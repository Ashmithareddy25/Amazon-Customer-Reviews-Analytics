B00020HEL6|5.0|Picture yourself sitting in a small little nightclub, where the drinks are stong, a smoky haze permeates the room, and a spotlight shines on Renee Olstead in a long gown singing these classics and making sweet love to the microphone. This CD is just outstanding. I listen to all types of music.... pop, hip-hop, jazz, new age, even some hard rock. This CD has made it into my top ten. I bought a second copy that is one of 12 CDs that fit in the console of my car. Don't hesitate on this one folks, you won't be disappointed.
B0007O38F8|3.0|50 Cents Massacre album is just that a massacre, however if you are a true 50 fan you would buy it and realize that he put the CD out for ladies. Listen to the hot songs, skip the rest and know that 50 is the man and he just made crazy change off this album. Purchase it if you are a true fan, this is not Get Rich or Die Trying status. More like a thank you for loving me now listen to me some more. Nice beats on a couple of tracks some I could do without but all in all I give it 3 stars. If you blaze and listen then I would give it 4 stars.
B0000TB01Y|3.0|While Stephen Schwartz is unquestionably a Broadway veteran, Wicked is not his strongest score. The talent on the recording is exceptional, but there are few songs that actually stir the blood, and some of the rhymes are almost painful they are so forced. However the Act 1 finale called Defying Gravity is almost worth the price of the CD in itself.  <br /> <br />Idina Menzel, Kristen Chenoweth, Joel Grey, and Norbert Leo Butz all display ample talent, which undoubtedly made this show the smash hit it became. But this is why she won a Tony award and the score did not.
B00003CXDV|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites, with the exception of maybe 10 minutes total, I laugh through the entire movie, every single time that I see it (30+).  As long as you've seen even a few episodes of any of the Star Trek series and are a fan of laughing this movie is a MUST see/have, this is one of those movies you want to watch over and over, when I first saw it in the theater, the 3 people I was with and I all wanted to see it again immediately, though that was already the last showing :( <br />Even the concept is funny, (mostly based on the original Star Trek series) the actors from the tv show \\"galaxy quest\\" haven't done any acting, except for that show in a long time, they just attend the 'trekkie' conventions signing autographs, but at the convention is a small group of actual aliens who ask the captian to come with them and help fight off the bad guy endangering their species, unfortunately the captian is drunk and thinks it is just \\"a gig\\" in a overly big fans basement.  He doesn't realize that it was all real until he gets 'beamed' back to earth and then trys to convice his costars that it is all real.  The aliens come back for more help and they the whole crew gets beamed aboard, much to their shock and amazement.  Now the crew who doesn't want to admit that the \\"historical documents\\"  (the galaxy quest tv show) were not really historical documents but just entertainment, must try to help the aliens fight the bad guys based on their memory of what they did on the show.   <br />A great line-up of characters--including Guy -- \\"crewman #6\\" who is scared the whole time knowing that, \\"crewman #? \\" is always put on the show so he can be the first to die. <br />A must see/own.
B000089QEN|5.0|Vanity Fair is far from the usual 19th Century novel, most deal with themes of misery, scorn, lost love and dejected women.<br /><br /> Becky Sharp in contrast is a go getter of a girl, fueled by her anger at having all the disadvantages of low birth weighing heavy around her neck, she sets a course for the riches and rewards she thinks she deserves with ruthless abandon.<br /><br /> Becky is kind of 19th Century Alexis Carrington (Dynasty) and is exqusitely played by Natasha Little who is beautiful, engaging, seductive and a real little monster all at once.
0790731940|4.0|With a renewed interest of the \\"Western\\" genre in 80's & 90's(YOUNG GUNS, TOMBSTONE, UNFORGIVEN) and classic tv series being made into films,MAVERICK was a natural. To sum up the film, it is just a plain fun. Richard Donner and Mel Gibson take their collaboration from the LETHAL WEAPON films (and even take Danny Glover along for a hilarious cameo as far as even saying \\"I'm getting too old for this  ----!\\") to make a very satisfying comedy-adventure-western.  Everyone seems to be having a good time in this film and the audience is brought along for the ride.  James Garner who originated the roll on tv is brought back as Marshall Zane Cooper.  Mel Gibson is perfectly cast in the lead and is so likeable and engaging that no matter what predicament he gets himself into, he's going to get out of it.  The plot is mainly Maverick trying to get to, and raise funds for, a poker tournament on a Louisiana steamboat. Along the way he runs into hilarious obstacles and miscreant while meeting up with unsavory charactors etc.  Jody Foster on the heels of two major best-actress Oscar wins, plays it light and is surprisingly hilarious as card shark/con artist Annabelle Bransford. Alfred Molina (SPIDER-MAN 2) shows his versatility once again as bad-guy  \\"Angel\\", Maverick's arch enemy. Graham Greene is hilarious as the politically incorrect Native American,Joseph who is after the mighty dollar. Also, a who's who of veteran tv and movie character actors appear in the film during the marathon poker tournament making it fun to point them out. Lastly, veteran James Garner is good in everything he does.  The closing scenes with Garner & Gibson with a surprising revelation is one of the highlights of the film and totally satisfying.  Overall, fun, light, entertaining and perfect.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|...This is probably an overstatement, but nonetheless Jared Hess' Sundance favorite Napoleon Dynamite remains one of the most deadpan, funny-because-it's-so-stupid films ever made.  Set in smalltown Preston, Idaho, Napoleon is the kind of nerd that as Roger Ebert quoted \\"other nerds avoided.\\"  Bearing a plot as scarce as Britney Spears' outfits, the movie does in fact have some comedic points; beneath the \\"What the heck are they saying?\\" commentary one might say during viewing of this movie lies a rare kind of charm.  Napoleon Dynamite is the kind of film you either like or don't like, and you just may find yourself quietly cheering Napoleon on! <br /> <br />*NOTE: As an Idahoan myself, I both surprisingly enjoyed and was embarrassed at Napoleon Dynamite. This isn't going to win any Oscars, but it's definitely better than The Aviator.
B0006Z169S|5.0|'My favourite Single' may be a bit of an overstatement, because I only own 5,  no - 6, but none-the-less, I thought I'd make my first single review on such a excellent CD.<br /><br />An intro to my Delta Goodrem experience::<br /><br />In 2003, I purchased Innocent Eyes and thought it was rather average, and earlier this year I purchased Delta Goodrem's second album MISTAKEN IDENTITY because I looooved the title track, and decided to take a risk, and I am very glad I did, as the album is one of my 10 favourites of all-time.<br /><br />This single features my favourite song of the Mistaken Identity album, AND my all-time favourite song of hers (i.e the previosly unreleased b-side) SILENCE BE HEARD - I love the originality of this song. Se has Beth Gibbons written all over her when she sings the line: 'Is this what I get....', and piano is very very good, and the song is quite alternative-chillout. If this was a double a-side (with Silence Be Heard), I'm sure it would be #1 - at least in Australia! anyway 10/10<br /><br />Track 3 is How A Dream looks, which is kind of lame, but still quite good. The guitar is the only instrument present, and it sounds a bit like an acoustic version of 'To Have Abd Not To Hold' - form Madonna's Ray of Light album. (6.5/10)<br /><br />And Mistaken Identity is a song which I'm sure you have all heard, so I won't give you a description, but I will give you a 10/10 grade for it hehehe......<br /><br />And therefore, even if you are not a Delta Goodrem fan (I dont know why you're browsing this item, but anyway....), but think Mistaken Identity is quite good for a D.Goodrem song, I highly recommend it, and even if you don't like the song, I'm sure you will find pleasure in 'Silence Be Heard'<br /><br />96%
B00005JMX6|4.0|THE GIRL NEXT DOOR looks for all the \\"Unrated Version\\" stamps that unfortunately hide the figure of Elisha Cuthbert on the DVD box like this is a moron audience directed chick flick.  But inside the poorly advertised trappings is a nice little light film that is far better than the average movie aimed at the school age audience.  Credit director Luke Greenfield and his writers David Wagner and Brent Goldberg for instilling some sense of dignity and tenderness into this story about hormone-pumping highschool kids.<br /><br />Much of the success of this film must also be credited to Emile Hirsch who is surfacing as an actor to watch (if anyone has a chance to see him in THE MUDGE BOY you'll know what I mean).  He plays Matthew, a bright but naive highschool senior who depends more on his brain than his sexual prowess to make it through school.  His two fellow nerdy friends Eli (Chris Marquette) and Klitz (Paul Dano) may always be on the lookout for their first sexual experience, but the three boys do represent the saner side of teenage life.<br /><br />The story involves a new neighbor for Matt, one Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert), an ex-porn star who moves next door to housesit.  Slowly Danielle entices Matt into showing her around her new town, plays a few cute tricks on him until the playing field is level, and their adventure can begin.<br /><br />Trouble enters when Danielle's 'producer' Kelly (Timothy Olyphant) appears to re-claim his 'property' and Matt discovers Danielle's background.  The remainder of the film deals with how Danielle and Matt interact with Eli, Klitz and the entire highschool bunch and involve the town in a staged scandal that has its own rewards.<br /><br />The dialogue is fairly clever and more interested in matters of the heart than in matters of the toilet, and in the end there is much to be said for the philosophical stance the story takes.  The acting is good to excellent (especially fine are Hirsch, Cuthbert, Olyphant, Marquette and Dano) and the pacing is brisk and warmly entertaining.  I'm not sure why the 'Unrated' label is placed because this is a rather tame movie despite its subject matter.  If it is there as a marketing ploy, it didn't work in the theaters.  Maybe it will have a happier life as a DVD!  Grady Harp, March 05Dano) and the pacing is brisk and warmly entertaining.

067144901X|5.0|My daughter received this book for her First Birthday and a month later, I have it memorized and so does she in her own way!  As soon as I say the title, she starts laughing out loud - which she then does for every page in the book.  And as soon as I say, \\"three singing pigs say la la la,\\" she starts shaking her head \\"no\\" in anticipation of the \\"no no that isn't right\\" on the next page.  The second the last word of the book comes out of my mouth, she is opening the cover and pointing at the first page for me to read it again.  We now carry this book everywhere with us because it is an instant cheer-up when she gets fussy.  I cannot even begin to describe the joy this simple book brings her or the feeling I get hearing her laugh out loud no matter how many times we read it.  This is an ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE book for any child's library.
B00079018K|4.0|Kasabian has been making a serious splash in their UK home country, and their debut album from last year finally is released in the US, and not a minute too soon. Kasabian's sound is not unlike, but lighter, than the Music's heavy guitar sound, with more synths and even accoustic guitar.<br /><br />\\"Kasabian\\" (53 min., 13 tracks, plus one \\"hidden\\" track) has spawned 5 singles in the UK so far, and these are not surprisingly the stronger tracks on the album. In order of release those singles are \\"Reason is Treason\\", the breakthrough hit \\"L.S.F. (Lost Souls Forever)\\", the irresitable \\"Processed Beats\\", \\"Cut Off\\" and the album opener \\"Club Foot\\", a hard charging dance-along, sing-along. But there are other highlights, including the mostly instrumental \\"I.D.\\" and the entirely instrumental \\"Ovary Stripe\\", invoking space-rocking sounds not often heard since the 70's Hawkwind, just excellent!<br /><br />The Brits are again unleashing a lot of great new bands, Franz Ferdinand, Kaiser Chiefs, Snow Patrol, the Bravery, and Kasabian, just to name a few. Mostly great stuff, here's hoping that US audiences are up for it.
B000000W71|5.0|I was not familiar with Gary Moore until I saw several figure ice dance teams skate to his music - and spent hours attempting to identify the music, which turned out to be Still Got the Blues and Parisienne Walkways. When I discovered this cd and starting playing it, I was overwhelmed with appreciation - not only are these two renditions exceptional, but most of the other music on the cd is just as superb. This is a cd I listen to hours on end - both Gary's voice and the accompaniment penetrate deep into one's soul....and are indeed the musical equivalent of the perfect massage.  It is one of my top five favorites....and the best blues music I've ever heard. Highest recommendations!
B00004VVND|5.0|I still remember seeing this film for the first time in the theatres.  I was all of 10 years old and remember thinking it was such a cool concept.  The film was written and directed by Michael Crichton who of course has gone onto become of the most successful writers over the past 25 years with credits such as Jurassic Park, Twister, Disclosure, and many more.<br /><br />Set in the not too distant future, a high tech amusement park named Delos has been created for adults and populated with life-like and intelligent robots.  Three worlds are awaiting wealthy visitors including Roman World, Medieval World, and West World.  In these various worlds, guests can live out their wildest fantasies, all helped along by a cast of perfect robots.  You can become a king, or frolic in Caligula like fashion in Rome, or become a gunslinger.  All the while banks of computers and programmers keep everything running smoothly, unseen to the visitors and perhaps as a subtle dig at Disneyland.<br /><br />Peter Martin (Richard benjamin) and John Blane (James Brolin) are a couple of buddies who decide to take on Westworld.  Blane has been there before and quickly shows Martin around the very realistic western setting.  The two engage in bar fights and seduce women (robots who can perform sexually) and even have duels with a robotic gunslinger played by Yul Brynner, who looks like he just stepped out of The Magnificent Seven.<br /><br />Soon things begin to go awry.  The robots begin to act strangely.  First it's minor things such as female robots refusing the sexual advances of male guests but things then get much worse as the robots begin to not only hurt, but kill the guests!  Soon Martin finds himself being stalked by the robotic Brynner as Brynner cooly commands him to \\"Draw!\\"  Brynner's relentless pursuit of Martin and near indestructibility seem very familiar and it is pretty evident that James Cameron was inspired by this when he created \\"The Terminator\\"<br /><br />Benjamin was never a great actor although he played his role as the terrified park patron quite well.  Brynner is the real star with his nearly total lack of dialog and his glare that makes you freeze in terror.  For a movie made in 1973 they did a resonable job of recreating a digitized look through the eyes of a robot that was quite unique in it's day.  Also the robots look fairly authentic, especially when their faces are removed and you see the mass of wires and circuits behind them.<br /><br />Dated by today's standards this was a fun movie and nice to see pop up on TV every now and then.n was never a great actor although he played his role as the terrified park patron quite well.

B00079HZUM|5.0|Edward \\"Ned\\"Kynaston  is an actor in during the reign of King Charles. When the king outlaws men playing women on the stage, Ned's out of a job. Thrown to the 'wolves' and forced to sing in bawdy taverns to make a living, Kynaston is eventually rescued by his ex-assistant Maria, who is in love with him.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Stage Beauty. In particular I enjoyed Kynaston. He was quite believable as the victim of sexual abuse, and later as the consummate cross-dresser. I really felt he and the Claire had a great deal of chemistry.  I felt the actor who played the King did a great job, and the actor who played Kynaston's lover was excellent.<br /><br />The one thing I found difficult to believe was that Knyaston could not act men's rolls. Please.  Actors were expected to be versatile and play any part they were given, over the years he would have experience filling in for other actors, even if it was helping another actor run lines. This aspect seemed a little contrived.<br /><br />This was a great film for fans of historical romance, and period drama.
0765310015|5.0|Let me start by saying that I've never bean a big fan of fantasy series.  As a matter of fact, this is the first fantasy book I've bought.  The first time I tried reading this book was 6 years ago and back then it left me confused .  Fast forward to now, I was going on a vacation and needed something to read on the plane.  Steven Erickson's Garden of the Moons was the first book that caught my eye, so without thinking much I grabbed it.    Well, I'm glad I did.  I spent the entire 6 hour flight reading the book.  I was reading it while waiting in the airport, during the ride back home.  Well, you get the idea.  The plot is complicated and hard to follow.  There are a lot of interesting characters, way more than any other book I've ever read.  But if you put any effort into it - you're going to enjoy the book.  I was astonished at the amount of detail Erickson put into this world.  After finishing the book you feel as if you were born and raised in the Malazan empire.    Furthermore, there are no \\"heroes\\" to follow.  The book doesn't have your typical good guy/bad guy duels.  You won't find many Frodos or Saurons.  Instead all the characters have their positive and negative qualities, just like real people.  Everybody is pursuing their own goals and as the result strange aliances are born.    Without giving away more I'm gonig to say go ahead and read the book.  But only if you plan on carefully folowing the storyline.  Otherwise don't bother.
B00005JNQQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  The visual effects are so good that I didn't really care if there was a good story.  However, there was!  The son of an out-dated diswasher robot goes to the big city to find the great robot inventor and share some ideas that he has.  Along the way he meets up with Robin Williams who is a type of con-man robot with old parts and who is literally falling apart.  Williams is excellent in this role and is the first cartoon role where I could understand him without being out of breath. <br /> <br />The trip to the big city parallels for the robot inventor parallels Dorathy's trip to Oz in search of the elusive wizard.  In fact there is a door guard that kind of reminds you of the door guard from The Wizard of Oz. <br /> <br />We find that the great inventor has disappeared and an evil robot has taken over and has decided to force all old robots to the scrap heap, in an effort to sell robot upgrades instead of replacement parts. <br /> <br />The movie pokes fun at big business and their constant downsizing and cutbacks in service to increase their bottom line. <br /> <br />There are some amazing scenes such as a spectacular fall of dominoes and the trip that the young robot takes with the Robin Williams robot to the city. <br /> <br />This movie is very different than the usual \\"taking animal\\" animations that seem to be mandatory in these types of films these days.  With likeable characters and some good music and a good feel that kind of reminded me of a souped up version of the old Gumby cartoons.
B00008S2VG|2.0|Madonna never had a very good voice but some of her dance songs were ok. Now with A.L. It's just a bunch of very average songs and a noticeably aging singer trying to stay relevant.

B00005R2IS|5.0|Mel Gibson was originally dubbed over, as mostly all the other actors where also, to create an \\"English Language\\" soundtrack version of Mad Max for its worldwide distribution. Thus pre-DVD the only way to hear Mel's original voice (the one he had when he turned up with bandages across his face with blood under the patches and the casting agents knew they had found Mad Max, an outback young lad with some good looks and a penchant for licking out of the bottle all day long) was to get the Australian version of the film on video tape. Now on \\"Special Edition!! (Check to make sure this review is for that version as Amazon sometimes changes products and moves reviews!)\\" DVD you can hear Mad Max the way it was meant to sound - 1 track Australian mono audio - but to be honest why brother with any 5:1 digital upgrade or a 2:1 English track?... unless you can't understand the original audio, in which case just turn to the subtitles.<br /><br />1979 Mad Max made its break onto the scene for one reason and one reason alone - the dawn of \\"Ultraviolence\\", Mad Max was instantly slapped with an X rating in Europe and was heavily criticised for being bloody graphic and too obscene for most viewers, George Miller had in fact delivered on very little blood on the screen, creating instead intensive bullying and quick flash cuts, probably dummies going under trucks or the jump cut subliminal frames of eyes jumping out of their sockets before a crash, people had never seen this kind of violence on the screen before, George Miller having himself already produced a violent twenty minute test film \\"Violence in Cinema Pt 1\\" (1971), knew there was a market for this thing, and there was, Mad Max produced several memorable posters for the first movie, each one either a cartoon or a still of anything other than Mad Max, the artwork always seemed to make people believe they where walking in on some sort of high budget Australian sci-fi violent action film, when in fact they where just viewing a bunch of guys with a 35mm camera, sticky tape and no fear of the brand new superbikes that could do 200 mph on the back roads of Oz. Peter Jackson obviously watched re-runs of this while making his Bad Taste. Low budget film makers know that Mad Max is probably just as important as Evil Dead that came out two years after it, in terms of how to make a low budget film that works. Just look at Mad Max, no one had two coins to rub together, yet they have a movie that spawned no less than two sequels and made an A-list Hollywood actor out of the lead, that is not bad going at all.<br /><br />The result is a very mish-mash of acting inabilities, poorly directed non-violent stuff, wonderful atmosphere, nice amateur camerawork, film speed ups to create the illusion of faster motion, that mostly actually work,  but it is long and drawn out, taking well over an hour for Max Rockatanski to loose some loved ones, going after the \\"Toecutter\\" a biker and his crew for a bit of road rage and revenge, this is the first film in which children are murdered (all suggestive; like a ball and shoe rolling down the road) because of bad driving, people visibly go under trucks and some `burnings alive' but nothing that is graphic (the most graphic scene being a severed hand hanging from a chain) it was the illusion of manic bikers going psycho on the streets that was so easy for everybody at the end of the 1970s and start of the 1980s to believe, so naturally they bought into all the stuff because aristocratic systems had man blaming each other for their own problems and not bad management of government, the \\"Halls of Justice\\" scenes in which arrested druggie bikers who kill are set free because of a technicality, all of this to people was very real at the time, a real fear, then suddenly a victim hero emerges from the rubble to clean up the mess himself, Mad Max is a bit of a defining moment in the genre, generated a better sequel in terms of budget and action, but this original is still very much the more important offering because of what it is.

B00078XGRO|5.0|A couple of... or maybe three years ago, buying a Paramount DVD meant 25-30 bucks for a BAREBONES release. <br /> <br />Now you get a 2-disc FULLY LOADED release with DTS and everything for just 15 bucks. <br /> <br />Incredible turnaround, especially when you think this movie, STAR TREK : FIRST CONTACT is the BEST MOVIE of the TNG crew, so they could have easily tagged a 29.99 price and still sell millions. <br /> <br />Anyway, it's cool for loyal TREKKIES who paid abusive prices for the barebones now they can get these SUPER-DUPER editions for much less. <br /> <br />Congratulations to PARAMOUNT, for understanding the consummers and not releasing their movies 4-5 times just because they want more money and don't care about the collectors. <br />
B0001IN0DA|4.0|Overall this was an excellent event. It was a little over-hyped though. Most off the matches were completly rushed as well, but they were still good. Here are the matches.  <br /> <br /> 1. John Cena vs. The Big Show 8/10 <br />A really good opener, but no 10/10 because it went a little to slow, but you can't really expect the Big Show to go fast. The ending is amazing when John Cena does the FU on the Big Show to get the victory. John Cena also became the new WWE United States Champion that night. <br /> <br /> 2. Rob Van Dam and Booker T vs. Rene Dupree and Robert Conway vs. Mark Jindrak and Garrison Cade vs. D-Von and Bubba Ray Dudley 7/10 <br />This was a pretty good match, and it was entertaining. The problem was that it went kind of slow until the last few minutes. Booker T was literally in the ring the whole time until almost the end when it started going crazy. Rob Van Dam hits a five star frog splash on Rob Conway to get the victory and to retain. <br /> <br /> 3. Christian vs. Chris Jericho 9/10  <br />A really good match. Good wrestling finally came from both men here. I was really impressed with Christian because I did not think he could do it. The ending is really suprising when Trish comes to the ring and makes it look like she is helping Jericho, when she is really not. Trish slaps Jericho REALLY HARD and then Christian some neat move. Christian and Trish walk away together and then kiss, while Jericho looks on from the ring looking furious. Big suprise to me. Good match do not skip. <br /> <br /> 4. Randy Orton, Batista, and Ric Flair vs. Mick Foley and The Rock (Handicap Match) 10/10 <br />An excellent match. Its kind of hard to explain everything that happened but some of the good parts was when The Rock punched Ric Flair really hard in the mouth because he said WHOOO! to him. Another kind of funny part was when Batista or somebody (I think Randy) swung Mick and he hit the steps. I was suprised Mick even got up. Dissapointing ending when Mick Foleytook out Mr. Socko but when he did thta, Orton came and did the RKO on him. The Rock and Mick look sad, but then they shake hands. Another good match, DO NOT SKIP. <br /> <br /> 5. Sable and Torrie Wilson vs. Miss Jackie and Stacy Keibler 6/10 <br />Kinda bad. This match was REALLY SHORT, but it had like one or two good moves in it. You really can't expect much from women's match though. Mostly a guy match, so if you like these girls then wath it. If you really don't care watch it or skip it (mostly skip it).  <br /> <br /> 6. Chavo Guererro vs. Nunzio vs. Jamie Noble vs. Tajiri vs. Akio vs. Funaki vs. Shannon Moore vs. Ultimo Dragon vs. Billy Kidman vs. Rey Mysterio (Crusierweight Open/Guantlet Match) 9/10 <br />This match was pretty good, although it was kind of rushed. The match started of well with Ultimo Dragon vs. Shannon Moore until Jamie Noble started dominating. On one of Jamie Noble's pins, he pinned Funaki in 3 seconds! Jamie Noble was then later eliminated by Billy Kidman (I think) after Noble got Nunzio counted-out. Sadly, Akio never got to wrestle because he tried to help Tajiri when he was fighting Rey Mysterio, but Tajiri accidently missed Rey and spit that green stuff in Akio's face. Chavo gets the victory over Rey to retain with his father's help.  <br /> <br /> 7. Brock Lesnar vs. Goldberg 5/10 <br />WORST MATCH OF THE NIGHT! Yes, this match was bad. I had hard time believing it too. I thought this match was going to be cool, but it really sucked. When both men came to the ring (including Steve Austin as referee) all they did was stare at each other. After a while they started pushing each other, and this lasted for about eight minutes with a few stares in between. The crowd even started chanting \\"THIS MATCH SUCKS!\\". Towards the last few minutes of the match, there was FINALLY some wrestling going on. Goldberg hit the Jackhammer (or whatever its called) on Lesnar to get the victory. At the end, Lesnar flicks the crowd and Austin off. Austin thenstuns Lesnar. Goldberg came back to the ring and he and Austin started drinking beers together, until Austin stunned Goldberg too. Steve Austin carried the match bascially (even though he was only the ref). I kind of felt sorry for Lesnar and Goldberg though. Not worth your time really, so skip it. <br /> <br /> 8. Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty vs. Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin vs. Bradshaw and Faarooq vs. Doug and Danny Basham 8/10 <br />This match was better than the tag team match earlier. It was better because it had at least different people come in at all times (except for Faarooq who never came in). In the match, I thought it was funny how the Basham kept tagging each other to keep Scotty from tagging Rikishi. Towards the end everything went crazy. Bradshaw and Faarooq could have been the new tag champs because Bradshaw hit that knockdown with his arm (the one they say is from \\"hell\\") on one of the Bashams. Bradshaw then tried to do the same on Rikishi, but Rikishi then did a Samoen Drop on Bradshaw. From there Rikishi went to the Basham lying on the floor and sat on him REALLY HARD. This enabled him and Scotty to get the victory and retain. Good match. <br /> <br /> 9. Molly Holly vs. Victoria 7/10 <br />I was amazed thatthis match was pretty good. A lot of good moves here. Too short to explain anything though. Victoria gets the victory, and then Molly Holly gets her hair cut (turns bald). Molly tries to run, but she gets caught. This explains why Molly looks the way she does now. I actually felt bad Molly. <br /> <br />10. Kurt Angle vs. Eddie Guerrero 9/10 <br />Excellent match. Eddie was in control most of the match, until almost the end when Kurt got Eddie's ankle. It looked like Eddie was going to lose, but not quite. Eddie outsmarted Kurt when Kurt had his ankle, and then he turned around while Eddie untied his boot making it look like it was hurt. When Kurt turned back around, he got Eddie ankle, but Eddie pushed him away and Kurt had his boot in hishand. Eddie then did a roll-up (with is feet on the ropes) on Kurt which got him the victory to retain. <br /> <br />11. Kane vs. The Undertaker 7/10 <br />I was really dissapointed with this match. I say skip it because nothing much happenned here. The Undertaker gets the victory. The entances though are cool.  <br /> <br />12. Shawn Michaels vs. Chris Benoit vs. Triple H 10/10 <br />Good match. A lot action too explain, but the edning is a classic. Benoit gets the cross-face on Triple H and make him tap. Benoit then celebrates with Eddie Guerrero. DO NOT SKIP!, it is really good.
B003B1X80Y|5.0|The movie primarily depicts the adversities of first love. It is about a privileged and lively, headstrong over-achieving Southern debutante who loves to paint, who falls in love with a young mill worker in the small town, who in turn is a steadfast, smart poor boy who likes to read and work with his hands, where she spends the summer of 1940. Her rich parents naturally object, and drag her away from him. He writes every day, but her class-conscious mother intercepts the letters, and the heartbroken Allie (Rachel McAdams) doesn't find out until seven years later that the heartbroken Noah (Ryan Gosling) never stopped thinking about her. After World War ll, Allie completes her education and becomes engaged to a respectable men, Lon Hammond (James Marsden) whom she really loves. Lon is a nice guy, which makes the conflict less obvious to figure...well, you get the idea.<br /><br />Gosling and McAdams are so natural that one would believe they were really in love. The film freezes us into witnessing a love story as it unfolds, and before you know it, had jumped past our emotional defenses. We can see why the characters fall and stay in love, and at the same time, feel the reasons. One wants them to end up together. McAdams displayed a passion that rivals Natalie Wood's clinging and enduring faithfullness in &#34;Splendor in the Grass&#34; and imbues Allie with that radiant, breathlessly winning naive grace and charm that breaks hearts. We never have to wonder why Noah is falling for her. The movie is of course, about first love, and to appreciate it one must feel it and not think or analyze it too much. Sappy love stories aren't for me but this is anything but sappy. It is a heartwarming and beautiful story. Casavetes directs with a real connection to the story's feeling and humanity. And Nicholas Sparks (&#34;Message in a Bottle,&#34; &#34;A Walk To Remember&#34;), created such an old fashioned romance that probably no longer exists. Usually the book is way better, but I thought that this movie brought it to life!<br /><br />The film is told in flashbacks as it is read from a personal diary or &#34;notebook&#34; by an elderly man (James Garner) to an elderly woman (Rowlands) suffering from acute Alzheimer's dementia in the modern day scenes. To stir her memories, Noah reads from a notebook that recounts their, improbable romance... where they met as teenagers in pre-WWII America. Way back then for Noah, it was love at first sight, though it took him by silly antics to win Allie. But as La Rochefoucauld once said, &#34;All the passions make us commit faults; love makes us commit the most ridiculous ones.&#34;<br /><br />There were some inevitable changes, but really nothing much that would take it far from the book. At most, one can find oneself caring even more for Noah and Allie. If you love romance movies, this is one to see. The cinematography is evocative and visually stunning from beginning to end, and the music never overkills. It is an absolutely beautiful transformation from book to big screen . A keeper and an unforgettable film.I thought that this movie brought it to life!<br /><br />The film is told in flashbacks as it is read from a personal diary or &#34;notebook&#34; by an elderly man (James Garner) to an elderly woman (Rowlands) suffering from acute Alzheimer's dementia in the modern day scenes.

B0002ONC4K|3.0|Ok, Ok, I purchased this cd to hear their version of \\"Eight Miles High.\\" It is fairly easy to understand why East Of Eden never made it. There is a mixture of Middle Eastern, some jazz, a mix of King Crimson during the \\"Lizard\\" era, and maybe even some Zappa. The songs aren't bad, there just isn't thread of continuity to hang one's hat on. Definitely a freaky bunch. By the way, \\"Eight Miles High\\" version is a combination of violin, drums, sax, and other instruments, not great, but not bad.
B00005JNQQ|4.0|Unlike the Pacifier that \\"entertained\\" (I use that term loosely) without really giving a message, Robots entertains more thoroughly and gives a somewhat cliched but very important message that kids of all ages should know.      Rodney Copperbottom, the main hero and inventor, has been getting \\"hand me down\\" spare parts ever since he was a child.  His family is poor and can't afford the \\"upgrades\\" he deserves.  One day Rodney decides to go to Robot City to find a great inventor who proclaims that everyone is special, regardless of how shiny they are, because he wants to become an inventor.  Complications arise and Rodney and friends end up having to save the robots who are considered junk.    What follows is a bunch of laughs and funny situations, most of which have been done before.  But it has a good cast of people including Ewan McGregor, Halle Berry and, of course, Robin Williams.  The animation is great and there are some nice action sequences that really made me smile.      Having been created by the team that brought us Ice Age, Robots injects some similar mechanics.  In Ice Age we had Scrat (who returned in a preview for Ice Age 2...poor Scrat, so funny) and in Robots we have Rodney's washing machine assistant, a small flying robot Rodney created to help his father.  He adds some funny scenes to the mix in a lovable way that Scrat and his eternal quest for the acorn did.  Very cute.    I guess in the end if you were to compare this movie to say Incredibles or Finding Nemo, you'd find this movie lacking.  But where I consider the Pacifier to be junk as far as a family film goes, this movie is gold.  Take your kids, friends and those young at heart.  It has a great (if cliched) message about how even those who don't have the most expensive upgrades or the most shiny parts can make a difference.  And I think that while this message has been seen a lot in movies, kids still need to hear it.  It's a good message.  And it's a good movie.  Overall not a bad way to spend 90 minutes of your Friday night.
B000002LCX|5.0|\\"Strangeways, Here We Come\\" brought an end to what is probably the most remarkable 4½-year, organically whole recording career in the history of popular music. The Smiths were wise to not try to follow up \\"The Queen Is Dead\\" with \\"Our Greatest Masterpiece, Part II\\".  However, since they probably did not know that it was to be their last new album, \\"Strangeways\\" has the feel of a transitional record, much like \\"Meat Is Murder\\".  But while \\"Meat Is Murder\\" would have ended the band's career (not that it threatened to) with something of a whimper, \\"Strangeways\\" ends it with a bang.<br /><br />The clich&eacute; of the \\"sophomore slump\\" has been too much of a reality for some artists .  The Smiths managed to eschew this with \\"Hatful of Hallow\\", which, though it was more of a collection than a proper studio album, contained some of the the band's greatest material.  Following what might be called a \\"junior slump\\", The Smiths delivered their masterpiece, \\"The Queen Is Dead\\".  Having  leap-froged the sophomore slump, they were now back at square two, so to speak.  Following up a masterpiece can be as arduous as delivering on the promise of a great debut.  Although a masterpiece gives a band some room to maneuver, it also sets a high standard to live up to.  This what The Smiths faced as they entered the studio for what was to be their final recording together.<br /><br />\\"Strangeways\\" turned out to be a Janus-faced record.  The band tried to move forward with more ornate production, but they generally ended up sounding better when they stuck to what had always worked for them.  The longer and shorter songs sit comfortable among one another, even if the longer songs can feel too long at times.  \\"Girlfriend In A Coma\\" is a truly classic Smiths song, with its two minutes filled to the brim with every ounce of bitterness, love, and irony that Morrissey can muster.  (And what better setting for a Smiths song than a hospital?)  On the other hand, \\"Paint A Vulgar Picture\\", at 5 ½ minutes, is probably the most entertaining song on the CD, and one of the best songs that Morrissey has ever written.  A swipe at the record industry's efforts to milk artists for all that they are worth, Moz still manages to splice in verses about how he has lost his true love. The song has also proven to be pretty ironic given the fact that The Smiths' own catalog has gone through extensive re-issuing and re-packaging, including several best of's and most of's.  (Another swipe on the CD, \\"Death of a Disco Dancer\\", - featuring Moz on piano - is less effective than \\"Panic\\", the band's other swipe at the same subject.)<br /><br />Among the other songs are the guitar-less \\"A Rush and a Push and the Land is Ours\\", which kicks of the disc with energy and aplomb, and expresses Morrissey's typical sentiments without crashing into caricature.  (Note Morrissey's wonderful growling as well.)  \\"I Started Something...\\" - in which Moz ruins a perfectly good friendship by saying \\"I love you\\" - \\"Stop Me...\\" - in which he gets beat up on the way to meet someone he loves - and the string-laden \\"Last Night I Dreamt...\\" are also bona fide Smiths classics.  Meanwhile, \\"Unhappy Birthday\\" and \\"I Won't Share You\\" are smaller but equally valuable gems, and \\"Death At One's Elbow\\" is a nice slice of Smiths-style rockabilly.<br /><br />On the whole, The Smiths may have slipped a bit from \\"The Queen Is Dead\\" on their final album, but they had plenty of room to do so.  They still ended up with a brilliant record.  It was wise and brave of the band to challenge themselves, even if the best songs on \\"Strangeways\\" are not necessarily the result of this.  Moreover, it was clear from this album that the break-up was not due to the creative well running dry, but rather, to the personal and creative differences between Morrissey and Marr. (I have heard one interpretation of \\"I Won't Share You\\" to be Morrissey's way of telling Marr that he didn't appreciate Marr's moonlighting on sessions with otherartists.) So while this may not be the *very* best Smiths record or the favorite of most fans, it is still worthy of 5 stars.<br /><br />And just for the record: Johnny Marr, speaking over a decade after \\"Strangeways\\" was released, said the following:  \\"I don't think this album is what we're about to most people.  They've decided that \\"The Queen Is Dead\\" is the better album and I don't agree.  All the songs are better, it's better produced and it's got better atmosphere.  I might be wrong but I don't think I am....It's the one Smiths record I've actually sat down and listened to since the break-up.\\" Morrissey, when asked how he felt about Marr's opinion that \\"Strangeways\\" was their best album, said,  \\"Well, it is.  We're in absolute accordance on that. We say it quite often.  At the same time.  In our sleep.  But in different beds.\\"  Food for thought, indeed.the *very* best Smiths record or the favorite of most fans, it is still worthy of 5 stars.

0743454529|2.0|This book has much to recommend it: a compelling situation; multiple viewpoints; an author's view that life is not about black and white, villain and hero; a timely medical ethics issue that gives readers a chance to consider the emotional warfare and contradictions which may result from medical intervention and technology. <br /> <br />Jodi Picault does engage the emotions, and I was sufficiently caught up in the characters to be unable to put the book down.  With one exception:  Sara was completely unsympathetic, impossible to empathize with as a mother.  I have five children and cannot imagine any mother being so completely obsessed with one child that she completely ignores and abuses the needs and emotions of the others. <br /> <br />I feel betrayed by the ending.  It's a total cop-out, which is the reason this book rates only two stars.  It manipulates the readers, and actually makes me question and regret the real engagement and emotion I felt up to the last couple of chapters.  <br /> <br />I wanted more about Jesse. His reaction to the family dynamic -- withdrawing as much as possible, just going away -- is one worth exploring.  Why Picoult wrap-ups Jesse's character as she does is baffling, another cop-out. <br /> <br />I loved the parts about astronomy, and I loved the characters of Anna, Brian, Jesse, Campbell and Julia.  I liked the subplots involving the love story and the service dog.  Ultimately, though, this is the second ending of Jodi Picoult's (two out of two) that I have disliked and felt cheated by.  It will make me think twice about reading another of her books.
B00006879E|3.0|I have to admit to having real trouble enjoying this album. <br /> <br />It pains me to say such, because taken individually, I love most of the songs on it. However, taken as a whole, I find the album difficult to listen to. The arrangement on this album does not gel together very well; going from song to song comes as a brutal shock way too many times for me to handle. <br /> <br />IMO, if the album had been arranged a little better, it would be Massively improved. I kept trying to listen through anyways to try to at least come up with an arrangement I could feel happy with (so I could post it here!), but never made much progress. <br /> <br />All that being said, their music really is damn good, and if you don't have issue with albums not \\"flowing\\", then definitely pick this one up!
B00003CY6M|5.0|We enjoyed it very much, and would watch it again, sometime - highly recommended to romantic comedy fans. I don't agree with the negative comments of other reviewers.
0671799320|5.0|This book takes the reader into the inside of oil history, as empires rise and fall just because of abundance of oil or lack of it. We see today that energy has become an integral part of our lives, and the author's theory is that we live in the \\"Hydrocarbon Age\\" as \\"Hydrocarbon Men\\". I think this is the best book anyone should seek to educate him/herself on Oil. Really worth evry penny spent.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I have never seen this show before or heard about it as I don't watch tv much. But after I got through the first episode which was a bit slow especially the opening battle sequence, then I really started to get into it. <br />I think it was worth buying cos while it isn't a crash hot programme it's still entertaining. Some of the episodes are really good. <br />The only thing the DVD needs is a 'play all' button. I am not too keen on extra features as they are hardly good. Also, the DVD menu music sounds a bit like the one used on Roswell. And I wish I didn't see a resemblance between the Captain and Ryan in The OC - they are mostly mute and have kind of similar facials. <br /> <br />
B00005JNQQ|3.0|Took my son to this movie...who I have to say did not want to see this film, suprisingly her really enjoyed it!!!  He wanted to go see the Pacifier....anyway, I found this film to have a decent story line, but in some spots it seemed to drag...honestly.  There was a few spots were I actually fell asleep..ZZZZ....It did have some really cute and funny parts in it as well...Robin Williams did an excellent job in the film!!! If I were u...I would rent this one, and not take the extra cash to see it in the theaters....IMHO
B000002VQQ|5.0|This album means a lot to me.  The first time I heard it, i thought it was kinda pretentious and unfocused, but the second time it just clicked and now it's one of my favorite albums.  Patti Smith didn't do anything too radical here but what's important is that the album SOUNDS radical.  Smith took classic garage rock and fused it with wild, sometimes free-associative poetry.  The rollicking chant in \\"Land\\" sums it up perfectly: \\"Go Rimbaud!\\"  Both \\"Land\\" and \\"Gloria\\" (forever one of my favorite songs) borrow elements of classic rave ups but put them in startling new surroundings and it's as exciting as hearing Bob Dylan go electric for the first time.  Slower numbers like \\"Free Money\\" and \\"Kimberly\\" are no less intense.  Throughout it all, Smith is sexy, assured, poetic and commanding.
0440180295|4.0|Prayer of Serenity  <br />Slaughter House Five, by Kurt Vonnegut, deserves a reputation of being a great piece of American literature. The book follows a  man, Billy Pilgrim through his life. Billy believes tralfamadorians have abducted him. The reader believes that it's through these aliens that he learns to time travel. In the book, Pilgrim explores time to all the various portions of his life, many times returning to World War II where he was captured and held in slaughterhouse five in Dresden, Germany.  <br />One of the major themes of the book is fate. The prayer of serenity appears twice in the book stating that we need to change the things we can and be wise enough to know which things we can't change. Also the Tralfamadorians speak of fate. They say they know how the universe is going to end, but they do nothing to stop it. Vonnegut seems to say that war is one of those things we can't avoid, but we need to change the things we can about it, like the bombing of Dresden.  <br />Overall, the book's message is clear, and Vonnegut delivers his message in a very accessible way. The reader gains knowledge on fate and what they can do to apply it in everyday life. The story of Billy Pilgrim is enjoyable to read, and contains many new insights. <br />
B0006IIKS0|4.0|I read all the hype about the release of St. Anger and thought that perhaps this was the return to the glorious metal that they rung in the 90's with. I couldn't have been more mistaken. Now, nearly a year and a half later, I watched this movie, and found out why that album sucked so bad. It sbecause they were trying to do something they aren't.  While this is a very compelling look into their lives, I found myself wanting to like this album, but having a terrible time listening to it. You see the major musical conflicts in the music, however, the film shows you that perhaps its time to see these guys branch off and try something new.
0440178002|3.0|When I first read Shogun i thought it was fantastic, a work of art and the best book ever written etc, etc; However reading it again at a slightly older age i was dissapointed. Whilst it is a good story, if you are into epics, it's not utterly fantastic, a lot of the subtlety is pseudo and if we're honest the writing isn't up to the standard of Dickens (but then who is) as such it can't be a five star!! Five should be reserved for truly great works masterpieces that set the world alight, and this just isn't. It is not so much what is lacking,it is a very good book with plenty of depth but to be a classic a book requires that touch of genius that sets's it apart and this is something that Shogun (and indeed Clavell) just doesn't possess.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day took a risk with \\"American Idiot\\", and it turned out to pay off big time. The 'risk' is making an elaborate concept album in the year 2005. The term 'rock opera' was also thrown around, perhaps due to the fact that \\"American Idiot\\" is heavily influenced by The Who's late 60's material.    Luckily for the band, \\"Idiot\\" has at least 3 surefire hit singles, which helped it attain phenomenal mainstream success.    The title track is a powerful, insanely addicting, political punk anthem. We've heard this before, but it's never seemed to have more impact.     The big hit \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" is a dark, moody albeit downright catchy slab of pop/rock perfection. \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" is another downbeat power ballad that has a shot at pop chart success (assuming the band releases it as a single).    The real winner is \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\", a 9 minute multi-faceted suite. \\"Homecoming\\" is the same idea, and another winner. The latter features some sections that remind me of \\"Grease\\"-style, sockhop rock (saxophone and all). They're both very ambitious, and reward you after repeated listens.    Other highlights include the anthematic \\"We Are the Waiting\\", the manic \\"St. Jimmy\\", the dreamy \\"Extraordinary Girl\\" (with its slight Indian sound), the Oi-infused punk of \\"Holiday\\", and the reflective closer, \\"Whatsername\\".    It's also great to see a thoughtful, creative album like this attain massive commerical success in addition to its critical kudos. It proves that the general public aren't always American Idiots.
B0006SSOHC|1.0|I rented this and what can I say? Well... you can't use that type of language here at Amazon but I'll just go with it... <br /> <br />Awful acting? Check. <br /> <br />Awful story? Check. <br /> <br />Awful direction? Check. <br /> <br />Awful villian? Check. <br /> <br />Awful chemistry? Check. <br /> <br />Awful ending? Check. <br /> <br />To have this movie as a 3.5 star average and to even have ONE five star rating is a crime against God, humanity, and cinema... and maybe not in that order. If you are the brainless sort that finds Fear Factor to be \\"good television\\" then by all means, buy this NOW.
0316172324|5.0|Gladwell has made the obvious---obvious.  Think about the first time that you met your wife...you get that bolt of lightning in your stomache, its mixed with lust of course but then it settles down to some thing more permanent.  When you are with your beloved you are constantly getting affirmative reactions from her eyes, her veldtenschund and her very being.  So you get married lust lasts about 2 years and by then a baby now makes your family 3 and you can bond with your wife on a more permanent basis.  This book describes how we get initial impressions that we call intuition, understanding or a general gut feeling.  We do it all the time.  Look at your surroundings and see how people are conversing, sizing each other up and having a dance of feelings which sometimes have nothing to do with their expression.  Gladwell intimates that we are hard wired to do this from birth--the flight or fight syndrome makes a good case for following his ideas as men as hunters had to make decisions in the blink of an eye in order to get food, clothing, shelter and a mate that would give   him a helper.  One thing that could have been tied in here is the phrenomes that humans have.  Phrenomes are scents that men and women have that we are not aware of. It is thought that these phrenomes have something to do with the attraction of a woman to a man or vice versa.
B00027LCR6|4.0|Having exhausted the digital remaster and enhanced CD routes already, Bowie moves on to another -- and definitely fan-friendly -- reissue program with his deluxe anniversary editions. Thankfuly EARTHLING, which was reissued simultaneously with OUTSIDE and HOURS, doesn't need to wait to 2007 to get the reissue it deserves. <br /> <br />When first released in 1997, this album was a definite departure from the grunge-inspired OUTSIDE. Unlike that hypernarrative, EARTHLING takes its inspiration from earlier albums like HUNKY DORY for its non-sensical lyrics and puts them in the (then new) techno-surroundings. The result is nine very strong songs, many of which are certainly strong contenders for singles including those chosen (\\"Little Wonder\\" and the still topical \\"I'm Afraid of Americans\\"). <br /> <br />Now, it gets the same digital perfection that the enhanced edition had without the Bowienet connection. Instead, this limited edition comes with a second CD containing many of the remixes that appeared on singles and promotional releases. True, you get the same song twice (or even three times) in a row but the versions are different enough to stand out on their own while still giving an overall fluid flow. The highlight of this disc is a new look at the old classic \\"V-2 Schneider.\\" <br /> <br />This is a definite must for all Bowie fans, and for all fans of this album. It's recommended, but if you're indifferent, try the bonus track version released six months earlier.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|I'm torn.  [...]  Taking out Phil Spector's production seems like a crime, but sounds like an improvement.  Paul McCartney remixing this album seems selfish, but (after all) much of it is his work.  I'm forced to go middle of the road.    My overall opinion is needed of the sessions before I proceed.  This is the Beatles at their worst.  That cannot be blamed on their beligerence of one another.  Similar working conditions brought about the bloated masterpiece \\"The White Album\\" and what is perhaps the band's greatest achievement \\"Abbey Road.\\"  These sessions were never really meant for an album.  \\"Abbey Road\\" should have been the Beatles' swan song and not \\"Let it Be.\\"  Both musically and as a bookend to their legacy, \\"Let it Be\\" leaves much to be desired.    But I see both versions as above average albums.  The original is decent material with a full-blown wall of sound production, via Phil Spector and the new one is decent material stripped to its bones.  Both are three star albums and either way, you get the band's least consistent album.  So, I wasn't really dissapointed with this release.  \\"Let it Be\\" wasn't a great album to begin with.  But the bottom line is mediocre Beatles is far better than no Beatles.    Overall:  6 out of 10.
B0000C6K09|2.0|While this 4-CD set does offer one of the most comprehensive collections of film music by the 20th century's greatest composer, I was very disappointed that they didn't have Williams himself conduct, or use original tracks from the movie scores.  [...]
B00005J6UP|5.0|This is the kind of stuff every kid dreams about. Having an adventure with your best friends that includes treasure, being chased by bad guys, avoiding the booby traps, and all the while having a massive blast. The Goonies is wickedly fun, includes all the above mentioned, and more. The story is built around such solid characters, characters that you see yourself in, your friends in, your family in. These everyday people are thrust into a wild adventure.  <br /> <br />Mikey (Sean Astin-- look at how little he is!!) and his brother Bran (Josh Brolin) live in Astoria, where their house is being forclosed on by men who want to build a country club over it. Mikey dreams of finding a buried treasure, \\"rich stuff,\\" to save his house and the houses of all his friends, who are also being forclosed on. His father works in a museum and has kept priceless artifacts in the attic, where Mikey, Bran, and their gaggle of friends find a treasure map. Mikey can't resist. He has to find this treasure and find out if the stories his father told him about the legendary pirate One Eyed Willy are true.  <br /> <br />Joining Mikey are his hilarious friends-- Chunk, a clutsy eating machine; Mouth, the joking talker; and Data, the inventor. Andy the cheerleader and her friend Steph tag along too, mostly so Andy can schmooze with Bran. And of course, they are being chased by three inept, money hungry criminals. It's such a whirlwind adventure, so much fun, an Indiana Jones flick of sorts. There aren't that many great adventure films. This is one of the top ones of all time.
B00005B36H|5.0|After reading several of the previous reviews, I just had to laugh. The incredible energy and faith we TOOL fans have in the band just amazes me... I doubt you'll find a more dedicated group of fans. In my opinion, there are two groups of people; One: those of us that love TOOL and will forever think that MJK and the rest can do NO wrong, and two: those that don't like TOOL and never will. You'll either think they're endlessly talented or complete hacks, I've never met a mediocre TOOL fan... it's all or nothing. That said, if you're reading these reviews trying to decide whether or not to buy a TOOL album, that might not be a good idea. I love TOOL, don't get me wrong, and Lateralus is my favorite TOOL album... however reading our biased reviews is not going to assist you. My advice: buy or borrow a TOOL CD, listen MANY times (maybe more) and just reflect on it. You'll either get it and become TOOL obsessed, and start discussing the meanings of songs with your friend and wearing TOOL t-shirts, or you won't. Oh, we TOOL fans also like to believe we're incredibly intelligent and that TOOL's music is esoteric also... be prepared ;).
068484267X|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. It's very touching and we'll written. I compare it to my other favorite, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, but from a boy's perspective on growing up in poverty instead - and dealing with an alcoholic father too... the part that I find was a bit of an embellishment was when he talked about how big his penis is.
B000002UDB|4.0|When John Lennon started his solo career in 1970, he said his favorite Beatle's album was \\"Magical Mystery Tour.\\"  It's not really hard to see why, considering the three songwriters (John, Paul, George) all preferred their own material, and this is one of the only albums that featured a majority of John's songs.  And though the songs of all three writers are great here, critics and fans have rated this as one of their least favorite Beatl's albums.  I've never fully understood why. <br /> <br />Well, Yes, it's true that its more of a singles compilation than a proper album, but I see nothing wrong with that.  The singles are amazing by themselves, so why do people believe they lose their savor when packaged together?  \\"Magical Mystery Tour?\\" \\"I am the Walrus?\\"  \\"Fool on the Hill?\\"  \\"Penny Lane?\\"  \\"Strawberry Feilds Forever?\\"  It's a bad thing that all these songs of a generation are put in one place?  Someone pointed out to me that John's \\"Baby, You're a Rich Man\\" was the Beatle's worst song, and even if you agree, it's hard to argue with what's here.  Maybe someday this album will get the respect it deserves. <br /> <br />Overall:  8 out of 10.
B000002J09|5.0|If you're into rock music, and you feel like you need to read another review to learn about Led Zeppelin IV, then you might as well consider crawling back to that rock, that you were spending your life under. No, I'm not trying to be rude. I honestly don't know another band and album that meant so much for the development of hard-rock, metal and all the related styles. With over 22 million copies sold, Led Zeppelin IV is among the top 10 best selling musical albums ever. And of them, it's arguably the most deserving of these insane sales figures.<br /><br />This album shows Led Zeppelin in their full strength. There's so much creativity, so much excellent songwriting and flawless passionate performance, that trying to find proper words to describe it is pointless. The unique fusion of heavier blues with straight out rock'n'roll and a healthy dose of English folk music, which has been Led Zeppelin trademark, is here in abundance. The songwriting is so strong, that I second what the other reviewer wrote, that any weaker song off Led Zeppelin IV could have become another band's career highlight. As for the stronger songs, well, who really needs an introduction to \\"Black Dog\\", \\"When The Levee Breaks\\", or \\"Rock'N'Roll\\"? And I'm not even mentioning \\"Stairway To Heaven\\", which, while heavily overplayed, is a strong contender for the crown of The Best Rock Composition Ever.<br /><br />\\"A must\\" is too lightweight characteristic for Led Zeppelin IV. You owe it to yourself to own it.
B00079018K|5.0|I'd never heard of this band and a co-worker had their CD on his desk and said it was like Oasis.  It was enough to interest me, but I hear a lot of other stuff going on here, regardless of the pigeonhole this band is going to get just because of hailing from Manchester/Leicester.  If you like Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, this is more like that than anything else I've seen it compared to.  Not to say it's a carbon copy, either. <br /> <br />I'm glad to say this is an entire CD of great songs, not just a front loaded CD with filler.  Very catchy stuff, it's too bad it will probably not see a lot of airplay (tho I'd love to be wrong there).  There are a lot of great melodies and electronic touches going on in these songs, of which the latter will confuse radio music programmers.  You'll have to have an \\"indie\\" style radio station to hear this on your local airwaves. <br /> <br />The songs are also very diverse, you don't feel like you're listening to the same song over and over, and they pretty much all stand alone very well.  The production is also great, lots of nice vocal layering and such.  I just have nothing bad to say about this CD or band, it was a great surprise.  Do yourself a favor if you like any of the bands mentioned as references and give this a shot. <br /> <br />

0767834739|1.0|This is one of the worst zombie movies I have ever seen in my life, and that includes the original Night of the Living Dead.    Apocalypse shows me a crew of people who are supposed to be converting a  video game to a movie, and instead decide to screw logic, reason, and sanity, and just make a movie that will catter to devout, die hard fans of the series. Why does the story have to make sense?? Just slap Resident Evil on the cover and people will pay.    The story begins where the first RE left off. Alice is awakening in an Umbrella hospital and realizes the world is not what she knew. Things are...well they're sh*t Most people are either dead or undead, and the police are trying to create an effective resistance against the zombies. Hotshot, loss cannon S.T.A.R.S cop Jill Valentine takes leave of her suspension and walks into the RPD just in time to cap a few zombies. She then reminds everyone in a tone that is up to par with porn star acting \\"They're infected, you have to shoot them  in the head.\\"    Oh but it get's even better when Jill, her partner, and a reporter are trapped inside a church with two lickers. Alice bursts in on a motorcycle to save the day and the first question I have is, \\"How did she know they were there?\\"    Then they all get to battle hand to hand with a bunch of rotting graveyard zombies which is funny because A. How did the T-virus infect the already-dead-6ft-burried corpses? and B. why did they choose THAT moment to unearth themselves?  The choreagraphy looks good, but then again it's hard to not look like a bad ass when your opponent makes no attempt to defend himself.    Later after making a deal with the lead scientist for a ticket out of this nightmare, they go to a school to retrieve his daughter as their part of the arrangement.  Low on people and ammo in a school full of zombie kids, they do the smart thing and split up which means; yep you guessed it someone is going to die.    I loved the scene where they find out a nuke is coming to destroy the city.   Jill asks, \\"What Yield\\"  Alice, \\"50 Megatons\\"  Jill, \\"!@$! me\\"  Now, how does a police officer know the difference between nuclear yields..and WHY does it matter! It's a nuke! I don't think Umbrella intends on destroying half the city.    Watching Nemesis was just sad. Why is he after S.T.A.R.S members? In the video game it was because they were out to expose Umbrella's dirty secret. In the movie its....\\"because they're the best.\\" stupid stupid...    Resident Evil is how a zombie movie should never be done.  Horrible acting, a storyline full of holes and inconsistencies, and the feeling that the creators of this \\"movie\\" cared more about counting the money it would make rather than making somthing decent give this movie the 1 star is most certainly deserves.  Rent it if you want a good laugh, and if you want to watch a decent zombie flick try the new Dawn of the Dead.

0440180295|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut is back, and he couldn't have done better. Slaughterhouse-Five is possibly his most accomplished book, and may even be considered the best book of its time. This book has soared Vonnegut to the very top of the author list for many. It surpasses his former highest accomplishes and stands alone in a world of classic reads. The reader is sped down winding roads of space, time, and memory. A fast paced book fit for any age, Slaughterhouse-Five is entertaining, inspiring, and smart. Set in the main character, Billy Pilgrim's memory, Vonnegut bring us twisting through World War II, to present day, to planets as far away as Tramalfadore, where Billy had been abducted, and back again. We are pulled with Billy through his tribulations as he makes friends, and also as he makes a few enemies. The imagination weaved so richly and tastefully through the entire novel makes the reader at a constant hunger for more. Vonnegut's signature humor is nothing less than emanating from page 1 to the very end. Slaughterhouse-Five is on a deserving par to its peer novels such has Catch-22 by Joseph Heller and 1984 by George Orwell. It has become a classic American novel, and it is rightfully so. Vonnegut is not a \\"one book author\\". He is the type of author that makes his readers desperate for his entire collection. Slaughterhouse-Five, however must be a top priority and should be made the number one book on everyone's \\"To Read\\" list.
B0002OERI0|1.0|The music sucks and the political message is worse. [...] The Guitar sound is complete crap and the singing is juvenile and whiney. This album is a perfect example of society in decline.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|First of all this album is very different from \\"Deloused.\\"  After what I thought was one of the best albums ever, I could not have had higher expectations, and \\"Frances\\" exceeded them tenfold.  This is not easy music to get into, unless you've followed these guys from the ground up.  You know how most music out today sucks?  Yeah, you know.. Alterbridge, Simple Plan, garbage like that.  If you're like me, you've bought every Tool album there is and wore them out, but now you still crave more, and you want something fresh, something you never heard before.  You just can't satisfy that craving any longer.  Look no further.  Anybody who thinks they're some kind of music expert, who thinks they're up to date, who thinks they've starved every great band for everything they're worth, and hasn't heard TMV or ATDI, you got some catching up to do.  If you need convincing, buy \\"Frances the Mute,\\" and prepare to be blown away.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|I came to this movie with high expectations, having heard a lot of good things about it. It seemed tailor-made for someone with my past and present obsessions, including 1930s and 40s Hollywood, pulp science fiction magazines, cheesy old sci-fi movies, and Raiders of the Lost Ark. And there's no denying there was a recurring thrill of recognition of those things during much of the movie.     But fairly soon it began to suffer by comparison to some of the old films it pastiches. I think it first occurred to me during the scene where Polly sits in the back seat of the aeroplane reading the book... and actually reads it. A great director like Howard Hawks could have despatched that exposition in fifteen seconds flat on a bad day, but here it seems to plod along for minutes. Sure, the fast action scenes need to be punctuated by less intense moments to let the audience draw breath, but those moments are better achieved by character, comedy and romance. Is this part of the pastiche, lovingly recreating the clumsy drawn-out exposition of those low-budget fifteen-part adventure serials of the 30s and 40s? Perhaps, but while a film like Raiders of the Lost Ark pastiches not the actual movie serials, but the serials as remembered by those who grew up with them, Sky Captain seems to pastiche the real thing, warts and all.    And Joe Sullivan (I had to look up the name in the Internet Movie Database) never quite came to life, in the way that Indiana Jones did in the first five minutes of Raiders. In some ways this is just a difference of character, Joe having an almost stereotypically \\"English\\" reserve (think David Niven's Peter Carter in the opening scene of A Matter of Life and Death). But whereas that film finally breaks through Carter's reserve, Joe goes through the whole movie not seeming to care much more about his adventures than the audience.    These issues aside there's a lot of good in here. Everything looks great, and even if the story doesn't hold the attention forthe duration, there's always something worth looking at, and a strong supporting cast of character actors. And there's a certain   excitement just in seeing the first example of what should be a new wave of \\"completely imagined\\" films.    The featurettes (on the 2005-released Widescreen Special Collector's Edition DVD) are excellent; the story of the film's genesis and production makes a better story than the film itself. One featurette includes some of director Conran's original demonstration footage, painstakingly put together on a PC over six years, which actually looks like genuine grainy black and white 1930s-film-on-videotape. I'd have loved to see a whole movie that looked like that, but it wouldn't have played well in the multiplexes.
0060174900|5.0|Finishing this book was the worst thing that's ever happened to me. The writing style was so clear and, for me, easy to relate to. When the story ended I grieved simply because I could not even imagine moving on to another author; but the sad truth remains, Sylvia Plath left us no other novels to cherish. <br /> <br />To put it simply: THE BOOK IS AMAZING in that the theme is clear and sucks you into Esther's (the main character) skin. While she goes insane it almost seems as if you are going insane with her. You never hear a diagnosis or the symptoms, and her sickness is real and natural and it becomes a part of you. The things she does are never explained but all fit together into a beautiful story that could never be mimicked. <br /> <br />Please, read this book.
B0007N1AI6|4.0|Any band that has been around as long as JP is bound to go through many changes. Just listen to \\"Living After Midnight\\" and \\"Painkiller\\" back-to-back and you'll get my point. \\"Angel of Retribution\\" marks not only the return of Rob Halford, one of the best Metal vocalists of all time, but also the return of Judas Priest to their classic sound.   <br /> <br />The original core of this legendary lineup is here. Along with Halford we have original members KK Downing, Glen Tipton, and Ian Hill. Scott Travis, who replaced long-time drummer Dave Holland in the late 80's, is retained, and in my opinion makes this a much better band than any former lineup.  <br /> <br />With Travis behind the drums you are guaranteed to have a few fast-paced, thrashing songs with double kicks that sound like a .50 caliber \\"Ma Deuce\\" bringing down an enemy fighter. However, the majority of the songs on this album more closely resemble something from \\"Hellbent for Leather\\" than \\"Jugulator\\". There is nothing I like more than that sound of a loud, Heavy Metal guitar crunching out a powerful, chunky rhythm, and this album has it in spades. The mix is great. I can crank this CD up in my truck, and it still sounds clean and powerful, not muddy and over produced. <br /> <br />The release includes an interview and several live tracks in DVD format which is why the CD costs a little more than average. In my opinion the extras add value to the release and are certainly worth the slight cost. I especially like slower version of \\"Diamonds and Rust\\". This version is mostly acoustic which allows the powerful lyrics to really stand out. This is unusual for me because I prefer the heavier, faster stuff, so that should attest to the quality of the performance. The CD itself is good, but the additional DVD makes this a must buy especially for the fans of the older Priest.   <br /> <br />I do not usually address other reviews because this is America and I feel we are all entitled to our own likes and dislikes.However, I will make an exception and address one reviewer who gave this album one star and was particularly harsh in his review: So far there have been 100 reviews of this album and they average 4.5 stars. Additionally, all of my friends who like Heavy Metal - the new stuff as well as the old school stuff - love this album. So, either 99% of all Metal fans are 30 something mullet heads with the emotional capacity of a 16 year-old or you don't know what you are talking about.

B0002EQ7E2|5.0|Paul Simon has been at the forefront of music, for as long as most of us can remember.  with a career dating back as far as the 1950's, and having already established himself with the seminal work, as the 'Simon & Garfunkel' duo.  It wouldn't have been unreasonable to think that his solo work, would have paled in comparsion.  Yet after a steady stream of steadily more accomplished solo albums, it wasn't until this his 9th studio album (Released in 1986), that he hit his creative peak, with his \\"Graceland\\" album.  An album that so beautifully (and some would argue 'Seamless'), fuses: Singer/Songwriter, Worldbeat, Contemporary Pop/Rock, African hymnal songs, and presented in such a largely accessible way, that it became one of the first 'World' music (or certainly 'World influenced albums), that was a huge hit in the west.   <br /> <br />It's not hard to see why this album was so easily accepted by the western music buying public.  With an elite cast of musicians that would eclipse most festivals, these were either musicians that were already huge on the musical circuit, or due to become big after having a hand in this recording...so people such as:  Linda Ronstadt (Vocals), Ladysmith Black Mambazo (Vocals), Youssou N'Dour (Percussion), Los Lobos' - Cesar Rosas (Vocals, Guitar), all contributed to the construction of this album, and their performances are beautifully captured (especially Ladysmith Black Mambazo, backing vocals, on some tracks) and remains a remarkably powerful album.  Possibly because the album covers so many bases.  (Possibly in an effort to appeal to as wide an audience as possible).  And so it proved to be as eclectic a record as Paul Simon ever recorded.  So you have the sublime Adult-orientated rock (\\"The Boy in the Bubble\\"), Poetic, articulate singer/songwriter tracks, for those seeking something a little more substantial (\\"Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes\\").  The glorious and irresistible catchy pop, of the hit single (\\"You Can Call Me Al\\"),torch-bearing hymnal African harmonies, ushering in broadly accessible world music (\\"Homeless\\").  <br /> <br />What is hugely impressive here, is the fact that each track is truly deserving of inclusion on this marvellous release, nothing on this album feels like it was included to fill out the album, and it's shift through various moods of being Exuberant, Poignant, Reflective, organic, and spiritual & Consistent remain unquestionably impressive.  In fact it was such a perfectly realised album, that when taken as an album whole, it all comes together to combine into making this one of the greatest albums released in the 80's.  For those that aren't huge fans of Paul Simon, but do appreciate his work, I (very) strongly urge you to pick this album up even if you only have a passing interest in his music.  This album not only helped open up the floodgates to Western ears appreciating (accepting??) World Music, but also remains his creative high point (both musically & Artistically)....you'll be surprised at just how well this album, has stood the test of time, with it still sounding as vital as it did back then (obviously, not as political important, as this was released around the Apartheid days), but few could argue it's cross cultural musical experiments, and become the album for which other culturally fused music was judged against.
B000058983|4.0|Let's face the facts: this is an album that only ascended to number 154 on the album charts when it was released in 1967.  It garnered less attention than releases by Bobby Goldsboro and the 1910 Fruitgum Company.  The liner notes accompanying the CD would like us to believe 'Forever Changes' didn't even crack the Top 100 due to a lack of promotion and touring by the band, and because of the flood of quality music released in the Summer of Love (ironically).  While those factors may have had a hand in precluding success... number 154?  There simply has to be more to it than that, and there is. <br /> <br />It's interesting to note that in offering up examples of the kind of competition 'Forever Changes' was up against, Ben Edmonds (author of the enclosed liner notes) cites such works as Captain Beefheart's 'Trust Us' and Tim Buckley's 'Goodbye and Hello'.  Talk about writing revisionist history.  While he does give a nod to The Doors' 'Strange Days', what became of The Beatles' 'Sgt. Peppers', Jimi Hendrix' 'Are You Experienced?', and Creams' 'Disraeli Gears'?  These are the sorts of albums that truly drew attention away from composer and lead singer Arthur Lee and 'Forever Changes'.  In fact, despite growing up surrounded by the psychedelic music of the 1960's, I hadn't even heard of this disc until recently.  But given the strong reviews here and elsewhere for this disc, by obviously intelligent and discriminating people, I decided to give it a spin over the laser.  I'm glad I did because it really is a quality album, clearly overlooked through the annals of time, but the rabid acclaim accorded it here and elsewhere is no doubt a bit cultish. <br /> <br />At varying times throughout this disc, Love has the capacity to sound like a number of good sounding bands of the mid and late-1960's, while at the same time sounding completely unique.  More than any other band, they possess a sound and style most reminiscent of The Moody Blues.  The opening track, of course gaining the pole position as the optimal choice for a hit single, 'Alone Again Or', possesses the qualities that make Moody Blues music what it is.  It's a brilliant acoustic number with mariachi overtones and orchestral support that is just right.  The third track, on the other hand, sounds a good deal like the Left Banke, best known for their hit 'Walk Away Renee'.  The Left Banke always sounded to me like they were singing through the fog, and 'Andmoreagain' has the same nuanced quality.  The seventh track, 'Maybe the People...' comes across as a Latino version of Chicago Transit Authority, and track ten ('Bummer In the Summer') takes an excursion into territory normally occupied by The Who.  The number is bass heavy with a great electric guitar lead solo picked like a banjo, and of course a great title. <br /> <br />Both the song titles and bass lines deserve seperate mention.  Many of the songs possess titles that never show up in the songs, predictably tracks like 'Maybe the People Would Be the Times or Between Clark and Hilldale' and 'The Good Humor Man He Sees Everything Like This', but also 'The Daily Planet' and 'You Set the Scene'.  One wonders what the message is, but as with Stephen Stills' 'For What It's Worth', we'll assume there's a logical explanation.  There are also a number of songs that offer up compelling bass lines courtesy of Ken Forssi, such as 'The Daily Planet' (another tune from Whoville), and 'The Good Humor Man...'.  As with the occasional riviting electric guitar solo's, these heavy bass lines do much to supplement songs built largely around acoustic guitars and orchestral accompaniment.  The closer on the orginal vinyl version, 'You Set the Scene' is, in fact, a wonderful mix of acoustics, bass, and horns in a rich seven-minute \\"big finish\\".  <br /> <br />The lyrics also deserve mention.  While they stand as the least compelling element of 'Forever Changes', they are certainly representative of the psychedelic notions that permeated music of the era.  Consider \\"they're locking them up today, they're throwing away the key, I wonder who it'll be tomorrow, you or me?\\" from 'The Red Telephone', or \\"Oh, the snot has caked against my pants, it has turned into crystal\\" from 'Live and Let Live'.  We also have, from the bonus track 'Wonder People', \\"I could be in love with just about everyone, I think people are the greatest fun\\".  While the lyrics are certainly poetic and avant-garde, they are also the most daunting reason why 'Forever Changes' can't truly be compared to its closest sounding cousin, 'Days of Future Passed'. <br /> <br />The Deluxe Edition of 'Forever Changes' is quite a production, and the album deserves it.  The liner notes are lengthy, thankfully informative about the album, the band, and their times, and are interspersed with interesting photographs and graphics.  The jewel case comes in a seperate protective cardboard liner with an additional band photo.  The bonus tracks are interesting, mostly instrumental versions and alternate, mono takes of tracks already on the disc, but also offering three new tracks.  For some reason we're given takes #22 through 38 of 'You're Mind and We Belong Together', most of which are false starts.  While it has a 'fly-on-the-wall' quality to it, it's hard to imagine who would listen to it more than once or twice. <br /> <br />This is a curious album, and I fully understand why so many people would feel it's an overlooked classic.  It nevertheless possesses very obvious shortcomings that explain why it has remained underground for so long.  The word-of-mouth promotion it has always received is to be valued however, because Arthur Lee and Love possess a niche appeal that is undeniable.  If you're a fan of 1960's psychedelia, you should surely give 'Forever Changes' a listen.  You may find yourself the member of a cult!
B0006SSOHC|3.0|Another reviewer made that statement, and gets the tone right in his review.  The movie's not for everyone, but really is, as another reviewer noted, only for \\"hardcore fans of the genre.\\"  It wants to have the shock, and existential morality, and plot twists of \\"Se7en,\\" but manages at best an ersatz echo of that masterpiece.  Still, if you loved Se7en, you won't regret at least renting and watching \\"Saw.\\"
B00005JN0T|1.0|What did I not like about this movie? Pretty much most of it, I have to be honest. Why oh why is the future always depicted as being like Times Square at 5pm on a Friday? There are always hundreds of people in the background walking in about 50 different directions. Nonsense.<br /><br />Will Smith Fresh Prince'd his way through the movie, weaving his Audi and/ or his motorbike through some of the larger gaps in the plot (who has their house demolished once they die? What the heck was that all about other than an excuse for Smith to escape/ defeat - once again - the robots). You hate robots for saving you? You sleep with a large, presumably loaded gun in your hands? You are a maverick cop? Come on, guys, this is awful. Straight out of the 'Will this do?' school of filmmaking.<br /><br />Based on a series of short stories? I think not.<br /><br />An awful movie that I'm sure will have plenty of 5 star *awesome* reviews from people who check their brains in alongside their coats at movie theaters.

0743454537|5.0|In this case, it was my first time to ever read a book written by Jodi Picoult.  I just finished this book about 10 minutes ago, and was so amazed by how much I loved it that I came straight to my computer to write this review.    This book tells the story of Anna, who is a child borne for what seems to be one purpose - to save her sister's life.  Her sister, Kate, is dying of leukemia, and Anna acts as her donor throughout her life.  As a teenager, she decides to seek medical emancipation from her parents, because she simply can not take it anymore.    I felt while reading this book that it was predictable, yet still it captivated my interest.  I could not put it down.  I also could not have been more wrong about the predictability.  The only thing even remotely predictable is the relationship between Campbell (Anna's attorney) and Julia (Anna's court appointed guardian during the trial).  I won't spoil the ending, because truly you need to experience it for yourself, but I never once saw it coming.  I *do not* cry easily - period.  I was sobbing throughout the last chapter of this book.    This book is beautifully written.  Picoult weaves a story so real, so tragic, but so full of love, that it would be a shame to pass this book by.  It truly has heart.  My next few weeks will be filled searching out her other books and finding time to read them.  This was a thoroughly good novel by an excellent author.
B00028HBKC|5.0|This movie does an excellent job in depicting the short, but powerful life of Jesus Christ.  This movie gives you a chance to see the death of Jesus Christ through the eyes of a spectator.  This helps you to understand the pain and suffering that He went through for us.  This movie is a must-see for all, Christians or not.  So grap a bucket of popcorn, a box of tissues, and be ready to see a life-changing event within yourself and others.
B00005V9IL|3.0|The Abyss is one of my all time favorite films. I don't know what everyone is talking about when they say it is slow paced. I got the VHS tape many years ago and that thing is worn out. <br /> <br />One day I saw the DVD special edition \\"uncut\\" version and was baffled. The plot is needlessly expanded - it gives a COMPLETELY different flavor to the movie. I will not go into detail, but it is very deliberate and quite goofy. I regretted ever seeing the special edition and I'm trying to forget it. James was smart to cut what he did. <br /> <br />I highly recommend the non-special edition, but not this.
B0007P3582|4.0|This record is the overhyped sophomore effort from 50 cent. It fail quite short of the hype. This record does not touch 2003 GRODT lyrically, but musically it may have eclipsed GRODT. This record SHOULD go down in history for having some of the finest club beats ever constructed. I myself am not much of a fan of club rap, but even I cannot deny the high calibur club instrumentals presented on The Massacre.<br /><br />The legendary Dr. Dre is surprisingly scarce on this CD. I was even more shocked to find out that the bonafide club classic \\"Disco Inferno\\" was NOT produced by Dr. Dre, but by a duo C. Styles and Bang Out. The pounding pianos and snares of this track almost guaranteed me that it was produced by Dre, but as it turns out I was wrong. This is one of the strongest tracks on the album, despite the horrific chorus. 50 here, like the rest of the CD, is lyrically tame and harmless and fits perfectly over the beat of \\"Disco Inferno\\".<br /><br />The next track I knew from hearing the first 5 seconds of it was produced by Dre. \\"Outta Control\\" sounds like another bouncing beat that should have been on Dre's final effort \\"Detox\\". The musical backdrop here is phenomenal, possessing the menacing feeling of a sort of \\"death march\\" but also the seductive quality of say \\"Candy Shop\\". The production here is the high point of this album, and this track should be bumped in clubs and car stereos for the next few months, just because of the Dr's production. Again 50 is lyrically weak, but I do give him kudos for finding a chorus that perfectly mates with the Dre's beat.<br /><br />\\"Gatman and Robbin\\" is an interesting track produced by Eminem and featuring Eminem. It is an interesting concept that is further propelled by Eminem's super hero like production. 50 shines here, rapping over the guitar and even outshining Eminem (for once in his career).<br /><br />Scott Storch provides most of the hottest instrumentals on the album. He begans with the seductive \\"Candy Shop\\", featuring his trademark Egyptian style music. Fellow G-Unit female Olivia is featured on this track and her sexy voice adds even more filthy quality to the already X-rated chorus. 50 raps with in a low, perverted tone, and spits even more perverted lyrics. Storch's beat in this one is classic, a fine example of the stellar club production found on this record.<br /><br />Storch pops up again on the track entitled \\"Just A Lil Bit\\". Just like \\"Candy Shop\\", this is a sex fueled song with an Egyptian inspired beat. 50's perverted low voice is back AGAIN, with more filth spewing from his mouth. All lyrics of the song are luckily drowned in Storch's drunk instrumental, even adding an Egypitan like instrument in the last 60 seconds. Another example of delicious club vibe, Storch certainly delivers on this song when 50s does not.<br /><br />If there has to be low point on the album, it would certainly be \\"My Toy Soldiers\\". The beat is absolutely horrible, the worst I have ever heard from Eminem behind the boards. Buzzing synthesizers and annoying whistles over a Tony Yayo guest verse is amazingly HORRIBLE. Yayo's verse is completely garbage, cementing his place as the worst G-Unit member. 50 here is okay, gaining a little more hardcore edge than on the previous tracks.<br /><br />If you havent heard the hype behind Piggy Bank, let me illustrate it for you. 50 comes out blasting away at fellow New York MC's such as Shyne, Fat Joe, Nas & Jadakiss over a stuttering Needlz backdrop. I myself, find 50 to be a little crazy, challenging such lyrical powerhouses as Nas and Jadakiss. 50 is alright lyrically, but these 2 MC's in particular are especially talented at what they do. All this can be percieved as a machine for selling records (as Jadakiss views it), probably an influential track that made this album move 1.2 million units in its first week.<br /><br />These are just the main tracks you as an Amazon shopper should know about. 50 Cent managed to squeeze 21 full length tracks onthis album, including a must hear remix to the crossover hit \\"Hate It Or Love It\\". 50 Cent here is nothing special, but certainly not bad. Like I said before, this album has some SPECTACULAR club beats, ready for the dance floor. Add multi-platinum recording artist 50 cent to the mix, how could you go wrong? Pick your copy up today.l length tracks on this album, including a must hear remix to the crossover hit \\"Hate It Or Love It\\". 50 Cent here is nothing special, but certainly not bad.

B00003CXSP|3.0|The \\"final\\" Lector movie focuses on Hannible living in Italy, where a greedy cop recognizes him and attempts to collect the reward for his capture. Watching this scenario play out, I got the impression I was supposed to sympathize with Hannibal Lector, not with the people trying to trap him. I would think that felons on the FBI's 10 most wanted list would be more recognizable in public, but Lector has no problem going through airport customs or mingling with Italian police. Julianne Moore's version of the Starling character was okay, but lacked the \\"scared rabbit\\" element Jodie Foster used so effectively in \\"Silence\\". Overall, this movie lacks the suspense and the tight scripting that made the first two stories to captivating.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I bought this CD last year with a bunch of other CD's and had high expectations from this band because of all the rave reviews. I HATED this CD the first time I listened to it; it grated on my ears and made no sense at all. However for some reason I gave it more listens and somehow heard it with a new attitude; I began to \\"understand\\" it. Deloused is certainly an acquired taste, so don't be put off by your first listen. It makes more sense with every time you listen to it. You then discover the complexities, cohesion (sort of), and musical creativity this album provides. This disc should be heard as a whole because it is a high-octane emotional ride. It can get very intense. People sulk away from Deloused because of the voice (even though it's awesome, it harmonizes perfectly with the music), white noise (I think it is adequate, it takes off pressure from the intensity of the music), or insane sounds. However they need to understand how everything needs to be merged into one to work; it must be FELT. And, people, just because TMV are compared to Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin or Santana doesn't mean they are exact copies. I can definitely see progressive and salsa influences (among other genres), but together they form a style of their own. <br />   Each song is very unique and only a close analysis will tell the qualities that differentiates a song from another. Most songs have driving, dynamic segments mixed with smooth, harmonious segments and they work together wonderfully. TMV show they can do much, much more than create linear songs. To further support my last statement, they provide a ballad, \\"Televators\\", which has an exquisite melody and beauty. \\"Drunkship of Lanterns\\" features vigorous percussions and delayed guitar riffs, which create an untamed, wild setting, just like a jungle and the song just keeps building up. \\"Roulette Dares\\" has an ending with a jazzy, mellow feel to it, very melodic. \\"Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt\\" has a mind-blowing bridge- this is wherebeautiful harmony reaches its pinnacle. <br />  On a closing note, I should remind you that, if you approach this album with an open mind and willingness to expand your musical taste, you'll be in for a rewarding experience. People that burn this CD after their first listen are really missing out on some excellent music and the musical genius of TMV.
B0002F7I9Y|1.0|this could have been an excellent album, considering the talent involved. instead it's an album with no energy whatsoever, and shmaltzy tunes galore. of course it won a ton of grammy's, but we all know the grammys are a joke anyway. very sad to see this as his swan song, when most of his material was filled with soulful energy, and fierce originality. this plays as though it was put together by a muzac executive, with no feeling for the music whatsoever. very disappointing.
B0007O38F8|1.0|I think this album exposes 50 as being a phony and shows he doesn't belong among the elite in the hip hop game. 50's lyrical ability doesn't sell, in fact 50 has the weakest flow of anyone in G-Unit. 50's image sells, he sells record because he's a former drug dealer who's been shot 5 times. I've never heard a flow by 50 that left me in awe and \\"Piggy Bank\\" is the absolute worst diss song I've ever heard. \\"Piggy Bank\\" doesn't belong in the same breath as \\"Ether,\\" \\"Takeover,\\" \\"Hit Em' Up,\\" etc. After hearing \\"Piggy Bank\\", I actually asked myself if Fat Joe, Jada, and Nas were actually supposed to get pissed about that song? The beats on this album are average at best and 50 should be on his knees blowing Dre for making his first album so good. Someone said if you wanted a good album, check out The Documentary by The Game. The Game's cd is hot, Dre is all over it and The Game has the lyrical ability to rap about something besides gun shots. <br />One more thing is that someone needs to tell 50 he's no 2pac.

B0007CNXUK|5.0|GothamGirl and another reviewer on here who gave low ratings seem to miss the point of the movie.<br /><br />To the reviewer who gave a rating of 1 Star, of course there aren't going to be any real pirates in this or a shot gun blast to the chest. This movie has to do with how playwright J.M. Barrie came up with the idea for writing Peter Pan. So it makes perfect sense that there would be kids and grown-ups dressed up as pirates and such in this movie. If you were going into this movie thinking it would be like Depp's last movie Pirate of the Carribean, than you probably shouldn't have gone to see this.<br /><br />To GothamGirl, yes, the movie can be a bit slow but personally I wouldn't have preferred it any other way than to have the movie focus on Barrie and his wife. It's the estrangement between him and his wife that causes him to form this frienship with four boys and their widow mother. And actually, I felt the movie did a wonderful job of balancing the focus between Barrie and his wife as well as with Winslet's character and her family of four boys.<br /><br />Now on to the movie, lol. First off definitely gotta say that I loved this movie and will be adding it to my DVD library when it comes out to DVD on March 22. The tear jerkers come more towards the end, but it's still a very touching movie and certainly filled with a lot of magic, imagination and wonder. Depp as always does a great job and I become more and more a fan of his with each movie I see (looking forward to the Burton movie of Charlie And The Chocolate Factory that he's doing and the sequel to Pirates Of The Carribean). Depp's Scottish accent was perfect (at first I thought the accent was Irish since I hadn't realized that Barrie is originally Scottish). Freddy Sizemore is incredible as a boy who demands to grow up as quickly as possible so as not to feel the pain that children feel when losing a loved one like a parent(s). Sizemore was just incredibly talented in this film, which leads me to believe we can expect more great things from him as he gets older not too mention seeing more of his talent as Charlie Bucket in Tim Burton's version of Charlie And The Chocolate Factory.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this movie for the entire family to watch, but be sure to have some tissues ready.me to believe we can expect more great things from him as he gets older not too mention seeing more of his talent as Charlie Bucket in Tim Burton's version of Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. <br /> <br />I definitely recommend this movie for the entire family to watch, but be sure to have some tissues ready.
B00005JNEW|4.0|...if it hadn't pulled its punches: I pretty much have to agree with the review in Salon.com (which you can find at rottentomatoes.com), this film is brilliantly shot and acted, but the director cops out halfway through and turns it into just another sports-as-character-formation cliche.<br /><br />The first half of the film touches on some uncomfortable truths about high school (and collegiate) football: that too many people, esp. in tiny backwater towns where nothing else ever happens, live vicariously through them and therefore place an ungodly and uhealthy amount of pressure on the kids playing it.  That these types of towns and schools have their priorities ass-backwards when they funnel all of their resources into their sports programs and exorbitant stadiums rather than education, which shortchanges the other 95% of the students who DON'T play sports.  That these teenage gladiators get put on a social pedestal but often end up getting the short end of the stick because they are given a free ride through school and therefore get very little real education, i.e. very little real-life job prospects if they fail (as 99% do) to make it into the NFL.  The clincher is the ending credits when there are little blurbs about what each player ended up doing later in life---the sensational star running back (aptly nicknamed \\"Boobie\\") is vaguely listed as \\"now living in Somesuch Small Town in Texas with his two kids\\" instead of describing what sort of menial job he likely ended up with whereas all his other teammates' blurbs do include their job descriptions.<br /><br />However, if you can detach yourself from those painfully obvious realities and evasions, this is still a very entertaining film, better than any other football film I can remember.<br /><br />This film could've been a scathing and courageous indictment of the cult of spectator sports; instead it settles on being just another validation of that toxic subculture.
B00003CXXP|4.0|This movie is underrated. Let me say that. Even I underrated it when it first came out. I thought the ending was just Spielburg trying to force a happy ending onto a movie that didn't need one. This kind of ruined the rest of the movie for me. But, upon rewatching it the other day, I realize that the ending fit with the rest of the movie. I'll avoid spoilers here, so I can't really say much more. <br /> <br />The one real problem with the movie is that, while already a pretty dark movie, especially considering Spielberg directed it, it should have been a bit darker. I don't know exactly what it is that seems too 'friendly' about it, but it is. Spielberg, apparently, couldn't bring himself to make this movie as mean as it needed to be. Gigolo Joe should've been more of a con man, I think. But Jude Law was in fine form in his performance. I think he'll end up considered one of our era's finest actors. <br /> <br />Really, you should give this movie another chance. It's one of Spielberg's better movies, I think.
0064407667|5.0|A Series of Unfortunate Events <br />\\"The Bad Beginning\\" <br /> <br /> <br />\\"If you are interested in stories with happy endings, you would be better off reading some other book.\\"  This is the first sentence in the story.  Immediately, I was drawn into the book.  In this book, not only is there no happy ending, there is no happy beginning and very few happy things in the middle. So, how do I convince you that not only will you love this book, but you won't be able to put it down?  Well, here it goes. <br /> <br />The Bad Beginning is about three children, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire.  Although these children were intelligent, charming and attractive, they were extremely unlucky and most everything that happened to them was cursed with misfortune, misery and despair.  One day while at the beach, the children received some very bad news.  They were told by Mr. Poe, a friend of the family that their parents had \\"perished\\" in a terrible fire.  The fire also destroyed their entire house and all of their possessions.   <br /> <br />Count Olaf, their guardian, is constantly trying everything in his power to get his hands on the fortune that was left to them by their parents.  No matter how Count Olaf tried to make them feel defeated, they stayed unified and strong.  The message that spoke to me was that even when you are in a difficult situation or under a lot of pressure, you should still stand up for what you believe.   <br /> <br />I liked this book a lot because there never was a dull moment.  The Count was obsessed with trying to get their money and he never stopped.  It was like a wild roller coaster ride, full of loops and big drops.  As soon as the children managed to escape one plot, they would find themselves right smack in the middle of yet another. <br /> <br />If you want a book to leave you feeling like you just rode the Goliath at Magic Mountain, this is the book for you.  Once you pick it up, you won't be able to put it down until the very end.  This book will go with you to brush your teeth, eat breakfast, go to the bathroom and then ride on the bus with you to school, never leaving your hands.  Enjoy the ride! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />J Wright <br />
B00000DG1R|5.0|Duran Duran is a band of epic proportions. For their pioneering video craftsmanship, their trailblazing of the New Romantic subgenre, their fururistic fashion sense, the Fab Five deserve the lifetime achievement award they recently received. <br /> <br />\\"Greatest\\" is a fantastic compliation of their hits, from \\"Planet Earth\\" to \\"Electric Barbarella\\". The songs sound fantastic (better, in several cases, than on their original releases), and the collection boasts a robust repretoire of New Wave gems (I admit bias - my favorite Duran tune, \\"I Don't Want Your Love\\", appears). About the only off-note is the inclusion of the vapid \\"Serious\\": there are at least four better songs on \\"Liberty\\", the album from which \\"Serious\\" is taken. <br /> <br />Perhaps Capitol should have replaced \\"Serious\\" with \\"White Lines\\", the superb remake from \\"Thank You\\", Duran's album of cover tunes.  <br /> <br />But that is a very small nit-pick. Another is that \\"Greatest\\" cannot be the definitive Duran Duran compilation - they have had two albums since, the quirky \\"Pop Trash\\" and the incredible \\"Astronaut\\", ensuring at least one more \\"best of\\" album ere the end. <br /> <br />But \\"Greatest\\", like \\"Decade\\" before it, is well worth the purchase price.

He pulls together clear and compelling explanations of how events unfolded (and are still unfolding) in various parts of the world.  <br />The lesson is clear. Those societies that can adapt their ways of life to be in line with the potentials of their environment last while those societies that abuse their resources ultimate commit suicide, and so fail. Now, for the first time in human history, modern technology, global interdependence and international cooperation have provided us with the means and opportunity to judiciously use our resource and prevent their depletion not only from a small scale, but from a global scale as well. It is only by harnessing this new knowledge to sustain our planet, that we shall avoid the fate of self-destruction, like several great societies before us.

B000002MFE|5.0|Eric Clapton has been my favorite guitarist since I heard the opening riff to \\"Layla\\" a while back. This 1991 recording takes his most emotional work and reworks it into a jazzy piece of remembrance over love lost rather than love desired. The unplugged version of \\"Layla\\" is simply an amazing song, quite nearly as good as the original. The other tracks on this album are equally amazing. From the catchy instrumental opener \\"Signe\\" to the upbeat closer \\"Rollin' and Tumblin',\\" this album is truly a work of art. Clapton's smooth, laid-back vocals match his stellar acoustic work throughout the album. The best songs on Unplugged are the covers of Derek and the Dominoes' \\"Layla\\" and \\"Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out,\\" and the very emotional \\"Tears In Heaven,\\" written after the death of Clapton's 4 year-old son Conor. Every track is strong, and you can tell that Clapton really enjoys playing live, as do his bandmates(as evidenced by the joking and laughter at the beginning of \\"Alberta\\" and after the interesting kazoo solo in \\"San Francisco Bay Blues\\").  <br /> <br />BEST SONGS: \\"Layla,\\" \\"Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out,\\" \\"Tears In Heaven\\" <br /> <br />SONGS TO SKIP: None <br /> <br />Overall, this album is a masterpiece, among Clapton's best and most emotional work. A must-have for any fan of music! <br />

B000002UTY|5.0|I remember sitting in an old Volkswagen Beetle, the smell of gas from the leaky tank, the fog out the window. A perfect night to trip though there were no drugs involved. It was 1968 I think and the setting was just off Sierra Highway in Saugus, California. It was about ten at night on a Friday and I was spending the night with my band mates. Our bass player found this AOR FM station and turned it on to see what was there. That is where we heard Maiden of the Cancer Moon segueing into Cavalry. Wow! What a trip! An unforgettable experience that still gives me flashbacks. The next week I rushed out to find that album. It is their best, hands down. I bought more of their albums but they just could not stand up to this one. It was especially freaky when they ended the album with a Roy Rogers tune! They just don't make em' like they used to.

He  also  has  a  good  mix  of  club  records  like  'Candy  Shop'  and  'Just  A  Lil  Bit', and  more  serious  tracks  like  'A  Baltimore  Love  Thing'. The  only  downfall  of  The  Massacre, in  my  opinion, is  the   production. With  high  profile  producers  such  as  Scott  Storch, Eminem, Dr. Dre, and  SHA  MONEY  XL, I  was  expecting  every  song  to  have  a  sic  beat  behind  it, which  is  not  the  case.

B0006J28BO|5.0|All of Studio Ghibli's films are wonderful and The Cat Returns proves this. The story is a wonderfully magical tale of finding oneself (I won't go into details, but if you wish to know more read the product summary). All of the characters are well developed and the main character has a believable personality. The English dub is perfect (Disney always seems to do a good job when it comes to dubbing) and the artwork is so beautiful you won't be able to tear your eyes away from the screen. Children and adults alike will enjoy this soon to be timeless classic. <br /> <br />The DVD itself comes with nice extras like behind the microphone with the English cast, the making of The Cat Returns, TV Trailers and complete storyboards along with some Disney sneak peaks.  <br /> <br />All in all, this movie is great buy and an excellent addition to anyone's DVD collection. (If your wondering why some people gave this movie a bad or average rating its probably because they are anime freak and are bias towards Studio Ghibli productions that are not directed by Hayao Miyazaki)   <br />
B00062IVKI|5.0|Martin Scorcese's NEW YORK, NEW YORK is a film that explores realism through a most unlikely medium--a homage to the movie musicals of the 1950s, particularly the more dark and dramatic musicals, such as Judy Garland's A STAR IS BORN and Doris Day's LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME.   <br /> <br />To many people 1977 does not seem like so very long ago, but to younger viewers and film enthusiasts who were not around then to see the movies firsthand, it can be a very daunting experience trying to hunt down obscure films from that time. I searched for about five years to find a decent copy of NEW YORK, NEW YORK, but was unlucky until finally it was released on DVD this year.  I must say, along with THE DAY OF THE LOCUST, it was a very welcome release!   <br /> <br />I am intrigued by many of the films of the 1970s and early 1980s that sought to explore earlier, more glamorous decades. Along with THE DAY OF THE LOCUST and FRANCES (1982), NEW YORK, NEW YORK is especially important for, if nothing else, a rare glimpse of Liza Minnelli at the peak of her beauty and talent. The film is an astounding showcase for her to emote, sing, and display incredible star quality at every turn. By the the time the great finale rolls around, with the theme song \\"New York, New York\\" sung with such bravado, it's easy to see what made Liza so famous.  For many younger viewers, such as myself, who weren't around at the time, what made Liza famous (besides CABARET) is not readily apparent.   <br /> <br />Finally, I will discuss the quality of the film, which is one of the truly great musicals.  NEW YORK, NEW YORK is misunderstood primarily because it is so ambitious. For the sensitive viewer, who has great attention to significant details, the film is not flawed.  The first time I watched it I considered it incredibly flawed, but the second time everything clicked for me. The idea behind the film was the put real life situations (including acting improvisation, etc.) into an artificial setting--in this case, a glitzy New York City during the big band era of the 1940s.  The production is astounding at all levels. Nightclubs and streets and locations are recreated as if you are walking into the past, except better--this is the glamorous past created by the movies that didn't necessarily exist, but fuelled so many dreams.  New York City was certainly movie heaven.  The glittering skyline alone could make you dream of something better, and that's really what this movie is about. It's about wanting a happy ending, when it doesn't really exist. <br /> <br />For the two main characters, played so brilliantly by Robert Deniro and Liza Minnelli, that happy ending can't exist. Thus the magnificent lyric from the \\"Happy Endings\\" musical number that sums it all up: \\"Happy endings are only for the stars, not in the stars for me.\\"  And so we know that NEW YORK, NEW YORK can't end happily like so many musicals that came before, because this is the 1970s, and real life doesn't always end happy.   <br /> <br />And real people do not always possess sympathetic qualities that win us over, or make us love them in the end.  Robert Deniro's character is like many people we may have known in life, who we didn't like, and the movie doesn't bother trying to make us love him.  Again, in real life, some people we just can't love.  The main problem many people have with the film is their dislike of Robert Deniro's character, but in certain scenes he is touching, such as when he meets Liza in the hospital and says he doesn't want to see his son, because he is so genuine. We may not like him, but he is a genuine character. <br /> <br />There are other examples that may not be so obvious, of the realism the producers were trying to achieve: characters regularly flub their lines, people trip over chairs and bump into each other, and wine glasses are lifted with napkins stuck to the bottom. It's all so carefully constructed, and ultimately masterful.   <br /> <br />The colors are reminiscent of ASTAR IS BORN, Liza Minnelli reminds one of Judy Garland, but NEW YORK, NEW YORK belongs to Martin Scorsese. It is a misunderstood, but enduring, triumph.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B0006GAOBI|2.0|I waited a long time to see this movie.  I heard so many rave reviews about this film, and I searched different video stores in hopes of actually finding it.  When I heard that a director's cut was coming out, I finally felt that it was my chance to see it. <br /> <br />Suffice to say, upon actually viewing the film, I was not that impressed.  It was so incoherent that I was praying it would finish after the first hour.  Donnie Darko could have worked better as a short film, but instead we are treated to an inflated, nonsensical plot, physic/psychological/theological mumbo-jumbo, and one-dimensional supporting characters.  Some of the actors do give fine performances, but it seems like they belong in different films (i.e. Drew Barrymore as the sarcastic English teacher).  We are supposed to believe in the mysterious and profound whenever somebody gives a zombified stare (which Gyllenhaal seems to have throughout the movie; the same goes with Mary McDonnell).  I'm so glad it's not sequel material.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Yes, Reign in Blood is my favorite Slayer album. No, I'm not simply jumping on the bandwagon; I own all of their albums and managed to track down all of their unreleased songs. Reign in Blood has a certain feel that none of their previous nor future albums would be able to capture. The original recording clocked under 30 minutes. If not one of the heaviest and well-produced metal albums of all time, that fact alone can maintain it as the fastest. The furious assault and battery of \\"Angel of Death\\" opens the cd, \\"Jesus Saves\\" and \\"Criminally Insane\\" sweeten the deal, and the combined fury of \\"Postmortem\\" and the eponymous \\"Raining Blood\\" has potential to leave fans in a literal stupor, even after the twentieth listen(the expanded version feature an impressive re-rendition of \\"Aggressive Perfector\\" and a creepy remix of \\"Criminally Insane\\"). Besides its tremendous influence, the album has infinite replay value for fans of the genre. Even if you're not into speed metal, I still need to recommend Reign in Blood. It may just convert you.
B0007O38F8|4.0|First, the used cd stores won't even buy this back garbage is just that.  I went to a few used record stores and could only find it new. <br /> <br />Anyway, I got as tired as In Da Club as anybody, but I'd be willing to wager any fan will find at least eight tracks that you'll listen to repeatedly.  I actually like it as much, if not more than Get Rich and if/when it gets stolen I'll re-buy it. <br /> <br />Lastly, 50 bashing is popular because certain individuals/groups have a problem with how urban he and his music are so they childishly/trollingly try to hide it by saying he's untalented.  Why not just cut and paste someone else's review?  Can't come up with your own, specific insults?   <br /> <br />Their are about a million examples on the get rich reviews page which you should never ever waste your time reading.  Be like a duck.   <br />
B000001C6M|4.0|Although Slayer would later transcend the boundaries of typical metal and become the epitomization of speed metal, they received their start as a blazingly raw thrash band. Similar in sound to Judas Priest and similar in pure energy to Metallica(Kill 'em All), Show no Mercy exhibits a sound that would never be heard again by Slayer or by any other thrash band of the decade. The lead work is brilliant, the vocals are dynamic, and the lyrics are a prime example of the band's Satanesque gimmick. I wish that the rating system would allow for a 4.5 star rating, because that is what I would officially give this album. Songs like \\"Die by the Sword\\" and \\"Crionics\\" are powerful while \\"The Antichrist\\" and \\"The Final Command\\" are blazing fast. The album is well rounded and welldone. It can't be recommended for everyone; opinions are relative, but any fan of Slayer or thrash metal in general will find this one to be worth hours of listening.
B00006AUIG|5.0|I don't want to call this a horror movie. It is not particularly frightening.  I don't want to call it a thriller, because it moves at a very slow and steady pace.  I WOULD like to call it a suspense film, because from start to finish, there is a certain tension that you may not be able to put your finger on, but will haunt you even as the closing credits begin to roll. <br />  Session 9 is the story of an asbestos cleaning crew, working to clean out Danvers Insane Asylum (a real location, beautifully used in the film) within a week, an extremely difficult deadline given the size and scope of the job.  Their motivation is a substantial bonus if they meet their deadline. <br />  But tensions start to rise among the members of the crew...  Something about the building perhaps that seems to be bringing it out in them.  And, as the movie churns forward, you will discover that some of the men have may be hiding something as well. <br />  Director Brad Anderson keeps a slow and steady pace throughout, only escalating the pace in the final thrilling minutes.  He uses his gorgeous location to great effect.  The exterior of the hospital is gorgeous in itself, and is captured with some great aerial shots, but the deteriorating interior, with dripping pipes, slick floors, and graffiti covered walls, is haunting and leaves a lasting impression.  The sound effects and music help drive the film, and never feel out of place.  Everything is captured on high-definition digital video, I believe, but seems fitting. <br />  The acting is phenomenal throughout, and the movie feels almost like a character study rather than a suspense film.  And although it is not scary necessarily, (the IDEA behind it is a bit frightening), the film often draws comparisons to Kubrick's The Shining, and the comparisons are fitting.  Both films use enormous, lonely, abandoned buildings to generate tension and bring out the worst in their characters, and use steadily sweeping cameras to great effect, and both films are divided in to days, using titles (\\"Monday\\") in similar fashion. <br />  The bottomline, then, is this: Session 9 is a terrific little suspense film.  If you are disappointed at first, I might suggest giving it another try.  For me, each viewing is more enjoyable than the last, and it was not until the second that I began to really appreciate it's genius.  Recommended.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|Excellent movie that reminds people to value the one they love.  Our society is so into the next best/better thing.  We even try to upgrade already satisfying relationships thinking there is someone better out there.  This movie shows the danger of risking the loss of someone you love for someone that you think may make you happier.  It shows how relationships evolve and change over time.
0679720200|4.0|The Stranger, written by Albert Camus, is a novel that focuses on the bizarre qualities of human behavior. Written for readers who enjoy books presented as out of the ordinary, the author fulfills his purpose by playing upon the absurd. I fully enjoyed this novel because of its unique, baffling quality, and recommend it for those in search of a truly perplexing read. <br /> Translated from French, The Stranger is about Meursault, a Frenchman much detached from society. The novel starts out with Meursault receiving word that his mother recently passed away. While seemingly a grievous time, he remains unaffected, stating, \\"Maman was buried now, I was going back to work, and that, really, nothing had changed\\" (24). From this point onward, the reader sees how Meursault is quite different from the rest of society. He finds no wrong in a friend beating a lover, and is even indifferent in his feelings toward another woman, noting, \\"She asked me if I wanted to marry her. I said it didn't make any difference to me and that we could if she wanted to\\" (41). This simple story quickly becomes intricate through Meursault's complex character. Eventually he finds himself on trial for murder. Although the average citizen would be fearful for his life, Meursault feels no apprehension, but rather interested in witnessing a real court proceeding. In fact, he is more questioned about the relationship with his mother than the actual murder, as his careless feelings come back to haunt him. <br /> This polished novel is truly reflective of the author's genius. The way Camus leaves the reader mystified in the end allows him to achieve his goal of unsettling confusion. The main character's qualities; indifference, detachment, and carelessness, highlight absurdity as the main premise of the novel. Camus leaves the reader with only one question unanswered: Why does Meursault act and feel the way he does? The question is up for speculation because Camus only tells of Meursalt's apathy towards life, and not of its origin. I believe the author left the question unanswered because it is unimportant to fully understand Meursault. This way, absurdity can remain supported through irrational behavior. <br /> Camus controls certain literary elements to strengthen his work. Aside from the main character, the author gives true personality to each of the other members in his story so as to define Meursault's apparent hazy qualities. The indecisive language he uses is key in developing the abstractness in Meursault's character. Short, choppy sentences help provide for confusion throughout the novel. Finally, apathy is the overall feeling that contributes most to the revolving theme of absurdity. These elements all molded together form the backbone to this vague and elusive account Camus has created. <br /> Altogether, The Stranger is a remarkable story that can be described as anything but normal. This curious depiction of indifference crosses the line between the strange and the downright absurd. Because it is unlike anything I have read I take immediate interest to the idea of viewing abstractness as a new norm. I praise Camus' somewhat lethargic depiction of apathy in society, and its effect on others. I recommend this novel to those with abstract ways of thinking, and interested in experiencing the truly abnormal. <br />
B000002G89|4.0|Although many are not fans of the latter day pop escapades of Eric Clapton, you'd be hard pressed to find those who don't respect his early work or, at very least, his talent. On 461 OCEAN BOULEVARD we hear a cool, lazy interpretation of the revered guitar hero. The mood is quite buoyant and breezy, often incorporating varied elements of blues, gospel, and reggae as well as a little twist of country into the fray.  <br /> <br />Again, Clapton shows-off his mastery of the guitar whether picking his signature blues licks or bringing his instrument to the point of weeping via his liquidy slide work. Strikingly beautiful songs such as \\"Let It Grow\\" and \\"Please Be With Me\\" are compelling in their own right, somewhat overshadowing the funky yet overplayed \\"I Shot The Sheriff.\\" And of course, there's still room for a little dirty groove and boogie on \\"Willie and The Hand Jive,\\" \\"I Can't Hold Out\\" and \\"Mainline Florida,\\" which nicely bookends this southern-tinged stroll. As fine a solo album as he would record, Clapton comfortably achieved a quiet majestic bliss on this easy going release.
0316168815|5.0|The lovely bones was one of the best books I have read this year. From the first page i was riveted by the main charaters chilling story. The main character, Susie salmoln, was murdered and narrates the story form her heaven. Her own private world where she is on the cover of each fashion magazine, and dogs dance at sunset in a field of flowers. Susie watches over her family as they try to cope with her murder. Susie also watches her murderer in some of the most chilling parts of the book. Though the subject matter is very serious, Sebold writes in a easy to read manner that is thoroughly entertaining. I know this book is very popular and it is for a good reason. This is a must read.
B000683VI4|5.0|The Notebook is one of those movies that you have to see at least once.  I read the book first and saw the movie afterwards.  Even though some things were changed in the movie, I thought that Rachel McAdams, Ryan Gosling, Gena Rolands and James Garner did a wonderful job portraying the young and old Allie and Noah.  This movie has some wonderful scenes in it like Allie and Noah dancing in the street and meeting at the carnival.  THis movie is a classic, and should be watched with someone you love. It is a true work of art and a testament to what true love can do.  Allie followed her heart even though she was engaged to someone else, and well I won't give away the ending!.  But if you're looking for a tear jerker movie, with passion and romance buy this one!.
0440539811|5.0|Other reviews address the content, significance, imagination etc.<br /><br />No one else has mentioned this yet, but I am most impressed with just the in-depth quality of the writing craft itself, once you get past some strange quirks, like the sudden jumps among different first- and third-person perspectives.<br /><br />Parts of it might read as if they are just \\"stream of consciousness\\", but they were certainly not all just streamed out  that way onto the page, without significant work ... when you step back, and look at the assembling/disassembling/re-assembling of so many intricate parts, into a twisted non-Euclidean curved pyramidal whole, the craft and work involved is quite impressive.<br /><br />Also having \\"been there\\" a few times, many years ago, I can say that their vivid verbal portrayals, of some extremely emotional psychedelic hallucinogenic schizoid states, are right on.<br /><br /> (ignoring the actual content of the specific trip, I mean, just focusing on the verbal portrayal of the emotional state, it reads like something out of my own long-ago experiences, except that they are much better writers than I could hope to be, they actually managed to get it written down in words, in a reasonably effective way!)<br /><br />Plus, so many of the characters etc. are familiar from my youth, it is a huge nostalgia trip for me too, a nice ride through familiar old stomping grounds of my youth. That is, back around then, circa 1972, I was a 12-year old pre-pubescent H.P.Lovecraft freak, Abbie Hoffman freak, science fiction freak, etc., had a crazy mother totally into Atlantis and all that fernando POO, and at the same time also had friends in the neighborhood, who were into Aleister Crowley, Anton LaVey Satanism, etc. Consequently I knew a lot more about the Satanic Bible, for instance, than I ever did about any of the Christian/Jewish mis-translations.<br /><br />So, it's like, the story of my tribe, it's like I could have been a very minor character, in the book. And there are a lot of us wandering around, still dazed & confused out here somewhere at least in the back of our minds .... so I see, this book is for US.<br /><br />This is a book I SHOULD have read, back then when it was new.

B0007Y08PQ|5.0|Star Trek: Insurrection personifies what Star Trek is all about.  Gene Roddenberry would be very proud of this film.  Insurrection is filled with a great deal of fun and action.  This film is filled with great character moments (the best for the TNG films), music & spectacular special effects.      The special features provided go in-depth on how the film evolved from script to screen.  Several features go into the art and special effects of Insurrection and provide a better look at how they were accomplished.     The specs for this DVD are great.  But the best part are the seven deleted scenes including the Alternate Ending.  This is a must have for any Star Trek fan!!!

B0007O38F8|5.0|This CD is by far one of the best I ve herd this year. Every track is good in there own ways, the first 5 songs on the album were tight as hell and it really made the album stand out. The one song that I think was my favorite was \\"A Baltimore Love Thing\\" not that many rappers can take such a hard hitting topic and make it into a song. 50 cent is on the way to being one of the best rappers next to pac, biggie, jigga, dre, eminem: <br /> <br />Songs recommended that you listen to: <br /> <br />In my Hood    <br />Get in My car <br />This is 50     <br />Im suppose to die tonight <br />Piggy bank    <br />Candy shop  <br />Outta control            <br />A Baltimore Love thing <br />Disco Inferno    <br />Build you up <br />Just a little bit <br />So Amazing <br />Hate it or love it (remix) <br /> <br />Many people right now are gunna target 50 Cent or criticize him in the media because of how he raps and his issues with other rappers and even The Game (member of G-unit) but THE GAME should realize that he was on the verge of getting cut from Interscope records and 50 helps launch his career. On \\"The documentary\\" the songs that 50 cent makes an appearance on are the most listen to by most people so instead of hating on 50 he should appreciate him.   <br /> <br />\\"The massacre\\" is just a step in 50 cent career, if he didn't get your attention on this one, he will probably get you the next time, and if you loved this album then its most defiantly a collectors item as well as all solo albums from G-Unit. <br /> <br />

0671027344|5.0|If you're a teenager, or even a young adult, looking for a story that will keep your interest and that relates to your life, then the Perks of Being a Wallflower is the book for you.  Author Steven Chbosky tells the story of Charlie, a teenager, and his journey through his first year of high school.  On his journey through this new world, he meets new friends, both young and old, that take him on an extraordinary journey through this new chapter in his life.  Realistic situations concerning dating, drugs, sex, and everyday tasks are made interesting through Charlie's perspective, which is given to you through descriptive and intimate letters written by Charlie himself.  The experiences that Charlie deals with are identical to the same difficulties that the majority of teens deal with today.  I often found myself able to easily relate to Charlie's life, and at times I felt like I was reading about my own.  Although at first it is difficult to see where the book is leading to, it is worth reading through the first opening pages.  By the end of the story, you feel as if Charlie is real and a friend of your own.  His opinions and descriptions capture the exact emotions that any teenager feels at some time, along with opening up doors to a new perspective of varying situations.  I found myself wishing that the letters and his story would never end as I finished the book, and even now I still wonder how his life would have turned out if the story continued on.

0688163173|3.0|The anachronisms were what turned me off in this story.  Supposedly set in 1954 (year I graduated from college), I saw so many things that never were 1954ish that suspicions came immediately.  I know some did, but was the F-word used in every other conversation in 1954?  Don't think so.  References to electronic items the same, and some of the terminology about psychiatric procedures just didn't exist then.  Seems to me the ending was clear enough, although only suggested.
0385510454|5.0|..or at least the best one since The Firm. If you have enjoyed Grisham's previous work at all, then you won't want to miss The Broker.<br /><br />Joel Backman is a scheming lawyer/lobbyist whose greed lands him in the middle of an international arms deal that goes awry. Backman is thrown in prison for treason, while most of his co-conspirators are murdered by irate foreign governments. Midway through his sentence, Backman is unexpectedly pardoned by an outgoing President. Literally overnight, he is whisked from federal prison to a witness protection program in Italy.<br /><br />Backman spends his next few months learning Italian, budgeting his Euros, and trying to adjust to his new life. He grows increasingly suspicious of his handlers; and it becomes apparent that his parole is actually a death sentence. The CIA wants to see which foreign government will kill Backman, and thereby reveal its involvement in the weapons deal. The reader knows that this is coming before Backman does, and the resulting sense of tension makes The Broker a compulsive page-turner.<br /><br />This book is also full of subplots that add to the deeper fabric of the story. The reader explores Backman's relationship with his estranged son, and his attempts to win over an aloof romantic interest in Italy. The main character's efforts to learn Italian will also be appreciated by anyone who has ever struggled with a new language.<br /><br />The Broker follows a familiar Grisham formula: an ambitious lawyer crosses paths with dangerous characters who become intent on killing him. A battle of wits and a life-or-death chase ensue. While this may be a formula by now, it is a formula that Grisham excels at; and the variety and twists in this one make for a tremendously compelling read.
6304083769|4.0|Ghost In The Shell was The Martix with different charcters before the Martrix came out.  The movie was known for it's physcologic aspects even over actions squences.  This film caters for the nerd population so in buying it you most likly are one.  As that most people have to watch the film a few times before understanding it.  I give this 4 stars only because it's a classic but not a true classic like Fist Of The Northstar.  The story line is not that great.  This and Armitage were the exact same concept as the matrix so I hope no one ever calls the matrix inovative.  I would suggest this to anyone who likes war or miltary movies(or if you love the Matrix(American Film)I hate that movie!).
B00005JNEI|5.0|Fahrenheit 9/11 is movie that I have been wanting to see and I am glad that I did. Many people believe that Michael Moore is slanted, but much of is facts out for people to be able to discover for themselves. Myself, I never realized that recruiters will target people in poorer areas to join up. I think that Fahrenheit 9/11 is a movie that makes the viewers think not about the war but our whole system and if it is really fair and equal for every one.
B000001DWB|3.0|This album I would say is average maybe a little above.  I'd say it has two down falls lyrics and variety.  All the songs kinda sound the same and are about the same thing.  Basically the singer tries to hard to be \\"Metal\\".  I'd say that if your looking for something very simular go for Skid Row or Motley Crue who do sound much like this band.  The worst idea of all was however to cover the song \\"Cats In The Cradle\\".  Heres why, the song is basically about a son and father who don't have enough time for each other.  When the son is young he wants to spend time with his dad but he is too busy and when the dad gets older he wants to spend time with his son but he's too busy.  Than to the to singing \\"And the cats in the cradle and the sliver spoon little jimmy... and the man on the moon\\" what is that supposed to mean.  On the postive even though the songs sound a lot alike the instrumentals and singing got a different sound from typical metal.  Plus with a name like that you'd think they would just be extremely terrible which they are not.  In the end if you want a real metal cd stay away but if you like poppy music you may like this.
0446677450|5.0|(...)    I recommend this book to many people all the time... in fact, I never see my own copy because I'm always lending it out.  However when I do lend it, it always comes with a warning because like it or not, this book aggressively gets straight to the point, and doesn't sugar coat anything.    There are a few times when very blunt statements are made that really make you want to blurt out \\"that's just mean,\\" but it's always a true statement. The bluntness is usually there to get you to open your eyes and take something they're talking about a little more seriously than you normally would. For example, a statement something like: \\"If you're living outside your means, you are thinking like a poor person -most middle class people think like a poor person and only ensure that they will one day be poor.\\" That's pretty serious words. But then the author will go on to explain why they've made such a bold and blunt statement. Although the bluntness is a little unsettling; I kept finding myself agreeing with the reasoning behind the statement. Then you find that the entire chapter can be summed up by the original blunt statement and you can easily remind yourself \\"Don't think like a poor person,\\" and recall the whole chapter.     I think this book was aggressive at getting its point across, and its point was worth listening to. If you can be open minded enough to listen to it, I'm sure you'll take at least one idea away with you.    I've read this book 3 times an plan on reading it again.  I think everyone should read this book.      (...)
B000000I02|5.0|Typically silly lyrics bouncing merrily on marvelous melodies courtesy of Richard Sinclair backed by astonishing musicianship from Dave Stewart, Phil Miller and Pip Pyle. What's not to love? <br />Plus the whole album is based on a single tune, graciously printed on the cover. When Robert Wyatt reprises that homerton theme on Calyx and when it appears in Stewart's noodling it makes the entire project a complete whole. Pretty cool, really.
0792841344|2.0|I'm a horror movie fan, and I can certainly appreciate horror movies of the late 70's/early 80's.  Halloween, for example, is brilliant.  The Exorcist, in my opinion, will dominate its genre eternally.  Phantasm, however, falls flat nearly every way it turns.  This movie is uneventful, riddled with bad acting, and accompanied by a very dated, cheesy soundtrack.  I kept waiting for the big \\"ah hah\\" moment...the moment where I could walk away feeling good about how I just spent the last 88 minutes of my life.  That moment never came.  I've read reviews the label Angus Scrimm's portrayal of \\"the Tall Man\\" as wonderful.  I don't get it.  What was so great about a lanky old guy who walks funny?  I give it two stars only because the scene with the silver ball is halfway decent.  Otherwise, I'd only give it one.  Save your time and money with this one...it's a waste of both.
B000089RVX|3.0|Well this is a fairly decent corporate band and I admit, when I bought this CD years ago I kinda liked it. Since then I've discovered bands like Nightwish and Lacuna Coil. If you love operatic female leads then you should try the 2 aforementioned bands. Heed this people, Evanescence is Nu-metal band using simple riffs that take little talent to accomplish. All I have to say is prepare for the power of hardcore and metalcore and the resurgence of real metal. For this band to be called metal is a disgrace.

B00006JDU9|5.0|This movie isn't a masterpiece, but it's definately a watchable beginning to the Star Wars Saga. <br /> <br />The Storyline is pretty good, the effects get extensive sometimes, but I think they storyling did what it needed to do. <br /> <br />They needed to find Anakin. And it was done very well. <br /> <br />This movie doesn't come close to any of the original trilogy, but like I said before, It's a nice beginning.
0792165020|4.0|Three and a half, if only I could give that.  <br /> <br />Matt Damon is positively sinister; psychologically conflicted and troubled, yes, but also sinister. Jude Law is cavalier, mocking, and spoiled (he's a little too good at this kind of role). Smaller, supporting roles here create the backdrop for the story and how things unravel for Damon's Tom Ripley. Cate Blanchett plays the small role of Meredith, to whom Ripley has passed himself off as Law's Dickie Greenleaf. Philip Seymour Hoffman is excellent as the sarcastic, suspicious and smarmy Freddy who does not quite trust Ripley, as he insinuates himself into Greenleaf's comfortable lifestyle. Greenleaf is so deeply ingrained in his own hedonistic lifestyle and lack of concern for others that he uses Ripley and does not think to see Ripley as a predator using him. Nor does Greenleaf's needy, simpering fiance Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow) see Ripley as predatory at first.  <br /> <br />The film is tastefully done, full of suspense and psychological tautness. Anthony Minghella delivers another excellent story coupled with amazing cinematography (almost distracting from the story it is so beautiful).  <br />
0767903854|5.0|Bill Bryson may be the funniest travel writer alive, and by consensus of my entire family, this travelogue of his Australian voyages is one of his best.  I don't know if I've ever laughed as hard at a book as I did at this one, starting practically at page one and going all the way to the end -- to name one (slightly crude) example, the section on his recovery from jet lag, and what happens when he sleeps, left me literally clutching my sides from laughing.  However, this book isn't just funny; it's also \\"fun\\" and informative.  The man loves his subject (admittedly, Australia is easy to love) and does his homework, whether delving into curious bits of historical trivia or exploring the exotic critters that roam the Australian outback.  (Example: his story of the preposterous discovery of the proto-ant \\"Nothomyrmecia,\\" while cast in terms both humorous and colorful, checks out with some of the scientific literature I consulted.)  There are moments of hyperbole, of course (for example, in his descriptions of the outback's venomous denizens, from which you'd infer they can kill you in your tracks with just a malevolent glance), but that's to be expected; after all, this is a book of humor, not of science.   <br /> <br />Overall, a terrific read that we recommend without hesitation.  If you have any interest at all in Australia, buy this book, convulse over it for a while, and follow in Bryson's footsteps.
B0007VCZ50|5.0|Finally, those of us who have waited for the better part of a decade will have the great satisfaction of seeing and hearing one of the best inside-view videos on DVD.  This is a landmark video - a reality video before the genre took off- and a very telling effort that relates the drama that unfolds behind the curtain for one of the most influencial rock musicians of the last couple of decades.  An all-star line-up that features some of the jazz world's greatest young lions of the time:  Omar Hakim (drums), Kenny Kirkland (piano), Darryl Jones (bass) and the venerable Branford Marsalis (sax).  A truly stellar band playing some of the most progressive music of the time.  The cd features different versions of the songs from the video release, which, most people who have seen the video will agree, was one of the most heinous crimes in the history of soundtrack releases.  Be sure to check out the blazing solos in many of the songs; Kenny Kirkland's solo in the title track, Omar Hakim's drum solo - which seems to disrupt the fabric of time and space -  in \\"I Burn for You,\\" and Branford's smoldering-to-full-on-scorching solos throughout.

B000001FA4|4.0|With this album U2 became a mega-act, taking on arena rock and paving the way for The Joshua Tree and 'biggest band in the world' and 'rock's hottest ticket'.<br /><br />This is the first collaboration between the band and producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois.  The result is a departure from the Steve Lillywhite-produced sound and is much more experimental than anything they'd done.  With Eno on board, there was an emphasis on textures and the intro of keyboards and soundscapes.<br /><br />The album is kind of split between big songs and much more experimental work.  A Sort of Homecoming is the first track, with its rumbling percussion and fuzzy effects, a big departure from earlier albums.  Perhaps best known is the ultimate-rock-anthem Pride (in the Name of Love), with its massive guitar sound and massive hook.  Wire is a fast, frantic number that is atmospheric and even :;gasp:: angry.  The title track is anthemic as well, moody but hopeful in that U2-way.<br /><br />The album features about four or five experimental tracks that work to varying degrees.  4th of July is simply an instrumental, one of U2's few, and mostly an atmospheric piece recorded on the fly on...the 4th of July, I believe.  Nothing special, but sets the mood for the next track, Bad, which became a live staple, especially after the Live Aid performance in 1985.  Promenade is another atypical U2 song, a very somber song with quiet percussion and mysterious production, all courtesy of master of soundscapes and artistic knob-twiddling, Brian Eno.<br /><br />The most bizarre track by far is Elvis Presley and America, which apparently was mostly ad-libbed by Bono.  There are no lyrics in the liner notes (except for Sort of Homecoming) and it's not surprising.  It's doubtful if Bono can remember them, and some of them are downright incomprehensible.  The drumbeat is A Sort of Homecoming, but slowed down, and the whole song has a very bizarre and hypnotic feel.  One of the few U2 tracks never performed live, and a real mystery, period.  Oddly attractive, though.<br /><br />This was a big change for U2.  They would go on to work with all of their producers again over time, sometimes having each of them on one album for different songs (Eno, Lanois, Lillywhite, Flood, etc.)  The production has always been very important to U2 as a band, but the songs are good and they hold up on stage as well.  This is U2 at their moody, experimental, hopeful best.  Bono would try getting 'deeper' in his lyrics, to varying effects, but they were on their way to being a serious, if pretensious rock band trying to do something more than the pop-rock and cheese of the time.  And music is the better for it.ks never performed live, and a real mystery, period.  Oddly attractive, though. <br /> <br />This was a big change for U2.

B000001ELP|5.0|When I set out to review \\"Music From the Elder\\" by KISS, I was originally going to give it four stars. However, upon further listening and reflecting, I think this album merits a five star rating. \\"Music From the Elder\\" is a bold, unique, magnificent album. Panned upon its release, and a commercial flop, \\"Music From the Elder\\" remains controversial among KISS fans to this date. The story behind the making of this album, i.e., Ezrin's idea, Frehley opposed, huge flop, has been told numerous times in reviews; so I wont bore the reader with those details and will instead get right to the review.<br /><br />KISS's \\"Music from the Elder\\" is unlike any KISS album before or since. For starters, it is a concept album. The album is based on a short story written by Simmons. According to the liner notes, the story was about, according to Robert V. Conte, \\"a young boy's destiny to become a warrior battling evil that was threatening to destroy the universe.\\"<br /><br />Because \\"Music from the Elder\\" is a concept album, it's not like \\"ALIVE\\" or \\"KISS,\\" in the sense that you can listen to it just once and get into it instantly. This was KISS's stab at making art-rock. As others have pointed out, you need to listen to the entire album as a whole. Unlike most KISS albums, \\"Music From the Elder\\" does not have 12 clear-cut songs that are each potential singles. With \\"Elder,\\" the whole album flows together, as one coherent piece of music, with 11 acts. Each song is important to the final product. There aren't any filler songs on \\"Elder.\\"<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Fanfare,\\" an atmospheric chant and flows into \\"Just a Boy,\\" a semi-acoustic number which sets the mood and pace of the album. The album then flows into \\"Odyssey\\" a very Pink Floyd-ish number written by Tony Powers. \\"Odyssey\\" is a really cool, mid-tempo song, tinged with orchestration and piano. The next number \\"Only You\\" is a really dark Simmons song. It has a real infectious hook and could have been a single. \\"Under the Rose\\" is a really interesting song. It starts out as a majestic semi-acoustic balled but then a Benedictine-Monk-like chant chorus kicks in. The album then moves into \\"Dark Light,\\" the only song Ace Frehley penned for the album. This song is probably one of the more classic KISS sounding songs on the album. This makes sense as Frehley was against the idea of doing a concept album. While \\"Dark Light\\" keeps up the mood and pace of the album, it is also a little out-of-step with the Stanley/Simmon numbers. This is not at all a bad thing, as it gives the album a little spice.  Simmon's \\"A World Without Heroes,\\"  is really dark, beautiful balled. \\"The Oath,\\" the albums anthem, is a stright-ahead rocker. The bizarre \\"Mr. Blackwell\\" adds a dark, errie touch to the album. \\"Escape from the Island\\" is a cool instrumental. The closing anthem \\"I\\" is cool and unique in that it is one of the few songs song as a duet between Stanley and Simmons.<br /><br />\\"Music From the Elder\\" is also unique for a KISS album because it marks the beginning of one era and the end of another. This was Eric Carr's debut album with KISS. Unlike the jazzy style of Peter Criss, Carr was more of a heavy-metal drummer. Carr helps give this album an extra kick. This was also the last KISS album (sans Psycho Circus) to feature guitarist Ace Frehley. Some of Frehley's best solos are on this album, such as the one in \\"The Odyssey\\" \\"Under The Rose\\" and \\"The Oath.\\" Stanley's solo in \\"A World Without Heroes\\" is also really cool. As a big fan of both Carr and Frehley, I'm glad that they got to record at least one album together.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is not your typical KISS album. But it's a really cool album and I recommend giving it a chance. This may be rocks most underrated album. It's certainly KISS's most underrated one.interesting song.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|I was born and grew up in Idaho about 2 hours from Preston.  This film is based on a part of the culture found there, but also found in some form everywhere.  I never imagined there would be a film that would bring together two decades of the culture's oddities I knew growing up.  I can see why some people don't \\"get\\" this film.  This movie lets me laugh at some of the culture found in that part of the country.  I helps me to laugh at who I was/am and at the friends I had at that time of my life.  I suppose most people should be able to relate to Napoleon and his life be cause so few of us really fit in to all the norm's ... especially as a teenager in Jr. High and High School.  I think the film is oblviously pretty sweet.

B0002Z0EYK|2.0|I knew that this movie had removed itself from The Iliad, but that didn't bother me. <br />What did bother me was how unappealing almost everything about this movie was. <br />Achilles was a spoilt, egotistical, self-obsessed brat, Agamemnon a boorish braggart, as was his brother, Helen was just plain boring, Andromache looked like she'd just collapsed on the catwalk and was waiting to be force-fed, and Paris was a non-entity (I really don't think Orlando Bloom can act).  The only appealing character was Hector. <br />The large-scale battle scenes were okay, but I got sick of the pretty boy posturing and ludicrous balletic moves (of Achilles) in the showdown between Achilles and Hector. <br />About half way throught he movie I started fast-forwarding, which I NEVER do.  I just found it boring.
0440180295|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut Jr. does a fantastic job in the writing of Slaughterhouse Five. In each and everything he goes into great detail about it in order to give the reader a descriptive view of every piece of the novel.  <br /> <br />This book is different from any other. As it goes through many different times of Billy Pilgrim's, the main character's life. Billy travels through times of his life to face many different situation. <br /> <br />Although there is really no climax throughout the book, the reader is engaged at every moment waiting for the next time change to come. Vonnegut also keeps a constant theme running throughout each time period to tie the book together. With Vonnegut's skill of writing, he makes his book into one of the best. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book for any reader.

B0000027RL|5.0|Not only is Ten, almost undeniably, Pearl Jam's best album (though die-hard fans will probably deny that), it's also a strong contender for being the best the whole grunge movement had to offer, in direct competition with Soundgarden's 'Superunknown' and the masterpiece supergroup one-album effort of 'Temple of the Dog'. Ten is certainly more accessible than those two. It's curious that though at the time, Pearl Jam's music was accused of being too melodic and commercial for grunge, when compared to the movement's poster-boys, Nirvana; though they have certainly aged much better. Nirvana's music was perfect for a certain time and age, but Pearl Jam's lingers on and, as they were more melodic, more emotional, more intricate musically, and certainly more talented as musicians, it's still as moving and powerful.<br /><br />Actually, as a musical combo, Pearl Jam were hardly grunge at all. While the aforementioned Nirvana were a three-man organization, one guitar, no lead guitar per se, and not much of a drummer either, Pearl Jam's five men and three guitars seemed almost excessive, more like an alternative rock group really than a grunge band. Pearl Jam didn't sound like a bunch of angry Seattle kids who started playing together in Eddie Vedder's dad's garage; they sounded like fully pledged and educated musicians who know exactly what they were doing. Sure, they were loud and they were young and they were angry, but they seemed to be more focused on making music than on showing everybody just how pissed off they were. Gossard's and McCready's Gibsons intertwine beautifully and constantly, often with hardly any distortion at all, they are both virtuosos full of energy and emotion. Eddie Vedder is no bored, gloomy, misanthropic Kurt Cobain, either; his voice is as powerful and filled with emotion as those of the best of the blues-rock vocalists, Robert Plant, Ian Gillan and Stevie Winwood, and he is also a stage animal of amazing energies and bursting sex appeal. If Nirvana followed the school of the Sex Pistols, Pearl Jam followed the school of the Clash; or, subsequently, if Nirvana followed Iggy Pop, Pearl Jam followed Neil Young (no wonder they acted briefly as his backup band several years later). They were altogether more calculated, more in touch with their roots, and far more professional.<br /><br />The songs themselves are, each by its own right, classics. While Nirvana's 'Nevermind' had a couple of radio hits ('Smells Like Teen Spirit', 'Come As You Are'), a couple of angry and random screamers ('Territorial Pissings'), a few good songs and a few fillers, each song on Ten had incredible radio potential, and the whole thing feels like a greatest hits as much as an album. Indeed, a record number of songs from Ten are radio standards to this days, and not just the ones released as singles ('Alive', 'Even Flow', 'Jeremy', 'Black', 'Why Go') but even the less played ones are powerhouses by their own right, and I wouldn't be surprised to hear any single one of these songs played on mainstream radio... though I would be very pleased and turn the volume all the way up. The songs are emotional, intense, very personal - Eddie doesn't pretend to speak for the entire generation, he speaks just for himself - the music is powerful and Eddie's delivery is always perfect.<br /><br />Ten is an album that speaks for itself; it's immensely likable and can appeal to everyone. And though the songs are melodic, catchy and very likable upon first listening, they're also intricate and complex and reward repeated listening. It's an album almost anybody can enjoy, and it's an essential part of your music collection.Nirvana followed the school of the Sex Pistols, Pearl Jam followed the school of the Clash; or, subsequently, if Nirvana followed Iggy Pop, Pearl Jam followed Neil Young (no wonder they acted briefly as his backup band several years later).

I never knew it would be so bad.  This is an album that will make you fall asleep (a rap album on top of it).  I would recommend people to listen to the CD b4 buying it.

From Star Wars to Jurassic Park to Harry Potter, these movies would not be the movies they were without the amazing talent of John Williams. <br /> <br />And guys, take it easy on old Preston Jelmet. He's just trying to have a little fun. Don't take him so seriously.
B000002MJR|5.0|This was the first live album I've ever bought that rocks so hard, and this one does. This is the best live album ever! Heavy <br />Fuel is great on this album, and is my favorite song on the whole <br />album with great Mark riffs. Heavy Fuel is another hard rock/metal style song that I could listen to over n over again. <br />Others great are Walk of Life, and Money for Nothing. I recommend <br />Sultans of Swing, On Every Street, and Brothers in Arms in addition to this album. This version of Walk Of Life is even better though the studio version is still really good. Heavy <br />Fuel both studio and live are great versions. If you like Dire <br />Straits, then you most likely will need this album because it rocks, however these other DS albums are better but this is still <br />really good. I suggest you get this CD, I'll recommend you On <br />Every Street, or Brothers in Arms if you like this CD. <br /> <br />GREAT LIVE CD, WAY BETTER THAN ALCHEMY LIVE.

B0007O38F8|1.0|The Massacre: No Stars    It's an absolutely terrible cd, my idea with the massacre is the     A. Teenyboppers and suburban white americans who don't even know what hip hop is.    B. Ignorant suburban fans who are worshippers.    this is an gangsta rap cd without gangstas, it is dead in the water, The Songs are truly horrible, (especially really bad ones like candy shop), the GGGGG G-Unit catch phrase is the worst catch phrase creation in recent hip hop and music history.    The Rapping is horrible, the beats are stupid, there's no lyrical content whatsoever.    And I'm threw the day that were gonna have to deal with another 50 cent album.    This is truly the worst album of 2005 and it will be tying with Beg for Mercy as the worst album of this decade.
B0002OERI0|4.0|So many people have knee-jerk reactions to this album and get the wrong idea. Then they don't give it a chance and really miss out one of the best rock albums in quite some time. <br /> <br />The first misconception about \\"American Idiot\\" is that it is some sort of leftist or anti-American propaganda. This is simply untrue -- the album isn't even as political as most people perceive it to be. While the album obviously leans to the left, only two of its song's directly criticize the American way of life, and they do so in a constructive fashion. Green Day isn't saying that all American's are idiots or that America is awful, but that we need to turn off the TV and reevaluate the way we're living. <br /> <br />The second major misconception about this album is that its somehow a \\"sell-out\\" pop album. Sell-out has got to be the most overused term in all of music. Sell-out is just a way to say \\"This band isn't going in the direction that *I* want them to, and since I'm so unique and special, they *must* be sell-outs.\\" It's really quite arrogant for people who don't even *make* music to be calling anyone sellouts. In any case, I've seen some reviewers compare this album unfavorably to Dookie, saying that Dookie was pure punk and this is mainstream pop. Please! Everyone I knew owned Dookie when we were in junior high and didn't even understand music! GD's major-label debut was practically the birth of modern pop-punk. Seriously, people. <br /> <br />Anyways, ranting aside, American Idiot is a fantastic album. For redundancy's sake, I'll mention that this is a concept album. And I'll also make the point that it's pretty much impossible for a concept album to be mainstream, simply because most of us don't have that sort of attention span, or we just listen to whatever singles pop up and don't listen to the rest of the album. So while everyone and their brother will listen to Boulevard of Broken Dreams and the radio stations, rock and pop alike, will play it into the ground,there's still much more to see here. <br /> <br />From what I understand, American Idiot is a coming-of-age story about a kid known as Jesus of Suburbia. He's your typical suburban kid, living in a world of make-believe. The happy facade of suburban life melts away to reveal that Jesus' parents are seperated, he's bored and drugged up on Ritalin, raised by the television, and destined to \\"fall in love and fall in debt / to alchohol and cigarettes.\\" Jesus eventually is fed up with this dead-end life and the apathy of the world and moves to the city, where he reinvents himself and takes on a self-destructive lifestyle and meets and falls in love with a girl who is just as messed up and he is. Their carefree life crashes down (as it must) and the two go their seperate ways. Jesus cleans up, but finds himself just as miserable working the old 9-to-5, and in the end, is torn between the joy and the pain of his memories. <br /> <br />It's a pretty simple story, but very well and powerfully told. Billie Joe Armstrong's lyrics jump between clever observation, scathing indictment, and wailing desperation. The songs, too, vary from high-octane punk like \\"St. Jimmy\\" to soul-searching anthems like \\"We Are the Waiting.\\" Green Day has matured beyond the simple three-chord rockers of their earlier days. The guitars hear hop, sing, and thrash with equal precision, and the drums drive the beats perfectly. <br /> <br />Don't let yourself get turned off by the nay-sayers. This album is deep and well put-together, easily Green Day's best. The band has really matured into something special, and I'm eagerly awaiting their next effort.
B00003CX9W|5.0|-- And still a good one.<br /><br />Many of the vignettes here are now classics. Mickey as the Sorcerer's Apprentice: that's become an icon by itself. Dance of the Hours, with hippo ballerinas? I just laughed myself silly watching that, no matter how many times I've seen it before. Night on Bald Mountain - I must have been about four the first time I saw that, and I still remember how it scared the goobers out of me. That one scene, near the end, when the demon in charge is completely lit from the front, that's that one that sticks with me. For its time, it was about the most creative thing on the screen. The 'Disney Look' is a bit dated now, but it's true to the time in which it was made.<br /><br />I think today's kids might still like it, and it's a sneaky way to start them enjoying classical music. See it again with an adult's eyes, or see it again with a child's eyes. Just do yourself a favor and see it again.<br /><br />//wirdweird
B000059MEK|5.0|This has to be my favorite ablum ever. Every track is stellar and has infinite replay value. Cant wait for Human After All!
B0007N1AI6|4.0|This is a great, diverse effort from the re-formed Priest. It has everything a classic Priest album should: Speed Metal, Ballads, Plodders, Radio-friendly rockers. The better news is that almost all of it has a contemporary sound so that it holds up against much of the modern hard rock and metal heard across today's airwaves. <br />The musicianship is top notch - Halford is still the master of metal vocals (as also proven by his last 2, great solo releases) and Tipton & Downing are playing like a couple of 25 year old guitar virtuosos. Scott Travis plays a very competent set of double bass drums and Ian Hill's bass lines sound the same. <br />As for the songs: \\"Judas is Rising\\" kicks off the album with great speed, heaviness and melody with a great bridge and guitar solos. \\"Deal with the Devil\\" is one of those Halford homages to his early days as a fledgling metalhead - this one rocks hard but catchy with those tongue-in-cheek cliche lyrics. <br />\\"Revolution\\" is the current radio single - Priest probably wrote this in about 5 minutes, using what sounds like a riff from the 1st Halford solo album - but nevertheless it's OK. <br />\\"Worth Fighting For\\" - is a unique tune in the vein of \\"Take These Chains\\"  - to me it's one of the best (although softer) tunes on the album - Halford is really singing but in an almost disguised form - the song is ultra-catchy and has a great structure -with any luck this will be a \\"hit\\" for Priest. \\"Demonizer\\" - ultra heavy speed metal tune - very modern metal. \\"Wheels of Fire\\" - cliched, crunchy and melodic - a typical good Priest rocker. \\"Hellrider\\" - not my cup of tea but it's heavy. \\"Angel\\" - a Point of Entry/Sad Wings of Destiny style ballad. \\"Eulogy\\" - ballad type filler, \\"Loch Ness\\" - slow, goofy but fun and catchy with a sing-song chorus. <br /> <br />They just don't make albums like this anymore - so buy it and support what seems to be a newfound popularity in classic metal.
B0007MVXQG|4.0|Having been hypercritical of the mighty JP ever since 1986's Turbo debacle, I approached this reunion with great skepticism. I struggled to stomach Ram It Down, found a few of the Ripper-era tunes quite listenable, and thoroughly enjoyed the two HALFORD releases.     Onward... Angel of Retribution is quite simply Priest's best post-Defenders release. Never mind that the title's initials are AOR (Adult Oriented Radio). The classic twin axe guitar attack of Glenn and K.K. is superb, Halford's amazing voice is in top form, and <gasp> you can even hear some bass every now and then.     Priest puts its stamp all over the place on this one. I won't give you a song by song breakdown, but I will say that the mostly acoustic \\"Angel\\" is by far the biggest gamble these guys have taken in years. It lies somewhere before the dawn yet beyond the realms of death (pun intended), AND is quite simply a great tune.    On the downside (if you are still with me), \\"Revolution\\" has a great riff but grows tiresome upon repeated listenings, \\"Eulogy\\" is quasi-interesting but goes nowhere, and \\"Lochness\\" is just plain silly (and I don't use that word very often, mind you).    The DVD is a nice extra. It is well worth it for the acoustic clip of Diamonds & Rust alone. The members speak about the reunion and about how good it is to get back on road, etc. Very nice, indeed.    There you have it. Seven classic tunes (out of the ten). Go and worship at the Altar of the Priest. You won't be disappointed!!!
B0007N1AI6|3.0|Let me just say that I have been on board since the \\"Hell Bent for Leather\\" album.  What can I say, I have been waiting for this album since I saw the \\"Reunited\\" tour at Ozzfest this past summer.  The band played great and appeared to have a genuine hunger to them.  I pre-ordered this and I have to say it is already traded away.  The reviews that I have read here must have been after one listen at best.  The sound of classic Priest is here and that definitely puts a smile on my face.  Problem is that not a single track jumps off this CD.  The guitar tone and drums are top notch and Halford's voice sounds great for his age, hell, at any age.  The lyrics remind me of their \\"Ram It Down\\" or \\"Turbo\\" releases.  Moronic lyrics bringing this down.  What the hell is a \\"din\\" anyway?  The first listen proudly marks the return of the Priest but a few repeat listens shows the weakness of the material.  \\"Lochness\\" is just such a waste of tape.  On the dvd, they say they had more than enough material for this release.  It should have been put on here.  10 tracks for a 2005 release is a ripoff, this album clocks in at 40 some minutes with Lochness being over 13, not a lot of great material to listen to.  Without \\"Lochness\\", a 4 star release just for the classic Priest sound.  The dvd is a nice addition but I wish these guys would move their hands away from their faces during an interview.  Does Ian Hill talk?  Because he wasn't a part of the documentary at all.  \\"Diamonds and Rust\\" should never be done acoustically. This CD is not the place to start listening to Judas Priest, that would be either \\"British Steel\\" or \\"Hell Bent for Leather\\" for a classic JP CD.  \\"Metal Works\\" will give you a trial by fire to their sound and image. It is great to have them back and I will still see them on tour.
0451528956|4.0|I read Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by R.L. Stevenson.Because I enjoy reading mystery books.Overall, I think I made a pretty good choice.This book is about a man named Dr. Jekyll who has a double life because he drinks a potion with life long effects.After he drinks the potion, he turns into Mr. Hyde.Eventually he doesn't drink the potion to turn into Mr. Hyde, and change happens on it's own. As Mr. Hyde he creates a whole bunch of terror.A fter a while you think some one would catch him out there doing unlawful things. But what if they don't? This could go on for ever!Overall, I liked the book It was very suspencfull and full of surprises. All while still being a very good book. It always had me guesing what would happen next.I reccomend this book to everyone it was very good.
B00003CX5P|5.0|People sometimes say things like \\"Elvis should have died in 1959\\". Their point being that our memories of the King would always be of a young, trim Elvis instead of the fat, sweaty Elvis who(while performing in a drug induced stupor)would forget the lyrics of his songs. Well, upon completing The Empire Strikes Back(The best Star Wars film and the last one that didn't suck. That's right people, Return of the Jedi sucked)George Lucas should have gone home, put a shotgun in his mouth and pulled the trigger.
B000002H33|5.0|what can i say about this album IT KICKS ASS!!!!!!!! but i kinda like more Ride The Lighting for some reason but still this is one hell of an album.
B00006AVRK|5.0|Started reading Wodehouse for the first time this year, and became an addict.  This series perfectly captures the wit and feel of the novels, even if details get tweaked to make the stories work visually. <br /> <br />I was a little disappointed when they swapped out actors for Gussie in the 3rd season since the actor who played him in the first two seasons was superb.  (I must have replayed the scene where Gussie mimics the male newt's courting dance 50 times and brayed like a donkey every time.) <br /> <br />Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry are perfection as Bertie and Jeeves; their expressions and timing - well, everything they do - are a delight. By the way, this set is worth the price just for the side-splitting cow creamer episodes, which Wodehouse wrote in \\"The Code of the Woosters.\\"
6305252521|5.0|This has got to be one of the greatest films in years. I'm not sure if anyone else has conjectured this, but I believe the film is a beautiful alegory about god. Truman lives his whole life under the control of one man,(who lives in the sky no less!) and by the end of the film, he has had a revealation about his potential; he realizes he has more hope in the \\"real\\" world than in Christof's. I believe Truman leaving the T.V. show at the end of the film is symbolic of a person leaving the protective bubble of god and exploring the possibilty of hope and beauty outside of a bounded life. But don't take my word for it, see the movie, and god forbid you actually think about it after it's over!
0385491026|4.0|Cat's Eye deals with the unconfortable subjet of childhood bullying, and the psychological wounds that it inflicts on later stages of life. The novel's main character Elaine, is a conflicted and insecure painter whose friendship with Cordelia has marked her through childhood, adolescense and adulthood. Atwood explores complex childhood issues like the difference between boys' and girls' play and the effects of having a brother, and of course, the bullying itself. This part of the novel is extremely interesting, and the writing of course, sublime. Later on we see how Elaine grows, and we see how underneath the sharp-witted girl there is the childhood angst, still there.    What can I say about the writing? Beautiful, poetic, sharp, Atwood proves once again she is the master of imagery. Another gem is the description of Elaine's paintings, with great symbolism. Highly recommended!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is wonderfully entertaining. Even as adults we find ourselves quoting the lines to the movie. My kids loved it and we are going to purchase it. Not at all like your other cookie cutter teen comedies. If you like independent type films and foreign films you will love ND.  <br />A+++++
B00003CXE7|1.0|My buddy Beau and I went to see this movie a week after it opened. We had heard a lot of hype about the \\"film\\" and we were very excited about  the potential orgiastic cinema experience that lay ahead! Needless to say this is the cinematic equivalent of blue-balls. Never before have I left a theater with a feeling of such utter disapointment.  I am still waiting to see the version that was screened for members of the academy, because the version I saw was about as Oscar-worthy as \\"White Chicks\\". If you are looking for a truly great \\"gladiator\\" movie, buy the special edition of Conan the Barbarian. The commentary alone is worth the price, trust me.
B00007KQA3|4.0|This is literary adaption at its best: instead of shooting for a straight retelling of a great novel, this film version tries to capture the novel's essence.<br /><br />Stark, bleak, unflinching, \\"1984\\" also adds grime and dinginess to this totally corrupt and harrowing world of the future.  I even found some of the shots quite beautiful--which is weird because of the dark and corrosive feel of the scenes.<br /><br />I thought it was a cool idea for the filmmakers to produce a version of NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR in the year 1984.  Thankfully, America was riding the crest of the Reagan Revolution with Bruce Springsteen's \\"Born in the USA\\" playing on the radios (for a few older hippies, that WAS \\"1984\\" to them!), so I think the film has found its audience in the years since, and rightly so.<br /><br />Sadly, this was Richard Burton's final film.  And he looked the part perfectly: older, broken, hopeless.<br /><br />I believe he even says while torturing John Hurt into total submission, \\"They got to me a long time ago.\\"
0670033375|5.0|Jared Diamond is a professor of geography at UCLA.  This bias is evident in all the cultures he discusses.  Every country has geographic limits- the location, soil fertility and weather of lands set parameters that are not easily breeched.  Poor stewardship such as cutting too many trees or ruining top soil often push a territory into perilous times.  Finally, a dysfunctional cultural practice such as being unwilling to abandon a destructive lifestyle (eg. sheep farming) may doom a people.  Diamond describes several countries, past and present, with a compelling narrative well grounded in geography and science. <br />     <br />    He does not just write about past failures- some countries have kicked bad habits.  But there are plenty of places on the planet that are pursuing courses that will lead to destruction if changes are not employed.   <br /> <br />    I love books that are loaded with data.  This book draws on current anthropological techniques and geological evidence to answer questions that well-informed people ought to know.  Before reading this book, I would have been in doubt about the following:  \\"Why isn't Montana the big timber producing state it used to be?\\"  \\"Just why did the Anasazi abandon their cities in the Southwest?\\"  \\"How come the Dominican Republic isn't in the same fix as Haiti?\\"  \\"Why does Australia insist on exporting wine instead of potatoes?\\" <br /> <br />    Also, I learned more about fairly current news stories (Rwandan genocide and Caribbean immigration) than I ever would have from newspapers or The History Channel. <br /> <br />    I admit that the book is repetitive, even tedious in spots.  At the end, I felt like the good boy who had finally swallowed the last of his spinach.  But I am grateful that we have scientists who are willing to make us question how we live.  There are no predictions here.  Dr. Diamond is like Fox News-  he provides the facts and lets you decide.   <br /> <br />    I feel obliged to conclude by stating what strikes me as the book's single-most worrisome point and then its single-most optimistic revelation.  Be forewarned that failed civilizations have often been ignorant of their fate.  Collapse tends to occur only a decade or two after the culture is at its peak.  Such is the way resources are consumed. <br /> <br />     Here's the optimistic point.  More and more, the public is supplied its \\"stuff\\" by huge chains-  ie. Safeway, McDonalds, Home Depot, etc.  If the buying public feels that these companies should follow certain environmental practices, the stores quickly change their policy.  Corporations fear customers more than government commissions.  Take note global villager;  you may save the world.
B0002X314C|3.0|Let me say first an foremost that compared to his contemporaries this is a good album.  There really isn't alot of RnB played on the radio or that produce videos.  We have maybe a half dozen RnB artist and about 3 times as many rap artist.  So because there just is not enough quality music produced today the public will run to any facsimile.  Like viewing a mirage of an oasis in the desert. <br /> <br />I am not going to give this album a pass because of the music that is currently produced.  For an artist or an album to be great he would have to reach the status of Marvin Gaye (Let's Get it On), Donnie Hathaway(Extension of a Man) or Stevie Wonder(Songs in the Key of Life).  If you know of these albums and believe that Get Lifted is in this category talk about it.  Till then please reserve \\"Great\\" for those that truly deserve it. <br /> <br />This album has some tracks that are very good but for some reason I felt a little cheated.  I would have prefered more John Legend and less Kanye West (you can tell the tracks influenced by Kanye).  Maybe on the next album he will have a little more control and be able to exert more influence. <br /> <br />As for now this is a good album amongst mediocre albums of its time period.  There are those who want to say its not fair to compare him to those artist.  You know what its more than fair because music is continuum it does not stop and start with one generation or period.  It continues on and on and the history is just as important as the present or future. <br /> <br />
B0000C5RQF|1.0|When I see an opera on screen it is because I do not only want to appreciate the music but also enjoy the visual interpretation. Listening to this version, the musicians, singers, conductor, chorus, orchestra are all very good to excellent. The costumes, scenery, and and how the performers act on stage I find strange, dark, and not in keeping with the way I understand Mozart. Even though it could be said that Die Zauberflote is a philosophical theme, I do not see it as a dark piece as this version portrays. My previous experiences of Die Zauberflote on the screen were the Swedish film version and the Metropolitan Opera version, which I liked much better. In the end it depends on one's perception of Mozart's Zauberfloete how a particular version is liked.
1400032717|5.0|As many reviewers have already detailed, this novel is written from the perspective of a young austic boy who sets to solve the mystery of who killed his neighbor's dog. <br /> <br />Not being austic or really even knowing anyone who is austic, I cannot vouch for the authenticity of the novel. But I can say it is totaly engaging, beautifull written and rendered and utterly believable. <br /> <br />What makes it so, is that Haddon (the author) gives Christopher's (the narrator) a strong and believable voice. You here him and can see him moving through the world. It is first-person narration at some of its best. Yet Haddon (the author) renders things with enough detail and all of the voices of the characters are so strong, so true, that you are also able to see and understand events that young Christopher is not able to grasp. <br /> <br />As Christopher unwraps the puzzle of the murder, he is also unwrapping the events of his life. He and the other main characters of the book are growing, changing and coming to grips with their larger places. And often, you are there before they can get. <br /> <br />In many ways, this book reminded me of Catcher in The Rye but much (!!) less controversial or shocking and with less anger. But it is a coming of age story by a less then fully emotionally developed character, with issues all his own.  <br /> <br />This is not a complex book that makes you think differently about the world and it will not change your life or anything of the sort. <br /> <br />But what it will do is let you hear a remarkable voice and give you a gripping read, neither of which you will forget anytime soon.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I watched this movie at 1:00 a.m. january 1st and i found that this was the most painfuly hilarious movie in the world. i watched it a few weeks later and didn't think it was. so my advice to you is watch this movie(if you haven't already) at late partys and u'll have a blast........
B0007TKNL0|4.0|Before I begin, I just want to say I have the broadway soundtrack and listen to it all the time. I have been trained in music and have seen the play 5 times. So I know what I am talking about. <br />bad first  <br />As for the costumes and directing, it almost ruined the movie. When I first saw Roul, I thought yuck, I hated the hair and his clothes, and I love period peices. But  Patrick acting let me to at least feel pity for him. Also Christine and Megs costumes, I could not have believe them to change that often in a real play. Also there are sence where Christians dancing without a chin then has it then doesn't, when the phantom comes to get her she has light make-up on and half way down the tunnel dark make-up on, she has stocking on then doesn't. The Phantom's make-up at the end isn't the same from sence to sence. The masked ball she has her mask then doesn't. There are other mistakes that should have been caught. <br />And I think they ruined the grave yard sence. Having Roul leave only moments after Christine and the Phantom left but showing up way later. Also I didn't like the sword fighting sence, it didn't make sence. <br /> <br />now the good <br /> <br />But the acting was great by the leading men, and Minnie, as for Emmy she did ok. though I didn't like the dancing by the back ground dancers in the point of no return. I thought they should have stayed focus on Christine and The Phantom, with glances at Roul.  <br />The emotion that Gerard put into the phantom was for lack of better word GREAT. I felt his pain and strugle. <br />As I already commented Patrick acting had me also feeling his pain and I could soo tell that he was Musical trained.  <br />Emmy's singing was good but her acting was not up to par in one sence she looks scared then not then scared I don't know if that was the directors fault or hers. I have a feeling it was the directors.  <br />I am getting this movie and think people should see it. I only wished the directing was better. It would have been perfect then.
B00005JLEU|4.0|Referring to previous reviews, I find it particularly heinous for an anime fan to imply that Miyazaki has a feebleminded imagination.    Ouch...that's so unforgivably tacky. Also, it'd be ideal that making sure meaning isn't lost in translation would be the director's responsibility; no such luck, particularly with dubbed anime, and especially with Disney. It's always been an issue that's been apparent since anime crossed over from Japan. That said, Spirited Away is an amazing movie, and while Otomo and Oshi are forces to be reckoned with, so is Miyazaki.
B00063EMJ6|4.0|This is a classic case of just being too little, even though everything on here is amazing, and I understand some people do just want one disc of songs. Overall this really is a good dose of what the man is known for, and the sound is incredible, but any casual fan could easily pick another 16 tracks for inclusion, even without dipping into the Buffalo Springfield or CSN&Y tunes. Almost everything here is from his classic 70's era, but only 2 songs from that time on??? This could also have been called \\"Volume One\\", or \\"The Early Years\\". Just from \\"This Note's For You\\" on, where is \\"No More\\", \\"Unknown Legend\\", \\"Change Your Mind\\", \\"Downtown\\", \\"Razor Love\\", etc., not to mention another handful from the 1970's. Anyway, regardless of a fan's opinion like mine, this is some of the best music ever laid down, all by the \\"Old Man\\" with a \\"Heart Of Gold\\".
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Just another vote for \\"absolutely fabulous.\\" I see it as the best Western movie/series to come along in a very long time. Well worth the price. It is indeed very re-watchable.
B00062ZE44|5.0|Sharon Den Adel voices, their overall sounds, their songwriting & their music composition have been improved! This album sounds very modern! <br /> <br />If you're an Evanescence, Lacuna Coil or Nightwish's fan, you will love this album! I hope they will release a new live DVD for this album! NO DOUBT, BUY IT NOW! <br /> <br />Within Temptation rulesssssssssss!!!!!!!!
0790740443|5.0|Kurt Russles performance is dead-on.  The strict enforcement of dicipline, obeyance of orders, complete committment to mission, lack of emotion.  It's impossible for the average person to relate in any sense to Russles character.  It's probably the main reason the movie didn't get much press. And didn't do well at the box office.  My favorite scheme is where Russle is alone using the Steel canister as a punching bag. Putting huge dents in it. You can feel the rage.  Ever wonder what his character must have been thinking?  My favorite line - When Connie Neilson is panacking over the attacking bad guys.  She asks Sergeant Todd - \\"What are you going to do?\\" Todd replies in a matter of fact dead pan way \\"I'm going to kill them all, sir!\\".  To hear Russle deliver that line....sheer poetry.    The story line is good up until the battle scenes later in the move. Then the story falls apart. Lots of explosions and violence.  The elite younger soldiers suddenly forget how to be soldiers and fall easy prey to the older Sgt Todd(Russles Character).  The directing and editing seem a little sloppy. There is one scene when Russle appears to be rising up out of the water firing his machine gun. WHAT! rewind and look again. The flames and smoke in the background are all moving downward into the water.  The 1st 2/3 rds of the movie make up for it.
B00000J7RZ|4.0|On this album, Jennifer is wonderful.  I love the beats, and her voice sounds great.  Good debut album:).
B0002SROT0|5.0|Elliot Smith totally captured me from the moment I saw him on the Grammy's. Just guts & guitar in front of all the industry giants, singing his deceivingly simple song. Who will fill the hole that the passing of Elliot has left. Lyrically Conor Oberst maybe, musically, nobody. I had a chance to meet Elliot a few times when I worked as a photographer in Portland and am a guitarist and songwriter too. Elliot had personal demons in his head to be sure. It was great to see a smiling photo of him on FABOAH, I needed that. This CD is simply fantastic. It is deep. It is not necessarily depressing. Thats the trick 'to take a sad song and make it better' Elliot made it better. We need to make it better in our own heads. This CD sounds beautiful. If you liked any of Elliot's music before this I believe stands as his best. If you haven't bought any of Elliot's stuff this is the one because it covers all of his stages in a way. A very fitting farewell, if there is such a thing. Fly away Elliot, be happy for once.
B00005N83M|4.0|I really enjoyed this album.  Not as good as On the 6, but still nice.  Jennifer's voice sounds wonderful here!  She may not be a Whitney Houston, but i think she sounds better than Britney Spears(who is a good perfomer as well).
0684874350|5.0|Angela's Ashed by Frank McCourt is a story about a man looking back on his childhood. This is a really moving book. You see a kid who had to act as a adult at a young age. This author shows us the tragedies he had to go through as a young boy. First they lived in Brooklyn, New York during the depression and then move to the slums of Limerick in Ireland. The McCourt family barely ever has food. They had to beg on the streets and to the church to survive the day. I and anyone else can walk away from this book and feel grateful for their life in America. Through this book Frank McCourt takes you through his whole life from before he was born till he got away. Reading about such a determine kid inspires you. This boy was dieing to come to a place that we all take for granted. Everyday Frank would look at a model of the Statue of Liberty and pray he was in America.  Anyone can learn from this book and walk away inspired.
B00002MZ4W|2.0|Ok, its been a long time since this album was released, but I was looking over some of my favs today on amazon (Tidal being one of them) and I couldn't believe the reviews people are giving this.  Now I'm just as hard core Apple fan as anyone, but this album was such a let down after the deep emotion that she gave us in the Tidal album.  Its like she tried to go more main stream and up beat... but anyone that loved Tidal doesn't go to Fiona for up beat... we want deep feeling, something that makes us reflect upon ourselves.  This just doesn't deliver.
B000002G7E|4.0|Distortion. Either you love it or you hate it, and that will determine whether you love or hate the Velvet Underground's \\"White Light/White Heat,\\" which was the final album with John Cale on it. It's strange, raw and eerie, and except for the too-long finale, a fairly good collection.<br /><br />It kicks off with distorted pop song \\"White Light/White Heat,\\" and gets followed by equally distorted series of offbeat songs, such as the sex-change operation ballad \\"Lady Godiva's Operation,\\" the relatively ethereal \\"Here She Comes Now,\\" and the twisted, squealing riffs of \\"I Heard Her Call My Name.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Gift\\" is perhaps the most offbeat of all the tracks here: A spoken story-song, recited matter-of-factly in John Cale's Welsh accent. It's about a jealous husband who, in doubt about his wife's fidelity, mails himself to her house. Sounds ordinary enough, except that there is a twist to the finale, both funny and macabre.<br /><br />This is one of the darker albums that the Velvet Underground did, as well as the last one that was so experimental. The finale is almost twenty minutes of screeching, explosive guitar riffs, and the story-song is definitely odd. But once you get into the swing of it, it's remarkably moving.<br /><br />The fuzz and wildness of \\"White Light/White Heat\\" is definitely offputting at first -- the melodies are buried under a perpetual buzz of sound. That lo-fi flavor won't be to everyone's taste, but those who like their music rough, raw and ragged will probably like the murky riffs and muffled drumming, rising out of a thick mass of fuzz.<br /><br />For those who don'ty like distortion, it might be a comfort to just focus on the offbeat lyrics -- they can be vulgar, nasty, enchanting, or they can be brimful of black comedy. At least, they are never boring. In his VU swansong, Cale gets to recite and sing, and his rich vocals prove to be somewhat more compelling than Lou Reed's.<br /><br />While perhaps the weakest, rawest and least accessible of the Velvet Underground's albums, \\"White Light/White Heat\\" has the distinction of Cale's vocals and some wickedly weird writing.east accessible of the Velvet Underground's albums, \\"White Light/White Heat\\" has the distinction of Cale's vocals and some wickedly weird writing.
B000002OZY|5.0|man when i listen to this cd im in heaven. i just sit back and relax and listen to the story. this is one of the GREATEST albums ever made. <br /> <br />on a side note. every review i've read on here to every version of this album says that the mother and the lover kill the father. i always understood it as the father kills the lover then talks the mother into going along with it. first set of lyrics is the lover. 2nd set is the father (you think 21 is gonna be a good year for me and her maybe but you and her NO, NEVER.) then the 3rd set is the mother convincing herself it will be ok (But somehow when you smiled I could brave bad weather) <br /> <br />thats just my 2 cents tho.
0783225199|5.0|Jake Blues(Jim Belushi) has just got out of the pen. Elwood Blues (Dan Aykroyd) is there to pick him up. Now it's a ride to see \\"The Penquin\\" (a nun played by the magnificent Kathleen Freeman). When they arrive, she tells them that the orphanage may be closed, and that they need money to keep it going. Jake makes a remark that causes the penquin to take out her yard stick, and send them scurrying out the door. Elwood makes it down, but jake takes a tumble. The penguin comes out and tells them not to return until they've redeemed themselves. While still at the orphanage, they come across an old friend who tells the pair that they need to go to church, and recommends a minister to them. Soon they find themselves at church. It is headed by Reverend Cleophus James (James Brown),who starts preaching, then, like in some cool churches, the Spirit of the Lord comes over him, and he starts to dance sing and shout, and then the whole congregation joins in. I've been in churches like this and thoroughly love them. In the old(and in the new) South, nothing can beat passing by an African American church on Sunday morning!!! Better yet, being there in the congregation!!! And in the movie, the Spirit of the Lord comes upon Jake so strong, he too travels down the aisles of the church cutting cartwheels. He makes his way back to Elwood who is wondering what in the world has happened to Jake, who is shaking from head to toe. Jake let's him know that now he has the answer, the all inspiring answer to getting money for the orphanage...THE BAND!!! The two were once a part of an R & B band. Now Jake wants to get them back together and do some gigs to raise money for the orphanage. This sends Elwood to dancing in the aisles. This scene is perfectly choreographed, because it is just like it really is in certain churches...with one exception, the comical heights to which some of the men jump while they are feeling the Spirit. Now Jake and Elwood head out on a quest to find the rest of the band members and hit the road. A few of them are relunctant at first to join their old band, but Jake and Elwood's techniques in persuasion lead them to join.  <br />But will the band get the money needed in time to keep the orphanage from being closed? You'll need to see the movie to find out. I own a vhs version of the film, and it is in my video library among my favorites. It is a very popular movie with loads (and I do mean LOADS) of stars in it. Ray Charles plays a shop owner who supplies the band with some of their instruments. Aretha Franklin plays one of the band member's wife. Carrie Fisher plays Jake's ex-girlfriend who's a tad bit \\"upset\\". Henry Gibson plays a Nazi who has it in for Jake and Elwood because they ran him and his men over a bridge and into a pond during a rally. In short, there are over 90 people who were either stars at the time or later became super stars or semi-popular stars. And there are so many comical scenes in this film, there are simply too many to mention. But a few that stick out in my mind are of course the church scene, then there is where Jake's ex uses a bazooka to try and kill him. There's the car chase that ends up going through a crowded mall (by the way, it was one of the costliest movie/car chase scenes in history), then there is the car chase involving crowds of lawmen. The car chase involving the Nazis' was a laugh riot, then of course there is the dance scene outside Ray's store.  <br />There is a slight amount of strong language, but not enough to really concern anyone about. If you want a movie that is well liked by millions of people, that has lots of action, drama, music(Ray Charles Aretha Franklin and Cab Calloway each do a song in the movie), suspense, and loads of comedy, you are sure to want this spectacular film.
0380733358|4.0|In perusing the pages of this novel, I found countless aspects which appealed to me, from the strong character developments to the exciting plot, but it was the character of \\"Henry Faber\\" which most interested me.  It is very rare to find a novel which indirectly presents one who would normally be teh villain as the hero in a sense.  By the end, I wanted Faber to escape Britain and successfully expose the allied deceit, despite the horrid consequences such an even would have entailed for the world.  Follet was exceedingly successful in garnering support and sympathy for an otherwise nefarious character; an apathetic Nazi agent with only a shade of conscience.  I musn't give any important plot developments away, but I must say I was very sad with the end.  In essence though, this was a very engaging story with a dynamic and exciting plot and well developed characters, and perhaps one of the quickest reads I've yet encountered (it took only a few hours to read).
B000002WMH|5.0|It's hard to believe that the most important body of recordings in all of rock music can be neatly fit onto four CDs; but that - along with a fifth disc of very agreeable rarities, alternate takes and live material - is exactly what THE KING OF ROCK & ROLL offers. Here it is, all beautifully remastered and conveniently assembled in one gorgeous and highly informative package: both sides of Elvis' 1953 debut acetate recording (a gift for his mother); all of the epochal 1954-55 Sun masters; the complete 1956-58 RCA sessions (chart-topping singles, underrated album tracks, all four 1950s movie soundtracks en toto with plenty of silly stuff to leaven the proceedings throughout); even a press interview from the King's final Stateside hours before leaving for army service in Germany! If the essence of everything rock music ever was, is or might someday be could possibly be tucked inside a box, then make no mistake - this is the box. <br />   No one comes to Elvis (especially early Elvis) as a complete stranger, so I won't even attempt to catalogue or critique the 140 tracks offered herein; but whether you're buying this essential material for the first time or upgrading prior purchases, THE KING OF ROCK & ROLL is without question the cornerstone of any serious rock music collection.
B000002H97|5.0|After posting a handful of reviews I've decided to go back and do my own best of artist section/ Meaning I'm going to go back and review my favorite albums from some of my favorite bands. This is the album that first came to mind. Upon its release there was a bit of a Metallica back lash, as they were no longer a band just for the metal heads. This backlash is similar to what occured with the release of St. Anger a year or so back. The black album, as it has been dubbed, is the first album with Bob Rock. This is significant because it is Bob Rock that cleaned up the Metallica sound, replacing speed with chunk and melody. Also he challenge the lyrics of James, this album strays from the dark politic atmosphere that was present on the three of the albums prior to this. Ride the Lightning, ...And justice for all and of course Master of Puppets. Instead the lyrics are a little more introverted. Songs like \\"Wherever I may roam\\" is the story of Metallica's life on the road. However, I am not going to go through this album song by song, it has been done by everybody before me, and there is no purpose in me doing so. Chances are if you are even reading this review you are either like me and curious as to what others think of your favorite albums, or B trying to decide whether or not you want to give Metallica a try. If the latter this is the album I would recommend and here's why. It falls right in the middle of the bands sound. The aggression from the early albums are present in songs like \\"Don't tread on me\\" and \\"Through the never\\" but the softer more melodic side is in full force as well. \\"Unforgiven\\" is the bands original slow ballad, and presonal there is no touching \\"nothing else matters\\" for it's sincerity. Unless you are obsessed with speed metal and to ignorant to evolve, you really can't go wrong with this album.

B00005JMXX|4.0|This is the most effectivley powerful film I have ever seen. Spectacular in every way. The general plot of the film has impact, the FX are unique beyond anything witnessed in the film industry.  <br /> <br />The Story is all about global cataclysm climate disaster, or mother nature returning the favour of sucking her dry of natrual resources - indeed. The start of the film throws us straight in  the deep end, news reports of indians walking in a winter wonderland, the collapsing antartic and basically terrible weather everywhere. The general humanising (making it as if real people are in it - what we would do in other words) is extrememly acurate, even for the americans, bless them. The Day After Tommorow generally sums up our way of life, humans. We only seem to care about ourselves and fellow humans, if there is a super disaster then WE have to survive, as long as WE have fuel WE are fine, the American president (actually the vice presiident for some reason) is bush and Clinton rolled into one, denying the coming storm, \\"Our economey is just as fragile as the enviroment\\", which is dead short sited - BUSH IF YOUR READING THIS, DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT - - GIT.
B000002JB8|5.0|This is one of my favorite Vangelis albums, second only to his jaw-dropping-ly good \\"Bladerunner\\" soundtrack.  I find many of the tunes to be very hypnotic and soothing, especially when he mixes in actual sounds of waves crashing on the beach. The best song on this disc is without a doubt \\"Song of the Seas.\\"  I've often put that song on, set my player to \\"repeat\\" and listened to it over and over again.

Sarah Connor is in a mental hospital for predicting Judgement day but she's a target too, and she, JOhn and Terminator have to preventing it.

B00068CVJ4|5.0|This is the 2004 Fearless Records re-issue which contains the bonus tracks \\"Extracurricular\\" and \\"Catacombs\\". Originally released in 2000 on the now defunct Grand Royal Records, this is the final album released by this amazing band. In my opinion this is a great album made even better with the addition of the previously mentioned bonus tracks. As sad as it is to see one of the most inovative punk bands of all time call it quits, at least they did it at their pinnacle. This album has all the power, energy, and emotion you've come to expect from ATDI, with the added bonus of better recording quality, making all the little quirks and layers more audible and the over all sound is richer than ever. Ever changing and always progressive, this album takes it all to the next level and beyond. A must have for anyone who is a fan of loud, kinetic, dynamic, powerful, and beautiful music. This is arguably their best album, but also their most commercially successful and their only major label release. I own (as in purchased the actual albums not downloaded replicas) over 500 CD's and records and my collection would be empty without ALL the At the Drive-In albums. Buy this Album.<br /><br />**After their break up in 2001 members split to form the bands Sparta (ATDI:rhythm guitarist, basist, and drummer) and the Mars Volta (ATDI: vocalist and lead guitarist). These bands are worth a listen as well.
1592400876|5.0|When you hear that this book is about punctuation, you might think that it would be really boring.  I thought that too, but I really enjoyed this book.  I learned a lot about punctuation, and now I can point out common mistakes that people would not normally recognize as an error.   <br /> <br />Lynne Truss is a very interesting author.  She made me want to learn about correct punctuation.  She has more of a sophisticated sense of humor, but if I can understand it, I'm sure you can too. <br /> <br />I would really recommend reading this book.  Its very educational, and its also fun to read.  It clears up some of the confusing punctuation in the English language, and its just a quick, fun read.  <br /> <br />WARNING: After reading this book, you might be looking closer at ads and writing to pick out punctuation misuse!
B0000AQVCL|1.0|My, my what an awful album! Sure they sound alright as far as sound is concerned- heck \\"Are you gonna be my girl\\" is catchy enough, but the complete lack of any originality on their part is horrible, without excuse. Even the band themselves have a lame excuse when asked why their hit single sounded so much like several other songs; they said \\"you can't copyright a riff.\\" Pick this album apart and I dare anyone to find a scrap of something new. The band's name? From a Paul McCartney song. The album title? A lyric from Bob Dylan's 'Subterranian Homesick Blues.' The album art? The beatles' 'revolver.' Luckily I don't forsee anything coming from this band in the future; but I may be very wrong, if the populace still is able to consume this stuff. In conclusion; if you've been living under a musical rock since 1959 this album will sound new and fresh. If you haven't you might still like it to play at your school dance.
B00000DD1S|5.0|For reference scroll down to the inflamed review by Camper-man.   <br /> <br />This reviewer's attempt to turn \\"the New Thing\\" into some kind of lame footnote to 20th century atonal classical music just inspires a kind of great rage, in that I've never heard anyone do this, or care to.  Especially great is the reference to John Coltrane's free-jazz regression, betraying an incomprehension so staggering only someone trained to perceive art with the sterile and tedious blinders of university education could produce it. <br /> <br />In fact, many free jazz musicians weren't particularly enthralled by most of those explorations.  Rather they saw their music as a tool to convey the idea of being, and their idiom grew organically from Louis Armstrong and Charlie Parker who had similar coherent and rational goals.  That is, they wished to convey emotion and the idea of comprehension, a goal apparently beneath so many stellar masturbators of 20th century atonal music, whose work shall be the proverbial piss into the urinal when Albert Ayler and John Coltrane are being listened to in a thousand years.   <br /> <br />The ponderous and sagging theory, the horrendous self-referentiality of these deluded musical modernists, will go into the o'erflowing boxes of discredited nonsense idiots have suckled at since time immemorial, and yet the \\"New Thing\\" will stand as a bold statement of being in a time when for some unfathomable reason, this very idea was considered vulgar by the irrelevent musical learned.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I watched this concert on TV when It was first shown &amp; have been kicking myself ever since for not recording it.

Yes! most of them were excellent live acts who could really perform live. The picture &amp; sound quality on the USA footage especially was not perfect but hey if you read the superb booklet that comes with the box set it is understandable. This is THE standard for all others to aspire to, the producers of the &quot;Woodstock special edition&quot; DVD should take note...
B0001Z52RU|5.0|For such an intriguing subject as `time travel' (using the term loosely), there are very few stories, much less movies, that can carry off the subject with an interesting approach.  `The Butterfly Effect' falls into the rank of excellence along with the movie `Donnie Darko' and the book `Replay' by Ken Grimwood.<br /><br />Evan Treborn (played surprisingly well by Aston Kutcher) has been plagued by strange memory blackouts throughout his childhood, usually occurring at traumatic times in his life.  And Evan's life is ripe with trauma.  He and his friends Kayleigh Miller (a showcase role for Amy Smart) and Lenny Kegan (Elden Henson) must deal with the problems from their childhood as they grow into adults.  For Evan, his problems are made worse by the fact that his father is insane and in a psychiatric hospital, and Evan has never met him.  When Evan does meet his father, his father tries to choke him and is killed, but Evan can't remember why because of a blackout.<br /><br />Later, while in college and free from his blackouts for over seven years, something strange happens to Evan while he is glancing through his old journals.  Spurred by this incident to try and find out more about his past, Evan visits his old friends Kayleigh and Lenny to question them.  Lenny is disturbed and still lives at home building models, and Kayleigh is working as a waitress, scarred too deep on the inside to make a better life for herself.  When Evan is informed of Kayleigh's suicide by her brutal and psychotic brother, he decides to harness the strangeness that comes from reading his journals.<br /><br />Evan finds he can go back, travel into his childhood, into the dead places left by his blacked out memory, and attempts to save Kayleigh in this way.  What follows is a taut and thrilling roller coaster ride in which for every fix Evan attempts, he changes the entire course of his life and the lives of his friends.  And before its too late, Evan needs to find a way to fix everyone, even if it means losing the only girl he's ever loved.<br /><br />Ashton Kutcher surprised me in this movie, moving from silly comedies to a serious role with a clean style and well displayed talent.  The role of Kayleigh for Amy Smart was perfect, giving her a wide variety of characterization to spiral through as Evan continues his pursuit to bring about the changes that will leave each of his friends in a better life.  Watch for Eric Stoltz as George Miller, Kayleigh's dad, in a shocking character that he performs with excellence.  More great supporting roles from Melora Walters as Evan's mom Andrea, Elden Henson as Lenny, and the perfectly done character of Thumper, played by the talented Ethan Suplee (John Q, Evolution).<br /><br />`The Butterfly Effect' is not an action packed thriller, but you will still be glued to your set, watching how events unfold in different and unexpected ways, adding twists now and than that will leave you changing your mind about certain characters and crossing your fingers for Evan, Kayleigh, Lenny, and Tommy.

B00005JNBQ|4.0|At some point in our lives, we've all been the geek.  Some of us(like myself), have been the geek one too many times.  This film lets us laugh at those who are geeks, those who beat up the geeks, and the snobby little popular girls who toy with the geeks.<br /><br />The film is basically about a few days in the life of a not-so-likeable dork named Napoleon, and his more likeable friend, Pedro, as well as his chatroom-happy brother, Kip, and his uncle, Rico.  They are all losers in one way or another.  Rico's trapped in the past, like so many former high school jocks.  Kip has fallen in love with his on-line friend he has never met.  Pedro is just kind of there, too shy to really stand out.  Then there's Napoleon.  He is in a class all to himself.  He draws fantasy creatures(I can relate), likes to save tater tots for later(in his pockets, unwrapped), and is pretty annoying all in all.<br /><br />Pedro is in love with the school's most popular girl(Hilary Duff's sister), but she doesn't even know he exists, until he decides to run against her for class president.  Even then, she blows him off as no threat.  Napoleon is sort of his campaign manager and his \\"secret service captain.\\"  He also sort of pursues Deb, another geek played perfectly by Tina Majorino.  She's been in a ton of films, primarily playing a child.  The only one that comes to mind right now is \\"Waterworld.\\"  Kip's internet love comes to visit and she turns out to be an amazonian black beauty who changes his life forever.  Rico still clings to what might have been.<br /><br />The humor of this film is scattered over brief moments in the lives of the aforementioned geeks.  They get beat up, picked on, etc., just like any normal kid who was the outcast in school.  Whether or not you feel guilty for laughing at them, you have to laugh because the best humor is found in the truth, and this film is loaded with that.<br /><br />Highly recommended to folks who are willing to watch this film more than once because you will definitely catch things that you missed before.  It is definitely worthy of multiple viewings.<br /><br />Also, stick around after the credits role to see one of the best moments of the film.

0446310786|5.0|I am a High School senior at D. Russel Lee Career Technology Center in Ohio, and I often look for books that I can find much interest in just by reading a review often located online.  I feel as if I can understand and find interestand info much concerning a book if I read peer reports on it initially, and I am here to add to the numbers. I have found much interest in the timeless novel To Kill a Mocking Bird by Harper Lee.  I originally chose this book due to I have heard discussion circulating all over about it, so I wanted to see what it was about. <br /> <br />If you wish to learn and understand how the southern United States operated in the post Civil War Era you can take a look at a small Alabama town of Maycomb where life appears to be always tranquil but you could not be farther from the truth.  As Harper Lee depicts it, Maycomb is a town quiet to the unseeing eye, but upon closer inspection you will see that anything from innocent child meddling to a town family with a history of misfortune and bad demeanor.  As every town has its own \\"ghost story,\\" Maycomb has a story of a man by the name of Boo Radley.  This name is legend to the children Jem and Scout Finch who are locals neighboring the Radley house.  Throughout the story, these two, with the summerly assistance of their newly acquired friend Dill, attempt to make contact or witness Boo just to influence their curiosity and build their character.  Throughout the course of the story you will hear much of the father, Atticus Finch, being a well known and repected lawyer and seat of the Maycomb County Council, is appointed and must defend a negro man, Tom Robinson, who is accused  of beating and raping Ms. Mayella Ewell. <br /> <br />So if you are interested in the post Civil-War Era involving partial racism and seeming duress, or to witness exploits of children in their seemingly innocent curiosity, or even a court case where sparks and bullets seem to constantly fly, then this is a story for you.   <br /> <br />I would like to take note for future readers that this story contains some harsh language as well as demeaning references to the negro race as well as acts not often seen in everyday life.  I would recommend this excellent novel to anyone any age you begin to read, as long as you take no major offense to the story line and passages containing what I have previously listed above. <br />
B0007P3582|3.0|I see people talkin' about whether or not 50 Cent is a real gangsta. I see folks complaining about the state of commercial rap as if it's all new to them. I see people complaining about 50 Cent \\"dissing\\" Nas and \\"beefin\\" with The Game. Truthfully though, who REALLY cares? Does 50 use beef as a selling point? Yes, but that's not a newsflash either, he came into the rap game on the strength of beef (How To Rob) and went on to sell a gazillion records on his first attempt (Get Rich Or Die Tryin'). Is 50 overrated? Yes. Will he sell anyway? Yes. Does that make this a good album? Not even close.<br /><br />My point: Drama sells. Period. None of this is new to you, so quit acting like it is. If you bought this album in hopes of getting something other than average/mediocre lyrics over hot beats then you're the fool and that's no fault of 50's. Get off of that man's nuts and get a life of your own or at the very least, find a more constructive hobby. There are people like me that don't really care about your opinion of 50 Cent as a person. It's a real pain in the ass trying to fish through the corny reviews just to find the handful that actually talk about the album itself.<br /><br />And now, my review.<br /><br />I have both versions of this album and let me just say that if you bought the regular version instead of the special edition, you're really not missing much. In fact, the collector's edition is a complete rip off. Is the album worthy of 1 star? No. Is it a 5 star album? Not even close. I think another reviewer said it best when they said: \\"50 got rich and stopped trying\\". This album could be considered a remix album instead of a new LP because it's all the same subject matter as the last album with different beats (but are you REALLY surprised by that?). The problem is the fact that these changes aren't for the better. A lot of the production is corny and like I said earlier, all his lyrics have a \\"been there, done that\\" feel to them. That makes about 75% of the album boring.<br /><br />There are moments on the album where 50 turns out some decent material, but they are few and far in between. On \\"In My Hood\\" he manages to make good use of a tight beat from C. Styles & Bang Out. The beats for \\"Candy Shop\\" and \\"Disco inferno\\" are very addictive (even though they're both cheesy). \\"Ski Mask Way\\" has a bangin' beat (supplied by Disco D) and 50 does a decent job (let's be real, 50's lyrical ability was never all that great to begin with). I'm really feeling the \\"Hate It Or Love It\\" remix and DJ Hi Tek laces \\"Ryder Music\\" something lovely.<br /><br />The rest of the album is just your average, formulaic, run-of-the-mill commercial rap. There's the incredibly boring \\"I'm Supposed To Die Tonight\\" which sounds like the remix for \\"Many Men\\" because they're basically the same song. \\"Piggy Bank\\" is probably one of THE weakest diss songs I've ever heard (and I've been listening to rap for a long time now). Honestly, I'd probably lose some respect for Nas if he even bothered to reply to that wack \\"diss\\" track. And when I listen to \\"So Amazing\\" feat. Olivia, I can't help but think about how similar it is to Lil' Flip's \\"Sunshine\\". If you've heard \\"My Buddy\\" from the G Unit album then you've already heard \\"My Toy Soldiers\\" pretty much. \\"I Don't Need 'Em\\" blatantly bites Ghostface's \\"Metal Lungies\\" (Ghost used it way better though). And then there's \\"Gatman & Robbin\\" which is sort of corny. Eminem's production is really becoming predictable and boring. And while Dr. Dre handled a lot of the 1st album's production, he only contributes 2 joints here and they both seem sort of suspect. I expected way hotter production on this album with names like Scott Storch, Dr. Dre, Hi Tek, Cool & Dre, and Disco D on here, but most of it is weak.<br /><br />Truth be told, this album is nothing more than average. Out of 22 joints, I'd have to say that 7 are good. You're going to have 50 Cent groupies that'll tell you this is the best thing since the invention of the wheel.

B000003TA4|3.0|Nevermind is one of the most overrated albums of all time. Yes, this was what got rid of manufactured garbage like Paula Abdul and Color Me Badd. Yes, this is what got MTV's greedy corporate ass to pay attention to indie rock and alternative rock (at least from '91 to '94), and yes, Kurt Cobain was very honorable with his down-to-earth look at celebrity life, as well as his open-mindedness.<br /><br />But is this record a classic? No way. It's a landmark, but not a classic. This may have been the cream of the crop 13 years ago, but trying to pass it off as legendary nowadays is ridiculous. Because so many bands have tried to cop this one's style (specifically trash like Nickelback and Staind), it's almost impossible to hear with fresh ears. Not to mention the slick, big league production is hardly the way Nirvana was supposed to sound; listen to either \\"Bleach\\" or \\"In Utero\\". The raw, stark, dirty, not-so-radio-friendly sound of both albums fits their style of music much better.<br /><br />That being said, \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" is probably one of the only songs that still sounds vital and hard rockin' by todays standards. But it'd still be better to get their other 2 albums instead, just to be sure you're getting the band's absolute best.
B0007O38F8|3.0|I see people talkin' about whether or not 50 Cent is a real gangsta.  I see folks complaining about the state of commercial rap as if it's all new to them.  I see people complaining about 50 Cent \\"dissing\\" Nas and \\"beefin\\" with The Game.  Truthfully though, who REALLY cares?  Does 50 use beef as a selling point?  Yes, but that's not a newsflash either, he came into the rap game on the strength of beef (How To Rob) and went on to sell a gazillion records on his first attempt (Get Rich Or Die Tryin').  Is 50 overrated?  Yes.  Will he sell anyway?  Yes.  Does that make this a good album?  Not even close.<br /><br />My point:  Drama sells.  Period.  None of this is new to you, so quit acting like it is.  If you bought this album in hopes of getting something other than average/mediocre lyrics over hot beats then you're the fool and that's no fault of 50's.  Get off of that man's nuts and get a life of your own or at the very least, find a more constructive hobby.  There are people like me that don't really care about your opinion of 50 Cent as a person.  It's a real pain in the ass trying to fish through the corny reviews just to find the handful that actually talk about the album itself.<br /><br />And now, my review.<br /><br />I have both versions of this album and let me just say that if you bought the regular version instead of the special edition, you're really not missing much.  In fact, the collector's edition is a complete rip off.  Is the album worthy of 1 star?  No.  Is it a 5 star album?  Not even close.  I think another reviewer said it best when they said: \\"50 got rich and stopped trying\\".  This album could be considered a remix album instead of a new LP because it's all the same subject matter as the last album with different beats (but are you REALLY surprised by that?).  The problem is the fact that these changes aren't for the better.  A lot of the production is corny and like I said earlier, all his lyrics have a \\"been there, done that\\" feel to them.  That makes about 75% of the album boring.<br /><br />There are moments on the album where 50 turns out some decent material, but they are few and far in between.  On \\"In My Hood\\" he manages to make good use of a tight beat from C. Styles & Bang Out.  The beats for \\"Candy Shop\\" and \\"Disco inferno\\" are very addictive (even though they're both cheesy).  \\"Ski Mask Way\\" has a bangin' beat (supplied by Disco D) and 50 does a decent job (let's be real, 50's lyrical ability was never all that great to begin with).  I'm really feeling the \\"Hate It Or Love It\\" remix and DJ Hi Tek laces \\"Ryder Music\\" something lovely.<br /><br />The rest of the album is just your average, formulaic, run-of-the-mill commercial rap.  There's the incredibly boring \\"I'm Supposed To Die Tonight\\" which sounds like the remix for \\"Many Men\\" because they're basically the same song.  \\"Piggy Bank\\" is probably one of THE weakest diss songs I've ever heard (and I've been listening to rap for a long time now).  Honestly, I'd probably lose some respect for Nas if he even bothered to reply to that wack \\"diss\\" track.  And when I listen to \\"So Amazing\\" feat. Olivia, I can't help but think about how similar it is to Lil' Flip's \\"Sunshine\\".  If you've heard \\"My Buddy\\" from the G Unit album then you've already heard \\"My Toy Soldiers\\" pretty much.  \\"I Don't Need 'Em\\" blatantly bites Ghostface's \\"Metal Lungies\\" (Ghost used it way better though).  And then there's \\"Gatman & Robbin\\" which is sort of corny.  Eminem's production is really becoming predictable and boring.  And while Dr. Dre handled a lot of the 1st album's production, he only contributes 2 joints here and they both seem sort of suspect.  I expected way hotter production on this album with names like Scott Storch, Dr. Dre, Hi Tek, Cool & Dre, and Disco D on here, but most of it is weak.<br /><br />Truth be told, this album is nothing more than average.  Out of 22 joints, I'd have to say that 7 are good.  You're going to have 50 Cent groupies that'll tellyou this is the best thing since the invention of the wheel.  You'll also have the \\"haters\\" out there that will show no love simply because 50 is who he is.

B000000HTM|5.0|VDGG certainly were NOT your typical Flower-Power kind of band, if anything, quite the opposite. <br /> <br />From start to finish, this is a wild roller-coaster rid e through the depths of the human psyche that many times we're afraid to confront. What's even more striking, in addition to Peter Hammill's unique lyric writing (very deep and oblique at times, informed by science, religion, sci-fi, horror etc), these things are just as much vividly painted by the musicians themselves. <br /> <br />\\"Lemmings (including Cogs)\\" looks headlong at society gone mad and losing touch with its very humanity and opting for machine-like precision and logic as opposed to compassion. Hammill provides the disturbing narrative as Guy Evan's jazz-informed drumming goads it along. Organist/electronics tinkerer Hugh Banton provides appropriately gothic and alternately mysterious atmospheres as saxophonist David Jackson screams out what words cannot.  <br />    <br />\\"Man-Erg\\" - A deceptively rousing song (at the outset) where the protaganist tries to discern who they actually are, looking for identity from within and without and going mad in the process. A pounding, manic middle section just emphasises the struggle all the more.  <br />      <br />\\"Plague of Lighthouse Keepers\\" -  The discs' magnum opus, taken at face value, it seems to be the tale of a lonely lighthouse keeper going mad from the isolation and confronting his own inner demons. Musically, the band pulls out all the stops with one twist and turn after another (it is reputed they NEVER played this live because of the difficulty involved in recreating many of the sounds and making the thorny  transitions between segments). Beginning with a stark echoed electric piano, Hammill parts the curtain for our frightening tale which slowly builds momentum as he goes from thoughtful musing to manic screams.  David Jackson has a field day doing his own unique take on foghorns and seagulls, as Guy Evans handles the chugging passing boats and Hugh BAnton provides the mysterious moonlit and fog-shrouded scenery. From there, the tension mounts as Hammill takes us on a wild ride through the mouth of madness and finally ends with either the protaganist having lost it completely or finding hope, not sure which to be honest. A harrowing but very thrilling musical ride if ever there was one. <br /> <br />The recording quality is a bit echo-drenched at times and sounding a bit of its time (1971) but despite that, has a certain charm to it you wouldn't want removed.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0001AP12G|1.0|Sister 1: I think it's sad that Kanye thinks he's a \\"Christian rapper\\".  His lyrics are AWFUL! Can he honestly believe God is behind songs that swear every other sentence? Now I'm not to judge, but it puts a bad name on the Christians who listen to fulfilling music.  If he really wants to be a messenger, sing pure music!  The beats, though, are fun, but I find this CD a total waste of my time.<br /><br />Sister 2: Once I heard the CD I thought to myself, \\"He's a Christian?\\" I think it's terrible to spread God's word in such a wretched manner. I agree with Sister 1 that the beats are off the heazy. His purpose is noble, but his lyrics are not worthy of listening to. This really IS NOT a CD I would reccomend to those who pay attention to the lyrics.  Nice try Kanye, but next time, read the Bible!
B000005H7D|5.0|This is the classic recording by tenor saxophonist, legend, John Coltrane. The one that put him on the map. He had a couple of good session dates before this one, but it wasn't until Trane released Blue Train, that people saw that, after being a vitol member in the Miles Davis Quintet, he could go out on his own, and make pivitol recordings.  <br /> <br />He beautifully demonstrates his big huge warm style here, and with the help of his cohorts, Lee Morgan, a growing trumpet figure, on trumpet, Curtis Fuller, on trombone, the underrated Kenny Drew, on piano, one of the most recorded jazz bassits of all time, Paul Chambers, and the legendary Philly Joe Jones, on the drums.  <br /> <br />The cd, of course, opens up with the classic, Blue Train. Trane arranged all the horn parts pretty well, as every horn man is playing in a different key. Good harmonies!!! Moments Notice, is such a beautiful song, and Lazy Bird is great.  <br /> <br />Coltrane plays great with Lee Morgan and Curtis Fuller. They all blend and match eachother beautifully. This was a classic recording 45 years ago, and it still is today. Coltrane will go down in the book, for being one of the most important saxophone figures, in jazz, of all time! <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|This one of the best albums I have ever listed to ever. Every song is great in its own way. The only song i really didnt like was Extrodinary Girl it got a little to poppy for me.My personal favorite was Jesus of Surburbia. If u havent already bought then wtf are you waiting for go and get it.
B000000Y27|5.0|Wes Montgomery. The world's greatest jazz guitarist. Many copied his octive style that made him so unique. He played all of this, even at killer tempos, and only used his thumb!  <br /> <br />In my opinion, this was Wes Montgomery's first real important album. He displays everything here. His big swinging sense, his thumb technique and the beautiful octive sound.  <br /> <br />This is the epitome of great jazz guitar. Wes, himself, the virtososo he was, played all of these tunes with such ease. If he was alive today, and was making these wonderful recordings, I'd be out getting all those great albums.  <br /> <br />Wes does a great job covering Sonny Rollins' Airegin, my favorite Sonny Rollins composition of all. Wes even does a great job at Gone With The Wind. Perhaps only Dave Brubeck's version can compare.  <br /> <br />There is no irony in the title of this album. And if anyone has any doubt about that, just listen to this album. Wes displays it all here.  <br />
068987474X|3.0|When we sat down to write our new book, Always Talk to Strangers: Three Simple Steps to Finding the Love of Your Life, we had one thing in mind-to get men and women back on the same page when it came to meeting each other. As a dating agent who actually works with men and women on a daily basis, as opposed the inexperienced authors of chick lit that have become bestsellers, nothing frustrated David more than hearing women talk about the mind games they think they must play to get a man's attention. Women, let this serve as a wakeup call. There is no mind game, rule, or trick that can make a man truly fall for you. You've been sold a bill of goods!  <br /> <br />In famous books like The Rules and He's Just Not that Into You, the authors espouse the coy technique, i.e., the more you act like you don't care about a guy, the more he'll fall for you. Is it true? The answer-a resounding no. So why does this technique seem to work so often? The reason-men are not falling in love with you, they're falling in love with your unavailability. Most people are attracted to things they can't have. If someone acts like they don't need you or want you, or that they are unattainable, suddenly they become a challenge. This is Psychology 101. Think about it. How much would you love the guy you have a crush on if instead of him being a challenge, he was staring at you all day, enamored, completely at your beckon call, worshiping your every word and move. Might be fun for a while, but eventually you'd lose interest in him?  <br /> <br />The problem for most women who use the \\"coy\\" technique comes when you they can longer keep up the emotionally unavailable charade. At some point they have to let down their guard, be themselves, become vulnerable, and see if the man accepts them for who they are or see if he heads for the door. Most of the time if a man is not ready for a relationship, or a woman is no longer emotionally unavailable, he's heading for the door.  <br /> <br />Contrary to popular belief, men are not one dimensional creatures. Most men don't simply sit around with their friends grunting and burping like Neanderthals. As a matter of fact, you'd probably be surprised to know that most men talk very openly with their friends about their feelings toward women, about love, and about their emotions. In addition, most men are very aware of their own issues with intimacy and commitment, and most of the time they know when they are ready to confront these issues, and make a go of it with a woman.  <br /> <br />Ladies, here is what you need to know, and all ye ever need to know if you're going to have a meaningful substantive relationship with any man. First, you must have good conversation, must enjoy each other's company, and must connect on a spiritual and intellectual level. Second, you must have physical attraction. Attraction is subjective and it can't be forced, no matter what your other dating book says. Third, both of you must be ready to attempt intimacy and commitment with one another. For both men and women, this comes at different times in life. Some people are ready for long term intimacy and commitment at eighteen, some at forty-eight, and some are never capable of it, or are simply not willing to do the work that it takes to achieve it. Fourth, you both must be willing to accept that love is not just about being hot and bothered for one another. In all relationships where two people are both emotionally and physically available to one another, initial feelings of passionate lust eventually wear off. This happens at different times depending on the couple. When this happens, you begin to regain part of your identity and it's at this point where the real work of a relationship begins. Often, this work is called love.  <br /> <br />Stop looking for easy answers to life's most complex and challenging issues. There is no mind game that will bring you real satisfaction and a lifetime of fulfillment. Instead of trying to figure out waysto manipulate men into loving you, spend time becoming the best person you can be and get proactive with your dating life. Meet as many men as possible until you find a natural meaningful connection with someone who is also willing to make a real attempt at intimacy and commitment. Believe me, they are out there. However, this much I guarantee-as long as you stereotype men and underestimate their intelligence and their complexity, you will never find a meaningful experience with one. And as long as you continue to buy into pop theories of attraction, you will continually be chasing your own tail.  <br /> <br />David Wygant and Bryan Swerling are the authors of the new book, Always Talk to Strangers: Three Simple Steps to Finding the Love of Your Life(Penguin Group/Perigee)  <br />
044024157X|5.0|I have read and enjoyed all of John Grisham's books, but I reserve a special place in my heart for the ones that give me not only a good story, but also a good belly laugh.  This one was good for not one gut-buster, but two!   I haven't laughed this hard since the boathouse scene in \\"The Client\\".  Tears were literally falling to the page.  Call me warped, but I find at least one scene in every Grisham book to be extremely funny.  To find two was indeed a pleasure.  Read this if you are already a Grisham fan, or if you simply want to be entertained by a good story with memorable characters. Enjoy !
B00005ATQD|5.0|This is definetley one of Tom Cruise  <br />and Nicole Kidman's best films ever. <br />Outstanding performance's by both of them. <br />I want to correct a viewer who said <br />it's not about sex,well you're wrong. <br />Why do you think during the movie Tom's  <br />character name Bill had so many chances <br />to cheat on Allison his wife in the movie. <br />But he was so in love with his wife and <br />has had thought about having sex with <br />all the women in the movie but he loves <br />her so much he can't do it.My favorite <br />part in the movie is when he goes to the <br />house where all the naked women and people <br />in costumes having sex with each other are.It's <br />like having sex with a hooker but you don't  <br />have to pay at this house. <br /> <br />Through out the movie Bill day dreams and <br />wonders if his wife really did cheat on him <br />and if she was also at the house of sex,is what <br />I call it when he was there.But the big twist <br />is at the end but I'm not telling you what <br />happened. <br /> <br />Outstanding sex scenes from both Nicole <br />and Tom. <br /> <br />All movies like this one need to have <br />more sex scenes,this is a must see  <br />and own movie on DVD.If you like alot <br />of nudity and sex scenes this movie  <br />is for you. <br />
0393317552|5.0|If all men are created equal, then why are some cultures so much more technologically and economically advanced than others? <br /> <br />Racists have always made me feel uneasy becuase, while I have never been impressed by their attitudes, I have also felt powerless to change them. <br /> <br />This book was my first exposure to an explanation of cultural inequity founded -- ultimately -- on something other than race. <br /> <br />If your tribe lives in a land with a mild climate and fertile soil, with plants and animals that can be domesticated, you will do better over time than a tribe that lives in a less favorable place.  If your society is geographically isolated, you will be invaded less (and thus have less incentive to invent new technologies to defend yourself), but you will also have fewer opportunities to trade goods and knowledge: your society will progress more slowly than one more exposed to (and connected to) others. <br /> <br />I am not a cultural anthropologist nor am I a serious student of social issues, so I cannot comment on the sholarly worthiness of this book.   <br /> <br />However, as a curious layman, I found this to be an extraordinarily illuminating book, not least as a commentary on the the overwhelming influence of context on outcomes. <br />
B0006U4UAU|5.0|All around badass dance sh*t with brains that's more disco-punk than it is rock (check the glitter-ball cover). A funktastic opener sets things off, and with an opening track chorus of \\"Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house!\\" sounding the call, I knew I was in store for indie-dance with a bit more integrity than your typical wannabe new-wave revivalist. From butt-shaking rockers to slow burning dance-floor crooners to punk thrash-outs, electro blips against disco licks, this is all around stellar material that actually attempts to explore the sonic possibilities of a rock/disco/electronic/funk conglomeration as much as it pays homage to the heavyweight stylings of the past. Dance-punk, electro-clash, whatever the hell you want to call it, let it be known that LCD Soundsystem might just be the best thing to come out of the current retro-trend yet. <br />
B00005JNQQ|2.0|I went to see this movie \\"Robots\\" last night with my friend Michael (please see our review for \\"The Polar Express\\").  After ten minutes, I found myself unable to get comfortable in what normally would be a very comfortable seat. At first, I couldn't figure out why. Michael didn't look my way with a smile even ONCE during this film -- in fact, he spent almost the entire movie slumped down in his seat, a stunned expression on his face (what I imagine a shell-shocked soldier must look like). In other words, he looked like I felt.<br /><br />On the way home, in the darkness of my car, the two of us were  completely silent --- RELISHING the silence. I finally spoke up and said, \\"Hope you don't mind my silence!\\"  Michael said, \\"No, it's okay. That was noisy!\\"  We didn't say another word until I dropped Michael off at the L'Arche home where he lives with five other residents and three assistants - all of whom had been sitting down to dinner when we were leaving -- wishing Michael a \\"good time at the movies\\" and me a happy birthday (just turned 58).<br /><br />----<br /><br />This is a film without silences -- the 'polar opposite' you might say, of \\"The Polar Express\\" which uses silences the way a great composer or jazz musician does -- that innate sense of taste or the knowledge that . . . what you leave OUT is often as important as what you leave in.  \\"Robots\\" must surely have had moments of silence - but in the aftermath (my ears are still ringing) I can't recall them.<br /><br />My all-time favorite comedian Robin Williams likes to coin two-word phrases (describing, for instance a Southern dialect as \\"having a vowel movement\\"). With Robin in mind I hereby mint one of my own, to describe this movie: 'Ear rape.'<br /><br />---<br /><br />If you are a mother with children, the analogy I would offer you is this: Imagine spending over an hour and a half locked in a room with noisy -- REALLY noisy -- toys that you cannot shut off.<br /><br />If you are a working man, imagine being trapped for an hour and a half in a really noisy environment (think foundry or steel mill).<br /><br />Prediction:  This movie - far from becoming a `classic' - will have a very short shelf life. I cannot imagine - if you see this on the big screen, (with volume levels you cannot control) ever wanting to see it on your home TV screen --- even with the sound turned low.<br /><br />Come to think of it, I might watch this movie for its visuals, with the sound turned off . . . my favorite music playing in the foreground, (and perhaps some intoxicant in my veins). I believe under such controlled circumstances I could handle seeing this movie again.  The unrelenting body humor (machines losing arms and legs -- `slapstick' is what we older folks used to call this) eventually strikes most everyone as funny.<br /><br />And the five minute roll of credits at the movie's end (Michael and I always stay to watch the credits and are always the only ones left in the theatre) credit hundreds of no-doubt talented people who may have worked hard to make this a VISUAL treat.<br /><br />But you know what? The funniest bit of animation isn't a part of the movie proper: It's five minutes of animated fun BEFORE \\"Robots\\" begins.<br /><br />Remember the little \\"Ice Age\\" creature we've seen before? -- the tiny, grey, sort of combination cat and fox (and something else) delivers its own brand of agonizing humor:  It hangs upside down to an ice-covered outcropping, clinging by its fingernails (even by its tongue, frozen to the ice) . . .  risking death-by-falling-into-an-abyss - just to retrieve its ACORN!

0316172324|3.0|About three years ago, I read an article in \\"The New Yorker\\" about microexpressions.  They're these fleeting and nearly imperceptible expressions that cross a person's face so quickly that the average observer can only see them if you slow down recorded images. <br /> <br />These expressions cannot be consciously controlled, and they betray your true feelings.   (The mental image I particularly remember from this article is of normally mild-faced Kato Kaelin snarling at Marcia Clark during the OJ Simpson trial for a split second.  You don't remember seeing that, do you?  Me neither.)   <br /> <br />The weird thing is that, after enough practice, you can learn to see those microexpressions.   <br /> <br />The possibilities!  If I could see microexpressions, I could have the world trembling at my feet!  I could become what amounted to a mindreader. <br /> <br />Since I'm not really a megalomaniac, that feeling subsided, and I hadn't thought about that article much until recently.   <br /> <br />But now I've read \\"Blink\\" by Malcolm Gladwell (also the author of that microexpression story in \\"The New Yorker,\\" also the author of \\"The Tipping Point\\") and have spent some time thinking about what can take place in a split second. <br /> <br />Among other things, Gladwell looks at various marketing successes (like the Aeron chair, first saddled with the moniker \\"The Chair of Death\\" due to its perceived aesthetic shortcomings, now you're probably sitting in one (or a knock-off of one) as you read this) and failures (like New Coke) and compares how these decisions were made. <br /> <br />In order to make a good rapid decision, it's necessary that you know (instinctively) what information to accept and what information to discard when you're being bombarded by too much of it. <br /> <br />It seems that it goes pretty much like this: if you already know a great deal about the subject at hand, you're pretty good at making quick judgments about something.   <br /> <br />If you haven't been trained, had a lot of experience, or practiced, well, then it's likely that you're not very good at it. <br /> <br />In other words, if you aren't looking at exactly the right variables, you might end up making a colossal mistake.  And how can you determine what those variables are?  Well...by knowing through experience. <br /> <br />Although sometimes you do just know. <br /> <br />There's a lot going on in your brain that you simply aren't aware of-you might instinctively act one way without being aware of your reasoning for it until afterwards. <br /> <br />It's also important to note that there are a lot of variables over which you have little or no control when it comes to making a judgment in a snap.   <br /> <br />Like it or not, each of us has prejudices, and they're difficult to abandon when you're in a situation where you're making a decision very quickly.   <br /> <br />All of these subjects are covered in great detail in the book, both the cheery and the dark sides of rapid cognition.   <br /> <br />Here's what Gladwell says are the tasks of his book: <br /> <br />1. To convince us that decisions made quickly can be as good as those made deliberately <br />2. To flag the reasons that our instincts can mislead us <br />3. To convince us that our snap judgments can be controlled <br /> <br />Does he succeed on all points?  Well...yes and no. <br /> <br />When I started this book, I admit that I was seized by the same kind of excitement as I was while reading about microexpressions.  (My productivity will increase!  No bad decisions again!) <br /> <br />After reading \\"Blink,\\" I'm convinced that my snap decisions can sometimes be as good as my most careful ones.  And sometimes not.   <br /> <br />I do see why my instincts can mislead me at times. <br /> <br />And, I am convinced that my snap judgments can be controlled.  Up to a point.  <br /> <br />However, if you're looking for Gladwell to teach you how to \\"thin-slice\\" and make great quick decisions, if you're looking for him to teach you how to control your snap judgments, you won't find that in this book. <br /> <br />What Gladwell does do is unload a quick succession of stories and research that loosely interweave to form a book that is chockablock interesting material.   <br /> <br />\\"Blink\\" is nothing if it isn't entertaining, and if you're intrigued by the complex inner workings of the human mind, it is a book worth reading.   <br /> <br />But if you're interested in takeaways beyond thought and theory, your time might be better spent researching your decisions instead. <br /> <br />
0385510454|2.0|I am a Grisham fan however this one I am offended by.  If Mr. Grisham wants to take a vacation he should take it on his own dime.  And to Mr. Grisham I say, remember the fiction writer's cardinal rule, if it doesn't move the story forward LEAVE IT OUT.  In my opinion, most of this should have been left on the editing floor. <br /> <br />J.C. Anderson
B000069AUI|5.0|I first started listening to this CD mid 2003. I had always been a rap kind of guy, when I say rap, I mean NOTHING but rap.              This CD completely changed my music taste, after listening to this CD over and over and over again I discovered that there is no point in listening to rap ever. A Rush of Blood to the Head opened a whole world of music to me and I owe it all to Coldplay.       After a few months I discovered that this is my favorite CD in the whole world. I loved it so much I even made my screen name in direct reference to this CD because it had such a tremendous impact on my music taste. I can hardly explain the way it makes me feel. I can best describe as a mixture of relaxation and intense exitement that always lifts my spirits no matter what the case.       \\"Amsterdam\\" is probably one of the best songs written in the history of music, and by far the most under-rated song on the entire CD.     A MUST OWN FOR MUSIC APPRECIATORS
1884737994|5.0|As a rookie, I first checked out the second edition Zinn from the local public library - it taught me the basics of adjusting the limit screws on my derailleur and how to replace spokes on my rigid frame mountain bike.<br /><br />After 10 years of riding in Marin CA, I now have a dual suspension mountain bike.  These bikes are expensive and  complicated with a lot more things to break and adjust.  I now own a third edition copy of Zinn and am glad to have it.  It is a good owners manual.  The book provides guidance for things I can do and things I am better off not doing.  Even when I can't do something I like to know how it works.<br /><br />The book provides an added level of safety in getting riders familiar with their bikes and providing guidelines for evaluating if things are worn out and what a good replacement schedule is for parts.  Unavoidable things in life include death and taxes, mountain biking adds a concept 'everything will break at some point' and when it does you want to be able to consult Zinn.<br /><br />The book is nicely indexed and is set-up in easily understood sections that will allow you to handle specific problems you are having with your bike.  Explanations are concise and there are a lot of pictures and figures of various models of equipment.  Fun to read even if you don't work on your own bike, and allows you to save some $ if you do.
B000669GAI|5.0|This is an excellent collection.  Nirvana was the first of the Grunge bands to reach the masses but I feel Pearl Jam was the best of the lot though I have had moments when I felt Alice in Chains was the best. Hell, I feel there the best band from the 90's period. This is almost like a soundtrack of my 20's as so many of the songs bring back so many good memories when I hear them.  I miss the grunge days.  All of Pearl Jams best known songs are here.  Although, there last few releases did not get alot of publicity there are still some solid songs from \\"no code\\", \\"yield\\" and \\"riot act\\" on here. Plus you get non-album tracks and soundtrack tunes like \\"State of Love and Trust\\" and \\"Breath\\". Would have been nice for \\"Porch\\" and \\"Glorified G\\" to have been included but with so many great songs to pick from they all couldn't be included.  The remixed versions of \\"Alive\\" and \\"Black\\"(My personal favorite) sound great.  The differences are very subtle, just enough so you notice.  Overall this is a great compilation and for the price you can't beat it.
B00068CVJ4|5.0|I don't write many reviews, but I had to give you my two cents...This album will blow you away!!  I'll admit that this was my first ATDI album but what an intro!  The vocals are raw the guitars are crunching and the drums don't let up.  It's fast and will hit you like a punch in the face...get it now!
B000001FS3|5.0|This is one of those CDs that seems to get better with age. U2 had put out some good albums before.  The earlier ones had some great songs surrounded by filler. I feel this is the first complete album they released.  We all know the hits from this release \\"With of Without You\\", \\"Where the STreets Have No Name\\", and \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" but there are some really great songs hidden in here.  The chorus to \\"Red Hill Mining Town\\" still gives me chills.  \\"One Tree Hill\\" and \\"Gods Country\\" are songs that just make you feel really good.  \\"Running To Stand Still\\" should have been a hit single, don't know what happened there.  \\"Bullett the Blue Sky\\" just rocks.  Excellent.

0515127485|4.0|I was very skeptical when I was starting this book, but it proved to be a very good entertainment indeed. The story is very good and by the end one would realize that pieces do fit perfectly well. While one would not expect from a thriller to be authentic, but it is actually pretty authentic and gives a pretty good sense of the place. It is hard to believe it but the author even invented an original swearing in Russian style. Naturally, there are some minor problems but, who does not have them?
B00005JNBQ|2.0|This movie came highly recommended to me.  It was not the worst movie I have seen, and I did sit through the entire flick.  However, Napoleon and his bunch were much too flat.  If it was only Napoleon that was deadpan, then the quirkiness of the others may have worked. The uncle was the only interesting character.  About the only nice thing I can say is that Napoleon put forth a fairly accurate portrayal of a student with Asperger syndrome that also has some serious emotional issues.  He should have been picked on more at school for the film to be accurate.  I may use a scene from this movie when presenting on Autistic Spectrum Disorder because Rain Man was so overrated.  As one reviewer suggested to me, \\"This movie grows on you.\\"  I doubt it, but only time will tell.   If you want offbeat comedy, try Office Space instead.
B000000W5B|5.0|I have heard a few songs from this disk and new them well.<br /><br /> I have been rebuilding my Stones collection again and finally got to hear this all the way from begining to end. WOW!!! I have never been so taken by surprise if you like the Rolling Stones this will blow you away. I think every song is good at the least.you can put this on and let it go.Dancing with Mr.D starts it off in true stones fashion,then 100 years keeps it going. a classic Keith tune coming down again , calms things down.<br /><br />Then up we go again with Heartbreaker into angie and not to mention hide your love and winter. silver train, can you hear and star are great tunes also. I love this disk and would say buy it if you don't have it. you cannot go wrong , I may even buy a few for some friends. My own take is there are a lot of good Stones albums this is truly one of the best and most overlooked.I personally did not care for Exile on main street but I loved Let it bleed and Some Girls. BUY IT ,ITS PHENOMENAL!! THE GREATEST ROCK 'N\\" ROLL BAND EVER..
B00005JNQQ|5.0|John Lasseter must be really worried about now.  Pixar has had a straight run of 6 for 6 hits. That 'Cars' has been pushed back to next year may point to problems - although with their high standards and willingness to go back to the storyboard, I'm not worried.  However, Robots is the first film to truly compete with Pixar's output in both visual and script terms. <br />Dreamworks had Shrek and its sequel (which were pretty good) and then disappointed terribly with the appauling Shark Tale - visually their next (Madagascar) looks undercooked.  Even Pixar's weakest (arguably A Bugs Life) is still excellent (and beat Dreamworks Antz on all levels).  <br />By these standards Fox looked like a rank outsider.  Ice Age was good but pretty fogettable and didn't rival any of the other studios on design while the story smelled a little too much like that of Monsters Inc.  This all has lead to Robots being the biggest animated surprise in a good few years.  We all knew that The Incredibles would be good - Robots hits you right between the eyes when you're not looking! <br />The design is fantastic and beautifully rendered.  Its entire universe has been created from the imagination and is stunning.  Robot City is a vista that takes away the breath!  <br />Also taking away the breath are the numerous expertly handled set-pieces.  The city's pubic transportation system gives us our best moments with a staggeringly intricate journey from the station to BigWeld Industries.  Also amazing are the domino sequence and the genuinely exciting climax. Another particular favourite moment of mine was the fight over a foot that ends up as a wonderfully choreographed ballet. <br />The voice talent is uniformly good. Robin Williams obviously steals the show but, since his character is pretty incidental, isn't allowed to upstage the action.  <br />The script is tight and works on all levels - from in-jokes to fart gags - with a good message that isn't rammed down the audiences' throats.  Laugh-out-loud funny! <br />Overall a recommendation for any and every age group (my 3 year old was spell-bound) and an announcement that the bar has officially been raised. This will get my bet for next year's Animated Oscar!
B00008DDXC|4.0|The first movie \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" made a bucket load of cash for Warner Bros. and established itself as an even bigger franchise for motion pictures than the series of books had for the world of literature. A mere twelve months later and the whole gang came back for more of the same brand of excitement and childlike wonder that made the first movie such a treat.<br /><br />Amidst word that the cast may call it quits after the third movie and the sad passing of actor Richard Harris, the supercharging \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" proved that you just cannot keep a good  pre-adolescent student wizard down.<br /><br />The first installment of the series suffered from the necessary need to set up the backstory and introduce the characters. It's much the same problem that hampered the recent adaptation of \\"Spiderman.\\" The second chapter in the Potter series therefore is able to jump straight into the action, and action is something the movie certainly provides from a nerve wrenching, white knuckle quidditch game to a battle royal at the end between Harry and a giant monster, this movie never seems to stop moving.<br /><br />Yes, the truth be told \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" is a far superior movie to its earlier incarnation. I have never read the books, but one can only guess that J.K. Rowling's confidence and skill had markedly improved following the success of her first novel. This adventure really seems to have some solid plotting behind it, with not only an intriguing and compelling mystery but also a more sinister and satisfying villain.<br /><br />Of course the true villain of the piece is not unmasked until the final reel, along the way we are dealt with the standard red herrings and the impossible bumbling Kenneth Branagh who seems to have a lot of fun playing  with his quasi-celebrity status.<br /><br />Across campus the students (and some of the animals) of Hogwart's are turning up petrified.  Among the suspects at the school is Harry himself and the faculty fear that an unspeakable terror may have returned to the school after a 50-year absence,imself and the faculty fear that an unspeakable terror may have returned to the school after a 50-year absence,
B00005ATQF|5.0|I recently saw this movie and I have to say that it's a very intresting view of what goes on throughout a soilder's career from boot camp to combat. <br /> <br />I also really liked the performance by R. Lee Ermey(anyone who watches \\"Mail Call\\" On The History Channel knows who this is) as the tough Gunnery Sargent and I though that it was a very good performance. <br /> <br />All in all, I have to say that this is a good movie and I highly recommend it.
B00005JLR2|4.0|It must have seemed like a good idea on paper. Take a much loved childrens classic like \\"Treasure Island\\" and update it with a good splash of \\"Star Wars.\\" Get the same guys that produced previous hits like \\"Aladdin\\" and \\"The Little Mermaid\\" and surely the result will be a winner.<br />Well, not entirely.<br />I went into the latest Walt Disney animated movie \\"Treasure Planet\\" really wanting to love it. I grew up just an hour away from Edinburgh and many times passed the island in the center of that city which, the tourist brochures tell us, served as an inspiration for Robert Louis Stevenson's \\"Treasure Island\\".<br />The mesh of classic literature and science fiction does occasionally create a magical moment when you are left saying to yourself \\"wow, now that was cool,\\" but during too many instances in that movie theater I found myself wondering what I should pick up for dinner or, more telling, what this movie could have been, should have been.<br />It's novel to have the space ships in this production based on the design of the galleons that cruised the seas during Stevenson's time, complete with sails to capture the suns energy rather than the wind. It was interesting to see the character of Long John Silver turned into a cyborg with a shape shifter on his shoulder instead of a parrot.<br />The rogues galley of aliens and a robot that owes more than a casual nod to C-3PO also add color to this production, but it really is a mixed bag.<br />The story is so well known that it seems almost unnecessary to produce here. Young, adventurous and impetuous Jim Hawkins dreams of escaping the dreary life he leads and sailing the open sea, errr, I mean space. Then one night he rescues a dying traveler who has on his person a treasure map. Following his dreams he embarks on an adventure across the universe in search of untold wealth.<br />This movie may be fun for the kids - which I guess was the target audience for this production, but adults would be better served throwing the newly remastered DVD of \\"Bambi\\" into the DVD player.VD of \\"Bambi\\" into the DVD player.
0024181900|5.0|There was a time when I hated The Elements of Style. It had been forced upon me by a series of crusty old English teachers and I recoiled and grumbled every time I saw it. In time, much to my surprise, I discovered how helpful this book could be and I found myself seeking its guidance more and more often.<br /><br />I have been out of school for years now but I still treasure my copy of The Elements of Style, keeping it within arms reach on my desk at home, along with my dictionary, thesaurus, and Chicago Manual of Style. I read it once a year. This slim book I once considered insufferable is now invaluable to me.<br /><br />Although it is not as comprehensive as the massive Chicago Manual of Style, The Elements of Style has far more soul, humor, and wisdom in a far shorter space. It covers all the basics -- punctuation and usage, composition, form, and frequently misused words and expressions. The final chapter offers stylistic counsel to anyone brave enough to tackle the challenge of writing well. These are deceptively simple platitudes such as \\"Do not overwrite,\\" \\"Be clear,\\" and \\"Write in a way that comes naturally.\\" White calls these his \\"articles of faith\\" and his advice is practical and priceless.<br /><br />The Elements of Style is a classic whose value has been proven through time and through countless testimonials. And yes, I must admit, those crusty old English teachers were right after all.
B000002IGP|5.0|This record has BALLS.  Don't bother with it if you don't.  I can't imagine what kind of man could actually look Robin Crosby in the eye when he was at the top of his game, but he would have to have been one hell of a man.
B0007M22TI|3.0|The leads' voices are indeed angelic and incomparable, solo and united. The music selection is also quite worthy of this title. But the general audio mix leaves a lot to be desired. At best, it is unwieldy, with the orchestra and back-up choir frequently overpowering and smothering the lead(s). Visually, the mix is similar. The cameras seem to spend much more time on the support element (orch and choir) than the leads, with harsh fades between the two. The strength and high quality of the lead voices is what brings this production out of the basement.
0441172717|5.0|In Dune the author Frank Herbert used 3rd person omniscient. He shares the perspectives, thoughts, and feelings of multiple characters. Frank Herbert uses symbolism as a literary device. One of the symbols he uses in the book is water. The Fremen refer to blood as \\"the body's water,\\" suggesting that the Fremen view water as the blood of the environment. When Thufir Hawat agrees to join the Fremen, he enters the \\"bond of water,\\" rather than a blood oath. People show their loyalty to one another by spitting or sharing water. Paul and Jessica, during their time with the Fremen, engage in many rituals that involve water. For example, Paul accepts the water of Jamis's corpse after he kills him. After drinking the water, Paul is baptized into the culture of the Fremen, and he is reborn as a leader in their world. For the Fremen, water and life are the same.  <br /> <br />One of the themes Frank Herbert uses in the book is religion and power. Religion represents a source of comfort and power throughout the novel. Paul pursues the same goals as Kynes, but uses his religious power over the Fremen as their messiah to gain control of the entire Imperium. Paul possesses mystical abilities that go above and beyond a simple heightened awareness or intelligence, but his clever exploitation of religion is his most powerful advantage. Paul's manipulation of religion and the calculated use of legends contrived by the Bene Gesserit allow him to rise to the position of emperor. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes science-fiction and fantasy.  <br /> <br />
B0002OERI0|1.0|They forgot the \\"S\\" at the end of the album name. These guys are prime examples of \\"American Idiots\\".  What I find the most humourous about this type of \\"Anti-propoganda\\" music is that it IS PROPOGANDA..
B00004SZWD|5.0|Ah, Songs in the Key of Life! Mention the name Stevie Wonder to the average person on the street and there's a good chance that within a few seconds they'll be telling you how much they love this album.  And it is a great album indeed.  Stevie Wonder is one of the greatest composers in popular music history and his brilliance is vividly illustrated througout this CD.  'Sir Duke', Stevie's tribute to Duke Ellington who is also one of the greatest composers in the history of music is a rapturous tune that has the loose feel of an old 1940's jazz record but totally \\"Wonderfied\\":-).  \\"I Wish\\" is a vivacious funk jam with Stevie blessing us with vocals that could normally only be heard in deep southern churches on Sunday mornings.  The beautiful \\"Knocks Me Off My Feet\\" is impeccably constructed and Stevie's sense of melody here is downright heavenly.  I could go on and on, and as great as this album is, it is a little bloated.  In its defense, every double album that I have ever heard is a little bloated, and this is definitely one of the top three double albums ever made.  But, as brilliant as each album that I would put in the top three is, they are all a little bloated, so in no way is that criticism directed just at Stevie.  And even though this album does sprawl a little, its sprawl kind of adds to its overall charm.  There are several songs that somehow turn into 7 minute jam sessions on this CD, but Stevie is such a great composer and he was so on top of his game that you hardly even notice.  I find myself listening to \\"Joy Inside My Tears\\" and wondering why the song ended so soon.  This album is definitely essential for your collection, but if you're looking for this genius' best work, take it from me, \\"Talking Book\\" and \\"Innervisions\\" are even better. \\"Music of my Mind\\" and \\"Fullfillingness' First Finale\\" are almost as good and are just as essential.  Stevie Wonder has a whole lot more to offer than just this wonderful album and/or various greatest hits compilations.  Don't be afraid to dig deeper into this genius' catalog.  The rewards reaped will be phenomenal. Sayonara!
068484267X|5.0|i've read this (and 'tis) with great pleasure, and obviously so have lots of others.  to the small numbers who are offended or put off - just remember, all memoirs are the author's memory.  in this case a memory of life before adulthood.<br /><br />if you remember your own childhood, especially if you have lots of family around to dispute your memory, you'll think twice about focusing on fact vs fiction.<br /><br />and the facts are that until the recent past, ireland was among the poorest lands in europe and one where the only opportunities were abroad.

B000002UAU|3.0|I know about 30 to 40% of the beatle's fans will argue tooth and nail, but Abbey Road is a lot better as a whole than this classic. Yes it is a classic and still probably the best record of that year. The song writing (as always) is 5 star to say the least. In 1967 it was a landmark and damn well should have been. I look at the Beatles and think what songs I like and go from there. They were never a band to put out and entire album of great songs. They were a singles band. As ambitious as this effort was, it falls short. If you are a Beatles nut, I can see how you think this is the apex of all recordings. If you really listen to this record you will find how sloppy it was recorded. With all that said I am still glad I have a copy of this
B0007DAZW8|5.0|You know just the other day I was fantasizing about a brand new Daft Punk studio album and today while perusing the record store I found it with 'Human After All'.That being the case I was expecting a record with alot of music with the heavy 70's and 80's R&B and electro funk references on 2001's 'Discovery',<br /><br />only taken to the next level.Only on the way home listening on the car CD player did I realize that this is a very different kind of album in that the two men in the group have picked up electric guitars now.Therefore the musical influences here are more in 70's and 80's light punk and new wave.In fact parts of it I would describe as punk-house such as the opening title track,\\"Technologic\\" and the heavy handed \\"The Brainwasher\\" as having the insistant rhythm of classic new wave and of course those spikey new wave synthesizer's.Of course Daft Punk add some of their own kind of signiture style into many of the songs.Namely among them are the single \\"Robot Rock\\"-a fierce funk-rock beat merged with a great synth solo and guitar riff.<br /><br />\\"The Prime Of Your Life\\" actually has a very strong vocal hook and is married to a great shuffling rhythm.\\"Make Love\\" harkens back to the slower R&B type grooves of their last CD while \\"Steam Machine\\" and \\"Emotion\\" have a strong underlying ambient quality to them.\\"Television Rules The Nation\\" brings up a medium tempo dance beat with a smugly humerous lyric tag.<br /><br />  So that explains the music of 'Human After All',so why all the bad reviews I see here?None of Daft Punk's three studio albums have been anything alike-1997's 'Homework' sounded like a set of sound experiments that succeeded beyond the wildest expectations,'Discovery' refined and worked at perfecting the sound and this album finds this pair of DJ's having finally developed a fully realized sound and,for once actually having a better idea of how to run the equiptment they're using-unlike the first two albums you won't here any random knob switching or<br /><br />major sound mistakes here-the sound is still experimental and innovative but alot more professional.And any fans who insist on tossing this CD aside now sound give this now brand new CD some time to settle into the mind.And then I imagine it will be sure to please the ear.r <br />major sound mistakes here-the sound is still experimental and innovative but alot more professional.And any fans who insist on tossing this CD aside now sound give this now brand new CD some time to settle into the mind.And then I imagine it will be sure to please the ear. <br /> <br />
B00005JN4H|4.0|I must confess, this is the first of Queen Latifah's movies I've watched.  I dunno why, but I was convinced I didn't care for her as an actor.  I was wrong.    Latifah plays Belle, an adrenalin addicted cab driver who's anxious to begin her career as a NYC cabbie in her souped up Ford Crown Victoria, yet despite her female macho outer shell, she's really a romantic softie at heart.  Her character, despite being larger then life (come on... how many overweight black females actually ride as a bike courier in NYC?) is also not the typical paper-thin, one dimensional empty shell that so many comedy roles are.  And her role perfectly complements the male lead.    Jimmy Fallon plays police detective Washburn, and he does such a fantastic job of playing a pathetic little dweeb of a cop that more then once I wanted Latifah to pound his skinny little a@@. The comedy kicks in when Washburn, who drives worse then a 90 year old grandma, looses his license and gets a demotion.  He manages to hook up with Belle and her crown vic, and together the two unwilling partners must team up to stop a band of bank robbers.      Okay, so there's nothing deep or profound about the movie, but, Latifah and Fallon are talented comedians and together they make for a lot of laughs and a fun ninety minutes.    Enjoy!
B0007N1AI6|4.0|I'm not gonna waste a bunch of space breaking every song down. But I will say that if you ever loved Judas Priest then you still will.  This is everything Priest is known for, screaming HEAVY METAL!  If you want a Priest album that sounds like the Halford solo discs then you're barking up the wrong tree.  That was a different project with different musicians.  I've read review after review of people saying, *adopts whinning tone* \\"but the Halford discs were soooo much better.\\" The Halford discs ARE good but this is Judas Priest....okay?

B0000CFW87|4.0|What a beautiful album!  I can listen to him over and over again.  I am always and will be Josh's fan but recently I accidently discovered \\"Mario Frangoulis\\" the Greek crossover singer (Sometimes I Dream, CD) who I enjoy as much.
B0002KVUKM|2.0|Take every imaginable monster and throw it into the mix ... even this cannot save \\"Van Helsing.\\"  Frankenstein is an absolute joke, Dracula not nearly likeable or detestable enough, Igor and the townspeople's makeup questionable and the special affects a bit cheesy.  Occasionally a redeeming quality, such as the werewolf transformation and the helpful friar, but certainly not enough to sustain a 2 hour movie.  If you want good vampires, go elsewhere.
B00001NFCY|5.0|After hearing the popular \\"Higher\\" and \\"With Arms Wide Open\\" I couldn't help but to find why I was so drawned to Creed.  Human Clay is like mainstream rock's audio book of the Bible.  Scott Stapp, the group leader and vocalist, have a way of writing that spark some revolution within yourself.  Track 11 \\"Inside Us All\\" speaks a gospel being preached on a Sunday morning.  The crisp, clean production from John Kurzweg makes the sound big.  This is classic material and it never gets old no matter how many times you have it on repeat.  \\"What If\\"  everyone had a copy of Human Clay?  This world would be a \\"Beautiful\\" place.  It say's 11 tracks on the sleeve, but there is actually 12 with \\"With Arms Wide Open (Remix)\\".
0345442989|5.0|Preparing myself for Episode III, I decided to start at what I considered the beginning.  This is the prequel to The Phantom Menace which explains a bit about the Trade Federation, Valorum, Palpatine, and the tangled web that makes up the taxation of the trade routes. <br /> <br />And though some of the political motives escaped me sometimes, it was an excellent start to the Star Wars Universe.  The action was quick, and the characters were well done.  The new character Cohl made for exciting reading, as he has a hint of Han Solo to him.  Also Palpatine, Valorum, Qui-Gon Jinn, and surprisingly Tarkin are interesting to watch in these early stages of the fall of the Republic. <br /> <br />The Jedi take a backseat in this political thriller while the Senators, Freedom Fighters (also called terrorists), and the Trade Federation are the focal point of this novel. <br /> <br />Luceno does a good job of keeping the action rolling and the suspense intriguing, even for a book that isn't filled to the brim with space dogfights and flashy jedi.  It is also obvious that Luceno has a love of all things Star Wars and is very knowledgable about some of the smaller details of the universe.
B00003CXIP|2.0|Four 12-year-old boys go searching for a dead body. When they find it, they have to fight off a group of older boys. Not much of a story, though I guess it's not meant to be, but rather a study of the four boys. One is smart, another is a take-charge type, the third is an odd-man out pudgy type, and the fourth is the victim of a psychotic father and not too bright. The problem is that one minute the kids sound like slob-mouthed 12 year olds and the next like adults in an O'Neill drama analyzing their \\"ruined\\" lives. Not very believable--or it tries too hard to be and fails, which is worse.
B0002T7ZKW|5.0|Wow...  I'm seeing some great examples of American Idiots just by reading these reviews!   <br /> <br />It's amazing how closed minded some people are.  <br /> <br />Anyways, great album!  I got to see them live during their first show on this tour - and I was impressed.  You definately get your money's worth.  :)
B00000I8UF|5.0|This is one of Art Blakey's best albums, recorded in 1958. Lee Morgan is on trumpet, Benny Golson on tenor, Bobby Timmons on piano, Jymie Merritt on bass, with Blakey on drums. Benny Golson also contributed some of the tunes: \\"Blues March\\" is a jazz masterpiece and the slow \\"Along Came Betty\\" is almost as good. Everything clicks on this session, and it should be on anyone's list of the top 20 albums of the hard bop era. Highly recommended.
0790744295|4.0|What a great film. Very 80's from the music to the hair, but it's still a lot of fun to watch. \\"BEDELIA - WHERE'S MY CAKE YOU DIRTY BITCH!\\" When he crawls out of the grave...I wish MY voice sounded like THAT! HA HA HA! The fact is Creepshow needs a deluxe edition. Creepshow 2 gets one and this one DOESN'T?!? That's not right. Technical note: The full-frame version adds information to the top and bottom of the letterboxed edition. The widescreen version adds absolutely nothing to the sides. Take your pick.
B00005JMJG|3.0|Writer Kaufman is one of those guys that has great ideas, no doubt about that. \\"Being John Malkavich\\" was a genius idea, very quirky and unusual. Sad thing is, the actual story of the idea turns out to be rather drab and slow. Same with this movie, sorry to say. A brilliant IDEA ruined by bad writing - slow and tedious pace equals droopy eyes and eventually boredom. But I can't say the movie is a total loss. What keeps the interest here isn't the story, but the atmosphere. The director has done a good job keeping a disjointed feel to what you're seeing on the screen. Nothing is very steady, nothing looks pre-cooked or pre-planned. Almost a documentary style, as if they're capturing what's really going on rather than filming take after take like they do in many movies. Even if they DO a billion takes, it sure feels fresh. Another thing that saves this movie is the music, all of which moves along the flow of the story easier to swallow. Hollywood should hire Kaufman for his ideas, but then hire a decent screenwriter to adapt that idea.
B000002H6C|4.0|You know what I've noticed about Metallica? Up until The Self Titled Album (The Black One) All of their Music Defined what the Album was about, Kill 'em All was fun...it was fast, and that's what they were singing about. Ride the Lightning is tragic, it's slower paced, and angry, and that's what they were singing about. Master of Puppets is brutal, it's fast, its destructive, and once again, that's what they were singing about. ...And Justice for All is a machine, it's a wall of never ending sound, that never relents, never slows down, and never stops pounding you into a pulp...And that's what they were singing about. <br /> <br />I'd recomend their first three albums before this one...but I'd recomend this before all of their other junk.
0553565915|1.0|I have read book after book on life after death, reincarnation, visions, various religions,EVP, spirituality, etc.  This book is the ONLY book I felt was an insult to my intelligence!  I felt so strongly about how insulting this book was that I would have fined the author for expecting ANYONE to be stupid enough to believe her bizarre story!  I have never felt so strongly about a book in my life!  Not only did I want a refund of my money, I wanted a refund of the time I wasted on it!  This book definitely belongs in the FICTION section.
B00070DK5K|5.0|The short review for those already familiar with either the original vinyl or the Ryko CD re-issue:  Is this version worth buying?  Yes.<br /><br />Having the full concert, restored to its original running order makes a great difference; the weaker songs (like \\"Here Today, Gone Tomorrow\\") work much better in their original concert context.  This version of \\"Space Oddity\\" (not available on any previous versions) is surprisingly mature and sophisticated, well worth a few listens.  And the new mix breaths fresh vitality into the performance (there are, in fact, a few subtle \\"production\\" changes in this mix that make me wonder if this version is truer to the concert, or the result of reducing the surround sound mix to stereo for the CD - the most obvious incident being the change in the way Bowie's voice echoes away in \\"Moonage Daydream\\").<br /><br />For those not familiar with this album, and perhaps not as familiar with Bowie's live performances, Bowie takes the opportunity in concert to re-interpret his works, often using radically new arrangements that show off a different facet of the song than the studio version.  So David Live is no \\"greatest hits live\\" marketing ploy.<br /><br />The band, built around Mike Garson's awesome keyboard work and three saxophones, create a unique rock sound heard only on this CD.  Earl Slick had to claw his way through this rich, sophisticated mix to have the guitar solos stand out.<br /><br />With the exception of \\"Sweet Thing\\" and \\"Rebel Rebel\\" all of the Diamond Dogs material on this CD is superior to the studio versions.  \\"Rock & Roll With Me\\" has a warmth lacking in the studio version.  And though the studio version of \\"Sweet Thing\\" is hard to top, this version stands as an equal re-working of the piece.  (Reviewers at the time this was first released often suggested skipping Diamond Dogs altogether, and opting for these versions of the songs.)<br /><br />Likewise, many of the Aladdin Sane tracks greatly benefit from these live re-workings.  \\"Cracked Actor\\" is much more accessible than the studio version.  Though Garson's piano solo was superior on the studio version, Bowie's vocal and the live arrangement of \\"Aladdin Sane\\" make for a warmer more passionate version of the song.<br /><br />This album was initially haled as a live masterpiece, then vilified as rock excess during the new wave backlash, and largely forgotten until the 90's re-issue.  Now, more than 30 years after the tour, it stands as a unique and fascinating re-invention of Bowie's early 70s work.these live re-workings.  \\"Cracked Actor\\" is much more accessible than the studio version.

B00004YA66|3.0|Frequency is not for family viewing because there is some graphic violent content, but overall it leans very much is the direction of the `general' audience of all ages except for young kids, who maybe would have enjoyed this one better than adults if it toned down the violence (something us adults rarely ask for these days), instead the upped violent content doesn't work that well, nesting in what is at heart Spielberg/Zemeckis family drama come quasi science-fiction twilight zone episode, it is hard to buy it, but it is still equally hard to say that we should not see it, may help you to quit smoking nicotine, given that you see some age sequencing, the make up effects between timelines is quite well done, except in the reverse with Quaid looking a little older than his younger aging makeup suggests (we are getting old now too dude!) Caviezel does the Brooklyn cop-thing as per the book never really that engaging, but then again prefers the human story as opposed to the two part, let's dig up a generational ham radio kit + northern lights outside in the sky = breaks the space time barrier that allows a father fire-fighter to make contact with his cop son in the future as they hope to change a few things like the father's death by fire, a scene which plays out on a helter-skelter for an overdrawn orchestral score, pulling the valves out of your heart, misdirection is met not by the fact that this is exactly the kind of brainy sci-fi we like to see, but the execution was only so-so, the action not bad but the `kid friendly' suspense drawn out at times and not matching because of confusion that the director does not explain and when something we understand does not need explaining, the director gives us a tutorial there instead. There is even a feeling that some parts are a little far-fetched when the film need not be, means blowing up various scenes lessens the impact in the long run, we all like the idea, and maybe if your 11-year-old son was going to steal an adult thriller when you where not looking, Frequency is the kind you would hope he ends up with and not \\"Rambo III\\", this is solid three star entertainment that I would easily watch instead of \\"Alien Vs Predator\\" or \\"Riddick\\"(Pitch Black is great). I know this movie has a fan-base and I can see why. My problem is that I have seen movies like \\"The Dead Zone\\" from David Cronenberg, certainly more adult, but the idea of a psychic instead of a ham radio being the sci-fi part just works out a whole lot better in that 1983 offering. I would recommend Frequency, yeah silly at times by watch it anyway because the feel is there, maybe not the all the brains, watch it with reserves is all I can say, and would certainly tell you to catch \\"The Dead Zone\\" also, because I feel it is somewhat similar, much older, but a lot better.thriller when you where not looking, Frequency is the kind you would hope he ends up with and not \\"Rambo III\\", this is solid three star entertainment that I would easily watch instead of \\"Alien Vs Predator\\" or \\"Riddick\\"(Pitch Black is great).

B0000048CX|2.0|This doesn't sound like YLT at all. If you like a bunch of slow, acoustic, sad songs this is an album for you.  <br />Maybe it's the fact that this record is a good attempt to pay tribute to some unknown bands that it gets a couple of stars...I honestly, don't get it. <br />
B0007OCG4W|1.0|This was probably the greatest disappointment of the year.  Four very talented actors came together and there was nothing oustanding about the movie.  The acting was stilted, the plot a bit forced, and no character development.  I could not connect with any of these characters and just wanted my money back.
B0002OERI0|4.0|This is a great CD by Green Day, even though it is a little explicit.  It has two popular songs played on the radio, both American Idiot and Boulevarde of Broken Dreams.  The rest of their songs are good as well.  I would recommend this CD for those of you who like punk and rock.
B0007P3582|1.0|Aiyo, why do people say that he's a snitch? No, for real, I'm just wondering what the story is. Did he rat out his homeboy or what? <br />   Anyway, this crap sells because of Fifty's marketing genius. The beats are hot, so if you're a braindead kid who thinks rap consits only of G-unit and Eminem than go get this. Lyrically, there are only 3-4 songs worth listening to (\\"Baltimore Love thing\\", \\"when the Guns Come out\\", \\"Toy Soldiers\\"...). Bu even there his rhymes are awful at places. For example on \\"Baltimore Love thing\\"  on one bar he rhymes only 2 words - \\"you\\" and \\"too\\". Wow, unbelievable lyrical skills, ain't it? <br />Stick with \\"Get Ritch...\\", it was pretty good. <br />Hit me back on the snitch question.

B0000BYM3K|2.0|Amongst all the reviews and opinions, one thing must be saida: the only trouble holding Maiden back in the compositional skills has a name: Janick Gers, a mediocre, talentless guitarist that, unfortunately, seems to have infected both Murray and Smith. <br /> <br />
B0006GAOBI|2.0|Had I have read a RECENT review about how horribly Richard Kelly butchered his beautiful theatrical version on this RECENT Director's Cut release, I would NOT have bought THIS DVD. <br /> <br />IT DOESN'T EVEN START THE SAME!!!  Instead of Echo and the Bunnymen, it's INXS (INXS was a great band, but \\"Killing Moon\\" set the pace in the original) The added scenes tried way too hard to explain the events, making the Director's Cut more frustrating to enjoy. <br /> <br />Donnie Darko is a SPECTACULAR movie! Get the THEATRICAL version!
B00005JKES|1.0|For everybody out there who is ticked off at the missing pilot from season 1 of twin peaks and has considered paying $100 or more for it don't! You can buy a multi-region dvdplayer for as low as $30-40 and then go to amazon.co.uk and buy Twin Peaks season 1 WITH the pilot! It's about $30 dollars (this is all in american currency by the way) and you get the entire first season and the long lost pilot that is so coveted among peaks freaks. Don't waste your money on this edition like i did, only to end up dissappointed, get the right edition the first time. (you may not have to buy a multi-region dvdplayer if you have a really really cheap dvd player, but i would test this theory before you buy twin peaks)
B0002OERI0|3.0|I liked this album a lot more before they started playing the same 3 songs on the radio every 5 minutes. Now just because im sick of hearing it on the radio constantly doesn't mean i based my rating entirely on that and i didn't change that rating because of it. I think the album is just Ok. I respect the fact that they wanted to go in a different direction but it doesn't work for them. If i wanted to hear long drawn out songs i would listen to metallica, but metallica's songs are made to be that way and are entertaining the whole way through. Greenday was punk, most songs being fast paced and short to the point. That worked well for them because they were concise and delivered fun lyrics and guitar riffs. Now that they have to have a \\"message\\" it took longer for them to convey it thus drawing out the songs and making them boring. It's too bad when bands who have a reputation for a certain type of music screw it up by making a style that isnt them (sum41's chuck comes to mind as well). It annoys me when my little brother goes to launch and \\"boulevard of broken dreams\\" comes on and he thinks its the greatest thing ever. The kid is 13, what he hell does he have to be depressed about? I'm going to try to be a Jahova's witness and try to convert him to old Greenday. I just have to hope that the damage isn't already done.
6304698690|5.0|I had never seen any versions of 'The Secret Garden,' nor had I read the original book by Frances H. Burnett, but it did appeal to me, that's why when I ran into it at my local video store, I couldn't help myself from buying it, I payed $4.99 for it and I quickly realized what a bargain that was.  This movie was worth every penny, absolutely gorgeous. <br /> <br />This is one of those films, aimed mainly at children, that the whole family can enjoy, both the young and old.  The story centers around Mary Lennox, recently orphaned, sent to live with her uncle at an old manor, surrounded by a gloomy and foggy moor.  At first, Mary doesn't seem to enjoy it, not because she misses her neglective parents, but because she is lonely and longs for someone to play with.  At the manor, she must live with the mean Mrs. Medlock, whom she dislikes, however, Mary soon makes friends with Martha, her younger brother Dickon and a young ill boy named Colin, who is Mary's cousin. <br />Mary discovers many secrets, as why Colin is always kept in a lonely bed and why her uncle is so down and depressed, but the biggest secret she finds is the entrance to an old garden, which she and her new friend Dickon help bring to life. <br /> <br />This movie, as I have already stated, is beautifully filmed, with lots of beautiful landscapes and settings and the most breathtaking melodies ever, many following the tone of the closing song \\"Winter Light.\\"  The actors portray their characters wonderfully.  The film doesn't particularly have much humor, most of the comic relief here is given by Martha, in a way she is a funny character, this is a good thing for the film not to have much humor, it adds to it's 'gloomy' beauty. <br /> <br />This movie inspired me to read the book, at first I had a bit of trouble understanding what was going on, both in the book and in the film, I especially had a bit of trouble understanding the Yorkshire accents of some of the characters, but after repeated viewings, I began to understand better.  I would recommend this film to anyone, if you get a chance, get the soundtrack as well, as the music is one of the stronger points of the film.

B000035Z3K|5.0|Over the past 20 years or so the 1931 version of Dracula has come under great scrutiny.  Long regarded as one of the true classics of horror, modern critics have taken a more critical eye to the film and as such, many have brought it down from classic status to almost a mere curiosity piece.  They do this, no doubt, as a way to make themselves appear to be so much smarter than the critics who came before them.  Because of modern critics rather abnormal love affair with Frankenstein director James Whale, his films have become regarded not only as horror classics, but classics of early American cinema in generally.  Meanwhile poor Tod Browning is remembered more for \\"Freaks\\" than for Dracula.<br /><br />Another reason for their seeming disdain of Dracula is the performance of Lugosi.  Yet these modern critic's opinions are shaped not by Lugosi's performance in Dracula, but by his later performances where he was relegated to Monogram \\"B\\" movies in order to make a buck or two...and that's about all he did make off those films.  And yet again, Karloff gets off scott-free when it comes to his \\"B\\" movie performances...especially those abysmal Mexican made films at the end of his career.<br /><br />It is argued that the pacing in Dracula is slow and that the film suffers due to its staginess.  Well of course it feels staged in as much as it was adapted from the Stage version which Lugosi had played for years.  Slow pacing?  Perhaps a bit.  This is no doubt due to the lack of background music since this was a very early talkie. The DVD version fixes that with a new musical score.<br /><br />There's something to be said for atmosphere and none of the classic early horrors had the atmosphere of Dracula's opening scene with Lugosi and his brides rising from their coffins deep below Castle Dracula.  The scene of the three brides gliding forth through the misty crypt with that blank, yet hungry look in their eyes, still gives me the shivers and was equalled by nothing in its day.  Great credit for the atmosphere and gothic look must be given to cinematographer Karl Freund, whom modern critics have conjectured was the true director of the film as Browning had had his problems with the bottle.  Frankly I don't buy it.  Having seen Some of Browning's silent films like \\"The Unholy Three\\", \\"The Unknown\\", as well as his \\"Mark of the Vampire\\", I have no doubt that Browning was the director of the film in action as well as in the title.<br /><br />As far as Lugosi goes, one cannot discount the incredible achievement he made in this role.  He was not the first choice of Universal depsite his experience on the stage.  Lon Chaney Sr. was the first choice before his untimely death in 1930.  Lugosi was not even one of the top candidates but won the role eventually.  Writing off his performance as wooden shows a lack of understanding of the pure presence he brought to the role.  Were his gestures and flourishes a bit overly dramatic?  Maybe...but that's part of the charm of the role if you ask me.  Lugosi still brought pure evil to the role and his seduction of Mina (Helen Chandler) remains chilling to this day.<br /><br />You can't talk about this film without mentioning Dwight Frye playing the insane, bug-eating Renfield.  Few men have ever done \\"crazy\\" better than the late Frye.  Edward Van Sloan as Van Helsing always brought a strong, smart, and calming influence to his many roles in Universal Horror films and would reprise his role as Van Helsing five years later in the sequel \\"Dracula's Daughter\\".<br /><br />No...don't listen to the modern critics.

044024157X|4.0|John Grisham's new novel, The Last Juror, commits one crime: that of misleading the reader with its title and ominous cover shot.  From the first paragraph, however, the reader will discern that this is no ordinary Grisham thriller, but a yarn high on atmosphere and character.    This reader has undertaken every one of Grisham's thrillers with mixed results, but has not read the recent Bleachers and A Painted House (after learning they were not thrillers per se but, well, more like The Last Juror).  That mistake will have to be corrected.  Grisham has matured as a writer.  In The Last Juror, Grisham's storytelling is effortless.  He barely breaks a sweat, even as the book weaves between the main story line (if it can be called that), involving the trial and consequences of an alleged murderer, and the protagonist's observations of, befriending of, and, ultimately, integration into the local culture.    The book cannot really be categorized as a \\"suspense thriller\\".  However, while the supsenseful overtones the book does have are rarely of an edge-of-your-seat quality, The Last Juror represents a refreshing change from the thousands of cat-and-mouse thrillers out there.  Highly recommended.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Passion Re-Cut<br /><br />This is a review of the Recut edition of \\"The Passion.\\"  The film flows easily and the six missing minutes were not needed.  Gibson should have left the film unrated, and left out these offensive six minutes in the first place.  Notwithstanding this, I was quite impressed with Gibson's directorial abilities. He is quite a talent, akin to Nemoy or even Welles. I hope he nurtures this gift.<br /><br />As to the content, there is nothing new in this movie. The bare facts of the Christ's Atonement have been film and refilmed man times with many different actors.  The only new things deal with cinematography, and then the presentation of the side characters.  And the intensity of the violence.  Of course the Romans were not wimps, and scourging and crucifixion were excruciating.  Gibson saw as his goal the most accurate representation of this scourging. IMHO, we get the idea, and to emphasize the gore is emphasizing just one aspect of the Atonement, and it can distract from the ultimate victory.<br /><br />I found the subtitles helpful. You get the idea, but the film is infinitely better when we see Christ's almost nonchalant approach to his death.  He takes time to mister words to his mother (only a Catholic would pick up on this), keeps his peace with Herod, debates philosophy with Pilate (in Latin), and is absolutely above it all.  He must be a lunatic, or . . .<br /><br />In addition to the subtitles, the subtleties were also helpful.  You see Pilate caught between his wife's dream, his sense of honor, and the pragmatic desire to keep peace and keep his political position.  The encounter with Claudia and the Marys (something only a Catholic would see) is priceless.<br /><br />As to the alleged anti-Semitism, I just remind people about Seinfeld's Uncle Leo.  The reason why Seinfeld created Uncle Leo is that many people make anti-Semitic accusations at the drop of the hat, or as they are passing the hat.  This is just a way to avoid dealing with Gibson's message and passion.<br /><br />SPOILER WARNING:<br /><br />I am a bit critical of the special effects, specifically the snake-up-the-nose, and the growling troll under the bridge.  I understand that the Gollum-Baby was an attempt to mock the true Madonna.  However, these scenes gave the film a \\"Lord of the Rings\\" feel. It may be asserted that this is the TRUE Lord of the Rings, but to give the Atonement a surrealistic feel could leave some people with the idea that the Atonement is surreal.  Then God is surreal, and ultimately we are surreal-like the Matrix.<br /><br />I understand that devils are real, but they were depicted as run-of-the-mill \\"Scary Teen Movie\\" type bogeymen.  Frankly, some people cannot make the distinction.  This film was not allegory, as Narnia or Middle-Earth, but a historical film.  Keep the two separate.<br /><br />END OF SPOILER<br /><br />Gibson, in addition to being a devout Catholic, is a good Kierkegaardian.

B000002572|5.0|If aliens landed on earth tomorrow and asked me what rock & roll was, I would play them the Boston album.  <br /> <br />WOW...I just heard the entire CD for the first time a few days ago and I almost fell over...literally. (and I'm a musician of 15 years) What a stunning production.  <br /> <br />For years I put off Boston as cheesy, corporate arena rock, but this music is actually really solid and catchy- I was just listening to the snobby critics and not the actual music. Tom Scholz is a great musician, and what a producer! ...If I didn't know any better, I would have guessed this was made in the mid 80's. I can see how it initially blew everyone away back in '76. <br /> <br />This album exhumes everything a classic rock album should- HIGH ENERGY: Catchy guitar riffs and soaring solos, strong vocals and a tight rhythm section, and TALENT. And it has some great song themes: \\"Hitch a Ride\\" (an upbeat song about suicide), and  \\"Smokin'\\" (Obviously about marijuana...music's best companion)  <br /> <br />Anyone who loves classic rock should have this album...it's a rock & roll staple. And if you don't like it, you're a snob. <br /> <br />
B00007G1ZM|5.0|Since everyone and their brother has reviewed the film, which is possibly the GREATEST example of film noir ever captured, I'll review the Joan special on the flip-side fo the disc.<br /><br />The special, narrated by the uberfab Anjelica Huston, is a great way to get to know our beloved Joan. Including rare clips from early films and radio spots, we are taken on a ride of what it was like being Crawford from the early 30s to her death in 1977.<br /><br />Highlights include a clip of her appearance on The Man From U.N.C.L.E., a reading of Ibsen's A Doll's House, a reel of face slappin' hijinks, and commentary by Mrs. Voorhees herself, Betsy Palmer!<br /><br />My favorite part has to be director Vincent Sherman recalling Crawford the mother. She was balling out Christopher in front of him and he said, \\"Joan, please don't humiliate the boy in front of people.\\" She frankly responded with, \\"I told you never to interfere with me and my children and you can just get out.\\" And as he walked towards the door, she stuck her foot out and tripped him! He was able to catch himself on the door and turned around and slapped her so hard across the face she went flying to the floor!<br /><br />That's our Joanie!
6305252521|4.0|I saw this movie shortly after it came out in video form.  I thought it was an interesting idea.  I had a chance to see it last night with my 12 year old son and I enjoyed it again.  It has the rare quality of being a movie that can be enjoyed by people of different generations.  If you don't know the story, that's all the better.  The movie does an excellent job of filling us in on what's what.  We get a lot of the basics during the opening credits, see some of the \\"show\\" and get more helpful information as we go along.  The many role players that we see on the screen reinforce the idea that we, too, are now watching the same Truman Show that they are seeing.  We come on board at the time that Truman finally starts to figure out that things aren't what they seem to be. <br /> <br />The way the movie lets us see the \\"acting\\" in the actors, the coordination of the technical staff, the quick reactions to unforseen changes in Truman's behavior all help to make the movie that much more enjoyable.  It also gives us a sense of the shallowness of the program itself.  That point was amplified when we get to meet The Truman Show's creator played by Ed Harris.  Certainly a large element of this movie is a poke at the nature of television; what we like to watch and why.  By corrupting the old adage \\"truth is stranger than fiction\\" we are led to understand that the human interest shows on TV merely take time away from living our own lives.  What is really strange is how television on so many channels these days seems to sense that \\"The Truman Show\\" was a harbinger rather than a satire.  We now find out way more that we should need to know about people who voluntarily place themselves in positions that require that them to bare their humanness.   <br /> <br />I thought about rating this movie a \\"5\\" based on its' originality.  However, I stopped short of that because I thought it ended before it had the chance to explore other possibilities.  Yes, there is only so much time in amovie to say so many things that simplicity is a virtue.  Nonetheless, I felt that the movie failed to fully challenge the potential of its' unique concept.  What it did give us was certainly worth watching.       <br /> <br />
B000001GPX|5.0|This is the finest interpretation of Beethoven's 5th and 7th Symphonies that I have ever heard.  Kleiber's versions of Beethoven's 5 and 7 are head and shoulders above the Karajan recordings.  The outer movements in each work are exceptionally played with an intensity that is unparalleled in symphonic recordings.  The inner movements, especially in the Allegretto of the seventh, the music is loaded with passion and incredible phrasing and sensitivity.  This recording should serve as a model for Beethovenian interpretation and should be an essential part of one's symphonic collection.

0671027344|5.0|In a confusing world it's comforting to know that others have crazy thoughts running through their heads just the same as you. In The Perks of Being a Wallflower there is a web of images and depictions that evoke strong emotions within any reader that it traps. This book contains no solution to everyday problems. It has no guidelines to happy living. Instead, it portrays the fact that there is no one answer, no cure all in the end for a life that lacks perfection. I've never related to a character in my life better than Charlie, and it's a fair assumption that most kids who read this book will see some similarities of their own. This is the novel of a depressed generation, one filled with people lost in their clocks. If anything this book serves to remind them that they're not the only ones looking for a way out.

B0007GAEW6|5.0|To be honest after listening to the album for the first time I had no idea what I thought. Now all I remember from it was feeling very vulnerable. After the second time and even more so after the 3rd spin I realized this was the greatest album I've personally ever experienced. The amount of feelings that this album has evoked in me says a lot. How often do you actually get to listen to music takes you on a ride with your emotions. The Mars Volta succeded at making an album that connects the listener to the musical current where we forget all the crap that life flings our way. My standards for other music has become much more stick now. Most music leaves me unsatisfied and wanting more.  <br />If you want an album that takes you places and fills you up and tastes good in your ears this album is a have to have.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|Yet another movie about confused city folk who criss-cross each other in precarious relationships and botch them with a selfish pursuit of gratification, guilt, envy.<br /><br />I suppose this could have been an interesting take on craven Modern Relationships had it not been done a hundred times before, with more polish. \\"Sex and the City\\" or \\"Sidewalks of New York\\" had the good sense to play out such emotional faux-pas with a streak of humor. \\"In The Company of Men\\" showed characters with cruelty but reflected the brutal nature of the corporate world they inhabited. \\"We Dont Live Here Anymore\\" laid out marital quandaries in painstaking detail.<br /><br />Closer simply lacks such a trope. Its characters resemble stray leaves caught in the windstorm of an urban existence. We never see them happy, we seldom see them being genuinely romantic (beyond first overtures, where most of the film's endurability is located), or even in a state of peaceful equilibrium. When their libido ruins bonds we find it tough to root for them, all we see is dysfunction.<br /><br />It's the acting that rises over the rubble of a poor script and makes this film watchable. Jude Law's character is slime personified, and he does well to embody it. Natalie Portman plays a stripper (who mysteriously has her tops on even in a stripping sequence) and for a 24-year old she packs in a lot of punch. Julia Roberts is somewhat bland in portraying a character whose motivations rarely make any sense.<br /><br />But the real winner is Clive Owen, who finally shows some of the potential I've been suspecting for a while, especially after his imposing cameo in King Arthur. He plays the rough, voyeuristic doctor, the only person in the film capable of cutting to the heart of the blather around him. Grungy, no B.S. Easily his best work to date.<br /><br />Recommended rental for sure, but such a star-studded lineup should really have amounted to a more compelling film.
0060930187|5.0|Despite my penchant for both women's literature and modern American literature, and despite the fact that I even majored in American Literature in college, I never got around to reading this book.  I so loved Plath's poetry, particularly in college, that I think I was secretly frightened to read her autobiography because it would force me to think carefully about her tragic end.  Now that I've finally finished it, I can count it among my favorite novels.  Its colloquial and simple language makes it an easy read.  Esther's deep struggles with the opportunities both open and closed to women are as accurate and pertinent today as they were 30 or 40 years ago, and Plath's riveting and terrifying description of a young girl's plunge into mental illness is crafted with such ease that the reader begins to question her own sanity.  The real tragedy of the novel is knowing the true end of Plath, and thinking how much more wonderful prose and poetry she could have contributed.
0783225725|3.0|Maybe when it was first released, back when I was in college, I would have been more impressed with the creepy aspects of the film.  It is a fun movie, tho.  When the Stranger comes into town and asks for a shave and a bath, the shaking of the barber's hand holding the straight razor was hysterical.  Then the Stranger rapes a obnoxious horny woman whose makeup was right out of the 1970s. It was obvious the man had been in the desert, alone, for a long time.  The dream sequences were confusing, was the Stranger a reincarnated ghost type guy who had come back for revenge because of what had happened to him?  Or was it his brother that had been whipped to death?  Who knows?  Who cares?  We laughed and then lost interest.  Of course, it's Clint Eastwood and that makes anything worth watching.  We kept comparing his performance as the Stranger to his performance in Paint Your Wagon where he sings.
B0006399FS|4.0|\\"How to Dismantle the Atomic Bomb\\" is a good effort by U2.  The single \\"Vertigo\\" is an enjoyable guitar blast.  Bono's vocals on \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" have such a worn aching quality that it does make this track affecting.  \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" is intriguing with a good build & its haunting guitar attack, \\"A city lit by fireflies, they're advertising in the skies for people like us.\\"  \\"A Man & A Woman\\" has a Brazilian flavor and boasts one of the band's most engaging melodies and an excellent lyric, \\"I could never take a chance of losing love to find romance in the mysterious distance between a man & a woman.\\"  \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" has some excellent moments and is a decent effort by the veteran Irish band.  While it may not be U2's crowning achievement, it is a strong effort.  Enjoy!
0385512058|5.0|He's on my board of directors. And as it turns out, Keith walks the walk -- I know a LOT of other people who also know Keith. Reading the book will give you a pretty fair idea why. He's an outrageous character, and he's also outrageously good. Some people are turned off by an explicit focus on maximizing and leveraging personal connections. Some people who see the point might not do it quite Keith's way. But VERY few people fail to grasp the power of these ideas, once they are exposed to this pattern of thinking about relationships and personal generosity. And Keith has presented the ideas in a very compelling fashion - get the book and see for yourself. I tried just one idea of his -- introducing two powerful, interesting people to each other that I had only just met that day myself, but who I realized would probably be delighted to meet each other because they shared a very strong common interest. They sparked, both were grateful and delighted that I'd taken the initiative, and now I'm getting to know both of them better myself. Believe me, there's much more. Get the book.

0380778556|5.0|My love for the classics intersects with my mother's love for murder mysteries . . . My mother had been telling me forever to read this book.  I would get through a few chapters and grow tired of the incredibly long descriptive passages.  On a recent trip to London, though, I steeled myself for the first couple of slow chapters (which my mother kept telling me were \\"worth it\\" to get through) and fell in love with this novel.  It is fascinating, mysterious, romantic, and terrifying all at once.  I simply could not put it down.  It will remain a favorite of mine for life.
B000001IPL|5.0|The above quote serves as the theme with which Dexter Holland and company tie together their definitive '90s punk album. Setting a new standard in terms of sales for indie records, The Offspring exploded onto the map with the rare alternative CD that anyone could appreciate. <br /> <br />As previously mentioned, Smash is primarily an album of individuality. The titular track states, \\"I'm not a trendy [expletive which I know will get censored]... I do what I want, I do what I feel like... and I don't give a [expletive which I know will get censored] if it's good enough for you.\\" There are occasional humorous asides, such as in \\"Bad Habit\\", a satirical view on road rage in which the singer vents, \\"they say the road's a dangerous place; if you flip me off, I'm the danger you'll face.\\" But in general, the band is concerned with impressing upon you the importance of thinking for yourself in a world filled with conformity and blind faith; \\"just give me something to believe in,\\" Holland cries out, a demand echoed by his generation and mine. <br /> <br />(The Amazon reviewer is correct - while I can appreciate all of this band's work, their early recordings are primitive, whereas their later stuff borders on the line of mindless fluff; Smash was their golden age and will likely be what The Offspring are remembered for.)

B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Not being an expert critique of this producers works like so many others, I originally purchased the VHS copy of this movie (\\"Warriors Of The Wind\\") for my son when he was small and we watched it many times together and enjoyed it.  A short time ago I introduced this same video tape to his son, my grandson and was able to also enjoy it again thru his eyes.  I was unaware that it was being re-released on DVD under the name \\"Nausicaa Of The Vally Of The Wind\\" until I saw it for sale and then I was confused as to whether or not it was the original we had loved or a sequel to that story due to the re-naming.  For those apparent few, like ourselves, whom knew no better and still loved the story in it's original release form; this remake will be a miracle and a minefield.  It is extremely well done and I definitely recommend it's purchase - but the dialogue is drastically different from the original.  Not bad, definitely not worse; but VERY different from what we veterans of only the VHS release expect based on that original release.  The hardest thing for my grandson to accept is that it is the same film, and yet so very many things are now called something different and (especially) that the name of the princess/heroine is different - he is not happy with my explanations that Princess Zandra is now Princess Nausicaa.  In looking over the existing reviews for this release, I don't see that this small fact has been mentioned before.  So for anybody else out there that is wondering like I did; the video and audio are done extremely well - but the movie will be jarringly different simply because of all the additional video \\"bits & pieces\\" that have been restored and because the dialogue is so completely re-written.  You will love it - but it will take a bit of getting used to if you, like us, are expecting what you watched before to be unchanged.
B00001OH7O|5.0|1971's \\"Hunky Dory\\" is typically considered the first 'essential' David Bowie album. It's his most overt pop album, with catchy hooks and bouncy, upbeat melodies on most of the songs.  <br /> <br />Most of the songs feature strings, and superb piano work from Rick Wakeman (of Yes fame); thus, giving it a somewhat symphonic/jazzy pop feel. \\"Changes\\" fits this description perfectly, and is a classic pop song to this day. <br /> <br />\\"Oh! You Pretty Things\\" builds up slowly to a killer hook; \\"Life on Mars\\" has an even bigger build up to its sweeping orchestral chorus. It's spine tingling. <br /> <br />The bouncy piano work on songs like \\"Kooks\\" and \\"Fill Your Heart\\" give them a showtune like feel. \\"Baby Bitch\\" is really the only guitar driven rocker on here, and seems like a precursor to his glam-rock material. <br /> <br />Other highlights include the cascading \\"Quicksand\\", the labrynthine, trippy \\"Andy Warhol\\", and the subdued, mysterious closer, \\"The Belway Brothers\\".  <br /> <br />The first of many essential Bowie albums. Don't pass this gem up.
0684800713|5.0|Ernest Hemingway's first novel deals with the character Jake and his love for Brett. Brett also loves Jake, but Jake cannot physically love Brett, due to an injury in the war causing his impotence.  <br /> <br />The characterizations are completely believalbe, with the jaded \\"lost generation\\" of artists and writers in Paris. The prose is famous, and deservingly so, with its clear and filling simplicity. Hemingway's lean prose influenced American prose style more than other writer. All American writers should be indebted to him. <br /> <br />Eventually, the main characters leave Paris, and begin a trip to Pampolona, Spain. The imagery described in Spain has never been clearer.  <br /> <br />Due to their jadedness and depression over the war, the characters drink and get drunk constantly throughout the novel. Brett falls in love with different characters, even though Jake is the only one right for her.  <br /> <br />She wants to love him and cannot. The war has seperated the two lovers forever. This is why the novel is so heartbreaking and sad. Jake and Brett can see each other, but they can't make love and live have a normal love-life. <br /> <br />Overall I found the book very beautiful and satisfying.
B00005JMUA|5.0|If you're like me, before you buy or rent a film you might check the customer reviews on amazon.com to see what other people thought.  The problem is, everyone has different tastes and different opinions on what is good and what is bad.  If you're a Tarantino fan then you probably have seen this film twenty times and don't need to be sold on it's greatness.  But for those of you out there who haven't studied every scene and memorized every line Mr. Pink ever said in Reservoirs Dogs...here's an honst review on the KING GEEK'S latest masterpeice.  Kill Bill Vol. 1 was amazing but seemed a little more exploitive than anything 'ol Quentin had ever done.  The film was just violent and had little plot...it was a straight forward revenge flick that pretty much never trailed from it's inspirations.  I myself am a massive revenge film fan, (check out Rolling Thunder, Man on Fire, Mad Max and King of the Ants) and I have to say that the Bride fighting the Crazy 88 in Vol. 1 was one of the most awesome American produced martial arts action scenes ever captured on film.  Saying that, the film lacked something that Tarantino really unleashed in Vol. 2...power.  Kill Bill Vol. 2 shows us that Quentin has grown up and isn't all about excess and exploitation.  He's not all about violence.  At times in Vol. 2 it felt like it wasn't a Tarantino film because of the emotions that take place in the film.  This film is a lot more dramatic, a lot more epic, and a lot more story and character driven.  SOme of the scenes are so original and so smart and so well directed and acted that it's a wonder why the Academy Awards totally ignored the film at this years Oscars.  Vol. 2 may lack the blood but it's the real guts of what Kill Bill really is.  It's also a homage to Leone's spagetti westerns...half the soundtrack is old Morricone scores from Italian films.  Michael Madsen's character is straight out of an old western.  And then you have the Shaw Brothers tribute with the whole Pei Mei training of The Bride.  This film effected me much more than Vol. 1 did.  Both films are wonderful but Vol. 2 is the one that proves to the world that Tarantino is much more than fancy dialogue and  unforgiving violence.  Look for Quentin's newest project, he directed a scene in the upcoming SIN CITY adaptation in which Benecio Del Toro haunts Clive Owen's Dwight.

B0002OERI0|4.0|I am a self proclaimed punk-elitist, but I try my best to recognize these tendencies and correct them.  Green Day's AMERICAN IDIOT is the best mainstream punk album of the last 12 months, and I disagree that they've become \\"less punk.\\"  For starters, who defines what punk is?  Is punk an unoriginal imitation of the Sex Pistols (which by the way was an amalgamation of no-talent hoodlums assembled together by a record producer who wanted to duplicate in the UK the same scene that the New York Dolls had created in the US).  There is no rubric to really define punk, other than three-chord progression and marked mischieviousness--nor should there be a rubric.  Second, it is blatantly elitism to begin disliking something because it becomes popular and gets radio play.  I don't think that the quantity in which other people are noticing a song affects the original value of that song from the time it was released.  This does not make the song \\"less good.\\" it does not retroactively make the band less talented, make the song less polished, the lyrics less original, the chords less powerful.  This is what they call in economics \\"Diminishing Marginal Utility,\\" which means when you have more access to something you appreciate it less.  And its completely bullsh+t.  All it is is a paranoia that you're not as nonconformist and original as you thought.  People who react this way to good music, just because it gets \\"popular\\" believe that they are really underground and avant garde, and when people that they view as less discerning as them (which is everyone else) start to like something they like, they quickly reject it, in order to keep that self-image of \\"I'm so NOT mainstream.\\"  In fact, it is the very opposite of the punk attitude.  Punk is not about elitism.  Punk has ALWAYS been about inclusion--since the days of Iggy and the Stooges, MC5 and up through Bad Religion and now AMERICAN IDIOT.  Disliking something MERELY because it gets radioplay is actually ANTI-PUNK, since punk is always a rail against the establishment and elitism.   <br />Please pay no attention to people burning their copies of American Idiot (that they rushed out and bought at midnight the day the album came out) just because 'Bulevard of Broken Dreams' is on the top 40 countdown.  These right here are obviously the real american idiots.  The album is doing just what it was meant to do, which is initiate dialogue and questioning things in suburbia and middle America.  Why is it such a bad thing that an Album that is a scorching disapproval of apathy in middle class america is being listened to by those very same people?  I say its a GOOD thing that American Idiot gets all the play that it can.  Perhaps the ignorance it is trying to rebuke will actually start to subside? <br />Most of all, the album is a story.  The narrative has a begining middle and end.  You can't get the whole idea of the album from one song.  In fact, the narrative really doesn't begin until the track AFTER American Idiot.  American Idiot is more just an anthem and a thesis for the rest of the album.  The story begins on track 2, Jesus of Suburbia.  The album deals with disallusionment, independence and comming into your own, so ultimately, you must listen to the album yourself and come to your own conclusions on it, and not let my, nor anyone else's review tell you what to think about what's going on here.  Don't be a part of the Red Neck Agenda, like these silly elitists.  Think for yourself.  That's what the album is saying.
0440237688|4.0|The Giver, by Lois Lowry is a 1994 Newberry Medal winner.  It is a very good book about a 12-year-old boy named Jonas.  He lives in a city were everything is perfect, there is no crime, no sickness, and everyone is given a job. People were not allowed to say anything mean or ask rude questions to people either.  Jonas is selected by the elders of his community to be the receiver of memories, which is a very respected job.  Jonas is given memories of what life was like before the community was made by an old man called the Giver.  It was because of the memories he received that he had his first experiences of snow and even color.  Because Jonas was the giver of memories he had been excused from all restrictions, the community may give to normal citizens. That is how Jonas uncovers the secrets of his \\"perfect\\" community.
B00004VVNB|5.0|\\"Logan's Run\\" is an outdated film of our time, but you have to remember back in the 1970s, they didn't have computer animation.  Anyway, I was engrossed by the story line, the characters, the acting, and of course, the visual effects.  I now consider this film one of my favorites of all time.
B000088E6D|5.0|Tony Good, Dean Better, Micheal the Best. Yes Bubl is Amazing, Michael you are by far the real thing. It's a Frank Sinatra with a voice, it's magic.. The Best CD ever, get this CD.
B00005JMEW|2.0|Tarantino.  He is probably one of the best directors in my opinion.  I really enjoy his movies and was very dissapointed after seeing Kill Bill.  I did not enjoy anything about this movie.  I hate to give Tarantino a bad review cause I enjoy other movies by him so much but man this was a dissapointment.  I can not be entertained by a girl (whose acting i did not think was very good at all) trying to kill a terrible chinese actor.  I liked the weapons but the fight scenes were terrible.  Its ok to have blood squirting out of arms back in the day when Monty Python was making movies but it really made the movie decrease at least two stars.  I thought the plot was a bit childish and the fact that she killed all the men was just stupid.  I did this with my GI Joes and MicroMachines back when i was 5 years old.  I would have to say that this movie is Tarantinos worst.  Sorry to all Tarantino fans for rating this movie bad but i think the only way any one over the age 12 would enjoy this movie is only because they like the director.  Tarantino you are amazing but i can't say anything good about this movie accept that i liked the weapons and the director.  Thats it, sorry to all you Tarantion fans.
B0002IU988|3.0|To be blunt, I still like creed better. Their songs are not bad, but it just lacks that CLICK that you feel when you start to enjoy the album. I just don't have the motivation to listen to the album over and over again like I do to albums I truly enjoy. The good news is that I see potential in this band. Maybe wait til next album...
0141185066|2.0|Since I am seriously considering becoming an English teacher, I decided that I should get a head start on things and read as many classics as I possibly could last summer. \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" happened to be the most difficult one to get through. The story line is quite boring and seems very pointless at times. The book does, however, redeem itself slightly when it is not focusing on the main story line. John Steinbeck writes about the Great Depression from other character's points of view other than the main family the story is focused upon, and he gives some profound insights of his own on this time period every third chapter as well. I would seriously suggest skipping the chapters which contains the main story line, and read the others instead. It would be much more worth your time and sanity.
B00004W50Z|4.0|As it has been documented The Band began their downward spiral on this album.  Compared to the first two landmark recordings, this does pale in comparison. This is also where Robbie Robertson's writing muse began to desert him.  Most of the idiosyncratic chord changes and progressions are gone.  I don't know if Rick Danko could ever give a poor vocal performance, so I'm a little biased.The title track is one of my all time favorites.  I agree wholeheartedly with a previous reviewer, Richard Manuel was the heart and soul musically and spiritualy of this group, as his vocals on 'The Shape I'm In' give testament to. The rest is not groundbreaking material, but damn good nontheless.  Obviously the casual fan doesn't start here, but get here at some point.
B00009V7T2|5.0|This CD is probably one of the best rock CD's I've ever heard, period.  Each of the tracks is so different and these guys are incredibly talented songwriters and musicians.  The lyrics are so different from anything you'll ever hear as they tell a story (they've actually written a short novel about it) of Cerpin Taxt, a fictional character based on a late friend of theirs.  I've had this CD since it came out, and I'm just now giving the review to show how it will endure.  To this day, \\"Roulette Dares\\" and \\"Eriatarka\\" are two of my all-time favorite songs.  Every song is good in its own right, there's Latin flavor, there's some funk flavor, even a slow ballad \\"Televators\\", but one theme is common, and that's rock energy.  I definitely recommend this CD to someone who wants something new, fresh, and exciting.
B00005JN2Z|2.0|This movie was just not near as good as it could have been.  I guess after seeing the previews I just got to built up for it.  When i finally saw it i was dissapointed.  Tom Cruise is a pretty decent actor in my opinion and Jamie Foxx was a big let down.  The acting was definately Tom Cruises worst and Jamie Foxx's acting was just pathetic.  The acting really brought the movie down.  The plot itself was very cool and i couldn't wait to see it.  I was so excited and was so let down by how it ended up.  How much more predictable could the movie have been.  Not much.  It simply could have been so much better and that is why i rate it 2 stars.  When you have something with this much potential then you need to make the movie as good as it can be.  Tom Cruise can do so much better acting and Jamie Foxx should re shoot every scene he was in.  Sorry if you think i'm being rude about the movie but seriously if you don't think the movie could have been so much better then your simply wrong.  It had so much more potential.  If you think the acting is good then you need to watch more movies cause it was terrible.  Definately see the movie (rent only), but never buy it cause its not worth the money you'll pay.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight Club is one of the bravest films of the 90's, it is also one of the best. This DVD does the film justice. The previous edition was near perfect, this one improves upon it in every way. The picture quaility is much better. The sound is improved. And Also, their are loads more special features on the second disk. If you are a fan of this movie, you should definatly pick up this DVD.
B000286RZM|4.0|John Frusciante has always been a unique soul who has persistently captured the hearts of his fans; both with the Red Hot Chili Peppers and as a solo artist. I'm a pretty big fan as well, but I sometimes find myself needing to be in the right frame of mind to fully enjoy his music. Especially his very early solo work, which is undoubtedly some of the most difficult and painful music to endure.  <br /> <br />I absolutely loved To Record Only Water for Ten Days. In fact, it was one of my favorite albums of 2001. So needless to say, I had pretty high expectations for Shadows Collide with People. But I was sadly let down by the approach that was taken with its content. Part of John's charm is that he always opted to go the opposite direction of the RHCP to lean towards a more lo-fi production quality. To Record Only Water for Ten Days, in particular, was layered with a multitude of odd-colored textures and beautiful lyrics. Shadows simply didn't compare.  <br /> <br />To my surprise, though, I became aware that Frusciante was going to release six (seven if you include Shadows Collide with People) albums this year. Well, holy cow! I couldn't wait to hear them all. Especially since I figured it'd be at least three years before I'd have the opportunity to hear new material from John. Characteristically, he has only recorded one solo album per every RHCP album, and with the RHCP taking several years to prepare new material...well, you get the point. <br /> <br />So here we are with the first in a line of many new albums to come, The Will to Death. Upon reading the bio information on John's website about the inspiration for this album, I couldn't help but feel that this was the precise direction for him to go; at least it's the direction in which I wanted him to go. Frusciante, along with multi-instrumentalist friend Josh Klinghoffer, wanted to make The Will to Death sound as though it was recorded in 1971. Using only a 16-track recorder and the flow of life, the two recorded the album in a very short period of time. While not trying to dismiss this album by any means, the songs hint at some very good things to come. <br /> <br />Upon entering the first few songs of the album, it's clear that it's not another lo-fi album, but it`s also not shiny and glossy either. Unlike most of John's solo material, there are more instruments in the mix here; including guitar, drums, bass, keyboards, etc. Additionally, the guitar work is some of John's most mature to date and his keyboard adds a welcome progressive-psych element somewhat similar to the way he played with To Record Only Water for Ten Days. Klinghoffer makes a point to stay extremely consistent with his drumming. Oddly enough, it's one of the highlights of the album, particularly due to the fact that John only used synthetic drums on a large portion of his previous material.  <br /> <br />While fans may be undecided about this new album, I can't help but be a little anxious to hear what else John has in store for us. This is undoubtedly a stronger effort than Shadows Collide, and maybe that's due to John's ability to just let the music fly instead of attempting to overwork things. My only hope is that he continues to both enlighten us with his influences on these albums and that he keeps plugging away at making his own style of music.
0440237688|4.0|The Giver is a very strong book, dealing with many pressures of normal and abnormal life. The main character, Jonas, shows how one can make life better by helping others. Also the lessons of trusting, learning how to cope with pain, and bravery are all shown throughout the book. All of the characters are seen in a very in-depth way, from learning the deepest secrets of the community this book may be fiction, but the story is told with such detail that the town almost becomes real. Lowry truly \\"gives\\" the story of The Giver to everyone with an important lesson to be learned for all.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|The Mars Volta is easily the most innovative and musically talented rock band out there today.  It seems as if At the Drive-In was more of a practice session and a warmup to what they are doing now.  All the talk about Green Day's rock opera is such crap these days, this should be the real rock album of the year.  The musicianship is just amazing on this album.  The only reason I gave it only 4 stars is because I would actually recommend De-Loused in the Comatorium to a newcomer.  It contains more stable songs and structures and is more fast-paced rock driven, and the fact that this CD could be condensed a little, as they seem to get carried away with periods of spacey sounds, but we can forgive that compared with the rest of the CD.  It's nice to see that these guys are constantly trying new stuff and reinventing things rather than sticking with the proven, they really know how to innovate.  However like I said, if you're just starting out with Mars Volta, pick up De-Loused, if you're already a fan, then Frances the Mute is a great follow-up in true Mars style.
B0001ZX0PG|3.0|Wow.  Excellent acting.  I can't even get close to say the acting was bad at all.  This movie was simply just not entertaining.  And also how typical of a plot.  It was so predictable and therefore I was the least bit anxious to see the end of the movie.  I love the actors in the movie and have to say its definately some of the best acting therefore I rated it at 3 stars.  If only they would not have made a movie about some childhood friends whom which one of their daughters died and later on in life they reunite and find the killer.  That is such a typical plot to me and not entertaining.  We know what is going to happen throughout the whole movie and there is no suspense.  That is why it doesn't deserve a star more than 3.  I want to be anxious and excited about the end not board and just waiting for it to happen.  I would recommend seeing the movie, and after i think you'll see how it was so easily predicted and not surprising at all it was.  Once again the acting was extrodinary but you've got to have more than good acting to make the movie excell.  Good acting but boring and predictable movie.
B00000FCBC|5.0|this is a great cd but i recamend for all u hard heavy metal heads do not listin 2 tuesdays gone its like a country song its so bad     some people may say this cd sucks but its way better than st.anger but if u like that kind of metallica type then dont read this
1592400876|4.0|This was a quick and fun read.  If only the people who actually need to read this book would do so.  It drives me crazy when people puralize a word with an apostrophe before the s.  Didn't they pass second grade?  For her next project, maybe Lynne can write a book on basic grammar.  I develop an eye twitch when I get e-mails from my boss signed, \\"If you have any questions, ask Bob or I.\\"  Grrrrr! <br /> <br />I did think Lynne was too hard on people who write \\"it's\\" when they mean \\"its.\\"  After all, this is an exception to a rule.  And in the same vein, it would not be illogical for \\"one's\\" to follow the \\"its\\" rule referred to above.  There are some gray areas and room for indulgence.   <br /> <br />This may be an opinionated and sanctimonious post (and hypocritical if there are any errors), but Lynne really struck a nerve.  And apparently not just with me, either; it was heartening how hard it was to get a copy at the library. <br /> <br />I would recommend at least reading this book, if not buying it.  It wouldn't be bad to have it on hand for reference.   <br />
B0007O38F8|5.0|Honestly I was not a 50 Cent fan before I got this album. After giving every song a few listens I think it's a Classic. I will break it down for you song by song. <br /> <br />02. In My Hood: Beat is not very good but 50 represents for his hood, he's still grimy he doesn't want you to forget that. <br /> <br />03. This Is 50: Another poor beat but 50 still brings it lyrically.     <br /> <br />04. I'm Supposed To Die Tonight: Eminem's production skills are starting to eclipse Dre's. I love the chorus. One of the best songs on the album!    <br /> <br />05. Piggy Bank: B for production, B- for lyrics. Still Hot. <br /> <br />06. Gatman And Robin (Featuring Eminem): Very hot song, hot 16 bars by Eminem, good track. <br /> <br />07. Candy Shop (Featuring Olivia): It's been played out by the radio people, still a good song. <br /> <br />08. Outta Control: It's a club song, I started to like it after the 3rd listen. <br /> <br />09. Get In My Car: This song is fire. No doubt this a banger! <br /> <br />10. Ski Mask Way: Another grimy cut. Hot. 50 takes you back to when he was a stick up kid. 50 can do storytelling rap too. <br /> <br />11. A Baltimore Love Thing: Hot concept song, I didn't know 50 could pull off a song this intelligent. Very good <br /> <br />12. Ryder Music: HOT! hi-tek does lays down a hot beat for 50, you gotta have soul to like this song. <br /> <br />13. Disco Inferno: It's the new In the club. Not quite as good but still a hot song.   <br /> <br />14. Just A Lil' Bit: This song is Fire! Very hot dance cut sick beat Scott Storch is a fool for this one. Should have had a 3rd verse though <br /> <br />15. Gunz Come Out: I'm feeling the hook and the lyrics but man Dre's beat sucks. <br /> <br />16. My Toy Soldier: Hot! Definitely depends on whether you like gangsta or just pop music, you have to be able to appreciate gangsta for a lot of tracks like this and #4 <br /> <br />17. Position Of Power: I love this one. Beautiful track. 50 tells you about thelevel he's on now. <br /> <br />18. Build You Up (Featuring Jamie Foxxx): Hot track! Jamie Fox sings good on the hook. It's a hit no doubt. <br /> <br />19. God Gave Me Style: Beautiful track. I love this one. Some people wont like it because there's no cussing in it, no gangsta in it, 50 shows some appreciation to God. <br /> <br />20. So Amazing (Featuring Olivia): This one is kind of wack, just a cut for the ladies. <br /> <br />21. I Don't Need 'Em: This song is gutta, no flashy stuff in there, just the real. I'm feelin' it. <br /> <br />22. Hate It Or Love It (G-Unit Remix): Hot, every body only has like 4 bars. Buck's verse is the best. <br /> <br />In conclusion you have 2 songs that are just decent and 3 that I think are weak. So the other 16 songs in my opinion are either HOT! or FIRE! Honestly comparing this CD to the last few rap CD's I bought (Nas,Jadakiss) the Massacre is way better. It should go down as a classic album. <br />
0140386335|5.0|Michael Ende has the rare talent of being able to capture the innocence and beauty of a child's world within the pages of a book and make it so colorful and magical that it seems as though instead your staring at a painting or work of art.  <br /> <br />The greatest aspect of the Neverending Story is being able to identify with the characters and share the adventures of their world as though you're right alongside them. From the time when Bastian first opened the book to when he and Atreyu are sitting outside the Silver Sage's palace and gazing at the sky, and then suddenly when Bastian begins to change, there is such emotion in the characters that makes us feel as though they are real, living people and that they might jump from the pages any moment.  <br /> <br />This book is true, pure fantasy; a thrilling adventure and a rewarding read, for people of all ages.
B000002UY5|5.0|This ablum has touched my life in such a way that words cannot explain it.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|I like Kubrick`s Dr Strangelove, so it was nice to hear about the new anamorphic widescreen version (the 40th anniversary). I have always disliked the full frame version because of the visible boom mikes (5 in all). They totally ruin the magic for me, so i was really looking forward to see the movie without them... <br /> <br />However, there is something strange (no pun intended!) about the new anamorphic transfer... I heard rumours about this before i got the disc myself. <br /> <br />If you compare the full frame version (take any of the previously released dvd`s) and the new widescreen version, you will see that the new one is way off center. For an example, go to chapter 18 at 61,53 minutes (the radar screen). In the full frame version, the image is in center, but here it`s clearly off. It`s only slighly cropped on top (about 1,50.1), but a big chunk is missing at the bottom (looks like 1,85.1). Way more has been cut at the bottom than is actually possible on a normal 1.66 crop. Take any scene in the film, and you will see this - it`s very obvious. It seems like the transfer has been made way too high, and 3 boom mikes are still visible on top: <br /> <br />Chapter 5 at 15.09 minutes (very slight) <br />Chapter 15 at 51.10 minutes (pretty bad!) <br />Chapter 22 at 75.02 minutes (very slight) <br /> <br />So what is this? Is the full frame version missing a lot of information on top (justifing the now \\"high\\" framing), or is the new widescreen version a screw up?!? To me, it seems like the latter. If you look at chapter 12 (the battle outside Burpelson air force base) on the full frame disc, you can actually see the \\"edge\\" of the film to the left in some shots, and the round \\"corners\\" can bee seen at top and bottom (use your computer  - your tv set will probably cut off extreme left and right). There is only a sliver less on top in these shots. This indicates that the film is more or less in center on the full frame releases, and that there is very little  information missing. Still, these scenes are cropped like anything else on the 40th anniversary disc - just a little on top, and heavily at the bottom. <br /> <br />This movie was often cropped to 1,85 in theaters, and i really cant see how that could have been done when i see the new transfer. That would for example remove Jack. D. Ripper`s nameplate and Buck Turgidson`s \\"world targets in megadetahs\\" book. I think the movie actually is cropped to about 1,85.1 now - but only at the bottom... <br /> <br />If i crop the full frame version of Dr Strangelove like the Lolita DVD (a proper 1,66.1), it looks much more correct (not so \\"tight\\" at the bottom, and more in center), and all the boom mikes are gone too, so i believe this is how Dr. Strangelove should look when it`s properly framed. If this is the case, i hope Columbia catches the glitch and corrects in on the next release (it has to be a next release then i guess...). <br /> <br />Anyone? <br /> <br />
0385510454|4.0|This was a fun book almost from the beginning.  The plot is not as tightly woven as some of Grisham's books and there are spots where there is a bit too much padding and filler.  But I liked this book, found it hard to put down after the first 100 pages, and liked the ending.  I can't wait for the movie as this book will probably fit well on the big screen.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Great and original movie. Awesome music and timeless love story that is simple and true to the human soul as ever. Nicole is just about one of the most beautiful and captivating women alive. Overall: EXCELLENT!
0451191153|5.0|bias n.- a predisposition to prejudice. <br /> <br />Every negative reviewer of this book I have encountered thus far is infected with just this- a predisposition to be against anyone who speaks out for rationality; against anyone who is not a slavish follower of a seductive creed, such as the creed preaching altruism and the superiority of blind belief to understanding and reason. <br /> <br />I beg everyone to read this book with an objective (not \\"Objectivist\\") mindset; don't compare it to other philosophers you have read, and don't shut your mind against seemingly unorthodox opinions. <br /> <br />I think this is an unmatchable book in the realm of philosophy and ethics. It is brilliantly written and, if you have read Rand's other works, very easily dissectable. It can be a load of fun, even for the stalwart Altruist.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I also, as many others, have seen the stage production more than once.  At that time, no one could have compared to Michael Crawford, but now that I have seen the movie, I only listen to that soundtrack.  Yes, Gerard Butler is not formally trained, but, WOW, his raspy rocky voice comes off so much sexier and manlier it's pathetic.  When he's mad or singing with a booming voice, I hold my breath.  I, unlike the masses, never got into Sarah Brightman, her voice was too operatic for a rock opera.  Yes, I also saw the few mistakes, but they were easy to forgive when one looks at the picture as a whole.  It stirred many emotions especially when the music fit the scene perfectly.  My cheers to all involved.  I wouldn't change a thing!  Also, I thought it was a sham that the costumes and makeup were overlooked at Oscar time.  I will be buying this DVD on May 3rd!
0316172324|1.0|An absolute waste of money.  Not a single mention of how to develop and hone the skills he is touting.
B00000AF98|5.0|This album is another great kiss compilation.  The sound is unique from the 80s era and stands as a very good individual record.  Bruce kulick and Eric Carr do the job very well with dynamic drum solos and excellent guiter riffs.  There are many great songs including:  <br /> <br />Bang bang you - which is similar to love gun but more unique in terms of vocals and guiter variation.   <br /> <br />Crazy nights - this song helped me through many tough times with lyrics like, 'if life was a radio, turn up to the ten!!' <br /> <br />Reason to live - another inspirational song which has a deep meaning and is a statement of the variation of songs on this album. <br /> <br />Much of the material is pauls - who is the backbone and lead of the band (despite what people think) <br /> <br />This album is great and it is a shame that none of the songs were performed by the band on there recent tour.   <br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B0007O38F8|4.0|This cd is a very good cd but no where near Get Rich or Die Tryin.  Personally, this is cd is a good cd from 50 not his best effort.  There are a lot of songs on here that is excellent.  50 never disappoints with his hooks.  The beats are crazy and the songs are very good.  I read and seen a lot of reviews on this site and they're giving him one stars on this cd.  Those people must be haters and crazy.  50 never deserves one star on anything he's on.  The man is a musicial genius and one of the best songwriters out today.  His hooks are the best hooks one will ever hear.  They're so catchy and he just amazes you everything.  This is only his second cd so you can't really say he's a great.  But, he's one of the greatest songwriters of all time.  He knows how to associate himself with talent.  Even Olivia is a good artist.  Giving 50 one star on any of his projects is just absurd and there's got to be some hating going on.  But, to focus on the subject at hand.  The Massacre is a good cd but I expect excellent not good from 50.  Hopefully, he comes back with a true massacre the next time around.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Well, this music is lifeless, boring, unexciting, yet it still finds a way to grate on my nerves more than any of the other girlie brats these days.  I find it extremely useful though as a coaster for any kind of drink.  The cd production plant did a great job on the plastic coating, for that, I give the cd one star.<br /><br />Wake up people -- this stuff is garbage!
B0000067L2|5.0|A landmark in popular music, incorporating so many styles of music into one very strange (and wonderful) brew indeed, from blues to jazz to pop, this album brims with energy, evocative melancholy at times, and a concluding streak of goofy good humor. The majority of the lyrics are from the fertile mind of poet Pete Brown, Jack Bruce's longtime collaborator, shot through with dazzling & haunting images -- \\"Dance the Night Away\\" is especially powerful & otherworldly -- but Martin Sharp's lyrics for \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses\\" are equally wonderful, bright & vivid as the tiles of a Mediterranean mosaic, conveying the mythic essence of The Hero's Journey on several levels at once. These songs have all the sweep & soaring drive of much of the progressive rock that was to emerge on the scene soon after, wrapped up compactly in the form of succinct pop songs. And for those who complain about Ginger Baker's vocals on \\"Blue Condition\\" -- his lugubrious delivery absolutely suits the tone & lyrics of this song; you couldn't improve on it! While the band strives for Big Things, they never fear to grin happily on occasion. All in all, an exceptional album from beginning to end. Highly recommended!
B000001ELR|5.0|Iv been a fan of Kiss for many years now.  I am aware that lots of people have got upset cos ace is not on this album.  Once uv heard the album you'l think ace who?  <br />Vinnies guitar riffs are excellent and well played and eric carr is a far better drummer then peter criss.  The sound of this album is loud and heavy - the stand out tracks being creatures of the night with its heavy drums and thunderous guiter solo and the outstanding ballad (as usual) from paul stanley - i still love you. <br /> <br />All the tracks are very solid and this album is one of the best cds without the original lineup.   <br /> <br />Highly recommended - for any rock fan.
B0000028RR|5.0|I respect other people's opinion saying this album is the worst ever, but I really don't understand why. Any hypocrisies aside, the music is still great, and a good listen. Yeah, they didn't invent the genre, but they did give it a nice push forward. Everyone also says that they're music is painful to listen to. I, being someone who listens to about every kind of music and can listen to some pretty harsh stuff (Captain Beefheart for instance) and enjoy it, think it's beautiful.
B00005JMXX|5.0|Besides the fact the special effects are really terrific. This is a story about survival again all odds. Dennis Quaid along with other actors did a fantastic job of pulling it together. The ending was the icing on the cake.
B0001VWP8I|3.0|\\"Anastacia\\" is a well polished rock arena album.  For example the leading single \\"Left Outside Alone\\" unites all the elements in a good memorable song. Great hook, amazing rhythm and clever lyrics.  \\"Sicked and Tired\\" has middle eastern flavor as many songs, but the vocal delivery of Anastacia is just heaven.  \\"Welcome To My Truth\\" is more mellow than many onther tracks in this album, but the meaning is just superb. In conclusion this is a record well crafted & sung, the only itsy bitsy problem, it's that by the end, you feel a little cheated by monotony and sameness.  But still Anastacia delivers what you paid for.
B000002AP1|3.0|This is a very difficult album to review since i love the stooges and this is probably their most well known album.  unfortunately, it's probably my least favorite.  The removal of Ron Asheton from guitar changed the band's sound so much that they hardly sound like the same band that they did on Funhouse and the first album.  This newer version of the stooges is more limber and athletic than before, but in that I think they lose a lot of their appeal.  On their first two albums, the stooges were a fuzzed out lumbering mess that sounded like they literally crawled out of a detroit body shop.  On \\"Raw Power,\\" they're just a tad too sophisticated.  Also, Iggy's changed a lot.  On \\"Funhouse\\" he was commanding without really trying, but here it's like he's screaming \\"look at meeee!\\"  Maybe it was the Bowie influence or maybe it was just his own ego, but either way I liked Iggy the annonymous lunatic better than i liked iggy the lunatic rock star.  The rock star pretensions hurt songs like \\"Penetration\\" and \\"Gimme Danger\\" which sound too much like The Doors (a band i despise) for my tastes.  Still, \\"Search And Destroy\\" is probably the best song the stooges ever recorded (\\"I Wanna Be Your Dog\\" is a verrry close second in my opinion) which puts it very high on the list of best songs ever recorded by any band, and the rest of the album is no slouch.  Even the worst songs aren't bad; they just aren't the stooges i remember.  So, in conclusion, this is a great album, but if you're looking for the truly classic stooges sound, i'd start off with \\"Fun House\\" and the self titled album as \\"Raw Power\\" is really more of Iggy's first solo album than the true work of rock's sleaziest, most powerful band
B0001XAPY2|5.0|This is really a gorgeous movie, like all Studio Ghibli offerings. Having read the reviews and commentary that Miyazaki was aiming at businessmen, I bought this for me - however , my 4 year old daughter loves this movie as much as she loves Kiki's Delivery Service. There is nothing too scary, and there are enough jokes and great flying scenes to not only keep my daughter's attention, but also for her to demand to see it again and again.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|I wanted to see this in theatre from the moment I saw the trailer. The very idea of my favorite actress and my favorite up-and-comer was an irresistible combination. However, this usually means that I am setting myself up for failure or disappointment (expecting too much); so I waited anxiously for _Closer's_ release. I have to say first that I was terrified by the reviews and reports of people leaving the theater early and demanding their money back. However, now I that I have seen the movie, I can clearly say that those people either did not pay attention to the movie's subject before deciding to see it, or they left their brains at home that day. The film was excellent. Portman and Owen were brilliant and heartbreaking almost to the point that I would say they were robbed of the Oscars (Portman was, I have not seen MDB yet). Roberts and Law were very good as well, although their parts were not as likeable (on purpose, they were the \\"bad guys\\") or intricate as the other two. This is another classic example of how a good supporting cast can make a film, and one of the first films I have seen where it seems that the supporting characters were more important than the leading ones. Anyway, the storyline is simple: tragedy in love, but the ending does provide some absolution, for the likeable characters at least. But it is the acting that will be remembered, the heartbreak in Portman's face, and Julia's sad eyes always begging for an answer or a way out. Owen's forcible way of dealing with things, with simmers of hurt shinning through. If you look through the bad language and zooming narrative, this film will be a gift.
B0006MT314|5.0|this soundtrack is a must have. it's the only cd that has both \\"when the stars go blue\\" by tyler hilton and bethany joy lenz AND the acoustic version of tyler's song \\"glad!\\" (gavin's also a big plus!!) allllso, if you haven't gone to a one tree hill gig, then you're really missin out as well... it's by far one of the best tours that i've ever been to! and while i'm at it... you should pick up tyler's album the tracks of b/c it's the best cd that's came out within the past year! trust me on that one! :D
B00028HBL6|5.0|I bought this film as soon as it became available, and I treasure it. <br />I thought, as I first sat in the theater to view \\"The Passion of the Christ\\", that I was going to have problems with the subtitles and Aramaic/Latin dialogue. I was soon disabused of that notion, as the brilliant cinematography and acting swept me into a story that I thought I knew well. Those things which Mel Gibson added to the scriptural accounts only served to enhance them, making them come alive in a new and beautiful way. <br />I was especially touched by the interplay between Jesus and his mother, which gave us the only 'comic relief' of the film when we saw the young adult Jesus and his mother in the carpentry shop. <br />This is truly a must-see film - whether it's the original or the recently trimmed version.
B0002YLC24|5.0|Before sunset is a beautiful film, because it does what few films do- it actually captures the experience of rekindling romantic love.  <br /> <br />Every generation has a contribution to the canon of great films. Future filmgoers will see this as a classic that is gen x's contribution to great screen romances. It is right up there with \\"An Affair To Remember\\", \\"Marty\\", \\"Love Story\\", \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" and \\"The Way We Were\\". It is that good.  <br /> <br />I saw \\"Before Sunrise\\" 9 years ago and identified with the characters, who were the same age as me. Though I wanted to see what happened to these characters after they left each other in vienna, I never thought that any sequel would be as good. I was wrong. \\"Before Sunset\\" was even better than its predeccessor.  <br /> <br />As a sequel, this film is comparable to \\"The Emprire Strikes Back\\" - a film that both expands upon and surpasses the original.....  <br />
B00007GZQI|3.0|Totally fab. American writer Terry Southern takes potshots at the English class system, with the odd bit from Pythons Cleese and Chapman and a hip ensemble cast. Any movie that features Raquel Welch in a \\"Ben Hur\\" parody and has Yul Brynner crooning \\"Mad About the Boy\\" in full drag to Roman Polanski has an inexplicable kind of anarchy. (And then ... there's Ringo's acting.) There's not any real plot other than that of \\"a fool and his money\\" variety, but the music's great period pieces -- Badfinger's \\"Come and Get It,\\" and Thunderclap Newman's \\"Something in the Air\\" -- keep popping up to remind you this is swinging London. Unfortunately, the movie is long overdue for a digital clean-up; at this point, it's been neglected so long the print looks like a bootleg, and maybe that's part of its campy charm.  As social satire the movie is pretty scattered, but as a textbook for future set designers (\\"Austin Powers,\\" I'm looking in your direction) this is the genuine article.
B0001DI0FI|3.0|I managed to squeak out 3 stars on this baby primarily because of the fabulous effort of the movie to portrait the proud sail warships and the excellent battle scenes ... but .. thats about as far as it goes ....  <br /> <br /> <br />Any simillarity to REAL history and what life was like on these war ships is purely coincidental. The images of life, aboard as a sailor or an officer are way way off. A captiain that is pleasant to the officers and sailors... I dount it .. a Dr suggesting all the rum be thrown overboard ... I doubt it ... The Doctor operating on himself for bullet wounds without anesthetic .. doubt it .. Brit captain gets stabbed by the French Captain and they let the French gut live .. i really really doubt it .... A captian and the DR playing a 2 string duet ... give me a break OK please Hollywood Im gonna scream with the PC stupidity ...  <br /> <br /> <br />If you  want to see real life fabulous true depiction of the times on a sailboat during the British/French wars then for goodness sakes buy the Horatio Hornblower DVD set ... Now ther's a series that worth 10 stars if Amazon had them .... <br />
B0007P3582|1.0|This hip hop disc is an exercise in poor taste and poor choices. Surely, it lacks creativity and has nothing constructive to say about bettering our world. Bad attitude; bad music; bad idea. Drugs, sex and weapons? Please, keep this stuff to yourself!!! <br />Bring a message of hope to the people!
B000002KBU|5.0|This woman has been around for years. I have not, but a week ago i emerged from this supposed cave I lived in because I have never heard of her. BLUE has been in my cd player for seven days now and I can promise it will be for at least seventy years. I am completely overwhelmed by it. Completely touched and charmed. Joni Mitchell's words speak to you like your first love. I adore BLUE and I hope the ones who has still to experience her will do so soon. Climb out of your cave and be enchanted.
B0007DAZW8|2.0|for those of you looking for another \\"Discovery,\\" you will be very disapppointed.
B0000DKKY4|5.0|I have the American domestic version of The Very Best of Cat Stevens (which I lost this weekend, along with three other Cat CDs, and will need to replace). I just compared this playlist to that on the case of my American version, to see if the \\"4 Bonus Tracks\\" were worth the higher price.  <br /> <br />I was surprised to discover that this is nothing like the American \\"The Very Best of Cat Stevens\\"! An important aspect of the American \\"The Very Best of Cat Stevens\\" is that the songs are in CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER, and that it includes the previously unreleased \\"...Seeing My Grandson Grow Old\\".  <br /> <br />This Import CD's playlist is almost identical to another Import \\"Remember Cat Stevens: Ultimate Collection\\", except for two songs. (This substitutes \\"Sad Lisa\\" and \\"How Can I Tell You,\\" both beautiful songs.) Compared to the domestic version (for half the price), this has 8 additional songs but omits 4 songs.  <br /> <br />This IS a very good collection. It includes two of the Harold & Maude songs. But you can get all the Harold & Maude songs on my favorite Cat CD, Footsteps in the Dark, currently a real bargain at $9.98. <br /> <br />
B000089RV6|5.0|I think that this is definetly a must-have. Since the new singer, Brian Johnson stepped in, everybody, even including the band, was pretty doubtful. These songs show AC/DC in their true color, and what I mean is that when you hear a song from this album, you'll know that it's Angus's blaring solo on You Shook Me All Night Long, or the classic Back in Black. On the other hand, listening to songs on Who Made Who, or Fly on the Wall, you can't really tell who is playing. <br /> <br />This album is great. My personal favorites are Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution, Hells Bells, and all of them except Shake a Leg. To be honest, I think Shake a Leg is the filler here. <br /> <br />Please buy this album. This is definetly a must-have.
0743216458|4.0|This book is one of those that once you get into it, you just fly through it.  It is a very interesting story that just flows from chapter to chapter.  I am sure this could have been much longer, but it really hits highlights, except for Bastogne which it went into some detail about.  A couple reviews criticize this book for glorifying Easy company, but how can you say that--the book is about them and they were a great company.  The book is  not the whole US army. If it were...well that is another story.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|Once again, \\"critics\\" have influenced me to miss a cinematic adventure I should have experienced in the movie theater. Praise the gods for DVD! TROY is far and beyond my expectations. So let's compare the critics to the movie: <br />1) It doesn't make the war last ten years so its not faithful to Homer. Hey, Was Homer there??? I don't think so. The War's progession is logical to battle and works with the story. So the \\"brevity\\" of the War is no big deal. <br />2) The gods aren't in this so the purpose and the motivation of The Illiad is lost. OK, so the gods aren't flying around like a Ray Harryhausen flick (many of which I am very fond of). The gods are spoken of and discussed, developing characterization and motivation. They are unseen, except as idols: isn't that more realistic? <br />3) Brad Pitt doesn't work as Achilles. Absolutely untrue. When Pitt puts on his helmet, his eyes take on a wild animal glare. Otherwise, his looks work surprisingly well for Achilles, because he has an unusual face. He is certainly believable as a classical Greek demi-god. <br />4) Diane Kruger isn't beautiful enough to launch a Thousand Ships. Come on! Who in reality is? This Helen is really hot! Give her a break. <br />5) Orlando Bloom doesn't impress. Ditto as said for Brad Pitt. Orlando looks his best since his LOTR glory days. He is a GREAT Paris. And he even gets to use his archery skills again. <br />6) Troy is a disappointment. On the contrary, I found it both epic and thoughtful. Peter O'Toole gets decent screen time and is wonderful. Eric Bana humanizes Hector and thereby contrasts him with Achilles, who remains somewhat aloof and superhuman. The death scene of Achilles is ingenious as it creates a believable assumption for his mythic demise. Overall, I could only ask for a longer film.
B0007ORU66|4.0|This was one of my first LP's i'd ever owned.  Found it in Europe- late 70's I think - at a street market.  Had a lot of songs I could never find back in the 70's.  They are as follows: <br />SIDE ONE:  <br /> <br />          Can't Buy Me Love <br />          I Should Have Known Better <br />          Paperback Writer <br />          Rain <br />          Lady Madonna <br />          Revolution <br /> <br />SIDE TWO: <br /> <br />          Hey Jude <br />          Old Brown Shoe <br />          Don't Let Me Down <br />          Ballad of John & Yoko <br /> <br /> <br />All produced by George Martin, all recorded in England. <br />The cover picture is of the fab4 standing in front of a door of a very large house, all looking much older and free from grooming.  The back cover pictures them on the back lawn of the house, 2 standing - 2 sitting on the grass.  Will try scanning covers and sending them in to view. <br />The songs are timeless, the sound is rich and full.  Wouldn't want to be with out this one.
B0007P3582|4.0|50's latest joint \\"The Massacre\\" was made to \\"lock down the block\\" AKA The Music Industry. The street cuts are just that-->street. The commercial joints--->just that. Someone here said 50's track \\"Don't Need'Em\\" rips off Ghostface's \\"Metal Lunges\\". For real, \\"The Pretty Toney Album\\" was TOTAL TRASH. The attempt to bring back the \\"soul\\" was good but this guy did'nt even try to chop the records up, and Ghost's attempt to harmonize SUCK!! (Tryin to do that 50 technique!!). Overall, \\"The Massacre\\" is a hell of a good listen and it \\"locks down the block\\", wait for #3!!!
0743454537|2.0|The only reason I give it more than one star is that the premise upon which the story was based was an interesting one.  But that's where my appreciation ends.  Aside from being about 200 pages too long, the most disturbing fact was that all of the character's voices sounded exactly the same.  I continually had to go back to the start of the chapter to figure out who was talking b/c the mother sounded like Anna who sounded like the Dad who...you get the point.  I also found myself getting annoyed because no matter how bright they may be, 13 year olds aren't nearly as insightful and philosphical as Anna was.  And to be quite honest, neither are most adults!  And that lack of authenticity made the entire story implausible.  I was more irritated than moved by the subplot about the brother that ended up going nowhere and the ending.... come ON!   <br /> <br />If My Sister's Keeper is an accurate representation of Picoult's work, I think I've had my fill.
6305910340|5.0|This is one of Laurence Fishburne's best films even though there are no guns, car chases, or sex.  Fishburne's character is one of quiet strength.  He befriends a child prodigy in the chess world and teaches him lessons in chess and in life.  This is not a large role nor does \\"Fish\\" have much screen time but when he's on the screen he is captivating.  His role is one of quiet strength but great power.  Josh Waitzkin (the child chess champ) fears not only losing the chess championship but his father's love as well.  Josh trains with Bruce Pandolfini (Ben Kingsly) who himself has his own demons to deal with.  The two teachers don't see eye to eye on chess strategies and that puts Josh in the middle.   <br /> <br />You also have the situation of Josh's father who is living vicariously through his son.  Hence, every time Josh wins a trophy, dear old dad puts it in the living room on the mantle instead of in Josh's room where they belong.  Don't let this subject matter scare you away.  You don't have to know how to play chess to enjoy this movie.  It's about the relationships that Josh develops along the way to becoming a grandmaster.  Much of the charm in this film is due to the acting of the newcomer Max Pomeranc.  An innocent face and great big brown eyes that you can't help but emphasize with. <br /> <br />It's heartwarming, funny and sad but also a very powerful film.  This is a real story about real people by the way.  At the time this film was made I believe that Josh was about 18 years old and ranked #1 in his division.  Please watch this film with your kids.  You just may learn a little chess!
B00006GO9Q|5.0|For a artist that has produced something in the region of 70+ Albums, and amongst that high volume of studio/Live albums, are some of the most inspired & Defining albums that Jazz music has to offer.  So how do you go about picking the best of his work??......Well, firstly, do you have both \\"Sketches of Spain\\" & \\"Kind of Blue\\"..??, if not....then you need to stop reading this review and add those two albums to your 'Miles Davis' shopping list.  Now I'm not saying that \\"Sketches of Spain\\" & \\"Kind of Blue\\" are the absolute best albums Miles Davis has ever made (Miles enthusiast's & Purists, will probably argue that's not the case).  But what nobody can argue against is the fact that they are both not only perfect starting points for beginners & first time listeners, but also no real Miles Collection, can really be called \\"Complete\\" without them......so, have you got those albums now??, great!!....now we'll begin. <br /> <br />In a silent Way, is a perfect synthesis of Miles fusing Jazz, with the soothing and intimate solitude of warm electronics (Organ, Guitar), It almost feels like a wordless subtle folk album, that have been marvellously brought up to date for a more broad-minded audience.  It's an album that's broken down into two distinct parts, with \\"Shhh/Peaceful\\" being the more reflective and intimate of the two pieces, it's truly amazing how the warmth of \\"Joe Zawinul's\\" organs creates a mood, in which there isn't a melody as such, not even a melodic frame as such by which everything musically hangs from, it's more a creating of ambiance and shimmering sounds. There are nothing more than grooves layered on top of another set of grooves which create dream like passages over which Miles contributes fragments of trumpet, to emphasise the mood.  For me, this is Miles at some of his most restrained & delicate, and It's Miles and McLaughlin, sparing performances that seems to connect, breathing delicately from the trumpet entering into a level of hushed phrases andpassages. The groove here is one, that this is dark & smoky,  but never in a menacing or ominous way, it's probably has more right, as music to chill/ unwind to, as a Jazz music has any right to.  As expressive as the finest electronica, and as graceful as the most beautiful ambient music, this has to be (in my humble opinion), some of the most affecting & articulate instrumental music ever. <br /> <br />\\"In a Silent Way\\", (Part two), although not quite a complete U-Turn in dynamics, feels more lively and the performances here are more invigorated, although not to the point of losing the subtlety of whats trying to be achieved here, more that  (with the superb intergration of  guitar), it gives the music a more open quality, like a piece of music with has no strict boundaries, yet feels coherent, with keyboards swelling to fill the gaps in the instrumentation perfectly and Dave Holland's paces everything along. When the first round of solos ends, and it remains arguably as soothing as the first half of the disc, just in a more engaging way, as the use of electric instruments feel more utilised here, to magnificent effect.  And the way that the band swells in orchestration and then takes the tune and brings it down the barely more than a whisper with ethereal organ fading in and out of silence, is on occasion breathtaking. <br /> <br />For me (Personally), I have to say that this truly is one of the most breathtaking Jazz albums, I've had to pleasure to sit through.  Nobody's saying for a minute that this is the best Jazz (or indeed Miles Davis) album, ever made.  No, what I'm trying to convince you of, is the fact that this is a Jazz album, that is so utterly stepped in gentle ambience and downtempo moods, that it shows that not all music that could be considered \\"Chill-out\\" has to be from the Electronica Genre. Its manages to maintain that element of groove and toe-tapping rhythm, that only the best Jazz Music can invoke in a listener, but it's mood is so subtle &considered that it's more a rare form of contemplative mood music than it is Jazz.  Sure, It goes without saying that Miles Davis fans (either Casual / Hardcore / Passing / general fans), must have this breath-taking effort in their collection.  But I'd even go say far as to extend this recommendation to anyone that is either into Ambient, downtempo instrumental music, or Chill-out Electronica....that wants to try something a little different, as they really should allow themselves to sample this album, and I truly can't argue the case for this incredible album strongly enough.

As controverial and relevant as Dr. Stranglove was to the cold war, this film tackles the Nazy Holocaust with wit, care and irony.

B0006SSOHC|5.0|This film is a creepfest on par with Silence of the Lambs.  The writers [and killer] burrow into your mind.  How do you outwit a serial killer who has eluded the police for years and who has never actually killed anyone himself?  How far do you trust someone that you just met when his death could mean your freedom?  What are you truly capable of if your loved ones are in danger?  The more that you learn of the protagonists' predicament and the pure evil of their tormentor the more your skin crawls.  You'll be looking over your shoulder in dark parking garages after this movie.

B00007G207|5.0|I first saw this movie in a college film class that emphasized the relationship between film and music. Immediately, it became my favorite film. The finale is the best thing I've ever seen portrayed in film. We watched it the first time without volume, and it was good in itself. But when we watched it again with the music there was not a dry eye in the room. I've seriously watched it over 100 times, and it never looses it's beauty. To anyone who hasn't seen this film, please do! And if you don't agree, and it doesn't bring you to tears than there is sometging seriously wrong.
B00000DGRX|5.0|Deep Purple's \\"Machine Head\\" is indeed a 'classic' It has to be one of the top 10 albums of all time. How is 'classic' defined? We all have our own definitions. It is not as aggressive and powerful as \\"In Rock\\" nor as experimental as \\"Fireball\\". It's just better. Anyone who loves rock music knows of Ritchie Blackmore's guitar wizardry. And the powerful B-3 of Jon Lord. When the intro to \\"Highway Star\\" starts out with it's bass, then guitar, then Ian Gillan's screams you know this is no wimpy music. You like guitar? Blackmore's solo builds up to a run that is so fast and tasteful it defies the ears. \\"Smoke on the Water\\"? Who hasn't played air guitar to this riff? It's simplicity is what makes it so great. Many people may be impressed by shredders like Malmsteen and Vai, but Blackmore (who can certainly shred) creates solos that have texture and style. You like B-3's? This album is for you, too. Just listen to \\"Lazy\\". No cheezy synths on this album.<br /><br />  The remixed disc doesn't offer much extra except an extended drum intro to \\"Pictures of Home\\" and a bit different guitar solo in \\"Smoke on the Water\\". Interesting, but not essential. Too bad this lineup would just release one more album before they split.<br /><br />  This remastered version is like a sonic boom to the ears. Listen through headphones to enjoy every nuance this cd has to offer.
B000002UZ1|5.0|However, to understand this album is to recognize its place in the Beatles canon when initially released in 1973. Although marketed internationally, this double-LP served as the first UK greatest hits package for the latter years of the Beatles. Just as the UK released in 1966 the greatest hits package \\"Collection of Beatles Oldies\\" without a U.S. counterpart, the semi-compilation \\"Hey Jude\\" was released in the U.S. without a UK counterpart. As such, \\"1967-1970\\" functioned not only as a greatest hits package internationally, but as the first album to feature for UK fans such singles-only releases as \\"Hey Jude,\\" \\"Revolution,\\" \\"Get Back\\" (single version), and \\"Ballad Of John and Yoko,\\" as well as B-sides \\"Don't Let Me Down,\\" and \\"Old Brown Shoe.\\" Also, the LP  \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" was only released as a 45 rpm double-EP in the UK (until the late-70s)--so, likewise, this was the first album release for the \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" tracks (which take up much of disc 1) for UK fans who didn't buy the imports. Another point of interest: the last 3 tracks were actually recorded in 1968, prior to the 1969 \\"Abbey Road\\" tracks, but placed in this order according to \\"Let It Be\\"'s release date of 1970. Since \\"Let It Be\\"'s actual recording year wasn't generally known by the general public until long after 1973, the track-placement decision was probably made to avoid confusion at the time.    All in all, I've always found the 1967-1970 album to be an aesthetically appealing package, as well as the 1962-1966 album. I've also liked the packaging of both for their unsensationalized, formalized presentation. The Beatles probably deserved such treatment at the time, too--especially after US Capitol's previous tendency to fill their jackets of early releases with banter and hyperbole. By comparison to its conjunctive album, though, 1962-1966 is somewhat wanting on tracks. The \\"red album\\"'s original side two only contained six two-three minute songs, while the \\"blue album\\"'s side two contained seven songs, including 5 minute + \\"I Am the Walrus\\" and \\"Hey Jude.\\" Nor was 1962-1966's short overall time expanded with its CD release. As such, whereas I wouldn't recommend 1962-1966 at the price it sells for, I would recommend 1967-1970.
B000066NW0|4.0|I'm not one for pop music but this one caught my ear. I have no idea why it struck me as so catchy but it did and I couldn't help myself from buying it. Avril Lavigne is what I've heard people call pop punk. I think I would beg to differ. I would call this more pop rock than pop punk. It's got a lot more edge than any of your Britney's or Christina's, yet also has a certain amount of depth in a few songs. For being so young when Ms. Lavigne wrote this, I think she did a very good job. Sure at times the lyrics are childish, but other songs more than make up for it.<br /><br />This CD starts off with the wonderfully addictive Losing Grip. This is easily one of the best songs on here. The lyrics are especially good on this song and Avril delivers them without a hitch. The instrumentation is also at a high point on this track. I was sad to see that there's only one other song like this, Unwanted. I feel Avril pulls off these types of songs very well and she has a great voice to back it up. Unwanted, like I said, is the only other rock song on here. As with Losing Grip, this contains very good lyrics and are sung very well. I personally love Avril's voice, it's not a typical pop voice, she has the ability to go from singing to melodic yelling and this song proves that. Tomorrow is a slow song that doesn't follow in the treaded path of normal pop ballads. It's as emotional as you get on here and her voice sounds particularly sincere. The lyrics aren't too shabby but they're nothing amazing, she's done better. Naked is a nice closer to this CD. Her voice is complimented extremely well by the soft beat which accompanies.<br /><br />A couple of my favorite songs are Losing Grip, Unwanted, Tomorrow, Too Much To Ask, and Naked. While this CD isn't worthy of a straight listen through, it has it's amazing songs that make up for the filler. This is a worthy debut CD from an extremely talented girl. In an age where you're either pop or rap, Avril begins to tread a new path for pop vocalists to follow. Here's hoping she doesn't go stale on us.pop vocalists to follow. Here's hoping she doesn't go stale on us.

0767834739|5.0|I, unlike a lot of people, found this to be a very enjoyable movie. The thing I think few people take into consideration is the fact that Alexander Witt probably didn't set out to break new ground, all this film does is build on what we were left with in Resident Evil. The special effects are tremendous, a lot more detailed than the first one. The acting in a few scenes is a bit shallow but this is an action movie, of course it's not going to have great acting throughout the duration of the film. The exception to that statement is Sienna Guillory who plays the gorgeous Jill Valentine. I can't think of a single person who could play Jill as well as she did. She seems to have settled into the role with ease. And we can't forget the amazingly talented Milla Jovovich reprising her role as Alice. To watch her fight and shoot is pure exhileration. She also has become so much tougher in this one due to the injections of the T Virus she was given.<br /><br />This movie starts off with a brief recap of what happened in the first film, other than that it picks up right where it left off. The plot is as follows. Racoon City has become a garden of rapidly growing numbers of undead. The Umbrella Corporation has taken it upon itself to quarantine the city, this means building a massive wall that circles the entire city. No one gets in, no one gets out. We are then thrust into heart pounding action sequences and all the things you loved about the first film. The small group we, the viewers, follow consists of Alice, Jill, Carlos, and Dr. Ashford's daughter. They must get to a designated building to then climb effortlessly onto a helicopter and fly off into the sunset. Things don't go as planned, however, and chaos ensues.<br /><br />The lead characters couldn't have been cast better, Milla and Sienna's chemistry is evident and meshes very well. The addition of Jill Valentine was a good call and I feel that the franchise will be carried out very well with Jill being the main character.<br /><br />The special features are surprisingly a nice little bonus. We get a ton of behind-the-scenes footage and interviews as well as 20 deleted scenes. Normally I'm not one for special features but the things included in this are done well. We are also treated to a few trailors to other films.<br /><br />Overall this movie is worthy of the name Resident Evil. It follows the game very well and the characters are represented very well. This is a must for any fan of the genre and also any fans of the game.aracter. <br /> <br />The special features are surprisingly a nice little bonus.

B000683VI4|5.0|There is really only one thing to say about this movie. I really believe it is as close to perfect as it can get. I know there are probably alot of people who disagree, but I dont know why.This movie was exceptionally good.I havent cried this much in my life.I mean there hasn't been such a good love story/tearjerker out since Titanic.I doubt there will be a better one in the future.The Notebook is definately a great movie that I think you should really see.I know so many guys who saw this and left crying.You dont see that alot,do you?I really think everyone should give this movie a shot. It is really a wonderful love story.Sure,it's more of a girl movie,but I bet every guy could sit through it  and actually enjoy it.Well, I hope this helped in anyway.It should because I'm telling you to go out and buy this movie...NOW! And now I am done because what I wrote really seems gay.But I really am serious,this is a good movie that you are not going to want to miss out on seeing.I just got it today and I think I am going to watch it again,except this time I will have kleenex!
B000059TEP|5.0|As one of the very fist movies I'd ever seen and understood as a child, Ghost is very close to my heart. <br />The acting and cinematography are amazing (those graphics were HARDCORE in the old days), and the emotions you feel as you watch the story unfold are as well. A movie that can make you laugh, cry, and have faith in eternal love are all the elements I need to be satistfied. Ghost provides all three.
B00005JN0T|1.0|The movie starts off with our \\"lovable\\" action hero Will Smith waking up from bed completley nude. We can tell right off the bat that this is a typical Will Smith ego film fest. The story is good enough, but the fact that WIll Smith is just a \\"    \\" bag, (you fill in the blank) makes this movie unwatchable. A good movie about Man vs Machine is the anime \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" or Blade Runner. I-Robot done in another way with another lead actor would have propelled it further.
B00005JN2Z|1.0|I thought my sobriety was impeding my ability to enjoy this \\"film\\"-after all, I heard so many great things about it, and my goodness!!! Jamie Foxx was even nominated for supporting actor!! So I had a beer..watched some more, and just got angrier. I like dumb movies, really, but when dumb movies try to look smart, I just can't stand it.  If you couldn't figure out where this was headed after the first \\"hit\\" by Tom Cruise, maybe you should swallow a bullet yourself and save your neighborhood dog-catcher the trouble. This movie should have been 20 minutes long. Let me put it this way-if you don't get agitated with the scene where the cops pull over Jamie and Tom, chances are you are a moron-enjoy the film. The rest of you-check out a film by Michael Mann that doesn't suck-\\"Heat\\". I could watch that movie with the sound off and enjoy it a million times more than this Hollywood drivel.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|Jabba the Hutt is given a face lift in this edition, and there are commentaries throughout all three movies.  Almost like having six movies into the bargain.  I wish Carrie Fisher would of spoken more in the commentary, especially in ROTJ.  There are interviews which include Peter Jackson in the Bonus Disk.  I played Star Wars Battlfront for the first time from the Bonus Disk.  It was great.

B0007DAZW8|3.0|unlike the other reviewer said, this album does not \\"go back to daft punks roots\\" and it did NOT take 4 years to make. They only spent six weeks in the fall of 2004 working on this, which it says right on the CD insert. The sound of this album falls somewhere between Homework and Discovery, but with a very raw feel over all. The majority of the tracks are VERY repeditive unlike Discovery, but even lack some of the charm that Homeworks repeditive tracks had. Not to mention there are only 9 songs on the album, with \\"on/off\\" just being a 19 second lead in to \\"television rules the nation\\".  <br /> <br />    The best tracks are probably \\"Human After All\\" which has the most variance of all the song on the album, \\"Robot Rock\\" which is their first single, it has an awesome sound but lacks any variance, and \\"technologic\\" which is very catchy as well, somewhat similar to \\"Harder Better Faster Stronger\\". the two slow tracks an the album are pretty good as well if you like that kind of thing, which I do. The other tracks may leave you wanting more, or may even just be not so good. For instance \\"The Prime Time of Your Life\\" starts out very promising and then suddenly at two minutes the song ends and there is just another 2 minutes of wind down. <br /> <br />   It seems clear to me that a lot of these tracks, even including the single, are begging to be remixed, and knowing how little time they put in to this, and what their recent trends have been, I think that Is just what Daft Punk wants us to do.

B00000F5UZ|4.0|\\"Resident Evil: Apocalypse\\" is to be recommended to those who enjoy good action films. The movie has some breathtaking action and fight sequences that are nearly non-stop (Along with the unnecessary blood and gore, which seriously detracts from the film). The best thing about the film is Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory. They can look incredible and kick serious behind at the same time. Their beauty and guts give the film a great boost! Fans of films like \\"Aliens\\" and the \\"Terminator\\" trilogy will truly enjoy this one, while others may be turned off by the graphic violence. Whatever your view, \\"Resident Evil: Apocalypse\\" is a non-stop action epic that is sure to entertain. Grade: B+
B00008PW2D|4.0|I'm really behind the ball here only half way through the season before the last. The tone is different. One (Samantha) is easing out of the only monogamous relationship she ever had. One (Charlotte) is waiting for Mr. Right to knock on her door after marrying Mr. Wrong. One (Miranda) is a little chubby (oh my god) from having a baby & is just too tired & not in the mood. Carrie has decided she doesn\\"t need men. Either they are getting older, which they are or they've gone through the entire male population of Manhattan.   <br />   This show may be one of the best things ever on cable (The Sopranos excepted) but their shtick is wearing thin & is less creditable. We have four still gorgeous women galloping towards middle age, still relationship-phobic. Six years is probably enough.
B0007O38F8|1.0|50 Cent forced his way into our consciousness and our wallets because of his undeniable charisma and the amazing collection of beats and hooks on 2002's Get Rich or Die Trying.  Sure, he was not the lyrical equal of Jay-Z, Rakim, Biggie, Tupac, or even Jadakiss, Nas, or Ja Rule, but something about him made us listen whether we loved him or hated him. <br /> <br />Well.  This is a big backslide, sonically and lyrically.  The lyrics are insipid, not inspired, the beats are tired retreads, for the most part (\\"Disco Inferno\\" is essentially Lloyd Banks' \\"On Fire\\"; \\"Candy Shop\\" is essentially \\"Magic Stick\\"), and the production is so subpar, one would think Dre and Eminem phoned it in. <br /> <br />There is no wicked humour, playful banter, or anything approaching levity on this disc of twenty-odd tracks; it's a laborious process trying to slog through the infantile put-downs (who cares whether \\"In da Club\\" outsold \\"Lean Back\\"?), references to his sexual prowess, analogies between his magic stick and his automatic pistol, and slack-jawed delivery. <br /> <br />For Dre and Em, this must have been an intentional gag reel, and the lyrical greats of the past twenty years are either shaking their heads in dismay, or spinning in their graves.  Save your money, download \\"Candy Shop,\\" and call it a day.

B0002F6AZC|5.0|I have loved this movie since I was 5! Creepshow 2 contains a gorgeuos animated wraparound featuring a talkative creep and a kid that is a real horror fiend that runs in with a bully that looks like Jerry Only from the \\"Misfits\\"! The stories aren't as diverse as the first, but suprisingly good acting and one of the best horror movie soundtracks that I have ever heard really make this sequel far better than the first. It also stars Jeremy Green- THE most beutiful woman in the world! I totally recommend this extremely underrated masterpiece. <br />
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I had seen the Phantom on stage and heard the original cast recording.  this movie outdoes them all.  Not only does it have fabulous cinemathology, but the acting is superb by both Rossum and Butler, the chemistry between the two of them has you spinning in your seat and rooting for the phantom the entire time.  Butler portrays him in such a compassionate way that you can not help but like him even when he kills.  The music, of course, is fabulous and makes your soul soar.  Emmy's voice is spectacular and matches with the rawness of Gerard's voice perfectly..Webber definatly knew what he was doing when he cast the two of them.  This is a must-see for all music lovers and romantics.

1594200106|5.0|THE SHADOW OF THE WIND takes a line of betrayal, lost friendship, hatred, love, and dreams that lived in the shadow of the wind. It is a touching homage to the mystical power of books that serve as mirrors to offer us what already carry inside us. Very few novel like the one in question powerfully illustrates how a book can incite sentiment buried deep inside our heart that only become unleashed at a certain time and at a certain stage of life's walk, upon the stimulation of a message.<br /><br />For Daniel, the son of a Barcelona bookseller, Julian Carax's novel seems to be waiting for him even before his birth on the shelf of the clandestine Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a most best-kept secret of the city. It is a library tended by the city's guild of rare-book dealers as a repository for books forgotten by the world, waiting for someone, a dedicated bibliophile, who will care about them and relish them again. Destiny is for sure at work regardless of whether it is Daniel who chooses Julian Carax's book or the book itself does choose him. The mystery Daniel yet to demesmerize, peel by peel, strip by strip, layers by layer, ineluctably binds people from chance encounter in life together through a strange chain of destiny.<br /><br />The bookseller, Daniel's father, initiates his son into the secret of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books to console him of his despondency over the loss of memory of his mother's face. As his father coaxes him to choose a book that will carry ineffable meaning and irresistible appeal for him from the seemingly boundless, spiraling labyrinth of shelves, Daniel picks Julian Carax's THE SHADOW OF THE WIND, which intrigues him. The novel, its character, which later on brings out of the pages and chases after him, and its mysterious author, at once fascinates him. He refuses to sell the book at any price, guards it as his most precious possession and adopts it for life.<br /><br />To Daniel's shock, a strange person who later reveals to him to be a man deprived of any facial feature, has been systematically and assiduously destroying every single copy of every book Julian Carax had written. Collectors either sell off or surrender altogether their remaining copies to the man for fear of deadly mishap despite the high values of the books. It intrigues Daniel even more as he realizes he may possess the very last copy of Carax's books in existence.<br /><br />Daniel, with the complicity of the witty Furmin, an ex-spy, ventures to unravel the mystery of Julian Carax only to realize all his findings, leads, second-hand rumors, third-hand stories, vague memories, and opinions are nothing but scrapes of an iceberg: they only add to Carax's enigma. Barcelona is the city in which Carax was born and from which he disappeared without a trace at the start of the war.<br /><br />Further investigation leads Daniel to Penelope Aldaya who sits at the center of the whole mystery, with whom she was enmeshed in a heart-piercing romance relationship. Their love is an act of defiance, arrogance, and subversion: love that is a blind desire to be discovered, a secret that hopes to be laid open, a love that devours them. What he starts off as an innocent quest to rescue Carax from recesses of the past becomes a connecting-the-dot reconstruction of a heart-rending love tragedy with sharp nuances of those who were involved. It also offers a peek of the city's past that was forgotten and ruined after the war.<br /><br />Carax's unswerving desire to lead a private life as if he is no longer interested in the world makes the deepest impression on Daniel. His book conveys a unique message to Daniel and impregnates his resolve to discover his life. For every book has a soul: the soul of the person who writes it and that of the one who reads, lives, and dreams with it. Daniel relates to Carax's battered love life as his relationship with Beatriz is under fire. Carax's checkered fate might have awakened a strange but tender sympathy in Daniel, which prompts him to carry on the probe.<br /><br />THE SHADOW OF THE WIND is an uncannily absorbing mystery, a heart-piercing love story, and a literary historical fiction. It pays homage to the mystical power of a book when it finds the reader to whom it appeals and in whom awakes a tender affection and sense of relatability. The novel spins off to numerous leads from the beginning and, with cunning decoys and twists, throws one to dead ends and false tracks which reader often takes to be the truth. The imminent sense of reaching the bottom of the truth often adds to the enigma. The bright side of this punctilious craft of convolution is a tight-knitted plot, spans over intervals of time and memory, riddled of a haunting suspense. One would find the figure of Julian Carax increasingly intriguing as everything related to him seems to be shrouded in mystery. Each of the people involved in this mystery is poisoned by the troubled memory of what he/she feels has been snatched from him/her. The novel is therefore, in a paradoxical way, a homage to the kind of true love that is capable of wrecking what stupendous a damage that Julian Carax has suffered.niel, which prompts him to carry on the probe.<br /><br />THE SHADOW OF THE WIND is an uncannily absorbing mystery, a heart-piercing love story, and a literary historical fiction.

B000002U9Y|3.0|Often reduced to a historical curiosity in the Pink Floyd story, this album is perhaps the most radically different of any they ever produced, save perhaps Ummagumma in 69.  Most reviewers have made it clear how this is the transitional album which handed the wheel from Barrett to Roger Waters.  This is true, fans of Piper will undoubtably find a much darker and more layered portrait, devoid of almost any whimsy or wit.  Three of the songs were left off of Piper for various reasons, only to languish for a year and be released on this lp.  These songs are Wright's Remember a Day, Water's Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun, and Barrett's Jugband Blues.  While Barrett only penned one of the album tracks, his guitar playing can be heard on the three beforementioned tracks in between Dave Gilmours later overdubs.  Perhaps it is no coincidence that these three tracks are my personal favorites from this lp.  With the exception of Let There be More Light, I think the rest of tracks are somewhat lacking, including the title track which would blossum into a masterpiece in later concerts.  With three different songwriters, and the inclusion of David Gilmour on guitar, this album is as kaleidescopic as the cover art, but I think that is what makes it such a complelling listen, especially in the shadow of what came before and after its release.

1400032717|5.0|Christopher Boone is fifteen years and three months and two days old when he discovers Wellington, a neighbor's poodle, stabbed through the heart with a pitchfork. Christopher, an ardent admirer of Sherlock Holmes, sets out to solve the mystery.<br /><br />Against his father's wishes, Christopher puts together a logical plan for finding Wellington's murderer.  He creates a map of his neighborhood and interviews suspects.  In the process, the reader pieces together what happened to the dog.<br /><br />Although Christopher is a mathematical savant, he cannot interpret even simple actions of the humans in his life.  Every word, every gesture, is understood only in its most literal meaning.  Christopher is autistic.<br /><br />His particular form of autism means he absorbs every piece of information but is unable to sort through to determine what is important and what can be discarded.  Therein lies the book's genius-and irony. On the surface, the premise is simple: it's a murder mystery, but the detective-who captures every detail-also misses the larger meaning. Or does he? Perhaps the qualities that set him apart from society are those that we discover to be his greatest gifts.<br /><br />The book sags a little in the middle and could have been improved with a shade more tension as Christopher leaves his safety zone.  But that's a minor flaw. What is most impressive is the author's ability to capture the world of autism with such charm and energy that readers feel the courage of this boy, alone in his frightening world.<br /><br />Although told from the point of view of an autistic boy, it's more than a book about disability.  Instead it's a story of hope and triumph.  It has a message for all of us.  In the end, we all must choose whether or not to face our own fears.
B0002X314C|4.0|Remember when Alicia Keys first came out and a lot of haters said that she really couldn't sing, and that she was just this poor little Clive Davis puppet?  Years later she proved that she belongs, and I think that John Legend will do the same. <br />     They said Keys was overated.  No!  She was not overated, but she was over-hyped. There is a difference. We got tired of seeing her on the cover of every mag and hearing how good she was.  Once Mr. Stephens gets out on tour and away from the shadow of Mr. West he'll prove that he is more substance than hype as well. <br />     He's not the female Alicia Keys, he's more like the male Mary J. Blige.  And you know what I mean by that, his voice IS NOT pitch perfect; but damn if he doesn't put enough emotion in his sung lyrics to take your mind back to the same situation he's singing about.  He's the truth. <br />     True R&B is pretty miserable right now.  This album is not just another I love you, I need you, I want you R&B record.  In time and with polish he'll be among the elite as Maxwell and Brian Mcknight are now.
B00078XGRO|5.0|Really, I have just enjoyed reading all the reviews for First Contact.  Trek fans (I've always felt) tend to be literate and thoughtful people who can express themselves without alphabetical shortcuts or the word 'sucked'.  It's been fun to read the thoughts ... and of course 'First Contact' is the great outing for the Next Generation crew.  This movie is almost Shakespearian in its depth and grandiosity, covering just about every emotion from rage to \\"you have the bridge, Number One.\\"  Patrick Stewart, in particular, turns in a performance that would honor any movie in any genre.  The man can so some acting.  'First Contact' ranks among the best in space opera and this two-disc release does it justice.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|A friend of mine, BP, once told me that Van Halen was the Led Zep of our generation.  What he meant was that the generation before us could claim Zep as their band because Plant & Co. created their best material and played to massive crowds during \\"those\\" guys teen years.  What a thrill that must have been.  Well, we had an \\"Eruption\\" during our glorious teen years known as Van Halen.  Diamond Dave, Famous Eddie, and their fist pounding rhythm section set the standard for hard rock in the late 70's and early 80's.  Others may disagree, but as someone who owns all the Roth VH records and saw the band live, I say that this CD is the best they did.  It introduced the world to a brand new way of playing guitar and put a voice behind the mike that came on like a raging lion.  Before music became so processed, there were actually bands like VH that honed their chops playing massive backyard shows under the California sun;then they carried this raucous attitude into the studio and created unforgettable tunes like, \\"Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love,\\" and \\"Ice Cream Man.\\" The wonderful thing about this CD is the hard rockin' sound that doesn't let up; even when the boys slow it down for humorous effect on \\"Ice Cream Man,\\" they rip it up before the song concludes.  I still remember awaiting each new VH album to check out the latest wild man vocals of Diamond Dave and the trapeeze artist guitar antics of Eddie.  But it all started with the FIRST ONE, Van Halen I.  Check it out, Dudes & Babes; you won't be disappointed.  Based on this album alone, the boys in the band ought to be in the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame.

0060234814|5.0|The earliest memories I have is my father reading me this book before I wnet to sleep and I would drem about it. Thsi book is hands down the best book I have ever read. Read this book to your children and they will love it. The book is like Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan. it is the story of  Four normal children and how they enter a world through a wardrobe in an old house and come to rescue that world. It is a very symbolic book but i never picked up on that until I was at least in my teens. It is defintley not preachy and is a very simple engaging fairytale. i love this book more than any other and Every child should read it.
B000062YB1|4.0|I can't possibly consider Seasons the best Slayer album in light of Reign in Blood and Hell Awaits, but I feel that it improves on what South of Heaven began. The speed is still present in \\"War Ensemble\\" and \\"Hallowed Point\\", and yet the slow/heavy returns in \\"Skeletons of Society\\" and the epic title track, which is often underrated. I like the lead work on this album more than on almost every other Slayer album and the lyrics are particularly eerie. \\"Dead Skin Mask\\" is undeniably addicting in that regards, while \\"Temptation\\" mixes all of Slayer's best elements. If you like any one of their cds, you will like this one. Even the vocals seem to have improved in quality, while the production stays consistant. Again, fans of the genre will not be dissappointed, even if South of Heaven didn't cut it for them.

B00005JNQQ|4.0|Robots was a movie that I was totally interested in seeing.  I am older but I am a fan of the cartoon movies.  I went with my best friend and aunt and we had a good time.  It was a cute and funny movie.  I will admit I laughed when I think I was suppose to, but, even though it was cute it was lacking something.   I am not sure what is going on with the people who make the cartoon movies but I just left with an okay feeling.  Nothing spectacular to give it 5 stars.  I will also admit I laughed in some parts just because I knew I was suppose to laugh and not actually because it was funny.  I think it is cute for little kids but it has a lot of adult humor that you will have to watch for mixed into the movie.  I personally liked the part where Paul Gimani's character wouldn't let Mcgregor's character into Big Weild's city.  It was funny and I like Mel Brooks character he was cute to actually I liked all the characters but I really was missing some oomph when I left it.  If you have kids or are just a big kid at heart I would suggest you check out this movie...maybe you can find out what is missing for me :).
B000094HLA|2.0|And it is difficult to enjoy this version of the Goldberg Variations for that reason.  Instead of bringing out the lines, Schiff washes them together with the pedal in ungainly harmonic blocks.  The microphone is too far away from the piano so this just adds to the misery.
1400032717|5.0|Wow, Wow, Wow is all I can say about this book.  I decided to read it when I saw it was popular on amazon; and this book should be popular, it is amazing!  I was taken into Christopher's life as if I was actually living it along with him!  It was brilliant writing and was very accurate.  Each step I took with Christopher was one that made me think and analyze the way life is.  It was a book that I have been talking highly of to everyone I know.  It is an amazing read and one that I feel everyone should attempt because I know once you get into the first few pages you will be hooked and won't be able to put the book down until you are done!  If you like books that are well written and have a plot and story this book is for you it has the whole package one would want in a book!
B0007YEKZU|4.0|This is a comedic Kung Fu movie with some flying / air fighting elements in it, as well as comic book style fighting. There is also what appears to be CG special effects. <br /> <br />Although I don't usually like movies with flying style moves (save The Iron Monkey), this movie is actually a decent mix of choreographed ground moves, air moves, and comic book style moves. They did a very good job in blending the moves together seemlessly. <br /> <br />As far as the plot goes, it is fairly well done. You don't really know for sure what's going on at first, although there are plent of hints, but eventually about half way through the plot you'll figure out what's going to happen at the end. As I stated earlier, this is a comedy, and the jokes are pretty funny, at least to my immature self. <br /> <br />End note: I viewed the chinese DVD of this movie -> only cantonese and manderin audio with english subtitles. I'm guessing the english version differs only in the audio track.

Wishmaster was so good that I just had to purchase another nightwish cd, but sadly I chose the wrong one to buy. This album wasn't nearly as good as wishmaster and I only  liked about three songs on the entire cd. But track #9 is a reason to buy the cd, this song is so awesome, I've listened to it like 30 times in a row. If all the songs on this album were as amazing as this song then it would be an ok cd.

0375805613|5.0|You will never find a better book to read aloud to your toddler.  <br /> <br />The Monster at the End of This Book is an interactive adventure with Grover, who knows that something is wrong as soon as he sees the title on the cover page. \\"What did that say?\\" he asks. \\"On the first page, what did that say? Did that say there will be a MONSTER at the end of this book??? It did? Oh, I am so scared of Monsters!!!\\" <br /> <br />As the book progresses, Grover does everything he can to prevent you from turning the page, from tying the pages down with ropes to begging. Your child will love the feeling of empowerment as he or she steamrolls Grover's objections time and time again.  <br /> <br />In the end, of course, it turns out that Grover has forgotten that he, himself is a monster, and so has nothing to fear.  <br /> <br />I've read hundreds and hundreds of picture books for children, and nothing has beaten this magical formula for laughter and interaction. You must read this book to your child.  <br />
B0002MPU1K|2.0|I really liked Peter Cincotti's first cd, and was looking for more of those clean, almost sparse, little-trio-in-a-smoky-bar arrangements.  I found this to be over-orchestrated and overproduced.  No smoke, no sizzle.
0451450523|5.0|Not too many writers try to take on the task of bringing a fairy tale to life in a novel. Of those who do try, very few succeed.     Peter Beagle is one of the few who have succeeded.     The Last Unicorn successfully preserves the magic of a fairy tale over the course of about 250 pages, which is immensely difficult. The lyrical language and the unforgettable characters, who are both romantic and realistic, strike a chord that have made this book one of those converting accounts that each reader urges a friend to read.     The basic story is about a unicorn who lives in a wood with only a very vague sense of time, or the world beyond. When she becomes aware that she may be the last unicorn left in the world, she must venture forth from her safe haven and try to find out what has happened to her kind. On the way to an exciting climax with the mythic and forbidding Red Bull, she encounters danger in the form of harpies and witches. She also meets friends, most notably Schmendrick the sometimes-hapless magician, and the good-hearted Molly Grue, who has seen too much of the world.     I really liked the cartoon when it was first released, and would recommend it to anyone who has read the book. However, it hasn't aged particularly well, and shouldn't be viewed by anyone who hasn't read the book first.     Don't confuse this book with other \\"fantasy novels\\" that have become a formulaic genre of often-bad writing. This novel is a notch higher than other novels in the genre; indeed, it is one of the reasons that the genre began.
0553802534|1.0|I have enjoyed Lisa Garnder's other books, and was very much looking forward to this one...to my great disappointment.  Aside from the overwrought and completely unrealistic plot, I found none of the characters likeable.  It was an exercise in self-torture to actually finish this book.
B000065U1N|3.0|This film had great potential, it even was supported by an all star cast, Josh Hartnett, Jason Isaacs, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, etc... The crew was also exceptional, Ridely Scott, Hans Zimmer... <br /> <br />My impression after watching the film, weak in it's character development, to heavy on the WAR part of it. <br /> <br />I highly recomend, Saving Private Ryan, and We Were Soldiers.
B00000331V|5.0|\\"Blow Your Face Out\\" is in a league with only a handful of other live albums.  Alongside The Allman Brothers' \\"At the Filmore East\\" and Cheap Trick's \\"At Budokan\\".  All three of the records \\"Get it.\\" Not a bad track in the bunch.  Every song on \\"BYFO\\" is better than its original studio version. <br />Recorded in Boston and Detroit back in 1975, J. Geils was on, and I mean on.  From the intro to Musta Got Lost to the pumped up version of Lookin' For A Love.  Geils was having a ball on stage and it comes through loud and clear on this recording.  Highly recomended! <br />
B0001BKAEY|3.0|First off, don't put this DVD in expecting The Matrix, or anything equal to \\"Reloaded.\\" It is a little bland compared with it's prequels. It is much more violent, sad, and dark.     The fight scene at the end is pretty neat, but it really failed to pack in the physcilogical blast the first two had in great measure.     See it, but don't expect the first two. Maybe you should rent it edited, it had some content problems as well.
B00005OWEG|4.0|A dark film that grows darker as it moves deeper into the jungles in Vietnam, as Martin Sheen's Captain Willard runs a covert operation to assassinate a renegade Green Beret, played by Marlon Brando. The insanity of war and its cast of characters are well illustrated, and the characters here also descend quickly into the mire of war and of questionable activity. Willard researches Brando's mysterious character, Colonel Kurtz, who has disobeyed orders and set up his own \\"kingdom\\" in the jungle; Willard finds himself understanding a little too well what it is that has driven Kurtz over the edge. Frankly I find it difficult to describe to do the film justice or just to provide the basics of the film. The performances here are outstanding, if shocking at times, and the film gives a (once again) very dark glimpse into grim, ugly and gory realities of war and the descent into madness that often accompanies the realization that the war one is fighting for isn't just or just isn't making sense.
B00003CX5P|5.0|This film is not as horrible as so many people are saying. It is actually very good. I enjoyed it as much as any of the old films. Keep an open mind.
B0001ADAVK|3.0|I was prepared before seeing this to dismiss it as drivel, and in some sense it was. Although Julia Roberts was not terrible in this role by any means, I found her to be... not entirely believable in her role as a professor. Still, the kind of professor she was supposed to be and her ability to ruffle feathers and shake things up (being a more free-spirited California girl as opposed to the stuffy upper crust girls she teaches at Wellesley), that was more believable. Roberts has the kind of fired-up passion to inspire her students. More important though were the supporting cast of characters, her students, who fall into some stereotypical roles but who do so believably within the framework of the era (1950s); though being educated, they were being groomed for marriage and family life. Roberts comes along and tries to make each of them see that this was not the only option available to them. Julia Stiles and Maggie Gyllenhaal were particularly believable; Kirsten Dunst is particularly good as an insecure, spoiled witch debutante who revels in schadenfreude. I can buy that. Although there were some good moments here, and the film was fine enough, it was too much a female version of Dead Poet's Society and therefore isn't treading new artistic territory.
B00003CXTG|4.0|First of all, this film is VERY sad. It is almost deppressing. Good news. This film has some humor, and a triumphant ending. <br /> <br />I will not disclose this film's story in my review. You need to see it for yourself.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|Billy Crudup plays Will Bloom, estranged from his family and living in France when he is summoned urgently to his father's side. His relationship with his ailing father has long suffered from his father's love of absurd tall tales, which Will has interpreted to be a wall or form of distance between his father and him. He feels he has never known the real Ed Bloom. He agrees to come to his dying father's bedside in a bid to find out once and for all who his father was. Contentious relations aside, Will returns to hear the larger than life fish tales once more. The sadness of the story is bittersweet-otherworldly flashbacks brought to fantastical life by Tim Burton's unparalleled creative eye and the wide, bright, inviting smile of the ever engaging Ewan McGregor as a young Ed Bloom. Albert Finney's narration takes on new life when personified as such. Will's skepticism is eventually quelled as he realizes that these stories are who his father is, and when he finds out that there is some truth behind the hyperbole. He learns finally to love and respect his father, whatever his quirks. At once both whimsical and moving.

B00005JMFQ|3.0|Many interesting stories, mostly fluffy but heartwarming tales, blend together in a loosely interwoven tale. The cast is impressive both in number of people in the film and in the quality of actors (Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, just to name a few) and the film is a mad dash sort of romantic comedy careening toward the Christmas climax. The story follows possibly eight couples who are trying to get together, falling in love, just discovering their true feelings, making their true feelings known, giving in to their feelings or saying \\"to heck with convention\\", and going above and beyond the call of duty for love. It touches in a shallow, but not wholly unsatisfying, way the various trials and triumphs of different types of love and does so in an entertaining way. The fact that the characters here could be as well developed as they are (given their sheer numbers) is remarkable and laudatory. Still there is something a bit saccharine about the whole thing, but the viewer will probably forgive because the director is new at directing, because it is a sort of heartwarming and cute story, and because the performances are all good. Besides, it was a Christmastime release and everyone wants a happy ending.
B000286S8S|4.0|Van Halen's \\"Best of Both Worlds\\" just misses the mark at being a definitive anthology.<br /><br />You can't argue with the music on this collection--all terrific songs that span the band's 25+ year career. These are all terrific hard-rock classics that generations of fans know and love. These are songs that bring back terrific memories and are part of our lives. All of the band's big hits are here, so the casual VH fan will get a fix of all the classic songs from both the Roth and the Hagar era. However, the tracklist and booklet are imperfect, so this collection looses a few points.<br /><br />This collection has received criticism for the sequencing of songs. For the most part, the Roth and Hagar songs are sequenced, so that each era is represented by every other song. It has been argued that it would have been much better to have one disc of all Roth-era material, and then a second disc for of all Hagar era material. For a new fan this would have been preferable. I, however, am happy that the band opted for a Roth/Hagar sequencing. For someone very familiar with these songs, it mixes things up and keeps things interesting.<br /><br />There are, however, things I do not like about the tracklist. It was a total waste to include Three live versions of Hagar singing Roth era tunes. These live songs \\"Ain't Talkin' Bout Love,\\" \\"Jump\\" and \\"Panama\\" sound good, but it just takes up space. There are a lot of cool VH tunes that were left off and could have been included in place of these live cuts, like--\\"Little Guitars,\\" \\"Secrets\\" \\"In a Simple Rhyme\\" and \\"Take Me Back (D&eacute;j&agrave; vu).\\"<br /><br />The booklet is also a slam to Roth, the classic VH legacy, and it's fans. The booklet tells the story of VH and almost completely ignores Roth, mentioning him only when he first joined and left the band. There are no pictures of him, except the ones where he is featured on past VH album covers. This, along with the inclusion of Hagar singing Roth songs is VH trying to rewrite it's history and try to make the Van Hagar era out to be the definitive version of VH. It's as though the band were trying to erase Roth's impact and importance to the band's history. This is disgraceful and disrespectful on the part of the Van Halen brothers.<br /><br />The new songs \\"It's about Time\\" \\"Up for Breakfast\\" and \\"Leaning to See\\" are good, but not great. They sound like warmed-over songs from \\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\\" or \\"Balance.\\" They're not anywhere near as good as \\"Can't Get this Stuff No More,\\" and \\"Me Wise Magic\\" the new songs recorded for the first VH best of collection.<br /><br />And then there is the matter of Gary Cherone. Yes, most fans hated \\"Van Halen 3\\" and are probably glad the band opted not to include any songs from that era. But it was still very uncool of the band not to even mention Cherone's name in the liner notes, or list \\"Van Halen 3\\" in its discography. It's as though the band were trying to erase that album and lineup from it's history. I would have liked to of heard VH3's \\"From Afar\\" on this collection--a very cool song--certainly far better and more interesting than the new Hagar recordings.<br /><br />Despite it's faults, it's a great introduction to the band's music, and overall, a good anthology.Hagar era out to be the definitive version of VH.

B00002E224|2.0|A lot of hype surrounded this film, lauding its romance and warmth and the authenticity of its characters. Maybe I am jaded or maybe I just don't like Hawke or Delpy or see any realism here. I found nothing here authentic except Hawke's character's rather condescending \\"I'm an American; I rule\\" attitude. His character is young, nave and inexperienced in the world but still takes it on as if he were a cool intellectual. The conversations between Delpy and him hit home his lack of depth and total lack of experience and world view. He embodies in many ways most of the traits that makes Americans appear so ugly abroad. The love story that develops between these two characters is also artificial and irksome. Perhaps I just don't understand romance as it flowers, but the lack of chemistry between these two actors, the way in which Hawke's character dismissed most of the things that seemed most important to Delpy's character... how could a bond form? Sure, opposites attract, especially if they are looking just to have \\"one night together\\" in some faux romantic setting. No sense idealizing this sort of drivel.
B00005JLFC|5.0|One of my all-time favorite movies. Let's have it on DVD, so we can finally own all the wonderful extras Barbra will make sure are included on such a beautiful masterpiece. The last scene alone is worth the price of the DVD. I'm a rocker through and through, but I make one exception: Barbra...her voice is like no other. Release the DVD so we can watch it again and again. I'm Jewish, but you don't have to be to appreciate such a glorious movie.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I feel sorry for the dopes who cry that Lucas edited to much. I myself am a huge Star Wars fan and I'm not really mad at Lucas as most. Only thing I think shouldn't have been added is CG characters. It really doesn't fit in with the aged real time cameras and what not. Other than that I don't care that Lucas changed Han Solo's scene where he doesn't shoot first. I can't believe people are actually crying over a little scene that was changed and had no major impact in the story at all.
B0006399FS|2.0|U2 was, at one time, a force to be reckoned with. They had a sound and a message as well as the ideal that music could change things. On their last two outings, they have borrowed heavily from others as well as themselves. That's ok if you can do something new with it but these guys simply don't anymore. This is more a fulfillment to a contractual obligation than it is music. It's well crafted but ultimately empty and boring. Bono should stop trying to sing and go fulltime into his charitable pursuits.
B00005JLXE|3.0|The movie stars Gigli as the masked crusader Daredevil. A lone vigilante that believes in 'the greater good'. He fights Alexander in his best performance ever as Bullseye. Rent this nice action movie but not worth buying because it gets old quickly.
B0006B29WA|5.0|What more can be said about this band than to look at their meteoric rise from obscurity in just one year. This album (along with the bonus CD) are only a hint of things to come. They are truly talented musicians and have incredible presence onstage (I've seen them in Atlanta and Chicago). Yes, their music is very retro but they make it seamlessly their own. It is melodic, danceable, joyful, humorous, intelligent, and literate without pomp or circumstance. Franz Ferdinand, both the band and the album, are incredible.
0790729628|2.0|I believe the original theatrical release was far better than the director's cut which was a bore and the Unicorn scene not only made no sense it did not fit into the film. The original film monologue kept the film moving and was a brilliant vehicle for telling the story. As for the ending of the original, the final words gave the audiance something to ponder vs. the Director's cut which left the audiance wondering, wondering what happened to the film \\"Blade Runner\\"! The original theatrical release of \\"Blade Runner\\" is one of the best all time Sci-Fi's ever and remains so today.
015204907X|5.0|I teach English in Japan and am often asked to make visits to elementary schools.  This book is great for filling in extra time on those visits.  The vocabulary is simple, and the use of opposites is wonderful.  My students have a very low English level, yet can follow the plot of this book very easily.  They also enjoy chiming in to ask \\"Where is the green sheep?\\" (Midori hitsugi, doko desu ka)  Although they may retain very little of the vocabulary, they have a great sense of pride after having read and understood an English book.
B00005JN2Z|3.0|OK. so we've got a crime drama with some easy cliches: assasin with preternatural skills, ordinary guy (cabbie) with dreams of a better life; a brief meeting with casual love interest that turns out to be a key element to the plot and lastly of course a shortening list of victims that provides the engine for everything else. <br />Usually, when you watch a 'Firstname Lastname' film the whole point is the branding and the quality of the film is inversely proportional to the amount of desperate product placement and insecure-film-director ego identification. The need of one person to grab the credit for the work of several hundred talented individuals renders the whole thing worthless. <br />After a build-up like that you might be expecting the 'Collateral' falls into one of two extremes: awesome or pitiful. More interestingly, it's neither. For those of you that enjoy the 'Michael Mann' flavour, this is an opportunity to experience it in a new mix. No, it's not 'Miami Vice' with 20 years of additional designer stubble. Nor is it 'Heat' re-visited - although that would not necessarily have been a bad thing. One of the hallmarks of previous Mann productions is the creation of atmosphere using well matched musical accompaniment. The MTV generation  in particular will remember how Miami Vice epitomised the fashion for a storyline crafted seemingly specifically to match the mood music - almost as though the program was an extended rock video. Style over substance, the critics said, as though that was something bad and shameful. It was the 80's - need more be said? <br />So how does this all relate to 'Collateral'? Well, something happened with the editing and particularly them music production. No honey-smooth music; it's jarring, disjointed and - most significantly - noticeable. If you've noticed no mention of the trivial stuff such as visuals & cinematography or the acting ... something happened there too and it was much more interesting. It's refreshing seeing Tom Cruise step outside the pretty-nice-boy stereotype and if he'd been given more to work with he could have added some serious depth and grit to story.   <br /> <br />Despite the soundtrack let-down; despite the 2-dimensional storyline, all is not lost. This is worthwhile entertainment that will grab you in the mood and take you with it. It's not going to set you ablaze so set your expectations appropriately and you'll enjoy it.The pace is unusual; uneven with a slow-fast-slow approach that creates a 'when will the punch land?' feeling. The violence is causal, matter of fact and by no means purely physical, which supports the overall atmosphere nicely. Whatever else you might fault with the production the visual treatment is terrific. There's a bleak, almost monochromatic edge to the colouration and a washed-out look that - once again - supports the atmosphere. Nihilism should be effortless to be convincing and 'Collateral' takes the less is more approach to good effect. There's enough blam-blam-crash-boom-bang to keep the action folks interested but 'Collateral' provides more than a succession of set pieces choreographed around then next explosion. The morality is ambiguous (thank goodness) and while there's some sense that a message should be taken from it all it's not rammed down your throat or telegraphed with endless 'major-plot-point; major-plot-point' signposts in the written-for-morons style. <br /> <br />For: <br />- stark, nihilistic, ambiguous and visually delicious. <br /> <br />Against: <br />- intrusive soundtrack and some crashingly illogical elements to the plot that - had they been left out - would have improved the overall effect of the movie tremendously. <br /> <br />The Near Miss: <br />- Can someone give Mr. Cruise a role where the character has some SERIOUS depth? Given how well he did with what he had here there's every indication he could join the ranks of the unforgettable nasties. Bring it on. <br /> <br />Recommended dining:  <br />The Gaumontproduction 'La Femme Nikita' by Luc Besson provides a better example of mood and atmosphere or the so-called style over substance genre but with a surprising amount of substance and some pathos thrown in for good measure.
078681859X|4.0|When looking for books to read, I almost always read the blurb. Reading this blurb made me suspicious - a novel by an English-sounding chap, involving a young boy wizard, set in England, magic and spells - sounds familiar? The thing that caught my eye was a few review lines that described, instead of the boy, the Djinni Bartimaeus - who features as one of the story's principal characters. I was intrigued enough to pick it up. And I am happy to say that I was delighted! An original story that kept me turning pages and before I knew it, I was done and went hunting for book two immediately (which was also brilliant). Suffice it to say that Bartimaeus is an ancient, wizened cynic of a Djinni that will have you howling at his rather unique viewpoint on humanity and human antics. The story is fast-paced with interesting action, rich characters and a very original take on the mechanics of magic, and the nature of wizards. The characters and storyline of the novel are, interestingly enough, quite dark and do not exactly celebrate the generosity of the human spirit - this touch of realism made me like the novel even more. The characters are however no more dark than that of George Lucas' Star Wars epics or J.K.Rowling's Harry Potter books. I did pick this up in the Young Adult section of the bookstore (a section I often un-blushingly browse and regularly buy from) but whether this is really Young Adult material or Adult material is debatable. A must-read for anyone with a sense of humour and imagination.
B000002J0B|5.0|The depth of this album always astounds me.  Jimmy Page's production really shines on this one.  Each song is like its own entity, with a soundscape that is completely unique.  Especially \\"The Rain Song\\".  Listening to that song is like going on a journey.  All of the cuts on this album are classic.  You get the best of both worlds.  The harder Zep that everyone loves, but also the mellowness of songs like \\"No Quarter\\".  And who can forget \\"D'yer Maker\\".  The fact that they pulled that off is amazing in itself.  In my opinion, Led Zeppelin peaked with this album.  \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" is a great way to make that statement.  It just ushers in what you know will be the best album they ever made.  Don't get me wrong, ZOSO was great, and so was II.  But ladies and gentlemen, this one surpasses them all.
B00070DK5K|5.0|I never was that big of a Bowie fan. The 70s for me were ruled by the beast that is Led Zeppelin. But anyway, a Bowiehead (i doubt that's we they called themselves, but that's all i got) friend of mine put me on to this live recording as a Bowie starter kit. I was expecting Disc One to be the one that grabbed me, with his better-known songs \\"Rebel Rebel,\\" \\"Changes\\" and \\"Suffragette City\\" (which were all great live, don't get me wrong), but Disc Two is what makes the (double) album.  This is going to sound like a lame movie review from the local NBC affiliate in Des Moines, but I swear that Disc Two grabs you and doesn't let go.  To hear his band expand and improvise their way through the best of Bowie's first 6-7 albums with wild piano florishes and saxophone wails is an amazing experience; musta been cool to catch him live in person at this point in his career.  Not sure what the original sounded like, but the sound on this new version is crisp and clean. Bonus points for the cool packaging.
6305252521|5.0|i saw this movie a couple days ago and the story is soo good...imagine you are being watched by people world wide and you don't know the world your living in is a big giant set made especially for you. well in the movie jim carrey starts realize this little by little and he tries to escape this fake world but there are many things that try to stop him to make him think his world is real.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Without a doubt, Frances The Mute is the best album of the year.  Even with new releases from Queens Of The Stone Age, System Of A Down and many other good possibilities, Frances trumps them all.  The album tells the story perfectly with different styles of music and Cedric singing with different types of vocals to represent different characters.  With the connection of the Sarcophagi movements, the flow of the album is done well.  Cygnus and Cassandra are incredibly awesome hard songs.  L'Via is a great Latin influenced song that has the best groove on the album.  Miranda gave me chills the first time I heard it and the horns kicked in.  The Widow seems a bit out of place on this album, but that's probably due to it staying only shortly.  My only complaints are some of the song transitions are a little long and the album should have been a double album to include the true first song, the title track.
B00008EY9G|5.0|This was a top rate thriller. The murders, the dark, almost gothic atmosphere, the guesses as to whom the killer was and then watching those guesses disappear when your suspect was murdered - superbly done. <br /> <br />The acting was first rate, especially Cusack. So was the cinematography. You could feel the pelting rain in the film falling on your own shoulders. <br /> <br />There was - what seemed - to be a subplot to the film. There was the issue of a stay of execution for a serial murderer that seemed to be unrelated to the film. I'm embarrassed to say that instead of realizing that this was an integral part of what was happening at the motel, I put it into the back of my mind. So to future viewers of this: pay close attention. <br /> <br />Moreover, if I had been more aptly observant in the beginning of the film (although to be fair, I'm hard of hearing and the closed captioning wasn't working, so I had a difficult time catching the dialogue), it would have been easier to tie the subplot to what seemed to be the main plot - the executions. <br /> <br />Then the ingenuity of the film kicked in. We saw that what was at stake was the multiple personality disorder of the serial killer - and this too we should have seen. I imagine (hope?) I wasn't the only one who didn't tie together the beginning, the stay of execution, and the commonalities shared with the victims at the motel. I was mesmerized as the truth began to unfold, although to be honest I would have liked a little more unraveling at the hands of the filmmakers. In my opinion, there should have been more work between the psychologist and the patient. There were a number of ways that could have been achieved without giving anything away, but I can understand why the filmmakers decided not to address it. Still, when we were let onto the BIG SECRET, it would have been nice to have been walked through it, simply because there are a lot of people who simply didn't get the ending at all. <br /> <br />I can understand how it could be easy for someone watching the film not to understand the final scene. In fact, I didn't figure it out until this very moment. In order to get a stay of execution, the serial killer needed to dispel all of his murderous or disturbed identities. The people who were involved in the meeting where his stay of execution was being debated believed that he had. <br /> <br />Don't think in linear terms when you reach the end, because if you do the ending will seem trite and contrived when in fact it is brilliant. Instead, think of the need to exorcise all of the negative personalities, and pay no attention whatsoever to the actual events at the motel. Those events may - or may not (hehe) - be a fantasy, or a re-creation to perform said exorcism. <br />
B0007O38F8|4.0|Listen 50 is hot he has his own style and it's catchy an good for Hip-Hop.

Amazin featuring Olivia is impressive and most of all /PIGGY BANK/ Were he dissis' Jadakiss, Shine and Fat Joe its hot so go an cop dat not quite better than THE DOCUMENTARY! cAsPeR
B000002MFQ|4.0|This is clearly a \\"Marmite\\" album (you either love or hate it with a passion). Personally, I love it; in fact I find that I listen to it far more than the original. That may be because I first heard it played live at the Edinburgh Festival (only on TV I'm afraid) and it was truly memorable (despite the puerile antics of John Gordon Sinclair, who mimed the announcer part). <br /> <br />Following the TB1 format so slavishly made it inevitable that listeners would compare the individual elements from the two versions. Most compare well with the original (particularly Tattoo, which I find quite moving even thought I normally can't stand the sound of bagpipes). Others don't, particularly Altered States, which IMHO is a bad joke.   <br /> <br />As far as those reviewers, who really hate TB II, are concerned, I wonder what they made of TB 2003. Now that really was the pits without any redeeming features at all.      <br />

B0002CHIJW|4.0|Long story short, this girl goes to get away to some cabin, some hicks run around raping her for like a good 30 minutes of the movie, and the revenge she gets is sweet. Its a cult classic and definitly worth the money.you wont be dissapointed.
B0000028M7|5.0|I've listened to this CD over and over. Favorite track is Them Bones. These guys created the new sound of rock in the early '90s. This is one CD every rock fan should have.
6304711875|2.0|Not a movie I would buy, i didnt know this was actually horror. I thought horror was suppose to be somewhat frightening and this made me laugh cause it was so corny. Then again my taste in horror is different I only really buy horror from the 70's and 80' occasionally some new stuff, very rare though. Any hardcore hoorror fan could tell you dont buy this. If its on TV and there is nothing else on i will watch it.
B0000UJL96|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much, I liked the action, the space battles, the drama, and yes, Sulu should have gotten his own TV series as captain of the Excelsior as a spin off to this film.  (Why that series never took off, and \\"Enterprise\\" did, will always remain a mystery to me) Two things bothered me about the film. First, there should have been more of a send-off for the original cast.  There is a nod towards this at the very end of the movie but it was not enough. Secondly, I'm sorry...but there is no way that an alien race such as the Klingons would know Shakespeare. Yes, I know director Nick Meyer is a Shakespeare fan and was making a reference to WWII germany and that the film is basically a satire of the cold war...but Shakespearean Klingons make about as much sense as Vulcans speaking in Eminem lyrics. Just plain silly.
6305903182|1.0|The movie is stupid alonmg with the first and second movie. I just dont know what would make people buy this crap. You want a real horror movie get, \\"maniac\\" starring Joe Spinnel, \\"texas chainsaw massacre\\" Diirected by Tobe Hooper the one from the 70's not the 2004 garbage remake, or \\" the hills have eyes\\" etc.. i could go on and on but wont. Any real fans of horror movies will know what I mean if they saw any of the movies i listed.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|Over the last decade or so, little has excited the Hollywood establishment more than the 'Thriller', or 'Serial Killer Movie'. (Well not all thrillers involve serial killers, but virtually all the major recent ones do)  I generally don't watch these films.  Sure, 'Silence of the Lambs' was pretty good, and 'Seven' was good too, but most of these films just look tedious and formulaic, and what little I have seen has fulfilled these expectations. Now we have 'Saw', and I'm pleased to say that it isn't really a thriller, and leans more to the horror side of the spectrum.  Sure, there's a serial killer in the movie, and the visual style is massively indebted to Fincher, but at it's heart, 'Saw' is really just a low-budget horror film.(Only about a million dollar budget, shot in 2 1/2 weeks)  These sorts of films can't complete with major productions in terms of acting and production values, so they put all the emphasis on ideas and scenes.(Well, the good ones do, anyway)  So understand this all coming in- the acting isn't going to be up to major production standards, and the plot isn't going to be as developed or plausible.  If you can't get over those two things, you aren't going to enjoy this.  'Saw', however, makes up for it in other ways.  It's got frightful, intriguing ideas and interesting scenes and a strong, expressionistic (if derivative) visual style.  It may not all add up cleanly at the end, but the scenes are good enough that that doesn't really matter.<br /><br />Though I'm sure everyone already knows, the basic setup is this: Adam and Lawrence wake up in an old, abandoned bathroom.  They are each chained to pipes on the opposite sides of the room.  There is a corpse in between them, an apparent suicide victim, who is holding a tape player and a gun.  They soon learn that they are the victims of the Jigsaw killer, who places people in a elaborate games of death, from which they may be able to escape alive.  They will have to suffer, however.  In this case, Jigsaw requires that Lawrence kill Adam by 6:00, or else Jigsaw will kill Lawrence's family.  The rest of the movie is just their attempts to deal with this situation, and some flashbacks to help them figure out just what is going on.(They're more than a little disoriented, initially) This basic setup is more horror than thriller, as the police only play a very minor role, and there is very little investigation into the killer's life or identity.  They are simply common people in a life or death situation, who must escape.  In lots of ways, the basic plot is pretty Giallo-esque.(Italian thriller precursors which involved a crime investigation,but almost invariably placed style, atmosphere and set-pieces ahead of plot or plausibility)  It uses numerous giallo conventions: the protagonists are regular people, every character matters, the killer's motivation is very giallo-esque (can't be completely specific w/o giving too much away) most everything proves to be connected, and the mandatory twist ending is more of a ludicrous sick joke than a grand revelation. (Not to say that I don't like the ending. I like it a lot)  Naturally, this sort of film is even more convoluted and unlikely that you typical thriller, and I suspect it's just a reflection of sloppy writing rather than same grand scheme, but it reveals the general aesthetic of both these types of films: scenes and ideas first, plot second.<br /><br />Visually, the film is a combination of ultra grimy, sleazy settings with a few high-class but cold and dark places as well.  As I said before, it is massively indebted to David Fincher's work, but that's a very good style.  Well worth ripping off.  The intense griminess and stylization of visuals also sets it apart from most thrillers, as it is taken to such a point that the world no longer seems even remotely real. (Though some thrillers are like this. i.e. `Seven',) Sometimes Wan over does it a little, with some fast-motion-spinny-camera stuff that's just sorta silly, but most of the time it works.  There are some very weird visuals that are, once again, quite typical of independent horror and giallos while being foreign to mainstream thrillers.  For example, `Jigsaw' likes to use a disturbing little ventriloquist dummy as his avatar while communicating with his victims.  He can also be quite flamboyantly dressed, with a huge, shimmery red or black cloak and a bizarre mask.  There's really no explanation why he would choose to be like that, he just does, because the filmmakers thought it would be cool or scary.  Though the film is very dark and grisly it isn't extremely gory.  Much of the violence is shown fairly obscurely or not at all, but what happens is conceptually nasty enough that it is plenty effective even without being given a close, detailed view.  What gore there is is generally fairly well done, particularly considering the budget they had.<br /><br />As I keep saying, this film has great scenes, even if they doesn't always make all that much sense.  Most notably, the whole setup is just great, I think.  Convoluted and highly, highly unlikely, but great.  Some specifics:  A particularly effective scene is when we see the ordeal of Jigsaw's one surviving victim, who had to dig a key out a man intestinal track in order to remove a giant metal device from her heard, which is set to rip her jaws apart if she takes too long.  Similarly excellent is the scene where Adam is abducted, as he wanders about his powerless apart, randomly taking pictures to provide a small, brief bit of illumination.  And, the climax, while I cant go into specifics, is really very intense and grisly.  A very effective closing the the film.<br /><br />Despite what anyway may tell you, the acting in this film is perfectly serviceable.  No, it isn't first-rate, and they occasionally blow some lines, but most of the time it's at least passable.  And anyone who really has that big of a problem with the acting doubtless isn't much of a horror fan, so who cares what they think.<br /><br />Yeah, that's it.  Not terribly plausible, but I've never cared about that much anyway.  Virtually everything else works quite well.  Check it out.rta silly, but most of the time it works.

B00005V9HA|4.0|First things first. You can buy this movie in Best Buy or Circuit city for $15 second this movie is defeintly a classic and worth the money.

B00000F0D1|4.0|This movie is excellent no complaints what so ever. the acting is great, the scene is great the plot is great. this movie is suspensful and realistically frightening. Just a wonnderfully made movie worth the buy. The ankle scene is just sick. Buy it you wont regret it.
B0002858YS|1.0|When I first heard these guys on the radio, I got excited.  I got the CD and I thought that it didn't sound that good.  It sounded flat and lifeless.  I could tell right away that it was overcompressed.  Because there aren't any dynamics left in the songs, there isn't any impact.  There isn't any space for the instruments to breathe, and they sound like they are playing in a small box.  There's &quot;too much sound in a small space&quot;.<br />Dissapointed Again,<BR>Chris Hudec
B00000G3I2|1.0|I had heard so much about this movie, all good, that I looked forward to watching it. It was awful. What a waste of 1 3/4 hours! I know a lot of people love it, but it was not my \\"cup of tea.\\"
B0007N1AI6|4.0|As for the music...this is classic Priest. Great to hear Halford back in the group. As for the U.S. cd releases, well, they both were less than satisfactory. Unlike some reviewers, my star rating is for hte music, not the CD issues. Most of you notice that there are two versions of this album available. There is a \\"dueldisc\\" edition and a limited \\"hardcover\\" book edition. The \\"dueldisc\\" version generates more problems. This is a new type of technology that is still in the working process and there is even a warning on the CD case. The disc features the music portion on one side and a the DVD features on the other. Because of this, the CD is thicker than the usual CD. Since it is thicker, the cd has a hard time playing in a lot of CD players. Forget about playing it in your CD deck in your car. Alot of players also scratch up the DVD side when trying to play the music side. I know a lot of people like myself like to make copies of our CD's so we can play 'em in our cars without worry of ruining the original discs. Forget about that as the new copy protection makes this impossible. Overall, the \\"dueldisc\\" edition blows and should be avoided. People wanting to avoid all the hassle of the ultra-garbage dueldisc version are better off buying the limited hardcover book edition. This has the CD and DVD on seperate discs. You are also able to make back-up copies of the CD for your car with this one. The downfalls of this release is that the CD and DVD come in little slipcases inside the 'book'. This means that if you keep removing the discs, you have a chance of damaging them. I even know a few individuals whose discs came pre-scratched because of these slipcases. The hardcover book is also only slightly better than those dreaded digipacks as it can get ruined very easily. Still, even with its downfalls, the limited is by far the way to go. If only they released it in a regular double jewel case instead...
B00005JNPZ|5.0|This film is absoutly wonderful! HITCH is great becuase it is geniually funny. The cast is very entertaing and funny. HITCH succeds because of the chemistry bewteen the leads... whatever I don;t feel like writing so yea, this is a great movie so there!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|As I walked up to the theatre in my small town, I worried. I worried that Joel Schumaker was going to give us an ugly, high-tech flick like Batman and Robin. That the actors would not be able to act and sing at the same time. I also dreaded that this would be turned into a cheesy comedy instead of a gothic melodrama. As I *left* the theatre, I realized this was the best motion picture I had ever seen. Below I will give a few details on the way the film is perfected.   The Phantom is a mysterious, tragic character that feels that he has been removed from humanity and is now a demon, a monster. Gerard Butler brought this intensity to his role in both singing and speaking.His singing is a bass/tenor voice, that expresses his character perfectly, unlike Michael Crawford who went over-the- top with his soprano voice.Crawford does have a smoother voice, but his seduction level is about 0, as seen in his Music of the Night video. Emmy Rossum is the singer I am the most impressed with. She has a pure beauty to her that has been lost with the rise of cosmetics. When she is scared or sad, her tears come from her eyes, not onions.Sarah Brightman was too squeaky in her singing, and unable to understand.Sarah might have more experience, but her acting is extremely mediocre. Minnie Driver really gave a great performance as La Carlatta Guidecelli, who is an overloud opera diva. Though she didn't sing her part, unlike everyone else, she does sing the beautiful song at the end of the film. Many have complained about her being over-the-top, but whoever paid good money to see under the top? Miranda Richardson is a somewhat shadowy character. Since I saw her playing an evil stepmother in another spectacular film(Sleepy Hollow) I have guessed that she is a truly evil character and that the Phantom is a puppet on her strings...but she isn't.   Alexandra Byrne, you are an absolute genius. You know what the character should be feeling at certain parts of the film. When Christine sings\\"Think Of Me\\" you dressed her in a sparkly, white dress. When she is at the cemetery, you gave her a black cloak and dress with red trimmings.The men's costumes also bring out their feelings, even though they're not as complex.And the sheer number of costumes to be made was, by itself, a challenge, though she tackled it!   Tony Pratt's art direction in this film is the best I've seen since Titanic. It isn't all morbid nor all bright. There are mixtures of both sometimes.We are supposed to be in Paris in 1870 but it seems we are in a time that never even existed. The stage, also, has never looked so beautiful.Nudes adorn all of the poles and pillars, and also keep an eye out for the hidden skulls in the architecture! Keep a sharp eye and notice how a lot of them have their eyes covered! The best set had to be the cemetery. It seems to expand endlessly with its humongous statues, graves, masoleums, and trees!   Cinematography...brilliant. The use of color is sometimes very vague, as in the cemetery scene, to show the deadness of the shot and the sorrow of the characters.In the masquerade scene, we are given many shades of color to accompany the wonderful music, and not just in two or three angles, but in twenty, though there is a certain color code so that when the Phantom arrives in his blood-red outfit, it somehow stains the screen!   Joel, you have brought yourself out of the B-movie hole that you fell into back in 1997.You calmed down and made a beautiful, tear-jerking story. The hatred, love, sorrow, and inner beauty that Gaston Leroux published in his book in 1910 are brought out to the farthest reaches. Stick with these kind of films, and you might become like James Cameron, a recognized director, who had been overlooked for many years.   In conclusion, this film is very beautiful. The story is well-written, the music is unforgettable, and the actors are compelling.The sound on the dVD really blows you away, especially if you have a surround sound system. The picture is preserved to its grandiose 2:40 Widescreen ratio.DO NOT GET FULLSCREEN!You miss 66% of the film. The second disc also has very interesting special features! Please see this film, and put the other classics(I have seen many)behind.
B000065PUE|5.0|This is the first Pixies album I ever heard (though certainly not the last!) and it acted on my brain rather the same way I think a bullet to the temple might.  <br /> <br />After hearing \\"Where Is My Mind?\\" on a mixtape from a friend (a song which, incidentally, comes from the album \\"Surfer Rosa\\") I decided that this was a band that I had to know more about. Well, my dad likes a lot of bands from 4AD's early years, and I suppose he'd bought this one on the strength of the label. He didn't like it much, so I took it from him. Trust me, he won't get it back, even if he wanted it.  <br /> <br />If you are not well acquainted with music like this, \\"Doolittle\\" will blow your mind. With its frightening lyrics (\\"Got me a movie/ Ha ha ha ho/ Slicing up eyeballs/ Ha ha ha ho\\" is one example from \\"Debaser\\") rendered even scarier by Black Francis's completely deranged vocals and a powerful musical bed, this album is like a kind of horror story for your ears. And by God, it's a scary one, too!
B00007JVBI|5.0|Chan Marshall manages to write simple, beautiful songs played on a guitar or piano, sometimes accompanied by other instruments, that come off as completely original.  I honestly don't know how she does it.  She has a unique, chalky voice that seems fragile and childlike.  Not a lot of music I've heard has affected me so profoundly on an emotional level.  Unlike her previous albums, every song on here is great and if you're new to her music, this is the one to start out with.
B0007MVXQG|3.0|Alright, we all have been waiting for this for a long time now, and its finally here. I'll be honest, they were just trying to recreate a bunch of their old songs, with a new little twist. And while, Priest is the only band who can recreate \\"Painkiller\\" and make it sound half decent, that's just not what i was looking for. Anyways, the album is still very good and here's the breakdown:    Judas Rising: Best song on the CD. Probably one of my favorite Priest song's ever (at least top 25). THis is probably the most original song they do on the album, it doesn't sound like a rehash. I would get the album for this song alone (5/5).    Dealing with the Devil: Sounds like a \\"Hell Bent..\\"ish rocker. Decent but not great, especially after \\"Judas Rising\\". Definetly worth a listen. (4/5)    Revolution: The first single and a major letdown. The verses are amazing, but the choruses just destroy the song. This really could have been great. (3.5/5)    Worth Fighting For: They slow things down a little here. Its not bad, for a normal metal song, but for Priest, one or two listens and you get bored. (3/5)    Demonizer: Or if you prefer Painkiller Part 2. The second best song on the CD. Priest is the only band who can try and recreate one of their songs and still make it sound good. Not the same power as \\"Painkiller\\", but still really good. (5/5)    Wheels of Fire: I'll be honest, this songs sucks. It's just so boring. I usually listen to it but have trouble getting through the whole thing. It just sounds like the same thing over and over again. (2.5/5)    Angel: The power ballad of the album, which isn't all that bad. The build up in intensity and i really enjoy it, for what it is that is. (4/5)    Hellrider: My third favorite song on the album. once again another fast paced song. Reminds me of \\"Nightcrawler\\" for some reason. Whenever i listen to it i start singing \\"Nightcrawler\\", even though it doesn't sound a thing like it. Still a great song though. (4.5/5)    Eulogy: Not much of a song, more like an ending and then an intro for the last song. Not bad, there just isn't much to it. (3.5/5)    Lochness: Not bad, i just have never listnened through the whole thing. They tried to make an epic song and it just doesn't hold my intrest. I guess i'm just spoiled by Maiden who have mastered the art of making an epic song. (3/5)    Overall: 76/100-C    All in all, not Priest quality, but those four or five amazing songs are worth the price alone. I enjoy it, but if your looking for a good CD to buy, go listne to \\"Sad Wings of Destiny\\" and \\"Sin After Sin\\" again.    Check out these tracks:  \\"Judas Rising\\"  \\"Demonizer\\"  \\"Hellrider\\"  \\"Deal With the Devil\\"  \\"Angel\\"
B0002OERI0|5.0|I've always sort of liked Green Day, but I am now an official fan! The lyrics are edgey and the music will have you singing them all day long! This is defintely one of the best albums of the year.
B0007DAZW8|2.0|WOW, I am really shocked!  Hmmmm, I am downright mad that I not only bought this but am trying to find a reason to like it just because IT IS DAFT PUNK.  Another reviewer said they are \\"going back to their roots?\\"  What are you talking about!?  There are no roots on this album!  It's more of a new experimental electro album ,with Daft Punk feel, full of never ending loops and robot voices!  I kept waiting for a song to change or kick into high gear, but no! Honestly, I would rather listen to just a kick drum and hi-hats all day than this!  <br />I shall calm for a second and tell you I did enjoy Track 9-\\"Technologic\\"  It seems to be the only track they put any thought into...and it's on the lyrical end of the spectrum. <br />Seriously folks, if you want experimental Daft Punk, buy Thomas Bangalter's soundtrack for IRREVERSIBLE.  If you want Daft Punk as we've come to love........STAY AWAY FROM THIS and rebuy any of the other albums!!!  (WHIMPER, WHIMPER, WHIMPER!)
B000002MG1|4.0|R.E.M. have created a masterpiece with Automatic For the People.  I believe it to be their best album and that is saying something when you look at their impressive catalog!  All successful albums, in my opinion, must have an atmosphere that draws the whole album together.  It cannot just have one massive hit single that blows the rest of the album away.  This album is chock full of gems and not only are the lyrics beautiful but the music itself haunts you after you're done listening.  A must have for any music collection.  Key tracks are \\"Drive, Man on the Moon\\", \\"Everybody Hurts\\", and \\"Nightswimming\\".
B000068PQ0|5.0|The sticker on the cover of the CD I bought reads:    \\"The greatest album released in Uncut's lifetime...\\" 5 1/2 out of 5 stars - Uncut (UK)  \\"An artisitic triumph\\" - Spin (US)  \\"The band's most delicate and sophisticated work yet...\\" 5 stars - The Times (UK)  \\"Yoshimi...sets yet another benchmark\\" 9/10 - NME  \\"Their second masterpiece\\" 4 out of 5 stars - Q Magazine  \\"...a serious headtrip\\" 4 out of 5 stars - Rolling Stone.    I wasn't familiar with the Flaming Lips' music. Frankly, their name turned me off. But I heard the song \\"Do You Realise?\\" on VH1 and decided to investigate. I ended up taking a chance on this album and found that it is clearly the best CD I've listened to this century, but I find that I can't define it. The closest thing to a definition would be - imagine Neil Young singing for Pink Floyd! It affected me in the same way as it did Ian Aldis - it definately grows on the listener. The first time through I thought it was strange. The third and fourth times through Koshimi just blew me away. Now I can see why it received the reviews above.    What is it so good?     Is it the sense of theatre that is missing in todays music? The first half of this concept album is based on the fight by a young girl - Yoshimi, a \\"blackbelt in karate\\", against an invading force of evil robots, apparently similar to either Asimov's \\"I Robot\\" or even Wells' \\"War of the Worlds\\".     Or is it the brilliant production and conception which combines beautiful melodies with subtle electronic notes and blips? Or is it the genuiness of the singer's heartfelt mid-western twang? Track one, \\"Flight Test\\", is a catchy acoustic song that harkens back to Cat Stevens' \\"Father and Son\\", both in melody and lyrical content. Here we discover the danger through the singer's reluctance to challenge the robots \\"'cause I'm a man not a boy and there are things you can't avoid, you have to face them when you're not prepared to face them\\". On the second track, he contemplates the psychologicaldifferences between humans and his captors. His hopes now rest on the planet's saviour Yoshimi (another acoustic track). She goes on to battle the robots on the instrumental track 4; probably the most frenzied this album gets, with some electronic sound effects reminscient of Pink Floyd's \\"On the Run\\".     The second half of the album is not as clear conceptually. Is the singer reflecting on his life during or after the battle? Or is he contemplating future life while the battle progresses? I'm not sure, but the songs are increadibly moving. For instance, the lyrics on track 6 \\"Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell\\" read \\"I was wanting you to love me, but your love never came...I was waiting on a moment, but the moment never came\\". On track 9 \\"Do you Realise?\\" he asks \\"Do you realise that you have the most beautiful face? Do you realise we're floating in space?\\" This is truly an amazing album.     Even though I can hear elements of a few great bands; including, post 'OK Computer' Radiohead, early 70's Pink Floyd and David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust, this is a unique album from a very, very good band. I am shocked at the outstanding quality of the whole production and the ability of the songwriters. I thoroughly recommend that if you collect rock masterpieces, you need to proudly sit \\"Yoshimi\\" on your top shelf.
0316666343|4.0|The Lovely Bones is about a fourteen year old girl, Susie Salmon, who was brutally murdered and raped by her eccentric neighbor, Mr. Harvey. Written from the perspective of the murdered girl as she watches her family and friends cope with her murder and grow individually, the Lovely Bones is fascinating and truly original. So many other novels and movies end with the main character dying, but this one begins with the main character already dead, an ingenious idea on Ms. Sebold's part. It was refreshing to read a novel thats theme has not been used by so many other authors. <br /> <br />The concept of Heaven was unique. I had never thought of Heaven in the way that Ms. Sebold depicts it, and although I do not agree with all of her descriptions (for instance, only people who have similar interests and desires share your heaven) of Heaven, it is an interesting way to imagine it. <br /> <br />Although I thought the book was amazing, there were two disappointments. The first was the way Susie's mother dealt with her daughter's death. I was disheartened to read that she had an affair with the leading detective in her daughter's investigation. In a time where her family needed her most, Susie's mother not only had an affair but abandoned the family. The second disappointment was when Mr. Harvey died in a freakish accident. As a reader, I was hoping that Mr. Harvey would get caught. Although I think that he deserved death, being caught would have done more justice to the novel and the story. <br /> <br />The scene where Susie slips into Ruth's body to make love was too scripted and not authentic. It was like watching bad acting where the actors show no emotion or depth because they are struggling to remember their lines. The novel still would have been amazing had this part been omitted. <br /> <br />The two thirds of the novel was phenomenal. Once I started to read the book, I couldn't get enough; it was addicting. Towards the end, it began to repeat itself and it seemed to drag on. <br /> <br />However, I highly recommend reading this book to anyone. It showcases Ms. Sebold's great literary talents and it was an excellent novel.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Well, if you are reading all these customer reviews and you aren't utterly convinced of the quality of Firefly, then you are one stubborn shopper.  It's time to take a leap of faith, and become one of the vast legions of Firefly fans....
B00000099Y|5.0|first off i would like to say that i am a lover of all great music.  although i hate most country music there is still the odd country song that i like. What i am trying to say is that i dont want to be one of those guys that says \\"go buy this album right now it is a masterpiece\\". but i have to because this album is unbelievable. like many others have said it is very layered and the transition in the songs is remarkable. How tool can go from soft distant drowning music to slap you in the face knock you on your ass rock all within the same song and make it work is unreal. i also dont understand what people are talking about when they say u have to listen to the album ten times before they start to like it. I liked it almost immediately with songs like stinkfist, 46 and 2, enema, and eulogy. Danys drumming is insane. the beats are never the same and always mind-blowing. I saw them in concert and all though they are not the biggest crowd pleasers their live show blew my mind away. I would not recommend this album to everyone because you really have to appreciate whats going on to like it. I have many friends who hate tool and thats cool. its just not their type of music. I also know lots of people who love this album just as much as me. Anyways, great album. P.s. this is the only review i have ever written so plz excuse it if it is drab or repeititve.    Part 2 of review  For all u real musics lovers who cannot beleive that someone would give this album less then 5 stars just think about this. Consider the source. Look at the other reviews of all the people who gave this album 1 star. They love bands like aerosmith(crappy 80's band) good charolette(possibly one of the worst bands to come of the generic music machine) and slipknot. people who like crappy music dont even get my ear when they try to rate real music. Their opinion doesnt even count. go back to your simple plan. As for the fillers on the album, i can sympathize with people who dont like them. I used to hatethem too. What the f is with 30 seconds of static? But guess what, after time(about 8 years) i started to realize something within these fillers. Even the static track has flow to it. There are background noises that lead somewhere and even the static builds up to a climax. Sounds weird but then again i could just be another brainwashed tool fan. The point is, those fillers are something DIFFERENT AND ORIGINAL. Something not found in most music today. take them for what they are. Hey that sounds kinda cool. Your not supposed to listen to those tracks over and over. another point i have is to say something about those 1 star reviewers who say \\" dont listen to everyone else they are just hardcore tool fans.\\" this is another ignorant statement. do your homework. read the other reviews. Alot of them are from people who are not tool fans but can appreiciate good music and even some of them use to HATE tool but they gave it a real chance. So dont worry, you 1 star reviewers will come around. Of course thats just my opinion i could be wrong.
B000002U82|5.0|Where do I begin? The first moment I popped in the disc, I was hooked. The first song, Speak To Me/ Breathe, starts out with faint heartbeat and slowly molds into different sounds: A cash register, tractor, and eerie laughing in the background slowly build up to the music, which begins with a sudden burst of sound. The lyrics that follow are extremely impressive and almost set you in trance for the rest of the album. Next up is on the run, which actually has a host of different different sound effects within, and is quite impressive with no vocals. <br />Time has an great message in it, and the music is top notch. This song just surroundsyou and its hard to press stop during this track. The Great Gig In The Sky, my least favorite track, has no spoken words to it, and although it has great music surrounding it, I wasn;t thrilled by the vocals. Money. Easily one ofg the best songs on here, once you hear the guitar, you can't help but to sing the words. Us and Them, My favorite track, has beautiful orchestra and vocals, and just throws you back in the quality of its sound.Any Colour You Like seamlessly integrates giutar and synthesizer to make a great track. Brain Damage has a very catch tune overall, and Eclipse is a great way to end the album. This is an absolute must have for anybody.
B000002UA0|5.0|Syd Barrett was a lost cause even before this album was released. His many acid trips landed him in a \\"happy-home\\" and an ignominious demise from the music scene. Let's face it, this is the only 'Pink Floyd'-- 'Syd Berrett' album that matters. <br />Here is one of the great pop-composers before he descended south into \\"munchkin-land\\". <br />Fans of true phychedillia must buy this album, now!
1400032717|4.0|The curious incident of the dog in the night-time provides the reader with insight to what the thought processes and social interactions a person with autism might have with the world around him. The way the main character narrates the story I feel like he is in the same room with me explaining every detail. Even more, I understand his fears and anxieties and marvel at how he overcomes them or rationalizes them down into little math equations. The author, Haddon, stays true to his eccentricities like the yellow car, red car scenario and gives his young narrator a \\"matter of fact\\" tone of voice.  <br /> <br />Do not expect Dickens quality literature because that is not this type of book, but if you are looking for a smart yet poignant story from a different understanding then I whole heartedly recommend this book.
0783225725|5.0|This was always my favorite Clint Eastwood Western.  UNFORGIVEN would come close years later, but I still enjoy DRIFTER, Clint's first Western as a director (he directed PLAY MISTY FOR ME previously).<br /><br />The supernatural touches and haunting wisps of music add another layer of mystery to the story.  Is Clint's \\"Stranger\\" a real person, or is he the restless ghost of the marshal bullwhipped to death in the streets of Lago?<br /><br />That question elevates the film from the familiar Western revenge story, by then growing a little long in the tooth by 1973.  The wholesale revenge exacted on everyone in the town as well as the thuggish killers, the sight of the entire town painted red (with \\"Hell\\" sloppily painted on its sign), the way Clint emerges from the desert heat vapors in the opening--it all gives the film a lot of style and intrigue.<br /><br />It makes for a very cool Western.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|i couldn't belive that julia roberts would involve in this boring movie ,the story is clumsy and you can't understand what they realy want,or what kind of message the director wants to deliver,,,to cut it short it's aloser movie.
B0007TKNIS|4.0|I saw the movie Phantom of the Opera and I loved it, the whole black and white thing in the beginning and then you hear the organ and goes to color, that was amazing, I never had the opportunity to see the stage version, but in Wisconsin it does not come around very often. I had goosebumps during the movie it was one of the best musicals I saw on screen.  I am a huge fan of Phantom of the Opera, and I am really looking forward to getting it on DVD and adding it to my collection.
B00005JLR8|4.0|Despite all tears you must take what really matters of this film: its simple but strong message. <br /> <br />Your heart must be ready for a lot of emotions. Your mind has to be open to understand what happens to this family. <br /> <br />It seems that struggle is the only thing this family has done for years. Both parents and both daughters are used to suffer and they live as natural everything that happens to them. They are always full of hope and wisdom, thinking that things are going to improve soon. <br /> <br />The performance of the four members of the family and their strange neighbour are despicable. The story, the plot are very impressive. This is a very good film and you don't have to take the sad part of this movie, but its message, full of hope and eternal happiness. <br /> <br />If you believe in something, go for it, whatever it takes.

I hope everyone has done their \\"Homework\\" and has learned about the \\"Discovery\\" of a certain French techno pair creating the most harmonic of surreal mixez, because we're moving on to learn some more out-of-sight tunes from the group.  We continue to learn, we're only \\"Human After All.\\"  (Clever opening, huh?)  I'm glad Daft Punk still got teh m4d sk1  z to mix another album after four years since their last LP; what took them so long?  I must thank Vh1 for giving me the chance the play the whole album on their site, so that way I can judge if \\"Human After All\\" is worth the four-year wait.  I think it is, but for the most part, I wasn't too thrilled with this LP.<br /><br />If their last album made you think of \\"Star Trek\\" or \\"Starblazers\\", then this album will made you think of \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" or \\"Blade Runner.\\"  What I mean from the pop culture memo is that \\"Human After All\\" utilizes more on synthesizerz and various sci-fi effectz to give this album a literal cyberia tune, ironically.  For the most part, the idea workz, because this album has a few great gemz within the construction.  \\"Human After All\\" startz off with a kickin' opening of the same name, which listening to it comprehendz the theme of this album; its undefined robotic synthz sets the right feeling to this dance tune.  \\"Robot Rock\\", their debut single, is definitely my favorite track of the LP due to the rhythmic variety of guitar samplez: one with the obvious synth, and the other using midi-esque riffz; I like how the \\"Robot Rock\\" speech blendz with the midi riffz.  \\"Buy it, use it, break it, fix it, trash it, change it, melt-upgrade it...\\", DAMN! I love how this opens up with \\"Technologic\\", using vocal samplez as the first background and later with real music; it has the 8£@+ and the \/!8£ for a worthy rave tune.<br /><br />I really liked the pseudo-robot capella of \\"The Prime Time Of Your Life\\", because its so on-key and catchy.  This could've been my favorite track if the second half of the song didn't fall apart with its empty monotony of a tempo-increasing background.  \\"Steam Machine\\", \\"The Brainwasher\\", and \\"Television Rules The Nation\\" are all okay: one has a great beat with a clever-yet-forceful steam vocalz, the other is serviceable, and the latter isn't quick on the subject but does right with the rough riffz.  One thing to make this clear about the album: other than \\"The Prime Time\\" and \\"Technologic\\", there's no actual singing going on.  Sure, the songz have spoken linez, but they hardly go beyond saying the name of the song's title.<br /><br />This album isn't always about robotic samplez and synthz, mind you. Daft Punk actually made some trackz that are outside of the genre barrier. The resultz aren't completely satisfying. The Funk-yet-jazzy \\"Make Love\\" providez some nice piano tune that soothez the soul of any music fan, but it gets too loopy, too quickly after 45 secondz.  And then there's the track than ended the LP with a snooze: \\"Emotion.\\"  Here's my emotionz listening to \\"emotion\\": pale, drowsy, and bored.  This energy-sucker of a song is slow, monotonous, and worse, IT'S ALMOST 7 MINUTES LONG!  X_X<br /><br />Sadly, every new type of technology has its share of flawz, and I noticed a few bugz, or misleadz, here in this album.  For one thing, almost all of the songz are too repetitive, for a techno album that's meant to consist of loop after loop.  If you were able to listen to the song samplez on this Amazon page or elsewhere, that's almost exactly what you're going to hear throughout those songz.  Another b-slap is that \\"Human After All\\" is short on the time (40-45 minutes) AND on the track list with only ten trackz; well, nine trackz if you can cross out the unneeded \\"On/Off\\" interlude.  You think after four yearz in hiatus, the group could've add some more trackz in their album production.<br /><br />Disappointed, that I am with this new album.  While\\"Human After All\\" incorporated some nifty musical ideaz on their third try, the songz aren't too memorable and this album is barely an upgrade from Daft Punk's early versionz.  But I'm not saying this album sux0rz, it's just mildly enjoyable.  Daft Punk fans and such would probably but this album anyway, regardless of the problems I describe, so to those who love the things about the first two LPz would find the same satisfaction with \\"Human After All\\", though probably much less.<br /><br />/=!/ /@ _ \/\/0 2 )$: teh pretty daft LP.<br /><br />[BEST TRACK: Robot Rock]<br /><br />[FAVORITE SONGS: Human After All, Technologic, The Prime Time Of Your Life]<br /><br />[WEAKEST TRACK: Emotion]on their third try, the songz aren't too memorable and this album is barely an upgrade from Daft Punk's early versionz.

B0001LJCPC|4.0|This is a decent soundtrack. However, one of the things I was looking forward to that I didn't find on the soundtrack would be Robert Rodrieguez's original score music. Specifically a sinister instrumental reprise of Nancy Sinatra's \\"Bang Bang\\" and a melancholy theme for Budd (Micheal Madsen). <br /> <br />However, the strangely appealing, jazzy, paranoid track \\"Goodnight Moon\\" by Shivaree almost makes up for it.
0761119752|5.0|One of our favorite Boynton books (and we DO love them ALL)  We have read it almost every night since my 2 year old nephew was born.  Now, he sits in our lap as we bounce him to the left, bounce him to the right!   <br />This book is also a great way to teach children that our voices can be loud and soft, and a kind way to teach the meaning of \\"hush, hush!\\"  Like other Boynton books, it has a nice rhythm, and you can turn your nightly reading into a sing along!
B00005JMUA|5.0|Now, I very rarely agree with the academy. I think David Carridine deserved an Oscar nod (not necessarily the award itself, but a nod) for his portrayal of Bill in \\"Kill Bill vol 2\\". He created the character perfectly. He had great dialogue, compliments of Quentin, and he knew exactly what to do with it. You feel for him, you get excited when he's on screen. He was, in a word, excellent. <br /> <br />As for everyone else...Uma is great as always. I'll admit Darryl Hannah is a bit over-the-top, but I think it works. Micheal Madsen makes you feel kind of sorry for Budd...he was the only one who seemed to show real remorse (anyone else notice he bears an odd resemblance to Robert Rodriguez, who is from Terantino's home planet?).
B00023BLXK|4.0|It's understandable that any follow-up to a cult classic such as \\"Dirty Dancing\\" will be ripped apart regardless of its actual performance.  That's because viewers step into the movie with a mindset of preconceived notions and expectations.  I must admit that I was one of those viewers, avoiding this film at all costs, until this past weekend. <br /> <br />That's when I entered the world of \\"Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights\\" and fell in love with what I saw.  I honestly feel as if this movie has some of the sexiest dance scenes I've seen, and the art direction is simply fabulous.  The costumes and hairstyling are also very well done.  Although mainstream American  audiences will not recognize most of the cast members, Diego Luna puts on an amazing act as Javier Suarez, an intelligent, enticing waiter at a Cuban resort.  Jonathan Jackson's performance as a slick badboy is a little unconvincing, but then again, many of the film's characters go underdeveloped. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, I'd still recommend \\"DD:HN\\" just for the sake of fun.  It's perfect for a night in with the girls or even for spending time with a significant other.  If you  have already seen it and think it's terrible, try watching it for similarities with its predecessor and come to appreciate the captivating uniqueness that is \\"Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights.\\" :)

B0007CNXUK|5.0|I saw this movie in a small town theater with my girlfriend. Going into it, I expected good things...with the combination of Johnny Depp's acting and a story about fairies and imagination. But I have to admit, this movie blew me away. Rarely have I seen a movie that evokes such emotion without resorting to cheesy, overused one-liners. <br /> <br />There is one point in the story, during a performance of Barrie's play, \\"Peter Pan,\\" when a character says, \\"Clap if you believe in fairies.\\" Well I must say, there were a good many people clapping in the audience, both young and old. At the end of the movie, everyone was in or near tears. I was one of them, though not primarily because of sadness; just because the movie was so darn well done. <br /> <br />Many types of people will enjoy this movie - the elderly who remember a more innocent time as well as families who want to experience some quality entertainment together. This is a solid movie all around, and in fact was my favorite new release of 2004.
B0000028UK|5.0|I absolutely love this album! It's Pearl Jam taking a defiant stand against the rest of the world.  The anger and resentment just flows, as if the supply was never-ending. With defiant rockers such as 'Animal', 'Go', 'Leash' and 'Blood', you'll find yourself wanting to put a hole through the wall.  <br /> <br />The album does have its quieter moments, though.  I found myself pondering the meaning of life after listening to 'Indifference' and thinking about days gone by with a song like 'Elderly Woman...'. <br /> <br />Either way, the musicianship is excellent and it's easy to get swept away in the overall mood of this disc. It's helped me to get through some of the more difficult parts of my adolescence. <br /> <br />A great journey!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I never thought it would be 2005 and I would be so completely on Green Day's d**k, I haven't paid any attention since to them since \\"Dookie,\\" but this album has restored my faith in rock.  I'm so glad that the punk purists who used to rail on Green Day for selling out have grown up and sold out themselves so these guys can be left alone to do what they do best which is write great music. \\"American Idiot\\" could have been overtly political in a cheesy diss Bush kind of way like that terrible Beastie Boys track that I can't remember the name of. Instead, Green Day rips into middle America because after all, it's not Bush that's the problem, it's the scary people that voted for Bush that are the problem. You know the type: watching the world go by through the gates of their suburban castles, screaming into cell phones, stuffing McDonald's in their fat faces and chasing it all down with Paxil and Prilosec to keep the vomit from spilling across their new Nike tennis shoes. The Jesus of Suburbia is a lie, no one can save you but yourself.
B000683VI4|4.0|The previews of the movie seemed more exciting, and the happy ending seemed a little too much. but I was drawn to it and I felt at times nostalgic
B00028HBKM|4.0|Was there a Jesus?  Given that the earliest gospel was set down some forty years after the given date for Jesus' execution, and that the only other \\"reputable\\" reference is ascribed to Flavius Josephus (himself something of a fabulist [as well as a Jew swayed to things Roman -- unlike Saul/Paul -- to whom we may owe all that is currently recognizable as Jesus]), who can be sure.  But Mel Gibson is sure -- as sure in his Catholic beliefs, as his father is sure that there was no Holocaust (a fascinating juxta- (junta?) position, this: papa damns the Jews as liars, son creates an equivalent holocaust movie for Christians starring a Jew).  And the movie?  Well, cinematically, it is dazzling -- sepia to blood-red tones, sure-handed editing, appropriate Latin and Aramaic dialogue (with subtitles), horrific (as well as reputedly accurate) special effects, meticulous sets and costumes, a wrenching soundtrack, performances that rival (and sometimes surpass) anything on the silent screen (where dialogue was unnecessary given the emotive skills of the actors), and a direction (by Gibson) that is unrelenting in its graphic presentation of Christianity's first (and greatest) martyr.  But, throughout, I was driven to ask myself, what faith, what God, would compel a man to suffer what the Jesus (Jim Caveziel) in this film suffered?  And, what God, faith, disciple or follower, would so demand, expect or allow these agonies to be endured by one who ostensibly taught and lived love, tolerance and forgiveness?  Buddhism says, simply, that life is hard but suffering is optional; it is our choice whether we live gladly or painfully (Hamlet's \\"there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so\\"); we need not seek out suffering to prove ourselves or to make ourselves more worthy (\\"better\\").  I thus found myself watching and wishing Jesus would let everyone -- himself included -- off the hook; that he would show compassion for himself -- as well as for those who loved him -- andwere looking on -- by not getting painfully to his feet for a more brutal beating, by not staying silent when before Pilate, etc.  Which then is the real and last temptation (with apologies to Kazantzakis) -- giving oneself over to a great matyrdom (and its accompanying saint-like gratification) or allowing it to be visited -- horribly -- on a loved one; imagine the anguish of Jesus' disciples, and that of both Marys, who chose to stand by while their master, brother, son, god, was beaten, tortured and then hung from a tree?  Romans, in an occupied country, were horrifically pragmatic -- crucifixions were cheap, they were public, they were often and they were bloody -- as any good deterrent against insurrection should be (proponents of capital punishment -- and I am not one of them -- arguing it as a deterrent should reconsider public executions).  And they were unforgettable -- remember the crucified along the Appian Way after the rebellion of Spartacus?  Gibson spares us nothing. It is as if he is testing our faith by asking us to endure -- visually -- all that he believes his Jesus endured.  And, like those who slow down on a public highway to get a better look at a traffic accident, we don't turn away.  \\"What's next?\\" we ask inside ourselves.  \\"What new horror will be be visited on this poor man?\\"  And, those with faith, both in the story and in the man, might be asking as well \\"do I deserve God's grace if the cost is such extreme suffering visited on one man?\\" <br /> <br />The Passion is a very ably done film; but is close to unendurable; its excesses (and they are exactly that, however skillfully brought off) are inexcusable; I was left feeling as if I'd endured ringside seats at the first snuff film starring God.  God help me. <br />
B00001NFCY|3.0|'Human clay' is an example of what one should not do with music.First of all one should never make a formula for music and suppose if u make one..then please...one should not overdo it...it kills.People may love it(as i loved it) for sometime...but it stops grabbing you(as all good music does....always) after sometime.I would rather advice you to buy their debut(My own Prison) instead...its Creed's best.    Now suppose if you dont mind formula stuck repetitiveness,then this album is fairly decent.Its power chord heavy and also has some good lyrics(for the lyrically inclined).In the beginning it will surely kinda rule your player(you will love the way this album comes out of your speakers)...but then it will loose the frequency of play..which happened with me.    But still its worth your money if you havent heard Tool;-).
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Honestly...the first time I watched this I didn't laugh too much. However, I gave it another chance and I'm glad I did. I knew that it wasn't supposed to appeal to everyones sense of humor when I watched it the first time, and was more disappointed in myself than in the movie for not appreciating it more.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, if you dont get it the first time slip in the dvd one more time and watch it again...the more you watch it the funnier it gets....oh and vote for Pedro :)
140004281X|5.0|Munro is an extremely gifted writer who has the unique talent of keeping a woman's life in focus from adolescence to senescence. She plumbs the depths of her characters' emotional lives and finds beautiful expressive language at the same time. In the first story in this collection, \\"Runaway,\\" a surprise ending shows how a husband can wreak revenge on his abused wife when she returns after leaving him unexpectedly.<br /><br /> In the first of my favorite set of stories, \\"Chance,\\" Juliet, a young Classics teacher leading a stunted life in Ontario, takes a fateful train ride and encounters a man from B.C. whose wife is dying; she later starts an unorthodox relationship with him but learns he already has a woman, Christa. (Many of Munro's characters are teachers or scholars.) \\"In the town where she grew up her sort of intelligence was often put in the same category as a limp or an extra thumb, and people had been quick to point out the expected accompanying drawbacks--her inability to run a sewing machine or tie up a neat parcel, or notice that her slip was showing. What would become of her, was the question.\\" In a store, a woman says, \\"So that's the girl who talks Latin.\\"<br /><br /> The story is continued in \\"Soon,\\" which concerns Juliet's trip home with her baby daughter, Penelope. It is 1969. She takes leave of Christa, who has become her friend. When they get there, Juliet finds her mother dying of heart trouble and her father tied down by manual labor after being fired as a teacher for being too outspoken. The story ends in \\"Silence,\\" with time speeded up. Penelope, first adolescent and then grown, disappears from her mother's life without explanation, and Juliet's live-in companion, Eric, drowns; Christa becomes her best friend but then falls ill. Munro explores both the heartaches and the walling-in of emotions these events cause, and how Juliet continues through the years remaining to her.<br /><br /> The remaining stories in the collection tell of an encounter between a woman and a sexy alcoholic, a trip up a country road to scatter someone's ashes, two Shakespearean parodies about mix-up of twins, and the life-stream of a woman who marries the wrong man and whose friend has powers of second sight about the right one. Several stories contain women characters who seem hard and rigid and disapproving, but always for an inner reason, a burden of pain.<br /><br /> Munro almost literally has her finger on the pulse of people's hearts. For that reason alone, I can't do justice to her work. It's just something in which you immerse yourself.encounter between a woman and a sexy alcoholic, a trip up a country road to scatter someone's ashes, two Shakespearean parodies about mix-up of twins, and the life-stream of a woman who marries the wrong man and whose friend has powers of second sight about the right one.

B0006GAOBI|2.0|I thought that the original release of donie darko was the best movie I've ever seen, and I was looking foward to the directors cut, but once I saw it I was very disapointed to see how badly he butchered this fantastic film. Many of the key scenes were alterd, ruining some of the best moments in the film, and the eye ball thing that was added before incounters with frank was just plain retarded. Also this version was way too dumbed down, the showing of portions of the book as well as the added scene in the end with grandma death, told far too much. The original release really made you think, and took several veiwing for you to truely grasp everything, but this version lays everything out for you, turning one of the most complex movies I've seen into just your average ordinary run of the mill film. If you havent seen donnie darko yet go out and buy the original, and if you already own the original, this dvd will just disapoint you.
0446310786|3.0|I would recommend this book mostly for its sumptious descriptions of the American South in the 1930s. Through Scout's tomboy eyes, we get a glimpse of societal customs, children's games, weather superstitions and a privileged's child's race observations all emulsified in the tastes and smells of the Deep South. The rich descriptions of the world around the narrator is in my view the novel's main strenght.<br /><br />That said, I must admit I was quite surprised at how one-dimensional and predictable the main characters were, and the main race issue is largely a mixture of the tiresome \\"Uncle Tom\\" phenomenon and white liberal smugness. I was quite dismayed that the black folks were portrayed as little more than good-natured simpletons with just the right amount of \\"colored wisdom\\", while the enlightened white minority (who, if you are a white reader, you are to identify yourself with) are the good and noble characters in an evil and prejudiced world.<br />Furthermore, for good measure, the rednecks are given all the convenient charcteristics of being the truly evil representation of the white race, closely followed by the stereotypical white gossiping Ladies who \\"sip their tea and eat their dainties\\" and busy themselves with charity work while reiterating every cliched racial hypocracy imaginable.<br /><br />In my view, if Harper Lee had dared to infuse her characters with more realistic humanity and depth beyond Good and Evil, this would have been a more compelling and honest story about race relations. As the story stands, the white reader gets his white guilt assuaged by being able to identify himself with the saint, while the black reader gets little more than the charitable handout to feel good about himself simply because he belongs to a repressed group of good people. I am not quite sure which race should feel more insulted...<br /><br />That said, I still enjoyed other parts of the book. The children's fascination and impatient curiosity with the mysterious neighbor is delightful reading (even though this very person predictably ends up a hero). The narrator's notions of first love also feels genuine and compelling as does the close realtionship between the narrator and her older protective brother.<br /><br />All in all, I would recommended the book as a look into the adolescent culture of the rural South; however, I would stick to the history books when it comes to learning about the true nature of the extreme racism that polluted the area during this time period.ding (even though this very person predictably ends up a hero).

B000777J2S|4.0|In the new world of post-cabaret, what sets Antony and the Johnsons apart from your Nellie McKay, your Rufus Wainwright, your Dresden Dolls is the voice, the literal and then the metaphoric one.  Antony's vibrato - off-putting at first, or simply unusual - shares the timbre and shadings of early-Bryan Ferry circa Country Life.  On their second release, I Am a Bird Now, Antony and the Johnsons speak for changelings of every stripe, specifically to the travails of the transgender community.  If that sounds exclusionary, maybe it is, yet I Am a Bird Now is bracing from start to finish.  Antony's songs - from \\"My Lady Story\\" to \\"You Are My Sister\\" to the Motown-styled \\"Fistful of Love\\" - are certainly specific to his place in the world, and sensitive to the plight of the sexually confused (or not so confused, as it turns out).  Yet a plaint as simple as \\"For Today I Am a Boy\\" - in which Antony prays to one day \\"grow up to be a beautiful woman\\" - is heartbreaking, because who hasn't wanted to one day grow up to be something other than what they are?  Which is to say that there is the pop specific and universal in his songs about a man who feels like a woman getting by in a man's world.  Rumor has it that Lou Reed is a big fan, and that Antony's songs make him cry.  If Lou Reed sheds a tear for this fierce and talented outsider, what chance do we mere mortals have?
B00003CXDD|5.0|I'm seventeen years old, and I'm surprised that I'm one of the few people that didn't watch this movie as a child. Being one of the people raised on fantasy movies as a child, I found this movie to be moving, enchanting, and fantastically magical! I've seen many reviews of this movie in which some people detested it or even called most of the elements, plot, visuals, etc. just mediocre. But I just want to say, that beyond the movie critics' reviews, there are the average people who are not related in any way to the film industry, who have watched this movie and simply been moved. For me, it takes a lot for a movie to actually fall onto my must-watch list. This is one of those movies. It is magical, whether you watch it as a child or later on in life, you will be touched, I'll almost asure you. Many people say it falls behind in the Fantasy/Adventure genre, saying that there are other movies out there that topped this one. I've seen many fantasy movies, The Princess Bride, The Labyrinth, etc. and I've loved them all, but if I had to pick which one I was touched the most by, this would be the one! Val Kilmer and Warwick Davis give absolutely amazing performances as well as the rest of the cast, although the one thing that did annoy me was the appearance of the BROWNIES. I didn't feel that they were needed that much in the film, they just kind of got in the way. But as for the enchanting tale of finding an abandoned princess who will eventually destroy the evil queen and tracking out on an unforgettable adventure-- that's the kind of story that will stay in your memories and your children's memories for years to come! I would highly recommend this movie to anyone out there, fantasy lover or not!
B0007O38F8|3.0|The music on this CD is not bad...way too many songs, but there are some shining moments. And honestly, Candy Shop is just a rehashed Magic Stick. But...however...looking at the photos of the CD booklet, and how 50, one of today's youth's heroes, poses with guns, cocaine and whores, and how he has become to be idolized, is clearly, clearly, clearly the sign of a sick society and culture who puts people like this and their messages on a pedastol. It could be freedom of speech, but this sort of stuff makes me think that freedom of speech has become perverted, and now we're living the days of a society going through a freewheeling downward spiral. Sure, buy this CD, enjoy the music, but try to think about what sort of message this sends out to today's people. Also think that many people who listen to this music are practically illiterate, have never been outside of their hoods, and have no idea that there is a better world (or a different world) than the poison which this glorifies. Through the internet, and its daily displays of graphic photos, irresponsible media producers, and through music like this we have become completely calloused and indifferent and apathetic to humanity. Bravo, 50!
B00006LLOB|4.0|Given the drubbing over the years by purists and other blues snobs who never liked the idea of impressionable rock-star Brits recording with their American blues legend masters, I expected this disc to sound as bad as other entries in this genre, such as the Chuck Berry London sessions.  Surprise!!  It's a lot better than expected.<br /><br />  Pinned by Wolf's regular guitarist and joined by an on-fire Eric Clapton, these recordings are spirited, enjoyable, and go down real easy.  Stevie Winwood contributes solid organ/piano lines,and the bass and drum support of Stones engines Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman is effortless and in the pocket.<br /><br />Why the criticism?  I think it's mostly intellectual, rather than visceral.  Yes, Wolf has sounded better, and the concept is a bit cute, but the results speak for themselves and stand the test of time.  This is a comfort album, more for kicking back and enjoying the groove, rather than for someone looking for the definitive performance by any of the participants.<br /><br />One point mentioned by a fellow reviewer with which I totally agree:  The \\"bonus\\" disk is a shameless attempt to charge double the normal price for this re-release.  There's nothing in it worth paying for.  The best part of the rehearsal sessions is actually on the original release, where a cranky Wolf shows Clapton how to properly play the slide guitar....priceless, memorable, and one of the small charms of this album.
1593072937|4.0|With a name like \\"The Hard Goodbye,\\" it isn't surprising that the first volume of the Sin City series is pure, gritty noir. After practically reinventing the superhero comic, Frank Miller created a series that can definitely be called his opus -- gritty, dark, sexy and heady. Think of it as \\"The Big Sleep\\" meets \\"Kill Bill.\\"<br /><br />\\"The night is hot as hell. Everything sticks.\\" With those words, tough, scarred Marv encounters and beds a beautiful, alluring \\"goddess\\" named Goldie. No sooner have they made love than she is found dead beside him, and unsurprisingly the police believe that Marv is the killer. Case closed? Not really.<br /><br />Being blamed for the murder of the woman he loved, Marv devotes himself to finding who killed her and framed him. He rampages through the depths of Sin City, unearthing the twisted power structure that holds it up -- and in his homicidal quest, destroying his hidden enemies for the murder of Goldie... and in the process, dooming himself.<br /><br />The noir atmosphere starts from the first panel -- toughguyspeak, a silhouette and a beautiful woman. That dark, dirty feel sets the mood for the book, and in fact for the entire series. Imagine one of those old Humphrey Bogart noir movies, with the smoky atmosphere and black-and-white film... but darker, more violent, openly sexual, and often gruesome in tone.<br /><br />Miller's drawing style is all in black and white, and in \\"Hard Goodbye\\" the style is simple, but effective. He uses stark swashes of dark and light to illustrate the characters' faces and bodies, never overburdening the reader with too many unnecessary details. Although later volumes have more visual detail, Miller strips it down here to the bare bones, and it fits the spare narrative beautifully.<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" itself is a seedy underbelly, full of crime, revenge and corruption; Marv isn't the guy who's going to clean it up, a la Dashiell Hammett, but the guy who will get revenge, no matter what the consequences are. The characters are just as dark: a corrupted Cardinal, psychopathic cannibal Kevin, and moderately crooked cops. Lots of death ensues.<br /><br />Frank Miller's \\"Sin City: The Hard Goodbye\\" is a hard book to read. However, the Chander-by-way-of-Tarantino comic book is an electrifying read, dark and bloody and vivid.dark: a corrupted Cardinal, psychopathic cannibal Kevin, and moderately crooked cops.

0670033375|4.0|This is a really interesting book.  Mind expanding I would say.  Like his previous book Guns Germs & Steel, it will have a profound impact on the way you look at the world. <br /> <br />Even though many misguided critics try to label Diamond as \\"politically correct\\", one of his major achievements in this book is to demolish the \\"politically correct\\" myth that environmental degradation is unique to western industrial societies, and that other primitive peoples lived in harmony with nature.  To the contrary he demonstrates quite convincingly that environmental mismanagement had devastating effects on multiple societies which had never had any contact with western civilization. <br /> <br />Like his previous book, Collapse weaves together a fantastic breadth of scientific knowledge- how agricultural practices lead to the salinization of aquifers, the effect of volcanic ash replentishing soil nutrients, cyanide leaching, the use of rat middens to study environmental history... the book is just full of fascinating scientific details, woven together into a story which, for certain chapters, reads like a historical mystery novel.  His unraveling of the fates of dead civilizations has a \\"page turner\\" quality which is difficult to put down. <br /> <br />Some of the later chapters on modern civilizations read more like a laundry list of environmental problems and are not as cohesive, that would be my one criticism and is why I didn't give it a full five stars. <br /> <br />One intellectually challenged reviewer called this book \\"anti-civilization\\".  If the incoherence and idiocy of critics is any measure of worth, this book is certainly a great one.
0596007124|5.0|This is finally the book that helped me identify design patterns. Do this kind of work long enough and you'll encounter them or discover them for yourself, but now at least I can talk about them by name. I learned about a few as well. This is real quality academic stuff without reading like something that Ben Stein is speaking. It's a horribly boring subject, and yet this is interesting to read. <br /> <br />The book is intended for a Java audience, but if you know C#, most of the book is just as relevant. The syntax is very similar, and they only reference Java-specific stuff a couple of times.
B00028HBKM|1.0|\\"The Passion\\" is simply a technical masterpiece. Set designs, cinemaphotgraphy, and score are flawless. If there is any reason at all to watch this, it's because of the exeptional structure of the film itself. <br />The STORY on the other hand is well, WAIT! There is no story here. Mel Gibson took every bit of detail of Christ's life and decides that it would be cool to make a two and a half hour DEATH EXTRAVAGANZA! Honestly who in their right mind actually can say they LOVE this film? It's all unbearably flinching, graphically ultra violent piece of garbage. I think even Christ himself would want to ring Gibson's neck for making this. Watching \\"The Passion\\" makes you wonder if Gibson dilebratly wanted his audience cry. I'm serious. There wasn't anyone in the theater that was bawling their eyes out. This could make the most macho-est most manly-est butch guy out there shed tears but I must ask, \\"What for!\\" Is this Gibson's effort to get the general public back into the churches? Guess what? It worked and that's what's the crying shame. Instead of the audience finding their spirituality on thier own, Gibson puts them on the biggest guilt trip ever. The joke is on you! <br />As for the anti-semitism, I'll say this, PLEASE! We all killed Christ! No one stopped it!No one did a damn thing to prevent it! I am too blame, you are to blame, we are all to blame! So, no offense Jews but there's no need to take all the credit. <br />PEACE!
B00005JMYI|3.0|I had a chance to check out \\"Anchorman\\" not too long ago. I didn't have too high expectations, though I'd heard good things about it. Well: the movie left me scratching my head. It sure had some funny moments, but for the most part it reminded me of how boring of an experience watching \\"Old School\\" was: thematically, it was lame, and it made me wonder how good a comedian can Will Ferrell be, while continuing to pull off such bad movies. I won't recommend it, not even if you have nothing else to do on a weekend night.
B000002L42|5.0|To me the mark of a good band is their ability to maintain quality in live performances.  Steely Dan is known as a group who have slick, heavily produced studio albums and I was surprised and pleased that their \\"live\\" sound maintained the quality.
B00003CX9W|5.0|Fantasia is one of those movies I have grown to love more and more every time I watch it. It's so unlike anything else Disney did before or after, and it's even unique compared against other animated movies. I find fascinating the fact that the visuals follow the music, something very different from the typical approach, where the movie is put together and the music comes in as an element of the post-production stage.<br /><br />Then, the visuals themselves depart in radically different directions. Some tag alongside the metaphors hinted at by the pieces (Beethoven's Pastoral, for example, is visually accompanied by mythological figures that perfectly embody the idea behind the composition), and then other segments are quite simply abstract, to say the least.<br /><br />When you put the whole thing together, with the whole introductions preceeding every piece, the result is a work of art, that you cannot judge by the same standards we've grown used to when watching Nemo, Beauty and the Beast or other less contemporary animation standards, such as Snow White. Fantasia created a genre on which it stands almost by itself, untouched, except by some excerpts of movies from the Japanese genius Miyazaki.
B0000026UL|4.0|I went back for the first time in years to Oh Mercy because of the long chapter in Chronicles that Dylan devotes to its making and to his stress-ridden but fruitful collaboration on it with Daniel Lanois.  A Lanois production in this day and age is as distinctive as Phil Spector's work was in the 60's and 70's.  But what's fascinating to me is that despite the multi-tracking, the use of reverb, and unique instrumentation (love the saxophone ending on Where Teardrops Fall!), the heavy sound never banishes intimacy.  And Dylan has seldom written less obliquely about intimacy and fragility of relationships than on Mercy, with classics Most of the Time, Man in the Long Black Coat, and -- best of all -- Shooting Star.  Similarly, the production in the two jangling rockers, aural caffeine if I've ever heard it, Political World and Everything is Broken, wraps but does not bury the despairing news Dylan delivers.  Mercy, as its title suggests, also gives us Dylan at his most compassionate in Ring Them Bells, a work that lyrically celebrates and forgives us all.  What Good Am I?, an unremarkable oral self-flagellation, and the musical disaster Disease of Conceit keep Mercy from being one of Dylan's half-dozen best records.  Despite those throwaways, listening again to Mercy provides abundant hindsight evidence that the decade-later Dylan/Lanois collaboration Time Out of Mind was no surprise blast of Dylan renewal.  Rather, it was a more finished and brilliant melding of a Dylan direction in sound and words that began here with Oh Mercy in New Orleans in the late '80s.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|These guys wear many different hats, sometimes all at once, yet somehow they can pull it off. Bringing together music from many different styles and genres (punk, jazz, latin, classic rock, etc.)into one amazing piece of art. For me they are best described as a mix of Pink Floyd and At The Drive-In (the singer and guitarist/songwriters' former band). Like \\"De-Loused In the Comatorium\\" (TMV's first full length)this is ment to be listened to as a whole, not just a collection of songs. Each song runs into the next, continueing the journey through it's many peaks and valleys. This idea worked well for \\"De-Loused\\", but not as well this time around. Some of the sounds and noises between what are obviously recognizable as the songs seem forced and to just be filler. This doesn't always add to the experience of a continuous album as a whole. This is the only draw back to this album, because the actual songs here are amazing. Howling vocals (in english, spanish, and latin!), shredding guitars, haunting keyboards, beatiful horns, and thunderous drums, this album has it all. If you're a fan of eclecting and progressive music, you will love this. I actually give this 4 1/2 stars but they have no 1/2's in the rating system.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|Just watch this flick and you'll understand why.  I've seen grade \\"B\\" movies 10 times more entertaining and well written, that includes 80's movies.  The werewolf wasn't too bad, and Kate Beckingsdale looked good as always, but that won't save a movie with two good points to about 30 negatives.  I think seppuku would be preferable than ever watching that movie again, <br />and that's being generous.If you must see it, rent it.  Or visit someone who actually bought it and see what I'm talking about.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Amazing! This album is an epic adventure that gives greek mythology a run for it's money. Imagine falling asleep and waking up in a nightmare/dreamland. You then take a hit of acid and get on the ride The Pirates of the Caribbean, which then connects to Space Mountain, which connects to It's A Small World. Suddenly You are traveling inside a tidal wave when you are launched through all space and time (think of the scene in the movie Contact where Jodie Foster is flying through that wormhole at lightspeed).<br /><br />Okay maybe that explanation is a little hard to grasp, but you get the idea. This album is a rollercoaster ride in sound. And if it really was some kind of ride, you'd probably go insane from riding it.<br /><br />This is beauty and chaos in one. Massive, ominous, and crushingly powerful. Haunting, creepy, hallow, and echoing in your mind. Beautiful, serene, and flowing, like warm water.<br /><br />Up and Down, climax and release. This is one of those albums you listen to at full volume with top of the line headphones in the dark. With no distractions you hear every layer, every quirk, every nuance.<br /><br /> The \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" of the 21st century.
B00078XGRO|5.0|This goes beyond the fact that the movie itself is a great one. You have a well balanced time travel story along with TNG's own best-bad guy, the Borg. This was the first real 'Next Generation' movie and comparing it to the other flims, all the characters were used wisely and had their moments. The movie's own slate of characters, Cochrane, Lily, the Borg Queen, are all pretty solid as well. This was a flim for fans of Trek as well as those who knew nothing about Star Trek.<br /><br />Now, what makes this particular DVD so great? The extras. I haven't been that impressed with extra features in the past. I thought the candid moments on \\"Generations CE\\" was pretty good. This was beyond good, it was close to shocking how much details and how many great features went into this release.<br /><br />Commentary by director-actor Jonathan Frakes: Frakes' commentary didn't really impress me too much. It was nice to hear his opinion and how he was best fit for the job. It said a lot about the films; having a director who knows the actors and knows Star Trek. If you thought \\"Nemesis\\" and it's director, Baird, were off, the commentary made by Frakes and others really lets you know what went wrong.<br /><br />Commentary by screenwriters Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore: This was one of my favorite parts. I liked their comments on \\"Generations\\" but thought this really sold the film. They went on about how the story was developed, including the earlier First Contact script that didn't work. They also made comments about how this movie went on to influence \\"Star Trek: Voyager\\" and \\"Enterprise\\" and made connections between this story and the entire story on how \\"Star Trek\\" came around.<br /><br />Text commentary by Michael Okuda and Denise Okuda<br /><br />Jerry Goldsmith: A Tribute: This was definately fitting for this release. Goldsmith's \\"First Contact\\" score is great and those involved talk about how Goldsmith was able to use the music to create an entirely new level to the story. It also reaches beyond Trek and talks about his influence on other flims.<br /><br />The Legacy of Zefram Cochrane: This was fun. The Cochrane of the Original Series and this film are different. The writers and producers talk about why that is and the actor who played Cochrane steps in and talks about his role here and how he returned to play Cochrane in the \\"Enterprise\\" episode \\"Broken Bow.\\"<br /><br />First Contact: The Possibilities: I found this to be a little boring and odd. It deals with SETI and groups interested in E.T. life in our own solar system. The actor that plays Cochrane talks about his own speculations and work within this area.<br /><br />Unimatrix One: Contains clips from not only the film but \\"Next Generation\\" and \\"Voyager.\\" The actors (Frakes, Burton, Sirtis, McFadden) all give their opinion of the Borg. This feature was great because it took the time to show the evolution of the Borg from their first appearance to their last in \\"Endgame.\\" Lots of \\"Voyager\\" clips and even some commentary on how they've been watered down. It's nice because we get to hear speculations of who the Borg were before their latest incarnation. There is also a part devoted to the \\"Borg babe\\" as she's called by Braga, Seven of Nine.<br /><br />The Queen: Alice Krige takes the time to talk about how she developed the character. She's interesting to listen to but a bit repetitive after some point. She talks about her appearance in \\"Endgame\\" as well.<br /><br />Design Matrix: Basically, how the Borg were developed and their movie makeover. Includes the actual body pieces as well as ships and vessels.<br /><br />The Story: Talks about the development of the story and the producers and writers work on defining what the movie was and what it means outside the fact that it's perhaps the best of the \\"Next Generation\\" films.<br /><br />The Missile Silo: At first, boring, but it goes into the search that went on for a missle silo in the U.S. that they could film in. Talks aboutmissle silos and their purpose during the Cold War. Very historical and interesting. Also, they reveal some secrets behind the silo scenes in the movie.<br /><br />The Deflector Dish: I'm not sure why this was included but it simply talks about the deflector dish scene and how the design of the dish came about.<br /><br />From \\"A\\" to \\"E\\": I thought perhaps this would talk about the creation of the new Enterprise but it doesn't. It's sort of a brief look at all the ships and some design points.<br /><br />The Art of First Contact: Here, the design and concept of the new Enterprise-E is covered in detail.

0743454529|5.0|I picked up My Sister's Keeper and started reading it four days ago, and I just finished reading it earlier today. That is an amazing feat for me, since I usually get bored with some books, and just toss them aside for a rainy day. But there was just no way I could put this book down. I read the synopsis on the back of the book, and it sounded interesting. Add that to the fact that someone recently told me it was great, and I was pretty sure I would like it. I was right.<br /><br />Right away, I was drawn into the world of the Fitzgeralds, beginning with Anna - a 13-year-old girl who all her life has been a donor for her older sister Kate, who was diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia when she was only two years old. Anna was conceived with the sole purpose of giving Kate another chance at life - a decision that was made by her parents and never questioned by Anna...until now. Kate has miraculously lived to the age of 16, but now she needs a kidney transplant in order to survive, and Anna is the only one who can supply it. The only problem is that Anna has decided she no longer wants to be a donor for her older sister, so she hires the help of lawyer to get her medically emancipated from her parents. In other words, she wants to be able to make her own decisions regarding her own body.<br /><br />What follows is an intriguing story that will surely leave you debating with yourself. Jodi Picoult writes her characters in such a way that you can sympathize with all of them, and it is virtually impossible to take sides. At first, I was sort of wary of the book's format: each chapter is narrated by a different character. One chapter it's Anna, another chapter it's her firefighter father, her rebellious older brother, or her  mother (who narrates in the past), or even her guardian ad litem or lawyer. Usually when I read a book, I either want it to be written in the first person by one character, or in third person, where the writer covers many different characters. So of course, I wasn't sure I would appreciate this particular format. And I also thought I would want to skip the chapters narrated by the lawyer and the guardian, which I didn't end up doing; they actually ended up being pretty interesting, and the lawyer especially is an interesting character (as is his dog, Judge). Actually, the reason why this format worked with this book is because ALL of the characters are interesting.<br /><br />My Sister's Keeper is a quick read which surprisingly, given the depressing plot, isn't all that heavy. Picoult weaves a very interesting tale, without getting overly dramatic or sappy (and believe me, this book could have been WAY too sappy if it had wanted to be). She also has obviously done a lot of research and it shows.<br /><br />Granted, this book is not fine literature, and I agree with some people about not liking the ending too much (there certainly were other ways she could have ended it; according to an interview in the back of the book, even her 12-year-old son was mad at her for the ending she chose). However, the rest of the book more than made up for that. This was my first time out with a Jodi Picoult book, but I have to say it just might not be my last.course, I wasn't sure I would appreciate this particular format.

B0007OASII|4.0|Without comparing this record to the previous Kamelot albums, I'll say that this one is very well done, the production is good, the guitars and vocals are mixed in nicely, and this album seems kind of \\"artistic\\" to me, which is a very good thing. I enjoyed it all the way through and I'm sure you will too. <br /> <br />Dice <br /> <br />P.S. Do yourself a favor and check out the latest record by Edguy called \\"Hellfire Club\\". It will blow you AWAY.
B00007KWHN|5.0|1970 found Yes with a new, multitalented guitarist in Steve Howe, and a new sound as Yes jumped feet-first into the then-hot progressive rock style.<br /><br />The Yes Album catches the band at a crucial turning point from a sort of baroque/psychedelic pop group into a band that would soon become the very definition of prog rock.  Keyboard player Tony Kaye would be replaced on the next album by Rick Wakeman, but 4/5ths of the \\"classic\\" lineup was already in place and the prog stylings only hinted at on the earlier lp's exploded for the first time into the classic Yes sound.<br /><br />Every track on this record with the exception of \\"A Venture\\" has been a staple of classic rock radio for decades, even Howe's solo turn \\"Clap.\\"  Even though many songs get over-played, I find that The Yes Album still holds up as a tremendously solid record that never gets boring from the moment the band explodes into \\"Yours is no Disgrace\\" to the closing \\"Perpetual Change.\\"  This is in my opinion Yes's second best record ever after Close to the Edge, with Relayer a close third.<br /><br />What makes this record stand out from the other Yes classics is the palpable sense of raw energy and excitement pouring out of the band as they explored what was at the time a new and endlessly explorable form of music.  The jaded virtuosos to come could never have recorded those joyous close harmonies on \\"All Good People\\" or \\"Perpetual Change\\" quite so joyously.  All these years later, when I think of the classic Yes sound, it's not \\"Roundabout\\" or something, it's those \\"and there you are...\\" choruses on \\"Perpetual Change.\\"<br /><br />Tony Kaye was an unfairly forgotten man once Wakeman came aboard, but his work is very effective and his \\"rockier\\" style (compared to Wakeman's \\"classical\\" style) actually fit these songs perfectly. Jon Anderson's singing has never been better, and his lyrics not as obtuse as they would soon become.  Chris Squire was busy reinventing the possibilities for the bass guitar with his mighty Rickenbacker.  My all-time favourite drummer Mr Bill Bruford was in his Yes hey-day, and Steve Howe's staggering abilities were the icing on the cake.<br /><br />Close listeners and musicians can actually pick out some guitar parts that were edited in later, probably due to Howe's recent joining.  It sounds to this musician's ears that the source of Howe's infamously trebly tone in spots is due to parts recorded late in the recording process at the wrong levels and edited in.  I'm no audiophile but even casual listeners will notice a lot of details like that in this remastering.  The \\"bonus tracks\\" are pretty useless but guitarists and Howe fanatics will love the expanded version of \\"Clap\\" with a bit of what later became \\"Mood for a Day\\" included.<br /><br />As a music lover and a prog fan I give this 5 stars and a hefty recommendation.My all-time favourite drummer Mr Bill Bruford was in his Yes hey-day, and Steve Howe's staggering abilities were the icing on the cake.

B00005JKTF|4.0|This certainly is a beautiful movie to look at, sumptuous photography, a beautiful score, so what went wrong with it?  Director Gillian Armstrong (MRS. SOFFEL, LITTLE WOMEN, MY BRILLIANT CAREER) suffuses it with so much atmosphere, she didn't realize her plot became too far-fetched and squandered the considerable talents of her cast.  Cate Blanchett, recently awarded an Oscar for playing Katherine Hepburn in THE AVIATOR, glows in the title role.  Cate was born to play heroines from the forties, with her high cheekbones, dreamy eyes and gorgeous hair; and as an actress of considerable merit, she makes the best of a character we never fully understand or know.  How can she fall so helplessly in love with a one night fling?  Granted, Rupert Perry Jones is a fine looking lad, but Cate's character appears to be too intelligent to invest so much of herself in such an unfulfilled relationship.  From there on, the script bounces her around so much, we never fully understand exactly what her role in France is.  And why worry with her knowledge of French when everyone in France either speaks English or German?  Even Julien's father (played wonderfully by Michael Gambon) has a flawless British accent.  Credit Billy Crudup for doing so good in his sketchy role as the Communist French underground hero.  The film seems incredibly long, but it's not truly boring; it just doesn't impact us the way I think Armstrong wanted it to.  But any movie with Cate Blanchett is worth seeing just to see this glorious actress do her best, even when she isn't given a lot to work with.
6301640659|3.0|Gay characters began to reach the American screen in the 1960s, but they would not be portrayed with any validity until the 1980s.  Curiously, one of the most homophobic films created by Hollywood would mark the transition: the 1980 William Friedkin CRUISING starring Al Pacino, Paul Sorvino, and Karen Allen.<br /><br />Based on the novel of the same name, CRUISING might best be described as a sexual thriller.  Police officer Steve Burns (Al Pacino) is sent undercover into the gay community to attract and identify a serial killer who stalks New York City S&M bars, slashing and sometimes dismembering his victims with a serrated knife.  But even as the killer strikes again and again, Burns becomes more and more entangled in this extremely dark world, comes to identify with the killer, and eventually self-destructs in a particularly nightmarish way.<br /><br />From an artistic standpoint, CRUISING has several things going for it.  Director Friedkin has an interesting eye, and the film has an unexpectedly gritty, at times almost documentary-like style.  It also has tremendous atmosphere; it is adept at making the viewer feel unsettled.  The cast is also effective in heightening the disturbing tone of the film as a whole.  What the film does not have is a coherent plot, nor does it have anything approaching a decent script, and it is grotesquely insulting to the gay community in several ways.<br /><br />CRUISING equates homosexuality with an extreme sexual lifestyle, and what emerges is a portrait of \\"nasty men doing nasty things in nasty bars.\\"  Does such a subculture exist in the gay community?  Of course it does, just as it does in the heterosexual community--but CRUISING posits this as the norm for homosexuals.  Even more distastefully, what ultimately emerges is the idea that a heterosexual man can be seduced into the gay community in which (at least according to the film) extreme sex, insanity, and violent death all go hand in hand.  And it was precisely this that so outraged many in the gay community when the film was made.  Film shoots were repeatedly disrupted by protests, and director Friedkin tried to calm the matter by stating that CRUISING was not \\"about\\" homosexuals--an extremely bizarre statement that only fueled community ire.<br /><br />A number of gay organizations greeted the film with boycotts, but as it happened their efforts were unnecessary.  Few critics and even fewer moviegoers liked the film and it soon faded from view.  Seen today it reads very much like a snapshot of American homophobia in 1980 and little more.  But CRUISING does have a certain historical significance: by and large it would be the last major Hollywood film to present the entire gay community in a wholly negative light.<br /><br />The very outrageousness of the film seemed to prompt American film makers to a much needed reevaluation of the way in which gay characters were portrayed on screen.  Although \\"gay man equals bad man\\" characters have cropped up in a few films since--Kevin Costner's NO WAY OUT and several of Mel Gibson's films come to mind--the overall reaction to CRUISING killed the stereotype.  And so the film, in an accidental sort of way, is significant from a historical standpoint; film historians and movie buffs will find it interesting, and I give it three stars for their sake.  But just about everyone else should leave it alone.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Revieweray community when the film was made.

B000001EUR|4.0|This is a good album and perhaps their major breakthrough album that got the band into a worldwide spin.  <br />Songs like Bad Boys Running Wild, Rock you like a hurricane, I'm leaving you, Holiday that helped Love At First Sting became a multiplatinum selling album with 6 million copies worldwide. It also reached double platinum status in the states.  <br /> <br />At this stage they could sellout arenas anywhere in the world becoming 1 of the most successful bands to come out of Germany if not they are the most successful band to ever come out of Germany. <br /> <br />Keep rockin!
B00078XKDE|4.0|There is something unmistakeably compelling about The Kills. VV & Hotel have a palpable chemistry on-stage that translates beautifully in the studio. There's this raw, urgent, detached energy to their sound that digs right into the soul of Garage Rock. VV's voice is clear and sensuous and Hotel has this sort of hoarse sexy whisper that compliments her perfectly.  <br /> <br />The fact that they choose to use a drum machine may feel incongruous to some rockers out there. I know it did to me at first. Yet as I've kept coming back to their stuff, I realize that it's part of their 'mystique' and definitely, for me, since there's no one else to compete with, makes this duo even hotter on stage. <br /> <br />\\"Keep On Your Meanside\\" will forever be embedded in my mind and heart, but \\"No Wow\\" will keep me going until I can see them live again!
B000001EUP|5.0|This is by far their best selling album. This is also the album that got them some recognition in the U.S by going platinum. If I'm not correct the song No One Like You went to no.1 on the singles chart in the U.S. <br /> <br />This is certainly better than their breakthrough album Love at first sting and all the other releases they have made. Nothing can top this album.  <br /> <br />And to the Scorpions fans, there's no one like you!
B0001XAPY2|5.0|Of the films by Hayao Miyazaki I have viewed thus far (keep in mind that I have yet to see HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE), PORCO ROSSO is my least favorite.  Alternately known as THE CRIMSON PIG, this gorgeously animated yet oddly themed tale about a tormented pilot transformed into a pig was the highest grossing movie of its year (1992).  But I didn't find PORCO ROSSO as captivating as Miyazaki's other films; perhaps because I've been spoiled by the adventurous spirit and imagination of NAUSICAA, CASTLE IN THE SKY, and PRINCESS MONONOKE, the whimsy and charm of KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE and MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO and the surrealness of SPIRITED AWAY.  The film eschews all these to tell a story geared more toward grown-ups than children.<br /><br />With the exception of one mystified moment of imagination (a flashback sequence involving fallen airplanes ascending to a streaming trail of vapor--Airplane Heaven, perhaps?), the overall movie is more rooted in reality.  When concentrating on character development and breathtaking flight sequences in the sky, PORCO ROSSO is at its best.  But occasional shifts in the plot feel more obtrusive than interesting, and consequently, I didn't find this movie as memorable as Miyazaki's other work.  By the time the credits rolled, I was of two minds--this was a pretty, well, strange movie, but still good... it just didn't click with me as much.  (Though I still give the movie my highest recommendation.)<br /><br />That said, I now have a huge amount of respect for PORCO ROSSO. And I owe it, mainly, to this two-disc DVD set by Disney.  The visual transfer is crisp, clean and vibrant, showcasing the beautiful skies and oceans when our hero is in flight.  The audio quality on the English, Japanese, and French language tracks is Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround, which is a little disappointing for a film of this caliber, but understandable given the age. Purists will be happy to know that the Japanese language track is included, as well as the French language dub featuring Jean Reno as the title character. (I was told that Miyazaki prefers this version to the original.)<br /><br />But what about the new Disney produced English dub? Well, I do admit to being skeptical about Michael Keaton as the pig-headed (pun-intended) protagonist. Not that I have anything against the actor or any sort of loyalty to the original Japanese seiyuu or Jean Reno, it's just that I had a vision on how Porco Rosso should sound, and Keaton was not it. After sitting through this dub, however, I lay my case to rest--Michael Keaton is an excellent Porco Rosso. His dry, deadpan delivery works in favor of the character's melancholy, cynical nature; but he's not afraid to let loose on the scenes where he's emotional either.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is equally well matched. Susan Egan plays the thrice widowed bar singer Gina with the same amount of sarcasm and vulnerability she gave Lin in SPIRITED AWAY. She also has a great singing voice--for continuity's sake, Disney had Egan redub Gina's siren song, and boy, is it beautiful. Cary Elwes turns in a gallantly boastful and hilarious performance as Porco's rival pilot, Donald Curtis, whose sole weakness is falling for every woman he sets eyes upon. (He also speaks with a surprisingly convincing Southern accent.) Deep-voiced Brad Garrett voices the ringleader of a macho band of seaside pirates with the kind of pomposity and heavy-weightiness you would expect, but also remembers to showcase the character's secretly softhearted nature. Although the banter between his pirate gang isn't as memorable as, say, Phil Hartman's Jiji from KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE, or even the guys who played the Dola Pirate Gang from CASTLE IN THE SKY, the chemistry between this bunch of thugs is undeniably funny. David Ogden Stiers hams it up as Grandpa Piccolo, employing a thick Italian accent, which actually makes his character all the more amusing.<br /><br />It is probably daring to say that in every Disney/Miyazakidub, there is always one actor standing out from all the others, practically stealing the show. In KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE, it was Hartman; in PRINCESS MONONOKE, Keith David; in SPIRITED AWAY, Suzanne Pleshette; in CASTLE IN THE SKY, Mark Hamill tied with Cloris Leachman; in NAUSICAA, Patrick Stewart. So, yes, there is one such standout in this dub of PORCO ROSSO, and this time it's in the form of Kimberly Williams-Paisley. She does an absolutely bang-up job as the spunky, irrepressible engineer, Fio, who befriends (and becomes smitten with) Porco, and the chemistry between her and Keaton is a delight.<br /><br />As with KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE and CASTLE IN THE SKY, the script occasionally makes a habit of reinterpreting and/or altering lines for either comprehensibility, or for the sake of a good joke. Writers Cindy Davis Hewitt and Donald H. Hewitt never overstep their boundaries, though, and remember to retain all the important lines, just like the aforementioned two dubs did (which were both scripted by John Semper, incidentally). All in all, I ended up enjoying the dub more than I thought; it really made the movie a lot better for me IMHO.<br /><br />Additional features include a Behind-the-Microphone featurette (which I always like watching; it's a thrill to see the actors at work!), Japanese trailers and TV spots, and the second disc devoted to storyboards. One noteworthy extra is a 3-minute interview with producer Toshio Suzuki. A longtime colleague of Miyazaki, Suzuki shares his wisdom about this gifted, imaginative animator, and it's a pleasure to hear him talk about this film's assets.<br /><br />Disney continues their first-rate treatment of Miyazaki's titles with this nicely put together package of what is probably his oddest movie yet.  I may not consider this my favorite of the works Miyazaki has done, but you're inclined to disagree.  Besides, Miyazaki at his least is still highly recommended; you could definitely do a whole lot worse by missing out on a less memorable but still fabulous film.ing out from all the others, practically stealing the show.

B000001FN8|4.0|The person below me speaks the truth about the Scorpions. This album kicked so much ass. Mainstream?? They have always been mainstream right from the start so I dunno what people are talking about when they say this album is mainstream. <br /> <br />The 1st 3 tracks are probably the best tracks on the album.  <br />Don't Stop at the top is the best song and very inspiring song that motivates you for more success.  <br /> <br />Rythm of love is another fantastic song so is passion rules the game.  <br /> <br />There are 1 track I didn't really like which was Media Overkill
B0001Z363W|4.0|More of the mellower side of Zakk. It does have it's heavier spots, but for the most part it's simply good ol' rock & roll. A good collection of sitting around outside drinking beer on a warm summers day tunes.<br /><br />Zakk's the man!
B000001FYZ|5.0|This album goes a bit longer than their previous albums with more tracks I think.  <br />With the close of the 80s and the new dawn of the 90s the Scorpions kicked off the decade with a strong release. It certainly is a bit different from their previous albums perhaps the guitar work on the previous albums are abit stronger. <br /> <br />Anyways with the beautiful political ballad Wind Of Change it certainly help this album become 1 of the biggest selling albums in the bands career.  <br /> <br />I think the years the band had taken off was not a good idea as we could've seen more stronger albums than just 3 in the 80s(Blackout, Love at first sting, Savage amusement). <br /> <br />Real pity that this would be their last successful album.  <br />
B0007DAZW8|5.0|Sonicaly this album clearly has a soul. If you want the same old album as you heard before than don't bother, but if you appciate an artist strecting and pushing you to the limits of their borders, (if there are any in this case) then you must order this album!
B0002OERI0|5.0|Sister 1: I was not prepared for such an awesome display of punk and coolness.  I have always considered myself to be a POP tart, but since I first heard Green Day, it was love at first sight.  Although, I could definitely stand leaving out the profanity, they have enough talent to overcome it.   If you can be constitutional and ignore the jabs at the US government, it is surely worth your while, money, and attention.  They are a creative, fun, rockin', one of my favorite, classic band.  <br /> <br />Sister 2: I totally agree with Sister 1.  Every word she spoke was so true, Sista! At first \\"American IDIOT\\" seemed a little insulting to my country and dumb, but when I heard it was awesomly, radically, Grammy materical! (thank goodness it won!) It could have avoided the swearing, but otherwise they will a band to remember.  Enjoy! :- )
B00005JNQQ|5.0|Don't listen to the lame people saying they thought it was too noisy, or stupid. Personally, I hate how on Amazon, adults, complain how much they despise kid movies. Folks, they're for kids. You're opinion doesn't matter and shouldn't be taken into consideration. This movie is amazing. I am 16, and still considered a kid in most standards, and I thought it was simply mind-boggling. It was funny, heartfelt, and exhilerating. This is the story of Rodney, an inventor, who leaves his beloved parents to go to Robot City to pursue his dreams. There he befriends a delightful cast of miscreants and discovered he must save the greatest robot of all, Big Weld, to save his father and their world. Ewan McGregor and Robin Williams were wonderful as were all the other voice actors. This movie has you laughing every other second. This is the most imaginative movie I've seen in a long while. If you want to inspire your kids to hold onto their dreams and be creative, then this is the movie for you. Believe me, you won't regret spending $7 to spend 90 minutes with Rodney, Fender, and the crew. It's worth every penny.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|Sister 1: I'm very happy that Alicia was recently at the Grammys! She definitely has more than enough talent.  This CD was not completely her cream of the crop, she has a lot more potential, but I still very much enjoyed it.  I am mainly in awe that she wrote all her songs, played the piano, and ACTUALLY sang her songs. She is very, very talented.  But back to the cream of the crop, I think she could have given a little more.  I would fo show reccomend this, never the less, for someone looking for an all around semi-great CD. <br /> <br />Sister 2: I agree with Sister 1, but I didn't think (I am one of those obsessed with good lyrics) that her lyrics were to DIE for. Although, I was entertained by the beat and the melody.  She is really brave to make a CD with songs that she, herself, made.  Her creativity surely shines and this CD is one that everyone should add to their collection.
B000001LKY|4.0|Musicnauts:  <br /> <br />Dave Brock: Guitars, Synth, Vocals  <br />Lemmy: Bass, Vocals <br />Simon King and Allan Powell: Drums and Percussion <br />Nik Turner: Saxes and Flutes <br />Robert Calvert: Vocals, Recitation <br />Simon House: Keyboards, Mellotron, Violin  <br />Del Detmar: Synths  <br />Michael Moorcock: Words  <br /> <br />Climb aboard folks, the good ship Hawkwind blasts off on yet it's most overtly proggy voyage, continuing the direction it started on the previous \\"Hall of the Mountain Grill\\".  <br /> <br />All the things that have made Hawkwind so endearing are contained here, the echo-laden over-the-top sci-fi poetry, disembodied flutes and saxes, slashing rhythm guitar, fuzzy insistent bass, chattering electronics, sweeping synths and swirling mellotron with a touch of violin.  <br /> <br />The Highpoints: The killer opening cut \\"Assault and Battery/Golden Void with its insistent double drumming, fuzzy bass and swirling maelstrom of mellotrons and synths, organized chaos at its finest! \\"The Demented King\\" is a fine change of pace, similar in tone to Hawkwind's first more acoustic-folky album. The over-the-top sci-fi poetry of \\"The Wizard Blew His Horn\\" and \\"Warriors\\" complete with pounding kettle drums, cymbals and more of those \\"chattering electronics\\". \\"Spiral Galaxy NGC-28948\\" is a cool little instrumental romp in 6/8, very untypical of Hawkwind. There is also a very entertaining rocker \\"Kings of Speed\\", peppered with, of all things, Simon House doing some mean COUNTRY FIDDLING!!!?????  <br /> <br />The Space Debris: \\"Opa-Loca\\" is a jam that really doesn't go anywhere. My only other pet peeves come on the production and mixing end. A little less echo would've been good on the poems, too much echo makes words unintelligible. The other thing being that Baron Brock got buried in the mix, that metallic slashing rhythm guitar, so much a part of the Hawk's sound is only sporadically audible in spots.  <br /> <br />But pet peeves aside, I found this to be one very fun ride through space with our veteran Hawksters! This would also be the last album for bassist Lemmy (busted at the Canadian border for drugs and then fired from the band to boot). To this day, some folks blast Hawkwind albums when crossing the Canadian border in honor of the Lemster!  <br /> <br />Climb aboard folks, space is the place!!!!  <br />
B000002A3T|5.0|this album is a very good and a must for a floyd fan. I am glad they finally got past the wall era and started sounded great again. The album reminds you of floyds music style from the 70s but with a new 90s sound.
0596007124|5.0|I think it's safe to say that this is the first design patters book I've read that hasn't immediately put me to sleep.  Don't get me wrong, I absolutely believe in the concept of design patterns.  It's just that most of the books that talk about them are so unbelievably dull, that it's hard to not to fall asleep.  This book does an amazing job of discussing design patterns, but managed to talk about it in a way that actually made me want to continue reading. <br /> <br />The book starts off with probably the best explanation I have read about the difference between inheritance and interfaces, and why to use one over the other.  The book proceeds to discuss such patterns as the Factory pattern, Singleton, the Command pattern, the Decorator pattern, the Observer pattern, and the Adaptor pattern to name a few.   <br /> <br />Be warned, this book may not be for everyone.  For example, if you're looking for a pattern reference book, you might want to avoid this one.  If you're looking for a good tutorial so that you can learn patterns for the first time, then this is probably the book you want.  Please also note that all examples are provided in Java, but it should be fairly straightforward to translate most of these into your target language. <br /> <br />The workbook style of this book as well as the informal writing make this an excellent book to use to learn what patterns are, how to use them, and why you should even care.  I would  highly recommend this book to someone falling into this category. <br />
B00023BLXK|3.0|The dancing was good but they could have had more of it.  The love story was barely warm.  Romanticizing a failed revolution which continues to commit human rights violations against it's own people is really sad, even for a fantasy film.  Batista was bad but Castro has been way worse.  THE ENDING WAS TOTALLY DISHONEST IN A HISTORICAL SENSE, AS CASTRO'S REVOLUTION HAS DONE NOTHING BUT ENSLAVE, KILL & TORTURE THE CUBAN PEOPLE.  If you can set aside the dishonesty & illogical romanticizing of the failed revolution, the film is just ok.  The original Dirty Dancing was WAY BETTER.
B0001CCXGG|5.0|first off vai can play pretty much anything malmsteen can vai recently recorded his first all classical cd with a 100 piece orchestra and critics are saying its composed much better than malmsteens classical cd he just doesnt choose to ruin a song by adding speeds scales were they dont fit when vai comes out playing a 3 neck guitar in the middle of the song he starts to show a little of his amazing sweeps and scales and his scales sound much cleaner than malmsteens when malmsteen comes out he acts like your typical 80s rock poser doing all kinds of dorky things like swinging his guitar behind his back yes he plays some amazing stuff but i agree with other reviewers who say his picking seems to have gotten sloppier lately and he seems to do the same scale over and over now i read hes now a big time drunk and thats why hes obeese and its beginning to ruin his guitar skills well i think that might be true also it doesnt help he has horrible tone in this concert because he chose to have a ton of older marshall stacks cranked up with delay maybe its time malmsteen gets a tsl head and stop trying to play metal on a 70s amp
B000002UB3|5.0|After listening to Abbey Road for a few times to write this review I'm marveled about how I never get tired of these songs... I've long given up on the music of my generation but the Beatles are always good no matter how many time you play them. <br /> <br />Makes me wonder why the music of the 60s is so much more appealing to me then the music of today... and it's easy to decipher because musicians payed more time in creating great albums back then versus a lot of artist of today usually having one or two good songs and throwing in a lot of other songs around it, calling it an album. <br /> <br />Abbey Road has to be my all time favorite album from the Beatles. <br /> <br />I love everything about it from the subtle touches of the Moog synthesizer... to John's guitar riffs that range from furious to weeping... from the playful lyrics like in \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" that makes murder sound fun (i love when Paul laughs in middle of this song when he says \\"writing 50 times i wont be ohhh sooo\\"... to John's biting lyrics in \\"Come Together\\" <br /> <br />i also love the way that each song seems to contradict the next one... one song brings you to one place emotionally and the next drops you to a new level... it seems that the album it self is battling between good and evil... with both side coming up as the winner... example is \\"Oh! Darling\\" leading into \\"Octopus's Garden\\" <br /> <br />and then there is my favorite song off this album \\"I Want You(She's So Heavy)\\" where John grips about the love that he's lost... god, the way he wails makes me think of ever girl that I've ever lusted after <br /> <br />to cap it off the end of the album becomes a mini opera where one song leads into another in perfect precision... which ends with the greatest lyrics <br /> <br />\\"And in the end, the love you take <br />is equal to, the love you make\\" <br /> <br />what a perfect album! <br /> <br />in short Abbey Road is nothing less then a masterpiece...
B00005JM02|5.0|This movie rules.  My 14 month old son and I sit down and watch a little every day.  He loves the colors.  I am not an Ellen DeGeneres fan and she does an excellent job.  I would say this is Pixar's best film but I am going to have to save that for my review of The Incredibles. <br /> <br />I would like it if Pixar had a mode for younger kids.  I would love to turn off some of the scarier scenes (the beginning, the shark scene and the fish at the bottom of the sea with the light on his head).  I would pay extra for this mode.  My son loves all of the Pixar movies but each of them has a scene or two that is too intense for the youngins. <br /> <br />Are you still reading this?  Go buy this movie now! <br />
B00005JKNF|3.0|This appears to be a \\"love it or hate it\\" film, so I feel odd to be right in the middle here.  While some reviewers seem to have expected a murder mystery, I approached this film with no expectations whatsoever beyond its reputation as a critically acclaimed film.  What I got was a mostly well-executed Robert Altman film, with all his idiosyncracies, and what I ended up with was too much of a good thing.  As for the mystery, the film is over halfway complete before it happens, as there's too much setup and character development; this is generally a good thing but only if the characters are really interesting.  Altman's most memorable work (\\"M*A*S*H,\\" \\"Nashville,\\" \\"Popeye,\\" and even \\"The Player\\") has far more interesting and well-defined characters than \\"Gosford Park,\\" which is a serious flaw.    It's another huge ensemble cast piece, my favorite performance (easily) being that of grand old Dame Maggie Smith, looking every one of her 66 years and then some.  God bless her for not having tons of \\"work done,\\" unlike so many plastic-faced plastic people in showbiz.  A well-deserved Oscar nomination for best supporting actress for Madame Smith, as well as for Helen Mirren.  As is typical of Altman's work, this huge cast mingles and interacts well, hard to see which bits are ad libs and which are plot points because they all tend to build in the direction needed to carry the story; some lovely and memorable moments, such as the maids dancing outside the party to the music being played inside for the upper crust.    For all of Altman's style and well-deserved reputation, I had a hard time sticking out this overly long drama.  For one thing, I'm mystified that the word \\"comedy\\" is attached to this film in any respect; I found no humor other than the idiot police inspector, the most moronic such character since Clouseau; while Peter Sellers was funny, however, here the character is just a nuisance, a one-line joke gone on too long.  It's also a problem with all Altman filmsthat his method makes the dialogue very, very hard to follow, and often hard to even hear; sure, I'm all for the realism of overlapping dialogue, but the helter-skelter method of hiding mikes and cameras to catch actors ad libbing, in order to splice together a story later, results in too much off-mike echo of voices, rustling of costumes, etc., hard to hear what's going on.  I always feel like I'm missing something when watching an Altman film, and that's irritating because his films are generally interesting; this one certainly is.    Credit where credit is due; the story takes some unexpected turns and has a pip of an ending.  I just would've liked to have a program so I could tell the players one from the other, and a transcript in the other hand to see what was being said much of the time.  I think I have better ways to spend future 2-1/2 hour chunks of my life.
0684833395|5.0|In order to find out how complicated this book is, you must first read it. However, after having read it and having struggled through many parts of the book, you find the book not very complicated anymore. <br /> <br />Since many reviews have been written about the plot and characters of this marvelous book, I will proceed to write my feelings after reading it. <br /> <br />Heller has done a great job of writing a book that basically satirizes World War II. This book is very complex, with its many plot twists and flashbacks, but not complex enough that readers will lose control of the main picture he is trying to paint. Readers young and old alike will be awed by the cruelty of the last world war while laughing through many other parts of the book. The amazing range of emotions regarding the book is what truly makes it a masterpiece. <br /> <br />However, I must warn that readers will not be able to comprehend the full comical effect of the \\"profoundness\\" of this book very easily, as it requires a much higher level of reading than most other popular books.
B0000399WI|5.0|I've watched this more times than I remember, but I do remember that I decided in 1997; I wouldn't bother to buy a DVD plyer until this came out...  I bought a copy 3 months later.  Stephen King did an excellent job as always.  check out \\"Different Seasons: A Novelette\\" with 4 stories.  Three were made into films, including \\"Stand By Me\\".
0671027344|5.0|The Perks Of Being A Wallflower <br /> <br /> <br />The Perks Of Being A Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky is about a teenage boy called Charlie who has to deal <br />with psychological problems, and in the course of time collects experiences with girls and drugs which finally <br />lead to the root of his problems. <br />One outstanding point of the book is the developing of the secret about aunt Helen, who was Charlie's closest <br />relative. Another well created aspect is the communication and relation between the different characters like <br />for example the tolerant, even accepting treatment of the gay Patrick. <br />It is a book which is worth reading, the author manages to keep the suspense at a high point by his way of <br />writing and detailed describing of the plot.
B000008LOV|5.0|Regardless of anything else, the Traveling Wilbury's line up of George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, Roy Orbison & Jeff Lynne made the group a major musical landmark. And, unlike most similarly \\"stellar\\" combinations, this one really worked. With no name checks and no individual writing credits anywhere in sight they clearly meant business in integrating themselves into a genuine \\"group\\" structure, and it shows because they play & sing as a tight, wholly complementary unit. But above all, what makes their first album so good is the sheer quality of its songs. With only a couple of exceptions they lay down an excellent set of \\"good time\\" rock music that really does bring out the best in the huge array of talent on offer, including the superb \\"Handle with Care\\", \\"End of the Line\\" & \\"Not Alone Anymore\\".     Unique, brilliant and in the end short-lived, \\"Volume 1\\" is their only recording that includes Roy Orbison's wonderful vocals. Find it, buy it and revel in one the best albums of the 1980's.
B0007PAMEM|5.0|What's odd about this is that I've at times in the past thought it would be awesome to combine diferent song performances from diferent tours to make a sort of \\"mega\\"-concert of her all-time best.It's so awesome, then, that I wasn't the only one to have this thought. The fact that the songs performed are from tours and shows 20 or more years apart is unimportant and irrelevant due to her amazing agelessness and energy. This set perfectly shows her unique staying power, energy, beauty, and protection against time. Tina's live shows have long been the stuff of rock legend, and this disc shows why. All these performances are wonderful, with fantastic sound and picture clarity. As a MAJOR Tina fan, I'm always thrilled to see new Tina material surface, and even though I have most all the shows in whole represented here in part, it still makes me happy to watch this disc, as a tribute to a very special lady.
0156027321|5.0|Life of Pi is a beautiful, intelligent, engaging, and wise book.  The plot is very improbable - so improbable that Martel points this out in the book itself, also reminding the reader that it is not impossible.    When Pi's family moves to Canada, they take most of the zoo that they own with them.  The ship sinks, and Pi is trapped on a lifeboat with a wounded zebra, a hyena, and a tiger.    Hardly anything actually happens within the first few chapters - Pi reminisces about his childhood in India and explains how he came to be a Muslim, a Christian, and a Hindu. Even at this point, I was drawn in by Pi's voice.  He is an extremely interesting and knowledgeable character.    I cannot tell you how descriptive and informative Pi is about animal behaviour, human nature, and faith.  He is not preachy in the least, merely observant.  The main point of Pi's tale seemed to me that a world with God is \\"the better story.\\"  The idea of a world without God is so horrible and desolate that Pi insists on believing in God.    I loved this book wholeheartedly.  It is very thoughtful with spots of hilarity.  Please read it.
B0006IIPIK|3.0|THX1138 is the apartment numbers seen on a glass window of a door in the film, notice the Star Wars connection there, remember the awful Aliens Vs Predator, and realize that fanboy motion picture films are really not what we want to see... ever. With that said and done the art value of Sky Captain is quite high, although certainly not the near perfect CGI as we have seen many years ago in a similar teenage movie \\"Final Fantasy\\", which did it better, but the story was not really there either, whereas Sky Captain has live action actors in with the CGI, doesn't really end up doing that much for it in the end considering that the best thing in this offering is the sexy/funny/action heroine character that Angelina Jolie plays for the ten minutes she is in it and not the dumb blond character of Gwyneth Paltrow actually playing a dumb blond and obviously hating every second of it because Jude Law gets to blame absolutely everything on her (he should have loved it a little more maybe), Episode 1 has certainly much better background composite effects work, plus animations, Sky Captain never breaking the airplane special effects that Pearl Harbor had, EP1 though had an even better story, so that will tell you what kind of audience this End of Summer 2004 Sci-fi was catering for.<br /><br />By all the means, this is a great movie for young kids because there is no elements of strong violence, except for very light comedy violence towards the end and is devoid of bad language meaning anyone can watch it, and so for that reason should be not be trashed for being at least a glamorous looking Saturday Cinema morning candy stall sell-out that is probably actually worth their dollars this time but if you are older then maybe consider watching all the originals that this one tries to pay homage too first (everything from Jurassic Park to The Day the Earth Stood Still). I maybe still get a better kick out of watching black and white Flash Gordon episodes to give this anything more than a solid three stars. Fun if you like Flash though, but I think this one could have been better.than a solid three stars. Fun if you like Flash though, but I think this one could have been better.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|The movie is not based on people cutting off their limbs with a saw like everyone thinks.  There is only one subtle saw/limb scene.  The acting between the two guys in the bathroom was pretty cheesy, but other than that, I liked it so much I watched it twice!  I haven't seen a good psychological movie like this since The Silence of the Lambs!!
B0007NFL18|1.0|This album is less signifigant than a hair on my left nut.  Am I the only one that notices that 50 doesn't even try?  It seems like all his verses are all one word.  And I'm no fan of anyone he disses, they suck too.  Except Nas, Nas is 50 times the rapper 50 could ever be.  But do you fools realize that there is good music that Isn't played on the radio.  Geezus.  Gangsta rap sucks, these fools aint gangstas.  Get with the underground.
0156027321|5.0|This is the book I had been looking to read for a long time... and I am glad a friend pointed it out to me.  I had read THE ALCHEMIST and then THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN hoping for such a read.  FIVE PEOPLE was close - but Martel's handling of the truths we know and the lives we live through the story of PI was a perfect fit.<br /><br />A sinking ship... a tiny life boat... a boy and a large cat.  The exploration of cage and confines, isolation and companionship, preservation of freedoms and organized religion rocked gently on the ocean with Pi and Richard Parker.<br /><br />Pi is a clear storyteller - his language investigating his thoughts carefully.  His words and actions described fully - but nothing is ever overdone.  Every sense of a leaping over of oblivion, social order, and fear versus danger are explored in the long ordeal of Pi at sea with the tiger.<br /><br />At the end of the book - specifically the re-telling of the story - I was reminded not so much of God, but of the strength of human nature [or that of any living thing] - and its potential to surprise.
B000089RVX|5.0|Its a great CD. Amy's voice is heavenly - although, if you are expecting songs like Bring Me Back To Life, you'll be disappointed. Her other songs are just her vocals, no duets like the single. Still, its a good buy if you like Amy's ethereal sound over the guitar riffs.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|As soon as I popped-in the first disk and saw the overhead shot of Wembly I was transported back to 1985 as I was glued to my tv to watch \\"Live Aid\\" on MTV. <br />Being a huge 80's music fan, this disk is a treasure chest of some of the best music from that era. Given the age of the recording, I was impressed with the sound quality and video. The angles were great and gave you a true sense of what it was like to be there. There was such a great diversity of music back then. From rock to pop to metal to new wave and more, this DVD gives you a taste of what 80's music was all about. <br />I agree that the US crowd was a bit more subdued, but how can you get pumped-up over the Beach Boys and Hall and Oates? Where were the US mega-bands? Aerosmith, Journey, Kiss? Van Halen would have blown the roof off of JFK (if it had one). This disk just underscores the fact the the 80's were the most diverse, upbeat and musically enjoyable years of the 20th century.  <br />Long live the 80's!!!!!
044024157X|4.0|After reading bestsellers such as Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, I expected every single book on the bestseller list to be just plain fantastic. I knew John Grisham was an acclaimed author and knowing that his work included Runaway Jury (I saw the movie), I was eager to read one of his expansive novels. <br /> <br />I walked into the book store (Waldenbooks) and immediatly went to his (fiction) part of the store where I saw an array of 400 something page books with the same font by Grisham. I was eager to read his latest (The Broker) but it was in hardcover and I did not have that type of money, so I went for the next one, The Last Juror. <br /> <br />I must say that the \\"synopsis\\" and image on the front cover are EXTREMELY misleading. It said that Willie Traynor (the main character) was \\"thrust\\" into the center of the scandel (the murder). The book did not turn out that way it all really. I began reading that book on a Monday and by Wednesday, I was one fourth the way there, completely absorbed in the courtroom drama. After what seemed to be the climax, the book begans to come back to normal and talk about life in Ford County, MS. <br /> <br />Although it deals with controversial topics of the time like desegregation, death penalties, rape, murder, narcotics (marijauna use), and religion, it still has time to teach us about the true meaning of life with exotic characters as Calia Ruffin (an Italian speaking African American) and Lucien Wilbanks (a despised cussin' lawyer). I enjoyed the fiestiness of the main character, Willie Traynor as the fearless leader for free speech. <br /> <br />I have a conflicting sense when I think of this book. I was disappointed about how they claimed it was \\"thriller\\" and how the pace was rather slow. I enjoyed it because of the time period (1970s, a rather unused one) with actual historical events occuring in the background like the reaction to the Vietnam War, the integration of schools (black/white), and revival of a religious time. <br /> <br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has some spare time and time to waste and who enjoys a heartwarming feeling at the end. Do I regret spending $8.64 (7.99+tax) on it? Sort of, I just wish I got it half off like how I felt shortcomed by the deceiving \\"summary\\" on the back but no doubt, I did like it.
B00005LQ04|5.0|Long Live Dario Argento! Suspiria is able to pinion you into a level of creepiness not easily repeated by other horror movies. Nor has it been sucessfully duplicated to this day. Though \\"The Exorcist\\" is my all-time terror trigger, \\"Suspiria\\" rates a close second in seat squirming. Could it be the subtle recipe of neon reds, and violets that illuminate the blatantly gory focal points? Could it be the waxing and waning caterwauling music of Goblins that bring an otherwordly feel into this stylish horror extravaganza? I don't know.<br /><br />But what I do know is that from the moment you start watching Suzy Banyon arrive at the ballet school of gore, that you are simply riveted. In the events that follow, you are put off center by a parade of deaths so grisly and beautiful David LaChappelle couldn't have framed it better-if he tried. This work of art could have only been done by Argento. Personally speaking, the ceiling scene is spectacular and is as equally gruesome as the basement scene in Argento's \\"House by the Cemetery\\".<br /><br />Suspiria is clearly a DVD \\"MUST HAVE\\" in any true horror collection.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|This is one of the most original ideas of seen in any movie recently. A killer who teaches his victims the value of life through his sick and deadly games. I was intrigued with the ways the \\"Jigsaw Killer\\" was killing his victims. The ending surprised me greatly. My only complaint is that there's a lot of dialogue but though all that to see the violent scenes makes it worth your while.
B00008973Q|5.0|Kurosawa's great retelling of the King Lear play, with three sons vying for the father's riches rather than three daughters. Two of the sons cowtail to the father's bidding, seeing only their rich inheritance; the third ridicules his father, calling him mad and telling him that what he is doing will only divide their kingdom up and have the brothers fighting each other for it. The father banishes him. Of course that is exactly what happens and not even the banished son, who returns to try to put things right, can save the kingdom. By film's end all have been killed and the castle's in flames. Kurosawa is a master craftsman, and the battle scenes are stunningly photographed with the camera remaining stationary and, other than music, no sound. Perhaps at 3 hours it's a bit long, but it's never boring. Marvelous.
B0006IUDXA|3.0|I fully agreew with other reviewers, the show is just great. I never saw it before I bought it as I like RDA in Stargate SG-1 so when I saw that the 1st season was out I bought it. Being from Switzerland I particularly like the always clever use of the ever present Swiss Army Knife. But I must say that the DVD quality is REALLY disappointing. The image is quite grainy and the sound is also not up to par with modern technology. No extras, no subtitles (maybe there is closed captions but european TVs do not have the decoder) no extra languages no nada. Come on Paramount you can do better than this and hope you do for next seasons.
B00005LQ04|2.0|This is one of the most overrated \\"horror\\" films you'll ever see. I, too, was swayed to check it out after hearing about its \\"legendary\\" status as one of the greatest ever made. It's just not true. It's unintentionally hilarious in many scenes. About the only positive comments I can offer are for the effective use of extreme color and an interesting soundtrack. Otherwise - a waste of time. Watch \\"Dead Alive\\", instead.
B00005JNPZ|5.0|This is the best romantic comady that i really enjoyed and i hope that girls from all ages learn to be open minded and give a chance for every cool guy that cant express himself infront girls  - this film best part for me is when they say it loud and clear that men are not all the same and that men try their best to get the girl that they like and the girls should give 'em a chance and take their time to know the guy ..
B00005JNEW|5.0|I live in a small town in PA. We have a football team at our high school that is quite terrible--our cheerleading squad had better seasons than the football team did.    So, of course, my school doesn't support its football team the way Permian supports the Panthers. My parents got me this film for my 20th birthday, as I love sports movies. I wasn't sure what to expect--I had a good feeling about this movie, though. I popped it in and was merrily talking to my best friend and my cousin online. However, shortly after beginning this movie, I became idle in my typing and completely engrossed.    This film is tied with Miracle for my favorite movie. From beginning to end, it will grasp your attention and make you feel like you are part of the rugged, oil-based community of Odessa, TX. You will laugh, you will cry, and most importantly--you will learn a sociological lesson about the importance of high school football in Texas.    The special features give you a deeper look into the true story of the 1988 Permian Panthers. The score and soundtrack for the movie are flawless--you will never again think of a Friday night high school football game in the same way.    I highly suggest you read the book as well. The book and the movie offer two very different perspectives on the Permian Panthers and the town itself.    Watch and enjoy!
B00005JNDZ|5.0|Maybe it was more screen time for Colin Firth.  Maybe it was the wonderful \\"fight\\" scene between he and Hugh Grant, but I enjoyed this movie more than the first.  Also, it was more Bridget, less of her friends.  If you're looking for the next literary venture in a movie, this ain't it!  But if you want to laugh, and have a fabulous, feel-good movie, this is it!
B00005JKN9|1.0|This is, if not the worst movie ever made, then probably the worst movie ever to receive a bunch of Academy Award nominations (10!). It's excessively violent and ludicrously overacted throughout. Daniel Day Lewis hams it up shamelessly. Leonardo diCaprio and Cameron Diaz can't even have sex without violence. It would have been a real shame if this atrocity had won Best Picture. Maybe the Academy gave Scorsese all these nominations because they felt guilty for not giving him enough awards for his genuinely outstanding achievements, i.e., Raging Bull and Goodfellas. It's a shame to see really talented people come up with such trash. Scorsese couldn't have done worse if he had collaborated with Oliver Stone on a sequel to Natural Born Killers.
0385504209|4.0|Professor Robert Langdon, on business in Paris, is called to the Louvre Museum late one night, after closing hours. He arrives at the renowned museum and is greeted by police detective, Bezu Fache. Fache shows him the curiously arranged dead body of Jacques Sauni&egrave;re, brutally murdered, former curator of the Louvre. Not long afterwards, Sophie Neveu, French cryptologist, arrives on the scene. She gives Langdon a secret message and shows him a vital clue that the police have ommitted to disclose to Langdon: \\"13-3-2-21-1-1-8-5 O, Draconian devil! Oh, Lame saint! P.S. Find Robert Langdon\\" A clue left behind by the dead man but what does it mean? One thing is for sure and that is Langdon is now chief suspect of the crime. Sophie must help Langdon escape the clutches of the police and unravel a succession of clues leading to the great secret held by the dead Jacques Sauni&egrave;re.<br /><br />Secret societies, cryptic clues, theories challenging the foundation of the Christian Church and the Bible all go into making this a fast paced and fascinating but rather far-fetched read. The Vatican has, as of March 2005, recommended against reading this book which will no doubt add to its notoriety and thus increase sales figures. However, I believe that it is just a piece of harmless fiction, although some devout Christians may find it offensive and/or laughable.<br /><br />Lea Ling Tsang
B00005LC4B|5.0|I just received my \\"10th Anniversary Edition\\" of Cape Fear. <br />Don't be fooled. This is the EXACT same version that was previously released on DVD. I compared it to the original release that I already own. <br /> <br />Nowhere does this edition mention \\"10th anniversary\\", and the extras specified are the same as well. Somebody messed up. If you already own it, skip this supposedly new release (Feb., '05). There's nothing new or different about it. <br /> <br />However, if you've never seen it, or if you are a fan of this film, I would recommend buying Cape Fear. It's an edge of your seat thriller with fine acting by all, and deserves a place in your film library. <br />
B00003ETOW|5.0|I've seen all the versions of \\"Jane Eyre\\" made to date, and this remains my favorite, primarily because George C. Scott is the perfect Rochester (though Scott's biographer, W. A Harbinson, dismissed the film as ordinary).  Both he and Susannah York invest their characters with passion without resorting to histrionics.  The score by John Williams is one of his early efforts before he attained fame, and it remains one of my favorites. <br /> <br />The movie was filmed in Yorkshire, and on its original telecast the beauty of the Yorkshire moors was evident.  Subsequent transfers to VHS and DVD have been atrocious and resulted in a dark, grainy film.  Nevertheless, I return to this again and again for its superior performances.
B000268QB2|4.0|Another fresh musical breeze has blown in across the Atlantic from the British Isles. Keane is a three-piece Brit-pop outfit that to some extent follows in the footsteps of bands like Radiohead, Travis, and Coldplay.  However, while influenced by their predecessors, Keane fashions a gentle yet full-bodied sound that's all their own. This is earnest, sincere pop/rock, delivered without a hint of cynicism. <br /> <br />The uniqueness of Keane's sound results partly from their decision to dispense with guitars completely.   The songs certainly don't suffer from the absence of a guitarist.  Keane's heavy reliance on piano invites comparisons to Coldplay, while their aggressively mellow approach places them in the same vein as Travis.  However, Keane's style is more delicate and pop-oriented than Coldplay's, and their songwriting is less tentative than Travis, who always played their cards too close to the vest for my taste.  Perhaps Keane's greatest asset is the bold simplicity of their approach. Their sincerity allows them to achieve the big chorus or crescendo without sounding blatantly commercial or overly derivative. <br /> <br />Keane delivers soaring ballads, up-tempo pop rock, and smooth midtempo numbers with equal facility.  Upbeat, catchy tunes such as \\"Bend and Break,\\" \\"Everybody's Changing,\\" and \\"Can't Stop Now\\" grab the listener immediately; you'll find it impossible not to sing along after the second or third listen.  Exquisite ballads like \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" and \\"Bed-shaped\\" achieve lofty and romantic heights, avoiding sappiness and sentimentality by a hair's breadth. For variety, Keane slides into a late 70s-style soft rock sound (10cc and Gary Wright come to mind) on the atmospheric numbers \\"Sunshine\\" and \\"Untitled 1.\\"  <br /> <br />Singer Tom Chaplin sings beautifully and passionately in both full voice and falsetto.  Keyboardist Tim Rice-Oxley resists the temptation to fill the guitar hero's role, instead providing solid chordal support with a few tasteful excursions into synth leads.  Drummer Richard Hughes delivers steady rhythms throughout. <br /> <br />Keane aren't as ambitious as some of their contemporaries, and this is not a particularly challenging set of songs.  But that's OK: they aim to please, and they succeed in doing it.  \\"Hopes and Fears\\" is an auspicious debut and one of 2004's most pleasant surprises.
B00028HBKM|3.0|Some say its the greatest story ever told. And I am inclined to believe them. And Mel Gibson takes the final 12 hours of that amazing story, that amazing life, and puts it under a cinematic microscope the likes of which Christians have never known. The Passion is a well made, well directed and well acted film. It is sure to rank among the best ever made in the genre. But it does have its problems. <br />First, I couldn't help but feel that Gibson was leaning too heavily on traditional and/or personal teachings and understandings of certain aspects of this story rather than on the scriptures themselves. He seems to go above and beyond the scriptures in many cases, and not just to preserve a sense of realism or artistic vision. <br />For example, as in many films on the life of Christ, his mother Mary is given a spotlight almost as large as the Lord's. In scripture, Mary certainly is there, but she is never as central to the Gospels as, say, Peter.  <br />Secondly, I have a hard time believing the Romans beat Christ as many times as they did. There is no evidence in the scriptures to suggest that Christ was beat to a higher degree than any other \\"criminal\\" being prepared for crucifixion. This is the scene that I believe that many point to as being over-the-top and violent for violence sake. I can't help but agree. Forty lashes was the usual punishment (I think) and yet we get almost double that here.  <br />Then there is the scene when Jesus is brought before Herod and he asks Jesus to perform a miracle for him. Why is Herod being portrayed as some sort of flamboyant cream puff? Maybe historical documents prove otherwise but in all my studies of the scriptures I have never heard that. <br />Next are the historical inaccuracies. The Romans would have spoken Greek not Latin. Crucifixion was in the wrists not the hands (the hands were not strong enough to hold the body in place).  <br />Other non Biblical scenes include Jesus hanging from chains over a bridge by his Roman tormentors and also being flipped over face down with the cross crushing him against the ground as they secure the nails to the beams. All the while, blood is everywhere, flying, dripping, seeping. <br />As for the package itself, I was really hoping for extras, but you get nothing at all. This was a real disappointment, as I always enjoy those sorts of things with DVDs. <br />On the bright side, however, as was alluded to before, the acting is great, especially the performance of Jim Caviezel as Jesus. Never before has a more believable Christ been committed to film. <br />Don't think that I totally dislike this film. It is a good film. But I think Gibson may have allowed many of his own passions and personal beliefs to color the telling of the story. But ultimately, although powerful and compelling to behold, it falls short of the glory it could have attained, numbing viewers instead of humbling them.
0312995423|4.0|Digital Fortress is like the other Dan Brown books in that it is an adventure.  You are into the characters from the get go.  The story is about an unbreakable computer code and the loveable code breaker named Susan, who works for a government agency.  Now, if you know much about computers and you let that get in the way of the story, you will not enjoy this book.  But, if you put all of that behind you and let the story be just a story, then you will enjoy this book a lot.  I do not think this book is Dan Brown's best work, but it is good for laying on the beach type reading.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Buy this.  Don't open it until you can get to a set of headphones, smoke a joint, and enjoy.  It's the BEST album so far this year and will probably make most top 10 lists in nine months.  Enjoy!!!
B0000A1HQP|5.0|The first time I watched this movie was on a VHS video tape. My wife and me had to stop the movie at least ten times to catch a breath between laughing fits. We did restrain ourselves from throwing the ashtray at the bumbling Ms. Pignon (Jacques Villeret) but I did throw my slippers.<br /><br />Since then I've watched this film about 10 times, and still can only restrain myself with an effort. Thierry Lhermitte as the snob is fantastic. Alexandra Vandernoot, his wife does a great job, and Catherine Frot the girlfriend is really cool in her role.<br /><br />Daniel Prevost, the tax collector who \\"would audit his own mother\\" but is crazy about football (soccer), and Francis Huster (the once slighted friend) who comes back to help play their roles admirably.<br /><br />If you like slapstick, you won't find it here, but if you like your comedy fresh, and intelligent, by all means get this, get some friends, and sit down for a treat, but REMOVE ALL HEAVY OBJECTS FROM THE ROOM
B000059H98|5.0|Okay, I didn't just like this movie, I love, LOVE this movie.  Yes, its campy, yes the plot line is bizarre, No I can't get a guy to watch it with me (but they won't watch Earth Girls are Easy either) but I just love this movies humor and girl power without being GI Jane. <br /> <br />Yeah, the Rippers (aka Kangaroo people) are a little scary, but they are genetically engineered kangaroo mutants who happen to be trying to find their creator.  (I got over the Rippers scariness when Rebecca and Jet were high on helium and then doing that stupid dance.) <br /> <br />I think about this movie when I am down because most of the movie had me laughing my head off.  But I guess this tells you about my personality because this movie isn't for everyone.  Don't watch this movie expecting to learn anything or have a plot to follow.  Just sit back, and enjoy the cartoons...and the fact that one of the main characters is a tank! <br /> <br />While I didn't know this was a comic first, I'm curious to see them now.  But since I generally won't watch a movie if I've read the book, I can understand why the people that read the comic didn't like the film.  To them I have to say I'm sorry, because I still adore this cartoon/movie.  But I will admit that knowing now that this was supposed to be an Australian flick explains a lot...I always thought this had kind of a Mad Max feeling too it. <br /> <br />BTW, it really would have been cool if they had done outtakes etc on this movie, so I do agree there...
B0002IQHY8|5.0|I especially like the Orson Wells and John Cleese soundbytes on this CD. The songs grow on you and holds true to the Alan Parsons feeling that I was attracted to on their debut album back in the seventies. Even if you yearn for music the way it once was this CD has a lot to offer. It's quality of sound is excellent.
B0002V7O3I|5.0|Okay, like most of the other reviewers, I really enjoyed this movie as a kid and was really excited to see it getting released as a DVD.  I've talked about the movie on and off over the years but never met anyone else who remembered it, so I was very excited to finally meet someone who remembered the name. <br /> <br />I have to say, the plot of EXPLORERS was far more in-depth than I actually remembered. ...which was the three kids getting mistaken as aliens while inside the \\"bubble\\" they created and going into outer space.  <br /> <br />I also have to add that both River Phoenix and Ethan Hawke are both geeky looking boys in this movie...as a pre-teenager, how could I have ever thought they were cute??   <br /> <br />This is a light sci-fi that anyone should be able to enjoy.  I wouldn't compare this movie to GREMLINS (that movie scared me to death as a kid), but maybe more along the lines of GALAXY QUEST with Tim Allen -- accept more scientific.  Regardless, this movie is a classic!
B0000027RL|5.0|Ten (1991.), the Pearl Jam's first studio album<br /><br />'Ten' is quite simply a remarkable masterpiece and definitely one of the greatest debut albums out there. I was definitely unsure of what to expect when I bought this album and felt rather sceptical about what the music would be like. Before buying this album I certainly wasn't much of a listener to the alternative grunge rock but I certainly am now after starting to listen to the Pearl Jam. Their music is unbelievable and certainly are THE grunge band to listen to with music and lyrics which are remarkably powerful and thought provoking, plus their music has great firepower and passion and does not leave you feeling depressed (an effect some people assert grunge music can have - I disagree). They are certainly one of the best 90's bands out there and 'Ten' is a great example of that.<br /><br />The Pearl Jam in truth were very much the innovators of grunge metal. Eventhough they only came together as a band in c.1990 and released this debut album a year later, two of the band members, guitarist Stone Gossard and bassist Jeff Ament were originally members of the original grunge band, Green River who were around in the mid-1980's. Certainly the inputs of these two founding fathers plays a big role in Pearl Jam's music. The Pearl Jam deservedly so are a very very successful band and perhaps don't always get the credit they deserve. The fact that they are still together today producing great music well after when grunge was at its prime shows how good they are and are able to move with the times and music scene seamlessly and effectively.<br /><br />'Ten' was a massive success when it was released and it was this album, along with Nirvana's 'Nevermind' which took grunge onto the world stage. The Pearl Jam's early efforts (this one and vs.) are the real heavy works which they put out and they do this in style with this album. There are certainly no filler tracks on this album - all 11 tracks are all powerful in their own way, bashed out with plenty of aggression. The version of 'Ten' which I own myself is a bonus tracks edition. The extras include an excellent live play of 'Alive' and two extras, the slow and thoughful 'Wash' and 'Dirty Frank' a rather amusing and sometimes funky track which makes a good edition - both these tracks are actually available on the 'Lost Dogs' 2003 release but certainly make more than welcome additions to this album. However, the standard edition is by far good enough - afterall, your getting a real classic album!<br /><br />So onto the tracks themselves. On the top of the billing is 'Once' to kick the whole thing off. Don't let the quiet start fool you - this track builds into a real heavy rocker and the first introduction to the strong and sometimes angry lyrics of Eddie Vedder, who, for the record is a brilliant vocalists and deserves real respect - he's up there with the best. 'Even Flow' is a great follow up with a powerful riff bashed out with a strong drum beat. 'Alive' for me is the best track on the album - some great lyrics coupled with some killer guitar solo work from Mike McCready - 'Why Go' the follow up to this is another heavy track with angry lyrics threaded through it. 'Black' and 'Oceans' are both slower and more thoughtful and make an excellent backdrop to the heavy start to the album. 'Jeremy', 'Porch', 'Garden' and 'Deep' are all execellent tracks also and 'Release' the closing track is the kind of song that sticks in your mind chiefly due to its powerful, wailing lyrics.<br /><br />Overall it is a great debut and was the album that got me listening to the Pearl Jam in the first place. This is a great band full stop and I am a big fan of their music. This debut shows signs of the further great music which they later produced which involves a good dose of hard rock coupled with sometimes good experimentation with other genres. DO NOT miss out on listening to the Pearl Jam and certainly do not overlook this masterpiece album.
B0007DAZW8|3.0|(I would give an extra half star for balls if half stars were an option.  So I'll do it here - 3.5 stars)    I read somewhere that Thomas Bangalter and Guy Manuel De Homem Christo chose their group's name from a quip in an English article reviewing their style of simple funky house music.  And so \\"Daft Punk\\" was born.  Leave it to these guys for their third album to buck conventions even further by creating an admittedly \\"direct\\" album of highly repetitive beats, riffs and densely layered vocoders and guitar licks that, in an odd twist of irony, once you dig through the surface beat-box fuzz is more punk than dance.    Offering so few lyrics (instead they use simple repeating phrases of thickly distorted vocal effects while electronic noises as barely discernable hums, chants, uh-uhs and shout-outs accent as a kind of electronic symbiosis) it's difficult to consider that these artists, who often disguise themselves as robots for press and interviews, are providing serious social commentary. However, the surprisingly sinister \\"The Brainwasher\\" and infectiously catchy \\"Television Rules The Nation,\\" imply subversive underpinnings with thematic consistency. Can you help but consider how mind-numbingly droned we become by continuously tapping into the ever-pervasive media machine?  The title track winding to a near crescendo, repeating ever faster \\"We are human/after all\\" actually seems to yearn for this realization.  Even more interesting is how midway through the next track, \\"The Prime Time Of Your Lives\\", we see this pattern reversed as the track completely winds down to a puttering squeel while still maintaining that sense of urgency.  One wonders if the robot facade is for us or for them.     There are sonically softer moments reflecting a more intimate and gentler side of human nature with the tracks \\"Make Love\\" and \\"Emotion\\". It's these tracks that attempt to anchor the album to it's stated humanism.  This is not so much accomplished as it is implied.  And perhapsthat's the point.  In spite of the album's wry moniker, Daft Punk do very little to ensure that the average human will find this album appealing. Many of the tracks are perhaps a bit too repetitive for their own good.  Fortunately for the deeply enthused, this is offset by the excellent overall production, which helps to keep those impatient trigger fingers from the ever-happy forwarding button.  That's to say, if you like your beats solely for their sonic depth and punch, you're in for a real treat.  And yet, the really good moments, and there are many, are just that, brilliant moments that don't really go anywhere.  Instead they would seem to rely on the theme that runs throughout the entire album promoting humanity.  But it's done in such a dry fashion it's hard to take it seriously, or should for that matter.      Punk historically is rooted in defying convention and providing commentary on the current state of affairs.  Daft Punk wryly embrace these ideals, however subtly and playfully, by enlisting us to open our discerning media eyes and shake our droned-out grooves with this unconventional electro-rocker.

B0006J28KU|5.0|Michael Mann's sprawling cops and robbers epic \\"Heat\\" was recently released in a 10th Anniversary DVD edition. Let's take another look.<br /><br />Neil McCauley (Robert DeNiro) leads an aggressive crew of robbers, including Chris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer), Michael Cheritto (Tom Sizemore) and Danny. These guys are out for big scores and the film opens with them taking down an armored car in downtown Los Angeles. After they gain access, they search for a specific package and then speed away. Arriving at the scene is Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) and his crew, including Sergeant Drucker (Mykleti Williamson), Detective Casals (Wes Studi) and Bosko (Ted Levine). Looking at the detritus, Hanna quickly surmises that it will be a challenge to take down this crew of robbers. He is up to and seems to relish the challenge. So begins this tale of cops and robbers, good and bad, black and white.<br /><br />In the penultimate scene, between Pacino and DeNiro, DeNiro talks about two sides of the coin. Essentially, this is the basis of \\"Heat\\". The story follows these two men, and their support crew, as they play a delicate game of cat and mouse. Pacino, as the cop, represents good, or as good as anyone is in the real world. DeNiro represents bad. Most filmmakers would simply end there, and call it done, and we would probably be happy. Michael Mann, who wrote, directed, and co-produced the film, infuses each with subtle shades of gray.<br /><br />Hanna is on his third marriage. He is so obsessed with catching bad guys that he can't devote the time required to make his marriages work. In fact, in his current marriage, he seems to care more about his step-daughter, Lauren (Natalie Portman, in her second film role, following \\"Leon\\"), a confused young lady. He loves the idea of companionship, but his job is more exhilarating to him and he devotes every waking moment to it. His wife, Justine (Diane Venora), has problems of her own and takes medication to combat these. She isn't prepared to just sit around and wait for the occasional moment of marital bliss.<br /><br />McCauley is a hardened man and his family is basically his crew. He has taken of the role of father for Chris Shiherlis and helps him through his marital and gambling problems. McCauley states that he doesn't like to form attachments. Someone once told him that you have to be prepared to walk away at a moments notice, with no remorse. As we look at McCauley's home, a beautiful modern home overlooking the ocean, we get a sense of this. There is very little in the home. just the basic necessities. This is why Neil is more than a little uncomfortable helping Neil deal with his wife, Charlene (Ashley Judd) and their young son. But he does, because he has become a guiding force in Chris' life.<br /><br />Again, in the hands of any other filmmaker, this would be more than enough character for any film. Again, as the audience, we would probably leave the theater happy. But Mann creates back stories for each of the members of each crew, creating a vibrant story of the way these two teams work.<br /><br />Scenes of each crew out at dinner with their loved ones mirror each other. We watch McCauley and his team enjoying dinner, as McCauley looks on, enjoying the thought of family. This leads him to lower his defenses a little, when he meets Eady (Amy Brennerman), a graphic artist who works at his favorite bookstore. He and Eady begin a relationship, which causes McCauley to experience both joy and self-doubt because he is going against all of his philosophies; he is building an attachment. We see Cheritto with his wife and learn later that she takes care of his finances. We see Danny with his wife and learn of their attachment. We see Chris and Charlene trying to act like grownups and live a real life. As they leave the restaurant, Hanna and his crew are watching them and Hanna learns about each member.<br /><br />Later, Hanna and his crew take their wives out for dancing. During this brief momentof relationship building, Hanna gets a call and races off to a crime scene. Later, he returns to find Justine still at the bar. It becomes apparent that their relationship will end, it's only a matter of time.<br /><br />There are many other characters that appear throughout the film, playing different roles in the story. Jon Voight plays Nate, McCauley's `agent', who helps him find the next big score. William Finchter plays a crooked bond trader, Roger Van Zant. Henry Rollins plays his bodyguard, Hugh Benny. Hank Azaria plays a small time distributor out of Vegas. Kevin Gage plays the pivotal role of Waingro. Dennis Haysbert has a brief, but moving role as an ex-con. In most films, this character would simply appear at the right time and start participating. Early in the film, we have a brief scene setting up his character. Later, another short scene. Finally, his character and Neil have a reunion. This is the type of attention to detail found throughout \\"Heat\\", and the attention to detail that makes the film truly memorable. Every character, no matter how small, has something to do with the story and we learn something about their back-story. This creates an incredibly rich tapestry of good and bad.<br /><br />I first saw \\"Heat\\" at the Village Theater in Westwood. This is my favorite theater because it has a huge screen, great sound and a large auditorium. Going into the film, I knew it was almost three hours long and had a bank robbery/ gun battle scene set in downtown Los Angeles. Watching the film the first time, I will never forget the moment that the music started and DeNiro's McCauley walks into the bank wearing a gray suit. Actually, 'walks' is the wrong word. He saunters in. His character is cool and collected. He does the planning. He knows he can carry it off. What really adds to this scene is the music. A grandchild of the music created for \\"Miami Vice\\", Mann's first television series, it brilliantly evokes both the place (Los Angeles), the time (heavily synthesized beat) and the mood (underneath everything is an element of suspense, with a steady music beat).<br /><br />Watching the film for the first time, I was awestruck by the gun battle. Not because I am a fan of violence. If it plays an integral part of the story, I feel it is necessary. In \\"Heat\\", this scene is very necessary. It drives both teams to the finale. Clearly, it was shot on the streets of LA, with tons of extras and real cars, all of which make it appear very real and life like. Watching this scene at the Village Theater, all of the gunshots ringing throughout in incredible Dolby Digital sound, I felt as though I was actually in the middle. I really felt that this was the climax of the film. In most films, a climax of this sort would have left me feeling very happy. Then, I realized that there was still about 45 minutes of film left. It felt like I received a bonus. How many films can you say that about? That you felt like you were getting more than you deserved.<br /><br />The many times I have seen this film, this scene never fails to thrill me.<br /><br />This is not the only great scene in the film. There are so many, including the penultimate scene between the two stars. At this point in the film, Hanna realizes that McCauley is a difficult person to catch. Frustrated with his marriage, he feels that he has to do something that can bring him some closure. He tracks down McCauley and asks him to have some coffee. They meet on opposite sides of the table and talk about the philosophies of their lives and work. This scene is electric for many reasons. First, it is the first time we get to watch Pacino and DeNiro, on camera, together, ever. Second, they are talking about their philosophies of life, revealing what drives them, and ultimately, the climatic moments of the film.<br /><br />Throughout the film, the action scenes are punctuated with the moments of each characters life. We witness small bits of their lives, getting to know them, making the outcome of all of the action scenes that much more intense. Because we know the characters, good and bad, we care about them more. If someone gets killed, we mourn their loss.<br /><br />Neither of the leads is portrayed as simply good or bad. Hanna is the `hero' of the film, but his character is flawed. He's driven, smart and good at his job. But he is a failure at his marriage. He wants to stop McCauley, but he also seems to admire McCauley at times. Pacino is known for his hamfisted dialogue and in \\"Heat\\" he doesn't disappoint. Certain outbursts seem showy (\\"Give me all ya got!\\" and, \\"Because she's got a great ass!,\\" etc.), but given his character, they seem more acceptable. He is a detective and most of these lines of dialogue happen when he is interrogating people. He is trying to keep the other person off balance. It works. It also keeps the audience off balance. McCauley is the `villain', and his character is certainly dark, but he also has a lot of humanity. Where Pacino's character is loud and brash, DeNiro's is quiet and menacing. He cares about each of the people in his team, especially Chris, taking on a parental role in his life. He also yearns, despite his protestations to the contrary, for a relationship. When this appears in his life, in the form of Eady, he becomes even more conflicted.<br /><br />I can't listen to a commentary track for long, because it detracts from the images I am watching. When I watched this 10th Anniversary DVD for the first time, I wanted to hear a little of Mann's commentary. In it, he talks about all of the research he did into these characters. He visited prisons, has a relationship with a well-known detective from Chicago and this detective once hunted an adversary who was named Neil McCauley. It is really fascinating to listen to Mann talk about the film. He clearly put a lot into the making of this film.<br /><br />In all of Mann's films, the production quality is top notch. In \\"Heat\\", he and his team filmed at various locations in Los Angeles and Southern California, lending an air of authenticity to the film.<br /><br />Many of the scenes are shot at night and lend Southern California a beauty that many who live here don't realize it has. A scene at McCauley's house overlooking the ocean is permeated with dark blue. Mann talks about how the scene was inspired by a painting. Another scene with McCauley and Eady is played against a clear night sky, the lights of Los Angeles twinkling behind them, giving the setting an ethereal dream quality. Each of the scenes has a look that adds to the underlying tone of the scene. The scene between DeNiro and Pacino takes place in a stark restaurant. A confrontation between Chris and Charlene takes place at their pool, outside, at night.<br /><br />The action scenes are also top notch. In the first scene, the armored car robbery, a small touch adds to the authenticity. After they place a directional explosive charge on the door of the armored truck, they set it off. The truck has previously overturned into a Car Salesman's lot. After the explosive is detonated, there is a brief pause and the windows of the surrounding cars blow out. In most films, the windows would blow out simultaneously, as soon as the special effects guys set them off. It seems more real that the impact of the explosion would take a second to cause more damage. In the gun battle, there is a brief shot of an extra, playing a policeman, reaching from behind the car he is using for shelter, to retrieve his gun. It seems like the scene was probably not rehearsed and the extra's actions seem more like what a real cop would do in the same situation.<br /><br />\\"Heat\\" is one of my favorites, it's a fantastic, thrilling film.<br /><br />The 10th Anniversary DVD has some added features that are not available on the previous release. The commentary by Michael Mann during the film is new, and very interesting. On the second disc are a number of well-made mini documentaries aboutthe film. Three of these are tied together to present a more complete picture of the making of the film. They feature interviews with Mann, Pacino, Voight, Judd and other actors, as well as the producers, Mann's Chicago cop friend and others. Curiously, they have included interview bits with DeNiro from 1995. Either he wasn't available or didn't want to be involved. Maybe he was too busy making \\"Hide and Seek\\".<br /><br />There is a very brief documentary with the location scout and one of the associate producers as they revisit the locations used throughout the film. Interesting and fun to watch.<br /><br />The most interesting thing is the inclusion of 11 deleted scenes. One of these is a different take of Pacino's first interrogation at the chop shop. Many of them are very brief snippets that wouldn't add much to the plot. There are a few that stand out. Two involve Tom Sizemore's character. The first would have been part of the opening montage, when each member of McCauley's team is getting the necessary equipment for the armored car holdup. The second shows Cheritto at home with his wife and kids. These scenes aren't groundbreaking, but they would've added to the plot. Another scene is between DeNiro and Voight and would've come late in the film. It adds a little dimension to McCauley's character and the last few minutes of the film.<br /><br />While playing the second disc, my DVD playing had a little problem with the deleted scenes and the longer Making Of documentary. During the deleted scenes, twice it started playing them in a fragmented way, with no sound. This happened once during the documentary. I solved this by opening and closing the DVD tray. As soon as the DVD was playing again, they played fine.<br /><br />Despite these few technical errors, which may be due to my DVD player, I highly recommend this film to everyone. There is so much going on, and it all makes sense, that you are sure to be entertained every time you watch the film.g the outcome of all of the action scenes that much more intense. Because we know the characters, good and bad, we care about them more. If someone gets killed, we mourn their loss.<br /><br />Neither of the leads is portrayed as simply good or bad. Hanna is the `hero' of the film, but his character is flawed. He's driven, smart and good at his job. But he is a failure at his marriage. He wants to stop McCauley, but he also seems to admire McCauley at times. Pacino is known for his hamfisted dialogue and in \\"Heat\\" he doesn't disappoint. Certain outbursts seem showy (\\"Give me all ya got!\\" and, \\"Because she's got a great ass!,\\" etc.), but given his character, they seem more acceptable. He is a detective and most of these lines of dialogue happen when he is interrogating people. He is trying to keep the other person off balance. It works. It also keeps the audience off balance. McCauley is the `villain', and his character is certainly dark, but he also has a lot of humanity. Where Pacino's character is loud and brash, DeNiro's is quiet and menacing. He cares about each of the people in his team, especially Chris, taking on a parental role in his life. He also yearns, despite his protestations to the contrary, for a relationship. When this appears in his life, in the form of Eady, he becomes even more conflicted.<br /><br />I can't listen to a commentary track for long, because it detracts from the images I am watching. When I watched this 10th Anniversary DVD for the first time, I wanted to hear a little of Mann's commentary. In it, he talks about all of the research he did into these characters. He visited prisons, has a relationship with a well-known detective from Chicago and this detective once hunted an adversary who was named Neil McCauley. It is really fascinating to listen to Mann talk about the film. He clearly put a lot into the making of this film.<br /><br />In all of Mann's films, the production quality is top notch. In \\"Heat\\", he and his team filmed at various locations in Los Angeles and Southern California, lending an air of authenticity to the film.<br /><br />Many of the scenes are shot at night and lend Southern California a beauty that many who live here don't realize it has. A scene at McCauley's house overlooking the ocean is permeated with dark blue. Mann talks about how the scene was inspired by a painting. Another scene with McCauley and Eady is played against a clear night sky, the lights of Los Angeles twinkling behind them, giving the setting an ethereal dream quality. Each of the scenes has a look that adds to the underlying tone of the scene. The scene between DeNiro and Pacino takes place in a stark restaurant. A confrontation between Chris and Charlene takes place at their pool, outside, at night.<br /><br />The action scenes are also top notch. In the first scene, the armored car robbery, a small touch adds to the authenticity. After they place a directional explosive charge on the door of the armored truck, they set it off. The truck has previously overturned into a Car Salesman's lot. After the explosive is detonated, there is a brief pause and the windows of the surrounding cars blow out. In most films, the windows would blow out simultaneously, as soon as the special effects guys set them off. It seems more real that the impact of the explosion would take a second to cause more damage. In the gun battle, there is a brief shot of an extra, playing a policeman, reaching from behind the car he is using for shelter, to retrieve his gun. It seems like the scene was probably not rehearsed and the extra's actions seem more like what a real cop would do in the same situation.<br /><br />\\"Heat\\" is one of my favorites, it's a fantastic, thrilling film.<br /><br />The 10th Anniversary DVD has some added features that are not available on the previous release. The commentary by Michael Mann during the film is new, and very interesting. On the second disc are a number of well-made mini documentaries aboutthe film. Three of these are tied together to present a more complete picture of the making of the film. They feature interviews with Mann, Pacino, Voight, Judd and other actors, as well as the producers, Mann's Chicago cop friend and others. Curiously, they have included interview bits with DeNiro from 1995. Either he wasn't available or didn't want to be involved. Maybe he was too busy making \\"Hide and Seek\\".<br /><br />There is a very brief documentary with the location scout and one of the associate producers as they revisit the locations used throughout the film.

B000002JBG|5.0|I absolutely loved the movie, and when I saw this CD at a garage sale, I went crazy and bought it!! I didn't care who was singing what. 'Neways, I've always loved upbeat songs, no matter the material, it gets my rythem going, so one of my fav songs from this track is Space Jam. The song is pretty cheer-lead-y, but it's really good. You cannot tell me you don't like Bugs Bunny and the crew, they've made me laugh and in the movie, there were some really funny moments, so, that obviously brought me to my favourite song on this track--Buggin' It's pretty funny and cool at the same time. Rap fans obviously take Hit'em High as their favourite, and even if you're not a rap fan, you'll love this song. Most soundtracks feature famous singers that sing songs that have no relation whatsoever with the movie, but this soundtrack have lots of songs, the 3 songs i've mentioned above, Basketball Jones, all the songs with the word 'fly' in it.(I Believe I can Fly), and even if they don't have anything to do with the movie, it'll still get you in the mood... <br /> <br />Overall, it's the most awsomest Soundtrack CD Ever!!!
B0002858YS|5.0|This CD has everything, great lyrics, vocals, and instrumentation. I was suprised at how good the guitar player is. He's not playing lame stuff like other modern rock bands do, it's actually quite interesting and intricate. Even though the lead singer is from Las Vegas, and sings with a British accent, he can still pull it off very well. He does some pretty cool effects on his voice too, like in Mr. Brightside. This is definately a CD worth buying... <br /> <br />Here are the top 3 best songs on the album- <br />*Mr. Brightside- whoever's felt jealous before can really relate to this song. It's amazing! <br />*Smile Like You Mean It- this song shows the originality with their synth, it's very clever, and awesome sounding. <br />*Jenny Was a Friend of Mine- Awesome bass riff, reminds me of an 80's rock song. Spectacular!
B0006IIPIK|2.0|The visual imaages are remarkable.  In fact, they are what is good about the movie.  If viewed for that, it is worth seeing.<br /><br />The story was a major disapointment.  Depite good acting, it was impossible to care about the charaters.  I think this was because the story line drags too much and just seems to be a compendium of  too movie references: for example, the robots were transmogrifications of Gort, Robbie and the Iron Giant but with a bad attitude.  Running around inside the mountain with the rocketship was reminicent of Indiana Jones and James Bond; the splash down sequence was pure Bond. A good idea got out of control. There is actualy a decided absence of new ideas and creativity in this regard. That's understandable for first time directors but the producers have been around long enough to know better and should have exercise more control.<br /><br />The DVD includes the 6 minute short that was the basis of the project.It is actually much better than the film itself.  Had they continued with that and been held to 90 minutes the results could have been impressive.  Also in the special fetures section someone says they were trying for a \\"noire\\" look -- and in that may lie another big problems.  It had that look, alright, but there was nothing \\"noire\\" about the characters or the story line.  No moral ambiguity about motivations, no sense of emptiness at the end.<br /><br />I hope they get to try again but next time with the help of simeone who can spin a good tight tale and who understands that the visual style must be linked to the stopry and characters.
0316172324|4.0|If you're an expert in the field(s) (or fancy yourself one - God knows there are a lot of you nowadays) discussed in this book, then, yes, I agree, you should stay away from it. I highly doubt that Blink says anything you aren't already an expert on (or fancy yourself an expert on) - there is a difference, btw. <br /> <br />However, if you've never really considered, in any thoughtful or considered way, about the power of the gut feel, then I highly recommend this book.  <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, this book is by no means the be all or end all on the topic. That having been said, it's a great (and easily readable) starting point from which to begin a systematic exploration of the topic, and for a title such as this (i.e. one that aims for a broader audience) that's all you can reasonably (or have a right to) expect. <br /> <br />You want dense science and pages and pages of discussion concerning hypothesis, methodology and findings, read Scientific American or Nature. Leave us ordinary folks who're just looking for a basic appreciation of the topic alone and get off your scientific high horse danm it! <br />
B000002OX7|5.0|This is The Who at their best (studio-wise).  Every song is 'classic' (gee, I'm hating that word).  Every song is a masterpiece in and of itself (there...that's better).  Songs of love, misery, rebellion, and strength; this one runs the whole course of rock music and runs it better than most others.  For those who are just discovering rock music in its purest form, try this one out and then, try out The Who 'Live at Leeds' as a follow-up to this one.
B000003N89|5.0|This is, without a doubt, one of the best albums I have ever heard.  As good as the entire package sits - from the foldout wrapping to the wonderful easily accessible program notes to the sultry black and white silhouette inside - nothing compares to the music.  And this music astounds in variety, depth and most of all, the sophistication and sheer quality of the recording. The band is superb, Krall, Keller, Malone (and Benny Green in \\"If I Had You\\").   <br /> <br /> <br />What could be more satisfying than the lyrica \\"I'm no Errand Girl for Rhythm\\" that carries a sultriness and breathiness that others only hope for.  The \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\", a slow incredibly beautiful ballade, captures the essense of the entire set.  The vocal trio on \\"Hit That Jive Jack\\" reminds one of the Manhatten Transfer. The gems continue to roll forth - the sensuous piano duet and lyrics of \\"You're Lookin At Me\\", the piano (and voice) of \\"Deed I Do\\" and last, but certainly not least, the quintessential show ending, \\"If I Had You\\".
B0000BWVCM|5.0|With the success of the first X-Men, and the Spider-Man movie, it was only a matter of time before a sequel was made.  <br /> <br />In a spectacular action sequence that opens the movie, the President is attacked and threatened by a mutant.  Professor Xavier sends is Senior pupils to track him down. When they do, they find that there is something very wrong about the whole situation.  Soon after, the school is attacked and the mutants get split up and venture across the country.  Magento, still imprisoned in a plastic cell, finds a way to escape and join up with Xavier's group.   <br /> <br />Everyone returns from the first movie and some other mutants from the long running comic series are introduced.  Colossus crashes into the story line, but is all too quickly shoved aside, a shame considering his popularity in the comic.  A young but brash Pyro comes on the scene with an obvious pre-disposition of becoming evil.  But the most impressive is Nightcrawler, played with complete bravada and emotion by Alan Cumming.  Brian Cox plays William Stryker, the Government scientist bent on destroying the mutants through his resources in the military.  He plays a bad guy so well you love to hate him.   <br /> <br />The story and characters are solid and riveting.  All returning actors play their roles with comfort and stride.  All are given plenty to do.  Along the way story lines weave in and out of one another.  The attraction between Jean Grey and Logan heats up, as well as with Rogue and Bobby (Iceman).  Storm and Nightcrawler form an obvious bond as she reassures him that he can belong in society while he sparks her desire to have faith in God. <br /> <br />The action scenes are fantastic and brutal in some places, especially with Wolverine in full fighting mode, he doesn't care if he kills anyone.  The movie works it's way into a tragic ending that leaves the story open for another chapter, one that fans of the comic are well aware of and are most likely hoping will be continued. <br />
006092988X|5.0|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is the type of novel that comes along once in a lifetime.  The reader is swept into the life of Frances Nolan, aka \\"Francie,\\" and is an unseen observer in the life young Francie leads.  Francie and her family are poor.  Poor to the point where it is a simple wonder that they have enough money to exist.  There is a knowledge of this poverty in the characters, and a wish to be better, however they have no means by which to overcome it.  Instead they embrace their lives and hope for better times.  Francie values small things which may be overlooked in our world today, such as a pickle, jello, and even shiny pennies.  She is grateful for what she has in life, though she is deeply poor and is well aware that others look down upon her.  <br /> <br />The title, \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is symbolic in its meaning, and has many layers by which to discover.  The characters come to life in the beautifully written prose of author Betty Smith.   <br /> <br />Time passes through the life and eyes of Francie, and as she grows, so does her perception of the world and those around her.  She grows up fast, and at 14 is older and wiser in years than her Mother.  Her relationships are heartfelt, as are her desires to overcome her life of poverty.  Though poor, she is not ashamed and her pride is felt in waves throughout the novel.  Throughout her journey, she remains true to herself and to her family. <br /> <br />Personally, I was moved by this novel.  It is an excellent read.  My perception is that it started out somewhat slowly, but soon gathered speed as characters were developed and the story unfolded.  I recommend this to all who want to experience a rich, beautifully written and deeply moving novel.
B0007DAZW8|2.0|I didn't think that I could be disappointed by Daft Punk. Over three years in the making, and this is their worst album to date. \\"Homework\\" blew my mind, \\"Discovery\\" took it to a whole new level, but this album, \\"Human After All\\", is so disappointing it's hard for me to believe that Daft Punk made it. <br /> <br />Discovery was my favorite album, it took you up and down sonically, fostered different moods in every song, and gave sharp and crisp rhythm. Even the talk-box vocals were excellent, they themselves had a rhythm that fit into the music like jigsaw. <br /> <br />Human After All, their latest installment, lacks the novelty and melodic engineering that Discovery had. It consists of the same DP sound samples we have been accustomed to, except now they are mashed together and then spewed repetitively as the record drones on. <br /> <br />This is not a record. This sounds more like a sample CD that DP uses to cut and mix their REAL music. Whatever sounds can be perceived as mood, melody, or simply just \\"music\\" is lost after hearing the same clip repeated over and over for five minutes straight until you have forgotten your own name. <br /> <br />I regret this album. I wish they could unmake it and give me something new. I do however, have faith that they can follow up with something much better. I'll check back with them in three more years.
B0007GAEW6|1.0|this is probably the worst album ever. \\"like anyone could even know that...\\" well perhaps i'm being a tad liberal with the term \\"worst ever\\" but this is pretty pathetic. you guys must be smoking on that bubblegum and that sour disel, because this sounds absolutely retarded. its like a bunch of at-risk children got ahold of \\"Close To The Edge,\\" smoked some paint chips and chunks of dried airplane glue, picked up a SAT vocab study guide, had a circle jerk and upon cumming simultaneously had the epiphany to make the most pretentious, bloated album in recent years. if its rockin' your ears are cryin' for, check out The Futureheads, Death From Above 1979, Converge, etc. and if you are into the \\"weirdness\\" factor, try something less forced...e.g. Captain Beefheart.
B000005GYI|5.0|This is both the high point and the beginning of the end of a long friendship (as beautifully told in the book Sonhos nao Envelhecem, available only in portuguese :-( ) <br /> <br />The Clube da Esquina was a loosely bound group of friends from Belo Horizonte, a city located in the middle of the Brazilian territory, in the Minas Gerais state, far away from the sea. They got together in the 70s to play music, drink beer and talk about the Beatles, a band they loved. <br /> <br />Milton was the obvious star in the group but all of them were immensely talented and had a lot to contribute as is clear in their solo work (Lo Borges albums are masterpieces if you are able to overlook his vocal flaws and Beto Guedes is pretty good too). <br /> <br />Notice that by then Milton was not the superstar he became after. This album is signed by both him and Lo Borges. This is still a group effort. <br /> <br />The album has a very free style. It sounds lyrical, obviously Beatles influenced, smooth, gentle, the Brazilian rhythms presented there are not the ones you are used to, a lot comes from their native Minas Gerais state. It is the product of a group of friends having a lot of fun playing together. <br /> <br />The group began to dissolve slowly after this album. Milton got famous, started hanging out with a different crowd, you know how it goes, how all friendships end... <br /> <br />The follow-up to this double LP is another double LP (Clube da Esquina 2) that features major stars of the time, lavish production and has a different beauty to it, maybe it is even more musically relevant than this one. But this is the more sincere and is generally considered the best.  <br /> <br />My personal opinion is that if you like Brazilian music you should have both :-)
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Absofrickinlutely hilarious!<br /><br />The sex scene was the biggest laugh in the film, and the songs are better than the bombastic movie songs they parody.<br /><br />\\"You can show it in a MONTAGE!!\\"<br /><br />When I saw it in the theater on a Friday night, there were only 10 of us there.  That meant that there were only 10 people in town that night with a smart enough sense of humor to \\"get it\\".<br /><br />If this DVD has ANY extra footage, commentaries, or whatever, it will make the DVD a STEAL!  Because the movie \\"as is\\" is MORE than enough reason to buy this DVD.<br /><br />If you are tired of (and disappointed by) the hokiness and silliness of Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer/the-crapmeisters-who-gave-us-\\"Independence-Day\\"-and-\\"Godzilla\\" movies, then TA:WP is the thumb-nosing you wish you could deliver to Hollywood personally.<br /><br />I'm so excited about this DVD getting released that I'm tempted to hibernate until the release date so I don't have to be so giddily anxious for the remaining weeks until then.<br /><br />****(and to reviewer Shuckert who reviewed this film on 03/17/05 and included a note about my review: --  I know Bay and Bruckheimer weren't involved with \\"ID4\\" and \\"Godzilla\\"  - the punctuation was supposed to mean Bay AND Bruckheimer AND the creators of \\"ID4\\" and \\"Godzilla\\", and not imply that they were all on the same team.  Sorry if I failed to be clear on that with the \\"/\\" mark.)****
B0001KZM3O|5.0|This one of my top ten albums of all time, and easily among Floyd's best. I love it, practically knowing it from memory - second by second. And yet, sometimes i just can listen it. Sometimes it's too much. <br /> <br />  First of all, this is pretty much a Waters' solo album. A lot of people compare it to \\"The wall\\", mood wise, and while it shares the war topic, it's much more moody. You won't find long instrumentals or rockers here (besides \\"Not now john\\", sang by Gilmour), and the songs are very simple in structure, yet excellently performed, with very good orchestral arrangements by Michael Kamen here and there. I'd compare most of the album to The wall's \\"Mother\\" or \\"Goodbye blue sky\\", and just like in those, it's very lyrically driven. <br /> <br />  See, you can say whatever you want about Waters' songwriting. But he has a knack for lyrics, and the lyrics is what makes this record work. I'd venture to say these are his best, from both his Floyd compositions or his solo albums. And that's what makes the album so haunting for me - you just can't be moved by what the man has to sing about in this record. It's so visual, so well written that almost feels like a movie sometimes, and it's why it's too much for me sometimes. It's impossible to listen casually, it just captures you, willingly, even when it can be pretty depressing in parts. Of course, i have predilection for a number of songs (\\"The gunners dream\\", \\"The final cut\\", \\"Southampton dock\\", \\"Two suns in the sunset\\"), but it works as a whole in that way - i can count with my toes the number of records that have this effect on me. <br /> <br />  Don't let me bother you any more. Give it a spin once, from the begining, and i'm positive that you'll find something in it for you. It's an excellent record, both seen as a Waters solo album or as a Floyd one, and it's a glaring sucess as an anti-war message. Musically or in any other art form.
0380002930|5.0|This is one of those rare novels where once you read it, you will remember it forever. A simple story made into a timeless classic of literature - about a group of rabbits escaping the destruction of their home, being led by their visionary saviour and searching for a new and promised land. Filled with unforgettable characters, rich narrative - a tale of friendship and love, betrayl and struggle, and just about every aspect a humanity. Richard Adams wrote many excellent novels, but this one is by far his greatest achievement. It's simply one of those books you fall in love with and do not want to end.
B00000IPAX|5.0|I was pretty gutted by the recent \\"indefinate hiatus\\" from Blink 182. They basically sum up all that is fun, punk and having a great time and with 7 albums, they will go down in history. Upon listening to this album, I am definate that this is the best Blink 182 album. It features the fast, punky trashy songs, those that are a little out of tune, or slightly off time. It features those hilarious sketches inbetween tracks, and basically feels like Blink 182 are not particulary serious about producing a perfect album more, trying to produce a fun album, one that will cheer everyone up. It's typical Blink at their old time best, and is a MUST have for Blink 182 or anyone just trying them out. \\"Adam's song\\", a triumph of musical excellence, \\"What's my age again\\" funny punk, enjoyable, all other tracks, just a little disc of fun! Live on Blink!
B00000F2JL|5.0|United Airlines is currently running a commercial campaign using similar-looking animation -- when it dawned on me what those commercials were reminding me of, I had to dig this out. I first got this video via mail-order about 12 years ago, while at sea in an aircraft carrier during Christmas. <br /> <br />The animated story is nice and charming enough, but what really kills me is the theme music. Haunting piano at the opening, and then with lyrics during the snowman's flight -- just the most beautiful music you'll ever hear.
B0000AQVCL|1.0|I can't believe that everyone has not figured out that their hit song has EXACTLY the same guitar riff has the white stripes' song \\"Screwdriver\\" did on their first record. IT'S THE SAME! I feel like I'm taking crazy pills..
B0002KVUKM|2.0|Van Helsing was like watching a 2 hour video game, or maybe it actually was a video game. For those who actually like a story with all those special effects, this movie did not deliver.  <br /> <br />I really wanted to like this movie, but it had no creativity to it. It seems as though the action, fantasy and horror movies have become so dependent on special effects that they actually can try to get by with little else, devoid of a good story or creepy characters. None of these characters were very impressive, and had little in the way of script to get themselves out of their proverbial holes. As one reviewer mentioned, Dracula came across as wimpy and annoying more than anything else. Personally, I didn't care what happened after about an hour and a half of viewing. I just wanted it to end.  <br /> <br />Perhaps a cynical viewpoint to express, but I'm sick of watching a movie and seeing nothing but special effects. This one is not much a movie mainly because it lacks what even the cheesy horror movies of the past had:  personality.  <br /> <br />None here.  <br />
B00005YJMX|4.0|Whose ego is bigger? Klaus Kinski or Werner Herzog...I think it's a tie.  The real surprise (lost within all this ego tripping)is Bruno Ganze--who gives a heartfelt performance as a helpless Jonathan Harker and, let's face it, Isabelle Adjani is one of the most angelic women who ever walked the earth.  Kinski gives another one of his patented performances while Herzog allows the story to slowly (and I mean slowly) unfold.  The final scene, where Harker rides off into a bleak landscape, is unforgettable.  Filled with existentialist dread, \\"Nosferatu\\" leaves the viewer pondering the questions of life, death and love.  Maybe this film falls short of F.W. Murnau's masterpiece but, it is a worthy remake by one of the great filmmakers of the 20th century.
0679720200|4.0|The Stranger Review by Sade McFadden <br /> <br />     When I read books, I must be honest, I look for characters who are exciting,dangerous, or outgoing. Camus' The Stranger, has none of thoes, how ever it was very much of intrest as if it were a book such as Carl Webbers' Baby Mama Drama.  <br />    We have the main character who is just \\"Bland\\".  He cares for notthing, never showing the list bit of emotion.  He's mother dies and does he cry... not at all, but he does want to go to sleep. He's so sleepy...yet after the funeral he goes to the beach, the movies, then to his house where he has sex with an old friend...or is she more than just a friend. <br />    Next there's Raymond, a \\"pimp\\" who wants revenge on his \\"mistress\\", in which he beats the hel out of. Now from there on \\"mr.thoughtless\\" Meursault helps him by writing the letter to lure the mistress. Then he testifies for Raymond to relive Raymond of his charges.Now don't get me wrong, but doesn't it seeem ironic that Raymond never helps out in any of his little attempt to get revenge. He just leaves Meursault to do all the work. Meursault kills the Arab on the beach leading to his fate. Emotionless...no stupid, Meursault ends up on trial when it should have been Raymond. <br />    Oh and lets not forget sorry old Solomon, that has been with his dos so long that now look exactly alike. He shold just get on his hands and knees, bark, and marry his dog. He beats the life out of his dog and mistreats it, but when it leaves he's crying why... um hello. <br />   Now in the end of the book if you have any bit of religion in your soul, your faith might just be tested. So Meursault does not believe in GOD..but wait he does believe in life after death. So he thinks he knows himself so well... then why doesn't he know what he wants. He's right we won't waste our prayers on him...because hell already as a reserved seat wating for him.
B0007GAEW6|3.0|It's hard not to get excited over a band such as Mars Volta.  They have their roots in one of the most progressive bands of the 90's (and one of my favorites), and with a noteworthy debut still getting attention, it's easy to love this album before even hearing it.  Therefore, I'm trying my best to write an accurate account of how I really feel about this album.<br /><br />Right off the bat, I'm loving this album.  The opener \\"Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus\\" is very likable.  They seem to blend the off-beat verses well with the mini-solos and electronic additions.  The vocals are fast-paced and right on key, reminding us what we love about Cedric.  \\"The Widow\\" is next, the single off the album.  I must say it's nothing too impressive.  The lyrics are pretty good but that doesn't save the song from its slow pace and uninspired mood.  The track then trails off into several minutes of disorientated noise.  \\"L'Via L'Viaquez\\" starts off with my attention but soon loses it with the same kind of uninspired sound that I heard in \\"The Widow.\\"  Midway through this song I forget I'm listen to MV and almost try and eject an Enrique Iglesias album.  Some cool guitar solos try and save this song, but overall I'm just not feeling the spanish singing and latin influence; I think it's too off-track from the intended mood of the album.<br /><br />At this point I'm getting a little disappointed, but I have faith and Mars Volta has a way of keeping you on your toes.<br /><br />I'd have to admit that the first time I listened to this album, \\"Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore,\\" the 4th song, kinda scared me.  It begins with a good four minutes of low chorus type singing, creating a pretty creepy vibe.  Other chanting comes in and really starts to build an uneasy tension in the song.  More odd and creepy stuff happens before arriving at the meat of song highlighted by some Radiohead-esque vocals accompaning nearly-western guitars and horns.  If you listen closely at the end of \\"Miranda,\\" you can hear a song playing in the backround.  I've only listened to the album a couple times but it sounds so familiar to me.  I don't think its another MV song but my instincts tells me its a past ATDI song that I just can't put my finger on.  Anyway, Last on the album is the behemoth \\"Cassandra Gemini.\\"  I don't think I've ever heard of a song being ever remotely close to the giant 32+ minutes that this one is.  Frankely this song is a commitment.  Not being all negative, I really like this song.  I think it's more of the MV I was looking for on this album.  In a nutshell:  great vocals, original instrumentals that really defines the word freestyle, and something about it that seems to keep me interested for the whole half-hour.  I thought it would be a bit of a struggle, with the band sometimes using the \\"noise-filler\\" button a little too much, but a sax laid down some very enjoyable freestyle jazz type stuff and it made the whole thing fun (first appearance all album).  I think I would have been happier with this album if it had just been this track.<br /><br />In conclusion, this album made a couple things happen for me.  1) Make me realize how much I like De-Louse better.  2) Finding patience to listen to a 32 minute song, 3) And really appreciate MV as one of the most forward-thinking artists to ever come out of rock and roll, regardless if I didn't care for a balady single and a foreign language inclusion.<br /><br />Way to go Mars Volta don't stop doing what you're doing. (please don't, please...)nd of \\"Miranda,\\" you can hear a song playing in the backround.  I've only listened to the album a couple times but it sounds so familiar to me.

B00070DK5K|5.0|I must say, the album isnt as good as Stage, becuase Stage has a more you know \\"Surreal\\" feeling.  I tihnk David Live would have been better as a dvd, becuase I have heard it is more of a seeign experiacne than listining.   <br /> <br />Still, the live album is a great one and makes up for where certain bands live albums fail miserably.  The album is more of a epic drama starting off with the Post-Apocalyptic \\"1984.\\" Which settles the mood and creates an enviroment that is not Ziggy anymore.  The next following songs are around the same pattern in their Drama motive.  Dont worry, Bowie does older songs like Changes, Watch that Man.  They have a more jazzy and funk influence to it, and with each stage..I am sure he does that to all his older songs.   <br /> <br />The second disk is a little bit more accessible and definitive.  It does have a slower pace and isnt as Apocalyptic than disk one.  It starts off with two covers, but the only flaw really is Knock On Wood..Bowie really doesnt fit into the cover and makes it a little bit broing.  Space Oddity, is a beuatiful song and makes the disk seem like a majestic beauty loged in a psychotic pretense.  This disk also includes Diamond Dogs, Time and The Width of A Cirlce.  The album is very good and makes it seem not really live. <br /> <br />The only things that fans might notice is the different voices for back up singers are mroe gradual.  This is because when shooitng the mikes were messed up or didnt get as much feedback from the singers.   <br /> <br />Either way it is an enjoyable experiance and I highly reccomend it, but if your low on cash I perfer anyone to buy Stage first.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  Taken individually, I can easily see how \\"The Widow\\" might leave you hanging (but even so, what's the song about?), or \\"L'Via L'Viaquez\\" seems a bit repetitive with the main line.  But, when I think of the album as an entire (76+ min.) composition, the effect on me is far greater than that of any individual song.  That is what I've come to appreciate about The Mars Volta.  Artists typically do not compose like this (nowadays), and if they do it is often less grand.  And I think a rating of 4.5 stars would be more appropriate (though not available). <br /> <br />Since this album is one variety of synergism, I prefer to listen to it from beginning to end without stopping.  (Incidentally, that's also my preference for De-Loused.)  While listening, even after the first time, through the journey I lost time; and only after the journey ended did I realize I had been on one at all.   <br /> <br />I have a problem comparing this album with De-loused, if only for the reason that it's simply different music.  The resulting emotions, for me, were wholly different.  And I don't want to take up space analyzing individual song bits: even while listening to it, I enjoy the journey so much more if I simply go for the ride, without trying to be the driver.  Obviously, like many other experiences, one does not know until one does it; and I feel the album accomplishes what it sets out to do.  So I highly recommend it to anyone who has even the slightest interest.   <br />
B000006TRV|5.0|In comparision to every other album released under the name 'Pink Floyd', this has to be the most complex of them all. Though it is the most artistic and complex, that does not necaserily make it the best, musically; Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here are much more hard-hitting, and overall stronger albums. In terms of sound, though, what makes The Wall so distinctive must be it's longevity, and the range of different themes covered in it's words and music. Listening to this album puts me into it the way a movie would while I was watching; little things like the TV in the background of most of the first half of the second disc creates a perfect vibe for me to sink into. Again, though it isn't Floyd's strongest musically, it's definitely the most effective one because of it's longevity, and because of the story held in it's lyrics.    One thing that makes this album so intriguing is the way the lyrics connect, creating a full, complete story with no 'empty spaces' left unfilled. For those interested in an interpretation on every single bit and piece of The Wall, [...]  The story told is perfect in the order that it's in, but it doesn't do the same justice with the music, unfortunately.    There are some weak points in the album, such as 'Bring the Boys Back Home' and 'Don't Leave Me Now' which I feel should've been more improved upon. Also, since this is a more a single work than a collection of songs, it does make it hard to listen to when you don't have an hour and a half to spare.     I know it would be more fitting to call this a 'Roger Waters' album, but without the influence of his bandmembers, it wouldn't have been what it is today. Also, when Waters was holed up in that cabin for the time when he wrote the core material, it wasn't very strong musically, but when he handed it to Bob Ezrin and David Gilmour, they were aware of this after listening and sought to fix it. Not only that, but David Gilmour had input on one of the most important tracks in both the story and the music in the history of Pink Floyd; 'Comfortably Numb' came from a song David Gilmour wrote that was originally supposed to be on one of his solo works, and is now a staple of classic rock with one of the best and most well-known guitar solos in rock's history. David Gilmour also had credits in Young Lust, and Bob Ezrin for The Trial. Though they aren't nearly as important as Comfortably Numb, it did lead them to become more distinctive tracks on the album.    Out of the whole album, my favorite scene has to be the hotel scene in the first half of the second disc. It's the strongest part musically, and a big part in the story. 'Hey You' is the perfect introduction to the second half, and 'Is There Anybody Out There?' creates the perfect setting and vibe for the rest of this portion.     When I listen to this album, everything around me seems to slow down, even if I happen to be doing something else while doing it. I'm in a computer class listening to The Wall as I type this, and though I'm focused on this review, my mind doesn't stray from the music. For this, The Wall definitely ranks among the top Floyd albums for me. I would suggest to buy this, but not before listening to their stronger works such as Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, or Meddle. I actually got this for Christmas of last year (after literally years of saying that I would buy it, but never getting around to it), and even after over three months, I haven't been able to stop listening to it.    This review was actually inspired by a discussion of 'Great Expectations' by Charles Dickens; it intrigued me how everything in the story seemed to be connected, and how every little thing contributes to the meaning and symbology, and this album actually came to mind. Though I don't have much more time, [...]  if your interested in finding the meaning of parts of the album, or maybe even every little bit of it if you want.    Though not their strongest musically, definitely a worthwhile experience, and a definitive point in Pink Floyd's history.
0688170528|4.0|I very recently stumbled across Jodi Picoult's works and I cannot say enough good things about them. \\"The Pact\\" is such a complex and wonderful novel that I am not sure where to begin. Picoult deftly crafts sympathetic characters that steal our hearts. The pain of the two families torn apart by suicide and then the accusation of murder is woven into every scene. The reader becomes completely entangled in their world.<br /><br />I could not put this book down. I recommend it and the rest of Jodi Picoult's works.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Mars Volta is the most original band I've ever, ever heard. They combine the great rhythm and sound of Rock with the long-but cool progressive style. Most of the songs are longer than usual. Some are 13 minutes long. Their rock is original and different in the best kind of way. <br /> <br />The singer has a strange but likable voice. The drummer is frickin' awesome! Very Very Talented! The Guitars are really good too. Some of the coolest. They also add a variety of instruments (by various people) such as the trumpet. The CD case is very Arabian so I subconsciously define they're music as Arabian. Arabian Rock. Very cool (although they're from LA). <br /> <br />The words...o man. They are so freaky weird. \\"I tied a rope around her legs and let her hang for seven days this never happened I watched you crawl into a bed of broken windows this never happened\\". See. It sounds like a rough translation from a different language (some songs are sung in a different language which I can't define) but they're American so I can't understand it. The strange words just add to the originality. <br /> <br />Some portions of the CD are just noise but it's made up by many enjoyable and very fast rock songs. If you look on the back it says there are only 5 songs (some split up into sub-songs) but there are actually 12 tracks. The names are funky also: \\"Plant a nail in the navel stream\\" and \\"Miranda that ghost just isn't holy anymore\\".  I don't care. They're just names. <br /> <br />Definitely 5 (of 5) stars. THIS IS THE MOST ORIGINAL ROCK BAND YOU WILL EVER FIND (that's actually good. I'm sure there are some original but crappy bands too).  <br /> <br />Buy It. It's worth it. (Even if you're deaf. Buy it and know you have a really great rock album.) <br /> <br />~T*R!N <br />
6304806469|4.0|I was unable to sit through this.  Yes, I did like it as a kid (I'm 40 years old now).  I just got the sense you not only need to be a \\"kid at heart\\" for this one, you got to BE A KID.  It's just way too sugary sweet (not just a spoonful of sugar, but a full cup)... maybe it's just me.  I didn't last more than a half hour before I had to turn it off.  OTOH I recently saw \\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\\" (1971) and greatly enjoyed it.  Maybe it's just me.  Anyway... put it on for your kids, and go do something else while it's playing.    P.S. (edit) -- so many \\"not helpful\\" ratings... was it really not helpful in terms of making a purchasing decision, or did you just not like or agree with my opinion?
B0002OERI0|5.0|I always like Green day and I know that they are very good. Billie Joe is always a genius. But after I bought this CD, wow. it is overwhelming, the whole CD connect to each songs and make up a master pieces.<br /><br />The most impressive are the two over nine minutes compilations. It seems to be combined by several song but if you listen to it again and again you will find they are like a TV series, which have different episodes but all make sense together. Billie Joe is indeed a genius and he is a great musician.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|After reading some of the bad reviews of this DVD set and all the songs missing from it, I just had to say something about why Zeppelin isn't on the DVD. They would not give their permission to use their footage of the Live Aid Concert. They all felt they were not at their best that day and their performance wasn't too great. So they refused to let Bob Geldorf use their footage when he made this DVD. I'm sure a lot of the other performing artists had their reasons too for not being on the DVD. Maybe technical difficulties during the recording?Who knows. But it is still great to see some of the old bands again playing their hearts out! I would definitely recommend this! It's also a great buy for the low price.
0812550706|5.0|Say hello to Ender Wiggin, an average kid who likes to play games...with guns, armies, and null gravity!  In the world of Ender's Game, by popular science fiction author Orson Scott Card, the World Government is in control of everything, including our main character Ender's life.  Ender is selected to be sent to battle school, a place where the top military geniuses are trained to fight a war against a threatening alien race called buggers.  In the end, Ender realizes that he has merely been an unwitting pawn in a much larger chess game, and must find a way of redemption, and not only restore peace to the galaxy, but also within himself. <br /> There are a great many  reasons to read Ender's Game.  In this absolutely thrilling novel, you will experience the twists and turns of the book's ever-shifting an extremely well written plot, detailed and believable characters, and ongoing action, slightly shrouded in mystery. <br /> The twisting and turning plot is a key element which makes this book such a good read.  One chapter, Ender may be in battle school, merely trying to win a game.  Another moment, he may be struggling to overcome issues with his abusive brother Peter, or even fighting insanity as all of his troubles and fears weigh down upon him.  Of course, the book does have a common theme to it, so it's not as is if it sways completely off course. <br /> The detailed and believable characters in the book are plain necessities in any influential novel.  As the book delves further into Ender's deepest thoughts, you feel you know hi as a person, or even as if he's standing right next to you!  With his sister Violet, you can truly feel the strong bond that love creates between the two.  On the other hand, Peter, Ender's spiteful older brother, makes you feel a deep loathing inside, a dislike for him. <br /> The action comes from Ender's various exploits in battle school and the star-war waged against the buggers.  The mystery, though, comes from the buggers themselves.  Ender doesn't know much about them, how they think, or why they attacked Earth in the first place.  This idea is frustrating to Ender because, he realizes, that even though he knows absolutely nothing about the buggers, he is about to annihilate them from existence.  This adds a much needed mysterious effect to the novel. <br /> In conclusion, Ender's Game is a great work of science fiction, and I'm sure will be on the shelves of every book-lover.  A recommendation for this book would, in my opinion, only go to strong readers, but otherwise, all ages.  I would even dub this book a new classic.  Not for the faint of heart, Ender's Game is a book served raw, and just about  as good as they come. <br />
B0000024IE|5.0|Since 1990 when I made the mistake of listening to this album with earphones....(thus inducing a wonderful migraine headache) this has been my favorite Hip Hop (all-genre) album of all time.  What is amazing about Black Planet is that it is even more advanced and high powered than P.E.s second album Nation of Millions. The message and delivery from Chuck D is as intelligent and professional as possible and his powerful voice is supported by equally powerful tracks. The sounds, beats,ideas, and moods created on this album create a totally cohesive body of work.  Fear of a Black Planet is truly an album where all the parts come together like a Masters Thesis.   Congratulations to P.E. and thanks for setting a high standard for Hip Hop excellence.
0529064847|1.0|How this bible actually got an impramatur is beyond me. Cardinal Ratzinger specifically asked the impramatur on the Book of Psalms in this Bible to be removed and the book replaced with a previous translation, yet its still there.  <br />The Translation of the Old Testament is decent, however the translation of the Greek is sorely lacking in many areas. For example the Greek of John 2 when Mary asks Jesus to perform the miracle is \\"Woman, what has this to do with me and you?\\" While the NAB translates: \\"Woman what has this to do with me?\\" making this appear like a rebuke in line with protestant theology. Also, in Matthew 26, Jesus says in the Greek \\"Satan has asked for you [all] that he may sift you like wheat, but I have prayed for you (grk: sou=thee, singular) Peter that when you have been converted strengthen your brethren. The NAB makes no attempt either in footnotes or in the text to emphasize Peter's primacy, which of course makes it nice and ecumenical. These are just 2 of numerous theological problems that plague the translation.  <br /> <br />The footnotes in this bible are dubious at best, and heretical at worst. The authors reveal in their footnotes that they reject the literal sense outright and consider the entire old testament to be myth and story. However, the 1992 Catechism tells us the literal sense is the primary sense to understanding scripture (CCC 115), and Pope Leo XIII taught infallably that Catholics must interepret scripture by the literal and obvious sense (Providentissimus Deus). Yet the footnotes try to argue that the wars in the history books (1$2 Samuel, 1&2 Kings, 1&2 Chronicles, Ruth, Judith, Esther 1&2 Maccabees) were not in fact commanded by God but perpretrated by the Israelites who later ascribed them to God. Give me a break, they are essentially saying that the Ancient Israelites committed murder and genocide and then said \\"God told us to do it\\". If that is so then it throws the whole bible, and all of Christianity and Judaism into question (and by extension Islam as well).  <br /> <br />The footnotes are just pathetic heresies which even the Protestants were smart enough to figure out only undermines the Scripture and the Church itself when they cast out liberal 19th century protestantism. Its about time Catholics did the same, starting with the NAB, and burn every copy of it and remove it from the Liturgy.  <br /> <br />If you want a real Catholic Bible, by the Douay Rheims, or the Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition, and stay away from rubbish like this. Good study notes can be found in the Ignatius Study Bible, and also in the Catholic Apologetics Study Bible from Catholic apologetics International ([...]) which is beyond excellent.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|The story of Peter Pan is one that is near and dear to my heart. In that sense, I approached \\"Finding Neverland\\" with both excitement and fear, because I wondered what would be made with this film.<br /><br />Was it accurate historically? No, but it was beautifully done. James Barrie was 5'0\\", a small man who seemingly had a medical issue with adolescence, and in that sense, he never really did grow up. He married, but the marriage was supposedly never consumated. So, he could neither have children, or in his society, stay a child. Although he was a successful playwright, it is not surprising then that he became fascinated with the FIVE (in the movie, four) Davies boys as well as their parents (both were alive, as opposed to the movie.)<br /><br />The movie wove a new tale - allowing both Depp and Winslet to show the CONCEPTS even if not applying all the facts. The concepts were those of sadness and longing for the things you cannot have, as well as the belief that you CAN have those things, even if only in your mind, or in Neverland - which is a map of the mind, even Barrie says that in Peter Pan.<br /><br />This concept that your attitude decides your happiness has always touched my heart. My company is named \\"Second Star Creations\\" with that in mind. I believe James Barrie did a wonderful job portaying Peter Pan as the boy who would never grow up, and Wendy as the girl/woman wondering if she should.<br />Finally, I felt this wonderful movie showed similar concepts in portraying the author himself - those of enjoying life, even while being unable to have children of his own, and those of \\"trying to belong\\" in a world where he did not fit.<br /><br />You can indeed - \\"find Neverland\\" - in this movie.<br />Dan T. Davis, author - \\"The Blacksmith's Gift\\"
038551123X|4.0|I read this book while in a codeine cough syrup induced stupor.  Having said that, I really did enjoy it.  And I don't think it was just the codeine.  It really was good.   <br /> <br />I was first attracted to the book because of the title.  I'm a sucker for alliteration.  It was a different spin on the whole murder mystery genre.  I will definitely have to check out the next installment, \\"Darkly Devoted Dexter\\".
B000268QB2|5.0|through this album and listened to it twice in a row. I may have to listen one more time before bed. Highly recommend this album. I have to get some Travis apparently too. :)
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Give yourself a treat, and play this and any current \\"new\\" band that is the best next thing.  You will quickly realize that \\"new\\" band isn't worth the packaging, etc...<br /><br />Remember what music was about.  Give this a spin!
B0002S947K|5.0|What a wonderful debut album.  I love David Gray and find Ray's husky melodies captivating.  The first track Trouble gives a great entre to the tone of the album, my favourite track is  Shelter, the lyrics are full of emotion and the melody hooks you right in. Some weak points but they are much overshadowed by the great. I will be watching for the next album.
0812550706|2.0|Ender's Game's main character is Andrew Wiggin. He lives on Earth, in a far away future. He is nicknamed Ender\\" by his loving sister, Valentine. He is six years old, but a genius at that. Since he was three years old, he has worn a monitor, in which the government could keep him safe. Now they have taken it off his body. Ender now becomes the target of the big kids at school. After he instinctively injures a bully, the International Fleet wants to recruit him. The IF's main objective is to fight off the Buggers, an alien species that nearly wiped Earth's whole population away 50 years ago. He won't get to see his family for ten years, because he will be in training. General Graff, the principal figure, tells Ender that he will go to Battle School and learn to fight the Buggers. At Battle School, they play laser tag and video games to boost strategy.  <br /> Ender's Game is an unusual novel, and the thought of laser tag may seem cheery, but this is a dark novel. I personally don't recommend this book to the \\"average\\" crowd. Only total science fiction lovers, and war lovers, should read this book. <br /> So if you absolutely are craving to read this book, get it now!! <br />
0812550706|5.0|<br /> I thought the book Ender's Game was a classical story with great characters. Ender is a under sized kid in a world that is built for big kids. Ender, brother, and sister are all geneses. His brother didn't go to the camp because he was too violent and his sister was too attached to things.  <br /> The plot is about the government trying to evolve boy geneses into great generals. Ender is trying to make friends when Cornel Graff keeps advancing Ender to higher classes so he doesn't get any friends and remains isolated. Ender finally gets friends and starts his own morning practice. Ender gets his own command army and becomes a great leader and commander. Ender and his friends are old enough to start fighting the virtual bugger practice rounds. <br /> I thought Ender's Game was a great book and Orson Scott Card does a really nice job describing the characters and showing their emotions I thought Ender's Game was the best book I read this year. You should take a ride on the ship.                                <br />                                                                <br />
B00003CXD5|5.0|Daddy, Walter Houston lights up the screen in son John's brilliant adaptation of B. Traven's timeless novel.  Aided and abetted by Humphrey Bogart and Tim Holt, this three man morality play set in the exotic, brutal and beautiful locales of Mexico packs an emotional punch and never fails on entertaining.   <br /> <br />Bogart has received criticism that his acting here was hammy, but I feel otherwise.  His Fred C. Dobbs is an astonishing portrait of a man who loses his way and flies past redemption.  One wants to route for Dobbs, but his inevitable slide into obsessive greed becomes a journey of madness and paranoia that is the equivalent of a roller coaster ride.   <br /> <br />Undersung American actor Tim Holt shines as Curtin, Bogart's nave, trusting pal who, despite saving Dobbs's worthless hide - several times - still gets shafted over by him.  Holt's performance is, while typically understated, the glue that binds this entire story together.   <br /> <br />Firsttimers will be amused to find \\"Sierra Madre\\" as the original source of the line \\"we don't need no stink'n badges\\" which has affected American culture for more than 50 years now. <br /> <br />It's wonderful to see this in a new 2 disc release with so many extras.  Hopefully my generation, and those behind it, will discover this amazing movie.  <br />
B00003CXCS|5.0|It almost seems like this wonderful musical will last forever. There is great music and great themes. Julie Andrews shone brilliantly in this movie.

It is so emotional and brings tears of joy to my eyes time after time.<br /><br />Musical (Memorial 341/1)
B00005JMEW|5.0|Many have complained/slandered Quentin Tarantino for his use of heightened, over-the-top violence in Kill Bill Volume 1.  Those who would think twice would know that Tarantino was raised on the old martial arts movies from the 70s, etc.  In these movies, blood would fly in squirts of red water.  So, its no surprise to me that Tarantino would create his magnum opus as an homage to these early movies that gave him so much joy. <br /> <br />As it is, Kill Bill Volume 1 is an exciting, very blood-filled revenge story.  It's also very different from Vol 2.  It sets up the Kill Bill universe, while introducing The Bride.  In fact, Vol 1 is a trial by fire for The Bride, effectively being a training ground for her where she will learn who she is and who here enemies are.  In fact, the first movie can be considered a \\"coming of age\\" story where the Bride finally comes into her own as an unstoppable brute.  She goes from having everything, to being in a coma, and then the movie shows her fight to get everything back (her coming into knowledge and power).  <br /> <br />Those who loved Pulp Fiction might not find the same dense storyline in this first volume.  The story here is basically for setting up the characters and giving you a hint of what's to come.  The second volume will answer questions and change what you think you know about the story, so just hold on through this one.   <br /> <br />This first movie, as stated earlier, is an homage to the old martial arts films but it is also an homage to Japanese cinema.  Not only do we have the very stylized violence of the martial arts films, but we have an amazing 10 minute anime sequence that is probably the most violent part of the movie.  We even have a master sword creator who will give The Bride her weapon of revenge.  The movie oozes with Japanese pop and cinema culture throughout the ages.   <br /> <br />I have never been a real fan of Uma Thurman but she excels in this movie.  You can tell this part was written for her and it amazes me that Tarantino is able to elicit such a terrifice performance from her where she has been merely adequate in other films by other directors. <br /> <br />I was thoroughly entertained by this movie.  The cinematography was excellent, the music fit with the theme of the movie, it was crafted, you can tell, with love.  It is a powerhouse of a movie where those who aren't turned off by the stylized violence will find excellence.  And then there's Volume 2 (if interested check out my Review Part 2: Where we learn of Bill on the Kill Bill 2 page)...
0393314804|5.0|Trainspotting was probably one of my favorite movies of all time, right up there with fight club. Just like Fight Club, I saw this movie as a high school sophomore and was blown away, Then on about the third time through youre reading the credits and discover, Hey.....this was based on a book! Well i have  been trying to hunt down a copy of trainspotting for awhile but every store was always either sold out or i had no money. well my friends alls well that ends well because i finally have my own copy, and its one amazing read. Written by UK madman irvine welsh this book is the story of several assorted, junkies,psychoes and scumbags, the neighborhood they call home and the societys that left them out. Its alot more than that though, because the characters are actually fully realized human beings that have real feelings and completely seperate views on sex, drugs, rock and roll(not kidding music is brought up quite alot) life and even each other. quick overview of the characters.<br /><br />renton-junky who is constantly in and violently out of recovery for his addictions, somewhat the main character. Insecure opinionated and cynical but also thoughtful and philisophical about everything.<br /><br />Dan\\"spud\\"Murphy- The Nice Guy. He never judges anything to harshyly and even though he does drugs,  his thoughts are usually with his friends. He's one loyal guy and loves everyone equally.<br /><br />Sick Boy(simon)-the classic ladies man. Hes your friend who has your back at all times except when you get shot down by a girl then he ditches you for her, the friend your always jealous of but, hey hes smart cool and its nice to be around people like that at times.<br /><br />Begbie-absolutely nuts. This man thrives on violence and making people pay, your friend because your afraid of him not being on your side, likes drinking, pain and talking about girls although he treats them like crap on the rare occaision he gets one. he doesnt do any drugs but hes probably the most despicable character in the group.<br /><br />Now thats all stuff youll already know if youve seen the movie but, trust me this book is an absolute must read. Things you won't see in the book, sketch chapters on life in Edinburgh, Renton' Itallicized \\"junk dilemma\\" entries, loads of characters not even mentioned in the book, especially the great character Davie Mitchell, who's short story \\"Bad Blood\\" is not to be  missed.Think of this as a directors cut for your mind. and dont forget to read GLUE and PORNO when you finish with this little gem(read this one first, theres a dialogue glossary, thats helpful for reading almost all of welsh's wonderful phonetically spelled slang)ble character in the group. <br /> <br />Now thats all stuff youll already know if youve seen the movie but, trust me this book is an absolute must read.

B0007TKNKG|5.0|It is completely about time that this has been released onto DVD.   I have been waiting so long for it to be released.   Why did it take so long for this movie to be released onto DVD when it was one of Stallone's most popular movies.   There are so many bad movies out there that were released onto DVD and they would never release this.  This is my favorite Stallone movie and I honestly think he looks his best in it.   This movie has always been one of my favorites that I've always loved and cannot wait to receive it on DVD.   It is completely true that the world meets no one half way.
B00005JMUA|5.0|(continued from the Kill Bill 1 page)... <br /> <br />Where Volume 1 was Tarantino's homage to old school martial arts films and Japanese pop and cinema culture, Volume 2 is a western.  On the surface, it's easy to think that these are two very different genres of movies but in theme that's not true.  Both deal with revenge.  How many martial arts movies and westerns have you seen where someone has been killed and must be revenged?   <br /> <br />The music is another connection to the styles.  In Vol 1, the music is more J-Pop and Japanese style in theme (look at the 5, 6, 7, 8s).  In Vol 2, Robert Rodriguez (director/writer of Desperado, etc) created the music (in fact, he did it for $1 with the intentions that Tarantino would direct a portion of Rodriguez's next movie for $1 which happens to be Sin City.  Make sure to catch that April 1st).  With Rodriguez's flair, the music becomes more western/mexican. <br /> <br />The other connection is that a lot of Asian films are like Tarantino's in that they are non-linear (i.e. The Grudge, etc).  Vol 1 was very non-linear in it's story-telling approach.  Vol 2, being more westernized, is told in a more linear way.  Not to say it doesn't move back in time then to the present, because it does.  But, in comparison to Vol 1, vol 2 is very much more linear.  And herein lies the brilliance of this movie.  Tarantino bridges the two cultures and cinema styles, creating an epic that is part Japanese and part American old West.   <br /> <br />In Volume 2 we learn that everything we thought we knew is probably wrong.  By this, I'm referring to Bill.  In Vol 1 Bill is an insidious voice at the other end of the phone, one hand on his sword, moving it up and down.  We hear his raspy voice and that's about it.  He is an pitch black character.  In Vol 2, when we actually see Bill and get to know his character, Tarantino has changed our perspectives.  Yes he is evil, but not only that, he is human.  A lot more human than we are led to believe.  It's creepy and makes his character more real. <br /> <br />The violence is more subdued this time than in the first one.  Where Vol 1 was a blood soaked revenge story, Vol 2 more resembles some of Tarantino's other stories.  It's filled with more awesome dialogue and more story.  Here we learn all of the answers to The Bride's past and how she got to where she was.   <br /> <br />There are still some awesome fight scenes.  The Bride's battle with Elle Driver is intense while strangely humorous.  My one complaint is that we have a 3 hour lead up to a very quick battle with Bill.  It's over too fast for me.  I was a bit let down.  Don't get me wrong, HOW it ends is excellent for reasons I won't spoil, but they get to that ending too fast unfortunately.  I was a bit disappointed.  But, that is a quibble in what is truly and excellent saga.  I can't say enough for this series.  It is amazing.
1400034779|3.0|This is a different kind of mystery novel, so much so that it doesn't really seem like a mystery. Even though the main character solves several different mysteries throughout the story, the interesting part of this book is how it is written. It's set in Africa, so it's different from your standard mystery novel right off the bat. Plus, Smith's writing style is quite different from anything I've read before. In addition, there is no one central plot to this story, although there is one big mystery that Precious must solve. I didn't love this book, as many reviewers did, but I found it interesting and unique, so I must commend it for that.
1891252089|5.0|Can't go wrong with anything David Swenson does.  He is, simply, the best.  This is the Bible for ashtanga yoga.  Don't bother with anything else.
0812550706|5.0|In the book, Enders Game, Ender is thrown into a world of mystery and deceit.  Ender is a boy genius, capable of accomplishing great things.  Ender has been rejected to go to battle school because of how he was monitored as a youth.  Yet still, the people at battle school kept on monitoring him.  They then saw what he could do on his own and changed there mind about not taking him to battle school.  At battle school, there is a room with no gravity.  It is called the battle room.  There, children at the school have fake battles.  There are two armies, each one trying to get through the other armies door.  They don't use real weapons though; just fake lights that freeze a person when flashed.  As Ender fights in the battles, he becomes the best in the standings.  This leads to many conflicts with other children and eventually leads to a fight.  After a couple of years there, Ender is sent to an elite school called Command School.  There, Ender commands squadrons on fighters in simulators.  He trains here for the upcoming fight against the Bugger Nemesis, an evil alien race raving for Earths destruction. <br /> I would recommend this book to anyone, especially people into sci-fi novels.  It is not your everyday picture book though, so it might be for stronger readers.  I was not really into sci-fi novels until I picked up a copy of Enders Game.  It really is an exhilarating tale with many twists and turns, not to mention an ending fit for a king.  <br /> <br />
B00005JLEU|5.0|Like many others, I first encountered \\"Spirited Away\\" when it took the Best Animated Picture Oscar, and was theatrically re-released. I originally went with some trepidation, because while I'm a huge animation buff, I've never cared much for anime. I went to see Akira in the middle of its hype, and walked out shaking my head, muttering \\"All style, no substance. Depth of a puddle.\\" I've since had others tell me Akira was overrated. I'm inclined to believe them. <br /> <br />Anyhow, Spirited Away changed my mind forever. Saw it twice in the theater, and bought the DVD the minute it ame out. What a gorgeous film. Distrubing images? Certainly. Like ANY good fairy tale. Snow White, Pinocchio, Alice In Wonderland, Oz-these all contain bits of nightmare. But it's \\"Good Scary\\" as opposed to mindless fright. <br /> <br />Is the movie confusing? Only if you need to have plot lines and characters telegraphed to you. If you don't like to think about a movie, by all means, run screaming from Spirited Away. But if you  enjoy immersing yourself in a fully formed alternate reality, this is your flick. <br /> <br />And what a wonderful message. Chihiro only begins to triumph when she sets herself aside, and sacrifices for the sake of others. Some of the imagery of her sacrifice (Haku's purging of the blackness inside) is spirituality of a high order. <br /> <br />I can understand why serious anime fans might be able to nitpick this movie. It's the same with anyone who's deeply into a subject matter. But, if you're a film fan, especially one new to anime, this is a masterwork, pure and simple. Arguably one of the finest films ever made, any genre, any era.
0743454529|5.0|If this book had been food,it would have been a whole box of doughnuts.Definitely \\"a keeper\\".    This was my first meeting with Jodi Picoult's writing and it took my breath away.  Between, laughing and crying I found myself wandering around in the lives of the characters, who by the way all evoked my passion in one way or another.  Thank you to Jodi and I can't wait to read my next.
B00006FDCD|3.0|\\"It\\" is a made-for-TV movie, but don't let that fool you, because it's one of the best movie adaptations for a Stephen King's novel that I have ever seen. Usually his books are condensed and reduced to trashy, boring, low-budget movies, and that's unfair, because King is one of the most recognized writers in the genre (if not the ultimate writer in the genre). <br /> <br />With the exception of movies like \\"Carrie\\", \\"The Shining\\" and \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\", among few others, \\"It\\" makes one of the best movie adaptations to a Stephen King's book. Of course, usually is better to read the book, than seen the movie based in the book, but let me ask you something: how long does it take you to read a page of a book? Between 1 to 3 minutes, right? So I don't understand when someone expects that a 1000 pages book should be completely adapted to screen. Nobody wants to see a movie with a length of 1000 minutes. <br /> <br />Putting aside the obvious licenses that this movie takes to condense the book, \\"It\\" is a very compelling movie, specially the first part. All the kids did a splendid work in this movie, every single kid was able to reflect on screen emotions like fear, friendship, happiness and loneliness. As a matter of fact, the only grown-up whose performance was at the same level of the kid's performances, was Tim Curry as the evil Pennywise. Tim did a great job with his eyes, he really looks like a demonic clown, of course the make-up is great, but Curry did an outstanding job as the frightening Pennywise. <br /> <br />The second part of \\"It\\" isn't as attractive and emotional as the first one, the movie starts to lose steam, but it's good enough to keep the audience interested in the story. \\"It\\" is a good adaptation, the kids are just amazing, Tim Curry as Pennywise is one of the best villains in a movie based in a Stephen King's book, the characters make a genuine connection with the audience (specially if you are a kid, like the characters in the first part), the music is chilling, and all that results in a good movie.
B0007DAZW8|4.0|Do you fear change? If you do then 'Human After All' is not for you. If you want an album just like 'Discovery' look elsewhere. Why must people have to hear an album just like their last or their best? Music changes with the artist's emotions, surroundings, and time. Daft Punk is all over this. They don't fit the stereotype of popular music. They are music PUNKS. <br /> <br />I feel the cover of this album reflects the sound of the album: gritty, balsy, and vintage. In this album you hear the analog basses and distorted guitars with robotic and tweaked voices. Sure it's repetitive, but isn't that what electronic music is about?  <br /> <br />'Human After All' isn't better or worse than their previous two albums. Live in the now and drop this CD into your player... and bust out the robot rocking inside you! (haha)
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|Tim Burton, one of the finest active directors, returns with another great movie, \\"Big Fish\\". The film is narrated in a very interesting way, it is divided in episodes, some of them show the current time, and some of them show the past of the characters. We are witnesses of the fantastic and supernatural adventures that Edward (the main character) lived in his youth. <br /> <br />The young Edward, played by the charismatic Ewan McGregor, goes through the funniest situations, he meets a lovable giant, he goes through an enchanted forest, he arrives to a wacky town where everybody threw their shoes to the electric wires, he works in a circus packed with freaks, he meets a poet that has written only three lines in the past 12 years, he goes to the war and he meets the love of his live. And those are only half of his adventures. <br /> <br />The cast of \\"Big Fish\\" is excellent, it's a combination between veteran actors (Albert Finney, Jessica Lange, Danny De Vito), remarkable actors (Ewan McGregor, Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi), and young talent (Alison Lohman, Billy Crudup). <br /> <br />The technical aspect in \\"Big Fish\\" is another highlight of the film, the locations are very colorful, the visual effects aren't as pretentious and overwhelming as in other movies, but they are simple, realistic and effective and get the job done. The makeup and the costumes are also excellent. Finally, the music is outstanding, it combines classic tunes with the original score, written by Danny Elfman. <br /> <br />It's a huge mystery why this film was so underrated and ignored by the Academy, it is much better than \\"Seabiscuit\\", for example. Anyway, \\"Big Fish\\" has it all: fantasy, drama, comedy, adventures, sad moments, tender moments, unforgettable characters, interesting situations, an all-star cast, in few words this is a little gem. <br /> <br />The audio and picture in this DVD are crystal clear, and the DVD extras are amusing and informative, there are not too many extras, but there are really good. However, the DVD does include a valuable audio commentary, courtesy of Tim Burton. So if you like fantasy films, this is a very good one, \\"Big Fish\\" is a great addition to any DVD collection.
B0007NFL18|2.0|I hate Fat Joe, i hate Nas, but when 50 just starts dissing people it's like he's got no talent. Get Rich or Die Tryin was exceptional, but now that 50 knows he's got a crowd he's releasing this crap. <br />Worst song- Piggybank- completly ripped off from Ja Rule. All 50 does is diss Jadakiss, Fat Joe, Nas and Ja Rule. I dont buy a CD to listen to disses. 0/5 <br />Best- Hate It Or Love It (G-Unit Remix)- The Game's version is better. The lyrics are good. 4.5/5 <br />
B00005QAPH|4.0|Federico Fellini's cinema displays one of the most mysterious and influential styles at the same time, modern filmmakers such as David Lynch owe a lot to the italian director. With \\"8 1/2\\" happens something very interesting, there are some scenes that are almost incomprehensible, but they are very interesting to see, because since the movie offers few explanations, the audience must be thinking most of the time, trying to solve the puzzle, so \\"8 1/2\\" requires an active audience. <br /> <br />The cast is very good, the obvious mentions are Marcello Mastroianni and the gorgeous actress Claudia Cardinale, but Anouk Aime (as Luisa, the central character's wife) is another highlight in the cast. \\"8 1/2\\" presents some of Fellini's trademarks: there are a lot of surreal scenes that look like a complicated dream, or a nightmare if you wish. The use of the camera is very artistic and groundbreaking. And the pace is slow, but captivating. <br /> <br />From the opening scene, a mysterious and beautiful dream-like sequence, to the final scene, \\"8 1/2\\" is an intelligent and insightful movie. Fellini carefully introduces the viewer inside the mind and thoughts of Guido, his fears, passions and insecurities, making Guido a very complex character. \\"8 1/2\\" is a movie that lovers of cinema in its more artistic expression will enjoy specially.
B00004R99U|3.0|I live in Central Virginia, not far from where the real story took place. Does anyone realize who Pocahontas *really* ended up with... hint: NOT John Smith.<br /><br />This movie is well done and my 3-year-old daughter likes both the original and the follow-up immensely! I can't wait until she's old enough to study the true stories. We will certainly have a great time when we compare and contrast the original happenings with the Disney versions.
B00000ILDF|3.0|David Fincher was the chosen one to direct the third installment of the \\"Alien\\" series, and even though Fincher eventually proved to be a great director with the movies \\"Seven\\" and \\"Fight Club\\", he wasn't completely ready in 1992 to take care of a well respected franchise like this one. <br /> <br />The highlight in \\"Alien 3\\" is without a doubt the cinematography: the dark photography, the sets, the atmosphere and the special effects are very good, the overall mood in this movie is dark and claustrophobic. But the story is not as involving as it was in the first two movies. At the very beginning we learn that beloved characters that appeared in \\"Aliens\\" are dead, and the only survivor was our favorite movie heroine Ripley. <br /> <br />The new characters are almost disposable, but there are some interesting characters, like Dillon (played by Charles S. Dutton), a hard nose, religious, strong willing man. Of course, the heart and soul of the \\"Alien\\" franchise is Sigourney Weaver (more than the Aliens themselves), she gave a strong and solid performance. <br /> <br />Maybe in 1992 this movie was a disappointment, but now that the things settled down, \\"Alien 3\\" is an interesting installment in the series, even if the first two movies are definitely superior.
B000088E77|5.0|you have probably heard \\"Down under\\" on the radio and liked it, but not known who played it.  Well, if you have heard a song that went \\"we come from a land down under...where women glow and men plunder (I think those are actual lyrics)\\" then that song is on here.  Far from one hit wonders, these guys were able to put out an album chock full of brilliant compositions.  It was a career defining album, and was never really surpassed by them afterwards.  It is a fun sort of album, just having some fun with great music.  They are one of the best bands to come out of Australia, and are well worth your listening if you missed out on them back in the day.  Highly recommended 80's classic, along the lines of Pat Benatar, Cyndi Lauper, The Buggles, and the other cool musicians from that time.  I have the original version of this disc, but based on the strength of the normal tracks, I can easily say that the new ones will also be fun and brilliant.
B0002858YS|4.0|I was forced to buy this after liking \\"Somebody Told Me\\" and hearing a couple of comments comparing The Killers to Duran Duran (my all-time favourite band). Having listened to it a few times there are a couple of naff tracks in there, but on the whole it's pretty good. <br /> <br />I guess one of the things I particularly like is the way that the Killers have blended some of their influences into what is essentially their own sound. While still sounding like The Killers, there are obvious comparisons on \\"On Top\\" to Duran Duran (the only Duran Duran influenced track in my opinion) - the first line in particular, \\"Remember Rio and get down\\" provides an obvious reference - New Order on \\"Believe Me Natalie\\" and even U2 on \\"Midnight Show\\". <br /> <br />The most obvious influence I noticed was that of The Cure, perhaps due to the similarity in style and tone between Brandon Flowers vocals and those of Robert Smith. In \\"Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine\\" even the bass harks back to The Cure. <br /> <br />The standout tracks for me are \\"Jenny...\\", \\"Mr Brightside\\" and \\"Smile Like You Mean It\\". <br /> <br />I would definitely recommend listening to this if you like the bands I've mentioned.
B0007OASII|5.0|This album is awesome!  The songs are excellent, especially the epic 'Memento Mori'.  Khan's vocals on the ballad 'Abandoned' are heartbreaking.  I even liked Shagrath's growls on 'March of Mephisto', they completely fit the song. Simone Simons (of Epica, the band) vocals are beautiful on 'The Haunting'.  It's hard to pick a favorite, because they're all so good!  The production is perfect, and each different layer (i.e. guitars, vocals, orchestra, drums) melds together effortlessly.  For those who wonder, this album does not sound like Epica part 2.  The Black Halo has a much darker, more mature feel to it, with so many nuances that one could get lost for hours in the music.  Kamelot has created a masterpiece, and I bow down to them for it.
B00005JNPZ|1.0|I was dragged to see this be a friend. I could barley keep from walking out. WIll SMITH is the most annoying \\"blank\\" in hollywood (you fill in the blank). This was almost as bad as I Robot!

B000002UZ4|5.0|Pep Shop Boys fused European beats with sharp pop sensibilities to produce their numerous chart-topping hits. This one CD has just about everything, except for the several albums released in the mid- to late 90s (which contain some awesome tunes). While this compilation is by no means complete, it does provide a good aural snapshot of the 'Boys from the beginning through the mid-point of their careers. <br /> <br />From the great bassline of \\"West End Girls\\", the thundering sound of \\"Always on My Mind\\", to the hearfelt longing of \\"What Have I Done To Deserve This\\", these songs are 80s classics. <br /> <br />Lowe and Tennant were ahead of their time, and this CD proves it.
0786915749|5.0|I have been a fan of the Dragonlance Series, and particularly the Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman series' for many years. Not only have I bought many copies for friends, but I have recommended them to more people than I can count while working at a major bookstore. I have never had a complaint. This is the begining of a great series of books which introduces a vast world, with a history and way of life that is very well developed. The authors were the creators of the Dragonlance module for Dungeons and Dragons, so the development of the world was very important. <br /> <br />I have recommended this book to people ranging from Grandparents to 5th graders and I have always heard praise. Arguably, the books get better the further down the series you read, but this is by no means a \\"poorly written book\\" or anything else that people have said.  <br /> <br />Allow me to address a few of the complaints that people had. One person had a problem with some of the grammar... well the thing is... this is fantasy and so the traditional rules do not matter as much. It is possible that different races have better or worse grammar than other races. For example: Gnomes in the Dragonlance Universe talk very fast and are long winded... so in the books it appears tobeallmergedinonelongword. This does not mean that the publisher or editors ommitted spaces. Also, some have said that the writing style is not as good as other authors: Like R.R. Martin, Goodkind, Lackey, Jordan and others. Well, they are quite a bit shorter and yes they are quite different, but to me they are apples and oranges.  <br /> <br />Now, the things that I liked about the Chronicles Trilogy. First, and foremost just about everything you can think of is in these books. There is humor from a race called Kender (natural theives who are so innocent-minded that they don't even realize that they are stealing... and have no fear) and Gnomes, Action from battles between many of the races of good and the races of evil, romance between a couple of different couples (there is nothing gratuitous). All of the bases are covered by this trilogy which begins with Autumn Twilight. <br /> <br />This book was based on the ACTUAL roleplaying of each character. After Weis and Hickman developed the Dragonlance Campaign setting they decided to play-test it, and the result of this is more than just an author sitting down to write a book, but actually living the book in a sense. <br /> <br />Lastly, this book introduces a world from which all of the Dragonlance books are spawned. In the Chronicles Trilogy you hear about legendary heroes like Huma and there is actually a book about the legend of Huma, you will hear about Minotaurs and there are books about Minotaurs (set in Krynn) so this is not some couple books and that's all, there is a whole world with a history and customs, locations (and even recepies... like Otik's Spiced Potatos) to explore and read about. <br /> <br />There is a reason all of these books were NY Times bestsellers... and it's not becuase there are a few fanatic fans. Everyday I see more and more people reading fantasy books and I always hear that people have read and enjoyed Dragons of Autumn Twilight.  <br /> <br />Then again... this book is not for everyone, and there are bound to be people who don't like it, I would say... give it a try at least. ENJOY!
B0000648WZ|1.0|One thing I've never understood is why Hollywood directors seem incapable of taking any of Robert A. Heinlein's books, which are all written with marvelous visualization that begs adaptation to the big screen, and turning them into a movie without managing to screw them up completely and lose the message completely.  All they have to do is film what he wrote and they'd end up with a tour de force.  Instead, the three novels of his that have been filmed have ended up unrecognizable to his readers.<br /><br />I would not be so infuriated if Starship Troopers wasn't such an important work in the science fiction pantheon.  Heinlein made very cogent points about the responsibilities and obligations of citizens to their nation, and about how the military obligation is part of that, and why it is part of that.  The book won the Hugo Award, science fiction's Oscar, in 1960; and it has never been out of print; and it's been translated into twenty-plus languages that I know of.  When you take on the task of taking a book like that and turning it into a movie, you must tread lightly on the material; and the one thing you may not do is to be untrue to the spirit of the book.<br /><br />I regret to say that Paul Verhoeven not only failed miserably in the event, he trampled on the spirit of Heinlein's book and superimposed his own message - that all military culture is fascist and that all soldiers are animals and fools for falling under the spell of the military - over it.  In essence, he hijacked the title, stripped the story back to its bare bones, and re-fleshed it into a Frankenstein's Monster of his own creation that bears but the merest relation to Heinlein's novel.<br /><br />Before seeing the movie, I had thought that Verhoeven was the ideal director to take on the project.  My basis for this belief was the magnificent message about the human spirit that he imbued into his movie, Robocop.  After seeing the utter crock that he and his screenwriter made of Starship Troopers, and how completely he missed Heinlein's point, I'm in favor of having Verhoeven drummed out of the Director's Guild in disgrace.  The mere fact that someone has made a successful science fiction film does NOT mean that he is the ideal director for every science fiction movie that comes along.<br /><br />Frankly, this movie is so bad I recommend against anyone buying it.  My hope is that now that CGI costs have so drastically declined from what they were a decade ago, a COMPETANT director who respects the material and understands Heinlein's vision and message will remake this movie, and do it right. I encourage everyone to read the book Heinlein wrote.  However, give Verhoeven's piece of tripe a big miss; it is not worth wasting your time on.roopers, and how completely he missed Heinlein's point, I'm in favor of having Verhoeven drummed out of the Director's Guild in disgrace.  The mere fact that someone has made a successful science fiction film does NOT mean that he is the ideal director for every science fiction movie that comes along. <br /> <br />Frankly, this movie is so bad I recommend against anyone buying it.  My hope is that now that CGI costs have so drastically declined from what they were a decade ago, a COMPETANT director who respects the material and understands Heinlein's vision and message will remake this movie, and do it right. I encourage everyone to read the book Heinlein wrote.  However, give Verhoeven's piece of tripe a big miss; it is not worth wasting your time on. <br />
B00005QK3W|1.0|Anticipating a good follow up (of new material) to the admirable Flaming Pie, I Bought this album pretty much on its release date. There's no other way to say it, but this album is just plain bad. The first four songs are alright at best, but listenable. I don't mind \\"Heather\\" or \\"Riding into Jaipur\\". \\"Rinse the teardrops\\" could've been decent if it wasn't a half an hour long,or so it seems. Other than that the rest are throw aways. I have all the McCartney going back to, well \\"McCartney\\".  <br />With the exception of this album and if you want to include the Oobu Joobu (Best Buy), every McCartney album has something great on it. On the other hand, just about every album has something you can do without. There is no problem free McCartney album, with the exception of \\"McCartney\\" and \\"Red Rose Speedway\\", his best albums as a whole.

B0007GAEW6|3.0|Before I start, I should say that The Mars Volta is quite possibly the most innovative band of the post 1980 era.  With this in mind it's easy to see why I consider their first album, 'Deloused in the Comatorium,' the most successful experiment in genre-merging mind-bending music I've ever had the pleasure of listening to.  However, this left me with extremely high expectations for their second full-length release.  I think my friend said it best when he stated \\"This album has moments of absolute brilliance.\\"  Keep in mind the keyword 'moments.'  While still an enjoyable album on the whole, I found the listening experience somewhat hollow compared to the grandeur of the previous album.  It seems Cedric and the gang are simply capitalizing on the parts of Deloused they recieved critical acclaim for.  They recieved a Latin Grammy, so now they have increased the level of Latin-esque style in their music.  This is especially true in 'L'Via L'Viaquez.'  The melodies get so repetetive that it shifts from being creative and stylistic to boring and drab.  Then there's 'The Widow', which sounds simply like a rehash of 'Televators' from the previous album.  Not all is bad though.  In fact there are a few periods in this album that made me want to jump up like I was watching a sports game, hoping that they wouldn't drop the ball.  But with no clear direction, many of the songs simply either wander off or repeat two sections again and again.  Certain sections of 'Cygnus, Vismund Cygnus' and 'Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore' display the same high-energy exhiliarating flair that I've come to love from Volta.  The beginning of Miranda Part B is beautifully frantic and dazzling.  In addition the section in Cygnus that uses three time signatures reapeating in a sequence (5/4, 6/4, 4/4 for you musicians out there) is nothing short of brilliant.  However, I wish that they developed this section more.  It's good to hear Omar playing around with the 6-strings again, but alotof his solo sections sound more like he's just playing around rather than doing a serious guitar solo.  It has it's moments, but I'd have to say that Frances the Mute is going to disappoint some hardcore Volta fans.
B0007DAZW8|3.0|I speak for all diehard Daft Punk fans when I say this long anticipated album is a bit disappointing.  The lightweight arsenal of 9 tracks, On/Off is 19 seconds of channel surfing, makes me feel a little cheated.  There are some good moments, layered in wicked sound, beefed by angry guitar samples, and funked out with vocoder, but it isn't enough.  It's hard not to compare Human After All to Discovery and Homework, two of the best albums the genre of dance/house music has ever seen, but after a 4 year hiatus this is it?  The album is worth your time, easily shaming what else is being produced right now, and you won't regret picking up a copy.  Stick to Human After All, Make Love (which would make any hottie move her hips), The Brainwasher (which sounds a lot like Green Velvet), and Television Rules The Nation.  Emotion has none, and tracks 2-4 seem unfinished.  This is their darkest album to date, but maybe it is a concept album, mirroring the technologically dependant sign of the times.  So Thomas and Guy take off those damned helmets and give us more.
B00005JMCN|5.0|One word. THE BEST! Ok, that was 2 words but you catch my drift!
B0002IVN9W|5.0|This is the best album I've heard in twenty years. I'd have to go back to Bowie's Scary Monsters to find an album that came out and had the effect this one does. It is simply overpowering and magnificent. Truly amazing. I won't go through song descriptions, but the first one brought me to tears the first time I heard it... and I didn't even know what they were singing about. <br />
B0006SSOHC|3.0|Wow, I am surprised I could sleep well the night after I saw Saw... lol... I love the gore and the puzzle ideas. I sometimes sit alone and think of other puzzles that would be interesting to think about. I think that the ending was well thought out and wonderful. Twisted Pictures is so da bomb.
B000002MP2|2.0|I'm not going to ignorantly scream out 'this is so not punk rawk' like most anti-green day people would say.  I do believe this deserves to be called punk rock...but this is not a work of 'genious,' by a longshot. <br /> <br />This album, although it has some catchy tunes here and there, is altogether a fairly boring, simple album.  Only a few songs have any technical guitar work in them at all, and as for the rest of them, they are all simple power chord riffs.  And there is nothing wrong with power chords, as long as you use them in a creative way and make every song different, yet fit together as an album.  Unfortunately, Green Day cannot accomplish this. <br /> <br />Let me get this straight.  Green Day are not good musicians.  They have done incredibly well with what talent they do have, and I have no problem with that, but none of these musicians...Billy more than anyone, are quite good.  I started taking guitar lessons roughly a year ago, and only a few weeks in was able to play all but a few songs on this album, because of their simple, easy power chord riffs.  I enjoy some simple, easy music also, but this album is just so repetative overall, which really makes the simple riffs even more annoying. <br /> <br />People, unless you really like Green Day, or want to be popular among your 'buddies,' please, pass this album up...along with all of Green Day's other works.  Might I suggest the clash or social distortion?  That is some real punk rock.  But what do I know...
B00003CWN3|5.0|Hillary Swank is wonderful in this film. It shows how homophobic and hateful some people can be. There are so many different kinds of people in this world, and we see a lot of them in this one film. That's what makes \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" so unique.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Each Slipknot album has been better than the last one, and this one here is no exception.  This is their most mature and diverse album yet, and IMO it's their best.  You've still got the great heavy stuff, as well as ballads, sythesizers, acoustics, even solos.  There's all kinds of good stuff here.  The band sounds better than ever, and Corey proves once again he's an awesome vocalist. <br /> <br />Now, give us another Stone Sour, dude.  And step on it. <br /> <br />
B00005NTN5|3.0|I loved Bound. Gina Gershon is SO HOT! Jennifer Tilly has the sexiest voice in the film. I could have done without the finger cutting off scene. But I guess is was part of the whole \\"Mob\\" effect. Sweet!
0060516402|5.0|I read this book 2 years ago with great excitement. Now having significantly progressed in my career I found this book even more meaningful.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|Guy Pierce as Leonard plays a man with a quest for revenge against his wife's rapist and killer, with only one small problem - he suffers from a condition known as anterograde amnesia, a long-term-memory disorder which prevents him almost entirely from coding any new memories. The movie's scenes move backwards, thus presenting as clearly as possible the experience of being perpetually stuck in the present, unable to recall what came just before. <br />For those of you who point out that the fact that Leonard could possibly learn that he *has* a memory disorder is a plot hole, you need only look at the famous case of H.M., a patient who had a critical brain structure removed in a 1953 attempt to cure his epilepsy - instead, the procedure only succeeded in removing his capacity to form new memories. However, H.M. *did* eventually realize and RETAIN that his long-term memory was not functioning properly, most likely through a combination of intense repetition and sheer deduction (as his capacity to think was largely unhindered). It's clear that the movie's writers have done their research - Leonard is an exemplary case of a *very* rare mental disorder. <br />That being said, the movie is also cinematically brilliant - it is hard to find fault in either the acting or the cinematography. The ending (or \\"beginning,\\" if you will) is thoroughly disturbing, leaving the audience with a *lot* to think about. <br />Fast-paced yet thought-provoking, with a perfect balance of ironic humor and tragedy, and scientifically accurate to boot, this movie earns a solid 5 stars.
0380807343|5.0|<br />How would you feel if you went through a door that took you to another world peculiarly the same as yours, but also strangely different?  That is what Coraline experiences after a few months in her new home. <br />Coraline loves exploring the unknown.  But one day, exploring get her into a mess of trouble with her \\"other parents\\" in the \\"other world\\".  Coraline goes wandering into the door that is a portal to the \\"other world\\" that is exactly like her own, but chillingly different.  She meets her evil \\"other mother\\", who plans to keep Coraline along with the other forgotten children, and to lure Coraline in her trap, she kidnaps her parents, which forces Coraline into the evil other world. <br />Coraline was a very thrilling book.  There were so many twists throughout the book, you never really know if she was going to make it.  The book kept me reading.  There were creepy parts of the book, like the demented talking rats that brought only negative messages to Coraline. <br />I enjoyed Coraline by Neil Gaiman.  I would recommend this book to anybody.  It is not too frightening of a book; it just has some parts that are disturbing that can stick in your mind for a while.  But besides that, I would suggest it to anybody because of the interesting plot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00028HBKM|1.0|There is not much of a narrative to this film. Instead you get too many scenes of gratuitous violence and suffering. I'm not a religious person therefore my comments are solely based on the film as a film. Apparently the director was expecting the audience to have pre-knowledge of this story. I didn't. The film never helped me to understand why people believed this man to be the son of god. I never understood why he was eventually crucified other than the fact that he defied the laws of that time by declaring he was the son of god. I feel the director could not see the forest for the trees. Apparently he was too far into his understanding of religion to provide a narrative that was sufficient enough to enable the less versed to follow the story. I have seen other religious films that have better conveyed this story (King of Kings for example). I am amazed that people actually paid to see this trash. I saw it for free and wanted my money back. I actually give it a 0 star, the system forced me to give it at least a 1.  <br /> <br />

B00065HKDY|1.0|Will Smith was recently in the news saying that AIDS had been created by White people to kill Blacks. I guess this movie must be his revenge for that. <br />It has little to do with Asimov's classic story. We get the usual cop on the edge who follows his hunches instead of the rules -- GIANT CLICHE!!! -- and then we get these White robots who want to wipe out Will Smith (a sure sign of artificial intelligence as the guys is such a nauseating, smug [supply own expletive]). <br />After this it just descends into action-special-effects Hell as any interest or storyline is squeezed out by Smith leaping around, probably supported by wires, as an army of CGI geeks try to keep up with overambitious and cartoonish special effects -- Crash! Blast! Kaboom! ...Yawn! <br />Nevermind the robots; Hollywood actors, directors, and producers should be programmed with &quot;the 3 laws of moviemaking&quot; - characters, story, and meaning. This pointless production breaks all three -- bad robot!
B0007DAZW8|2.0|Daft Punk's Human After All depresses me. Where did all the funky beats go? When did the electronic disco die? HAL is repetative, draggy, and annoying. Robot Rock is simply \\"Robot Rock\\" repeated many times (although, I have to say the track is one of the better on the CD) - Television Rules the Nation is an example of one slow dragging synth line going on far too long. The dance has died. =(
B00005KHJV|5.0|This is the movie all Hardcore fans have been waiting for. the Extended Edition of the first Big hit of the Series HalloweeN.

B00005JKHP|5.0|I'll be honest, this is the Greatest of the Trek films in my opinion. I own them all and have seen them all at least 50 times, i know the dialoge by heart for them all and i qoute them regularly. I love the vger cloud effects i guess either people and critics cant apreciate hard work or artistic skill or they have a short attention span.  <br />I think the Musical score is the best of any Star trek film, 8's score only comes close to equal. It is the thought provoking Film in the series. It is Star Trek in its greatest form. The thinking and thought provoking stories are what seperates it from Star Wars.  If you like flexing your mind and thinking occasionaly then watch this film. I admit that it does drag on, but im actually a litlled depressed when the end credits roll. It has a superb musicl score from the late Jerry Goldsmith and the visuals are stunning for back in 1979. Watch it and decide for yourself.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|The 70s were, despite excesses, probably the most important decade for the popular arts in the 20th century.  It was the golden age of pop/rock, which morphed into genres as diverse as proto-metal, funk, disco, American roots music, and singer-songwriter offerings.  The backlash against disco in the late 70s and early 80s was matched only by the way the audience turned on prog-rock or art rock, the kind that Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd dabbled in, the kind in which the Alan Parsons Project and Yes completely submerged themselves.  Logically then, this genre became the slowest to receive a 21st century redux. <br /> <br />But here now is the Mars Volta, a recombinant form of the college rock band At the Drive-In whose quirky poetics and punk energy made for interesting albums before.  All the old criticisms may come rushing back:  over-arty, over-long, indulgent, pretentious...but virtuoso playing, brave experimentalism, and dense grandeur separate the Mars Volta from the insubstantial or downright untalented artists on the radio in 2005.   <br /> <br />There is a place for the epic work alongside the digestible four minute pop or rock song.  And, yes, \\"Frances the Mute\\" is as arty as the Louvre.  The lyrics, with their majestic Latin titles, meandering Spanglish, and beat poet moments, out-quirk Tori Amos and Rufus Wainwright.  We live in a time hungry for substance, for mystery's struggle to become meaning.  The Rush-meets-Radiohead ethic of \\"Frances\\" is just the 70 minute slab of cerebral rock we need right now.  The vocalist, drummer, and lead vocalist are conspicuously gifted.  Patience to endure the album's running time, arty white noise ellipses, and occasional pomposity is rewarded by Mensa music with Led Zep's runic deep drumming, Pink Floyd's hypnotic deep dreaming, and Santana's latin flourishes.  It's music from the rock conservatory, refreshing because it was gone so long.
B000007VCM|5.0|2 cassettes that I worn through both by playing daily in my walkman in 1986 on the bus to school and then CD version I still enjoy today.  All I can say is Masterpiece!  The commercial success of some of the songs over shadows the true gems like 'Love' and 'The Phoenix' that make this album truly outstanding.
0316172324|4.0|\\"Blink\\" is an appropriate title for a book about the snap decisions that we sometimes make when heeding our instincts rather than making a detailed analysis. Malcolm Gladwell says that \\"thin-slicing,\\" or the use of narrow slices of experience to find patterns in situations and behavior, is often a more effective way to make a decision than through a lot of thought and an abundance of facts. He starts off with the story of a statue, purportedly rare and ancient, that was asserted to be genuine through careful analysis, yet was felt to be a fake through the instant intuition of some experts. He then presents a number of interesting examples, from speed dating to conducting warfare, from selling cars to interviewing job candidates, that demonstrate how to effectively make quick decisions based upon a small amount of data. Again and again he reminds us that less is more.<br /><br />There are fascinating anecdotes here that demonstrate the power of our subconscious mind. Gladwell presents some people whose sense of intuition is uncanny: a psychologist who, after observing a married couple for fifteen minutes, could tell with ninety percent accuracy whether they would still be married fifteen years later; a tennis coach who could tell when a player was about to double fault; a psychology professor who could read faces so well he seemed to be able to read minds.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are two problems with this book that detract from its strengths. First, there is little or no explanation given for how or why we might experience these phenomena. It is not a how-to manual, as there are no hard and fast rules on how to thin-slice our way to brilliant decision-making. And second, Gladwell cautions that we can often be misled by our snap judgments due to priming, prior bias or associations, and stress. He contends that we tend to base our judgment about something as much on its physical appearance or packaging as on its actual function. Doing incorrect thin-slicing led to the New Coke marketing fiasco, led to the election of a president who was handsome and charismatic but one of the worst leaders in U.S history, and kept many talented women out of top professional orchestras. Will this book change the way I come to decisions?  No. But it has been an informative read nonetheless, and it has given me more reason than ever to admire the mysteries of the human brain.<br /><br />Eileen Riebackg led to the New Coke marketing fiasco, led to the election of a president who was handsome and charismatic but one of the worst leaders in U.S history, and kept many talented women out of top professional orchestras.

0307277674|1.0|On the very first page, we encounter a pink-eyed, staring silhouette.  Ordinarily, the fact that a writer attributes eye-colour or an expressive gaze to a silhouette would not bode well for the reader.  However, in fairness to the author, I really don't think that the typical reader of this truly remarkable work is likely to know what a silhouette is, let alone notice or care.  For the rest of us, the joy is in discovering just how deliciously badly written it can get.  Which is 'very'.<br /><br />If you liked reading The Da Vinci Code, you might want to rent *Plan 9 from Outer Space*.  *The Creature from Planet X* was pretty good, too.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed John Mayer's *Room For Squares.* From the opening, catchy tune \\"No Such Thing\\" about running through the halls of his high school and spreading the word that there's no real world, it's apparent this guy has something to say and the ability to make us listen.<br /><br />He's a poet.<br /><br />His poetry is especially poignant in the song \\"Why Georgia,\\" when he sings about \\"the kind of morning that lasts all afternoon.\\" Yes, it's full of quarter-life angst, but some of us middle agers--if we remember correctly--can and will relate. Having grown up in a world of talented singer-song writers and wondering where they all went, John Mayer is a REFRESHING and welcome addition to my dusty CD collection.<br /><br />Also enjoyed \\"My Stupid Mouth,\\" and appreciated his musical humor . . . \\"one more thing.\\"<br /><br />Towards the end of the CD, the songs started to sound the same; however, I don't think that's a bad thing. It simply makes me want to listen again and again to pay closer attention to his thoughtful lyrics.<br /><br />Highly recommend. And P.S. for those critics who say this collection is nothing buy whining, listen to \\"Your Body is a Wonderland,\\" a beautiful love song from the heart.<br /><br />From the author of \\"I'm Living Your Dream Life\\" and \\"The Things I Wish I'd Said,\\" McKenna Publishing Group.
B0006SSOHC|3.0|I didn't really expect much from this movie,but I must say I was pleasently surprised. The charecters were abit sketchy at times but other than that, it is, a smart horror film which kept you guessing till the end pulling you in with stranger than fiction twists. Would have liked to have seen more of Glover,his charecter was just to under developed.Over all an enjoyable ride.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|I have this series that about 95% of Television Shows follow.  The theory is that if a show gets to a third season, than the third season will be the best (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Sex and the City, ER, etc.) <br /> <br />Gilmore Girls is no different improving from season two, the shows follows the adventure of Rory as she prepares to graduate high school, and finally go into college like she has been planning her whole life.  On top of that she has started a new relationship with the new guy in town. <br /> <br />Lorelia also has her share of fun and trouble this season as Christopher and his girlfriend get back together to raise there daughter.

B0006Z2LH4|4.0|Simply put: Cube focuses on \\"unwillingly\\" particpants/prisoners in a crazed game and Cube Zero zooms in on the makers of the same crazed game.  What Cube Zero also offers, to those who missed out on the first Cube, is insight on the particpants/prisoners as they crawl thru this maze of deadly rooms.  Although Cube was a thrill to watch, it does tend to get annoying as the characters begin to bicker and turn on each other.  Cube Zero jumps from makers to participants preventing the characters from being worn out. You are also given the reason these people were put into these rooms where Cube just throws us into the maze and offers no explanation as to how and why these people have been imprisoned.  In vain, that mystery is what makes Cube so intriquing.  Both endings are breathtaking and make the whole first 80 mintutes completely worth watching.
B00009W0U4|4.0|Irreversible makes a deep impression; though it was horrible, I wish all movies packed this kind of capacity for revulsion and visceral response. The film leaves an indelible, sickening impression right away-- in fact, many such impressions. It is so horrifying, so unbelievable and graphic that it is hard to watch but also impossible to turn away. The violence that unfolds as siren-like music plays, camera angles spin, red and darkened lighting, truly dizzying and nauseating-inducing atmosphere coupled with the tension and constant ominous feeling throughout-- something is always just about to go wrong.  <br /> <br />The story is told in reverse, much like Memento, and the most gory sights come almost right away in the film. The most painful and difficult to watch scenes (perhaps the longest, most brutal and uncomfortable rape scene in cinematic history) are midway through the film and along with it comes the slow and numbing realization that what was supposed to constitute \\"justice\\" and \\"revenge\\" at the beginning of the film was senseless and misdirected. By the end, with the film's \\"hopeful\\" revelations, it becomes so horribly sickening, real and clear what the characters have lost.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|The Mars Volta is a culmination of year's musical artistry. They have out done themselves with \\"Frances\\". Moving from song to song, more like one big song, in a way that is rarely heard. If you know the guys and the real life story and the people involved, the music is much more therapeutic. It is beautiful what Bix and Omar have created as a tribute to our past. Por todo que nos as dado, te doy mi gracias. Keep doing what you are doing, your way. Enjoy this CD as much as I have. Listen to the many guitar parts cavort with the rhythms and the imagery of the lyrics. If you like music that is still that, music, than this is a must have. If not, stand in line to get your favorite prepackaged pop star at a conformatorium near you.

0812550706|5.0|You know how when you are lucky enough to find a book that you get lost in, you are sitting there reading...and everything going on around you is blocked out and for just a time, you are completely lost in the story you are reading, basically living the story of the novel in your hands? For me \\"Ender's Game\\" was like that. I would get so caught up in the struggles of Ender, and his life at the battle school, I was completely oblivious to what was going on around me. This was the first Card novel I have read, but it won't be my last. I look forward to reading more of Ender's saga, but I am also leary of starting the next book for fear that it can't possibly be as exciting or as absorbing as \\"Ender's Game\\". The funny thing is, I am not really a fan of reading Science Fiction. But, Card has created such a wonderful, and at the same time awful, world and populated that world with such believable characters you can't help but get sucked into the story. Even if you are not a fan of the Sci-Fi genre, give this book a try, the strong character development and interesting story are worth it.

B000002UB6|5.0|There is no doubt that the Let It Be release is the most controversial and disliked of all the Beatles' recordings.  There are several reasons for this, but primarily the over-all aura of the recording is chaotic (the most chaotic of all Beatles' releases).  In addition, it was obvious that this was the end of one of the most influential rock bands in history and the recording showed it.  Personally, Let It Be has always been one of my favorite albums because it was raw and spontaneous and free from a lot of studio tricks and overdubs (minus Phil Spector's musical contribution).  The songs are honest and straight-forward (in fact the most honest that the Beatles had ever released).  My favorites are \\"Two of Us\\", \\"Across the Universe\\", \\"Let it Be\\", \\"I've Got a Feeling\\", and \\"Get Back\\".  Let It Be is truly a swan song release with a back to basics style that in many ways shows the Beatles incredible talents like no other recording before it.

B00005JN0T|3.0|This film was very good. It was better than most that are coming out nowdays. It is not \\"The Matrix\\" or anything, but it is very good, and it's fun, and that's cool.
B0000BWVCM|4.0|This movie was better than the first one, this had more action, more on the edge of you seat , a ggod movie, i hope another is one the way.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|This is an amazing film. It is very entertaining, and sucks you right in. No, nothing explodes, and there are no monsters or villians, but who needs them, when you have a beautiful film like this! <br /> <br />A must buy. :)
B0007P3582|5.0|This album is hot I like twelve songs on it .   Position of power & In my hood , are the most played jams along with candy shop feat . Olivia.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Spiderman is awesome. I really mean that. It is full of the good stuff that makes us feel good and makes us want to watch it over and over again. It is very humorous, action packed, and dramatic.<br /><br />The second one is also very impressive!
B0007PAMEM|5.0|This collection of Tina's best live performances is a must have for any Tina Turner fan.  While I am still waiting for a collection of her videos from the Virgin Records Days(1993-1999), this dvd provides a great deal of entertainment value.  Even though the concert clips are stretched over a period of 20 some years, they flow seamlessly from one to the next without you getting the feeling that anything is dated.  It shows that she still has as much power live today as she did when she debuted with Private Dancer.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Herry Potter is an extremely creative concept, and a brilliantly composed story. I have read the books, and the movies do a wonderful job of putting these masterpieces on the big screen.    If you like a really good fantasy film, see this.  Not just for little kids! :)

Principalmente El viajero. <br /> <br />Devo admitir que yo me esperaba otro arreglista; por ejemplo Ruben Fuentes. <br /> <br />Hojala y LM se anime y saque un segundo disco de mariachi. <br /> <br />Se imaginan un segundo disco con los acompaamientos y arreglos de El Mariachi Vargas, Los Camperos de Nati Cano, y el Mariachi Cobre? <br /> <br />Si ahun no lo tienes Compralo Ya! <br /> <br />Vien hecho Luis Miguel!
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|I was really disapointed that no greek wrote a review, so that's the only reason I'm doing this. Troy is a great Hollywood production with a stunning Brad Pitt. Go, buy the DVD and the soundrack too. it's a good movie! However, as another reviewer mentioned, \\"the less you know about Homer's Iliad, the more you enjoy it\\".  <br /> <br />I can understand all the extra romance, the fact that your hero cannot die before the ending scene, the absence of certain characters because 'we don't have all day', the fact that Menelaos had to be ugly, Paris had to be brave in the end and Agamemnon die (life had a much more wicked plan for Agamemnon actually), etc... I do, all these make a fair script. After all I'm a Hollywood addict. I love your movies. But, there are certain things that are not to be touched. And Homer's epic poems are among them. The script writer committed a crime, hybris I dare say.  <br /> <br />Basically, I have only one complaint.. Why take a classic masterpiece and turn it into a mediocrity (as far as the script goes, i cannot judge the rest)?? The dialogues are really awful compared to Homer's and they are completely out of context!There is no explanation as to why certain things happen. You know, the trojan war was a war of Gods as much -if not more- as it was a war of men. Gods play a critical part in Iliad. And another thing... the movie doesn't do any justice to Odysseas. In many aspects HE was the true star of the war!  <br /> <br /> <br /> Anyway, it all comes to this; If you can't get the essence of a story (due to lack of knowledge and cultural background, ok), please don't touch it... Write a nice script of your own and make a blockbuster. Otherwise, you hurt people :-( <br /> <br />
B00000099Y|5.0|Tool is one of the best bands that gave metal a darker feel to it. This CD proves it. Maynard James Keenan's vocals can creep even grown men out with this sick release. \\"Aenema\\" will give you chills down your spine. \\"Stinkfist\\" is also a classic. \\"H\\", you can't go wrong with that song. \\"46 and 2\\", also a classic. Other great songs are \\"Jimmy\\", \\"Hooker With A Penis\\", \\"Eulogy\\"...the whole damn album is good! Pick it up at your local record store, as you can't find it for download on Napster or iTunes.
B00066N8JS|5.0|Incredible. <br /> <br />I wont tell you how great this album is as (it would take too long and) you wouldnt be here if you needed proof. Its a true classic in every sense. <br /> <br />Now i recieved this remixed 2xCd pack last week and its the best purchase ive made in a long time. <br /> <br />I swear its allmost unsettling as to how much better this mix is in surround sound when compared to the classic stereo originals. If you have surround sound and a decent hi-fi or TV at home you will be surprised how fresh, how vital, how surprisingly up to date this album sounds. It hasn't aged. <br /> <br />If ever there was a album that cried out 'genius' and bekoned new fans toa genre that otherwise is stale and cliche'd its this album! <br /> <br />Even if your not a NIN fan id advise people to get this record as its the best surround sound album ive ever heard. Itstruly THAT good. <br /> <br />CLoser, Heresy, and Hurt has never felt so good! :)

0385335482|5.0|I am a senior in high school in an independent reading class.  I enjoy romance and comedy novels.  The book Confessions of a Shopaholic caught my eye because it's about shopping, and that's something that I enjoy.   <br /> <br /> In the book Confessions of a Shopaholic, Becky Bloomwood is seriously addicted to shopping, as you can tell from the title of the book.  She spends so much money and she can't afford it, and is unable to pay her bills, so, she decides to cut back on spending her money, but it seems like every time she goes out somewhere she sees something that she just has to have, so she buys it.  When she finally realizes that cutting back isn't enough, he decides to take drastic measures. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed reading this book; it caught my attention right at the start.  It really reminded me of myself, because I am one that loves to shop, but the difference between me and Becky Bloomwood is that I know when to stop.   This book is very fun and entertaining, and I would recommend this book to all women of all ages or to women who have a problem saving money, because it is just humorous and enjoyable to read.   <br /> <br />In conclusion, I thought this book was really good, and there was nothing in it that I disliked.  There are more shopaholic books out and I look forward to reading them all.  <br />
B00006CXXU|2.0|Christina Aguilera has a hot body and makes lousy music. <br /> <br />What more is there to say?
B0002OERI0|5.0|To me, and to many people out there, Green Day is a band that i grew up listening, and in the same process, grew up with me. I first started listening to them back in 5th grade, soon after 'Nimrod' came out. They were the first real 'rock' band i heard. 7 years on, on September 21st 2004, and hoping i would not experiance the same dissapointment of weary 'Warning', i rushed out right after work to get a copy of this record. What i got, was something i would have never expected. Green Day are back, stronger then ever.  <br /> <br />To compare Green Day's latest effort to their previous efforts, is ridiculous. Green Day are humans, and just like anybody, they grow up. They go through life experiances which they carry into their music. The record, is somewhat based on the life of Billie Joe Armstrong, lead signer and guitariest of the famous threesome. The record is based on a character by the name of, Jesus of Suburbia. The record takes you through the journey of his life, and through serveral other characters, including his split personality, St. Jimmy, and the girl who he falls in love with, Whatsername. I will not say more, and let the music speak for it self.  <br /> <br />To pick out songs from this record would be like taking off certain colors from a painting. This record is ment to be heard from start to end, just like a book. Green Day puts out thirteen (twenty-one) amazing tracks, which are not only good, but you will feel a connection to certain aspects of your life as well. Especially if you buy the special book edition and read the letters written, which will give you a more indept look and insight on Jesus of Suburbia life. <br /> <br />Its good to see this amazing band still around and doing what they do best after so many years, and im sure they will carry on. Hats off to a legendary band, and the best record of 2004, and possibly, the 2000's. <br /> <br />Even if you never liked their previous works, theres something for everyone here.

0767817478|5.0|Easily Matthew Broderick's finest work, Godzilla 1998 finally takes the concept into advanced territories that prior film makers had not even dared speculate upon.  The Godzilla monster is treated in the most evolved and innovative way ever applied to the character.<br /><br />The special affects are particularly dazzling, and the plot twists are exceedingly unexpected -- but none of this cinematic dazzlery can overshadow the powerful performance of the films actors, all lead by the most inspiring -- and unorthodox -- Matthew Broderick performance on record.<br /><br />In fact, it is clear that Broderick's provoking and disturbing interpretation of the Dr. Niko Tatoupoulis character, and his obsession with oversized worms, is the reason that the Academy snubbed Broderick and the entire film for any nominations that year.<br /><br />When the memories of the awards fade, however, it is the pure groundbreaking timbre of Godzilla 1998 that will make this film live on ad infinitum.
B0002858YS|3.0|Yes, they are immitating a style. And yes they are kinda fake (at least the accent is). And yes, they are hollow, silly, commercial etc, etc. I guess every negative remark about The Killers anywhere by anyone is justified in some way. <br /> <br />But in the end they've written a good handfull of extremly catchy and clever songs. They may be the musical equivalent of fastfood, but I do crave some fastfood every once in a while.
0596007124|5.0|This stuff is simply brilliant!  Unbelievable how they made learning the Observer Pattern seem like even a chimp can learn it. I just love how they start with a bare bones example and then build it up bit by bit.  This comic strip stuff is an absolutely fun and effectively a potent learning tool! Fantastic attention to details!
B00006F7S4|3.0|When this came out I couldn't get enough of it. Now, a couple of years later I hardly listen to it anymore and think of it as the least interesting Beck record. What happened?    Let's start with why I was so enthousiastic at first.     Apart from having made dozens and dozens of completely insane pary tracks, Beck has also written a rather good deal of genuinely touching songs over the years. Lyricly he never was that serious though, but on Sea Change that changed. For the first time in his career he is laying down his emotions and deepest feelings, not on one song, but a whole album long.     Needless to say the music on sea Cange isn't excactly party music as well (as on Mellow Gold, Odelay or Midnite Vultures). Rather than \\"two turntables and a microphone\\" it's \\"two orchestra's and a broken man\\".    I loved it. Couldn't get enough of quiet ballads like \\"Lonesome Tears\\" or \\"Lost Cause\\". The melodies on Sea Change were captivating and haunting at first.    But after several listens the production became more and more fuzzy, and I longed for the playfulness of his other records. The production just seemed too dense. And worse: the songs became a bit boring and tedious.    If I was to make a mixtape of Beck's work, I'd certainly throw a couple of Sea Change tracks in the mix, but as a whole the album falls short.    Yes, I have also called Sea Change Beck's masterpiece, but nowadays I'd say it's one of his weaker efforts.    I'd recommend Odelay.
B00000F1D3|5.0|It is one of the best Albums in the Last Times, excellent I work so much so  became a real classic, their singles ones were marvelously Astonishing, mainly that hymn to the Eternal love the called Song Believe which we will always remember in the entire world. <br /> <br />Do You Believe In Life After Love
B0006SSOHC|5.0|When I was watching the movie I figured that it was like the rest of them until the ending came about. Putting yourself in the victims place is the freakiest thing. Its a definite worth watching as long as blood and gorey scenes do not bother you. The film is more of a pyschological thriller vs a horror movie. It is very similar to the movie SEVEN with brad pitt.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Shania Twain is the best in the music country nobody it has arrived as far with music country as her, his new single Party For Two is excellent, all the songs of the Cd are art, clear the best are those that come from its Album Come on Over and Up! that they are very amusing,Of The 2 new songs Don't! it is very Beautiful anything Compared with the failure of Party For Two, the best of all is From This Moment it is magic, good alone I hope has good sales because this collection is very good and complete, all we should have it, the same as that of Robbie Williams.
B00012QM8G|5.0|This movie leaves everyone who sees it speechless. Even if you think youve seen it all, this film gives you a new view on WWII. You'll see the horrors of the holocaust yet see the compassion of a man who chose to give up his dreams to save the lives of so many. Its a film worth having.
B0001AP12G|5.0|this is best album of 2004. Hands Down there's not really to much else to say. Kanye if your reading HOLLA AT YA BOY!! I WANT TO BE DOWN!!! I got beats and rhymes as well. Keep doing your Kanye and bring real hiphop back!! <br /> <br />P.S. sister1 and 2 go suck a dick bicthes!!!!
B000001FTD|5.0|People who enjoy metal should at least have 1 Anthrax CD in their collection. For those who don't this is one of the best ones to have. All the tracks are awesome on this masterpiece.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|The best way i can rate this album is with one word. <br /> <br />WOW. <br /> <br />This is definitely worth every penny, if you don't buy this album and you call yourself a fan of real classic metal...you're a fool. <br /> <br />This thing scorches my speakers every time I play it.  This is so much better than any slipnot or any other crap like that. <br /> <br />HAIL THE PRIEST!
B00004T9UF|4.0|MARSHALL MATHERS LP <br /> <br />1. PSA 2000 <br /> <br />2. Kill you--Personally not my favorite song, but it grows on you the more it is played. <br /> <br />3. Stan--Good emotional depth, but doesn't have the drive to  make you wanna repeat it when it's done. <br /> <br />4. Paul <br /> <br />5. Who Knew--Delivered more like a defense speech than a rap but it's so lyrically risque you won't really care. <br /> <br />6. Steve Berman <br /> <br />7. The Way I Am--Point in the album where it reaches \\"classic\\" status. Good flow, but the last verse seems to fall under it's own weight. <br /> <br />8. The Real Slim Shady--this is kind of like a tv commercial in between a serial killer marathon. Good hook and smart lyrics, but the beat falls short of genious. <br /> <br />9. Remember Me (feat. RBX, Sticky Fingaz)--Raw and merciless, this is where the MMLP takes a different shape. Underratted, but not quite classic. <br /> <br />10. I'm Back--Not so addictive hook is the major setback to this song. 3rd verse is inspired and classic, but the first two feel extremely half assed.  <br /> <br />11. Marshall Mathers--Without the added symbols, this would have been just average. <br /> <br />12. ken keniff (ICP reference) <br /> <br />13. Drug Ballad--This track kind of slows the album down, but at the same time is the introduction to the final adrenaline kicked half.  <br /> <br />14. Amityville--Best song on the album. The tight beat and 3rd verse alone makes it worth the listen.  <br /> <br />15. B***h Please 2--Classic no matter what way you look at it since Snoop, Dre and Em all collaborated, but if it weren't for that, this would have been trash. <br /> <br />16. Kim--I can't rate this. <br /> <br />17. Under the influence-- Good lines, bad beat. <br /> <br />18. Criminal--This song would have been much better as an opener.

0066620996|4.0|Unlike other reviewers, I don't like to reiterate and summarize the book. To me, that's not the point of a review.    Anyway, I purchased this book after browsing the top-selling books on Amazon. I was unaware of the previous book, Built to Last, and just as oblivious to this one. The blurb was interesting: how and why do companies go from good to great, and why do some of them fail to make that leap? Thus, a large research team was collected to answer those very questions.    Unlike other reviewers, I won't give you the answers: that would spoil your reading experience. However, I will say that the conclusions that were reached were very different from what most people would attribute to the greatness of companies. Unlike most other books of this type which are not backed to the same extent, I believe it would be difficult to suggest that the results are flawed.     My main point of objection with the book was that it only chose 11 good to great companies, along with comparison companies whch failed to become great. Of course, the author gives reasons why this is the case, as it obviously isn't random. Also, companies like BerkshireHathaway, Intel, or WalMart were not included in the study, because they were great throughout and did not have a turning point from good to great. And lastly, the author introduces many new words for concepts. While they are obviously meant to cement the ideas presented, I felt they became annoying after a while. It's as if the author wants to be remembered and associated with these words in some future time. That's just nitpicking, though!    Overall, this was a very interesting read. If you are an entrepreneur, a CEO, or a layperson looking to walk away with a few ideas about the transformation of good companies to great ones, you may want to pick this book up.
B000002UJQ|5.0|this album is amazing. and everyone knows it. i am only reviewing it so i can help get it's rating back up. i saw that it was at 4.5 and i was disgusted. this album surpasses any rating you could ever dream of attaching to it.
1563894696|4.0|Bruce Wayne has managed to make it into the second year of his vigilante career. Gotham City is being plagued by the likes of a powerful crime lord named Carmine Falcone, also known as \\"The Roman.\\" While The Roman is fighting for Underworld control of Gotham against his gangland rival, Salvatore \\"The Boss\\" Maroni, an unidentified murderer is murdering members the Falcone family on different seasons of the year. The number one suspect would be Julian Day (aka \\"Calendar Man\\"), but he's locked away in Arkham Asylum. However, Day seems to know who the killer is.    Calendar Man's knowlegde of the \\"Holiday Murderer\\" draws the attention of Batman and police captain James Gordon, who interrogate the inmate about where \\"Holiday\\" might strike next. The killer might be Sal Maroni, or (much to Batman's dismay), it may even be Bruce Wayne's good friend, Harvey Dent. Dent is the young, newly elected DA of Gotham, and it seems that he'll do anything to keep his vow to help maintain justice in his crime-ridden metropolis. Dent has been trying to take down The Roman's empire for months now.    On the GCPD rooftop, an alliance involving Batman, Captain Gordon, and DA Dent is formed to bring down The Roman. While trying to solve the Holiday mystery and playing a game of \\"Cat and Mouse\\" with Catwoman, Batman must also deal with the dreaded \\"Rogue Villains\\" that are beginning to make names for themselves--Joker, Solomon Grundy, Poison Ivy, Mad Hatter, Scarecrow, and Riddler. When the mystery is solved, the real culprit may surprise you. There may even be more to the good-natured Harvey Dent than even his wife, Gilda, may know.    This book has excellent, dark artwork by Tim Sale, and noirish writing by Jeph Loeb. Though writer Loeb went on to write about other popular superheroes--Spiderman, Superman, Daredevil, Wolverine, and the Hulk--his best work was on Batman. Frank Miller explores the mental, obsessive side of the Batman, whereas Loeb writes about the \\"detective\\" side of the DarkKnight. Loeb writes a long, but captivating mystery that keeps you guessing who the real villain is. Even after the book is finished and placed back on the shelf, you find yourself guessing if the killer was really caught...
B00079HZUM|4.0|Billy Crudup is no doubt one of the finest actors and yet underrated and underused in Hollywood. Stage Beauty is a good period piece that ultimately allows Crudup to deliver a better than Almost Famous performance, and Claire Danes gets to shed off her girly image with a role that is more challenging than her work in Les Miserables. Compare this theater-themed movie to Being Julia, it's not as funny and captivating, but it's certainly sexier and more romantic as it's plot revolves around the unintensional relaionship between a drag actor diva(Crudup) and his dresser(Danes) who secretly wanted to become an actress.<br /><br />At the top of his divadom, Crudup was announced by King Charles/played by the unrecognizable Rupert Everett with bad hair and makeup, that he will no longer be allowed to play female roles, and the women are allowed to become actresses for the first time. Danes becomes the replacement for the female lead in Othello, and Crudup was \\"ostracised\\" when he refused to play male parts. Meanwhile his career and love life all started to fall apart. His secret boyfriend(Ben Chaplin) dumps him and gets married to a woman, because he was only attracted to crudup in drag. Crudup had no idea that Danes had been secretly in love with him despite the fact that she took over his role in the play. From that point on he had to climb back up to reclaim his status as an actor if not actress. During the process of coaching Danes to play the role that he gave up, he rediscovered his true identity and the meaning of being an actor, as well the love and passion for Danes.<br /><br />Billy Crudup's performance was mesmerizing, especially his drag scenes, but I found that his body was a bit too muscular when he was topless. His portrayal of confused sexual and romantic pursuit was  very impressive to the level of the late Leslie Cheung's performance in Farewell My Concubine. Claire Danes had a great deal of chemistry with Crudup, and it was wonderful to watch her love scenes with Crudup, because it was quite funny and beautiful.because it was quite funny and beautiful.
B000067CPX|5.0|I've heard people say that RHCP is selling out and becoming too commercialized, but I'd say this is one of their best CD's. While they may be a little less, well, funky? they're still producing great music. And maybe they'll continue to get more airplay too. It's a departure from their old stuff, but I think they're just getting better. Listen for yourself...
B00005QG9J|5.0|I love this album. All the songs seem to just go together, flowing like the water. It's like they have a dreamy quality to them. Not that they're soft, but I feel like they have that sort of element to them. Favorites are Nice to Know You, Wish You Were Here, but the entire album is great.
B000002LQR|5.0|This has to be my favorite RHCP album. Songs are super hot, sexy and some are even thought provoking. I've been playing this album for years and never tire of it. It's one of the only CD's I own that I can do that with. I'm personally a bigger fan of their newer albums, but I do enjoy their old stuff too. And the fact that they're able to keep mixing things up and making great music no matter what. Especially after all these years. IMO, they seem to get better with age.
B000002MTR|4.0|Some would say this album is a disappointment, but I really liked it. It was refreshing to see them do something different from their other stuff. But I do admit, I still like Blood Sugar Sex Magic's style the best. I'd recommend the album, but I agree, you should keep an open mind.

B00003CX9S|3.0|The Elephant Man tells the story of John Merrick, a severely deformed man who lived around the turn of the century, and was the subject of ridicule and general horror for those who only saw him as a circus freak. However, for those who took the time to get to know him, and saw past his physical oddities, he was a man of gentle compassion, and was as capable of fitting in with society as any other human, but only if society would give him a chance. <br /> <br />As the film begins, John Merrick (John Hurt) is an attraction in a freak show, being labeled as The Terrible Elephant Man. He is treated as an animal by the proprieter of the show, beaten relentlessly in order to perform for the gawkers who come to see his misfortune. The elephant man draws the interest of Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins), who rescues him from the freak show with the intent of studying his condition in a hospital. Treves is surprised to discover that Merrick is actually quite intelligent and is able to read, write, and talk, though he has been so mistreated that he often has difficulty speaking to strangers. <br /> <br />Soon, there are articles in the newspaper describing the elephant man and his condition, and the people who read these articles either respond with compassion or exploitation. Compassion is shown by the stage actress Mrs. Kendal (Anne Bancroft), who is absolutely delighted to find out that Merrick has a love for theater, though he has never attended a live show, due to his condition. A man named Bytes does the exploiting, bringing curious people--usually drunk--to see the elephant man and recoil in terror at his appearance. Meanwhile, while all this attention is being paid to Merrick, Treves wonders whether he has helped the situation any--people are still just as interested in seeing this deformed man, it's just in a less hostile environment--or whether Merrick's situation can be helped at all. <br /> <br />The Elephant Man is based on a true story, and surely the storyhas been embellished with dramatic elements, but regardless, once the film finds its footing, it has some compelling spots. John Hurt does a masterful job in creating a sympathetic character out of a man who is at first glance a monster. Buried beneath a veritable mountain of make-up and masks, Hurt is able to use the restrictions to his advantage, allowing us to see both the physical deformities of this man as well as his struggle to be accepted by society. <br /> <br />Director David Lynch filmed The Elephant Man in beautiful stark black and white--partially because of the make-up, partially because of the period in which the story takes place, and, I think, partially because of the mystery and shadows that black and white allows that cannot be rivaled by color. The message of the story is pretty clear: don't judge a person based on their looks. This is obviously a good message to preach, but I'm not sure if The Elephant Man did all that it could have to convey it.
B000750OEA|5.0|Is this the same as \\"Kylie's Greatest Hits\\"? which I own and is a 5 star collection?
B0007N1AI6|4.0|This is a darned good album.  Despite the comments in some of the negative reviews posted here, the lyrics are several cuts above any of Priest's albums of the last fifteen years, and the musicianship and production on every track of AOR are top notch.  The album doesn't break new ground the way that Sin After Sin or British Steel or Defenders of the Faith did--and, thank gods, it isn't \\"modern\\" like Jugulator or Demolition--but it's eminently listenable, and--also unlike any of the other albums I've just mentioned--there isn't a true clunker song in the bunch.  (The closest thing would be \\"Lochness,\\" with goofy lyrics but excellent music.)  Three tracks, in fact--\\"Revolution,\\" \\"Worth Fighting For\\" and \\"Wheels of Fire\\"--are as memorable songs as anything Priest have done before. <br /> <br />I'll agree with those who say that this album isn't quite as good as Halford's last three solo albums or as impressive as Iron Maiden's comeback, Brave New World, but what could be?  To complain because this album is \\"only\\" one of Priest's very best instead of some kind of truly career-defining masterwork is ridiculous.  Buy the album, listen to it, enjoy it.
B00005JNDZ|1.0|This is complete and utter garbage. Bridgette is a revolting, wanton, fat, stupid woman doing her best to somehow replicate on the silver screen the fatuous feats that one might have done in childhood. The story is pointless. The main character is everything a man hates in a woman; desperate and annoying and wholly lacking any kind of confidence in herself. She says infantile things on the phone to her boyfriend and does all she can to be as outrageously facile as possible in public.  The jokes are stale and any purpose is completely lacking.<br /><br />The film devolves into a series of scenes documenting how irritating she is. One is forced to put up with that tragically common English expression shag' again and again. The `shags' her bloke, her friends and old boyfriends all `shag', and she has `shag flashbacks'. It is all drivel and unbearable dross. She is a modern nightmare. I failed, I guess, to see the point. Is she supposed to be the defiant voice of the disenfranchised women in modern England? If so, it is a voice not worth hearing.<br /><br />I am not sure who would enjoy this. Fat women with no friends who want to feel that other people are even more pathetic than themselves? Perhaps. Do yourself a favour. Put it down and read Cummings or Tennyson or Eliot. Use your mind and try to find the glory that once was England, because it certainly isn't here.
B00000J7SS|5.0|This is an excellent album; I've had it on rotation (on my hard drive) for some time.  Perfect music for anything.  Only one caveat: Amazon has it for $22.99, but iTunes has it for $6.94.  Sorry Amazon - I still love you for books, but my heart has found another for music purchases. <br /> <br />And I guess the only real alliteration came in the review title - sorry.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I'm getting so sick of people giving this album 1 or 2 stars just because they don't think that Green day is punk. I really don't care as long as their music is good which it is. Honestly review the CD not how punk Green Day is. <br />Getting that out of the way, This cd is one of the best albums that i own! It has amazing guitar riffs and lyrics. Some good slow songs are \\"give me novacaine\\" \\"Wake me up when September ends\\" and \\"We are the waiting\\". My favorites are probably \\"Holiday\\" and \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" GREAT GREAT GREAT album!! BUY IT even though its different from Dookie its still great.
B00005U1YO|5.0|if chemical brothers can beat their own efforts with \\"Let forever be,\\" the result would be \\"the test.\\" Ashcroft combines the best of the verve sound with the rocking beats of the chemical brothers. the first three songs are killers as well and the album has an even feel to it making it well worth the price. buy it
B0000DD7LB|5.0|On her fourth album Ms. Britney Spears shows the world that she is not that innocent. On \\"In The Zone\\" she has tooken a different step than what she did on her last 3 albums. This album sounds very different than what she has done in the past. As you listen to the songs you well be able to tell that 2 of the 13 songs on this album is talking about breaking up, while the other song's are talking about partying, having fun, and sex. As you listen you will be able to understand of why they say that little kids shouldn't listen to Britney Spears. There is not one bad song on this album, i like the sound of the song's and the difference than what was on her last 3 albums.    1.) Me Against The Music w/Madonna 5/5  2.) (I Got That) Boom Boom 4/5  3.) Showdown 5/5  4.) Breathe On Me 5/5  5.) Early Mornin' 5/5  6.) Toxic 5/5  7.) Outrageous 5/5  8.) Touch Of My hand 4/5  9.) The Hook Up 4/5  10.) Shadow 5/5  11.) Brave New Girl 5/5  12.) Everytime 5/5  13.) Me Against The Music (Remix) 5/5    This album is yet by far Britney's best album than what she has done in the past. She tell's and show's the world that she not that innocent. She has come along since her \\"... Baby One More Time\\" day's. On this album you can tell that Ms. Britney Spears seems to have found herself in life and that she is not a perfect person and that she has her faults just like the rest of us. She is one of the worlds most talented singers. She is the \\"Princess of Pop.\\"
0316172324|3.0|Gladwell, following up on his big literary hit, \\"The Tipping Point,\\" cranked out another interesting life/leadership/decision making book in \\"Blink.\\"  The premise is pretty simple, go with your gut, and heart, before you go with your head.  He gives example after example of research that shows your instinctive reaction is better than your thought out response.  I agree, but also have known this since 2nd grade when our teachers told us to go with the first answer that we put down.<br /><br />Gladwell rightly also makes the point that these gut decisions can be patently wrong as well, getting into race relations and gender among other topics.  The book kind of fades at the end after a strong start.  Probably could have been 50 pages shorter.  Anyway, you will enjoy most of this book - Joseph Dworak
B0002XDODU|5.0|Five stars does NOT justify any Rammstein album. they just keep out doing them selves with each album! The first time I listen to Rammstein was with the song Feuer Frei! on Triple-X album and I as in love. Then a friend of mine burned all their CDs for me and I haven't listend to anything else since. This is actually the second longest Rammstein album, but it doenst seem that way because of the way all the songs seem to go into each other. <br /> <br />Reise Reise-10/10. When I first put the CD into my computer all I heard was a bunch of wierd noises, but realized this was a special feature that is avalible on the German version, but it has to be rewound and was dissapointed that it was not the same for the American version. What your hearing is a flight recorder. On to the song. WOW!!! I love the Acordion at the end, and the haunting chorus. Till has the lowest voice of anyone I have ever heard, and he can sing great. <br /> <br />Mein Teil-10/10. I kind wore this one out listening to it on the Resident Evil: Apocolyps sound track, but I was able to get back into it. It more or less tells the story of the victim of a German Cannable. The Choir at the end is amazing, and the guitar solo is almost scary. Add Tills whisper and the snare drum in the background and you have a very dark song that is DEFINTLY Rammstein. <br /> <br />Dhali Lama-10/10. This is a very cool song. It tells the tale of a man and his child that get on a plane, but the father is afraid to fly, and in the end, he suffocates his son. It is based on a poem by Goethe, and the fact that the current Dhali Lama is also afraid to fly. It is slow, and somewhat haunting, and the sung chorus adds to it. <br /> <br />Keine Lust-10/10. Dhali Lama gives straight into this song, so it starts slow, but then you hear the thrashing guitar, and Till saying \\"Ich Hab' keine lust\\" (Literaly \\" I have no desire, or I dont feel like it) and how he doesn't want to do different things. The 'Mir ist Kalt' in the middle is somewhat reminiscant of Seeman from the Herzeleid album. <br /> <br />Los-10/10 Woah. Thats all I could say when I was done listening to this song. It takes Rammstein to a whole new level. The acustic guitar is a new thing for Rammstein, and I LOVE IT! It is very blusy, but it still has Tills deep resounding voice to back it up. A very different, but still very cool song. <br /> <br />Amerika-10/10. Contrary to what you might have been lead to believe, this song is not bashing on our beloved country. it more or less talks about how America is taking over the world with McDonalds, Nike shoes and all that good stuff (thats not in the translation. If you see the music video, you'll get it) The \\"coca cola, wonderbra\\" part is funny as hell. Add a kickin' guitar solo this makes for a great song..... <br /> <br />Moskau-10/10...that leads into this one. It talks about Moscow Russia, and it has a girl (NOT the girls from TATU. I looked it up in Lyrics book that came with the CD, and Its not them) singing the chorus in Russian, and it sounds awesome next to Tills German. The Acordion solo in the middle is really kool, and adds another interesting element, not just to Rammstein, but to Metal music everywhere. (How often does Industrial Metal use an accordion?) <br /> <br />Morgenstern-10/10. This is reminiscant of \\"Sonne\\" from the Mutter Album. (which I mantain to be one of Rammsteins best songs ever). The choir is an amazing contrast to the heavy guitars, and if you listen and the end of the song you can hear sort of a wailing sound that is awesome, and I think it adds a litte punch to the song. <br /> <br />Stein um Stein-10/10. It took me a litte while to get used to this song, but in the end, it is defenitly a Rammstein song, with Till screaming at the top of his lungs durng the chorus. The creepy sounding intro and verses add to it, and the guitar solo is amazingly wicked. <br /> <br />Onhe Dich-10/10. Ahh, the ballad. slow, sad, haunting. You can see him lost in the woods looking for someone. This is beautifly sung. <br /> <br />Amour-10/10. A slower song that doenst quite quallify for a ballad, but its still very kool. It compairs love to an animal. The keyboard solo is great, and it gets heavy enough at the end that your not disapointed (Not that I would have been otherwise). A great way to end the album.
B000002OZY|5.0|Tommy (1969.), the Who's fourth studio album<br /><br />What we see with the Who's 'Tommy' album is seeing a great band truly discover themselves and at the same time create something utterly groundbraking, the rock opera concept album. Before 'Tommy', the Who were a good, quite successful band who had put together 3 good albums, most chiefly their 1967 'Who Sell Out' release and had produced some memorable classic tracks such as 'My Generation', 'I Can See For Miles' and 'Pictures of Lily'. However, 'Tommy', the Who's fourth studio album, released in 1969 saw the band take things to a new conceptual level which would elevate them into a very much unique place in rock, as the pioneers of the rock opera. From here, the Who, personally one of my favourite bands never looked back and went from strength to strength with subsequent albums. 'Tommy' might not be my favourite work by the Who - 'Who's Next' claims that honour in my mind - but it is up their with their best efforts and deserves all the respect it gets for the new style and trends it set in rock.<br /><br />So why all the hype about Tommy? Pete Townshend is simply a genius songwriter and it was probably only him at the time who had the intellectual nous to comem up with the idea of taking a story and put it to music in a rock fashion. 'Tommy' is one spectacular, enthralling and captivating journey. The story builds up around a boy, funnily enough called Tommy (....!) who is deaf, dumb and blind and it is about his life, his abilities and his subsequent curing from these disabilities. The focus and style of the story is almost something of myth but also incorporates the theme of the struggles of life, something which Townshend really really shows in his later songwriting for the Who. The work was a gamble at the time as something like this had never really been done before (elements of rock opera can be seen with the radio station theme of 'Who Sell Out') and so it was very ambitious for the time and the fact it sold so well (reaching #2 in the UK and #4 in the US) was a job really well done for the Who and a well deserved success. The fact that the album was over 70 minutes long, extending it into double album length on LP further enhances the ambitiouness of the album, as double albums were seldom seen at the time. This is why it deserves all of the praise it gets - it is innovation, clever and in parts highly emotive music all rolled into one!<br /><br />Therefore, with 'Tommy', prepare for an amazing journey. The brilliant lavish cover says it all really - the doves on the front cover give that feeling of expectancy of what is contained within and I hope it gives prospective listeners the incentive to buy or copy this album.... oops, i shouldn't really promote CD rewriting!! But that aside, you get with Tommy 24 tracks which all link very clevely together to give a feature length story. 'Tommy' has very much the typical Who style to it in much of its approach. Keith Moon's often jawdropping drumming is here and keeps the album ticking along as does John Entwhistles ever present thick bass lines (listen out for his French Horn playing on the Overture also). Townshend's guitar playing is excellent on the album, as is Daltrey's vocals. The Who were becoming much more the complete unit by the time of Tommy. Their approach was much much more professional in their studio album recording compared to their earlier albums in the days when they had a big mod following. As extras, it is certainly worthwhile looking out for any live Who performances of this work - they often did it on tour immaculately (check out the 'Live at Leeds' deluxe edition which has a 1970 performance of Tommy.)<br /><br />The album has some great standout tracks. 'Pinball Wizard' is perhaps the most well known track but is not the best by far on the album (in the story it turns out Tommy has a god like talent for playing pinball). Overture is a great opener - obviously punning on the opera idea as is the10 minute 'Underture' which has some great riffs in its instrumental make up. 'Sally Simpson' is a great track and is followed by 'I'm Free' a real classic and captures the essesnce of the story brilliantly. 'Were Not Gonna Take' is is an excellent ballad style finish to the album. This is just to name but a few - 'Sparks' and '1921' also deserve a special mention too.<br /><br />Overall, Tommy is an enthralling listen - I would always recommend listening to it from start to finish so you can appreciate the tracks in context of the story as it gives the songs in the work more meaning. As I've mentioned, this was really the start of something truly great for the Who. They would continue to get better and would later try their hand in another rock opera with 'Quadrophenia' an excellent if less accessible Townshend innovation. 'Tommy' is a timeless classic and laid the concept of the rock opera, an idea which a number of other bands in later years would try. Never ignore 'Tommy' and certainly not the Who, theyv'e pionerred too much in rock to ever be forgotten, there will never be a band like them again.some great riffs in its instrumental make up.

B00005RHGL|5.0|I am only just really a kid and all I have to say is that I love this movie!. Val Kilmer is now a major crush on my list an has proven to be one of the best unrated actors in the job. His acting as Doc should have won him a Oscar. i have never seen anyone take a character and make it their own. All the actors did a great job making their cahracters come alive. But out of all of them Val did the best. The story was very good and the director's cut is great, showing parts that should have been the first one. Over all one of the best Western movies ever made, even better than Dances with Wolves!
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|Not a bad album although I wouldn't call it one of the best in my collection.I must admit their looks and attitude are better than their music.Most of the songs are good but sometimes they sound monotonous.Reptilia is one of the best rock songs I've ever listened to.Other tracks like What Ever Happened, The End Has No End, 12:51 and Automatic Stop will make you wanna push the rewind button again and again.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This IS one of the best movies ever made.  My favorite lynch movie.  I have seen a ll of lynch's work, and this is my favorite.  I didn't like it my first couple times watching it because I was totally lost.  Do a little research online before you watch it and make any judgements on it.  Research what the movie is actually about.  There is a tangable storyline, you just have to look hard and \\"out of the box\\" to notice it.  Anyways, deffinately a great film, it's sad to see such poor reviews on this movie.
B00007GZR5|3.0|Oscar winning special effects buoy this adaptation of Richard Matheson's novel.  There are some startling effects and the use of light and color are breathtaking.  Michael Kamen's score is also lush and wonderful.  The movie, however, is definitely a mixed bag.  Starting off with enough tragedy to induce suicidal tendencies, WHAT DREAMS MAY COME offers us a view of the afterlife; it does reaffirm the power of love, but it also whitewashes the suicide issue, and its reincarnation ending is just too over the top for my personal tastes.  I also think the casting of Cuba Gooding Jr. was a big mistake; when we find out who he is, it's hard to really believe it.  Robin Williams is certainly more subdued than usual, but I couldn't help feeling his performance was more of a \\"hey look at the comic actor playing a dramatic role.\\"  Annabella Sciorra fares much better, showing us the descent of her character and her \\"redemption.\\"  Max von Sydow's role could have been played by any numerous character actors, but his presence also lends a sort of legitimacy to the movie.  I found the movie to be too manipulative to really be \\"touching\\", but I am in awe of the beautiful visual effects.
B000062YAZ|1.0|It should first be established that this is not even music PERIOD, this is a ludicrous bedlam of tactless, senseless, depraved, vile, indiscernible, untalented racket that anybody could do by concentrating as much noise as possible together and then adding screaming shouts. This is about as bad as Cannibal Corpse. <br /> <br />Anybody that recommends this travesty of music has SERIOUS problems on all echelons of their sanity!  <br /> <br />Nobody in their right mind would give this a good rating. In fact. Even if the lyrics weren't so bad, more enjoyment can come from hearing construction work than this LUNACY. Take my advice, don't listen to anyone giving this 5 stars, because their musical tastes are SERIOUSLY WARPED.  <br /> <br />This has another name \\"the music from hell\\". It's not even worth checking out. And if you happen to, you'll regret it.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I just watched the whole concert on PBS. Oh, my God! What a beautyful songs, and what a beautiful ladies with wonderful voices. You Irish people should be listening to your songs more often, and paying more attention to your culture than fighting and killing each other off!!! Screw the religous differences, we're all God's children! Just listen to your music and take care of your women, for crying out loud.
0765301598|4.0|[...] This trilogy has been an excellant read. These books are also increadibly imagninative and thorogh in explaining how the houses started, evolved, and interacted with each other. Not only is the story of the war of the machines entertaining, the character's are also well developed and interesting, even thought provoking. Without a doubt, these two guys have done an excellant job of continueing Frank Herbert's work, with probably more imagination and creativety than Frank could have produced. It's always difficult to follow a master, especially one of Frank Herbert's calibar and place in Science Fiction history; so I am not surprised the \\"purest\\" of his work would find fault or be disatisfied with ANYONE'S attempt at continuing in his footsteps. On the contrary, his son, Brian, and Keven Anerson have hit the mark, if not exceeded it! I have thoroghly enjoyed thier collaboration on ALL of the Dune books and I pray they don't stop!
B00005JNDZ|3.0|For crying out loud. Bridget Jones and Mark Darcy? I'm not professional but I'd say this relationship is absolutely doomed. How can he stand her? \\"Must be something inside\\", as Adam Ant said (oh, look it up. It's an '80's reference). Anyway, I enjoyed this silly movie because even though it's a movie, it gives me comfort to see that there is someone out there who is even more lame socially than me. OK so the story: Bridget (Rene Zellweger) gets doubts about Mark (Colin Firth) when she hears about/sees the lovely young thing he's suddenly hanging around with. Complexities ensue from a lack of honesty between these two hideously mismatched people. Bridget ends up in Thailand with the much more suitable Daniel Cleaver (played by slighlty worn but still sexy Hugh Grant). I mean, this guy makes her laugh. Anyway,the whole thing is about as edifying as last week's \\"People\\" magazine but hold the same shameful pleasure.
B0006GAI6Y|4.0|Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon, and Jennifer Lopez are among the star- studded cast of this movie about a guy who is entering a mid- life crisis. He is bored with his average existence and wants some excitement. He eyes a young lass and seems to be thinking about having an affair. The woman is an instructor at a dance school and Gere's character enrolls. He quickly discovers how much he likes dancing and in the end, his mind fades from a guy thinking about cheating to a man who realizes that he actually has things very good with his own family and relationships.<br /><br />Richard Gere's crisis in the film is something that many men in this age group can probably relate to. Gere is very genuine in this movie. He means no harm to anyone, even though his wife starts to get suspicious about his disappearances each evening. He is just a man who is tired of the same old routine every day. He craves excitement, and he finds it when he signs up for the dance class.<br /><br />Besides Gere, I also liked the performance by Stanley Tucci. He plays Gere's dual- natured friend who has been living a life of disguise. He is really good at dancing, but he wears a wig when he attends dances so that no one will recognize him. I liked the way Tucci was able to pull this off. He was equally convincing as both a serious businessman and a guy who enjoys letting loose on the dance floor.<br /><br />This movie is serious at times, funny at others, and romantic at its core. Some good one- liners pop up throughout, but the movie is more serious than anything else. I found it entertaining overall, and I recommend giving it a viewing if you get the chance. It will touch everyone in a different way and it's the type of film most anyone will enjoy.
B0001Z52RU|1.0|There are great horror films (Psycho); there are some that approach greatness (Signs) and there are others that are bad, but so cheerfully not taking themselves too seriously that the audience doesn't mind going along for the ride (the first Friday <br />the 13th comes to mind, maybe 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\").  Then there is another category: Laughably Bad Movie Masquerading as Important Cinema. \\"The Butterfly Effect\\" is the last category.  It starts off with a pompous quotation on Chaos Theory, just so we know that there will be physicists, psychologists and other 'experts' pontificating on Chaos Theory & the Importance of this Movie  later on in the bonus material.     <br /> <br />I'd have to sum it up as 'Stand By Me Meets It's a Wonderful Life on Elm Street\\".  Holes abound in the movie's own internal logic, and the biggest one of all is the basic premise:  If Evan, the main character, blacks out at crucial moments, how is keeping a journal going to help him reconstruct his memory, since he is only able to record in his notebook what he's able to remember up to the traumatic event, which, of course, he's totally blacked out?  His character's memory sure receives a lot of assistance from half-written & scribbled out pages.  Even if you're able to accept the basic premise, which is a real stretch, this Chaos Theory, which states that a butterfly flapping its wings can start a hurricane over on the other side of the world. The scope of Evan's chaos is pathetically small--him and his three friends & their unfortunate parents.  The major difference in Evan's alternative realities seems to be that sometimes he's a successful, popular college student in a fraternity & sometimes he's a moody loner with an obese Goth roommate.  I can't help thinking that if Chaos Theory is real, its ramifications might be a bit . . .larger than what happens to a few self-involved college kids.  The special effects that signal Evan's transition between worlds are laughable--it looks likesomeone was shooting on a Super8 camera and just shakes it really hard at intermittent intervals. <br /> <br />I confess that I rented this movie to see what Ashton Kutcher has that is compelling enough to attract Demi Moore, and I confess that I am mostly unable to see it.  Ashton's cute enough, especially clean-shaven, and I certainly hope for his sake that he never winds up in prison for real, like he did in one of these scenarios in the movie.  Sometimes he appears to be wearing lipstick.  Either that, or he's got the naturally reddest lips I've ever seen on a girl, never mind a boy.  But can the boy ACT?  Um.  Roger Ebert put it diplomatically in his review when he said that Mr. Kutcher 'does what is required of him' by the script.  What, like . .breathe while walking at the same time and recite lines?  Yes, he can do that. <br /> <br />The four protaganists are played by three sets of actors at various ages . . .7, 14 & 21.  The young actors playing the teens act circles around their older counterparts & they do some good work depicting adolescence in hell.  I've always had a soft spot for Eric Stolz, and it pains me to see him here, criminally wasted in a tiny role as Evan's friends' pedophilic father.  Dude, if you're gonna play a pedophile, at least make it a meaty role in a quality film.  Go see 'The Woodsman' for pointers. <br /> <br />If you do buy this DVD (which I don't recommend), be sure to watch the Director's Cut first.  An early scene in the movie only makes any kind of 'sense' (notice the quotations) in light of that ending.  The theatrical release on the flip side of the disc has an altered ending to be 'happier', but contradicts virtually everything that's gone on in the endless 2 hours before.  It doesn't really matter . . .either way, you are left at the end credits going \\"Wha . . . . .?????!
B00005JN0T|3.0|Set in 2035 in the city of Chicago, this futuristic movie stars Will Smith as a policeman/private detective who is assigned the task of figuring out who murdered a man at the local robotic factory. Robots are the central characters in this film, and they are shown walking among the people, helping with tasks, and working to fight crime.<br /><br />Will Smith's character John Spooner doesn't trust these robots at all and he is suspicious that one of them is responsible for killing the man at the factory. He sets out to prove his point, with gun in hand, attempting to first intimidate the robots into confessing the truth and then firing away when he is convinced he has figured out which hunk of metal is responsible for this crime.<br /><br />This movie might seem a little far- fetched, but the central message is something to ponder. With technology advancing further and further every day, there could come a time when artificial intelligence is capable of having a mind of its own, so to speak. It could reach a point where these robots start to act in ways they are not programmed to act. And if this happens, it is difficult to say what problems will occur next. Besides committing murder, these independent beings could wreck havoc on the nation and the world.<br /><br />The best part of this movie is the special effects. The director does a very good job making these metallic figures walk, talk, and act like people. Even though you know you are watching a robot on the screen, it seems very real. You feel like an actual person with its own, thinking, rational mind is behind that metal mask.<br /><br />Some humor is tossed in from time to time to keep this movie from getting too serious, but this science- fiction drama deals with a serious issue that is worth thinking about. I don't know if the year 2035 will bring with it the types of advances portrayed in this movie. But the fact is that artificial intelligence could very well become a problem if advancements go too far. And this movie effectively shows what could happen if this prediction comes to pass.And this movie effectively shows what could happen if this prediction comes to pass.
B0002IVN9W|3.0|(3.5 stars to this album-- why can't Amazon give out half stars?) I might be missing something. Is Funeral a good album? Certainly. I've never really heard anything like it before. Would I sell all my belongings and become a groupie for Arcade Fire? No, not quite. There is rather a lot to like about this album, so I'll discuss that first. It's quite catchy and, as I mentioned before, utterly unique. It's hard to pinpoint influences, which makes Arcade Fire stand out in a day and age when derivative bands are all over the charts (not that derivative bands are a bad thing-- if they can take something old and successfully make it new again, more power to you, but I digress). The male lead singer sounds like his voice is going to, at any moment, careen out of control, never to return, which is fun. The album's concept is fabulous, with the five neighborhood songs interrupted by \\"Une Annee Sans Lumiere,\\" and the lyrics are (for the most part, but I'll get to that in a bit) quite impressive-- the metaphors in \\"In the Backseat,\\" for instance, are stunning. I find myself playing \\"Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)\\" over and over again-- this may be one of the best songs of the year. \\"Wake Up\\" is also superb, although everytime I hear the intro, I think of \\"Taking Care of Business\\" (this is not a good thing, folks). Now the bad: the lyrics and melodies are sometimes less than fresh sounding. \\"If you still want me/ please forgive me/ The crown of love/ has fallen from me\\"? Ugh. \\"Neighborhood #4 (7 Kettles)\\" is, on the whole, cringeworthy, from its lyric, \\"They say a watched pot/ never boils\\" to its predictible, boring, and schmaltzy chord progression. I can't quite like \\"Rebellion (Lies)\\" either because of its irritating \\"call and answer\\" chorus-- again, not very fresh sounding. <br />All in all, quite a good album, especially for a debut, but it is flawed, which prevents me from giving it anything close to a perfect rating. Take all the rave reviews with a grain of salt, and by all means, buy the album. Just don't expect it to be the Second Coming.
B0002OERI0|2.0|Is there anyone over thirty amongst those giving this pathetic album these 4 and 5 star reviews? Because it's obvious that so many of those praising this album have no historical point of reference. If you think this is \\"punk\\" music in any way, then I have an Ashley Simpson album to sell you! Green Day is to punk what Poison is to metal, although I don't think even Poison actually thought they were legitimate metal, but Green Day does seem to actually think it's a punk band! Hilarious. These boys are the P.T. Barnum of the current music scene and serve as a perfect example of how confused and superficial the young, modern day music consumer has become. Boy has the music buying public degenerated since the days of The Clash, Black Flag, Dead Kennedys, The Buzzcocks, etc.! I know that was a long time ago. Feel free to call me an ol' fart. But at least 20-25 years ago there weren't bands at the top of the charts convincing millions of record buyers that they were Elvis, The Beatles, or Miles Davis! But somehow these \\"American Meatheads\\" (read: spoiled brats) have convinced huge numbers of people that they're \\"punk,\\" and have some sort of fresh, new message of rebellion. Truly juvenile mantras like \\"Down with Bush!\\" and the wearing of combat boots and mascara isn't punk kids. It's called being a lemming! <br /> <br />Two stars instead of one because I honestly think they can play and have the occassional ability to write a POP song.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|SAW has got to be one of the most underappreciated films to come out in theaters last year and I decided to rent this film last night and let me tell you something, this film is probably one of the most entertaining films I've seen in 05' and first time directer Wan' did a superb job making a film, which only took them 2 weeks to make.  AS FOR ACTING, yes it's not that great but not bad either....I thought Dr. Larwence ruined it with his acting.  Other then that this film was really, really awesome.   <br /> <br />People need to understand that this film was originally(suprisingly true!!)going to be a \\"DIRECT to Dvd and VHS film\\" but since it was praised by so many fans at those film festivals, they decided to put the film in theaters(sadly it was only in limited theaters in U.S).  Obviously the Director wanted it to go wide in theaters so he had to \\"butcher\\" the NC-17 raing so he could get his R rating.  Still this film is so highly enjoyable, especially for fans of the movie Se7ven.   <br /> <br />SAW is a great film, not so great acting, great twist(oh my oh my who saw that coming)though it's a bit flawed and I'm not going to explain why, just go on forums and you'll see.  Sadly SAW leaves you hanging with abunch of questions and even worse, SAW2 is already in the works and it's being directed by a different person so I already get that feeling that the sequal will have NOTHING to do with SAW1....Oh well... <br /> <br />Go check out SAW....It's a really great film... <br /> <br />4.0 out of 5 stars
078681859X|5.0|A great fantasy read.<br /><br />Anyone who has read and enjoyed J. K. Rowling's \\"Harry Potter\\" series will be pleased with this offering by Jonathon Stroud. The setting is in modern day London and features two initially antagonistic heroes; that being Bartimeaus, (a demon) and Nathaniel (a young apprentice magician)<br /><br />What makes this novel so \\"special\\" is its extremely addictive and fresh story line coupled with an easy to read writing style. It's a \\"I just have to read one more paragraph, one more chapter\\" type of book.<br /><br />The main characters are intriguing; especially Bartimaeus, who has been reluctantly summoned by the novice magician. As you get into this novel he shows his true nature, a cynical sense of humor and condescending attitude to all things (both human and fellow demons alike). His mind is usually preoccupied by one of two thoughts; that being, some sort of revenge towards someone or, more importantly, self preservation (and not necessarily in that order). It's impossible not to like this cunning creature, even with all his sense of righteous indignation.<br /><br />Nathaniel's character, who we initially meet as a young child, develops into an interesting adolescence; replete with all the difficulties and awkwardness of going through this age group. As his relationship develops with Bartimaeus, his magic abilities grow but he still struggles with some youthful immaturity.<br /><br />All in all a superb opening for this trilogy: I loved this book; could hardly wait to find time to get back to it and I'm looking forward to Book II.
0440180295|5.0|Are you insane?  Do you like books about people who are insane?  Because this is the book for you.  It goes through Billy Pilgrim's journey of life including accidents, war, and aliens.  Some of my friends hated it, but it gets better as you go along.  If you like this sort of thing, it's perfect!! <br />
B0007Y08IS|5.0|\\"Team America's\\" brilliance was largely overlooked when it hit theatres last fall, which is somewhat ironic considering that pre-election political controversy turned Michael Moore's similarly themed, but farmore one-sided documentary into a $100 million-plus hit just months earlier.    \\"Team America\\" is an equal opportunity offender.  Scewering everything from republicans to democrats, Hollywood to outspoken, but poorly informed know-it-all, know-nothing movie stars (hey, who asked you?), and bad movies to big-budget bad movies; \\"Team America\\" lets no one off easy.    Did I mention the whole thing is done with puppets?      If I had you on the hook and  hearing that made you forget all the good things I just said, and you are now suddenly asking yourself just how smart and topical an action flick staring all puppets can be, you are probably not alone.  This skepticism is no doubt what kept people away from this movie in theatres.  Its a grown up movie in kids' clothing.  The marketing was probably to blame, but how do you market a puppet movie to grown ups?      Their loss.  The fact is this movie wouldn't have been successful had it been done with actors.  Sure, the script would still rank with the best of the year, but I don't think any real actor could pull any of this off.  The movie's charm lies in watching these string-controled, walking (kind of) and talking (not to mention screwing and killing) parodies of overly macho movie action heros, preachy celebs and opportunistic politicians.  If it wasn't going to be a cartoon, it had to be puppets.  Not to mention some moments are just so outlandish and over the top that an actor, not only would never be capable of doing any of this, but would never be as funny doing it (example: the puppets attempting to point at things or touch one another... God, I'm laughing just thinking about it).    This is really a retread of sorts for creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, since their fans will recognize almost everything here from the humor, to the voices, to the social commentary is all ala \\"South Park.\\"  But just as \\"South Park\\" continues to evolve into something much better and smarter than the one-note joke of vulgar cartoon kids it began as, \\"Team America\\" takes the duo to a far-higher creative level; both in terms of their skill as film makers (some shots are truly breath-taking and well staged; the how-did-they-do-that(with puppets, nonetheless) factor in this movie is huge) and their genius as writers and comics.  Much of this has to be seen (and heard) to be believed.  Even the songs, as in the \\"South Park\\" movie, despite their sometimes vile and vulgar lyrics, can rival anything in a \\"real\\" musical. (\\"Montage,\\" although previously featured on \\"South Park,\\" is a perfect example of the duos writing skills and observational and sarcastic humor.  It's not the funniest or most profane song of the film, but it sums up these guys perfectly.  \\"America, F--k Yeah!\\" perhaps sums up the movie's attitude best:  sarcastic and critical, yet humorous and light-hearted)    Everyone who wrote this movie off as childish and dumb based on the previews is missing out on something much smarter than they could possibly predict, especially if you've been looking for something that calls out all the politicians, soap-boxing celebs who think because they make movies or music the world cares to hear what they have to say (they have the same info. we do, read the same newspapers, what makes them more educated on matters of church and state?), and makers of crapy but expensive movies all at once.      It doesn't take sides, it just tells it like it is.  Many will be offended one moment and be nodding in agreement the next.  And don't get me wrong, \\"Team America\\" is not preachy or too serious.  It is a comedy.  A satire.  And an action flick.  It is just one that happens to include scenes in which Michael Moore is exploded, two characters run through every sexual position imaginable, and the hero pukesfor what feels like five straight minutes.  But they can do that because they are puppets.     This cult-film-in-waiting will do gangbuster business on DVD.  And the idea of an unrated version with extras has fans salivating.    \\"Team America\\" is hands-down the funniest and smartest movie of the year.  It is also a guaranteed pleasent surprise for anyone doubting just how great a puppet movie can be.
B000683VI4|5.0|Very good and you will cry cry cry. James Garner was great.
0375703764|5.0|Many people seem to love this novel or hate it.  That's understandable and I don't like to argue over artistic preference.  It takes all kinds of readers to make the world go round. <br />But there are two things I'd like to point out that not many reviewers have noted.  (Enough have noted that House of Leaves is complex so I'll leave that alone.) <br />(1) This book is unbelievably scary.  If you ignore the sidestories (which I did on my first reading) and read only the main story, it's actually an incredibly frightening \\"haunted house\\" tale with very well-drawn characters.  Watch the way Karen is obviously in love with Navy, but can't let herself be vulnerable enough to show it.  Navy loves Karen, but doesn't understand that his love for her is more important than his need to look into the dark.  These characters are as well done as anything in King (I like King for his characters), and it's only the complexity of Danielewski's novel which obscures this. <br />(2) Danielewski is a beautiful writer.  He could do \\"literary\\" if he wished.  The reason one might not notice that his writing is good is that the typography is so strange, as other reviewers have noted.  Listen to this passage about a man who has just passed away in a documentary film: \\"The aftermath of meaning.  A lifetime finished between the space of two frames.  The dark line where the eye persists in seeing what was never there to begin with.\\"  The fact that this passage occurs over five mostly-blank pages does not mean it is not very well written, and haunting. <br />
0446608955|5.0|Best written book by sparks and have tissues handy. See the movie after, not before.
0671891634|2.0|Not all that useful, really.  Message is \\"buy mutual funds!\\".  In general, since the vast majority of mutual funds underperform the market, just buy index funds would be the best advice.  Most of the text is entirely useless to someone who might want to trade individual stocks.  Passages suggest that if a company seems undervalued you might want to have lunch with the CEO to go over the financials and confirm your valuation.  Oh, thanks Peter, what great advice... (\\"Mr. Gates, your 11 o'clock is here to discuss purchasing 15 shares\\").
0060930187|5.0|This is a great quick read that never gets boring and really gets to you.  At the end you feel that you are going nuts too.  It is really interesting because of Plath's story.  Look her up before you read.  I think this book is mostly directed towards females, so a man might not like it as much.
B0006M4SO6|1.0|Well, I have been a fan for many years and have most of his<br /><br />recorded works. I must say this is very disappointing. The music<br /><br />themes are weak, unlike most of his recordings..Pat needs too<br /><br />take a break, or something, he's running out of Ideas!I don't know<br /><br />if I can get through a second listen to see if I'm missing something....
0451191153|5.0|You will love this book.  It is a hard long read but worth it and never gets boring. The characters are great and really raises questions.
B000002HK4|5.0|Indeed, it's not brilliant to do the covering job. However, I suppose it's okay to do it with the respect of those bands. If they make a album full of covering songs, then shame on DT. Obviously, the selling point of this album is the title track, not those covering ones. Thus, I really enjoy this album as the best of my collection. By the way, DT really should do less covering job after all; it will mop up their brilliance day by day. The recent albums indicate this sign.
B00000DRYI|5.0|Although it was recorded with the same band as Blizzard of Oz, it sounds like 2 different rhythm sections if you compare the two LPs. Of course Randy was still brillant, but it just goes to show what a good producer can do. Song for song this album is so much stronger than Blizzard, it's amazing.  The songwriting, and song structures, everything!!! Not a bad song on the album but the standouts would have to be You Can't Kill Rock and Roll and SATO. Tonight was the ballad of the album and probably the weakest track, but compared to Goodbye To Romance, the ballad off of Blizzard, it smokes. Especially Randy's solos. This review is for the original LP, not this rerecorded stuff I'm hearing about. All I can say to a rerecording of this LP is \\"why?\\". It's as near perfection as Ozzy has ever gotten!!! It's the only (solo)album of his I can listen to all the way through without any disappointments!
0316172324|2.0|I have been a major Malcolm Gladwell fan for years.  But for all of the hype this book has attracted (and that might well be part of the problem), this one doesn't even come close to meeting the standards of his past efforts in terms of the calibre of the research, fresh perspective, new insights and writing.   I have found that much of his work in The New Yorker of late falls short on the same counts.  Perhaps he has forgotten that less is more and that his fans expect him to meet the high bar and standard he set for himself in the past?  Or maybe someone should tell his publisher to stop hounding him for more books that don't make the grade to fill their pipeline?
0783225849|4.0|There had been nothing like it in American movies.  People asked each other where they were when they first saw it just as they later asked where they were when they heard about Kennedy.  The ads & posters said that no one would be seated during the film's final 15 minutes.  Something unheard of to a movie going public who never paid any attention to movie time schedules.  Exhibitors had to sign a contract agreeing to enforce this stricture before they could book the movie.  The Hollywood production code people refused to pass the movie unless a shot of Janet Leigh's belly button was cut.  Hitchcock simply withdrew the film then later resubmitted it saying the offending button had been excised.  (It hadn't.)  The Catholic Legion of Decency which wanted to condemn it, having lost the battle over the public's desire to see with GONE WITH THE WIND, wouldn't make the same mistake twice so gave it a B rating (objectionable in part for all) straight off.  Early critics laughed and said no one would want to see a movie in which the leading lady was killed off in the first 45 minutes.  (The critics' derision was drowned out by the sound of people stampeding to the box office.)  And they commiserated with poor Janet Leigh whose opening scene was in a seedy hotel room where she had just finished having sex with John Gavin & wore nothing but a bra & half slip.  Hitchcock countered these objections by pointing out that if he had made the movie in Europe the leading lady would wear even less & nobody would object because the movie would then be considered an 'art film'.  The movie hinted at homosexuality which Hitchcock always denied.  And even worse it was the first American movie (Hitchcock was very proud of this) to show a toilet.  And he didn't just show a toilet but had Janet Leigh rip up a piece of paper & throw the bits into the toilet then flush the thing.  But the biggest shocker was the infamous shower scene.  Never has film editing made such an impression on an audience.  People thought they saw a lot more of Leigh than they actually did.  (It's here the offending belly button pops up.)  Critics accused Hitchcock of being sadistic toward the audience just as some of his leading ladies said he was to them personally.  Hitchcock protested, wide eyed, that the scene was simply 50 odd bits of celluloid spliced together (you can actually count them if you're not too terrified).  And if the scene's fast editing didn't get to you Bernard Herrmann's shrieking violins did.  (Herrmann's music shrieks have become a music icon like the first 2 bars of Beethoven's 5th Symphony & ON THE BEAUTIFUL BLUE DANUABE.)  Hitchcock spent so much time working out this scene in his head & on story boards that when it came to the shooting he claimed he was bored & let Saul Bass who did the imaginative title sequence do the actual directing.  Joseph Stefano's script (based on a Robert Block novel) is often more than efficient.  The scene between Anthony Perkins (fresh from a successful debut in FRIENDLY PERSUASION which left millions of highschool girls pining for him) and Leigh in the parlor of the motel office is very effective.  Stefano catches some of the dymanics of child abuse & conveys character & motive through the dialogue.  And who can forget that looming Edward Hooper house?  It's a pity that PSYCHO is more talked about these days than seen.  There still is nothing else quite like it.
B0000640SA|5.0|I hate to see when a good, different, quality, movie is completley over looked at in Hollywood. In the movie \\"Memento\\" starring Guy Pierce, gives a good performance as a man who suffers from a memory disorder in which he can't make new memories after a severe accident with a killer who murdered his wife. Since he cannot make new memories, he has to write all information on photographs. Guy Pierce does not know who his friends or enemies are. He has to rely on his photogrpah notes to catch the murderer. When you first watch the movie you maybe confused like I was, because they play the movie backwards. But in the end it all comes out to a great ending. Infact, I had to watch the movie again to look some parts over. The suspense and intensity is unbelievable. Like I said Guy Pierce gives a good solid performance along with Joey pants, (A friend or a foe). Whats sad is that the movie almost did not go into production. The movie was finished filming around 97' but did not get released in theaters till 2000. It was also played in very select theaters as well. But it still frustrates me when i see a great movie that doesn't get any respect. This is why i hate Hollywood, they pump all these bogus movies up like the sixth sense, the village, and all those other lame thrillers but this one is left in the dust? You wanna see interesting thriller see Memento it won't dissapoint you. As far as the dvd goes, 5 stars as well. The limited edition especially is amazing. Cool artwork and sweet packaging. the menu screens and chapter selections are interesting as well, it gives a good intro to the mood of the movie. The special features are interesting as well, solid commentary, nice behind the scenes, ect. Quality wise, this dvd  won't dissapoint you either, DTS. 5.1 surround sound and a clear crisp transfer. Buy this.....
6305603847|5.0|I thought this Movie was a masterpiece. It has more affect the more druged you may be, it has to be able to hit your mind with its full detail. Otherwise you may not go through to its some what boring corny appearance. This movie is very deep and is a great production. Pink floyd uses a lot of great personification and metaphors. I recommend this movie to any one who greatly appreciates  pink floyd and all its wonder.
B00003CWL6|5.0|What to say?  Everyone else has said it all, Had to add 5 more stars, I basically never watch movies twice & knew ending; 2ndtime had me bawling because they're all so pathetic yet real, maybe 'cause I just made forty (ulp!) so now 'adult' enough to appreciate, beautiful to look at, think about from beginning to end
B00006F2WY|3.0|I have to admit I have very little knowledge of classical music though I do appreciate it at times. This album always intrigued me even before I actually heard it. Being a fan of Purple for many years I had obviously heard of the album and its reputation as a difficult thing for most rock fans to get into. It's definitely worth a purchase only for fans of the band but at a much cheaper price. The legendary Mach II lineup of the band makes its album debut here and while it isn't a true Purple album, each band member gets to shine in his own distinct way. Even Ian Gillan gets to sing a tiny bit during the second movement. This two disc edition is a much more reasonable buy then previous versions may have been due to the inclusion of Purple's warmup set before the concerto, featuring great versions of \\"Hush\\" (the BEST version), \\"Wring That Neck\\" and possibly the world premier of \\"Child In Time\\" although I'm not as crazy with this version as the 'Made In Japan' (could be my favorite DP song of all-time live or studio). Not for metal fans but for curious Purple fans only. Purple, 1969, Royal Albert Hall and an Orchestra, it doesn't get classier than that. Pretty ironic that their next album would be the absolutely devastating 'In Rock\\"!! No Malcolm Arnold here!
078401213X|5.0|I think Aranofsky himself is a genius - he shot such a solid and mature debut film with such a low budget. \\"Pi\\" reminded me \\"Stalker\\" by Andrey Tarkovsky. Similar style with unexpected angles and beautiful BW shots (the tempo in 1979 was much slower), surreal and disturbing atmosphere and even direct parallels - milk poured in the coffee in \\"Pi\\" reminded me the famous ink-in-the-water shot in \\"Stalker\\".  <br />Both films invite you to think further. Would we ever be able to comprehend the laws determining our existence? Could all those patterns and formulas discovered by the scientists ever explain the logic of our lives? Or are they just building blocks, randomly tossed by the nature?  <br />A conclusion we could derive from \\"Pi\\" and other films about scientists and great thinkers is that rational intelligence would not make us happy. So, I've switched off my brain and enjoyed the movie.
B0002S94OS|3.0|The music and songs are incredible but the vocals sound exactly the same throughout the whole album without any fluxuation or variation.  I love screams and growls but the singer just doesnt seem to be all that talented.
0345347951|5.0|I've been reading science-fiction for more than fifty years, and I've never come across a better s-f novel than \\"Childhood's End.\\"  Clarke was at the peak of his considerable powers in 1953, when this book was published, and I don't believe that he or any other writer ever surpassed this effort.  Other reviewers have given very nice summaries of the plot, so I won't repeat what they've said so well.  Instead, I will simply say that \\"Childhood's End\\" is the beautifully written story of the two centuries following the arrival on Earth of the Overlords, a vastly superior (in most ways) race from a planet forty light-years away.  The novel focuses on the lives of individuals as they live in their newly created utopia under the rule of their alien masters.  There is a great deal of action and suspense in this book, along with a feeling of awe for the vastness of the cosmos.  It is just about as engrossing a story as I've ever read, and impossible to forget.
044651652X|2.0|I have never seen the movie, but I don't think I will. As a romance novel fan, this was not really my cup of tea. To me, \\"a pleasant little love story\\" has a happy ending, and doesn't involve denying your feelings for fifteen years. Anyway, it reminded me way too much of The Notebook, which I hated, so I'll be passing this one along with a less than stellar recommendation. If you have a love for the tragic, this one's for you.
B000002HMH|2.0|One star awarded for \\"Until It Sleeps\\", the second for \\"Hero Of The Day\\". The rest of this is an unfocused mess, and I liked \\"King Nothing\\" a lot better when it was called \\"Enter Sandman\\" on the previous album. Actually, this album should get another half star for being worlds better than anything that followed, but that's another story entirely...
B0002234LS|5.0|Great, great movie! I can't tell you anything about the plot because you just must see it for yourself, but I can tell you that it is based on one of Stephen King's books, so it's going to be a thriller. Also, Johnny Depp is an acting god as far as I'm concerned, and he does a great performance in this movie, as in all movies he takes on. He is so believable and real. I totally did not see the end coming, even with all the clues, so I was slammed at the end. See it, it's good. Not sure how this one slipped through the cracks.
0345451325|5.0|wow, I was REALLy surprised by this book...being a fan of the x-box game and its sequel, I really enjoyed this one...some may be surprised that a book based on a video game is as good as this one is....well, what is a video game other than an interactive story? well, not all of them are, but Halo's story is one of the many things that made the first game so great...I knew the source material was there...that the basis for a great book based on the game could be written...I was just surprised that Eric Nylund executed it so well... <br /> <br />for those who aren't into games or haven't played Halo, don't let that keep you from trying this book out..it's great sc-fi, bar none...for those who have played the game, we get to learn what makes the Master Cheif tick and what makes him a complete and utter a** kicker...great stuff!
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|After weeks holding Troy in our possession (ever since Blockbuster came up with that \\"no late fees\\" thing, we've been milkin' it), we finally watched it tonight. <br /> <br />I have to admit, it was better than I thought it would be. It's been a long time since I read The Iliad (and even then I might have sorta skimmed it...), but I remember it was long and sprawling and not very moving. The movie was long and sprawling but it did make an attempt at being moving, which I commend. It gave the characters motivations (which, as I recall, weren't entirely spelled out in The Iliad), and used the good Hollywood details, like Agamemnon stealing Briseis. <br /> <br />That brings me to my one really big problem with the movie though. That supposed \\"romance\\" between Achilles and Briseis? What the crap was that? The worst scene in the whole movie was the one where Briseis was holding the knife against Brad Pitt's neck and suddenly, she's in love with him. Now I know all you English majors are going to go, \\"But hate is so much closer to love than indifference and blah blah blah\\" but I don't care. That scene sucked, and it made their whole romance unbelievable. Poo on the writers for not just making Achilles the big dumb brute he was supposed to be and trying to give him more motivation than \\"kill kill kill\\" and \\"revenge revenge revenge.\\" That's all he really needed anyway. <br /> <br />As a side note, I don't care for Brad Pitt bulked up. I much prefer the skinny Ocean's Eleven version. <br /> <br />Excellent casting on Helen. I'd launch a few ships for her, if not a thousand, and I'm not even a lesbian. <br /> <br />Oh, and best quote from the movie: <br /> <br />\\"Wars are about young men fighting and old men talking,\\" spoken by Odysseus, who had a surprisingly minor role in the movie. <br /> <br />Overall, I was not moved. Yeah, people died, but I didn't much like them anyway, so I didn't really care.
0345442970|3.0|This novel is fairly interesting.  It does get a little slow and plodding at times, but the real reason to read this book is that it sets up Episode I brilliantly.<br /><br />I know many people besides myself who sat through Episode I wondering what the heck was going on with the whole political mumbo-jumbo.  This book gives you all the background you need.  Couple this with \\"Darth Maul,\\" and you can see the genius of Palpatine's plans unfold.<br /><br />Read it because it helps the movies/movie novels make more sense.
0156027321|4.0|I finished Life of Pi the other night. Very good book. It seems that all books I really like have some religious themes in them. It's not odd, really, because I guess that's what most interests me about the human psyche. Religion is such a personal experience, and I'm glad to know that many people are deeply, deeply religious in ways that I would have never understood 5 or 10 years ago. (Thank you, liberal arts school brain-washing mechanism. Because brain-washing is the only way to reverse an initial brain-washing. Ha, anyway.) In the book, the main character is a practicing Hindu, Muslim, and Christian. He sees the beauty in each religion and uses each to connect with God in a different way. One of the main themes in the book is alternate points of view: Hindus, Muslims, Christians, or what constitutes truth. In the end, truth is as subjective as the person telling it. Maybe it's true for you, but it's not true for me. I can't say more without giving away the ending of the novel, but go read it if you have a chance. It really was very good.
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|I loved this movie....watch it often.  I love the soundtrack which is why I ordered it.  First disappointment:  \\"Jump\\" by the Pointer Sisters was in the movie, but by a different artist on the CD.  Also, CHristmas is All Around (remake of an old song) was song by Bill Nighy, not Billy Mack (a fictitious person, a character in the movie)....but that's the way it was listed.  Is it a quality control issue?  Where was the Pointer Sisters rendition of \\"Jump?\\"
B0000242BH|5.0|It's been said before, but it deserves to be said again.
B0007GADZO|4.0|Never expect the same thing for Mr. Vai. Different from anything else Mr. Vai has done. It slightly resembles Ultra Zone but if you're a Vai fan you expected some different and this is it. Great album, great songs, and very interesting to listen to to.
B00006879E|5.0|I've had this album for a year and I can't keep it from finding its way back into my CD player... I need more now!
B0006SNL2K|2.0|I like Vol. 3. But I really dont like what they did with this special edition. We get seven new tracks, they begin with two bad B-sides that were cut from the original for good reason. Then we get the single version of Vermilion, which is a shorter version of the one on the cd. They basicaly cut the guitar solo in half and cut out the last few second of Corey shouting \\"she isn't rea\\"; so pretty much is an inferior version to the actual song. <br /> <br />After that we get the only thing worth listening to, a full length version of Danger-keep away. However, this means that they released an incomplete version of the song on the original... Which if anything degrades the original cd, I dont know why they would release an incomplete version of a song on one of their cd's, but apparantly that is what they did. <br /> <br />Then we get three live tracks from Iowa, not live tracks from Vol. 3, oh no, we get songs played live from their last dvd, the only difference is that we can't see them perform and the quality is worse because its on a cd.  <br /> <br />If you already have the original Volume 3, and if you like it, then I recomend either downloading or borrowing this cd to get the full length version of Danger-keep away. Otherwise this cd isn't worth your time. <br /> <br />15. Don't Get Close       <br />16. Scream       <br />17. Vermilion (Single Mix)       <br />18. Danger-Keep Away (Full Length Version)       <br />19. Disaster Piece (Live)       <br />20. New Abortion (Live)       <br />21. People = Sh*T (Live)
B00008PX8P|5.0|The first movie I bought when I got my VCR was \\"The Song Remains the Same.\\"  And it sucked!  Now, many years later, Jimmy and friends have put together the live Zeppelin footage that we all knew must be out there somewhere.      All the previous reviews tell you what's on here in purely technical terms.  But these DVD's tell a story.  From the launch of the first show at the Royal Albert Hall to the finale at Knebworth you see a band that is evolving through different periods of their career.  The early Bonzo vs. the later Bonzo is, to me, the biggest change over these years.  In the Royal Albert show he is, literally, a wild man.  I can't even begin to imagine what it must have felt like to stand on the stage right in front of him then.  But, unlike so many modern drummers, he sounds soooo good!  All the subtlety of his playing is there.  He is far and away the best rock and roll drummer to ever live.  Now, go to the last show and you see a much more reserved Bonzo....still very loud and extremely powerful.....just not quite the energy of the early years.      As for Page, Plant, and Jones, they undergo changes in their performances over the years but it isn't that exagerated.  Jimmy still screws up just as much at Knebworth as he did at Royal Albert!  Robert perhaps prances a little more toward the middle than at the beginning and the end.  JPJ stays solid the whole way.  It really is interesting to watch the whole series of performances and notice this sort of thing.    The music is excellent the whole way through.....there really isn't a weak spot in the whole thing.  My preference thus far has been for the Royal Albert show.....I just think it's tighter and more \\"together\\" than the rest of the shows.  The crowd is closer and the whole atmosphere is pure electricity.  I guess my next favorite is the Knebworth spot, if for no other reason than you get to see them play some songs off the later albums which I like very much.  Presence has always, to my mind, been one of their best but is just way underrated.  In the Knebworth show they give it it's due and it rocks.  The version of Stairway to Heaven in this set is the best I've ever heard, and is probably the best single moment in the whole thing.  The solo section is absolutely brilliant.  (If you wonder why I would say this you must understand that Page plays it differently on just about every tour they did.)  Come to think of it, the whole set is worth it to hear this one song.    This set is definitely worth the price of admission.  If you've got a big screen TV and an great sound system then you are really in for a treat.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|Just recently I took a moment to look over a few of my reviews and noticed that the majority of my reviews have addressed numerous movies I considered Cant Misses, yet in this I feel the need to warn the public of certain movies that are complete trash not worth watching. The main reason I never took time to write a review about Matrix Revolutions was simply I felt it not worth my or anyone's time to mention. Yet, if you want one here it goes: Throughout the annuls of time and movie production there have been many cult favorites that have spun out a number of movies based on an original idea and concept that took many by storm (i.e., Star Wars, Star Trek, (a number of horror movies with following sequels and Alien). However despite such worthwhile contributions ive always wondered and thought that at some point some producer has either thought or said (and im sure this was Larry Wachowski mindset when making this movie) \\"you know what, i have legions of fans, and i bet i could put out any old piece of crap that would take no more than 15 minutes to write on the can and i still bet id rake in millions (poor suckers) (if you want an example please pick up Star Wars Attack of the Clones or Aliens Resurrection or vs. Predator) However if you are looking for the greatest perpetrator of this crime you will find it In Revolutions. Everyone I knew warned me not to watch this movie but due to my dedication to the first two movies (the first especially) I had to see it if for nothing more than closure. OK i will make this as clear as possible, DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT WATCH this movie, i promise that if you and two friends sit in a room for the better part of 10 minutes you will come up with a better story and i guarantee a  far better ending than what you'll see in Revolutions (but if you are like me and just have to see it for closure rent it or wait for it to come in the five dollar bin at Walmart). I really wish there were words that weren't four letter that I could use todescribe this horrid piece of Crap (whoops that's a four letter word lol). I will give it one star only because that's the lowest I can give and I will say the special effects were pretty good. All this movie relies on is action, explosions, big fancy words, and circular logic, hoping to confuse the viewer, and oh yea i forgot, very well possibly the WORSE most NONSENSICAL ENDING ever put to film. I wont go any farther in regard to how bad it is for I feel I have rambled to long as it is all I will leave you with is yet another warning not to waste money on this despicable plot at taking advantage of the loyal fans of the MATRIX. Don't say you haven't been warned.
B0006IIKS0|5.0|I've been a huge fan of Metallica since 1986.  They have never ceased to impress me!  I don't understand people who say that Metallica has sold out...  I call it \\"growing up\\".  There's life after \\"Master of Puppets\\".  Metallica has never been out to make anyone happy but themselves.  They are who they are, and if you don't like it, they aren't going change just to make you happy.  This is what I love about Metallica.    It is great to see people who aren't afraid to acknowledge their weaknesses, or admit that they're not perfect.  I can seriously identify with that.  Most people are too afraid to allow themselves to become so aware of their imperfections.  People are always trying to blame their problems on someone (or something) else.  With \\"SKoM\\", Metallica has shown the world how they've created their own problems, and how they've chosen to deal with them.  It takes a lot of integrity to open yourself up and lay yourself out on the table like Metallica has here.   If everyone were as honest and bold as Metallica, the world would be a better place.    Watch this movie, and learn what greatness is like!
B000063DI9|5.0|I got into Iron Maiden around the time they released \\"Live After Death\\" which was the live version of the Powerslave tour.  Between the band's incredible talent and Derek Riggs' artwork, it didn't take me long to collect up all their previous albums and several EPs.  Powerslave completely blew me away and I also spent plenty of time listening to Number of the Beast.  A bit later, Somewhere in Time was released and I wasn't disapointed in that one bit.  Then comes Seventh Son.  \\"Well\\", I thought, \\"This is certainly different...I'm not sure if I like it.\\"  I gave it a fair shot, then shelved it for a while in favor of the older albums, but the chorus from The Clairvoyant stuck in my head (Time to live, Time to die, Time to meet your maker), and I ended up pulling it back out an popping it on the turntable.  Due mainly to my laziness, it spent a week or so on my turntable with a couple listens a day and really grew on me.  I don't think any Maiden album will ever top Powerslave in my book, but Seventh Son edged out all the others (including the incredible Number of the Beast) to become my second favorite Maiden album.  I pretty much quit listening to them after Adrian left (post Seventh Son), so I can't say how it compares to their newer stuff, but it is certainly one of the best albums they put out in the \\"First Ten Years\\" era.  Did I mention Derek Riggs' artwork on the gatefold album is just incredible as well?
B000065VB0|5.0|After two albums of exploration, Peter Gabriel finally developed a uniqueness awway from Genesis and settled on a direction-- haunting, paranoid, frightening.  As though some internal torment needed to be exorcised.<br /><br />Usually regarded as Gabriel's best, Peter Gabriel 3 is superb.  Longtime guitarist David Rhodes joins Tony Levin, Larry Fast and Jerry Marotta as the primary backing band on this record, augmented at times by none less than Robert Fripp, Kate Bush, and Phil Collins (back when he was still a drummer).<br /><br />The music starts off dark and haunting, \\"Intruder\\", a first person narrative about breaking into someone's home.  The album maintains this feeling, both from an internal standpoint (\\"No Self-Control\\", \\"I Don't Remember\\") and external (\\"Games Without Frontiers\\", \\"Not One of Us\\").  The material rocks like little else, and its nature suits Gabriel well.  The dark chant of \\"No Self Control\\", the energetic confusion and horror of \\"I Don't Remember\\", the venom in the delivery of \\"Games Without Frontiers\\"... the material inspires Gabriel.  Instrumentally, its filled with odd bursts of guitars and percussion, sometimes wrapping around itself.  Still, as great as these songs are, none of them can begin to compare to what I consider to be Gabriel's greatest song, \\"Family Snapshot\\".  Starting soft and delicate, and building, saxaphone screaming along with Gabriel's voice, the externalized horror of an assassin, climaxing with the moment of assassination, then dribblign into a feeling of loneliness and hopelessness.  It paints a sympathetic picture of a man who is so desparate for attention, he'll kill for it.  As powerful as it is, few moments are as stunning as Gabriel's whimpering \\"Come back mom and dad\\" over a delicate fretless bass.<br /><br />The end of the record takes the aggression out of the introspection, the delicate beauty of \\"Lead a Normal Life\\" and the powerful tribute, \\"Biko\\", similar in feel to \\"Here Comes the Flood\\" off of the thecar album, builds until gaining anthemic power.  \\"Biko\\" also paints the way to the future for Gabriel, with its tribal-esque percussion and chants.<br /><br />This is really superb, one of the best of its genre.  Highly recommended.
B000005ALN|5.0|it really is. i don't know why it's not out in wide release; i stumbled upon my copy at a used cd store and it was $4. what a shame. a bargain for me, yes, but even still...ok, on with the review. <br /> <br />this release grabs me because it is so personal in scope and theme. \\"jesus to a child\\" speakes of an awakening of sorts to a lover. \\"fastlove\\" is the dancefloor one-night-stand song. \\"older\\"-maturity. \\"spinning the wheel\\"-please stop cheating on me cause your ways could kill one of us. \\"the strangest thing\\" and \\"to be forgiven\\" are self-confessionals about the vulnerability of a soul and heart when in love. \\"you will be loved\\" is just plain beautiful. <br /> <br />the music here is slow, not hit-sounding, and so it may be demanding on the listener as it is a far cry from wham! and even the \\"faith\\" cd (think \\"father figure\\" sound-wise and you have it). indeed, i didn't like it at all when i first got it and only got back into it on a what-the-hell-it's-there-let-me-give-it-a-try listen. there is a lot of ethnic influence here as well, notably the tropical sounds of romantic brazil and even some mediterranean influence ('the strangest thing').  <br /> <br />this cd did not leave my player for weeks on end and is in my personal \\"classics\\" area. i hold on to this like it's sacred.
B000065VA1|3.0|After flirting with commercial success through his first several albums and having several modest hits, Peter Gabriel finally broke into the commercial consciousness.   <br /> <br />\\"Security\\" began to open up the fears and paranoias on \\"Peter Gabriel 3\\"-- yeah, it had some of that, but it emphasized the world elements and introduced a somber, reflective side to the dense, dark music on \\"3\\".  And it also introduced a funky, modern sound.  \\"So\\" is really the reconciliation of all of these elements.  Once again supported by guitarist David Rhodes, bassist Tony Levin, and drummer Jerry Marrotta (Larry Fast is, sadly, not to be found on this record), Gabriel augments his old team with drummer Manu Katche and guitarist/producer Daniel Lanois, and several guests, including violinist L. Shankar, drummer Stewart Copeland (of the Police), singers Youssou N'Dour, Kate Bush, and Laurie Anderson, bassist Bill Laswell, and guitarist Nile Rodgers. <br /> <br />The album's opener really displays the new styles here at its best-- \\"Red Rain\\" is a ballad, but it moves, its got an undercurrent of funkiness to it, similarly, \\"Don't Give Up\\" (featuring a duet with Kate Bush), again as a ballad (and a dark one) is bass driven with a funk undercurrent and gospel bridge.  These two are absolutely stunning and unique in music, even to this day.  While \\"Mercy Street\\" is a bit more traditional in its structure, it is another incredible ballad with a stunning vocal harmony arrangement in the chorus.  <br /> <br />The funk elements come out stronger in a couple other (and more famous) album tracks, \\"Sledgehammer\\" and \\"Big Time\\".  Modern, synth-driven in many ways, with incredible bass courtesy of Tony Levin, these two are monsters that arrived on the scene at a perfect time.  My only complaint is that they, like the largely straightahead pop of \\"That Voice Again\\", are a drift, both lyrically and musically from what Gabriel excels at-- taking pain, darkness, other elements of people's lives andmaking them internal and personal.  Look at \\"Don't Give Up\\"-- it sounds like he wrote it about himself, but its about a Depression photograph.  These are great songs, but they're a bit too clean and pop for my tastes. <br /> <br />\\"We Do What We're Told\\" and \\"This is the Picture\\" move closer in the direction of \\"Security\\" or \\"3\\", but seem a bit unnatural given the synth layering on them. <br /> <br />Of course, its the album closer thats the most famous, \\"In Your Eyes\\" is really the strongest demonstration of Gabriel's world music influences on this one, its really a quite nice song, admittedly it was played into the ground for a long time.  Nonethless, years later, I've been able to enjoy it. <br /> <br />Its a decent album.  Gabriel's done better, but this might be the best place to start.  However, for new fans, I'd caution listening closely to the darker material like \\"Mercy Street\\" and \\"Don't Give Up\\" and see how that suits you, its really more in line with Gabriel's other work than the pop songs are.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|i borrowed this from the library and it sat in the pile along with other cds i borrowed. the due date coming up, i listened to them all starting with hers and i could not take it off the player. it didn't feel right to take it off as it felt so reassuring, warm, amd comfortable to hear. every single song has this ethereal glow to it (an 'afterglow', i suppose?) that is perfect for that late night drive (indeed, it accompanied me down a 1AM drive down p.c.h. one night).  <br /> <br />the bigger key to this cd, though, is the lyrics. there is one phrase in each of these songs that will stick with you. \\"how stupid could i be...you're no good for me...but you're the one i see\\"; \\"cause i'm a train wreck waiting to happen\\"; \\"(the) world's on fire/it's more than i can handle\\" (about 9/11). this cd will tug at your heart in one way or another, which makes it perfect for those nights when you put on your candle and listen to the wind and rain outside, tea brewing and cat sleeping in the corner. <br /> <br />thsi is not a \\"hits' collection; it won't grab you like \\"surfacing\\" but i can't recommend this cd enough. this has already gone into my personal \\"classics\\" section.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Just because you are famous doesn't mean you know anything about politics. Come to think of it, just because you sell records doesn't mean you know how to make music either.
B0002858YS|5.0|Another CD I'm addicted to.  Every song with the exception of the last one is good.  My favorite, \\"Jenny Was a Friend of Mine\\" has a terrific bass beat to it (especially while driving to it!).  \\"Somebody Told Me\\" another favorite and \\"On Top\\" nice melodies and lyrics.  This band does sound European, so what if they're from Las Vegas?  Love it!
B000002UJQ|5.0|In 1997, Radiohead released what is possibly their best album OK Computer.  I say that because the band have released some other great albums, however Ok computer is the one that is considered their best by polls and music critics alike.  Ok computer seems to be about the struggle of humans in an ever changing modern world of technology.  This album came out at the right time, as the 1990s were coming to end and a new uncertain future lay ahead.  Ok computer is a moody masterpiece that never really cheers you up but gives the listener hope.  There are so many great songs like \\"Paranoid Android\\" and \\"Karma Police\\" but the whole album needs to be listened to in order to appreciate.  Ok Computer caused such a stir when it was released, that Radiohead had to take a break after endless touring and promotion of the album. This album is an essential to your collection and one of the most daring of modern music. Also checkout the Bends, Kid A, and Hail to the Thief.
B0000DG00B|5.0|The 3 day July 4th 1970 Atlanta Pop Festival, full of superstar acts like Hendrix, Jethro Tull, Ten Years After, Grand Funk Railroad, B.B. King, Mountain, Captain Beefheart, Johnny Winter and Spirit - to a crowd of up to 600,000 - opened and closed with an up and coming local band, the Allman Brothers.... Having only released one album previously (and with the historic Fillmore East Concerts still to come), this was a fresh and powerful debut on their home turf. From the sounds of these two sets they both set the tone for the whole weekend and perhaps stole the show with their lasting impression. The setlist is short and repeats (they didn't have many songs), but the songs are the ones we all know and love. They play mostly bluesy standards and end each show with a great Elizabeth Reed, Whippin Post/Mountain Jam set.<br /><br />In an earlier review for their latest studio recording, Hittin' The Note, I said that was the Brother's best effort (a mature late, second or perhaps third and highest peak). But I stand corrected, THIS was the early and perhaps best peak! I even like this more than the classic (universally acclaimed) Fillmore recordings, perhaps because it sounds new and fresh to me now (35 yrs later), while I have a longer history with the Fillmore album (which is undoubtably classic and solid). But this band was new and fresh and bright and ALIVE. This show seems to burn way hotter, and all the raw and rough edges are welcome (like the rough and tumble rapids of a young and wild river).<br /><br />Hittin' The Note is still great in comparison and one of my favorites, but much so because of shows like this and the history and survival and redemption of this amazing all-American band. This is almost as good as being there (yeah, dream on....)
B0000CDL93|5.0|its \\"Fictionalized\\" version of the Garrison Case with Conspiracy Theories and Alleged Facts mixed in. never the less its a very well done movie which i would consider the american sequel to Rashamon. excellent cast with Tommy Lee Jones being memorable as Clay Shaw. although some of what \\"Deep Throat\\" says is bizarre, some of those theories have been debunked, others are probable. the theme of the movie is always seek the truth. no matter how hard or cold it is. if you people want to read about the Garrison Case read Destiny Betrayed by Jim Deugino and Let Justice Be Done by Bill Davy.
0156027321|5.0|\\"Which story is more true\\" presents a thought-provoking riddle.  The reader learns to identify with both Robert Parker and Pi and finds it difficult to \\"give up\\" that version of 227 day journey after the shipwreck.  <br />     But the reader must pay attention to the red herrings and \\"hidden clues\\" with which the author bombards the reader. Example: The 227 days written as 22/7 is the value of Pi to five decimal places: 3.14159.  His full name, Picine, means \\"fish pond\\" in French. <br />     When the reader begins to question what Yann Martel is telling us, then it gradually penetrates that the Zebra is the injured sailor; that Orange Juice is really Pi's mother and the hyena is the clever but cruel cook, whose knowledge of the sea is the person who helps Pi survive. The 450 pound Bengal tiger is necessary to Pi's ethical and emotional preservation. If he could not have placed the onus on Robert Parker for killing and eating meat and for killing a man (the cook), how could Pi, as a devout Hindu, have survived to become a well-adjusted man and a loving, doting father?   <br />     The essence of the Life of Pi is survival.  On one hand physical survival; on the other, emotional and mental survival.  Martel tells us:  \\"You do what you have to do...\\" <br /> <br />   JenKer1040@aol.com
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is perhaps the most enjoyable book in Science Fiction I have ever read!  It places children as the central characters in the story, and they are the hope for the future!  Of course, these are extraordinary children, with unique talents and abilities.  Orson Scott Card touches the child in all of us with his character named Ender, who is placed in the middle of a struggle for the future of mankind.  Ender is very much a little boy, but he has a great responsiblity placed on his shoulders that he cannot avoid or deny.  He is the best strategist ever! The book is a page turner, and you will be captured within a few chapters.  I ultimately read the entire Ender's saga, as well as the Shadow series immediately following!  Card is an exceptional author, and everyone should read this one.  You will not be disappointed!
B000002H33|5.0|I got this back in the spring of '86 when it first was released.  After the mellow Spanish sounding acoustical intro to \\"Battery\\" you get really kicked in the gut.  WOW!!!  I literally wore the cassette version of this out over the spring and summer of that year. All songs on here are great and have aged very well unlike alot of 80s metal.  Not a big fan of instrumentals but \\"Orion\\" has to be the best instrumental ever.  Hard to pick a favorite track off here but it is probably the title track though \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" is really great too.  James Hetfield's vocals are really eerie on this track.  If you only have one Metallica CD this should be it.
B000683VI4|5.0|A wonderful story of everlasting love that is refreshing in today's society where this is the exception, not the rule. I rarely cry during movies, but this one was so touching and so real that I couldn't help it! Break out the tissues!
B0000636UN|4.0|I don't understand why this CD gets so many negative reviews.  There are alot of catchy songs on here. I can understand how some people may get a litte tired of \\"Soak Up The Sun\\" (although I like it)but there are other good songs on here. \\"Lucky Kid\\" is a great rock song.  \\"Hole in My Pocket\\", \\"Get Over You\\", \\"Only Love\\" these are all great songs.  \\"Weather Channel\\" is really haunting and eerie.  Perfect song to close out the CD.  The only song that really sucks on here is \\"It's So Easy\\".  Uhh!! Pure cheese.  This is not as good as Sheryl's self titled album or \\"Tuesday Night...\\" but IMO is better than the \\"Globe Sessions\\".
0064407667|2.0|Well, I have heard of this book ages ago but i didn't bother getting it because people said it was a pointless read, with a plot that goes nowhere and writing that is, well, not my type.<br /><br />Then the books just kept adding up in the bookstores. The movie went out. I then thought this must be a good book to have with so much buzz and sequels to it. I then bought the first two. I was disappointed.<br /><br />It was such a childish stupid story. I don't understand why poeple bought them. It was nice at first because its quite humorous to see bad things happen again and again. After chapter 3, its kind of tiring. It has no substance and its plot is unrecognizable from all the stupid antics the author put into it. I guess there is no plot.<br /><br />Its not a children's book. Its more like the type to read to toddlers before they sleep because its a stupid book. Stick with Harry Potter. I've read all of them 6 times and I still adore them. tHE SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS SEEM TO BE TRYING TO ATTAIN THE POPULARITY OF THE HARRY POTTER SERIES. TAKE MY WORD FOR IT. THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN. HARRY SPELLBINDS READERS BECAUSE ITS NOT MERELY A CHILDREN'S BOOK. ITS MORE THAN THAT. LEMONY SNICKET'S BOOK IS JUST CRAP NOT EVEN DESERVING TO BE READ BY RETARDED PEOPLE.
B000063DFN|5.0|In my opinion this is Iron Maiden's crowning moment.  I know most fans feel \\"Number of The Beast\\" is there best but I feel the songs on here are so complex that from a musical standpoint this cannot be topped.  I have always loved Steve Harris's bass playing style.  Not many bands where the bass is used almost like an alternate guitar.  \\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" may be 13 minutes but it never gets boring because there are so many time changes it's almost like 3 songs in one.  Great CD.
B000002U82|5.0|Wow, only a kid would dredge up that kind of nonsense and lead you to believe this is a horrible album, while of course he is listening to some boring australian, etc. music in the background. But since he is a kid after all, I will take it as that he has not quite opened up his mind yet to listen to some REAL music, like Pink Floyd. Because that is most certainly the case anyways...so but you know for us real mature adults, we all know for sure that this will always remain to be one of the best albums ever created.   Oh yes and to andrew monk, shut up. You are making yourself sound even more ignorant than you already are. This album is for people with great taste in music and no matter what you say, that's a given fact. Deal with it like a man and stop whining about things you will never understand, like what REAL music really is. These kids giving one star reviews are just losers who have nothing else better to do than to diss this awesome album. Go hit a pillow you poofs, oh yes and I am definitely better and smarter than you. End of story.
B0002F7I9Y|2.0|I'm sorry this is the last of this master's legacy. Much of it is schmaltzy stuff. Seems like it was conceived to cash in on the commercial appeal of these duets than for the artistry of it. Get \\"Ray Charles and Betty Carter/Dedicated to You\\" instead, an enduring classic.
B0007DAZW8|4.0|I buy this album yesterday.  I listened the album yesterday & I have been listen the album all the day. It's a wonderfull rock-dance album. The guitar sampler is amazing. The finest part of this album is the songs with the guitar sampler: Human after all, Robot Rock, Television Rules the nation ( this song contains a lot influence of Kraftwerk band). The worts part of this album are the techno songs, but they aren't bad songs. This are very little diferent like the others. This album is more Kraftwerk style. The first album was more techno & the second was more dance & house. <br />Wich album contains the best of the Daft Punk style. No album is worse nor no is the best one. <br /> <br /> <br />

6304806418|5.0|This is not the film for someone who detests musicals.  It is what's known as a rock opera with very little dialogue in the entire plot (and most of the dialogue is speeches made by Eva or Juan).  Also, as a first time viewer, one may get somewhat confused over what exactly is going on, such as the scene where Eva is asking Magaldi to take her to Buenos Aires.  However as one watches it a second or third time they begin to pick up personality traits of Eva and even more details of her story.    Antonio Banderas' performance as Che Guervare was magnificant though upstaged by Madonna the majority of the time, prevelant in the scene \\"Waltz for Eva and Che\\" and in \\"Goodnight and Thank You\\"  The other principle vocalists were great such as Jimmy Nail (Augustin Magaldi) and Johnathan Pryce (Peron).  The differential in voices for each of this characters makes the viewer want to listen and get lost in what they're saying.    Madonna, managed to be serious in her role, which is different from the roles that she usually plays.  She looked decent in costumes, compared to what she usually wears, and had the diva attitude that made Evita jump off the screen and into the homes of the viewers.  There is a slight irony that comes from Madonna playing Eva in that Eva was a love/hate persona much like Madonna of the current generation.    Everytime the DVD is watch there is more to be gained.  (Oh and if you study Spanish you can pick up vocabulary by putting the Spanish subtitles on.) It never gets old.
B0002M6QLS|3.0|You will be hard pressed to find a comparable movie, and that alone makes this film worth the watch.  Come on, pizza guys on mopeds, German crooks, and a taxi driver hero, with the wackiest car since the back-to-the-future-delorian.  Actually just the pizza guys' parade featuring guys doing flips on scooters is enough to justify watching this film.<br /><br />If you find this watch it.  You will totally flip out.
B00003CXA4|5.0|WOW! That's an understatement to describe this movie. Ben Kingsley is more than amazing. The man is spectacular and he truly deserved the Oscar that he won. He IS Gandhi. Whenever I read or think of Gandhi, I think of Ben's Gandhi for he helps me personify and personalize who Gandhi was by putting on a face on the Mahatma for those of us who would never know him. No movie can of course cover everything about a person, particularly a man as dynamic and mesmerizing as Gandhi but this film comes very close to covering every significant thing that had occurred in his life span. History and biography buffs MUST watch this movie. Richard Attenborough does an amazing job with this movie. The cinematography is beautiful.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Ever since I first heard the hit song \\"Complicated,\\" I knew Avril Lavigne was a girl after my own heart! We both have country roots - as you all know, she tried her hand at country music, but since she failed at it, she went PUNK! And she's really good at the punk scene, too. The second I saw her wearing studded bracelets and ties, I thought, \\"She is such an individual!!\\" And I knew we were sooo destined. Her latest CD has continued her tradition of hardcore punk rock, and leaves me speechless every time I hear her whiny Canadian voice! I read this article about Avril saying how much she hates Hilary Duff because she isn't punk. That's so rad, Avril!!! If Avril hates her, then so do I. I think to myself \\"What would Avril do?\\" before I do ANYTHING!!! So mostly the only thing I do is shop at Hot Topic and get stoned a lot. Avril is the best and I hope to see more great things from her soon!
B00003CY0V|1.0|Someone below noted the cardboard characters--too true.You'll never find a finer example of this than in this dreck.This film is a ludicrous waste of time from top to bottom,from every actor in it to (most especially) any unlucky viewers.    Jackman actually puts in a pretty good performance,considering what crapola he is forced to work with.The rest of the cast,led by Travolta,phones it in.This is probably the worst Travolta performance in his career,and that's saying something.He seems thoroughly bored with the script,and I certainly can't blame him.    This is a candidate for worst major release film ever made.It may not be the worst ever,but I can't think of any more insulting.I felt dirty after viewing it.
0316286850|5.0|I do love makeup. If you love makeup, you probably already know who Kevin Aucoin was (sadly, he is gone now). He was a Michelangelo of makeup! I own this book, and I really love it. It provides great tips on technique and inspiration for new ideas. But it's really for people who just absolutely LOVE makeup -- like me! <br /> <br />If you like this book, I think you'd like a Web site called BeautyRiot. It's free. They have all the same kinds of stuff, but it's updated all the time, which is something you can't get with a book no matter how good it is. Hundreds of celebrity pictures and how-to's for makeup and hair. Fun!
B00006BTCA|5.0|Since rock music comes out of a massive corporate structure, it's inevitable that idiot journalists line up to compare bands with other bands over and over again, telling you what you're listening to.<br /><br />Interpol, to put it simply, does indeed sound like 'post-punk', that early 80s sound embodied by bands like The Psychedelic Furs, Joy Division, Echo and the Bunnymen, etc.  But even with those comparisons of bands that sounded different, it's not enough.<br /><br />Interpol have a minor chord sound here, a bit of a monotone on the vocals and an...urban sound?  I don't know how to describe it.  It does have an early 80s sound, not depressing, but a bit dark, introspective, active when it has to be.  This band has rightly earned their popularity.<br /><br />Overall, a very solid band.  No gimmicks, really.  Even their live shows are simple, lights, some smoke, good songs, solid performances.  Songs of urban disassociation you could say, but not overbearing.  Less repetitive than The Strokes.<br /><br />Highly regarded album for good reason.  People blew up their heads comparing this with their second effort, Antics, claiming not as good, blah blah blah.  Definitely a good effort.  They're young, so whether they change it up or develop along the same lines, who knows?  A top NYC band.
B0007PAMR4|1.0|Kudos to the reviewer below for sharing the timely news about Dune's delay on DVD. There are stories at both TheDigitalBits.com and DVDTimes.com for those who need to know more, but details are sketchy. <br /> <br />News that \\"unofficial sources\\" have told The Digital Bits that the DVD will be delayed \\"several months at least\\" is especially unwelcome, as is the added note that no reason was given. The way it's worded, it sounds more as if the DVD has been cancelled altogether, rather than delayed indefinitely. <br /> <br />The possible reasons are endless: a hassle over music rights; legal wrangles with some of the principle; technical problems involved in compressing all that information (the theatrical cut, a 177-minute extended version, extras, etc., all on a single two-sided disc); unanticipated problems in matching the quality of the video transfer on the extended edition to that of the theatrical version; David Lynch's on-going curse against the film - or all of the above. <br /> <br />It doesn't really matter what the reason is. <br /> <br />Point is, a long-awaited, much-requested DVD is now no longer on the horizon - this, after Universal went to the trouble of announcing an official release date, setting a list price, publishing the cover art and stringing Amazon.com (and Amazon's customers) along for the ride. <br /> <br />Personally, I'm  livid at home video companies that make these grandiose announcements, only to renege on their commitments when it comes time to deliver. <br /> <br />Thanks for nothing, Universal. You may re-announce the title, but forgive me if I don't hold my breath until the DVDs are actually at Amazon's warehouse and ready for shipping. <br /> <br />Oh, by the way - I've just learned that Star Wars: Episode III, Revenge of the Sith is about to be released on DVD. It's coming out on April 1 - before it plays in the movie theatres. <br /> <br />It's going to be in HD-DVD (ie. you can see it  in High-Definition, even if you don't have a High-Definition TV set; it's remarkable technology, you really should check it out). The disc will include 212 minutes of additional footage that won't be seen in the theatre; Michael Jackson's original screen test for the role played by Samuel L. Jackson in Episode I; a hand-signed copy of the script by George Lucas; a signed 8x10 colour glossy by Natalie Portman; a dinner invitation with John Williams; and a weekend, all-expenses paid trip to Tunisia to see Star Wars' desert locations - all for the incredibly low price of $8.99! Honest!  <br />
B0006M4SO6|5.0|This is wonderful record. The purpose here, I think, is not about coming away humming your favorite tune. So it takes a certain frame of mind to join in. I happened to have been listening to Mahler's 10th Symphony (Adagio) by various people (and versions) for the last couple of weeks, therefor my ear was tuned to hearing in more of a collective way rather than for a short hop or two. The first time I listened was a bit exciting but I wondered where the guitar was. Odd since it is all through out. The point is that this has so much going on that there are many ways to connect. Another interviewer reported this as disconnected without the communication he remembers so dearly. Personally, if I was in a rush or was looking for something in particular I could think this to. But I couldn't disagree more. But it depends. I listened to just the last part once in ear phones after eating too much and found it annoying. The next day as I listened I was enthralled. As far as no guitar? There are all kinds of playing in here. Synth. Straight. Noise impressions. And there are all kinds of communication going on. And not just guitar. Wonderful percussion, and Lyle Mays plays all kinds of wonderful things. The harmonica adds a great tone. There is a part with trumpet and guitar dancing like rain drops equally ravishing. Steve Rodby playing bass, supports and provides warmth all his own. There is so much here that it takes a patient state of mind to want to be taken. This is about splashes of color. Radiance. Everyone gets their chance to solo and mingle. I can listen to this repeatedly and every time I hear something new. And I mean completely new. I am a musican. A guitar player. I know after a few days now that this will continue to grow on me. A really great experience. You can split it up in sections which works fine, but if you have the time I think the whole thing in a listening is the best. Like a symphony it helps to get to know it. Pat Metheny is very present here but thegroup shines very brightly both as individuals and as a collective to trully inspire.   Not for a \\"Metheny Purist\\" though. I was in line at a concert once with a person like that. He turned to me and asked me if I'd heard the album (\\"Speaking of Now\\") and I said yea I think its real good and some of the synth in there is great. He moaned and said I hope he doesn't play too much of \\"that\\". Go figure.
B00003CX5P|5.0|:-)<br /><br />I have read the reviews on line here at Amazon.com about \\"Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,\\" some I agree with, others I don't. I remember when this movie was in the theaters, in fact at the theater I was at, I was the very first person in line to purchase my tickets and I purchased two tickets each for the first three showings of this movie for myself and my date. Both she and I agree that this was worthy of the title of \\"Star Wars\\" and we also both agree had Mr. Lucas stayed as writer & executive producer that the movie would have been even better.<br /><br />George Lucas is a great storyteller, creating great characters and a great adventure to watch those characters grow within the film, but he is no director. As I have viewed many of the movies Lucas has directed, from \\"THX 1138,\\" \\"American Graffiti,\\" \\"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,\\" and \\"Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,\\" and it became apparent to me that Lucas is no director as his camera angles are trivial and not very imaginative - much different from the collaboration between he and Steven Spielberg in the \\"Indiana Jones\\" movies. That collaboration really works and I bet had Lucas asked Spielberg to direct his saga he would have agreed - after all Spielberg is directing \\"Indiana Jones 4\\" as he did all the pervious \\"Indiana Jones\\" movies. Still this was a magnificent movie.<br /><br />I would not have used Jake Lloyd, but with Lucas' knowledge of the character Lloyd does manage to pull it off - barely. I was sorry to see Qui-Gon die, however I do see it as being necessary for Obi-Wan to move from Padawan to Jedi Knight, and I was disappointed that Darth Maul was killed off as well though that also was necessary since the focal point of evil is not Darth Maul, but he who becomes the Emperor. I am disturbed however that there is no mention of Yoda being \\"the Jedi Master who instructed me!\\" as Obi-Wan said in \\"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back.\\" Maybe Lucas will make mention of the in \\"Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith\\" as it was slightly eluded to in \\"Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones.\\"<br /><br />I purchased both the VHS and the DVD versions and in the VHS there really is nothing very special that is different, from the theatrical release. The DVD release however not only has deleted scenes, but also has incorporated some extra scenes and extended scenes into the DVD release, however Mr. Lucas if you are reading, a release with certain deleted scenes would be nice to be incorporated into the movie itself, or like the \\"X-Men\\" DVD did, allow people to make the decision to add the deleted scenes by electing to select that option. Scenes that I would like to see included are \\"The Waterfall Sequence,\\" \\"Dawn Before the Race,\\" \\"Anakin's Scuffle with Greedo,\\" and \\"Farewell to Jira.\\"<br /><br />Anyway I have heard the complaints about this movie, however remember this is a prequel and as such it is bound to be less suspenseful as we do know what happens in the end. However what I like most about this movie is that we finally get to see more than just a single Jedi. I also loved the two edged lightsaber and would love to see that show up again in \\"Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith.\\"<br /><br />Jar Jar Binks may be a bit annoying at times, but his character is necessary to this and future chapters of the saga plus he adds a morality message as the Gungans are forced to accept the other race on the planet Naboo in order to work together to defeat a common enemy.<br /><br />I have heard complaints about the virgin birth of Anakin with Christian groups protesting since only Messiah Himself should be from a virgin birth, but what these Christians fail to realize is that Anakin & Shmi Skywalker come from \\"a galaxy far, far away\\" and are not human by our standards but rather are humanoid - a human like species, plus that even here on Earth we have creatures that on a regular basis are born through \\"virgin\\" births, which the scientific community has dubbed asexual reproduction, so why can't an alien from another planet. We see the exterior appearance of this species, not their anatomy. One need only refer to many aliens from other shows that appear human to us to see that what one can conceive can be created in a fictional character. In \\"Doctor Who,\\" one of the oldest sci-fi shows we learn that Gallifreyans, which look completely human, have two hearts, live for hundreds of years and when they die their cells reform to bring them back from the dead. In \\"Star Trek\\" the characters of Guinan and Deanna Troi clearly look human and clearly are not and on \\"Babylon 5\\" the Centauri clearly look human with very bad hair styles (does that mean Padm&eacute; Amidala and her daughter Leia Organa are Centauri?), but they also have two hearts - a primary heart & a secondary heart. There is precedent through many different sci-fi shows that aliens can look human but not be human.<br /><br />Most of the backgrounds were digitally, not physically, made and really made their locations very exotic and the digitized characters were very, very cool. Most of the vehicles though did not have that rustic feel and they did in the original trilogy, these vehicles looked too new for a \\"Star Wars\\" movie. The Trade Federation is a good analogy of how corporations can get out of control, just as the Senate of the Republic does for government. Seeing the Jedi council was cool and how they test for users of the Force and the final battle seen was reminiscent of \\"Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi\\" final battle with the three prong effect of a lightsaber dual, a massive ground war of low tech versus high tech and the space battle against other starships and a powerfully shielded space vessel. And I loved seeing the subtle influence of the Dark Side of the Force in Anakin & Palpatine, and the developing bond between the two.<br /><br />All in all this was a great movie, though I must also admit that all the other \\"Star Wars\\" movies with Anakin/Vader were better than this one (that means that the \\"Ewok\\" movies and cartoon show, the \\"Droids\\" cartoon show and \\"The Star Wars Holiday Special\\" were not as good as this movie.s are born through \\"virgin\\" births, which the scientific community has dubbed asexual reproduction, so why can't an alien from another planet.

0767834739|2.0|From my experience, all sci-fi films need one very important ingredient... and this is ATMOSPHERE. Its the foundation block for all great movies in this genre. From classics like Star Wars to new favourites like The Matrix. They tell not just a story, but also of a world different to the one we reside in. That is the heart of a great sci-fi. Without it, characters, plot, nor action can develop. This is where Resident Evil Apocalypse falls apart. From the beginning we are rushed into an established storyline. It begins with a few words from the narrator, explaining the damage already done... and instantly we are expected to follow the paper-thin characters on their journey to righteousness. Its difficult to really care, when we are given little time to absorb the horror of a city under fire. Scenes flip from one character to another, each with a separate agenda. Everything is robotic, human interaction and emotion is minimal and the impact of armageddon is ignored. Its derivative, ironcially much like a computer game, you get bitten... its game over. That is it. <br /> <br />The influences are all there, simplified, squeazed and chopped together.  <br /> <br />'Dawn of the Dead' a generic town is ravaged by a zombie outbrake shown in a TV report like fashion <br />'28 Days later' she wakes in a deserted hospital <br />'Terminator' dressed in a full leather with a mini gun. <br />'Robo cop' Remembers friend and defies command to KILL          <br />'Tomb Raider' Girl with two guns wrapped around her thigh <br />'Aliens' aliens <br />'Matrix' the action <br />  <br />In the end, it has little originalty, and fails to improve on past formula. Post Viral-Apocalyptic films like Omega Man, Dawn of the dead series and 28 Days Later do a much superior job in creating a world in chaos.. the hysteria, tension, loneliness, despair, humour. That was riveting. <br /> <br />Frankly, I couldnt care less about RACOON city.
B000002AZ8|5.0|Although this album has some throwaway tracks, this is Pearl Jam's last Grunge record. After this record they moved onto different sounds like that on NO CODE. NO CODE is great, but DIFFERENT. A lot of people such as myself were upset at first with Pearl Jam's new direction with albums such as NO CODE and YIELD, but I guess we got over it. I like Pearl Jam's new direction because I am no longer 16 and want to hear grunge. Pearl Jam have evolved. I don't think another TEN type album would be possible. It was a different time period back then. If Nirvana was around they would be making different albums also. I remember people being so excited about a new Pearl Jam record in 1997 hoping it would be like the early 90's all over again. Those days are far gone as Pearl Jam becomes less and less mainstream. However, they are still my one of my favorite bands and awesome to see live. I only wish they had more videos to some of their songs over the years, but hey they make their own decisions for their own reasons.
B000002U9W|5.0|At the time \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" was released in the very early 70's, all had known the band \\"Pink Floyd\\" as creators of Avante-Guarde music. There were some bands you listened to for boogie, like the Stones, and some bands for comraderie and fun, like Crosby, Stills, and Nash. But for thrills and introspection,we listened to bands like Pink Floyd. Every Pink Floyd album was a curiosity, and when Atom Heart was released there was certainly no let down. An extremely strange record with dreamy cow graphics that somehow made the bovines look airy and dignified. The cover somehow inexplicably went along with the orchestrated piece on the first side. In this first suite there are perhaps three heart-wrenching lead guitar solos by, I assume David Gilmore.<br />Towards the ending of the suite, is one of the best \\"noise salads\\" I have ever heard. All coming together at the very end with a triumphant finale.Three of the four remaining tracks are restrained, simple and beautiful. And then there is \\"Alan's psychedelic breakfast\\". This is a humorous and interesting piece that requires concentrated listening.<br /> The fact that the Band memebers now regard this album with disdain is a curiosity. Most likely, they are suffering from some middle-aged angst which has blind-sided their rememberances of creative genius. As an outside observer, I still listen to the album with a twinge of awe and respect. Would it not be cool if a modern composer did a work-over of the first suite? Say Philip Glass with Yo-Yo Ma on cello?
B0006VIE4C|5.0|:-)<br /><br />I have read the reviews on line here at Amazon.com about \\"Star War: Episode IV - A New Hope,\\" some I agree with, others I don't. I was 2-years-old when this movie was released in the theaters so I had to wait till the television & VHS versions to see and remember that which I saw as an infant.<br /><br />Still when I saw the original cut of this movie it was like WOW! The greatest movie ever and I was ecstatic when Lucas re-released it in the theaters. Those who complain about the re-cut of the movie were able to see this movie for the first time in the theater, those my age either do not remember or did not see it, and those younger than I were never given the chance till the re-cut.<br /><br />One person complained that Mos Eisley was ruined in the re-cut because this person said that Lucas changed it from \\"...the furthest planet from the bright center of the universe,\\" to \\"all the hustle and bustle of downtown Manhattan.\\" But this person fails to take in the fact that Luke was referring to Tattoine and that even on our planet we have places that are rather isolated but still have ports or airports that make a portion of it like a booming metropolis.<br /><br />The re-cut was necessary for us in the younger generation after being spoiled by movies like \\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\\" and the \\"Star Trek\\" & \\"Babylon 5\\" TV shows & movies of the late 1980s through the 1990s. I for one am only really disappointed that Lucas decided not to include the original opening scene with Luke seeing the battle from Tattoine and then telling Biggs about it at Tosche Station (Mr. Lucas if you are reading this, this is a big hint for your next touch up).<br /><br />I for one loved the updated scenes and the inclusion of both the Jabba scene and the Greedo shooting first scene - and no it is not the politically correct way of changing the scene as the same critic from before has stated - for if it was a politically correct change Han would have talked Greedo out of situation and the fact that Han had carefully removed his blaster and shot so quickly after Greedo is only indicative of Han trying to beat Greedo to the trigger - in essence both versions are self defense.<br /><br />Nonetheless this movie is what began the Skywalker Family Saga and I whole hardily recommend this movie and also recommend that people watch only the wide screen versions and in a home theater atmosphere to get the most enjoyment out of this modern classic movie.do out of situation and the fact that Han had carefully removed his blaster and shot so quickly after Greedo is only indicative of Han trying to beat Greedo to the trigger - in essence both versions are self defense.  <br /> <br />Nonetheless this movie is what began the Skywalker Family Saga and I whole hardily recommend this movie and also recommend that people watch only the wide screen versions and in a home theater atmosphere to get the most enjoyment out of this modern classic movie.
B0007P3582|2.0|This album sucks. And its gonna sell millions of copies. How telling of American society. Good music is pushed underground while MTV and the music industry shoves this garbage down the throats of those dumb enough to listen. 50 Cent/G-Unit USED TO BE (note the past tense) good. For those unfamiliar with them before \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin\\" and \\"Beg For Mercy\\", G-Unit/50 Cent had some hot underground indi releases. Download \\"God's PLan\\" \\"Power of the Dollar\\" \\"Guess Who's Back\\" and \\"No Mercy, No Fear\\". These have some hot songs on them. Now they suck. They only rap about gettin shot nine times (who cares, be lucky you're alive, dont brag about it), clubs, their cars/rims and how many B****** they can F*** in the span of an hour. The beats are always hot cuz ShadyAftermath s producing, but the lyrics are so pathetic that its almost a crime. 50 needs to move outta that castle he lives in in Connecticut and get back to reality. This music is bulls***. Those looking for truly quality, bangin hip hop/rap should go cop Aasim (HOT!!!), Jae Millz, Styles of Beyond, Swollen Members, Buc Fifty, etc etc. There's still good rap out there, you just gotta go looking for it. MTV/money ruined 50 Cent.

158799190X|5.0|Fooled By Randomness delivers an introductory course on how to live in a random world. Taleb believes the human mind isn't made to understand randomness and that really complex systems operate more or less as if they were random.<br /><br />Taleb wants us to change how we think about risk. He wants us to abandon the attitude that because something's happened before, it'll happen again (e.g. my portfolio will continue going up) or that because something hasn't happened before, it'll never happen (e.g. others traders have gone bust, but I never have and I never will). Taleb chides traders who prefer frequent small gains and tries to explain their behaviour. A trader who makes small profits 4 days out of 5 and a small loss the other day will have a solid record, he will feel good about himself but he will not be prepared for Black Mondays or other financial shocks and he will blow up, to use Taleb's phrase, and disappear.<br /><br />Taleb also wants to debunk the assumption that the bell curve (the Normal distribution) is a good model. He points out that financial disasters like the 1929 crash or Black Monday in 1987 have happened more frequently than the bell curve predicts. Why then, he asks, do risk managers still stick with Normal models? These models have failed to predict large movements and are dangerous.<br /><br />Taleb does not take credit for the views he presents and he gratefully acknowledges debts to a range of thinkers from Montaigne to Popper to Mandelbrot. But a good teacher is hard to find and we should be grateful for someone like Taleb. The ideas here are not original, but Fooled by Randomness presents them forcefully and dramatically.
B0007DAZW8|4.0|I had to write this just because of the ridiculous reviews that were up... the album is great! <br /> <br />Of course it 'is not as funky' because Daft has evolved their style, and is once again ahead of the game, and are probably waiting for dozens of poser dj's to come forth and copy yet another album.  Of course the loops are 'repetitive' and samples are mish-moshed 'sounding like going through a radio dial' (I am quoting other reviews on this site) because that IS DAFT's style, and they are artists, and they are progessive. <br /> <br />If you judge this type of music on the surface, then it is obviously not for you. <br /> <br />I give \\"human after all\\" 4/5 stars, because it is hot, but possibly could be even better I would imagine.  Still, a must buy for fans of dance, indie, or progressive music and art of any kind.
B0001XAS1M|5.0|thats what i thought this was when i heard it. really good album.
B00004T8RK|3.0|This is Pearl Jam's worst album, PERIOD. But, this album is still good. A lot of solid songs. Riot Act shows a step in the right direction after this album. I love Pearl Jam and their live shows rock. Old school Pearl Jam will always be better, but we live in different times and bands change. Get over it. Again, the album is great, but its their worst album.
B00000K3D4|5.0|Labyrinth is a magical film for children and adults alike.  I first saw it when I was about 12 years old and I instantly fell in love with it.  Now, at 24, I still enjoy it every bit as much as I did then.  Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie were both perfect in their roles.  I was both frightened and awed by the goblin king.  Also the music in this movie is amazing.  David Bowie does an awesome job singing five original songs.  My favorite scene is the ballroom masquerade scene, although the scene at the very end when Sarah confronts the goblin king in his castle is awesome too.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who has an active imagination and who wants to have a little magic in their life.
B00005JNEI|4.0|I have felt really alone in my opinions for a long, long time.  Especially after Bush was re-elected. I felt like the only one in the entire country that sees the truth about him.  This video gave me a lot of hope, that maybe people will see it and change their minds.  This video is extremely one-sided, I will admit.  If you hate Bush, you'll love it.  If you voted for Bush, you may feel stupid, but you will probably just be mad.  Michael Moore's opinions are very, very strong and if you do not agree with them, his documentaries tend to fall flat.  Also, I do not believe that all of his \\"facts\\" in the video are necessarily true.  Some of them are a little far-fetched, and even while I do not support the Bush administration, some of what was said in the video just doesn't seem reasonable.   But other than that, the footage of the war was real and I was saddened to see what's going on over there (for both sides.  The footage of the Iraqi children, the dead baby, and the other dead civilians was enough to make me look away from the tv for a few seconds).  And knowing that this war has no real purpose makes me sadder than anything else.  Anytime people die in a war with no cause leaves me with a churning anger in my stomach.  I was not alive during the Vietnam war, but I can still feel the anger that has lingered in the country over such an unnecessary bloodshed. <br /> <br />I don't really like Michael Moore, but this documentary was exactly what I needed.  I watched it after learning that one of my good friends is going to war sometime this year.  It was suggested to me I watch this.  I have been against the Iraq war for awhile now.  It wasn't always that way.  I was at one time a huge Bush supporter/war supporter and one of those crazy Republicans you dread getting into an argument with.  Of course I feel like a moron for that now, and I have since become a Democrat.  But at the time (just after 9/11), I felt terrified and unsafe in this country and, like everyone else in America, I turned to the guy who said he had all the answers, the guy who said he would protect us from another terrorist attack and secure our future by avenging the 9/11 deaths (something that I DO feel was necessary, by the way.  I am not against all war, but striking Iraq after Afghanistan was pointless and had *nothing* to do with it).  Now I feel cheated and lied to, and also very powerless.  I feel like those of us in America that are against the war no longer have a say.  We are pushed to the side and called anti-american.  Michael Moore finally gave us the voice that was taken from us when Bush was re-elected.  I do not know what the next four years will bring, but I know that if things continue as they are, America will never recover.  And that is sadder than anything.
B0006GAI6O|5.0|I'm not a fan of JLo but this was still a great movie.  The acting isn't the greatest but the music and choreography makes this a great movie.  There seems to be something missing part way through the movie.  They don't seem to develop JLo's storyline as much as you would expect them to.  Overall this doesn't affect the movie that much.  It is by far the best movie I've seen in a while.
B000002BYD|5.0|Let's face it, they'll wont be another TEN, but this album is great. I was a little disappointed at first, but I realized it's not 1991 and grunge is over. So I gave YIELD a chance and realized I Loved it. You can't compare it to old school Pearl Jam because these are just different times. Old school Pearl Jam will always be superior just like old school Metallica songs. That's just the way it is.
0262731541|5.0|... you should definitely read this book. I read the second and the third edition. Both have some very interesting information about bicycling. Sometimes the content is very technical and if you want to understand everything in detail it helps to have some kind of technical background. But even if you skip the \\"very\\" technical parts both, second and third edition, are great books.
B000002KHH|5.0|A great album by the heaviest band of it's time.  Their most famous songs are on here (Paranoid, War Pigs, and the ubiquitous Iron Man), as well as other great songs. <br /> <br />1. War Pigs/Luke's Wall- 5/5- a great intro track.  One of my all time favorites.  Gloomily cynical. <br />2. Paranoid- 5/5- kinda short, but a fantastic song none the less. <br />3. Planet Caravan- 3.5/5- I don't really like this one.  Sort of low key after the first two, and really wierd sounding. <br />4. Iron Man- 5/5- The song everyone knows, but few remember the artist of.  Vastly overplayed, but still awesome. <br />5. Elecric Funeral- 5/5- here we go.  This is what gloom and doom is all about.  Kinda wish this one made it onto We Sold Our Soul For Rock And Roll.  Oh well. <br />6. Hand Of Doom- 4/5- starts off slow, but gets faster.  Pretty cool. <br />7. Rat Salad- 3.5/5- mainly a drum solo used for filler.  Not bad. <br />8. Fairies Wear Boots- 5/5- great outro.  Another one of my faves. <br /> <br />Well, that about wraps it up.  Why are you still here?  Go buy the album!
B000002BKP|5.0|tru hiphop reaggae headz and blazer should cop this album it is one of the most under rated CD. the beats are sick the lyrics are slick youll get glued to this like a stick. production is outstanding i  miss dem so bad !peace!
B0000028UK|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS GREAT, ALTHOUGH I NEVER REALLY UNDERSTOOD WHY UNTIL RECENTLY. SOME OF THE SONGS LIKE DAUGHTER THAT USED TO ANNOY ME IN 1993 I LOVE NOW. THEY GREW ON ME I GUESS. ANYWAY THIS IS PEARL JAMS THIRD BEST. (TEN, VITALOGY, V.S., YIELD, NO CODE, RIOT ACT, BINAURAL) MY ORDER OF BEST ALBUMS
B0006SSOHM|3.0|It was pretty good.  I would consider it more of a gory thriller, rather than horror.  Nevertheless, an entertaining movie, definitely worth the watch.  But, as with most u.s./canada releases, this was not the 'real' movie you want to watch.  Unfortunately, the original had to be edited so it could go down from nc-17 to R rating...yes, it was originally that gory.  None of us in the u.s. got to see the original uncut version, and even worse, its not even available on dvd....stateside!!  Luckily, our mates in the uk DID get to see the uncut version in their theatres, and its also available on dvd (region 2, PAL).  This is the one that you guys wanna see, this was the one that was meant to be released originally:  http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007LEJNQ/qid=1111053552/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_11_1/026-4620663-2158002
B000002WCJ|5.0|This is regarded as one of Helloween's best albums (there's a power struggle going on between this and Time Of The Oath).  Cool artwork and great songs make this one a winner.  A great follow up to Keepers pt.I <br /> <br />1. Invitation- 5/5- similar to Initiation on the first Keepers album, this one is also an intro that sets us up for- <br />2. Eagle Fly Free- 5/5- great song pointing out the problems with the world and protesting against them.  God bless America (and everyone else too)! <br />3. You Always Walk Alone- 5/5- cool heavy song <br />4. Rise And Fall- 4/5- very similar to Eagle Fly Free, but not as good <br />5. Dr. Stein- 5/5- this one protests genetic engineering.  Really catchy.  The first verse is hilarious (read the CD insert.  You'll get it.). <br />6. We Got The Right- 4/5- slower, but inappropriately heavy. <br />7. Save Us- 5/5- fantastic song.  For some reason they don't put all of the lyrics in the insert.  Too bad. <br />8. March of Time- 5/5- happy song after Save Us.  Cool chorus. <br />9. I Want Out- 5/5- awesome song, one of their most popular.  Sort of follows the whole sort of youth-rebellion thing. <br />10. Keeper Of The Seven Keys- 5/5- second album in a row with a 13 minute song.  Religious lyrics and really cool music.  Michael Kiske shows of his pipes in the outro.  Wish I could do that...
0735619670|5.0|I have 2 books on the top of my shelf: Code Complete and Windows Server 2003 Inside Out. I consider both books to be the official bibles for programmers, developers, and old IT hack pros like me. <br /> <br />I bought the original edition of \\"Code Complete\\" back in 1994. 10 years later I bought the second edition as soon as I thumbed through it. This edition has been completely updated to reflect what's happening in programming. At nearly 1000 pages, there's many examples as well. I like the coding horror examples the best--these show examples of bad code. <br /> <br />Code Complete helps you think more clearly about coding. Then backs this up by providing many techniques and practices.
B000002BFZ|5.0|THIS ALBUM TOOK A LOT OF TIME TO LIKE. OVER THE YEARS I HAVE COME TO LOVE THIS ALBUM. IT IS SO DIFFERENT FROM OTHER PEARL JAM ALBUMS BUT ITS GREAT. IF YOU ARE EXPECTING TEN YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. DONT EXPECT ANYTHING AND JUST ENJOY THE MUSIC.
B00002Z88D|5.0|I have owned this album for years and I never get tired of it. <br /> <br />For anyone that has a true appreciation for all aspects of music, this is an excellent album. <br /> <br />There is an incredible amount of driving energy that rings through this album; it can be felt throughout. The better your sound system, the more you will be able to appreciate all of the different nuances that come through from both the band's instruments and especially the orchestra. <br /> <br />I'm literally floored at the orchestra's performance and the ability of the orchestra and Metallica as a metal band to perform symbiotically. To me, the album is a musical masterpiece for both the metal fan and the orchestra music fan. <br /> <br />I can even experience the orchestra players getting into the driving heart of much of their music as the tracks play. <br /> <br />I am especially fond of the version of \\"Fuel\\" on this album and prefer it to their original off of the Reloaded album, as well as many of the other songs. \\"Hero of the Day\\" was done beautifully and is a bit of a change-up from the original version they released. \\"No Leaf Clover\\" is available on this CD set as well. <br /> <br />The album has a lot of depth and energy in it. The songs included on this 2-CD set are many of their best works. The sound is clean for a live performance, and it's obvious that the recording for this album was taken with sound quality for production in mind. <br /> <br />I always enjoy listening to this album. Don't be shy to turn the volume up when you put the CD in for the first time and you'll be blown away by the sound that comes at you! It's a wonderful and welcome surprise that sends shivers! The album was beautifully done. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002W9P|5.0|The only reason that Helloween didn't score big in the U.S. is because their record company cut them off from selling albums here.  Regardless, this is a fantastic album.  Michael Kiske is my favorite of their singers, and the rest are all fantastic musicians.  The songs are all great too. <br /> <br />1. Initiation- 5/5- great, heavy song intro, setting us up for- <br />2. I'm Alive- 5/5- the real first track.  Cool song. <br />3. A Little Time- 5/5- cool chord progression.  The sound effects in the middle sort of remind me to the intro of Time by Pink Floyd (appropriately). <br />4. Twilight Of The Gods- 4/5- the weakest song on the album, but still really good.  What's that tell you? <br />5. A Tale That Wasn't Right- 5/5- a slower song.  The lyrics are sort of poor, but that doesn't really matter at this point. <br />6. Future World- 5/5- these guys fly on this one.  A nice, happy song which may be out of place for a band with the word \\"hell\\" in their name. <br />7. Halloween- 5/5- OMG!  13:18!  And it's good through the whole thing!  Amazing.  The end solo sort of reminds me of the game Tetris (they have a wierd sense of humor, whaddya want?). <br />8. Follow The Sign- 5/5- great guitar solo for the outro.  Sets us up for the sequel, Keeper of the Seven Keys pt.II.  Get that one too!
B000063JZQ|5.0|Just a few scant years after the Sharron Tate/ Charles Manson murders, Roman Polanski mounted this disturbing bloody tribute to \\"The Bard\\". (You remember -- Roman Polanski was married to Sharron Tate). <br />Purists everywhere hated this loose adaptation of Shakespeare's nastiest epic of power gone horribly mad. <br />Well, screw the puirists--  <br />This unholy testament of medieval malice and obsessive narcissism is un-matched in filmdom. <br />Scene after scene resonates with bad vibes leading to a visceral climax...Fans of Uber-Cinema...do not miss this film!!
B0000027RL|5.0|BRING ME BACK TO THE EARLY 90'S PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE  <br />MOST OF THESE NEW ROCK BANDS BLOW <br />KIDS TODAY DONT UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE EARLY 90'S SCENCE AND HOW AWESOME THESE BANDS WERE <br />THIS ALBUM IS NOT AS GOOD AS NEVERMIND OR INUTERO BUT THIS STILL IS A FANTASTIC ALBUM <br />PEARL JAMS BEST  <br />PERIOD PERIOD PERIOD
B00006JIA4|4.0|Above the song selections on these CD's, the sound quality is literally AMAZING and quite the compliment to Queen's work. Sound is highly important to me, especially with bands that use orchestrated music such as Queen does with a few of their songs.     The sound quality for this collection is above my expectations, and makes it that much more enjoyable to listen to on a mid-grade sound system, and if you have a digital surround sound system you will by no means be disappointed!    All three compact discs include 17 songs on each CD. The collection contains the essentials you would want out of a \\"Greatest Hits\\" collection from Queen.     Of the CD's I wanted to highlight the following:    Disc #1 consists of quite a few of the classics with group vocals such as \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\" and  \\"Flash\\", as well as the anthems \\"We Will Rock You\\", and \\"We Are The Champions\\".    Disc #2 is especially excellent for Freddie Mercury fans. Most of CD #2 features the anthems and ballads that highlight Freddie's vocal talent. This is my favorite of the three. \\"Radio Ga Ga\\", \\"I Want To Break Free\\", \\"A Kind of Magic\\" and \\"Who Wants To Live Forever\\" are excellent selections to have on the same CD to get your fix of Freddie with.  :)    Disc #3 is a mish-mosh of modern mixes or remixes of their previous recordings with various artists such as George Michael and Elton John. No complaints on this CD with the exception that a version of \\"Another One Bites The Dust\\" featuring Wyclef Jean was neither what I wanted or cared for on the CD as the remix and genre of that particular version doesn't fit.    Disc 3 isn't a total waste, however, I do think the song selections for this disc in particular could have been much better.    Overall I am very pleased with the CD and I highly recommend it based on the sound quality and song selection for the first two CD's alone. I paid $23.99 USD for this box set. The price for three CD's @ 17 songs each is very much worth it.
B000063DHL|5.0|Some people don't like this album, but I love it.  The songs are all good and really speak to me while at the same time maintaining the essential metalness. <br /> <br />1. Caught Somewhere In Time- 5/5- cool intro.  One of my favorites.  Really fast, great riffs. <br />2. Wasted Years- 5/5- nice message by Maiden.  Really good song. <br />3. Sea Of Madness- 5/5- heavier, like their older stuff.  The heaviest on the album. <br />4. Heaven Can Wait- 4.5/5- good song, but the chorus is kind of upbeat for the lyrics. <br />5. The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner- 5/5- my favorite song on the album, and one of my favorite songs by Iron Maiden overall. <br />6. Stranger In A Strange Land- 5/5- another of my favorites.  Great synth work and guitar solo. <br />7. Deja Vu- 5/5- ever hear one of those songs that creates the illusion of being longer than it really is?  This is one of those.  Nice. <br />8. Alexander The Great- 5/5- and now it's time for a history lesson by Iron Maiden.  Great musical work and excellent closer. <br /> <br />A strong effort by Iron Maiden, resulting in a great album.  Buy it.
1559408855|5.0|\\"Salo\\" is probably the most confrontational movie ever burned onto film stock. What are we (the viewer) suppose to take away from this utterly reprehensible film? <br />Pasolini once said about \\"Salo\\" his last film before he was assassinated--\\"I wanted to make a movie that made humanity sick.\\" --and so-- Pier Paolo Pasolini did just that. <br />Torture, humiliation and the putrid hubris of debauched Fascism all but overtake this study of humanity's disgust with itself. <br />That Pasolini based it all on the writings of the Marquis DeSade, is all- the-more brilliantly unhinged. <br />My Review: Kinda' dated, but remember--Pasolini was murdered a scant few weeks after this film was released...Watch with caution-- One of the best horror films ever made.
0375759069|5.0|Let me first state that this is the fifth book that I have read by Wilkie (Dead Secret, Haunted Hotel, Moonstone, and No Name). I went into this book with some bias since I have very much like the other stories that I have read by him.  I will say that this book did not disappoint.  This is a very good book that I would recommend.    With that being said, the book does begin a little on the slow side.  However, after the first 100 pages or so the story really begins to pick up and does not stop until the end.      This is a story, not so much about the Woman in White, as it as about Laura and Marian.  Marian, although being somewhat \\"ugly\\", turned out to be my favorite character, along with Count Fosco.  The Woman in While plays a small but key role in the book.  The mystery surrounding her makes the book very interesting since she seems to hold the key to the demise of Sir Percival Glyde.  Percival has a secret that can cause him great pain and social harm. This is the mystery of which the Woman in White knows and is trying to communicate to Laura so to save her from Percival and Count Fosco.  Also, it does come out in the end how Laura and the Woman in White look so much alike.  You must put aside your doubts about so many conincidences and remember this is just a story.  If you can do this, the book will be so much better.      Count Fosco: what can I say about him.  He is one of the best villians in literature.  Deep down you know he is bad guy.  Deep down Laura and Marian knows he is a bad guy but he is such a gentleman.  He can talk in a way that is degrading but he does it in such a way that the characters don't even realize they are being insulted.  He is also very cunning and smart.  However, he does have one weakness that comes through in the end.  It is not the looks of a woman that is his weakness but an admiration of this person on an intellectual level.  This woman, and I will not give it away, is his match when it comes to cunning and wit.  He realizes this and acknowledges it.  In the end, you love to hate Count Fosco since you know he is the brains behind the whole conspiracy but what a gentleman.      After the slow beginning, the book picks up and does not disappoint.  If you have read the Moonstone or No Name, which in my opinion are equal to or better than this book, the Woman in White will not let you down.  If you have read Woman in White and are thinking about Wilkie's other works, then I sugget the Moonstone and/or No Name.    In the end, read this book. You will not be disappointed that you did. It is a little long (645 pages in the modern library edition) but I read it in a week.  It is an easy, enjoyable read and worth the time.
B0007P3582|1.0|I wanted to give this album 4 stars but i will not give this overrated album any more than one.amazing was the best song but even that some can't compete with ja rule. I can't beleive that 50 dissed ja of making lov songs when he can't even make that type of songs better than ja does... NOBODY DOES IT LIKE ME-THEY DO BUT THEY AIN'T DO IT LIKE ME-NOBODY, nobody DOES IT LIKE R.U.L.E.......
B000002O96|5.0|I question some of these reviewers musical tastes. I previously had not gotten this CD because the CD packaging looks shoddy and I thought the CD itself must be shoddy- boy was I wrong. I think the performances are utterly wonderful on these tracks, Bo is Bo, Muddy is Muddy, Wolf is Wolf, not some polite watered down versions of themselves which almost always happens when superstars collaborate. <br />I can't say enough about this album. To me this is rocking blues the way its suppose to be played, a fun go for it attitude! The people who are giving this a bad review probably think that the only true blues is that to be played in the cotton fields by a bunch of poor black people not the Chicago electric elite! I lucked out and got this album used for close to nothing. Buy this album. You'll love it!
B000001GPX|5.0|It is common in classical music that a piece has several different interpretations. When you listen to the ones that are different from the one you are familiar with, you feel kind of disgusted, wether the performance is good or bad. <br /> <br />So, it is important that you go with the best available version in the first place so you don't develop a bad taste for yourself.  <br /> <br />Carlos Kleiber is the greatest. Period. Those who denounce Carlos Kleiber and recommend those \\"never heard of\\" recordings have already developed a bad taste.  <br /> <br />Get all the records and videos of Carlos Kleiber, and enjoy.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0786915749|5.0|Well when I read these books 16 or so years ago.I never thought they would serve as a guide for my life.I always loved Tas.He wasn't the smartest,but he never gave up on anything.And what he says to Fizban in Pax Tharkas it always makes me think of myself.Pg 426 Annointed verson \\"I asked my father once why kenders were little,why we weren't big like humans and elves.I really wanted to be big.\\" \\"What did your father say?\\" asked Fizban gently. \\"He said kenders were small because we were meant to do small things.'If you look at all the big things in the world closely' he said 'you'll see that they're really made up of small things all joined together' That big dragon down there comes to nothing but drops of blood,maybe.It's the small things that make the difference.\\" So as you read this wonderful work remember, These were not people who sought to become Heroes but people who did what they could to help.
B00068C7WA|5.0|Nice one-disc Billy Joel import, notable mainly for using the 4:33 single remix of \\"Piano Man\\" -- first time on CD.  It also uses the edit versions of \\"My Life,\\" \\"We Didn't Start the Fire,\\" \\"Tell Her About It,\\" \\"All About Soul,\\" and \\"Just the Way You Are.\\"<br /><br />Collectors may want those hard-to-find single edits, and the disc is a good choice for beginners, but the more comprehensive \\"Essential Billy Joel\\" can be got for around the same price.
B000055ZDT|5.0|This is the best doom album you can get. Heavy but not forced, vocals used as another instrument, brilliant playing, and good production. The songs are great too. 'I, The Witchfinder' is one of the best doom songs of all time, and one of the best metal songs ever. If you're a fan of slow heavy doom metal ala old Sabbath and St. Vitus, get this. It's amazing.
B00005K3O4|5.0|This movie was Awesone!!!!!!!!!!  It was so old school that it was cool.  Everybody should see this movie.
B0002ZYE1Y|1.0|I sometimes wonder whether people are abusing the reviewing system and just hyping up records to sucker people into buying them.  I agree with the last more honest review.  This album isn't that good. Very repetitive and aggravating.  I hope this is the last from Nightwish.
B0007NFL18|1.0|Basically all what 50 does is diss nas,jadakiss, fat joe, and especially ja rule. the beats are ok but the lyrics suck. I waited 4 ever for this album to come out when I first bought I was excited but now I dont even want to look at it!!!!!!!! <br /> DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!!
0913866156|4.0|This is by far one of the most beautiful decks I've ever owned, and one of the more powerful working tools out there.  I recommend it to people who want to add to a collection and to those who wish to do serious work and study with their tarot decks. <br /> <br />The deck does deviate in many places from the \\"standard\\" Rider-Waite format and interpretations, and it uses Kabbalistic symbols and interpretations, so it isn't the best choice for a beginning or intermediate reader.  I do highly recommend hunting down a copy of the helpful companion book for this deck because it gives a full card synopsis and exploration of the meaning of each card.
B000002J2F|5.0|Duke is the best Phil Collins-lead Genesis album. Duke's densely-textured sound is to be found nowhere else in rock music. This CD runs through a range of emotions-from the jubilant \\"Turn It On Again\\" to the sorrowful \\"Alone Tonight\\". \\"Please Don't Ask\\" is so personal, I can't believe it was even recorded. The album is so well thought out that the themes are quoted again in the last jam called \\"Duke's Travels\\"/\\"Duke's End\\". A monumental recording.
0875428940|5.0|I'm biased, this was my first deck, my favorite deck, and it's still the deck I do most of my divination with.  I highly recommend it to beginners and experts alike. <br /> <br />First, the artwork is just stunning, the cards convey emotion very well and you can usually understand the general tone of the card at a first glance.  The deck follows the \\"standard\\" Rider-Waite, with a few new interpretations, such as the beautiful and peaceful Death card and the cleverly reinvented Devil.  Using this deck in readings helps allay fears about the scarier cards showing up and helps the reader reassure clients of the true meanings. <br /> <br />For magical practitioners (everyone else can ignore), I can say from my own experience that the cards work very well in spellwork and seem to mesh harmoniously in all types of workings.  While other decks in my collection seem to be mundane at best, and resistant to accepting personal energies at worst, these seem to have been designed with the Wiccan practitioner in mind.  For those who lean towards more ceremonial and Kabbalistic bents of magic, these cards can be a great second working deck, but I recommend the Crowley Thoth as your primary. <br /> <br />I feel that the companion book is not really necessary for this deck as the cards are not very differently interpreted from the Rider-Waite, although if you are new, I recommend picking up the \\"Idiot's Guide to Tarot and Fortune Telling\\" by Arlene Tognetti and Lisa Lenard.
B000002J1S|5.0|The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway is the best Peter Gabriel-fronted Genesis album. A bizzare story is told through the 20-plus tracks on these CDs. With the opening track, you are pulled into a maze of intricate songwriting heard nowhere else in recorded music. It's a nightmarish (at times) trip to the Big Apple with no stops.    Just get it if you don't already have it. If you have an old copy, get the new remastered version. Most of the unwanted noise has been removed and the dynamic range has been expanded.    DW
B000001DZQ|5.0|This album is a comprehensive compilation from one of Blues Rock's most underappreciated guitar heroes.  There are shades of early Charlie Daniels on tracks 2 and three of disc 1.  Fans of Jimi Hendrix will appreciate Roy's psychadellic style on some tunes.  I have to question the review made by Amazon.com, because, although official reports say that Buchanan hanged himself in his jail cell by his shirt, those closest to him believe that story to be a lie.  Considering the fact that the police department that arrested Buchanan will not release the names of the arresting officers, I have my doubts about their story as well.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|It's close to 20 years now since the morning my symphonic band director in college walked into class and said, \\"You guys have got to hear this,\\" and those magnificent chords reverberated at full volume off the cement block walls. Phantom has been a fixture of my musical life ever since, and after I finally got to see it on Broadway 3 years ago, I would not have believed my experience of it could get any better.  <br /> <br />Then comes this movie, and after 8 viewings, I remain awestruck. You've no doubt seen a few reviews criticizing the cast, and Gerard Butler in particular for not having any artistry comparable to Michael Crawford's. For my part, I find these criticisms ridiculous. The film is an intrepid endeavor to transcend the stage production - a tall order, to say the least.  <br /> <br />To me, the movie did an incredible job of fleshing out the stage play, and criticisms of Butler are misplaced. My dad probably said it best: in the stage play, they seemed to go out of their way to make you wonder if the Phantom truly was nothing more than an apparition created by mass hysteria. In the movie, they went out of their way to make him real as a man. To that end, Butler's performance was OUTSTANDING. Often strained, always gruff - even raw - Butler's voice was nonetheless usually well intoned with occasional glimpses of its own artistry. His performance gave the tormented, suffering soul of the Phantom an emotional authenticity that the refined voice of Michael Crawford never really did for me.  <br /> <br />I'll admit that with my first viewing of the film, I was less than wowed by Patrick Wilson, despite his very good vocal performance. But after I thought about it a little, I found his \\"understated charm\\" to be the perfect counterbalance to the forceful, commanding, and darkly seductive Phantom. Wilson perfectly conveyed the groundedness that Christine so desparately needed. He also did a wonderful job of making the character's main flaw the over-confidenceof youth; and the great surprise such a young man might feel at having himself tested. He was the perfect breath of fresh air after being lost in the \\"dungeon of black despair\\" with the Phantom.  <br /> <br />As for Emmy Rossum: again, the casting choice here gave the character an emotional authenticity I always found just a little lacking in the stage production. The role commands a vocal maturity that is typically cast by women well beyond the character's emotional age. (Sarah Brightman and The Leading Ladies, for example, were in their late 20's to early 30's in their debut performances.) This lovely, YOUNG, and extremely talented girl made Christine utterly engaging as you watch her coming of age and developing an identity apart from her father's memory.  <br /> <br />In short, the stage production, for me, has come to be an exercise of the imagination - a ghost story. The movie is a study in primal human emotions, and easily succeeds in stirring every one of them: loneliness, rage, grief, lust, fear, frustration, joy, and love - they're all there, and the film draws you in to experience them right along with the characters.  <br /> <br />It's hard to sum this up, but a pivotal scene made this movie the creme de la creme of film for me, totally separate from the usual Hollywood fare. Late in the film, the black knight drives a team of black horses to the cemetery, drawing the heroine into his trap; and the white knight gallops, riding bareback, through a misty dawn to save her. Most films offend me when they use melodramatic imagery like this to try and stir me. \\"Phantom,\\" by contrast, succeeded absolutely. It succeeded because the cast and the filmmakers didn't try to impose these personas on the characters at the start. By the time the film reaches the ride to the cemetery, you already know that there is nothing supernatural about the Phantom - he's a dark, powerful, seductive presence preying upon the grief and imagination of a teenage girl. And there's nothing supernatural about the hero, either. He's simply ungiven to any eccentricities of emotion or imagination - but he's also unsparing in his adoration. As such, Raoul becomes an anchor, a rescuer and the perfect romantic figure to the emotionally wrought 17 year old. By the time you see the Phantom cloaked in a black cape driving black horses, and Raoul in the flowing white shirt astride the white horse, there's no need for future contrivances for either character to live up to the imagery: they've already been elevated to those romantic positions in our imaginations.  <br /> <br />Minnie Driver, Ciaran Hinds, Simon Callow, and James Fleet are not incidental in their comic relief roles: they're all fantastic in their own right, as are Victor Maguire, Jennifer Ellison and Murray Melvin in minor supporting roles. Miranda Richardson is a deep and intriguing Mme. Giry. (Is it a sisterly concern she has for the Phantom, or is she a little in love with him herself?) I can't say I cared much for Kevin McNally as Buquet, but it occurs to me that was the point of that character.  <br /> <br />It's hard to imagine any greater perfection being brought to this timeless story than what's been achieved by this film. The storyline, the music, the cinematography, the effects - nothing is missing. <br />
B0006GAOCW|5.0|Katie Holmes did it!  She was perfect for the role of first daughter.  She had the elegant and the fun character all in her.  I really love this movie and it is very beautiful. <br /> <br />Does anyone know where I can find the soundtrack for this movie?  It had many great songs, but I can't find the soundtrack even on amazon.com~
B00013RC8O|5.0|I should hate this movie. I always wanted a '70 Challenger R/T and in some part thanks to this classic, offbeat movie, prices have now skyrocketed far beyond what I could pay for one. This is a REAL Cult movie. Mopar fanatics have long exchanged philosophical points of view about it and if it had used a bigger name actor, it could have immediately done to the Dodge Challenger what Dirty Harry did for the Smith & Wesson 44 Magnum. Obviously, the Dodge Boys missed a real marketing opportunity back then. Instead, for almost three decades it languished almost unseen, occassional showing up on Cinemax or some video catalog for sixty bucks or more. Now, to my regret, it is available to the unwashed masses (just kidding, sort of) and even spawned a remake.    Now, about that remake. Fox TV did this back in '96 and the Vanishing Point purist that I am, I cringed with anticipation of this. I admit I liked it, not as a remake, but as a '90's version of Kowaslki's journey. Now it seems to have shuffled off to its own video Purgatory. The story made use of the paranoia of the times much like the '70's version did of the anomie of the Vietnam era. So it was not the equal of the original, but did not try to simply retell the story because each decade had its own social dynamics to contend with. if you haven't seen it, it starred Viggo Mortenson before many people had heard of him. Steve Railsback is his usual overcaffeined loose gun going after Kowalski in his black '70 Charger named The Beast. At least we got two stunning Mopars driving like heck through John Ford country. Now back to the original:    Nowadays driving 150 mph into a bulldozer is something you would only do on Fear Factor. Back in the early '70's, it was not that common either, but any teen facing a possible hitch in Vietnam might find it a preferable fate. Such was youth in the days of draft, war, race riots, and cheap gas. Kowalski is an outcast in a lost generation and is like the last wild mustang of the west-I guess it would have been too obvious if he were driving a Boss 429 or even a white (Dodge) Charger. Cleavon Little is Super Soul, actually the Superego trying to bring Kowalski back from his doomed Id-yssey. I was always amused for years over the fact that his flight begins on the incomplete I-70 west of Denver, and that in the '90's it was STILL under construction. Kowalski may be a drugged out anti-hero, but he is still portrayed as a man with more integrity than society who will still take the time to see if that cop he just ran off the road has survived his rollover. They don't make 'em like that anymore. As part of a triumvirate of social misfit car chase movies of the early '70's (Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry and Two-lane Blacktop being the others) this is the best. If you grew up in those times you will dig it, if you were too young, you might just wonder what the heck is up with this dude and dismiss it. That would be your loss.
B0000025WQ|5.0|I believe the first time i heard this album I may have been 3 or 4, i dont remember. What i do remember is that i loved it. I remember dancing to \\"All Through the Night\\" & \\"She Bop\\". Hearing this cd again, now that im in my 20's really takes me back to the days of the 80s, when i was little, and music was good.
B00005ATQF|5.0|It is increasingly difficult for younger people to understand the 60s and what happened in America. The catalyst for change was the Viet Nam War. On the one hand, we had a society that was chafing under the paradigms of the 1950s, and the residual effects of the black and white world which we tried to create in the aftermath of World War II and the ascendancy of communism. On the other hand, we had a generation looking to change the way we perceive the world, including how we look at enemies, and whether some people were really our enemies. In some ways the Viet Nam War became a surreal alternate reality where our soldiers received a huge cultural shock leaving the relatively cloistered Disneyland of America. The difficulty becomes capturing not the reality of Viet Nam, but the feeling of Viet Nam. Stanley Kubrick did exactly that with \\"Full Metal Jacket.\\"<br /><br />There are two portions to this movie, with the second part of the movie having sub-parts. In the first portion of the movie we meet the principal character we will follow into Viet Nam, Private J.T. \\"Joker\\" Davis. Joker is the observer of the indoctrination of new Marine recruits, where pampered civilian sons are turned into fighting men. R. Lee Ermey established a milestone in military character portrayals by his role as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. He is mean and tough, but he is that way because he knows that the reality of war requires mean and tough men. Unfortunately, Private Leonard \\"Gomer Pyle\\" Lawrence (chillingly played by Vincent D'Onofrio) is unable to tolerate the stress of indoctrination, and snaps in a very violent, shocking, way. Thus ends basic training and Private Joker's transition to Viet Nam.<br /><br />The transition from basic training to Viet Nam is instantaneous, with no discussion of the aftermath of Private Gomer Pyle's actions. However, as I pointed out earlier, consider the shock that these young men faced as they went from the black and white, sheltered life of a citizen of the United States to a corrupt country where death was around every corner. The culture shock is difficult to convey, and yet the disorientation in the transition from the first part of the movie to the second part makes a good attempt at having the audience experience the feeling, even if it is in a relatively benign way.<br /><br />The second part of the movie explores what happens when people who have been exposed only to American culture are faced with the reality of combat. Private Joker must confront combat and the result of combat head on while being a pacifist at his core. However, even his peaceful nature can not stand by while a vengeful and ferocious enemy is killing his comrades. Private Joker is faced with mass graves and the reality of a war of attrition and the senseless violence of some Americans, though the enemy was just as ruthless when the opportunity arose.<br /><br />The movie uses the 1968 Tet Offensive as a backdrop for a series of intense combat scenes leading up to a confrontation between Private Joker's squad and an unseen enemy. The violence in this series of scenes is graphic and simultaneously poignant. Death in combat is never pretty, and Stanley Kubrick did his best to depict combat death in all its horrific detail. If anyone is tempted to glorify combat this movie should be mandatory watching.<br /><br />The final scene in this movie is a confrontation between Private Joker and an enemy sniper. The confrontation is incredible because of the complexity of the numerous feelings. There is fear. There is the sudden realization that the enemy is only a little different from us; young and frightened. There is the desire to not have to kill the enemy, to wish that circumstances could be otherwise. There are more feelings, many more, for an empathetic viewer.<br /><br />Knowledgeable viewers will not mistake \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" for a documentary, or even being more than passingly factual. What this movie does do is give viewers the feeling ofthe era, the feeling of being a soldier in a war that many, and perhaps ultimately most, in America did not want to fight. This war helped America realize that World War II was not happening again, that black and white was gray, and that we too were different, though we were realizing it all too slowly. Of all the Viet Nam War related movies that I have watched, and I have seen all but one of significance, this movie seems to me to best portray how we felt as the 60s came to an end, whether we like to remember that feeling or not.rs the feeling of the era, the feeling of being a soldier in a war that many, and perhaps ultimately most, in America did not want to fight.

B00028HBKC|3.0|I got this when it first came out,watched it 3 times in a row and put it away.I thought the best movie i`d seen along time. Until yesterday 3/15/05 when i watched again not as good as i remember.so maybe all believers non believers take a step back get ahold of yourself.now that the hypes over maybe you`ll have a different view. anyways about the movie it was kinda slow.maybe overdramatic depending on how u look at it.Was it romans doing their job?Or was it the end of humanity?don`t know?I am pretty sure that no man without the help of drugs could take that type of beating.like iron tipped leather straps that can dig into wood,the human body isnt meant to take a beating like that unless of course he was being helped by a higher power hmmmmmm.I still think its alot to do with a mother watching her child being tortured and not being able to comfort him which is sad.it`s not a movie i`ll watch over and over again like the classics ya knw COOL HAND LUKE or PAPILLION maybe the PASSION recut will be better.

B0001XAPZ6|5.0|First off, credit must be given to Walt Disney Studios for allowing us to finally get a chance to see this amazing work of animated art.  Also, I give a nod to Pixar here because many executives at Pixar encouraged Disney to pick up the rights to Miyazaki's films.  Thanks go to both of these great family oriented entertainment giants.<br /><br />\\"Nausicaa\\" is the first real effort of the animator called Hayao Miyazaki.  It is an amazing and detailed work of animated art that can be enjoyed by the whole family.  This film established all of the familiar themes of Miyazaki, which are :<br /><br />1. Anti-War : Miyazaki dislikes violence and shows war as a destroyer of not only people, but also a destroyer of society and the planet itself.<br /><br />2. Everyday Life : There is a constant theme of simply enjoying everyday life, the normal work, toil and rest of an ordinary day.<br /><br />3.  Showing the feminine as an integral part of creation : the Miyazaki film always shows feminine figures as something other than shallow fashionistas and/or weak victims.  Usually, the main protagonist is a heroine who saves her society (and/or her friends) in some way.  However, there is usually a \\"evil\\" woman somewhere in the film who is a foil to the heroine (in Nausicaa it is the brutal woman who seeks to destroy nature to ensure Human survival).<br /><br />Please give this film a rental and see what you think.  If you enjoy this, please consider Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke.  Thanks for taking the time to read this!
0446677450|1.0|This book is pretty much worthless. He does make a good point on how middle class tends to by more liabilities than assets and if you want to succeed you need assets to work for you, but that is the only good point. He constantly repeats this throughout the book and tells all these wondeful stories that sound great. At the end is the kicker. He markets his cashflow game. If you want to read books worth the while then read books on investing in stocks from people like Peter Lynch or real estate investing books. They at least give you concrete ways instead of stories on how to possibly succeed. Luckily i borrowed this book from the library instead of buying it.
B000002H70|5.0|Disintegration can easily be argued to be the best album of the Cure. tHe Cure started as more of a punk band, and flowed into a dark side with albums like Faith and Pornography. Struggling, they kept it together with many line up changes, and after the Kiss me album of 1987, singer Robert Smith decided it was time for an important album. Disintegration is important to many people all over the world. In my opinion, its the begining of the pretty Cure songs, however they returned to a more gloomy style like that of the Pornography album. <br /> <br />Plainsong - The opening track is one that sets the tone for the rest of the album. The begining has wind chimes and continues with many layers of synth. <br /> <br />Pictures of You - A masterpiece within a masterpiece, Pictures of You has made me cry many times before. It can mean alot to one who has lost someone in any way. <br /> <br />Closedown - A short sweet song. Has a nice drum pattern. <br /> <br />Lovesong - A wedding present to Robert's wife. It's simply a solid song with simple lyrics. <br /> <br />Last Dance - As you approach this track, the gloom starts to take effect. Last Dance continues with a lot of synth. <br /> <br />Lullaby - This song is about a spiderman  who is 'having me for dinner tonight'. It has a very likably beat to it, but the lyrics are creepy. Either way, the music fits the lyrics perfectly. <br /> <br />Fascination Street - Lots and lots of layers of synth. It's a very pretty song. I perfer the extended version myself. <br /> <br />Prayers for Rain - Good bass. <br /> <br />Same Deep Water as You - This song can lull you to sleep if you're not paying attention, but if you do, its very dramatic. <br /> <br />Disintegration - Falling apart...a masterpiece. <br /> <br />Homesick - Adds piano. The gloom doesn't let up at all. <br /> <br />Untitled - About regret. I liked it the first time I heard it. <br /> <br />Some songs from the Cure are hard to like. It's almost hard to like some songson your first listen, but once you do, they can change your life.

B00004XMS0|2.0|FIRST OF ALL THE BOXED SET IS REALLY NOT WORTH IT, AND FRANKLY ONLY THE FIRST TWO MOVIES ARE THE BEST, THE FIRST BATMAN IS REALLY A FIVE STAR MOVIE, BATMAN RETURNS IS ANOTHER FIVE STAR MOVIE, BATMAN FOREVER A 2 STAR MOVIE I MEAN COME ON VAL KILMER AS BATMAN(HA HA HA) HE WAS THE WORST BATMAN AND THE MOVIE WAS TOO CAMPY AND NOT DARK AS THE FIRST TWO MOVIES, THEN BATMAN AND ROBIN 1 STAR MOVIE  I MEAN FOR GOD'S SAKE GEORGE CLOONEY AS BATMAN (OMG!) HE AND VAL KILMER WERE THE TWO WORST BATMANS, MICHAEL KEATON WAS THE BEST BATMAN, JACK NICHOLSON WAS THE BEST JOKER, DANNY DeVITO WAS THE BEST PENGUIN, AND MICHELLE PFEIFFER WAS DEFINATELY THE BEST AND GOOD LOOKING CATWOMAN EVER, SO IN CONCLUSION STICK WITH THE FIRST TWO BATMAN MOVIES AND SKIP BATMAN FOREVER AND BATMAN AND ROBIN.
B00028HBKM|5.0|\\"The Passion Of The Christ\\" is a towering example of what motion pictures can be. It takes the 2000-year-old gospel narratives and brings them to life in a way that is shocking in its realism and power. <br /> <br />Mel Gibson has been true to his intention: to make a movie that will stand the test of time, one that can reinvigorate the faith of some and perhaps cause others to find theirs. <br /> <br />The acting, cinemetography, and score are all Oscar-caliber. The special effects bring the Passion of Jesus to life, so real they enduce cringes and outpourings of sympathy. Jim Caviezel should have been nominated for the Academy Award for his protrayal of the Son of God. <br /> <br />This is a movie that everyone should see, and any practicing Christian will want to own. Five stars!

0446677450|5.0|Before reading Rich Dad Poor Dad, I figured every buck one made should be quickly spent.  But, author Robert Kiyosaki, says that kind of thinking is dangerous.  Instead, he recommends how to manage money.  This book is very clever on how, if you have money, to manage it, and if you don't have money, how to work your way up.  One of the most inspirational lines in the book is \\"Most people in the world work for someone, if you really want to manage your money better, get your own franchise.\\"  This sentence makes you really think. <br /> This book has a lot of moral values attached to it.  This teenager has 2 fathers, a rich eigth grade dropout and the poor college graduate.  This book has many aspects of the rich dad talking about how to take money and invest it, while the poor dad try's to forget about his money problems.  This book basically lays out the philosophy about all you need to know about money.  This book has been a best seller only for one reason,  It talks about to well make money.  This author had written this book about life experiences.  This is why it was a best seller, his tips in the book really work.  This book is an inspiration fro all ages, I am 13 and I learned a lot from this book.  I'm just saying if you want some really good tips on how to handle your money, then pick up this book, and read it. <br />

I would love to have heard her original template.  <br />Dwayne <br />Canada
B000268QB2|5.0|This fact alone speaks volumes. People DO know talent when they hear it. This reviewer had never heard of Keane before October of 2004. While on a business trip to the UK, I heard \\"Everybody's Changing\\" on one of the BBC radio channels. A catchy tune with a nice melody. To make a short story boring, I found out who the artist was and, while in Liverpool, bought the UK version of HOPES AND FEARS. It contains two more (equally great) songs than the US version: \\"On A day Like Today\\" and \\"Untitled 1\\".  <br /> <br />Yes, Tom Chaplin sounds somewhat like Freddy Mercury, but that's where the similarities stop. Keane has achieved an auditory illusion by making one's ear not miss hearing guitars. You might not even realize there are no six-string instruments if you didn't read the CD liner notes (or the reviews). What is obvious on HOPES AND FEARS , is twelve of the most ear-pleasing songs by three very gifted musicians.
B0007O38F8|1.0|Yeah, first of all, nice cover.  In the original shot Fitty was looking a trifle weak, so they had to draw on all the muscles...lol.  Same thing applies to the tracks.  God, this album SUCKS.  Don't get me wrong, I hated his first also, I think 50 Cent may actually be legally retarded, and his getting shot multiple times doesn't make his crap any more compelling to me personally. If you have absolutely no idea what real music is, or if you're just the typical toy who buys/downloads anything with cheap generic rinky-dink beats and wanna-be \\"gangsta\\" lyrics so that you can feel like you, too, are some kind of badass, go for it, I'm sure this BS will sell in the millions anyway.  No accounting for tastes..
B00063EMJ6|5.0|this cd flows very well, and includes anything the new fan could want in a Neil young collection.  Neil young and his compatriots crosby, stills, and nash are finally getting the recognition they deserve.  one of my favorite songs from the group, \\"ohio,\\" is included on here, so this isn't only about neil young, just mostly about him.  I would recommend getting the new greatest hits for crosby, stills, and nash, along with this album, and getting Deja Vu (his best known collaboration with the group, renamed CSNY) and getting Retrospective: the best of Buffalo Springfield, which is the band many of these guys were in early on.  Then you will have a complete collection of the best work of these groups.

B00000DF6O|5.0|fans of B.B. king will of course like this album, just like all of his others.  but what about the new fan, someone looking to branch out into other musical styles beyond those demonstrated by bad rappers? <br />well, I would think that this is one of the better introductions.  BB's best album is Live at the Regal, but Blues on the Bayou is also a wonderful piece of work.  It was produced by him, in four days, without overdubs. just a bunch of good blues tunes.  The production is quite well done, with major blues purists seeming to have the only complaints (they want a grittier style, I suppose).  He revisits older songs as well as creates new ones on this cd.  It is relaxed, laid back, and has plenty of room for other musicians to show their stuff, particularly the guy playing the hammond organ (it's all over the place on this cd, and creates a very nice effect).  If you have never heard B.B. king you should get this cd, as well as Live at the Regal.  Then get all the other stuff he has, including collaborations with Bobby Bland and Eric Clapton.  lets hope that B.B will be around for a long time yet, so that we may continue hearing his wonderful music!
B0007P3582|4.0|I see reviews on her saying \\"all he talks about is drugs and guns\\" it's 50 Cent, this isn't \\"The sounds of music.\\" All in all the album is alright, not great but alright. Lacking from Get Rich but still solid compared to what's out there today, MTV IS GARBAGE, SO IS BET. Yes 50 does make certain threats on purpose it helps him sell his albums.
B00004Y6O9|3.0|the music on here strikes me as fairly asinine and mindless, much like most of metal music.  The singer wasn't very good at all, the guitarist couldn't keep in tune, and the songs were quite uninspired.  This band had to keep doing cover songs just to fill up the discs!  Only 3 songs on here are worth listening to, which is why I gave it 3 stars.  \\"running with the devil\\" is decent and a good opener, \\"eruption\\" is a terrific example of fingertapping work from eddie (though I am not that impressed, to tell you the truth) and \\"jamie's crying\\" is well done.  The rest is mindless pap.  Even the good songs weren't enough to convince myself to keep this mess of a metal album.  This just proves that top notch musical skills don't always equal good music.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|(Note:  This review covers just the set itself, not a review of each movie).    Wow, this thing is frigging huge!  Don't be fooled by the innocent looking picture of the box.  This set unfolds...and unfolds...and unfolds until it's almost six feet long.  It has all the alien movies (except for \\"Alien vs Predator\\") with two versions of each movie, the bonus disks for each movie, and a bonous disk that contains lots of leftover, but still fascinating extras, including all the material from the origional \\"Alien\\" Laserdisk.  If you're looking for a comprehensive set of the Alien movies, this is probably your best bet.    A special note must go to the box itself.  Each section of the foldouts shows noteworthy moments from each Alien movie, such as various alien poses, charachter shots, and action bits.  The main colors here are black and dark metalic green, which suits the atmosphere of the movies really well.    I must say that this is a great bargin.  Get all four Alien movies (two versions each), along with bonus material for each movie, and a bonus disk with hours of stuff to pour through.  However, be sure you're a really big fan of the series, because this set is not cheap.  It's really expensive, but in my opinion it's well worth it (but I am a die-hard fan, so i'd be happy to buy it anyway).
B0007TKNL0|5.0|While I have not yet seen the DVD presentation, I have, in fact, seen the film in the theater 7 times (and I have pre-ordered the DVD).  Let me assure you, I do not see a film in the theater 7 times if it is not worthy.  Gerard Butler gives a stunning performance as the Phantom.  He is sensual, brooding, seductive, and yet manages to maintain a sympathetic aire.  You genuinely care about him and want him to get the girl in the end.  In fact, Gerard Butler's eyes are so intense that often he can portray an emotion without words.  It is a very difficult feat and a high test to his acting ability that he is able to pull this off!  After seeing him portray the Phantom I cannot imagine anyone else in the role.  He has a screen presence that will make you truly weak in the knees!  As for Patrick Wilson as Raoul, there is not a lot to say.  Although his character portrayal is very accurate to Gaston Leroux's novel (weak willed, kind of a \\"cry baby\\") he does have an excellent voice.  Emmy Rossum as Christine is truly a triumph!  She has an absolutely wonderful voice.  Being so young, she played the \\"innocent\\" very convincingly, and her wardrobe was stunning.  I would highly recommend this movie to any Phantom fans, as well as anyone who loves a good romantic movie.  Two thumbs way up for this one!
B0007OCG4W|4.0|Mike Nichols is enjoying something of a comeback. First, there was the critically-lauded Angels in America mini-series that aired on HBO and now the equally successful Closer. Together, they prove that there is an audience for smart dramas by and for adults. Nichols has a keen sense for absorbing character studies that explore, in unflinching honesty, the complex relationships between men and women. Closer shows the destructive results of infidelity.<br /><br />The characters in Closer are messed up and damaged people. They make choices that hurt others and don't think of the consequences. The dialogue is intelligent and insightful about the way people can so easily hurt each other emotionally and make the wrong choices. Mike Nichols brings a strong visual eye to the film as he successfully gives the play that it is based on a cinematic look while retaining the dialogue that has its own unique rhythm and cadence. This is due in large part to having the play's author, Patrick Marber, adapt his own work for the big screen. The result is a tough, honest look at the intertwining lives of four people.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the only extra is a music video for Damien Rice's moving song, \\"The Blower's Daughter.\\"

B000002GQK|4.0|This is one of the Moodies most serious albums, but it is great never the less.  The final organ fugue and guitar blast of the song Procession is worth the cost of the CD alone. Mike Pinder was clearly becoming distraught with the human condition around this time, and it shows in his song My Song. But as was the Moody Blues way, even this song ends with a glimmer of hope. Our Guessing Game and You Can Never Go Home are fantastic, and Emily's Song is a very sweet song written for john lodge's daughter. While this album isn't as gleeful as To Our Children's...  or In Search Of... , it's still fantastic.

The albums loudest track \\"Lovely To See You\\" goes straight into one of it's softest, \\"dear Diary\\". Ray also wrote the amazing \\"Lazy Day\\", and Justin sings the beautiful \\"Never Comes The Day\\" and the joyous \\"Send Me No Wine\\".  Mike Pinder ends the album with a wonderfully optimistic three part suite. \\"Life's ours for the making/ Eternities waiting\\"...what a wonderfully positive note to end on! \\"To Share Our Love\\" and \\"So Deep Within You\\" are my two least favorites on the album, but neither one is a bad song by any stretch.
B0007O38F8|1.0|Remove the sleeve of the deluxe edition of 50 Cent's THE MASSACRE, and you'll see a photo of the artist aiming a gun at the camera, surrounded by a display of firearms of all kinds. Look further and you'll find an insert advertising Reeboks, complete with discount coupon. The booklet in the edited version includes a photo of the artist pouring water into a lovely, scantily-clad woman's cleavage instead of the gun picture...And then you get to hear the album, which begins with a girl's voice sighing over a valentine, followed by blasts of gunfire.<br /><br />Strong language and constant references to guns, violence, drugs, and explicit sex with objectified women combined with monotonous backing tracks and monotone delivery make THE MASSACRE a hard album for any parent to love. With an intensity so overdone that it would seem like self-parody if his lyrics weren't so deadly serious, 50 Cent weakens the power of his talent by indulging in this fierce and fatal machismo. The edited version had to be SO edited that is sounds like nonsense.<br /><br />It's too bad, because 50 Cent is a good songwriter, The instrumental tracks are beautifully produced and sometimes even mesmerizing; the lyrics are the work of an obviously intelligent, hard-working man. But they are also unrelentingly nasty, especially if you happen to be female, and these songs send a loud-and-clear message that problems are best solved with violence. There isn't a young person in the world who really needs to hear this CD, and that's a shame.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|I never cared much for Brad Pitts acting, but in <br />Troy, he was sensational! The fighting scenes were <br />very well done. The music in Troy, reminded me of <br />Gladiator, which was also great! It's a long movie, <br />but it's really good.
B00007KQA3|5.0|This movie was exceptionally well done and did a great job of giving the characters and audience a false sense of security that was afforded the thought criminals.  The brainwashing of members of society to betray the misguided trust of thought criminals and report them to \\"the party\\" was well done in this adaptation. <br /> <br />I particularly admired (but not liked) the scene where the children are singing praises of Big Brother and the party while the adults (parents) seem to look at them with a great deal of apprehension really sets the scene.  It tells the audience two things:  The first is that if the children are brainwashed into believing whatever the party tells them then they will report anyone who deviates from the party's doctrines.  The second thing it tells us is that while the \\"resistance's\\" power resides in the proles the party's power resides in the youth who will inherit the future...  A very bleak picture overall and a perfect adaptation of Orwell's classic book.

1400031354|5.0|The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series by Alexander McCall Smith is one of the most delightful and charming mystery series ever written.  In Tears of the Giraffe, McCall Smith begins where he left off with book number one, The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.<br /><br />Precious Ramotswe is engaged to Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni , and it is amusing to see them wade through the minefield of a couple preparing for marriage.  The must choose a ring, decide how to combine households, and deal with a jealous and recalcitrant maid.  Two foster children appear on the scene to make things even more interesting.<br /><br />Mma Ramotswe is the only female detective in Botswana, and she opened her agency to make a living and provide assistance to her fellow Africans.  Precious is not necessarily well educated, but she has an abundance of common sense, logic and intuition.  She can sense where a long dead person is buried nearby, and can tell when a person is lying just by looking at them.  It is fun to watch the self-deprecating Precious match wits with a Duke-educated college professor-and win.  When Precious is stumped, she relies on her \\"bible,\\" The Principles of Private Detection by Clovis Andersen.  The cases she takes on are not much different from those of an American detective, including infidelity, missing persons, etc.  But sometimes, solving the moral dilemmas presented by these cases is more difficult than solving the cases themselves.<br /><br />Tears of the Giraffe is also a book about love.  There is not just the love between Precious and Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, but also their love for their fellow Africans and Botswana.  While written in modern times, it is fascinating to read about life in Botswana, and how Botswana differs from her African neighbors.<br /><br />The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is not your typical mystery series, and Tears of the Giraffe is simply enchanting.  I have already started book number 3, Morality for Beautiful Girls.
0684833395|5.0|Catch-22, by Joseph Heller, is the story of Yossarian, a bombardier fighting for the United States in World War II.  Heller takes a lighthearted and satirical approach to address the serious topic of war.  While doing this, he addresses several themes including the idea that money and power corrupt, and conveys the loss of religious faith and the overall uselessness and destructiveness of war. <br />  <br />Catch-22 takes place on Pianosa, a small island in the Mediterranean Sea.  The reader witnesses Yossarian and his desperate attempts to get out of the war.  He was once a great bombardier, but loses interest after he witnesses the death of a man on his plane.  He no longer cares about the assigned missions and instead \\"had decided to live forever or die in the attempt, and his only mission each time he went up was to come down alive\\" (29).  Yossarian finds himself trapped in the war due to his antagonist, Colonel Cathcart, a man so interested in being promoted that he will put other people's lives in danger.  The problem is that Cathcart continually raises the number of missions required of the men in order to complete their service in the army.  \\"They were in a race and knew it, because they knew from bitter experience that Colonel Cathcart might raise the number of missions again at any time\\" (27).  Yossarian finds himself closing in on the number of missions he needs to get out of the war, but sees the number rise just before he can get there.  He can also be excused from service if he is insane, but Catch-22 makes this option impossible.  One part of Catch-22 says that a man is insane if he flies his bombing missions, but if the man says that he is insane and asks to be excused from duty, the fact that he is requesting this proves that he is in fact perfectly sane because \\"a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind\\" (46). <br />  <br />Catch-22 features many separate characters, all ofwhich have their own side stories.  The book often switches from present to past to allow the reader to learn much about many of the characters.  Most of the focus, however, is given to Yossarian, a character who is hard not to like and feel sorry for.  The novel shows how Yossarian and the other characters spend their time in the army-both during missions and during their free time.  The reader gets to witness how the characters deal with the war and watch as some of them, characters like Colonel Cathcart and the cook, Milo Minderbinder, use the war to their advantage.  Catch-22 is a constant struggle by Yossarian to save his life and to stop flying bombing missions. <br />  <br />Catch-22 features several important themes.  The first shows how power and money corrupt.  Most people would hate being at war, but Colonel Catchart and Milo Minderbinder definitely do not mind.  Cathcart is a man who cares about little else than being promoted.  His powerful position and hunger for more power drives him to raise the number of missions his men must fly in order to complete their military service in order to impress his superiors and possibly get his promotion.  Milo, on the other hand, is totally driven by money.  He runs a syndicate where he is constantly buying and selling goods throughout Europe.  However, he begins to lose money and is willing to do just about anything to make money back.  \\"One night, after a sumptuous evening meal, all Milo's fighters and bombers took off, joined in formation directly overhead and began dropping bombs on the group.  He had landed another contract with the Germans, this time to bomb his own outfit\\" (257).  Both Milo and Cathcart are willing to endanger the other soldiers just to feed their appetites for money and power.  Their corruption is only one of the several themes present in Catch-22. <br />  <br />Other ideas that are introduced in the novel are the loss of faith and the uselessness of war.  After being involved in the war for so long, Yossarian has abandoned any belief in a higher being.  He says, \\"And don't tell me God works in mysterious ways.  There's nothing so mysterious about it.  He's not working at all.  He's playing.  Or else He's forgotten all about us...What in the world was running through that warped, evil, scatological mind of His...Why in the world did He ever create pain?\\" (179).  The war, along with the viciousness and selfishness of the people that Yossarian deals with have led him to lose any religious faith he might have had.  He does not agree with the war that he is fighting in and seeing his friends die in.  War, in the novel, is overall depicted as useless since there is no real reason why the men are fighting, except for the benefit of people higher up in command. <br />  <br />Overall, Catch-22 is an excellent book.  The only complaints that could be made about it is the fact that it is sometimes difficult to follow since the plot jumps from the present to past without warning.  Also, there are numerous characters with many names and military positions to get confused.  However, after a while, one will get used to this and it will not be hard to finish the novel.  Joseph Heller decides to depict war in a comical and satirical manner, styles that are not often used for books in the war genre.  It is a very funny book, but is also deeply significant since it addresses the ideas of power, money, corruption, religion, and the uselessness and viciousness of war.  It is a great read and is wholeheartedly recommended to anyone who is interested in reading a classic. <br />  <br />
B00003CXCT|3.0|Look, I love Star Wars just as much as the next geek, but I have a problem with the DVD edition. While the added detail in the background of places like cloud city is a sweet addition and adds to the reality of the film's world; and while the video quality is so phenomenal that your jaw will drop all over again; and while the effects are, clearly, the best possible Star Wars expeirience, the \\"cover-up\\" nature of the campaign speaks volumes. Neither the advertising and promotional material, nor the actual box text mentions the fact that the dvd is the special edition. They are reffered to as \\"all three classic films\\" and \\"all three original films\\" in the text. They're not.<br /><br />Now don't misunderstand me, even though Greedo shooting first is just plain wrong, I respect Lucas' right to revise and re-interpret his work, but pretending the spec-ed IS the original is revisionism.<br /><br />Also, they put the actor from ep. II and III into the \\"force ghost\\" sequence at the end of jedi over the actor who played Vader. Bush league!
B0007OY2MG|5.0|Only A short paragraph needed to describe season three......... the best! My most favorite thing about this season is seeing even more of the most gorgeous man ever.... Milo Ventimiglia! So even if you didn't like Gilmore Girls the first time around give it a second chance mainly because of the gorgeous man!
B000003S5H|5.0|First of all, how can one say that a cracker of a song called \\"All I Need\\" reminds him of Zero 7, when it is clear and obvious that the whole landscape and sounds of Zero 7 are totally Air-rip-offs. \\"When It Falls\\" can be dsecribed as being a class-b(or perhaps c or d)-version of \\"Moon Safari\\". <br /> <br />Anyway, about the album itself. It starts with the classic \\"La Femme d'Argent\\", which with it's groovy bassline and great droppy organs creates simultaniously a cool and pleasantly dangerous atmosphere. Second track \\"Sexy Boy\\", is a great tune and manages also to be hilarious at the same time. \\"All I Need\\" offers a welcome break with the excellent Beth Hirsch at vocals. The album continues solidly throughout, bar one slight nudge - \\"Remember\\", which would have been better without the vocoder bits in the beginning. Highlights of the album are the aforementioned accompanied with the likes of \\"Talisman\\" - same as \\"La Femme d'Argent, supercool and invitingly dangerous, \\"You Make It Easy\\" - which will definitely be played at my wedding!, \\"Ce Matin La\\" - the song makes you feel like there's nothing wrong in the world, everything is simple etc. Superb tuba and harmonica. <br /> <br />My own favourite from the album has to be \\"Ce Matin La\\", which sort of crystallizes the whole album - excellent atmosphere, songcraft and even very stylish covers!
B00005JNQQ|4.0|OK, maybe it's not as good as Finding Nemo, but it is almost as visually striking.  One of the most fun things about this movie is the world it creates.  It's true, the plot is a bit thin - Rodney Copperbottom comes to Robot City to live out his dream of becoming an inventor and must fight an evil corporation.  However, there are enough jokes and pop-culture references to keep things moving along briskly.  A lot of the criticism of the film centers on Robin Williams doing his same old thing.  Well, I like Robin Williams's routine and I didn't find it boring.  I don't think that any little children will find it boring either.

0124297854|5.0|Learning organic chemistry has always been about acquiring a comprehensive knowledge of chemical behavior and with this as the backdrop, to consider the principles, theoretical and mechanistical basis of the subject. In this context, the named reactions in organic chemistry provide one with a historical feel for the subject, is an easy tool to remember the myriad functional group transformations and thus create a love for this fascinating chemistry. <br /> <br />When I saw this book by Laszlo and Barbara, I was just amazed at the amount of labor that has gone into producing, what I believe, is one of the finest books ever written on named reactions in organic chemistry. It is not just another name reactions book, as it can also be considered a reaction mechanisms book, since the authors have drawn out elaborately, the mechanistic schemes / reaction pathways for every single reaction and you wouldn't believe, it lists a multitude of 250 named reactions! What strikes me most is that this book can cater to anybody, from an undergraduate who is trying to learn and love the art of Organic chemistry to a graduate student who is trying to learn complicated reaction mechanisms and also to chemists with a MS or PhD who want to strategically apply these in synthetic reactions. <br /> <br />One of the many salient points of this book, which I really liked, is the way references have been treated. It has been classified into reviews, seminal publications and applications. So a reader doesn't have to delve through a large number of refs in the library and find out what he likes. Every name reaction has its historical background listed, followed by the mechanism, drawn with differing / appealing colors for the appropriate bond disconnections, and finally synthetic applications; and take my word, the authors have taken pains to show the latest and most appropriate synthetic applications that have appeared in the scientific literature. <br /> <br />No wonder then that two of the living giants of modern synthetic chemistry (E. J. Corey & K. C. Nicolaou) have written the introduction and foreword to this beautiful book, which outshines and outdoes every name reactions book previously written. <br /> <br />Hearty congratulations to the authors for this marvelous effort and I would highly recommend this book to everyone who hold organic chemistry dear to their heart!!!!! <br />

0767840135|5.0|I just finished viewing \\"La Nouba\\" and I have to say that it displaces \\"O\\" as my second favorite Cirque du Soleil show. \\"Quidam\\" remains my favorite and the gold standard against which all other shows must be measured. In addition to these three, I've seen \\"Mystere\\", \\"Zumanity\\", \\"KA\\", \\"Varekai\\", \\"Alegria\\", \\"Saltimbanco\\", and \\"Dralion\\". It's no coincidence that my top three picks are all creations of Franco Dragone, who unfortunately, has left the company. All three also feature the music of Benoit Jutras. The artistry, surrealism, visual imagery, and music are all earmarks of a Dragone/Jutras show. There are some similarities between Quidam and La Nouba which might be the reason they are my favorites. They share some of the same acts such as the \\"German Wheel\\" and \\"Diabolos\\". The German Wheel acts are a bit different because in Quidam, there is only one wheel whereas in La Nouba, there are two. The result is that the single performer in Quidam maintains a faster, more acrobatic, pace where the duo in La Nouba act in sync. The Diabolos acts are virtually identical in both shows, except that Quidam's version has a spectacular ending that is lacking in La Nouba's. In both shows, the finale is the main event of the show - \\"Banquine\\" in Quidam and \\"Power Track (PT)/Trampoline\\" in La Nouba. Although \\"PT/Trampoline\\" is absolutely superb, \\"Banquine\\" remains my favorite of any act in any Cirque show. The combination of artistry, music, costumes, and unbelievable acrobatic ability in Banquine is sheer perfection. The weakest acts are the \\"Cloud Swing\\" in Quidam and \\"Cycles\\" in La Nouba. I've never really liked the clown acts in any of the Cirque shows and these two are no exception. Most Cirque shows have one or possibly two acts that are good enough to be the main event. La Nouba has two - \\"PT/Trampoline\\" and \\"Flying Trapeze\\". Quidam has three - \\"Banquine\\", \\"Skipping Ropes\\", and \\"Statue\\". Most main event acts feature large casts of at least 8-10 people and usually more. \\"Statue\\" is perhaps the only main event-quality act that has only two people. The one other advantage that Quidam has over La Nouba, at least on DVD, is the singing voice of Audrey Brisson-Jutras who is the daughter of musical composer Jutras. The lead vocalist in La Nouba is amazing, but there is something magical and haunting about Audrey's voice that sends chills up my spine every time I view Quidam. The reason that \\"O\\" drops to third place is that, as wonderful a show as it is artistically, the acrobatics are weak compared to most other shows. \\"O\\" does not contain a main event-quality acrobatic act. One other difference between Quidam and La Nouba is that La Nouba, with acts such as \\"High Wire\\", \\"Balancing on Chairs\\", and \\"Flying Trapeze\\" more closely resembles a traditional circus than Quidam. Both Quidam and La Nouba are \\"must have\\" DVDs for anyone who enjoys the Cirque du Soleil.

B00008DDXC|5.0|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was an amazing film. This sequel is even better. <br /> <br />This film is not only funnier, and more fun than the first, it is much darker, and full of suspense and action. <br /> <br />Any Harry Potter fans should see this.
B0007DAZW8|3.0|People who buy this album expecting another Discovery are going to be very disappointed. I don't know what happened to DP but somewhere along the way since Discovery they seem to have gotten bitter, darker. The songs are still funky, and I welcome the darker mood, but I think everyone would agree that the amazing thing about Discovery is that many tracks on it force people to smile. Even people who don't like electronic or disco. This album does not have that power. Songs have little to no build and they are overly repetitive. Daft Punk was already repetitive, but most of these songs don't have enough to merit 2 minutes of the same loop and then only a minor change in the bridge. I rarely change tracks on my first listen of a CD, but this got so repetitive at some points that I actually did. (Later I went back and made myself relisten, hoping I had missed something...I hadn't)<br /><br />There IS a lot of good stuff here, and Daft Punk hasn't lost their funk or style at all. It just feels to me that these tracks are incomplete; lacking one or two layers or maybe a strong melody to make the songs cohesive. The lack of tracks (really only 9 songs on the album) is also EXTREMELY disappointing.<br /><br />People are claiming that criticism against the album comes from lack of an open mind and refusal to accept the groups evolution. But this isn't new ground for them, a lot of the work on the album feels like a throw back to their less mature, more repetitive Homework days. I have no doubt that Daft Punk will put out some more Discovery quality work, but as for this album, the best tracks live up to maybe the second tier tracks on Discovery. Oh well. It's worth buying if you like them a lot, and there ARE a few moments on the album that make it worth it, but maybe Discovery was called Discovery because on every track some moment catches you off guard and makes you feel good. For humans, this is surprisingly less spontaneous and developing than their robot music.
B00005JN2Z|2.0|This movie at first glance is very cool. After you watch it, it holds a terrible emptiness. What do we learn? Nothing. The ending was deppressing. The last line we hear is \\"a man goes into a subway, sits down, and dies. Who's gonna notice?\\"  <br /> <br />A truly sad and hopeless film, \\"with some cool action.\\" :)
B0007P3582|1.0|First off, I must say that this was a terrible album, esp. a follow-up of a classic, blazin debut album. I loved GRODT and The Massacre was just whack. A true Shady/Aftermath/G-Unit fan will be disappointed with this album. <br /> <br />1. Intro - no rating <br />2. In My Hood - dumb intro to this album 5/10 <br />3. This is 50 - corny song; the worst has only started 3/10 <br />4. I'm Supposed to Die Tonight - another bad song!! 4/10 <br />5. Piggy Bank - weak diss to everybody who has beef with him; his Ja Rule disses on GRODT were actually effective. And the beat sucks too!! 7/10 <br />6. Gatman and Robbin (featuring Eminem) - This was the only great song on the album. If this song and Game's \\"We Ain't\\" were on Eminem's \\"Encore\\", maybe that album would not have sucked as much. 9/10 <br />7. Candy Shop (featuring Olivia) - Loved it the week it came out, but got overplayed too fast on radio, MTV and any other music-related stuff you can think of. originally 9/10 now 3/10 <br />8. Outta Control - BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM!!! This album should have included more production by Dr. Dre 15/10 <br />9. Get In My Car - cheap ripoff of \\"P.I.M.P.\\" 4/10 <br />10. Ski Mask Way - yet another skippable track. 2/10 <br />11. A Baltimore Love Thing - This is one song I can relate to, so I'll give 50 porps for this. 8.5/10 <br />12. Ryder Music - I am a gasngster who is NOT riding to it. 5/10 <br />13. Disco Inferno - another overrated song that sucks. If you catch the video on BET Uncut, just watch it and keep the TV on mute because the song is bad!!. 2/10 (+5 because of the video, so 7/10)  <br />14. Just A Lil Bit - a catchy beat with production by Scott Storch, who produced the first single \\"Candy Shop\\". 7.5/10 <br />15. Gunz Come Out - another Dr. Dre-produced joint. 9/10 <br />16. My Toy Soldier (featuring Tony Yayo) - terrible recreation of Eminem's \\"Toy Soldiers\\"; Ray Benzino's Toy Soldiers response, \\"Look Into My Eyes\\" is a better song, and sadly, that's not saying much <br/>17. Position Of Power - another skippable track. 3/10 <br />18. Build You Up (featuring Jamie Foxx) - all right song. JF's appearance on Twista's \\"Slow Jamz\\" was better. This is one of those songs that should have had Nate Dogg. 6.5/10  <br />19. God Gave Me Style - an extremely great, catchy song but I wish He gave him the style on this album that he did on GRODT. 8/10 <br />20. So Amazing (featuring Olivia) - better song than Candy Shop; end of discussion. 9/10 <br />21. I Don't Need Em - if you seen All Eyes on 50 Cent Part 2 on MTV, you'll hear Fat Joe saying that he disses everybody but himself. I get the feeling that he is secretly attempting to diss Eminem. This song suck either way anyway. 4/10 <br />22. Hate It Or Love It (Remix featuring G-Unit) - the remix was aiight, but the regular version (The Game featuring 50 Cent) is much better. 7/10
0679745653|5.0|Breakfast At Tiffany's is a truly one of a kind novel, not to mention a major pop culture phenomenon.  It truly mirrors the changes that occurred to American society after World War II.  The novel gives a glimpse to the reader what it was like for woman and how their roles in society changed. It's a great tale of human nature as well as overcoming adversity.<br /><br />One becomes enthralled and entranced by the infamous character, Holly Golightly.  She, without a doubt, is defining of a cultured woman of the American 1950's, a contemporary debutant, carefree and aloof.  This former starlit actress moves into the narrator's (or \\"Fred\\" as Holly refers to him as) apartment building, just a floor down from his apartment.  After Holly climbs threw his fire escape to avoid a man who is biting her, they become instant friends seemingly over night. Holly is not a perfect person, but because her flaws are bared for all to see, she is a much more identifiable and loveable character.<br /><br />Her wild like qualities make her irresistible to every man she comes in contact with, which doesn't omit \\"Fred\\", either.  Over the course of the story, he falls madly in love with the fiercely independent Holly.  Definitely a quintessential case of misguided love.<br /><br /> In addition to Breakfast at Tiffany's, there are three short stories that go along with the motif of human nature.  House of Flowers, A Diamond Guitar, and A Christmas Memory play off of each other, as well as Breakfast At Tiffany's.  Each short story relates to how people communicate their emotions with one another.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|A few of my friends first told me to listen to this recording, but, for a time, I didn't listen to it, because I thought (mistakingly) that it would just be a childish representation of the book.  How wrong was I!  The passion that the two leads (Kristis Chenoweth and  Idina Menzel) give stellar performances, combining remarkable voices and amazing harmonies together.  However, one element seems to be seems to be overlooked when reviewing any musical - the chorus is simply fantastic on this soundtrack.  Every person is blended, men and women and it creates the best sound in a background choir that I have ever heard.  Splendid work!

0064430227|5.0|Harold is a toddler who can make real objects by drawing them with his purple crayon. This simple device is the springboard for a series of adventures that will captivate and charm reader and listener alike.     For example, when he is trying to find his way back home, he draws a policeman so that he can ask for directions. But the policeman just points in the direction that Harold was going anyway, so he walks on, trying to figure a way home.     Harold's drawings are all childlike, but other than Harold himself, there are no other more realistic pictures to measure them against. Harold himself never speaks, so the text is all provided by simple narration.     Fifty years after it was first published, this book is still delighting parents and children; it's difficult to put your finger on exactly what makes this series work so well, but work it does. I'm not sure that the concept holds up well throughout the enormous series, but the idea is fresh and exciting in this series opener, and some of the other earlier books.

B00067BBQE|3.0|It took me several weeks to watch the entire \\"Anywhere But Home\\" DVD\\".  The MTV-esque editing is obviously loathed by everyone over the age of 16.  Setting that aside, I simply couldn't believe how bad Amy Lee sounded.  How could she sound so amazing on their album, and so poor in concert?  (God, please don't say Ashlee Simpson).  I thought maybe the first couple of songs she was just nervous and would get into her stride.  Her breathing was off, she tried to stay in the lower part of her range, and just sounded weak.  She's much better in the upper octaves.  After the first few songs, she did sound a little better.  The audience sing-along was lame and took away the opportunity for Amy to prove she can sing live.  All the kiddies in the audience were crooning and swooning, but look at the faces of some of the \\"older\\" people.  Some are standing with their arms crossed and a look of \\"what the f...?\\" on their faces!! <br /> <br />The best part of the DVD, besides the end was the videos.  They helped restore some of my faith in Evanescence.  The behind the scenes stuff was mostly juvenile and consisted of mooning and fart jokes.  The bloopers section was pretty funny though. <br />Evanescence has a huge obstacle to overcome with their second album - their first album.  We'll see if they can actually do better, or if they go the way of so many two album bands. <br /> <br />I would have rated the DVD lower, but I'm still in denial that Amy sounded so BAD.  Maybe it's my stereo.  That's gotta be it.  I'll get back to you.......
B000062YAZ|5.0|How long has it been since I last wrote a review? MONTHS! Ok? Months. What did I do in those months? I was searching for something awesome to review, and after many months I come across this. Reign In Blood is slowly making its way into my top 5 albums, and this review will prove why: <br /> <br />Angel Of Death - 5/5: Great intro, at first I didnt like it but after I heard Tom Araya's scream I was certain this was gonna be amazing. The music is uncomparable in this song, Tom's vocals are the finest that I've heard in a while. The solo is a bit strange but overall an outstanding opener. <br /> <br />Piece By Piece - 4.5/5: Good track, not as good as the first but done pretty well. Kind of hard to get used to. <br /> <br />Necrophobic - 5/5: The vocals are the highlight of this song, yet the music is just a bit better. It changes tempo mid-way and that easily made it into one of my favorite tracks. <br /> <br />Altar Of Sacrifice - 4/5: Araya's singing are superb here. The music is pretty cool as well, Only one flow, the solos. They're a bit lame. <br /> <br />Jesus Saves - 4.5/5: Love the way this track blends with the last. Nothing much to say here except that its hard to make out what Araya is saying. Good track. <br /> <br />Criminally Insane - 5/5: This song is amazing. Nothing in it that isnt good. The solo here is cool, fast but cool. <br /> <br />Reborn - 4.5/5: Really fast track here. Very good parts of it. This is the first song that made me really interested in what the lyrics are about. Must hear!! <br /> <br />Epidemic - 5/5: Breathtaking, really life-killing track. Excellent as Hell, especially the solo. <br /> <br />Postmortem - 5/5: This track is more Heavy than Thrash but that doesnt make it bad. Its more like a build-up to the next song. Just listen to the way it ends, it clearly shows that the end isnt here yet, which leads to... <br /> <br />Raining Blood - 5/5: KILLER TRACK!!!!! Best song on the album. Everything (vocals and music) is outstanding. The first solo is really good while the second is more strange. The intro to this song (heavy rain(blood)fall) really puts a mood in this track. It even ends in bloodfall. Overall, best track on the album! <br /> <br />*Bonus Tracks: <br />Aggressive Perfector - 5/5: Wow! This is just as good as the original stuff. Really heavy. Glad to see it on the reamstered version. <br /> <br />Criminally Insane (Remix) - 3/5: Not bad, but really gloomy. Fair addition to the album. <br /> <br />Lineup: <br />Kerry King - Guitars <br />Jeff Hanneman - Guitars <br />Tom Araya - Vocals, Bass <br />Dave Lombardo - Drums <br /> <br />Overall: This is perhaps the finest Thrash Metal album out there today. Its amazingly evil (in a good way) and its a must for all Metal fans. Do not miss your chance.
B00005MCX0|5.0|I came to Hawkwind through their live cd \\"Space Ritual\\", which is one of the outstanding live cds of all time. This studio cd is from about the same time period, and is the only cd that replicates the power of Hawkwind's live performances. <br /> <br />The opening cut, \\"You Shouldn't Do That\\", (which clocks in at 15:41!) is a good test of whether you are or are not going to be a Hawkwind fan.  Many of my friends find the song boring and repetitive - but in fact it makes good use of a repeated themes intermixed with background variations, and is in the same league as songs like \\"The Sheltering Sky\\" by King Crimson. The next three cuts keep things moving at a nice pace.  \\"We Took the Wrong Step Years Ago\\" is particularly noteworthy - it is a powerful acoustic song that in some ways reminds me of some of the acoustic pieces on Led Zepplin's zoso cd (Led Zepplin 4).  The final two cuts on the cd are a bit weaker, and the three bonus tracks, while good enough, are hardly essential (though one of these, \\"Silver Machine\\", has achieved near legendary status among some Hawkwind fans because of a rumored live cut of the song that was apparently left off the \\"Space Ritual\\" cd. <br /> <br />The question mark in my review refers to the fact that I have yet to listen to any Hawkwind cd more recent than \\"Quark, Strangeness, and Charm\\".  Certainly \\"In Search of Space\\" is their best early studio effort, and though not perfect, it is well deserving of a five star rating.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|This was another brilliant album one of their best if not best! <br />
B000002UA0|4.0|\\"The Piper At the Gates of Dawn\\" is the one Pink Floyd cd where original member Syd Barrett is in command.  Shortly after the release of this cd he would flame out and disappear from the group, which was then \\"taken over\\" by Roger Waters, and later by David Gilmore.  This cd is an acquired taste - but for those who can get into Barrett's bent take on music the songs here are a real treat.  Of particular note are the first and last cuts - \\"Astronomy Domine\\" which is weird beyond belief, but excellent (as is the live version appearing on \\"Ummagumma\\") and \\"Bike\\", an equally weird love song.  The song between these bookends are consistently interesting, particularly the instrumental song \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\".  If you are a fan of later period Pink Floyd give this cd a listen or two - you are likely to come around.
0790729385|5.0|This movie if watched late at night alone will with out a doubt have you freaked out. I dont need to go into detail about it as others will. But this movie is very scarey and is not for everyone not many people can sit through the movie, even watch it. Its offensive in certain parts just probably the best #1 horror ever made, if you never seen it  go rent it first, and I only say rent it first because if you buy it and watch it, you might never watch it agian if you cant handle the type of movie it is, then you wasted your money. And in all this movie is far from a waste of money. Worth every penny for me cause i can watch this movie over and over and every time it gives me the chills an makes my hair stand just creepy scary , you name it. Great movie.
B00008BXJF|5.0|Thirty years or more after the first King Crimson band, Robert Fripp and friends (Adrian Belew, Trey Gunn and Pat Mastelotto this time round) came up with another masterpiece with \\"The Power To Believe\\" in 2003. Intelligent lyrics by Adrian Belew, astounding musicianship and quirky time signatures are some of the qualities that could lead to a label of  \\"contemporary progressive rock\\". On the other hand, the mature sophistication and sheer energy of the band transcends such a categorization.<br /><br />A very wide range of emotions and atmospheres are explored in the songs and instrumentals. The title track, a short and beautiful poem, is used to great effect in various different versions. \\"Eyes Wide Open\\" has an upbeat melodic eighties Crimson feel. \\"Dangerous Curves\\" is an excellent semi-classical instrumental with echoes of \\"Mars\\" from \\"The Planets Suite\\" by Holst. \\"Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With\\" is a brilliant ironic slab of heavy metal with very very funny lyrics.<br /><br />One of the best albums to be released under the name of \\"King Crimson\\", although very different to many earlier releases. An absolutely superb collection of high quality, intelligent, heartfelt, rock music by men who are old enough to know better!
B0006SSOHC|4.0|About six or so months ago \\"Saw\\" was the four hundred pound gorilla rampaging through several of the horror websites I frequent. Every other day brought new photos, new links to trailers, new behind the scenes stories, and new conjectures all pointing to the incredible potential of this movie. Those insiders lucky enough to view the film before its general release spoke in reverent tones about the carnage we all would soon see with \\"Saw.\\" They furthermore whispered words like \\"giallo\\" and \\"Argento\\" to describe the stylistic aspects of the movie. Needless to say I wanted to see this picture in the worst way after reading such high praise: I love films larded with gory carnage, love gialli, and think Dario Argento is one of the great horror masters of the modern age. Sadly, seeing \\"Saw\\" in the theater would not become a reality for me. In a tradeoff with my girlfriend that I will rue until the day I die, I agreed to attend a screening of the pedestrian \\"The Forgotten\\" instead of \\"Saw.\\" I just got my revenge, however, by forcing her to watch the DVD edition of a film that I consider one of the best new horror films to come down the pike in quite some time.<br /><br />\\"Saw\\" begins by introducing us to two characters who will come to dominate most of the film's screen time: Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes). The two men awake to find themselves chained to pipes in a phenomenally grungy bathroom with little knowledge of how they got there or why they are there. Then they start discovering clues: a corpse clutching a tape recorder and pistol lies in a pool of blood in the center of the room, envelopes containing cassette tapes lie in their pockets, hacksaws soon turn up, and a camera watches them from behind a two way mirror. It's obvious someone with a sick sense of humor placed these guys in this room with a purpose in mind, and that purpose gradually comes to the fore with horrific implications. Dr. Gordon suddenly recalls a series of incidents a few months before involving a serial killer named Jigsaw, a killer whose victims perish in extraordinarily graphic ways. It turns out that this murderer isn't an average stalk and slash psychopath, however, but a cunning sadist who thinks his mission is to teach others the value of life. He does so by placing them in traps that require the subject to overcome their flaws in order to escape. Adam and Gordon are definitely caught up in Jigsaw's latest shenanigans.<br /><br />Most of what we learn in \\"Saw\\" comes from flashbacks from Adam and Gordon. We learn that a Detective Tapp (Danny Glover) and his fellow investigators on the force tried to pin the crimes on Dr. Gordon when they linked a piece of evidence to the good doctor. We also discover that Gordon has a lot of family problems with his daughter and wife. Heck, it isn't too long before we realize that nearly every major character--Tapp, Adam, Gordon, and a couple of others--possesses some secret that hints at the possibility that any of these guys could be Jigsaw. And we learn more about Jigsaw, his strange philosophy, his haunts, and his stomach churning props. This killer locked one of his victims, Amanda (Shawnee Smith), in a helmet that could tear her head apart and demanded she look for the key in the most unusual of places. He's a warped, warped individual, but he's also a guy who keeps his word. If his victim escapes from his scheme they are free to reenter society, hopefully with a better outlook on the importance of life. \\"He helped me,\\" claims Amanda, and it's disturbing to realize you understand exactly what she means.<br /><br />Jigsaw's philosophy is one of only a large number of massively disturbing elements in \\"Saw,\\" but it's one of the more interesting ones. People say his stance on life mirrors the film \\"Seven,\\" and perhaps that is so. I saw a greater similarity between Jigsaw's tortures and the scene in \\"Fight Club\\" where Tyler Durden uses the threat of death to force a young convenience store clerk to follow his dream of becoming a veterinarian instead of wallowing in apathy. The idea is to get people to wake up and start appreciating each and every day. If it takes a barbed wire trap or a bear trap helmet to bring the sheep to their senses, so be it. \\"Saw\\" offers us more than mere mental gymnastics, fortunately, including Cary Elwes hamming it up as the coolly aloof Gordon, a very creepy puppet used to great effect, and a scene with a flashbulb taken right out of the original \\"Texas Chain Saw Massacre.\\" In fact, \\"Saw\\" rips off a lot of stuff from other classic horror films, but it does so in way that didn't bother me. Frankly, I like to see a movie paying homage once in awhile. What did surprise me was the gore, or lack thereof. This is the unrated cut? Where's the sauce? There are a few nasty surprises but \\"Saw\\" keeps most of the grue safely out of camera range. Pity.<br /><br />Extras on the widescreen edition disc disappoint. I kicked back before starting the behind the scenes feature, figuring that the whole thing would take twenty or thirty minutes to play out. It took TWO AND A HALF MINUTES! Then there's a music video and a short documentary about making the music video. The poster gallery and trailers section don't break new ground, nor does the commentary track from director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell. Who wants to bet a double dip special edition DVD will arrive in stores soon? Any takers? Nevertheless, \\"Saw\\" is definitely worth a watch; it's a fine film that blows away most of the mainstream horror coming out today.ce store clerk to follow his dream of becoming a veterinarian instead of wallowing in apathy.

B0001ZMWQO|4.0|With great lyrics and an all-around adrenalizing sound tempered by moody moments and well-placed change-ups, Franz Ferdinand makes and strong break onto the modern music scene. Full of clever hooks, these peculiar rockers echo the indy-pop stylings of Modest Mouse and others that have crossed the line over to mainstream-but-still-artsy stardom. A solid album
B0002X314C|4.0|Much needed in the industry. <br /> <br />But honestly, is it me, or is music so bad now that we \\"celebrate\\" artists that use a throwback style to yesteryear, but not really \\"elevating\\" the music to \\"new\\" levels? <br /> <br />I love the honesty of this album, but it's a rehashed theme of yesteryear.  Good album, but I can't think there's anything wrong with expecting black music to elevate itself to another level.  This album stands out because of the trash heap it's measured against, but I can't call it \\"great\\" on par with the \\"greatness\\" of many of our 70's and 80's soul artists.
B00000IWVS|5.0|Martha Argerich recorded this Chopin recital soon after her triumph in the 1965 Warsaw Chopin competition. This exciting disc, though done in the studio, has the feel of a live performance, partly due to the somewhat opaque sound and partly due to an occasional spot of slightly untidy execution that only adds to the excitement of these white-hot performances. Argerich's blazing technique welds together the first movement of the B minor Sonata, which can sound loose and sprawling in other hands. The fearlessness and elan that won her an international career is much in evidence in the fast movements of the Sonata, the C-sharp minor Scherzo, and the A-flat Polonaise that concludes this recording, while the Largo, the Mazurkas and the Nocturne display her consummate musicianship and ability to sustain a musical line. Suppressed for decades, this CD is most welcome, better late than never, as a portrait of a great pianist in her early glory.
0790730960|5.0|Batman Returns(1992)- This is the greatest and darkest comic book film ever made.  It establishes a Batman mythos that carries into the comic books. The film examines the psychological motives behind each characters actions.  Michael Keaton returns as Batman, putting his stamp on the character forever. Also, Tim Burton is back as director, adding his unique twist to the franchise.  This movie has the best and most unforgetable performances, costumes, and directing of all four movies.  Christopher Walken is great as the manipulative Max Shreck.  He really influences the actions of the other rogues and is essentially the main villan in the film. Danny Devito is both dark and funny as the grotesque Penguin. His story is well developed in this film.  In addition, Michelle Pheiffer plays the Catwoman.  She makes this character her own as much as Keaton makes Batman his own.  The relationship between Batman and Catwoman is the most intriguing in all comic book genre films.  This film takes the momentum started by the original and takes it further. It surpasses Batman(1989) in almost every aspect.<br /><br />As a sidenote did you know that Robin was originally in the script of both Batman and Batman Returns, but was later cut out in order to preserve the solitary darkness of the Batman character.  For example, if you look at the Batman Returns toy series from Kenner, Robin action figures are included.  Also a Michelle Pheiffer/Catwoman feature was supposed to have followed Batman Returns.  However, the project never materialized.  In the film before Selina kills Shreck, she says she has two lives left and that she'll save one for the following Christmas.<br /><br />(10 of 10)
B0007VZ9DK|5.0|It's about time for a special edition I bought the heat transfer version because I love the movie it didn't have any special features back then because it was the best quality for the movie. So when this comes out I'm going to sell the heat transfer and get this one.
B0002F7I9Y|1.0|I bought this CD all excited hoping to hear a duet with Ray Charles and Hillary Duff, Lindsay Lohan, Spice Girls, Hanson, and the legendary Aqua. I was SOOOOOO disappointed because this ray charles guy didn't sing pop music first of all....ugh.....and then he did duets with worthless people. I honestly think that a duet with Ray Charles and Hillary Duff would sell millions of records PERIOD! So to warn you before you buy this CD, it may look like your typical pop album, but it's not...bummer!
0312305060|5.0|I decided to write this brief review as an apology to Mr. Cunningham, for having ever doubted his abilities. I approached \\"The Hours\\" with a degree of skepticism. Maybe, on a subconscious level, I didn't think I could relate to a novel about three women. Stupid, I realize, but I can think of no other explanations. In any case, I was wrong. <br /> <br />Cunningham has penned a modern, literary masterpiece. His style, while a little too flowery for my tastes, meshes well with his story. Indeed, his command of the English language is intimidating: Cunningham's work has the air of a master poet who has decided to turn his skill to prose. The following excerpt, chosen more-or-less at random, illustrates the point: <br /> <br />\\"Only the heel of that foot, one hand, and one fleshless buttock remain in contact with the battered wood. On his robe, red-finned rockets emit perfect orange pinecones of fire. Helmeted astronauts, plump and white as the Uniroyal Man, faceless behind their dark visors, offer stiff, white-gloved salutes.\\" <br /> <br />The story behind \\"The Hours\\" is simple to the point of deception: a woman prepares a celebration for her sick, poet friend, a woman bakes a cake for her husband's birthday, and Virginia Woolf battles painful headaches while writing \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\" But these three women share a complex bond they will never fully understand.  <br /> <br />It is a rare achievement for an author to extract the profound from the seemingly mundane. \\"The Hours\\" is one of those rare achievements, \\"a cut above the rest,\\" worth reading, discussing, and re-reading.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|...but I agree, this album is a bit overhyped. There are plenty of talented artists out there with better lyrics, music, whatever. Mostly I hear this band associated the Killers, but the Killers are flat out pop trying to be indie (although I do admit to liking some of their songs...dead catchy, they are). This CD features quite a few good songs, and, as I've said, is a great dance record. You know those days where you just want something to get you moving, cheer you up, sort of. My favorite track would have to be \\"Michael\\", hands down, because it's funny, witty, and so energetic. Better than \\"Take Me Out\\", IMO. The guitar work is nothing new, and the vocalist's voice is typical, similar to the likes of Interpol. Overall, four stars. Nothing spetacular, but enough to warrant a recommendation. Just don't buy it because of all the hype...or the fact that they were invited to the Grammy's.
B00005U122|3.0|Don't get me wrong..this is a great concert, great repertoire.  However, I have to say that although the option for 5.1 surround sound appears on the menu, what you get is only sound from the two front speakers and the subwoofer.  No sound comes from the central speaker and surround sound speakers. <br /> <br />One past review mentioned this...he is right.  I would have loved for this music to come on real 5.1 surround sound but it still sounds good though...2.1 surround sound maybe....that's why I give it only 3 stars. <br /> <br />
B0002KVUKM|1.0|&#34;Van Helsing&#34; (2004) should have been an enjoyable homage to the classic Universal horror films of the 1930s. Unfortunately, the finished product is an overblown, effects-laden disaster. Not even Hugh Jackman can redeem this sordid enterprise. It's enough to make Bela Lugosi and Edward Van Sloan (the original Professor Van Helsing) spin in their graves.
0743454529|5.0|My Sister's Keeper is a book I could not put down. I read it in less than twenty-four hours and loved every minute of it. Picoult explores the moral delimna of a family whose life revolves around a very sick young girl. When the daughter who was created to be a genetic match decides to sue for her medical independence, the family is forced to explore their roles in the family and how difficult it has been to face death around every corner.  <br /> <br />I read other reviews that blasted the ending, but I have to say that while it was unexpected, sad and unwanted, the ending left me feeling glad that I took a chance on this book. I'm looking forward to reading more of Picoult's works.
6305903182|5.0|I always thought that after Scream was made they would'nt make anymore. But I am so glad they did. Scream 2&3 are the best sequals ever made. Scream 3 didn't have as much gore in it as the first movie had, or the second one for that matter. All of the \\"Screams\\" are great but Scream 3 is the BEST!!!
B0001GF2DS|5.0|If foley artistry intrigues you like it does me, this film is definitly full of interesting techniques, and has it's share of \\"artifacts.\\" <br /> <br />Aside from the fact that it's an old \\"Spaghetti Western\\" which was a joint venture between Italy and US actors, there is the issue of the dubbing, which in the remastered version has been cleaned up tremendously. The remastering artists did a wonderful job correcting many problems with the previous dubs, including insert pink noise, voices and other effects to help mask some of the original artifacts. <br /> <br />All in all, with the original Mono track in italian laying side by side with the English (A rarity with R1 discs), this is definitly a treat!
0440236738|5.0|I've just started reading Coben's books.  This was my third in as many weeks.  I've read many other authors of this genre: Dan Brown, Nevada Barr, Janet Evanovich, Michael Connelly, etc.  Coben proves again, for me at least, that he is the master of this craft, surpassing his peers by creating tension and excitement that don't cease.  The action is riveting, the characters worthy of my attention, and the plot is well crafted and unpredictable enough to maintain suspense throughout the text.  When I forced myself to pull away from this book to get on with my life, I found myself smiling at how deftly Coben scripted this tale. <br />   I write how-to books and articles (about poker).  If I were teaching someone how to write a novel, this would be my instructive text -- so perfectly are the paragraphs and the chapters constructed.  Bravo Mr. Coben.  You do your Amherst education proud! <br />     <br />
B0007P3582|4.0|The saddest thing about haters is that you all fell in 50's trap lol. You all bought the album and he sold over a millionn in 4 days. You shouldn't buy the thing , and buy buying it it'll put more trash out lol and by buying the game's album it's still more money in his piggy bank (ooh did I say that lol)
B00005JNQQ|4.0|There's no question this movie is absolutely stunning to look at.  William Joyce, the \\"designer\\" is one of my favorite children's book authors (\\"George Shrinks,\\" \\"Dinosaur Bob and the Family Lazardo,\\" \\"Santa Calls.\\") .  His books have a sleek, retro look that is clearly an inspiration for the look of this movie.  The idea of an essentially metallic world is wonderfully suited to CGI animation.  Smooth, reflective surfaces show off the technology best. <br /> <br />There are some wonderous bits in this movie, detailing a world populated by robots.  Our main character begins life not as a newborn, but as box of robot parts that his mom & dad must put together.  As he \\"ages,\\" he is fitted with bigger and bigger parts, until he's grown up.  That's a cute idea.  When young Copperbottom (voiced by Ewan McGregor) makes his arrival in \\"the big city,\\" he is taken on a ride through the public transportation system that is remarkable, clever and a great example of why seeing movies on a big screen is still so important. <br /> <br />I found myself smiling at the invention in the movie all the time, and chuckling at a lot of the ideas.  When robots wake up in the morning, instead of a cup of coffee, they enjoy a cuppa hot grease which they pour on their weary bodies.   <br /> <br />The movie has plenty of gags for kids too: gas jokes in particular. <br /> <br />But to me, what the movie lacks is a true heart.  The story, of a young kid moving to the big city and nearly being left disillusioned, only to lead an \\"assault\\" against the bad guys running things, feels uninspired and uninvolving.  Who cares?  When we have our inevitable \\"tear-jerker\\" ending, none of my tears were jerked.  I haven't really grown to care about the characters...the filmmakers haven't earned that.  They've wowed us technically (really wowed!), made us laugh, but they haven't sucked us in.  We watch the robot world from the outside, at arms length. <br /> <br />The reason so many past CGI movies are such classics is because of their almost miraculous melding of incredible visuals with a story that can break your heart...remember the TOY STORY movies?  FINDING NEMO?  MONSTERS, INC.? ICE AGE?  Frankly, TOY STORY set the standard of tech/emotion melding, and if a movie falls short of that...it just doesn't get my five-star endorsement.  ROBOTS is superior to the boring SHARK TALES...but it left me somewhat cold, much like A BUG'S LIFE or ANTZ.  And it makes me worry that the artform is becoming less special.  Once upon a time, one movie a year of this wonderful new art was available to us.  Now we get several a year.  Let's slow it down a little. <br /> <br />Speaking of slowing down, another part of ROBOTS that bugs me is the sometimes frantic pace.  You almost feel the flop-sweats of the filmmakers trying not to let a single moment go by without frantic activity,loud noises and eye-popping visuals.  And Robin Williams, in a lead character, doesn't help this problem.  He became annoying so many movies ago.  He peaked in ALADDIN, but now his non-stop patter seems to suck energy from a film rather than add it.  He's long been outclassed by Eddie Murphy's \\"Donkey\\" from SHREK.   <br /> <br />Please don't get me wrong...I'm nitpicking.  I'm giving the movie 4 stars only in comparison to its superior compatriots.  But it's still an enjoyable marvel, and I DO recommend it highly.  It wasn't perfect, but it's darn good. <br />
B0007GAEGC|5.0|This is the best thing to come out in a long time. I've got the CD having seen it on PBS and also saw the girls on the Today show on St. Patrick's Day. Just ordered the DVD which I can;t wait for!!! I don't understand how anyone can think this is middle of the road music or singing, it's really sophisticated and I keep hearing new things every time I play it, either in the vocals or in all the stuff going on behind, and judging by the CD credits there was az cast of thousands. So much more intricate than Enya's versions of her own songs, for instance. (probably get shot for saying that but it's true!) <br /> <br />I started by listening mainly to the tracks I knew like Danny Boy (yea I know not that one again, but it's really different and honest) and Nella Fantasia, but now I'm really getting into the stuff that;s unknown, it's cool to have both the big hits and loads of other music to get to know. I also LOVE the fiddle player Maread and her totally amazing track called \\"The Butterfly\\"!! <br /> <br />Best thing in years!
B00000J7J4|2.0|Santana motivated me to start playing guitar over 10 years ago when I saw him in concert. I bought handfulls of his releases around that time. He deserved his first grammys back in the 'black magic woman' days, but I doubt back then such music by a non-anglo would be allowed to champion the awards scene. I figure that's the only way you can explain it. How else do you explain how 'smooth' was such a hot hit? I cringed every time I came across that stupid song in my day to day life. Lots of canned music on this release and will not buy anymore Santana that are collaberations.    I'll cut Santana slack if this is a case of needing to pay the bills, but other than that, Carlos, please leave the cheesy pop music for the Britanys, Matchboxes, and Backstreets of the world.    Get back to Milagro, Dancing in the Flesh of Spirits, and Blues for ElSalvador. PLEASE!!

1573226521|5.0|I am a 29 year old Gen X man who is always looking for adventure and trying new things. I was very surprised that The Beach interested me on many levels. I found the story read very easily and touched on many aspects of life such as wanting to find that perfect place where beuty and the people are so freindly but no matter where you go greed and human nature are unavoidable. <br />I found alot of humor in the story and the characters were  made so well you felt as if you knew them.  I also watched the movie recently and found that it is not half as good as the book and didnt even come close to telling the story as well as it should have been. <br />I found it interesting that at the point in the book where he says he was sitting in a thicket of brush smoking a cigarette and commented on how that was the last time he remembers being himself. I may be wrong but it seems to me that you can see the gradual decline of morals and sanity in Richard, at the begining of the story he apears to be any man, as the story progresses you can see him change, very well written book!

B0007DAZW8|3.0|When I heard that Daft Punk had a new album coming out, I was excited. Their previous work has been consistently excellent, but considering that that only amounts to two proper albums, it may have been premature to assume that the third would be equally amazing. This new album isn't bad; it makes for pretty good background or dance music. But while Homework and Discovery were packed with really original and memorable music, Human After All ultimately comes off as repetitive and uninspired. Every track is comprised mostly of a few synth and vocoder lines repeating for 5 minutes with almost no variation. My favorite song on the album is the soothing Make Love, where the simple repetition formula works a little better with the ambient piano and muted guitar line, but even that one could have used a little more variation. All the underlying elements of each song are good; it just gets a little boring hearing the same 5 seconds of music repeated for 5 minutes. Not a bad album, but long-time Daft Punk fans will be disappointed.

B00005JMCW|5.0|I have quite a story with the very first time I had watched this movie. It was the first night of school in my senior year of high school. I said to myself, \\"Hmm...I would like to go see a movie tonite!\\" I looked at what was playing and nothing really caught my eye. So, I said to myself, \\"Oh, I guess I will just go see 'Freaky Friday'!\\" I had no clue whatsoever about what the movie was about. I didn't really have too high of expectations for this movie. I went in and took my seat. After the movie was over, I found myself saying \\"WOW! That was a good movie!\\" The music was great and well suited for the movie and the acting was superb. I decided to return to the movies again the next night. <br /> <br />The next night, I had an even greater reaction to this movie. From that moment on, I knew that this movie was going to become one of my all-time favorite movies. I returned to the movies one last time a week later to enjoy this film for the third time on my 18th birthday. I honestly can't think of any better way I would have liked to spend my 18th birthday rather than in that theater watching \\"Freaky Friday\\". <br /> <br />To all of you who don't own this movie and have seen it, (with a quote from one of Lindsay's songs in \\"Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen\\"), \\"What are you waiting for?\\" And, to everyone who hasn't seen this movie, \\"WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?\\" I give a 100% gurantee on this movie that you shall never be disappointed with this fantastic movie!
B00005U11Z|5.0|For years, JOURNEY has enjoyed success due, in part, to one Steve Perry. The albums before his arrival were excellent for their musicianship but it was when the band became more AOR than Jam band when Perry came aboard. I cant think of a time during the early to mid 1980s that Journey did not have at least ONE song on the charts. ANd when I was a teenager (late 1980s), it was Journey (and maybe a song or two by Def Leppard and Van Halen) that wwas part of the soundtrack to many make-out sessions I had had. Journey was great, except for ONE PROBLEM: Steve Perry is an [...]. Here is a man who, without Journey, is no one. Yes, without Steve Journey would be another escoteric rock band... rock's Weather Report. But, ever hear Steve Perry on his own? Yeah, he sucks. Both needed each other, and Steve's attitude and arrogance is legendary (watch BEHIND THE MUSIC). Hell, even Bad English was a nice change from Steve Perry-fronted Journey (Bad English consisted of Neal Schon, Jon Cain, and Deen Castonovo, who are now in Journey). Seemingly, the band and Perry could not find a happy medium of existance. However, instead of \\"doing the right thing\\" (as Journey always had done in the past) [...]  According to Journey's website, Neal Schon had a tape/LP/CD (whichever) of the little-known band TALL STORIES, with excellent tenor vocalist Steve Augeri. Augeri's band had split and he was working at a clothing store when Schon invited him for an audition. Seems to have worked out: Journey is now fronted by the curly haired tenor who sounds \\"like Steve Perry if Perry had balls.\\" Yes, Augeri and Perry sound incredibly alike, but without Perry's annoying \\"woos factor\\" and, this video will show, Augeri seems to work within Journey as a member of the band, not as if Journey were his backing band as did his predicesor (sp). You hear this in the ballads especially: \\"Faithfully\\" and \\"All the Way\\" have ALL the women in the front row swooning. Augeri can out-rock Perry also; just check out \\"AnyWay You Want It\\" or \\"Wheel in the Sky\\". This DVD is what Journey fans have been waiting for...an exciting concert where Journey is working AS A BAND and where all members, especially the singer, share the spotlight with each other. This way, the audience is the winner.
0894803123|5.0|I really like this recipe book.  The recipes are all very easy to put together using ordinary kitchen ingredients - nothing fancy although the ice cream tastes very much so!  The book also tells the history of the Ben and Jerry's franchise which is funny and interesting, and little tidbits of information about each flavor. <br /> <br />The recipes are perfect for use with the Cuisinart 1.5 quart ice cream maker.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|What was this movie about?  This has to be the worst movie I've seen in my entire life.  I'd rather watch a Shaq movie marathon than ever watch this again.   <br />Also, see K. Johnson's review.  I totally agree with that, but I don't want to plagerize. >:-P
038572179X|4.0|I loved the ending of this book, it made the read completely worthwhile and gave me something to think about for days afterward.  I also enjoyed the dramatic changes in setting - from a calm summer night in the British countryside to a violent war zone and back again.   <br /> <br />Briony's search for redemption and forgiveness for the crimes of her childhood is the main theme of the book as it explores the relationships of the betrayer and the betrayed and the near impossibility of forgiveness and atonement for an action yielding disastrous results.  The characters are real and compelling - you can feel and relate to their inner conflicts as well as outer circumstances.  The beginning is a little slow but is worth it in order to reach the surprising yet satisfying end.
B0007P3582|1.0|Listen people, don't buy this album. This album is garbage. This album is less than nothing. The maximum amount of starts I would give it would be -5. But the lowest is a 1 of course. Fifty is garbage and this album should have never been released. The dumbest thing he could do is kick the Game out of G-Unit. Please people, DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT  BUY THIS ALBUM!!! Save your money and go buy Untold Story or The Documentary from the Game. Once again, THIS ALBUM IS GARBAGE, YOU SUCK FIFTY!!!!!!!!!!!
B0007CNXUK|4.0|This artistic and very European style tasted film will beat you. The script is very simple but revealing. A writer will be involved with the beloved sons of an attractive widow- Mrs. Winslet- in a fascinating fantasy journey superbly linked with the drama. These imagination's exercises will permeate the most intimate places of our heart in search of our ancestral childhood's memories.<br /><br />In this state of things many ancient structures will fall down. As you know the creation process demands the destruction of the previous order politically correct. Depp makes a colossal performance throughout the picture and despite the film is extremely conventional angles shot, the artistic direction compensates certain weakness in the plot. This writer will feed the imagination of these boys and in the meantime will allow them to grow up when they face their mother's illness while Depp's  own marriage is sinking unavoidably.<br /><br />There is only a serious default all along the film and it's Winslet's performance. I think she didn't get absolutely the real commitment with this character and sometimes she looks like out of the role. I think in Helena Bonham Carter, Julianne Moore, Naomi Watts or Emma Thompsom for instance, to play with much more accuracy and brightness this exigent role and the film to my mind would have resulted totally satisfactory.
B00006NSGX|5.0|Clapton's singing and playing are better than ever, and every tune I was already familiar with, with the exception of \\"Badge\\", is given a captivating new twist, without drastically altering it. I particularly love how Clapton manages to wring more melody out of \\"Bell Bottom Blues\\" and more soul out of \\"Layla\\". The unfamiliar tunes are a treat, particularly \\"My Father's Eyes\\". This is infinitely better than the MTV \\"Unplugged\\" record.    A word of warning, however, to those suffering from acute tunnel vision: Clapton's musical imagination and maturity have broadened and deepened over the years, and there are more than a few traces of jazz here. If you absolutely hate jazz, don't buy this, and please don't bother to review it. Thank you.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Michael Mann's direction is solid and intriguing in this unusual crime thriller.  His 80s' MTV style resonates even in this new millenium, and he manages to combine his trademark action elements with satisfying performances from his two leads.  First of all, though, I have to comment on Jamie Foxx's performance.  In his Oscar winning portrayal of Ray Charles, Foxx WAS Ray Charles, and one had a hard time believing he was acting.  In COLLATERAL, he is obviously acting; his nuances and mannerisms are trademark acting---good and solid, but his nomination for supporting actor leaves me wondering if this performance deserved that accolade, particularly in light of his shooin for Best Actor.  Certainly there were other actors out there (Liev Schrieber in Manchurian Candidate; Alfred Molina in Spiderman 2, for example) who should have had Foxx's spot in the supporting category.  Anyway, while Jamie does well in this role, I found myself more mesmerized with Tom Cruise.  As a legitimate superstar, Cruise has not taken the comfortable route by doing roles that appeal to his audience or do not challenge him.  In COLLATERAL, he takes the risk of being an extremely cold, unlikeable killer, with no redeeming qualities.  His hair sleek and silver, behind those Raybans, Cruise oozes menace and is one of his most interesting performances.  His physical dexterity, his cold steely glare intensify his performance, and it's to his credit that he shares so much of the movie with Foxx.  COLLATERAL ultimately is a twisted \\"buddy movie,\\" although the bonding is definitely not one of choice but of necessity.  I had a hard time believing a cabbie could change so quickly and outsmart a suave professional hit man, but cinematic rules dictated this heroic twist.  Jada Pinkett Smith is cool in a small but pivotal role; Mark Ruffalo, Peter Berg and Bruce McGill offer solid support in standard roles; and catch the cameos of Javier Bardem as Felix and Jason Stratharn as the man Cruise bumps into in the opening scene.<br /><br />COLLATERAL works on many levels and I enjoyed it, although its rather despondent ending only reinforces Cruise's assertation that death is so common in LA that one might not even notice someone is dead.the opening scene.   <br />COLLATERAL works on many levels and I enjoyed it, although its rather despondent ending only reinforces Cruise's assertation that death is so common in LA that one might not even notice someone is dead.
B00003CX5P|5.0|I, like many people, think that this movie has unfairly gotten a very bad reputation.  I believe that because Episode II was admittedly not that great, that it has overshadowed Episode I as well.  I personally think that while Jake Lloyd was only the first bad actor to play Anakin, the rest of the acting in the movie was very good.  Natalie Portman, as a queen, was not supposed to sound \\"human.\\"  She was supposed to sound stiff!  But I think the best acting comes from Palpatine, and from the two Jedi Knights, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi.  I was very sad when Qui-Gon died, and felt that he could've proved a valuable character in the subsequent movies.  Darth Maul, I felt, also died too soon.  He showed himself to be a much better Dark Jedi than stupid Dooku, and could've been a good final opponent for Anakin before becoming Palpatine's apprentice.  But I'm also a believer in George Lucas.  I think that any decisions he made, he made them with the other movies in mind.  But I wish I could travel back in time and tell him not to direct it.  And to kill Jar-Jar.  But I think I'm just dreaming.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|When I went to see this film I was expecting, based on the preview, some crazy caper movie, like Bill Murray's previous duck-out-of-water movie \\"The Man Who Knew Too Little.\\" I love that kind of film so I was quite looking forward to a little simple-minded fun. What I got instead was far from what I expected, but considerably more than I could have hoped for.<br /><br />What I got was a film that truly moved me - for reasons inexplicable to me at the time. What I got was a beautiful visual experience, that left me feeling as if I was actually in the film (a feeling I've never had before with a film). What I got was a story about two characters that I felt I could really relate to and understand on a much closer level than I have seen in other films. What I got was a sense of having seen something truly magical, and when I left the cinema, I felt that I had to see it again. And I did.<br /><br />I've always liked Bill Murray in almost any role he has been in, but he outshone himself this time. Not since \\"The Razor's Edge\\" have I seen him display so well that he is not just a comedian but an ACTOR of quite considerable talent. There was one scene at the end of the film that particularly demonstrated this. The look on his character's face as he watched his friend Charlotte walking away conveyed so much emotional meaning that I could have sworn I was feeling it too. That part of the film alone was worth seeing and it was only one brilliant scene among many.<br /><br />A lot of reviewers have complained that the film lacked a plot and was \\"boring.\\" I think they missed the point. The plot was in the emotions and the experiences. This was a film about two people lost in a strange place and lost in their own lives. It was a film about developing a special bond with another person that was far more important than any romance could produce. The plot was in the characters. There are no disasters to avert, treasures to find, bombs to defuse or crooks to catch. It was a story that could happen to anyone. Maybe that's one of the reasons why it is so easy to connect with.<br /><br />I would remind people that there are plenty of stories  out there that are classics in which the plot is not so obvious. Hemingway's \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is the perfect example of a story in which there is virtually no overt plot, yet a considerable amount of action is occurring at levels other than those of action. The same could be said for \\"Lost In Translation.\\"<br /><br />Yes, sad to say there are no epic gun battles, sword fights, vampires, computer generated effects or fart jokes in this film. There are no cute little Hobbits to root for. Too bad. If you want fart jokes, catch something by Adam Sandler and such. If you want sword fights and Hobbits, watch the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and other such dreck. \\"Lost In Translation\\" is not a film for everyone. But if you are interested in films where the characters are more important than the effects (e.g., \\"Sideways\\") then \\"Lost In Translation\\" will be perfect for you.<br /><br />And one last point. I agree fully with Clint Eastwood when he said that the Oscars were \\"Hobbitised\\" that year. I cannot understand how films such as \\"Lost In Translation\\" or \\"Mystic River\\" could be beaten by an overblown and ultimately empty effects display like \\"Return of the King.\\"story that could happen to anyone.

B000002H70|4.0|This was probably the third Cure album I purchased after becoming hooked on their unique sound. Although it is regarded by many to be a classic (and I for one will defend that claim), it is flawed like every other masterpiece crafted before it. For me, the standout track is \\"Pictures of You\\", hands down. It's powerful, it raises goosebumps, and it utterly convinces you that this is as good as music will ever get til the end of time. However I'm not so crazy about \\"Love Song\\", despite the fact that it was one of their biggest hit singles. To be honest, and I know a lot of fans are going to lynch me for this, but I think that the keyboarding on \\"Love Song\\" is ultra-cheesy and downright painful to listen to (and this is strange because the keyboarding has always been great on their previous and future efforts, let alone the rest of this album). What is their darkest song? Most likely \\"Same Deep Water As You\\". If this song doesn't invoke heart-sickness in you, then you're already emotionally empty to begin with. Like I said, it's a Grade A album, and deserves to be bought, but it's not their best release. I reserve 100 percent praise for \\"Bloodflowers\\", the last installment in their famously touted gloom trilogy.      P.S. You say one little thing about Love Song and the unhelpful votes start piling up for some mystifying reason. *roll eyes*
B0000VD04M|5.0|\\"Ed Wood\\" is such a gloriously brilliant film. It's the perfect meshing of the unique talents of director Tim Burton and an almost surreal Hollywood story that probably needed to be told. Fact is indeed stranger than fiction, and \\"Ed Wood\\" embraces this lovable (and seedy) story of the underbelly of 1950s filmmaking. <br /> <br />Most of what you see in \\"Ed Wood\\" is true, and if Burton bends the tale for his own sensibilities, well, I doubt Mr. Wood is turning in his grave. Edward D. Wood, Jr. has long been considered the worst filmmaker in history. His resume is stocked with horror/sci-fi films from the late 50s so inept they cause unstoppable laughing fits. Churning out \\"Glen or Glenda,\\" \\"Bride of the Monster\\" and \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space,\\" Ed Wood created Drive-In turkeys replete with staggeringly horrid dialog, cardboard sets and atrocious acting. These outrageous films are applauded today by bad-movie connoisseurs. <br /> <br />Burton, whose love of old horror films is well documented, was the perfect man to make this movie. The casting choices, most notably Johnny Depp as Mr. Wood, Martin Landau as a decrepit Bela Lugosi and Bill Murray as John Breckinridge, are inspired. There's some bittersweet elements in \\"Ed Wood,\\" as our obsessively positive protagonist recruits one Hollywood castoff after another, forming the most unlikely repertory company in history. A drug-addicted Lugosi, wrestler Tor Johnson, a recently fired Vampira and other misfits attempt to create films from shoestring budgets, bonding due to their own failures in life. <br /> <br />Burton, filming in black and white with a great eye for detail, has produced a heartfelt anthem to not only the wonder of filmmaking, but to lost souls wishing to create but lacking the gift to do so. This odd troupe may be a gang of talentless hacks, but for a brief moment their club breeds kinship.  <br /> <br />\\"Ed Wood\\" is a tribute to sad failures within an unforgiving industry. As we see Landau's Lugosi standing in filthy water preparing to battle a rubber octopus, we realize how tragic his life has become. This one-time superstar has reached a surreal low, sinking into a Gothic Norma Desmond mire. It's a haunting snapshot, as profound as a Shakespeare tragedy. The souls of \\"Ed Wood\\" died struggling with dark addictions, as forgotten as paupers. Burton has given them their fairy tale of glory.
B000089CJI|4.0|I bought Give Up because the rave from the biz and it's supposedly a mix of Daft Punk and Death Cab for Cutie.  What I got was something unlike anything I have heard in recent years.  Though similar to other artists a lot of the appeal on this album is its new sound with its deep lyrics.    You see the lyrics are some of the best I have heard, and thats just it, I don't know if I can call them deep lyrics, because having such a gift, Gibbard can bring such depth to a song that you feel special enough to understand.  With rhymes that are mindblowing, and verses that flow you can just sit there and not have to think about what he is singing you can just absorb it into your soul.    The beats, the sounds, the other half of the Postal Service Tamborello delivers amazing tracks that are s wonderful as Gibbard's lyrics.  Both talented, the outcome of putting their minds together is one in which we should all rejoice for since we are lucky enough to reap the rewards and listen to it.    The only complaint with the Postal Service is one common throughout tronica albums, repetitive.  The beats have a certain Wow factor that once you know whats coming it is not as great the second time around.  Not to say that about the album though since I have listened and loved it a second, third.. and many more times to come.  If they can improve with the small faults found on this album a successor will be heaven.    This is an album to be loved by all since their is something hear for everyone's taste.  The Postal Service's Give Up receives  A Bliss of 8
B0000009RX|5.0|I used to think that the albums around Overnite Sensation, Apostrophe and One Size Fits All, where the best because they are excellent combinations of text, music and great guitar playing. But through the years I have come to appreciate the excellent compositions of We're Only in It for the Money. The texts are great too but really not neccesary... Just listen to those melodies. In my humble opinion the best of the first handful of albums until he seriously pick up the guitar on Hot Rats.
B0002858YS|2.0|I guess I am getting old. The Smiths,NewOrder,Cure and Talking heads were my music. These bands all sound like watered down versions. Check out the older guys, It was such a great time in music, and dont forget the Clash.
B000002AP1|5.0|I'm going to keep this short and straight to the point if you don't mind:<br /><br />You wanna know what real rock 'n' roll is? The Stooges \\"Raw Power\\" is real rock 'n' roll, hard aggresive, fast, sloppy, brilliant. Pure and simple. This is what rock 'n' roll should sound like.<br /><br />Thank you.
B000002HPV|5.0|Suffice to say, I have heard Bjork's works from \\"Post\\" to the new \\"Medulla\\" and every one of her albums have moments of brilliance. But if you were to buy just one Bjork album, this should be it. If you want another one, buy Vespertine!  <br /> <br />Almost every song on this album has its own creative brilliance. Absolute jems: Hunter (amazing hooks), Joga (the most melodious), Bachelorette (epic like), alarm call (cool dance track) and finally the album closes with its best track - All is full of love. This is an album every music enthusiast should have - after all, it is the best Bjork album!

Everyone of his albums and everything he does is sick.  Demented and out of touch with reality. <br />Almost worse than Cannibal Corpse.
B000001EUN|5.0|Released in 1980, this is the first album to totally feature Matthias Jabs as the 2nd guitarist. This is a true classic heavymetal album!  From the Hipgnosis cover of a woman kneeling in front of a man (who has a beer in one hand and his other hand in his back jeans pocket) you can pretty much guess that this is going to be an album about women kneeling in front of men, but it really is an album of songs in which the guy is made to kneel and grovel for the woman! Ahh, the Scorpions!  Here are my ratings of the songs based out of 5 *****:<br /><br />Make It Real - A guitar rif opening which gives way to a chugging tempo.  Some fine bass work from Francis  and great guitar exchanges from Mathias and Rudolf. Tempo could almost be considered ballad style and Journey could do no better.  A great postive tune about striving for your dreams!  Lets hope its still in the live set.  Rating - *****<br /><br />  Don't Make No Promises (Your Body Can't Keep) - Starts out fast and furious and changes tempo when the lyrics start to a surging beat.  A song about lust.  Some terrific bass playing from Francis and as always  great guitar solos.  A terrific song.  A classic metal tune.  Rating - *****<br /><br />  Hold Me Tight - A slow, churning guitar, drums, then bass opening.  Klaus sings great on this one!  I love his voice.  Instantly recognizable. A bluesy feel to this song.  Rating - ****<br /><br />  Twentieth Century Man -  A mid-tempo song  with great lyrics by Klaus. I really like this song.  Not your typical 'I want sex, give it to me now' song.  \\"The world's devoted to the Dollar-sign.\\" Not much has changed since then Klaus.  rating - ****<br /><br />  Lady Starlight -  The ballad of the album.  Klaus sure can sing these.  What emotion and conviction he sings with!  Who better to sing a ballad than Klaus?  A song of longing and love with a fine string section accompianing Klaus. A terrific guitar solo from Rudolf - Rating - ****<br /><br />  Falling In Love - This song recevied substantial air play during the early '80s.  A simple guitar intro gives way to a drum and bass pounding tempo.  Some great guitar work on display.  Klaus hits some of his highest notes on this song. A fantastic metal song, a true classic!  Nearly perfect. Herman Rarebell wrote some of the greatest songs in the Scorpions catalogue, this is one of them!  Rating - *****<br /><br />  Only A Man - A Queen like opening of only Klaus singing without accompianment leads into one of the finest hardock songs done by the Scorpions.  A surging guitar and bass tempo with Klaus singing \\"Now you now how I feel.  Nothing is real.\\"  As usual, you get great guitar solos.  Classic song - Rating- *****<br /><br />  The Zoo - This song also received alot of airplay during its time. A great guitar intro followed by drums which turn into a real slow, surging elephant pounding tempo. Heavy bass from Francis. A bluesy type song.  More explosive guitar solos from the menacing axe duo of Rudolf and Mathias.  The Peter Frampton \\"voice air-guitar\\" that was real popular in the 70's is also heard on this song. A great hard rock song about sex -  rating - *****<br /><br />  Animal Magnetism -  A hypnotic guitar and drum opening - sort of like \\"Kashmire\\" by Led Zep.  Great singing by Klaus and guitar playing by the solo twins turns another inane song about sex into a fantastic hard rock tune.  Only the Scorpions could have a whole album devoted to sex and make it a classic!  Rating - ****<br /><br />The cover of the album insinuates sex and that is what this album delivers.  A strong heavy metal album with sexual overtones and in your face ball wagging by the greatest sexmetal band ever! Overall,a classic metal album that should definitely be part of your collection!80s.  A simple guitar intro gives way to a drum and bass pounding tempo.  Some great guitar work on display.  Klaus hits some of his highest notes on this song. A fantastic metal song, a true classic!  Nearly perfect. Herman Rarebell wrote some of the greatest songs in the Scorpions catalogue, this is one of them!   Rating - *****      Only A Man - A Queen like opening of only Klaus singing without accompianment leads into one of the finest hardock songs done by the Scorpions.  A surging guitar and bass tempo with Klaus singing \\"Now you now how I feel.  Nothing is real.\\"  As usual, you get great guitar solos.  Classic song - Rating- *****      The Zoo - This song also received alot of airplay during its time. A great guitar intro followed by drums which turn into a real slow, surging elephant pounding tempo. Heavy bass from Francis. A bluesy type song.  More explosive guitar solos from the menacing axe duo of Rudolf and Mathias.  The Peter Frampton \\"voice air-guitar\\" that was real popular in the 70's is also heard on this song. A great hard rock song about sex -  rating - *****      Animal Magnetism -  A hypnotic guitar and drum opening - sort of like \\"Kashmire\\" by Led Zep.  Great singing by Klaus and guitar playing by the solo twins turns another inane song about sex into a fantastic hard rock tune.  Only the Scorpions could have a whole album devoted to sex and make it a classic!  Rating - ****    The cover of the album insinuates sex and that is what this album delivers.  A strong heavy metal album with sexual overtones and in your face ball wagging by the greatest sexmetal band ever! Overall,a classic metal album that should definitely be part of your collection!
B000000H6D|5.0|*Note*- I have the original full version of this album, not the minimized digipak, which features radio edits of two of the biggest songs on this album, and many cut tracks... Find the original version of this album at all costs! It's far better! <br /> <br />\\"Bloody Kisses\\" is an album that will either go down in your book as one of your favorite personal albums, or as an overblown circus of tongue-in-cheek goth metal. I personally cannot stop listening to this album with its romantic, dark, and sombre atmosphere, yet have a sound that is so crushing while maintaining a sense of unseen and crude humor, which is clearly displayed in the lyrics of the songs. Peter Steele has crafted a masterpiece of gloom and doom, yet somehow still seems to sit back laughing at his own tragedy and heartbreak. To say the least, the lyrics of many songs on this album are NOT to be taken seriously. For instance, \\"Black No. 1\\" pokes fun at goth culture, and contains a lot of irony, since TON are considered \\"goth\\" metal. \\"We Hate Everyone\\" is a surprising return to Peter's days in barbaric thrashers Carnivore with some assaulting and crude lyrics, yet somehow comes off as truly hilarious.  <br /> <br />The moods here switch here a lot. Some songs are crushing, funeral-like dirges, such as the title track. Others are more up-beat and catchy with 60's like trippy keyboards, and a few are total thrashers. The choruses here for the most part are very catchy, and have a punk-like feel to them with simultaneous yelling. \\"Bloody Kisses\\" shows TON sticking to their guns the only way they know possible, but also has a lot of experimentation. There is a perfect blend of stoner rock, crushing goth metal, and some weird \\"hippy\\" rock, shall I say? It may seem ridiculous, but it adds to the overall feel of the album, and works out quite well. The guitars use a tasteful, fuzzy distortion seen on all TON releases, and adds a grungy, dirty, raunchy feel to every song. The bass uses a similar overdrive, which gives the songs an added feeling of warmth. The drums are simple, but fit well. There's a little bit of everything to be seen here. <br /> <br />But I couldn't go without mentioning Steele's booming vocals. He's like a more ominus, manic depressive version of Barry White... And a lot more pale as well, lol. Some screams are strung throughout, and he does some catchy punk-like chanting every now and then. His oddball lyrics (\\"Kill All the White People\\"?) may raise a few eyebrows, but it's clear to see that despite his hidden misanthropy and gloom, he comes off as somewhat of a jokester. But he could just as easily write serious and sexual lyrics, such as on \\"Can't Lose You\\" and the mournful dirge of the title track. <br /> <br />1. Machine Screw- Hehe.... I'm not even going to go into this... Let's just say it sets the mood with some rather... interesting (?!) sound effects.  <br /> <br />2. Christian Woman- One of my favorite TON tracks ever. Starts out with a calm, atmospheric intro with haunting keys, and builds into a slow passage with great backing vocals and a dreamy atmosphere, contained through the rest of the song. Features some good acoustic guitars and builds into my favorite part.... \\"Jesus Christ looks like me...\\" Ah, I love that. The lyrics are dark but laughable, giving the whole song an ironic feeling for its cathedral-like atmosphere. A stunning song. 5/5 <br /> <br />3. Black No. 1 (Little Miss Scare-All)- One of TON's best songs. Features a catchy main line and chorus, and some pretty funny yet darkly romantic lyrics as well. Clocks in at 11 minutes, and has an indescribable atmosphere. 5/5 <br /> <br />4. Fay Wray Come Out and Play- This is the beginning of the interludes on the album. Has some strange, vodoo-like chanting with ominus tribal drums booming in the background while a woman screams... Kind of gives me some mental imagery I'd rather not dwell on.... Haha.  <br /> <br />5. Kill All the White People- A catchy thrasher with a dirty stoner feel and Peter's bravado screams fronting the Celtic Frost-like assault of fast to slow-paced guitar lines before kicking into a slow breakdown with sounds of war in the background. Very catchy song, and one of the heaviest here. 5/5 <br /> <br />6. Summer Breeze- This is one of the most famous songs on the album. It was originally a rather up-beat, happy feel, but TON slowed it WAY down and gave it a sexual, raunchy feel. Very catchy and trippy, a superb song. 5/5 <br /> <br />7. Set Me on Fire- Meh... Didn't do much for me... Just a proto-type 60's song with cheesy organs and Josh doing his back-up vocals of the same line over and over.... Next! 2/5 <br /> <br />8. Dark Side of the Womb- Another interlude with babies crying sampled over an industrial beat. Nothing to see here. <br /> <br />9. We Hate Everyone- YES! A truly addictive uber-thrasher with a fist-pumping feel and punky chorus. Great lyrics, which openly ridicules any critics of TON. Definitely one of my favorites on the album. 5/5 <br /> <br />10. Bloody Kisses (A Death in the Family)- Wow... A funeral-like dirge of true goth metal with a drag-horse tempo and suicidal atmosphere. Another one of my favorites... If you were happy before hearing this album, you won't be after hearing this song. 5/5 <br /> <br />11. 3.O.I.F.- Another skit, and quite a disturbing one at that... <br /> <br />12. Too Late (Frozen)- Another catchy, mid-paced track with great back-up vocals and a \\"boppy\\" atmosphere. Very nice, a change from the rest of the album. Not too memorable, but still good. 4/5 <br /> <br />13. Blood & Fire- A more typical TON song with a provocative, sexual, and raunchy feel, (just look at the lyrics) seems to sum up the album best. Though, for some reason, I can't help but to see an AC/DC influence in this song... But the vocals are really good, and that does more than compensate for this oddball of a song. 4/5 <br /> <br />14. Can't Lose You- A very romantic, sombre, and dark closer. Much like the title track, and closes the album very well with a trippy and sexy atmosphere. 3/5 <br /> <br />A soundtrack to sexual activities? An epilogue of bitter heartbreak? Or just an all-out misunderstood album?? Ah, who knows... This is definitely TON's best album, and I would track down the original version at all costs. Highly reccommended to fans of goth rock and doom metal. Highly reccommended!
B00005JLYW|5.0|McG directs like a music video director. He uses tons of slowmotion and all sorts of unnecessarily swishy camera moves. He only bothers with enough plot to move the Angels from one location to the next. And almost every second of the movie contains some kind of background music, usually at full volume. <br /> <br />I should add that most of the humor in the film (with the exception of one scene) elicits smiles rather than laughs. Nobody in the film acts very well. The plot is more like a sketch on draft paper than an actual blueprint. <br /> <br />And yet this would be the most purely enjoyable film I've seen in the last two years.  <br /> <br />CT: FT never takes itself seriously. It *knows* it's a dumb movie. It *knows* its audience has come to see a dumb movie. So McG doesn't have any hesitation in showing us stuff like the Angels driving a truck over a dam wall and flying a helicopter (!) to safety. Or a motorcross race that includes one guy flipping himself upside-down above his handlebars and firing two pistols at our heroes. Or a main character (Demi Moore's, in fact) literally flying. <br /> <br />Music video directors are supposed to come from the armpit of Satan or something, but McG's bacground doesn't seem to have hurt his style much. He times things perfectly, always knowing when to cut to give maximum impact to the fight scenes. (You may find yourself wincing in sympathy for some of the bad guys). He keeps it all moving, switching from scene to scene at just the right time and somehow holding our interest despite the flimsy plot. And he somehow avoids cliche (unless the point of a scene is to knowingly invoke cliche) - this doesn't look like any other movie.   <br /> <br />So many of the criticisms of this movie are off base. \\"The plot is weak\\" - it doesn't matter. \\"Style over substance\\" - tell us something we can't see for ourselves. Think of it like this: CA: FT is an amusement park ride. There's nothing *wrong* with amusement park rides. We're all happy to shell out our money for them 'cause we get shot full of adrenaline and leave laughing at the end. Now movies *can* be so much more - a film like The Godfather or Apocalypse Now is a work of art that can deepen your understanding of the world - but did The Godfather make you want to stand on your seat and shout \\"HELL YEAH!\\"?  <br /> <br />Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle is a Hell Yeah movie. And if you didn't like it, watch out, because there's a lot more movies like it coming.
B00002Z88D|1.0|What's next? Hire Desmond Child as a co-songwriter so you can be kings of pop-metal? Hire Luciano Pavarotti and perform the first metal opera? Hire Yanni (pronounced yawn-e)and do the first pop metal kids song? Instead of doing the complete versions of their older songs live, do medleys so they can spend more time playing the new crap? (Oops, sorry bout that last one, they already do that!) <br /> <br />Cliff Burton spins in his grave &  the fans of Ride the Lightning shed yet another tear. This is basically the last gasp of a dying band. They did the box of live stuff (overkill), they've released 1 and a half albums of lackluster sub-alternative metal (Reload is the half, in case anyone cares), rereleased their b-sides from the hayday and added lackluster new cover versions (BOB SEGER? the Metallica of 1984 would kick the asses of 1998 for even thinking it!!!!!) and this godawful monstrosity. A \\"heavy metal\\" band with a symphony orchestra. Woo-hoo. Sorry I don't leap out of my chair with excitement, I'm too busy trying to figure out what castrated this once great band. Heartless performances abound.  I can see them spicing up their newer post Justice stuff with an orchestra (hell try anything to bring life into that vat of poop!!) but to desecrate classics?!?!? Blasphemy!!!! Here's the scoop: if you like METALLICA ('81-'90) you will cry. If you like Alternica ('91-'02) you're gonna dig the s**t outta this.
0783114222|3.0|The storytelling is excellent. The subject matter is fascinating and inspirational. Truly incredible filmmaking. Unfortunately, the DVD transfer is just terrible! The image quality is shockingly bad with distracting levels of pixelization. As much as they spent producing this series, you'd think they could make the stunning visuals transfer to DVD without these kinds of artifacts. They dropped the ball on the last step on this one.
B000002WUD|5.0|Unlike Elvis' 1950s output, which could all be fit neatly into the KING OF ROCK & ROLL box set, his seventies catalogue is vast and, admittedly, not always spectacular. WALK A MILE IN MY SHOES is therefore a selective and subjective look at the King's last seven years; and while no such compilation can ever be perfect in the eyes of anyone but those lucky enough to have been assigned the task of assembling it, this is a wonderfully packaged and remastered body of (mostly) wonderful work.<br /><br />  Elvis' downward spiral - physical and artistic - over the course of his final years has been overplayed to such an extent that many people, unfamiliar with the King's latterday output, assume that little if any of it could be worthwhile. This is a huge mistake, as WALK A MILE IN MY SHOES admirably proves. To be sure, the early seventies represented a far higher peak for Elvis in all respects than the mid-seventies (or, for that matter, most of the sixties); so it's no surprise that 1970 is the most referenced year in this box set - both on the discs themselves and in the photos adorning the excellent accompanying book. Nevertheless, Elvis continued to make good music right up until the end, and the producers of this collection have made sure to remind us of that by their choice and assemblage of material.<br /><br />  Discs one and two contain all of Elvis' 1970s singles (A and B sides), with the inexplicable and rather outrageous exceptions of two \\"gospel\\" numbers which, we are happily informed, can be found on another compilation. But why leave them off, if completeness is the point here? In any case, classics such as \\"Burnin' Love\\" and \\"Always on My Mind\\" sound greater than ever alongside equally fine but less celebrated performances such as \\"I'm Leavin',\\" \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\" and \\"Fool,\\" and the good stuff just keeps on coming. For some reason, a few of the songs aren't presented in strict release order, which is something of a mystery as they don'tfollow a chronological order either; but in any case, these are two truly excellent CDs, top to bottom and end to end.<br /><br />  Discs three and four contain non-single studio recordings from 1970-71 and 1971-76, respectively, and while a few of the selections may be argued over there's no denying that most of these are indeed essential Elvis tracks. The 1970 Nashville sessions which yielded most of THAT'S THE WAY IT IS and ELVIS COUNTRY, as well as the LOVE LETTERS FROM ELVIS album and several singles, are offered in their entirety save for a half-dozen or so songs, which depending on your perspective might qualify as over- or under-representation; and there are some rehearsal tracks of debatable quality. Nevertheless, oddities like the original studio version of \\"My Way\\" and unedited versions of some of the Nashville songs are treats indeed.<br /><br />  Disc five is a compilation of live material recorded between 1970 and 1977, which is an appropriate way to cap off this box since the King's concerts were probably the most crucial component of his work in the seventies. The outstanding ON STAGE album is tapped for no fewer than six tracks, including \\"Walk a Mile in My Shoes\\" itself, easily one of Elvis' greatest performances and here nicely prefaced with the King reciting a bit of the poem \\"Men with Broken Hearts.\\" Songs from the 1972 Madison Square Garden concerts and 1973's \\"Aloha from Hawaii\\" are also included, of course, as well as top-notch versions of \\"Never Been to Spain,\\" \\"You Gave Me a Mountain\\" and \\"Unchained Melody.\\" Things bog down a bit in the middle of the disc, with a couple of the half-baked, half-length versions of his fifties hits which the King offered as a nostalgic wink to his greying audience making things more than a bit silly; but that, too, was part of the experience, and so it's probably rightly included here.<br /><br />  A truly definitive collection of Elvis' seventies material is clearly an impossibility. Everyone has his favorites, and the King's musical palette was far too broad in his last years to allow even a set this big to be completely comprehensive. WALK A MILE IN MY SHOES is as good an attempt to pare things down to six hours as we're ever likely to hear, though, and that's more than enough to make it a must. Long live the King!
B0007OASII|5.0|This album sounds like nothing the band has done before and that is not a bad thing because this disk is nothing short of a masterpiece. Black Halo is more than a worthy successor to Karma and Epica. The production is great and the band performs to the expected high levels. Roy Khan once again proves he is without doubt the best vocalist in metal today (The new Geoff Tate). <br /> <br />Even though it is still early in the year, it is very unlikely that a better album will be released in 2005. Do yourself a favor and order this today. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000001EYW|5.0|This album is beautiful. I am only 24 and I absolutely love \\"alone\\" and \\"obsessions\\" \\"closer than close\\". \\"obsessions\\" alone is worth buying the album. I love the Bee Gees so much. I especially love their lovey dovey ballads. woo hoo, this album is great! yum! great stuff!
B00000JLWW|5.0|Well what can I say that hasn't already been said? This is the greatest film of all time, EVER, and if you don't at least recognize that, you're some sort of mental case! My favorite part is when Jack dies at the end and Kate Winslet is really sad and she remembers how cute he was and she's really old. I also liked how the people were flying through the air at the end and it reminded me of Cirque Du Soleil (which stands for Circus of the Stars. A real winner! And I like it when the Critters eat the chili.
B000002P5W|5.0|I have to chime in and agree with Monsieur dePlume -- Jimi's solo at the end of Bold As Love is utterly sublime, worth the price of admission.  It's one of those minutes of music I come back to again and again, decade after decade, when I want a shot of inspiration, and I end up listening to it over and over again, cranking up the volume at the very end so I can hear those last few few notes as they fade out.  There is nothing like it.  And Little Wing hardly needs me to vouch for it; many's the guitarist who considers it the ultimate hip thing to casually pick up an axe and start in on Little Wing.  Clapton/Allman's (very different) version on Layla was killer, Sting's was heartfelt but derivative, and Stevie Ray's was as good as a cover gets, but there's nothing like the orginal for sheer, simple beauty, from the guy who could have embellished it beyond belief if he'd wanted to.
B000002UJQ|5.0|this is an amazing album, and it definitely deserves a 5 star rating.
0156027321|2.0|Looking for a strong tale of adventure, courage and fun? Then this is SO not the book for you. Although it actually starts out as an interesting concept: a young boy, Pi, is learning and exploring things about himself, his religious beliefs and so on. His father owns a zoo and they get aboard a ship to travel to America. The ship sinks and everyone on board, including Pi's family, drowns. Pi is stranded in a lifeboat with few supplies, a hyena, a zebra and a Bengal tiger. <br /> <br />At first his situation is exciting, bringing up the essential and inevitable questions, such as: how will he survive? what'll he do when the monstrous carnivores get hungry? should he shove them off the boat while they're sleeping so he can prevent any attacks? But as soon as these questions are answered, boredom sets in. Having grown up on a zoo, Pi uses his knowledge of the instinctive nature of the animals and quickly resolves to make the tiger afraid of him, for that is the only way he stands a chance of surviving. He rubs his scent all around the boat, as if marking the area as his own. This presents good thinking on Pi's part, but truthfully it isn't very believable. A pre-teen boy stranded in the middle of the Pacific on a tiny boat with a zebra (who is eaten by the hyena), a hyena (who eventually dies) and a tiger? And these animals never even threaten or injure him once? Doesn't sound too realistic. (Then again, it's fiction - it isn't supposed to seem real.) <br /> <br />After what seems like weeks of reading about Pi's daily and nightly rituals of getting food, praying, and so on, he finally reaches shore at some island consisting of cannibalistic plants. The ending is a bit confusing, at least it was for me. Detectives are trying to understand Pi's story, and they conclude that the portrayal of the hyena, zebra and tiger were all metaphors (or symbols) of himself and others in the shipwreck. So I was confused: Did those animals really exist at all? Or had they just been made up to accomodate Pi's tale after all? It all turned out unclear to me, and I don't think it was worth the read. Out of 400 pages, only about 250 held my interest. But who knows? -If you're interested in reading about the uneventful semi-struggle of a boy and his tiger, by all means, check it out.

B0002F7I9Y|5.0|Since the early 1950's, Ray Charles has always made history with his music; meanwhile, changing the lives of millions of listeners.  His music always gained rave reviews.  He released several hit singles that continually reach listeners today including \\"Georgia On My Mind\\", \\"Hit the Road Jack\\", \\"A Song For You\\", and many others.  Occassionally, he tried different music genres at a time when it was still taboo.  Regardless if he was singing R&B, gospel, country, rock & roll, or pop, the quality of his work never fell below the top.  His performances through his vocals and his piano remained soulful.  Before and throughout his career, he fought through many life struggles (blindness, racism, controversy, heroin addiction) to grow into the artist as what millions know him. <br /> <br />Then, in 2004, a lot happened in Ray Charles history.  He collaborated with twelve influencial musicians to record what would be his last album.  \\"Genius Loves Company\\", released a month after his death, beautifully closes his career and his life.  He later garnered five Grammys (Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Best Pop Album, Best Pop Collaboration, and Best Gospel Recording), and three others were rewarded to other album participants.  Though his illness was continually worsening throughout the recording, hense the frayed voice, he maintained his hardworkmanship.  Aside from the critically acclaimed film \\"Ray\\" based on his life and the Oscar winning performance from Jamie Foxx, this album is truly one of the best of 2004.   <br /> <br />The varity of music genres express on this album sum his career.  Yet, everything blends wonderfully.  This again proves his musical range.  Some are covers from the other artists, and some are songs he previously recorded years ago.  All live up to their originals.  Regardless of theme and partner's vocal texture, every duet contained the special chemistry.  Ray Charles changes his own vocal texture to blend with the partner's.  Despite, he never loses the spark that launched his career in the 1950's.  The music is rearranged to successfully fulfill this overall theme.  Duets include Elton John, Diana Krall, Bonnie Raitt, and Willie Nelson.  This album opens with the Grammy winning \\"Here We Go Again\\" recorded with Norah Jones.  This beautiful ballad, originally released by Charles in 1968, shares the overall intentions of this album.  It readies the remaining songs on the album.   <br /> <br />The passionate performances from everybody catch hearts of its listeners.  All prove that there'll be nobody like Ray Charles in a long time.  Therefore, his legend will continue to live.  Such musical quality makes \\"Genius Loves Company\\" an essential album, leaving \\"with a bang\\".  This album will never be forgotten by its listeners.
B0006A9FMI|3.0|I'm such a geek for anime.  From some really good ones like \\"Spirited Away\\" to tremendously sucky ones like \\"Ninja Resurrection\\" *shudder*, I just love animated action.  Maybe it's the colors, or the details the animators put into one of these movies (the good ones, mind you), that just...yeah, I like 'em a lot.<br /><br />I'll be honest though, and say that at first, I didn't think I would like \\"Innocence\\" that much, because I wasn't too crazy about \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" the first time I saw it.  I can't really think of the reason why, other than it just didn't stick with me.  Funny how I liked the sequel much better, though.  (I think the Stand Alone Complex tv series has something to do with this, though.)<br /><br />~SPOILER ALERT -- You have been warned...~<br /><br />Set 3 years after Major Motoko Kusanagi's \\"ghost\\" (personality) merged with the cyber net, \\"Innocence\\" focuses on Batou, the Major's former partner, as he investigates a series of murders committed by a particular model of gynoids, the Hadaly robotic sex dolls.  The dolls had turned on their owners before deliberately mal-functioning in a suicidal effort.  Teamed up with a new partner, Togusa, Batou delves deeper into the case, finding the links between a yakusa gang, missing girls (and I do mean girls) and Locus Solus, the manufacturer of the Hadaly.  Turns out the yakusa were supplying the girls to Locus Solus, who would then dub the girls' personalities -- ghosts -- onto the dolls to make them more desirable, because they seemed more human.  However, two questions arise:<br /><br />Did the girls want to be dolls?  More importantly, did the dolls want to be human?<br /><br />The second question is always a good one for discussion, because it makes one wonder at humanity's vanity to create things in its own image.  By infusing the Hadaly dolls with someone else's stolen personality, was perhaps Locus Solus robbing the dolls of their own?  Can robots/cyborgs/etc ever develop the capability to feel?  (This could go on for hours, I'm sure)<br /><br />Now, what I liked most about this movie was the visuals; vibrant and detailed, the visuals play a great part in telling the story.  The Japanese singing in the background was good, too, as was the guest appearance of the Major in a different form.<br /><br />What I didn't like most about \\"Innocence\\" was the over-abundant use of Confucius and other philosophical quotes.  These take up too much of the dialogue between Batou and Togusa.  Some more originality would have suited me just fine.  Still, \\"Ghost in the Shell 2\\" was good to watch.<br /><br />I might watch the first movie again; I might like it better the second time around.  :-)y to feel?

B00078XKDE|5.0|I have seen them play live at least ten times. I read about them in some local weekly three years ago. They sounded like a band I should check out. I even paid for my friend. It was at some industrial park in Garden Grove. Apparently The Kills were trying to play at any venue because all they had released was an EP. I immediately bought it and went home and thought about this band. I wrote the first review about them three years ago.<br /><br />At the same time the editor of Free Williamsburg is writing gems like this: \\"The latest buzz band, Interpol, is neither groundbreaking or original but they are so entertaining I am willing to cut them some slack. This newest Matador band sounds suspiciously similar to Joy Division, only with a fresh coat of wax.\\"<br /><br />I had been trying to interview The Kills for three years. I even called them up at the Chelsea Hotel. Rough Trade has an office there. I had met Allison and Jaime many times. The interviews never happened. I ended up writing a long story about my experiences with The Kills here . The people at Dimmak Records liked this so much they used it on their own site. Anyway it's three years later, and I'm a different person. I saw The Kills play some of the new songs in November 2004. Pretty much everyone was into it. They played some new songs like \\"The Good Ones\\" and \\"No Wow.\\" These songs were better than ever.<br /><br />The song \\"No Wow\\" is like most of the songs on their first album. \\"Love Is A Deserter\\" is their new techno sound. Jamie plays a cool surf guitar riff. The slow dirge \\"Dead Road 7\\" is much better than the slow blues songs of their first album. \\"The Good Ones\\" is a very cool single. It almost sounds like Bachman Turner Overdrive if they were a punk band with two members. \\"I Hate The Way You Love\\" is a noisy love song that is classic Kills. The Kills are always limited by having two members, but on songs like this they are reinventing themselves, and inventing new sounds and possibility.<br /><br />\\"At The Back Of The Shell\\" includes handclaps and dual singing. \\"Sweet Cloud\\" takes the poverty of sound and turns it into something really neat. \\"Rodeo Town\\" is their Velvet Underground type song. \\"Murdermile\\" makes use of the clicking drum sound that a few songs do on this record. \\"Ticket Man\\" is a short song with piano and vocals.

0385336810|5.0|I admit, I was a little skeptical when I first started reading this book.  I'm not usually the person who really gets into books, but this one was different.  After the first few chapters, I was hooked.  I couldn't put this book down.  Whenever I stopped reading it, it seemed like the characters lives went on pause.  Kinsella knows how to truly engross a reader in the lives of her characters.  I made time to read this book when I really didn't have it.  If you are thinking about reading this book, please, don't hesitate.  It is definitely worth the trip to the bookstore.  My only complaint is that there isn't a sequal!
B00001ZULV|5.0|Ever since I first heard \\"Invisible Touch\\", I have been a huge fan of Genesis. However, I never found the time to pick up one of their cd. Fortunately, that dilemma was solved when \\"Turn It On Again: The Hits\\", an 18 song set featuring all my favorites from the radio plus a few songs that were new to me that I really enjoyed.<br /><br />For all of Genesis's biggest and most popular hits, this collection can't be beat. Almost every top 40 hit they ever had is here, including \\"Invisible Touch\\" (a number one hit), \\"Tonight, Tonight, Tonight\\", \\"In Too Deep\\", \\"Misunderstanding\\", \\"I Can't Dance\\" and my all time favorite \\"Hold On My Heart\\". I also enjoyed the tracks I wasn't as familliar with, such as \\"Abacab\\", \\"Mama\\" and \\"Turn It On Again\\". And fans of the old Genesis get a special treat as former members Phil Collins and Peter Gabriel rejoin the group for a new version of \\"Carpet Crawlers\\".<br /><br />Overall, a great collection of Genesis's best songs. This cd is a must for any fans of pop, rock and roll or prog rock. Also recommended is \\"We Can't Dance\\", \\"Invisible Touch\\" and \\"The Lamb Lies Down On The Broadway\\".
B00063EMJ6|4.0|Besides Neil peart, neil Young is the Greatest Canadian ever! This Cd Captures a lot of his career, and such classics like Rockin in the Free World, Southern Man, Only Love..., and Cowgirl in the sand.The 16 tracks are based on airplay, sales, and internet play, so I guess these are his greatest hits. I would have added Alabama,Are You Ready For The Country,and Words, and more stuff from his later carrer like stuff off Freedom and HArvest Moon. Still, its a helluva of cd, and great for anyone just getting into Neil young. If you like Pearl Jam, youll love Neil Young.
B000002B30|3.0|There is nothing wrong with the material on here.  It's good but there is so much missing.  I know with a single disc it is hard to hit all the high points of an artist like The Boss.  My complaint is there is too much \\"Born In The USA\\" (which I consider one of Bruces weakest records even though it was his commercial high point).  There is only one track from \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" which is arguably his greatest album ever.  Also only one track from his masterpiece \\"Nebraska\\". But 5 tracks from \\"BITUSA! Plus 3 previously unreleased songs to close out the album.  Nothing wrong with these three songs but why not include \\"Promised Land\\", \\"Cadillac Ranch\\" and \\"One Step Up\\" instead.  As I said there is nothing really wrong with the music on here it is just a little post 1984 heavy.
B00008BXJF|5.0|I believed King Crimson achieved a pinnacle on Discipline that they had sadly and steadily descended from ever since.  This CD proved my belief wrong (and forced me to re-evaluate some of the other work in between).  <br /> <br />There are cuts like \\"Eyes Wide Open\\" and \\"Facts of Life\\" that in another context would simply be King Crimson competently doing what Fripp has been doing for a very long time.  On a lesser album, they might well be the high points.  But this CD contains other tracks so fresh and brilliant, that these are reduced to satisfying filler. <br /> <br />\\"The Power to Believe II\\" begins with an atmospheric movement that could be a cross between Eno and Peter Gabriel, but with an underlying tension that is unmistakably Fripp.  It then moves through a subtle, delicate and intricate percussion driven passage that flows effortlessly into a passionate and powerful King Crimson instrumental.  The progression is seamless, logical and wonderfully fresh and inventive.  This track alone is worth the full price of the CD. <br /> <br />\\"Dangerous Curves\\" is a tense and menacing instrumental, but without the harsh and abrasive aspects that can sometimes make Fripp's work a bit too challenging to listen to purely for pleasure.  This one stands up to many repeat listens. <br /> <br />\\"Happy with What You Have to be Happy With\\" will go down as one King Crimson's classic odd meter tracks.  The hook is as infectious any Fripp has composed. <br /> <br />All in all, a wonderfully fresh and inventive album infused with King Crimson's unique character.  I'm glad I gave it a chance to prove King Crimson still has worthy new territories to explore. <br />
B00000DCHI|3.0|With a 14 year career and 10 studio albums under his belt, Billy Joel was long overdue for a greatest hits album.   At the same time, Billy Joel had established himself as premier act in the music industry.   With his 1985 release \\"Billy Joel Greatest Hits Volume I and Volume II\\", Billy Joel delivers a 2 CD set that takes his \\"top hits\\" from his previous albums.   In addition, Billy adds two \\"new songs\\" (\\"You're Only Human\\" and \\"The Night is Still Young\\") - both are of the high caliber quality of music that his fans have become accustomed to.   Overall, there may be some minor quirks, but this is a solid set of Billy's work <br /> <br />I look at Billy Joel's career as having three phases.  The first phase is what I call \\"Old Billy Joel\\".    This basically includes all of his material from \\"Cold Spring Harbor\\" through \\"Turnstiles\\".   These are perhaps the strongest days as the piano sound, but they also contain most of Joel's least heard material.   The next phase is what I call \\"Middle Billy Joel\\".  This was his most successful period and covers from \\"The Stranger\\" to \\"Billy Joel Greatest Hits Volume I and Volume II\\".  Joel would go through a transition during this phase - expanding his musical horizons and exploring different avenues.  The final phase is the \\"Later Billy Joel\\" phase - this covers \\"The Bridge\\" to \\"River of Dreams\\".  \\"Greatest Hits Volume I and Volume II covers the two phases - \\"Old Billy Joel and \\"Middle Billy Joel\\". <br /> <br />As mentioned above, this collection focuses on Billy's \\"top hits\\".   With a few exceptions, this focuses on the songs that were the most commercially successful singles from his studio albums.   As a result, some songs that are considered \\"Billy Joel Classics\\" are not on here.   The most notable songs that are missing are: \\"Angry Young Man\\", \\"Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)\\",  \\"Vienna\\", \\"Honesty\\", \\"Stiletto\\", \\"Sometimes a Fantasy\\", \\"All For Leyna\\", \\"Laura\\", \\"Leave a Tender Moment Alone\\", and \\"An Innocent Man\\" (this song was included on a a later release \\"Volume 3\\").  In fairness, there are still 25 songs included over 2 CDs - so there is a lot of music and I can understand not being able to fit these songs.  In fairness, I wouldn't have dropped any of the 25 songs that were included. <br /> <br />It is important to understand that there are two versions of \\"Greatest Hits Volume I and Volume II\\".   The original release included edited (i.e. shortened) versions of several tracks from their original studio albums.  These tracks include: \\"The Stranger\\", \\"Just the Way You Are\\", \\"My Life\\", \\"Big Shot\\", and \\"Pressure\\".   This original release also includes two live versions of older songs taken from \\"Songs From the Attic\\" (\\"She's Got a Way\\" and \\"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\\").   There was a remastered edition that was released in 1998.   The nice thing is that these include the full versions of the edited songs as they were on their original studio albums.   As for the live songs, they have been replaced with the studio versions (\\"She's Got a Way\\" from \\"Cold Spring Harbor\\" and \\"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\\" from \\"Turnstiles\\"). Although I like having the live versions, I much prefer having full versions of songs to edited versions (I have no use for any song that is shortened from its original form), therefore I would advise getting the remastered version. <br /> <br />In addition to \\"Greatest Hits Volume I and II\\", there are several other compilations available.  In 1997 Billy would release \\"Greatest Hits Volume III\\" that would include songs from the \\"Later Billy Joel\\" phase plus \\"An Innocent Man\\" and \\"Keeping the Faith\\" (\\"Middle Billy Joel songs).  Billy would release a boxed set called \\"Billy Joel: Complete Hits Collection\\" that includes the remastered version of \\"Greatest Hits Volume I and II\\", \\"Greatest Hits Volume 3\\", and a fourth disk that includes outtakes and live versions from a College Tour he did.   In 2001, Billy Joel would release anothe two disc collection entitled \\"TheEssential Billy Joel\\".  This collection does include some songs missing from \\"Greatest Hits Volume I and II\\" (i.e. \\"Miami 2017\\", Honesty\\", and \\"Leave a Tender Moment Alone\\"), however that collection is missing \\"The Stranger\\", \\"Pressure\\", and  \\"Scenes From an Italian Restaurant\\".  Despite the inclusion of some of the missing songs on \\"Greatest Hits Volume I and Volume II\\", I would avoid \\"The Essential Billy Joel\\" Overall, my first choice would be to go the Boxed Set collection, but if you want to focus on just Phases 1 and 2, then get the remastered  \\"Greatest Hits Volume I and Volume II\\". <br /> <br />One thing that I like about \\"Greatest Hits Volume I and Volume II\\" is that the collection is in chronological order of when the songs are released - for the most part.  There are some minor quirks with this:  \\"She's Got a Way\\" was really from Billy's first album, so it should be the first song - however it is included just before \\"The Nylon Curtain\\" tracks because the original version of this collection had the live version from \\"Songs From the Attic\\".   On the other hand, on the original version of the collection, they include the \\"Songs From the Attic\\" version of \\"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\\" with the \\"Turnstiles\\" songs (they do get this right on the remastered release).  By having songs in chronological order, it allows me to see how the artist progresses and changes over time. <br /> <br />My version of the collection came in a \\"double CD case\\" with a nice booklet.  In an unusual move for a Greatest Hits collection - all of the lyrics are included.  The musician and production credits are included only for the new songs.  Overall, this is a great place to get those \\"Phase 1 and 2\\" Billy Joel \\"Hits\\" in one place.  I'd still recommend trying for the Boxed Set, but if not - the remastered version is the next best thing.
B00003CY5J|3.0|On many levels i think this movie strives to be as good as 1995's HEAT with De Niro and Pacino(without a cop(Pacino) hellbent on cathing the villan).The film is similar in many ways for example, in heat De Niro plays basically the same person with a different name, he has the same job \\"taking scores\\" which he did in heat, and also he was going to retire after his last job in this film(which he also was going to do in HEAT)and lastly he has almost identical dialogue that he had in HEAT. This movie has De Niro and the classic veteran actor Marlon Brando staring together, if you would have added Pacino and you would have had the HEATEDGODFATHER,but sadly you don't.The movie is good however though in that all the actors give there typical stellar performances, the most memorable being Edward Norton as a mentally retarded individual who convinces a whole Janitorial crew and security guards that he is this other person.Other than this fact everything else is very cliche and there is really nothing new here, just a heist film with all the thrills of \\"we might get caught\\" looming within it. All that said it's still seems to be worth watching.I've seen a LOT worse.
1594200106|5.0|Carlos Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n was born in Barcelona in 1964. He won the Premio Edebe for his first novel, \\"El Pr&iacute;ncipe de la Niebla\\" (Prince of the Mists). \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" is his first novel for adults, was first published in Spain in 2001 and is set in Zaf&oacute;n's home city. The book opens in the summer of 1945, only six years after the Spanish Civil War ended, and focuses on Daniel Sempere. Daniel's father runs a bookshop specializing in rare and second-hand editions, while the pair live in a bookshop directly above it. Daniels's mother died from cholera shortly after the Civil War, and was buried on his fourth birthday.<br /><br />Approaching his eleventh birthday, Daniel's father takes him to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books : a mysterious and secret place, it is a sanctuary for the protection of obscure and endangered books. When a bookshop or library closes, those titles in danger of disappearing are brought to the Cemetery by its guardians. No-one knows how long the Cemetery has been there, or who founded it. However, all those on their first visit there are allowed to 'adopt' a book - to protect it and ensure it stays alive. Daniel stumbles across and chooses a book called \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" by Julian Car&aacute;x - an author and a title unfamiliar to him. It captures his imagination so completely that he is determined to read more of Car&aacute;x's book. Unfortunately, not only are his books in short supply, but also Car&aacute;x himself proves to be something of a mystery.<br /><br />Daniel's father can only supply a few answers about the author and the book, but Gustavo Barcelo - one of his father's friends - tells Daniel he has the only copy of \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" in existence. Daniel learns more about Car&aacute;x from Clara, Gustavo's blind and orphaned niece. Clara's father, a lawyer close to the Catalan President, had been killed by Javier Fumero at Montjuïc Castle during the war. Clara's mother has subsequently died from a broken heart. Fumero remains a feared man throughout the city, though was little more than a hired assassin during the war. He fought for every side at some point, siding with the winners after the fall of Barcelona and joining the police force. Clara, in her early twenties when she first meets Daniel, was introduced to Car&aacute;x by her tutor, Monsieur Rocquefort. Like Daniel, he only owned one of Car&aacute;x's novels and was desperate to read more of them. He scoured the bookshops of Paris, where Car&aacute;x was based at the time - but found nothing further. In 1936, rumors reached him that Car&aacute;x had died - some said in a duel in Paris, others that he died in dire straits in Barcelona. Either way, it appears he had been buried in an unmarked grave.<br /><br />While Daniel is able to pick up scraps of information about the author from a variety of sources, his most loyal ally in Ferm&iacute;n Romero de Torres. Ferm&iacute;n is living on the streets when Daniel first meets him, though he finally comes to work at the bookshop. He is a hugely entertaining free-thinker, who has a fantastic turn of phrase, a strong distaste for both Franco and Inspector Fumero and an eye for the ladies. Unfortunately, the pair realise there are others also interested in Car&aacute;x. Barcelo had earlier told Daniel of a man seeking to burn all copies of Car&aacute;x's books. He later learns that this man is travelling by the name 'La&iacute;n Coubert' - an alias used in Car&aacute;x's \\"Shadow of the Wind\\" by the Devil himself. He also realises he is being followed by the very same individual...<br /><br />I didn't know a great deal about this book when I started reading it, but I was hooked within ten pages. Zaf&oacute;n hasn't so much written a novel as crafted one. Rather than following a tired formula and filling his books with clich&eacute;s, his ability to actually tell a story is clear. It's been a while since I enjoyed a book so much, and I'm looking forward to readingmore of Zaf&oacute;n's work.
B00004ZB9D|5.0|In the long run, Kravitz's sound - a vibrant, sometimes automated mixture of '60s soul and '70s rock - will likely be his legacy. Only occasionally do his songs or riffs approach anything original (playing all the instrumental parts himself sacrifices the freshness of collaborative input for tight control), and his lyrics are barely adequate at best. <br />No wonder he tends to oversing, often attempting to wrench depth of feeling from songs and arrangements that are more effective than emotional. As a pop artist, though, he's hard to touch, having crafted numerous enticing singles over his decade-long career. This, then, is where to get 'em. <br />More info : [...]
B000003C4M|5.0|These guys are responsible for starting the Thrash metal genre, inspiring and giving name to the Black Metal genre, and influencing the creation of Death Metal (although Slayer was more influential to death metal than venom). Many metal bands will name this trio from Newcastle, England as one of their biggest influences. And we are talking some big names here! Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Mayhem...the list goes on for miles and miles! the early 80's Venom released three albums which stand proudly alongside other great albums of that era: 1981's Welcome To Hell. While bands like Black Sabbath always toyed with occult lyrics and subjects, Venom took it to an almost comic level and one look at the cover will tell you why the band was such a big influence on not only sound but image. The riff of opening track  \\"Sons of Satan\\" rips right through you like a knife ripping through flesh. Motorhead-esque guitar and drum artillery fire attack you relentlessly on this album from first note to last. The music is basically classic heavy metal in the vein of Motorhead, Deep Purple, and Black Sabbath, sprinkled with a punk influence and warp speeded to an intensity that was unheard of in 1981. No keyboards, no progressive interludes, no string sections, just pure thrashing heavy metal. Now go out and buy Venom's Welcome To Hell and hear the band which helped spawn three sub-genres of heavy metal!
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix is a very good film. <br /> <br />PLOT DESCRIPTION <br />In the film a hacker, with the help of a strange character, discovers that the real world is only an illusion. In fact, artificial intelligence control us and show us a virtual world. The artificial intelligence use us like batteries and, when we're through, throw us away. There is also a legend: one day a special man will come and he will destroy the Matrix. According to a \\"free\\" man, Morpheus, Neo(the hacker)is that man. Neo has to fight against the Matrix to crack it. <br /> <br />POSITIVE ELEMENTS <br />I like the film because the idea is very novel, there are lots of fantastic special effects, there is a good plot and the actors perform very well. <br /> <br />NEGATIVE ELEMENTS <br />The soundtrack is nothing special. If you want to undestand everything, you also have to see the sequel. There are some incredible scenes, but they're impossible in \\"our world\\". <br /> <br />WHO WOULD LIKE THE FILM? <br />In the film there are some technical words and so it's for people who like tecnology and computers. I think that young children wouldn't understand the film.
B00006RINF|5.0|The band seems to finally live up to its potential and promise. Gothic Metal giants Lacuna Coil have hit the jack pot with yet another smash hit of an album. The vocals continue to definitely be the featured instrument--both in talent, and also in production. Evanescence may have got the popularity, but Lacuna Coil surpasses them in many ways. The steady and mesmerizing \\"Swamped\\" opens the project, while a good chorus marks \\"Heaven's a Lie\\". \\"Humane\\" is liquid and moving, \\"Tight Rope\\" is good, and the title track features some really nice bass work. This is one of the best Gothic Metal CDs of all time, but for the best in Gothic Metal check out Virgin Black.
B00018D3RI|5.0|For true 'Starsky & Hutch' fans, this is an excellent box set. I give it 5 out of 5 stars simply because any fan of 'S&H' will no doubt love it. <br />  'Starsky & Hutch' was a ground-breaking show when it debuted in 1975. Based loosely on the early-70s TV movie 'Super-Cops', itself a true-life inspired story, 'Starsky & Hutch' blended the buddy-formula that worked so well in 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid', as well as 'The Sting' with the conventions of TV cop show simplicities, throwing in a lot of personal touches along the way. <br />  Critics initially lambasted the show for being little more than an ultra-violent shoot-em-up peppered with endless car chases, but the sincere sensitivity displyed by the main characters, fleshed out by the very-likable leads Paul Michael Glaser as 'Starsky' and David Soul as 'Hutch', as well as supporting cast Antonio Fargas as thier snitch-buddy 'Huggy Bear'(he was NOT a pimp!)and Bernard Hamilton as thier tough-as-nails 'Captain Dobey' was enough to take the hard 'edge' off of the violent action that would have quickly become boring and uninteresting. <br />  The TV show 'S.W.A.T.', another Spelling-Goldberg production airing during 1975 was also initially a huge hit, packed with even more of the audience-grabbing uber-violence. Unfortunately, that show did not have the talents or likeability of a cast like Glaser, Soul, Fargas and Hamilton to give it any lasting appeal, and it was soon gone from the air-waves. <br />  What gave this show it's lasting appeal was the near-perfect balance of action, friendship, humor and drama, all capped off with theme music, as well as incidental episode music that was far and away the best ever used on an hour long weekly cop series up until that time. <br />  The opening theme music for the first season, as well as much of this season's incidental music was by the award-winning Lalo Schifrin, most famous for his unforgettable them to 'Mission: Impossible', as well as his jazzy theme for the private-detective series 'Mannix', starring Mike Conners. Schifrin also was responsible for the award winning scores from both 'Dirty Harry', the Clint Eastwood film and 'Bullit', the Steve McQueen actioner famous for its near-perfect 15-minute car chase scene through the streets and hills of San Francisco. <br /> Along with Schifrin's unbeatable contributions, many other famous film composers contributed to the 'Starsky & Hutch' sound during its freshman season. <br />  Probably the most amazing thing about the first season of 'Starsky & Hutch' is the fact that of the 23 episodes, only two of the stories were written originally for this show. <br />  This show was cutting-edge for its time, tackling subjects rarely, if ever shown on a typical hour long TV show before. <br />  Of the entire first season, almost every episode is a classic, with no stinkers in the bunch. <br />  The biggest treat to fans for this set is the inclusion of the rarely-seen pilot episode. Like most pilot shows, there are a few differences from the series once it was underway, but they are very few and barely noticeable. In other words...they got it right from the beginning and didn't have to 'fix it' when it became a series. The most obvious change is that 'Dobey' is played by Richard Ward in the pilot, who was unavailable for the series. Bernie Hamilton then became the beloved 'Dobey' for the entire 4-year run of the series. The pilot is a little more gritty and rough than what the series was, but all the elements are clearly in place. After all these years, seeing the pilot again is a real treat! <br /> Unlike most cop-shows from the era, 'Starsky & Hutch' gave its two leads plenty of opportunities for some real acting by letting the characters show flaws, hesitations and quirks along with the usual heroic and unflinching abilities of most TV cops. <br /> 'The Fix' is probably one of the best hours of episodic drama ever produced for American televison, even by today's standards. As revenge for 'stealing' his girlfriend, a viscious and insanely jealous mobster gets Hutch strung-out on heroin, simply to get him to reveal where Hutch is hiding her. David Soul's performance in this episode is a tour-de-force display as he takes the viewer through every harrowing stage of Hutch's ordeal from being kidnapped, shot-up while blindfolded, beaten to near-death while high, and eventually left for dead as a strung-out junkie too weak and disoriented to even know who his friends are. This episode was so disturbing it was banned from all European broadcasts of 'Starsky & Hutch' until the early 1990s! <br /> 'Texas Longhorn' tells the story of good ole' boy millionaire car-dealership owner 'Zack Tyler', who's wife is brutally raped and murdered. Instead of the typical TV show rage and anger, Zack's sedate and disturbing depression draws so much sympathy from Starsky & Hutch (as well as the audience!) that it is hard to find fault with him for hunting down the rapists responsible for his wife's death. Another touching episode. <br /> 'Deadly Imposter' features the awesome Canadian-actor Art Hindle as Starsky & Hutch's friend John Colby from thier police-academy days. Colby's surprise return to Bay City, asking his pals Starsky & Hutch to help him find his ex-wife and son is in reality a cover for the fact that he is now a highly-paid assassin, using his friends Starsky & Hutch to unknowingly help him track down a mob informant marked for assassination...by Colby! The hand-to-hand combat between two former close friends on the beach at the end of the episode is startlingly realistic and quite dramatic. Another great episode! <br />  'The Hostages' tells the suspenseful story of a young armored car driver(John Ritter) and his pregnant wife being held hostage who will be killed unless he turns in all the money from the day's pick-ups. A well-acted and well paced race-against-time episode. <br />  These are only a few of the great episodes, and my favorites from this season. But rest assured...every episode from this set is a great one! <br />  The over-riding theme set up during the first season is that 'Starsky & Hutch' are truly best friends, not just co-workers. They would willingly give thier life for each other if necessary, and thier dedication to each other, as well as 'doing the right thing', even if it means bending the rules a bit is inspirational and makes the characters seem like real people. <br /> Glaser and Soul ARE 'Starsky & Hutch' and are unforgettable. Stiller and Wilson were just acting. <br />  The picture quality and sound on this set is generally excellent. Some artifacts from the original source films are present, mostly in the opening credits on some episodes. <br />  The packaging is pretty nice, with a colorful box, a nice fold-out section to hold the 5 discs, and plenty of close-ups of the famous Torino to look at. Unfortunately for true aficianados, the Gran Torino used on the package is the version used in the new Stller and Wilson 'Starsky & Hutch' movie, not the 'real' Torino from the TV show.That's undestandable, since the original cars are owned by a collector and are in original, unrestored condition...meaning they are pretty rough! In fact, there is a short featurette in the 'special features' all about these origianl cars. <br /> The 'special features' also includes a nice up-to-date set of all-new interviews with Glaser, Soul, Fargas and the producers. Very enlightening! <br /> The only sore spot for me is the 'Original TV Promo Spots' included. They are in fact NOT original 'promo spots', but are actually the promo spots produced in 1980 as part of the syndication package for the entire series. Its still cool to see them though. <br /> If you are a fan of 'Starsky & Hutch' this set is for you. You will definately enjoy it, so just get it. <br /> Do it.Do it.........Do it.
B0007DAZW8|3.0|&#65279;Daft Punk returns with \\"Human After All\\", the follow up to 2001's critically lauded and hated on \\"Discovery\\". Not one of the most prolific groups, Daft Punk has always been known to take their time between albums, and this one was no exception. But \\"Human After All\\" distinguishes itself from the rest of their work by not striving for absolute perfection. This album's strengths definitely don't lie in the details. \\"Human After All\\" took only six weeks to record, and it shows. While the songs do fit together, they seem only married by their proximity of creation, and work together only long enough to tell the listener that they're only \\"human after all\\". Nearly all of the songs that comprise this album resemble the cling clang that was their pre \\"Homework\\" recordings. In fact some of the stuff here could be mistaken for Sven Vath songs, which is an utter surprise since they've so relied on melodic electronic pop in the past. The lead single \\"Human After All\\" is no \\"One More Time\\", or \\"Around The World\\", but is still in no way an indicator of the way the album will fall into an undertow of murkiness and clutter. This album is loopy even for an electronic record, and some songs drone on relentlessly with only trace amounts of variation. \\"Make Love\\" the album's fifth song functions as a bridge that divides the album's cling clanging into two acts. That song has a truly beautiful prototype Daft Punk piano loop, but even it gets loop heavy after a while, and would only be a standout on this album and no others. For those who don't pay attention to the particulars, they'll probably find that this is still an effective electronic album, because it is. Even Daft Punk's weakest record (which this is) is a release of some quality, and is worthy of their follower's time. You have to admit that there is something lovable about an underpolished electronic record. Especially since the genre depends so heavily on sheen.<br /><br />STANDOUT TRACKS: 1. HUMAN AFTER ALL, 5. MAKE LOVE, 8. TELEVISION RULES THE NATION, 10. EMOTION. TELEVISION RULES THE NATION, 10. EMOTION
B000002J2B|4.0|I was a young child back when \\"Your Own Special Way\\" was an AM radio hit and I remember liking it, so when I eventually became a prog fanatic, this album was a bit of a sentimental favorite since it housed the song that introduced me to Genesis.<br /><br />Wind and Wuthering and the double live Seconds Out marked the end of the prog era for Genesis before a long descent into pop mediocrity.  Some proggers point to tracks like \\"Your Own Special Way\\" and \\"Afterglow\\" as signs of the impending apocalypse but I happen to like both of those songs, with the electric piano interlude on \\"Your Own Special Way\\" a particular favorite Genesis moment.<br /><br />The opening \\"Eleventh Earl of Mar\\" seems to be reaching for \\"Dance on a Volcano\\" but falls just short despite a fine effort.  I like it quite a bit, but for me it lacks the killer melodic hook that would have fully sealed the deal.  \\"Wot Gorilla\\" is a fusion-y piece that betrays Phil Collins' concurrent work with Brand X.  I wish this piece could have been longer, but then again like many Genesis records this was already over 50 minutes long.<br /><br />The double-whammy instrumental \\"Unquiet Slumbers for the sleepers/in that quiet earth\\" is a classic Genesis prog jam, probably the last studio example of the classic Genesis sound.  The more \\"serious\\" prog tracks are \\"One for the Vine,\\" \\"All in a Mouses's Night\\" and \\"Blood on the Rooftops.\\"  \\"One for the Vine\\" features some particularly effective vocals and keyboards while \\"Blood on the Rooftops\\" marks Steve Hackett's last great moment on a Genesis studio record with some excellent classical guitar work.  All three of these tracks stand with the best of the post-Peter Gabriel era.<br /><br />This album has a lot of \\"lasts\\" and carries a certain bittersweet melancholia reinforced by the stark cover art and lyrics like those on the post-apocalyptic \\"Afterglow.\\"  An autumnal recording in more ways than one, and Genesis' last great prog record.
0679720200|4.0|To be put on trial for killing a man and then tried for a lack of emotion makes for a rather interesting day. The main character, Meursault, in Albert Camus's novel,_The Stranger_, experiences this after attending his mother's funeral in Marengo. He is sent to jail and then put on trial for the murder of a Arab man while at a beach. The novel consists of 154 pages divided into  two parts, each part consisting of a number of chapters. This drama is directed toward a wide range of readers, as it is fairly short in length and not a difficult reading. The criminal drama formula is skewed by Camus, creating an addicting read. One becomes sucked into reading the intense novel in one sitting. Albert Camus's The Stranger, effectively and efficiently achieves this goal of enlightening the reader with a unique take on issues.        <br /> While on trial the matter being discussed shifts from Meursault's killing of an Arab to questioning of his lack of sorrow and remorse for, both, his action of shooting a stranger and his reaction to his mother's death. He is then labeled a threat to society and sentenced to death. The philosophy then comes out of Meursault the night prior to his date of execution. With some help from the Chaplain, who continues to push Meursault to believe in God, Meursault comes to a final conclusion that humans are born to die. \\"From the dark horizon of my future a sort of slow, persistent breeze had been blowing toward me, all my life long. . .\\"(152). For Meursault, death is freedom and new found happiness. There is no reason for sorrow over ones death. \\"No one, no one in the world had any right to weep for her\\"(154).    <br /> Camus places the character of Meursault in Algiers, where \\"The sun was scorching hot\\"(31). References to the heat and the sun, such as this,  are mentioned repeatedly. Camus's elaborate descriptions of the surroundings in conjunction with concise character descriptions formulates the unique style of the novel. Madame Meursault has died and her son comes to her funeral. There he stays with her in her coffin through the night. The others staying at the Home joined him for the night. He \\"had an absurd impression that they had come to sit in judgment\\"(11). Unaware that soon he will be sitting in judgment in a courthouse. After the funeral he used his extra day off from work to see meet with a former coworker named Marie. He and Marie swim in the pool and go to a comedy later that night, where he \\"kissed her, but rather clumsily\\"(24). Two days later, Meursault returns to work and later that evening talks with a neighbor named Raymond Sintes, a known pimp. Raymond is having a dispute with his mistress and Meusault agrees to help get rid of her by writing her a letter. The next night the police come to the apartment complex and break up a fight between Raymond and his mistress. A few days later Marie, Meursault, and Raymond are invited to their friend Masson's beach house. It is here where Raymond and two Arabs, one the brother of his mistress, begin to fight and Meursault shoots one of them. He is sent to jail, put on trial, where his charge is changed from murder to lack of grievances, and is then given the death sentence. It is now that he finds the meaninglessness of sorrow. As stated preciously, \\"From the dark horizon of my future. . .\\"(152). The story comes to an end with Meursault hoping \\"that on the day of my execution there should be a huge crowd of spectators and that they should greet me with howls of execration\\"(154). Death is a new freedom for him and his mother. They are able to be happy once again. <br /> Albert Camus's The Stranger, effectively and efficiently achieves this goal of enlightening the reader with a unique take on issues. The book will force to reader to stay on his toes, especially with the plots twists towards the end of the novel. I feel that if I had to pick one book to write a song(*) about, it would have to be this book. <br /> <br />* The Cure: Killing an Arab
B00000JMG7|1.0|I have bought most of the Rory Gallagher studio discs, and most of them, with the exception of Jinx, did not seem to capture the fire and soul of his playing...    If you have never been jolted to your soul by Gallagher, THIS IS THE DISK YOU WERE LOOKING FOR!  Disc 1, IMHO, is the strongest on the set.  From the opening notes of \\"Calling Card\\" the guitar grabs you by the lapels, and does not let go...  From stand-alone Stratocaster pyrotechnics to slashing incendiary slidework, the talent shines forth.  I have no idea how the American market failed to \\"notice\\" this man's playing, and looking back, note this with increasing sadness.  Buy this CD as a treat to yourself... Once you have been \\"hooked\\", run a search to see some of the albums where he popped up... My best example is an Albert King live album called \\"Blues from the Road\\" featuring Rory on an extended jam...
B00030590I|5.0|<br /> <br />Just to get this out of the way, Kill Bill's director did not make/direct this movie (for those who are unaware of this). I suppose you can say he simply presented this movie directed by Yimou Zhang to America. So about as far as I can say, \\"HERO\\" is a very beautifully done moive. It doesn't give away its plot away early in the movie, there are many twists that may confuse you and the acting is topnotch. The story goes like this: Je-Li's charater \\"Nanmeless one\\" comes to the king of Qin with the message of death concerning three deadly assasins bringing with him their weapons and thus, tells his story of how he klls them. But the king of Qin has doubts that he is telling the complete truth.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The fighting in this movie is the best I've since I've watched \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\"; The simple retelling of Nameless one's story and the battles he part-takes in againsts the assassins are awsome save for one that concerns dancing across the water, that battle was hard for me to grasp. But when you boil it all down its actually a movie about Romance and revenge like most Chinise/Jpaanese movies placed in the fuedal era. The audio in the movie boils down to dobly digital 5.1 surround sound, with the choice of of English or Chinese among other languages.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />But if your going to watch the movie in any kind of lanauge The orignal Chinese audio is the way to go. English dubs is still the hardest things for me to watch in any kind of movie that wasn't recorded in that lanauage. So to save yourself from any embarassing or agonizing choices . . . just pick the Chinese dailouge and activate the English subtitles. You'll enjoy the movie better that way. --- [a 5 out of 5]

B00000JLWW|3.0|Titanic after years of being parody with all that stale Titanic as I still rember is still a pretty good movie even for its flaws and certainly a left turn for James Cameron who is best rembered for handling the terminator series. The obvious massive production is worth noting but the general charachter focus wasnt actually half bad. But the love story seems a bit familiar (rich girl falling in lvoe with poor boy). But if anything though it still remains a satisfying film. its big and could've been a whole lot dumber

Plot ides traight out of every zombie movie ever made,charaters either appear and die or jsut live to say stupid tough guy dialogue. The movie wouldve seemed lame at any point in time with plotholes the size of craters. The movie tries to cram alot plot in for the lack of anything inovlving charchter. But i guess what can you expect, not much, since almost every video game to movie has sucked. The first one was bad, this one even worse. The movie seems achingly stale and repetive with some of the msot heavy handed action scenes complete with stale bullet time effects and slo motion and fast motion effects that have gone past expiration date. everything adds to ntohing. jsut maybe some geeks wet dream of the game coming to life. as a movie its hacked to pieces
B0007DAZW8|1.0|As a long time fan, I eagerly awaited the four-years-in-the-making new CD from Daft Punk and bought it instantly without even hearing it - BIG MISTAKE! C'mon, it took the Daft guys FOUR YEARS for this?!  It sounds like it was cranked out one lazy afternoon in between a photo shoot for The Gap and an interview in Jockey Slut. Unlike Homework or Discovery or even any of their remixes for other artists, \\"Human After All\\" only offers some of the most incredibly, stunningly BORING, flat, dull, repetitive, and just plain annoying \\"music\\" they've ever created, if you can even call it that - it's as if Daft Punk lost the plot and tried to emulate all the bands that have copied them, a law of severely diminishing returns. How ironic that LCD's new single hails them (i.e. Daft Punk Is Playing at My House), but Daft Punk themselves fail to deliver any kind of grooves to sustain their own legacy? So they've discovered guitars? Big deal. They need to re-learn how to write rich, textured electro/house grooves like they did in prior releases instead of this tired rehash - the songs build up, repeat played-out loops, and then...NO PAY OFF.  The most numbing, frustrating example is the last and LOOOOONGEST track, Emotion - emotion? More like lack thereof.  Minutes and minutes leading...nowhere.  Many of the average, mediocre \\"songs\\" here sound like first-draft rough demo fragments that they never bothered to flesh out and develop into song structures or at least DJ tools you'd want to ever hear again.  The whole Vocodor thang is really, really played out.  Enough said.  Amazing that Daft Punk could churn out something so warm and uplifting and brilliantly simply as Together's \\"So Much Love to Give\\" on Roule, but then that track blows away anything on this major full-length release. Too bad it's not included here as even a bonus track - if it was, it would immediately expose the poor quality of the rest of \\"Human After All\\" tracks found here. Cmon, admit it, is there anything even remotely interesting, engaging, or even danceable on this CD as past hits like \\"Around the World\\" \\"Faster Harder\\" \\"One More Time\\" \\"Da Funk\\"?  I didn't think so.  Sadly, this horrible, disappointing, flat-out annoying \\"work of art\\" will be sold tossed in the bargain bins soon - and I have a hunch you'll be seeing truckloads more in the .99 cent bins soon. Sorry guys.
B00003CXTG|1.0|movies like these make me give art films better reviews. Movies like this seems to be the corporate whores of movies. and that jugernaught of these projects is usually bruckheimer. But then again what to expect of him as a producer anymore. This embaressingly bad movie is stuffed with cheesiness up to its knees, bland drama, bombastic action, and hollow charchters that are a staple for bruckheimer porductions. movies like this are ripe for self parody. but somehow the movie peaks at average at one point and thats the pearl harbor battle both violent and intense but painfully fake looking. but whatever bruckheimer has produced one maybe two really good films that arent brainless (\\"rember the titans\\" and \\"black hawk down\\") but thats because they had good directors. here its micheal bay hacking it up again (i think its micheal aby). but at movie a clocking in at 3 hours this is supreme overkill. I enjoyed the action for the 20-25 minutes it was on for.
B0007GAEGC|1.0|Simply awful. Total dreck. Avoid at all costs.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|mainly this has to do with the locations and in even worse case the whole seems to boggle into a travelog. There really isnt much here. there isnt a storyline to speak of and the pace is the slowest ive ever seen. Bill Murrary has a few funny lines and his performance is understated but too much of the movie is spent in silence. Scarrlett johansen is ok as the love interest. The movie seems far to concered with visuals and making the location Japan itself more the focus as if it were a charachter, i couldnt help myself but lose interest.it also doesnt help the movie seems over self indulgent and disconnected. The movie goes nowhere and ends the same way.the movie had the potential of giving Bill Murrary something to do but instead it focus' less on the charachters and more on the art school visual que's. For me its all mostly about the charachters and plot. this one seems lacking in both
0679720200|4.0|The Stranger, by Albert Camus, focuses on the life of a French office worker named Mersault. Mersault lives in the city of Algiers and enjoys mild popularity. His \\"best friends\\" include a pimp and an abusive pet owner. He has what one could call a love interest, but he is not truly interested in her for more than sexual purposes. He is a man living life with a silent apathy, almost detached from the world around him. The story is told through his eyes, and even with his viewpoint, one can see how cold a man he is. In the height of an unusually warm day, he kills an Arab. He is then jailed and put on trial, but the question Camus leaves with readers is whether or not he is being tried for murder or his inability to show feelings? Camus's novel is an exposition on the theme of alienation, but with a twist, the alienation is brought upon by the main character. The Stranger is a worthwhile read that examines what happens when \\"man is stripped naked in the face of the absurd\\". <br /> <br />Camus employs several literary techniques to convey his overall themes in the novel. The first, and most noticeable, is the characterization of Mersault. Mersault is a character that most can relate to. He holds a job, has a few friends, lives in an apartment complex, and holds what would seem to be an ordinary life. However, when one looks deeper into his personality, one can see some glaring defects. The book opens with him attending the funeral of his mother (referred to as Maman in the translation). Instead of being struck with grief, he is indifferent. \\"For now, its almost as if Maman weren't dead. After the funeral, though, the case will be closed, and everything will have a more official feel to it\\" (3). Rather than be stricken with grief, he is more indifferent to his mother's passing, with no hint of remorse. The oddity of his behavior is further explored when we get a look at his romantic relationship with Marie. Marie is highly interested in Mersault, but it does not seem hewants her for more than pleasure. \\"A minute later she asked me if I loved her. I told her it didn't mean anything but that I didn't think so\\" (35). He is reluctant to admit any feeling he may have for her, revealing his immaturity as a human being and the under-development of his emotional skills, this is even further displayed in another discussion with Marie regarding marriage. \\"Then she pointed out that marriage was a serious thing and I said no. She stopped talking for a minute and looked at me without saying anything. Then she spoke. She wanted to know if I would have accepted the same proposal from another woman with whom as I was involved in the same way. I said sure\\" (42). Mersault does not know what love is, and is incapable of reaching to Marie or anyone else around him, in a world of humanity, to many, he appears peculiar for this reason. His inability to show remorse will ultimately end up costing him. <br /> <br />The other tool employed by Camus is his use of language and syntax within the novel. In the notes of the translator of the novel, Camus admittedly tried to employ a more American style of writing, trying to adopt the Hemingway tradition of short sentences. He ultimately achieves this goal, as can be seen from the following passage. <br />\\"We just sat there like that for quite a while. The woman's sighs and sobs were quiting down. She sniffed a lot\\" (11). Camus uses this \\"American system\\" of writing for to reasons. First, he does it to convey the dialect of Mersault. Mersault is a man of few words, and most of his dialogues consist of \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" responses. The second is to make the novel more accessible to the public. The text is admittedly simple, but the themes and questions it raises are not. Thus the intent of Camus through his diction is to make his book accessible to all but be understood completely by few. <br /> <br /> Overall, Camus does a fine job of introducing themes in the novel, though most truly come to be near the end of thetext. One of the first themes is insensitivity used as a crutch to protect oneself. This occurs all throughout the novel, but in particular, the first chapter dealing with Maman's death is the best example. \\"Then I felt like having a smoke. But I hesitated because I didn't know if I could do it with Maman there. I thought about it; it didn't matter. I offered the caretaker a cigarette, and we smoked\\"(8). Another theme is the idea of a man's lack of sensitivity costing him his freedom. Most of the basis for the prosecution's argument in Mersault's trial relies on the fact that Mersault is insensitive. Another theme is alienation. Mersault, while awaiting his trial, is seated in the court room and realizes, \\"I couldn't make out a single face\\" (83). Mersault begins to realize just how different from everyone else he truly was. In many cases, he is a martyr because of these differences. Immaturity is another theme. When Mersault thinks of women he thinks about women in the sense of sexual pleasure, not in the sense of commitment. Camus hits every theme that could be imaginable when thinking of \\"man's nakedness when faced with the absurd. <br /> <br /> Although a short read, Camus's Stranger is a simply written text with a complex main character and overall theme. Mersault's immaturity makes one pity him, but his insensitivity is so grossly pronounced in most situations that one cannot help but want him out of existence. In many ways, Mersault is a carbon copy of Scott Peterson. Though their crimes are entirely different, both men suffered a serious mental deficiency when it came to showing emotion. Eventually, for both men, their cold hearts led to their ultimate demise, which begs the question, is emotion the only thing that separates man from monster? <br /> <br />
006016848X|1.0|Whiel there's no doubt that there are ways in which men act and women act and we need to understand those ways in order to really understand one another, this book is a little too cutesy and fluffy for my hubby & I. Gray seems to go to extremes on what he believes men and women are like as a whole. My hubby and I could not relate fully to anything he wrote about the opposite sex because was just overkill. My hubby was doen w/ this book less then 2 chapters in because he just got sick of the repetitivness and cutesy crap. I reviews through it to see if I coudl find anythign worth while and I did not find anythign we could use. There's a reason this book can be found for 45cents! The info in it is worth about that much.<br /><br />There's no denying that the differences that seem to be ingrained in men & women which make the opposite sex annoyed beyond belief need to be realized in order to help progress relationships and to not try and recognize these differences is very ignorant. I agree w/ the path Gray is on, but his method of going about portraying these differences and what the differences are are just too much. I felt as if I were reading a children's story opposed to a book targeted to adults. There's far too many other relationship books and workbooks out there that focus on the differences between the sexes to ever need to buy this silly book.
0671027344|4.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower, by Stephen Chbosky, is narrated by a young boy name Charlie. Charlie is a 15 yr old boy with an endless amount of questions about life, love, and the world in general. Wallflower is strongly reminiscent of JD Salinger's Catcher in the Rye. The book is a series of letters written by Charlie to an anonymous reader. Charlie tells the reader about his life. These letters ultimately lead up to a major turning point in Charlie's life. The themes in the book deal with the coming of age of a young adolescent boy, as well as the desire to fit in and become accepted by his peers. You, as the reader, are unaware of whom Charlie is writing these letters to, only that \\"... she said you listen and understand and didn't try to sleep with that person at the party even though you could have.\\"(p. 2) I found this book to be a classic coming of age story with a surprisingly tragic twist in the end, and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.  <br /> Chbosky's use of tone and diction contributes to the overall effectiveness of the book. Chbosky uses an adolescent tone to convey the image of a young writer. Charlie has a very free form of writing. His English teacher Bill, tells him that he uses improper grammar and punctuation. \\"Bridget who is crazy said that sometimes she thought about suicide when commercials came on during TV.\\"(3) He is constantly running his sentences together, and often uses unnecessary words. \\"First of all, Bill gave me a C on my To Kill a Mockingbird essay because he said that I run my sentences together. I am trying no to practice not to do that.\\"(14) The way he speaks is very similar to the way two teenagers would hold a conversation. Charlie doesn't For example, he often precedes his sentences with the word \\"incidentally.\\" These small additions to the text help to convince the reader of the narrator's age. Chbosky effective use of diction and style gives a strong message of the audience that he is appealing to.  <br /> Chbosky also has the ability to help the reader relate to Charlie. Throughout the book, Charlie experiences many \\"firsts.\\" At one point, Charlie goes to his first party with his new friends, Sam and Patrick. He describes his feeling by saying, \\"I have since bought the record, and I would tell you what is was, but truthfully, it's not the same unless you're driving to your first real party, and you are sitting in the middle seat of a pickup with two nice people when it starts to rain.\\"(33) When Charlie describes this feeling, the reader can almost feel the excitement and anticipation that he is feeling. Chbosky effortlessly conveys the feelings and emotions of Charlie. It is so easy to relate to Charlie that at times, it feels as if he is a close friend, sharing his feelings. <br /> The book is extremely well written and is able to draw the reader in and hold their interest until the last pages of the book. However, there are several things that I would like to have been told. Near the end of the book, there is a twist in the plot. It is something that Charlie realizes at the same time as the reader. When reading this book, it is important to pay attention to the subtlety used by the author. When I first read the book, I almost missed the turning point in the book because of how discreet the author was. I would also have liked to have more detail on the events that preceded the author's realization. <br /> In The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Stephen Chbosky is successful in persuading the reader that he is an average fifteen year old boy. Chbosky does this by providing the reader with a voice reflective of an adolescent. He also draws the reader in by putting the narrator in situations which many readers can relate to. Altogether, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, is an extremely interesting, well written book about the struggles of a young boy's coming to peace with himself.  <br />
B0007GAEGC|5.0|Wow is all I can say. I don't know how else to get across just how remarkable these women are. I just finished watching this performed on PBS, as some of the other reviewers have. During the show, I was especially taken aback by Meav's voice. (This is her official website: [...] incase you're interested.) <br /> <br />She blew me away and brought me to tears (a rarity) with her rendition of \\"Danny Boy\\" and consistantly gave me chills throughout the show. But that isn't to say the other women weren't absolutely awe-inspiring. Another song that stood out was the ladies' ensemble performance of 'Somewhere\\" from Westside Story - which I was astonished to find absent from the cd.. The harmonies were assembled and executed quite perfectly. <br /> <br />If you've ever wondered how the voices of angels might sound, I believe these women are just about as close as you could get within these sublunary bounds. <br /> <br />P.S. Celtic Woman seems to appeal to a variety of listeners - as evident by the audience members expressions during the show and the people who have reviewed this cd thus far. I'm 18, and I would recommend this CD to ANYONE who loves music - regardless of age.
B0000029GA|5.0|Nas or Nasir Jones first release was an instant classic with a ten track disc.  From the jazzed up tunes to the straight sampled loops with a street edge tailored well with the golden child's distinct flow and milky voice.  No guest features, or at that time, except for AZ on \\"Life's A Bitch\\".  One of the many standouts, \\"One Love\\" is a letter to a friend serving time, while sounding like he's having a conversation.  This street disciple has a way like an blueprint to a skyscraper, adding descriptive detail and life to his lyrics as the landscape.

B000000OTY|4.0|\\"Secret World\\" live documents the tour for \\"Us\\"-- the setlist is biased towards later material, seven songs from \\"Us\\", four from \\"So\\", \\"Shaking the Tree\\" and one new song leave only two tracks from the early part of Gabriel's career-- brief instrumental \\"Slow Marimbas\\" from \\"Birdy\\" and \\"Solsbury Hill\\" from his debut album.  Performs include Gabriel regulars Manu Katche (drums), Tony Levin (bass), David Rhodes (guitar), plus vocalist Paula Cole, keyboard player Jean Claude Naimro, violinist Shankar, doudouk player Levon Minassian, and vocalists Papa Wemba, Reddy Mela Amissi and Styno Mubi Matadi.  The result is a blend of Gabriel's pop and world sensibilities executing on stage. <br /> <br />Highlights are numerous, the execution of the show is flawless, from the powerful, building \\"Come Talk to Me\\" to the triumphant \\"In Your Eyes\\" vocal tour de force.  Of particular note are the largely wordless \\"Across the River\\", with superb vocalizations from Gabriel and great guitar from Rhodes, a great take on \\"Shaking the Tree\\" and a powerful reading of \\"Washing of the Water\\". <br /> <br />Its not quite as good as \\"Plays Live\\"-- but I'm biased, I prefer Gabriel's third and fourth albums to \\"So\\" and \\"Us\\".  Nonetheless, this is a great live set.
044651652X|1.0|Saw stories about the audiences at his book signings around the country when the book came out. By and large the audiences were made up of women in the 40-55 years old age range--precisely the Harlequin Romancers of the world who were probably in deadend marriages and yearned for the escapist fantasy Waller provided. But as a novel? Full disclosure: I never got past page 16. Couldn't do it. The writing was that bad. Just horrible cliches, awkward phrasing. And I must say how hilarious to read others defending their uplifting experience with bad literature with \\"If you didn't like it, you must never have been in love!\\" <br />Oh honey, yes we have. And are. We just don't want to waste our time reading bad writing. Whatever the story...
B000065V9Y|3.0|Peter Gabriel's followup to \\"So\\" must have been one of the more difficult albums to make-- with huge singles like \\"In Your Eyes\\" and \\"Sledgehammer\\" on \\"So\\", repeat expectations were high.  Gabriel, however, has never really been known as one to rest on his laurels, and his sound has evolved over time.  This album is no exception.  Gabriel regulars David Rhodes (guitar), Tony Levin (bass), and Manu Katche (drums) are present again, along with producer Daniel Lanois and engineer David Bottrill.  Additionally, Sinead O'Connor sings on a pair of tracks, and whole bunch of other performers, including Brian Eno, Hassam Ramzy, Shankar, Peter Hammill and John Paul Jones show up.<br /><br />The album works best when Gabriel spreads his wings and covers new directions.  \\"Blood of Eden\\", \\"Steam\\" and \\"Kiss That Frog\\" are a bit too much of the same mold and formula of the last album.  Don't get me wrong, they're decent songs, but Gabriel does better more when finding new directions.<br /><br />Songs like \\"Come Talk to Me\\", with its great harmonized vocal and brilliant percussion, the funky and emotional \\"Love to Be Loved\\", and the positively angry and haunting \\"Digging in the Dirt\\" succeed much better.  The latter appears to be the natural successor in the chain of brilliant songs like \\"Family Snapshot\\", but adds an aggression not found in any of Gabriel's other really dark songs.  Also of note are the pseudo-electronica of \\"Only Us\\"  and \\"Fourteen Black Paintings\\" and the bubbling, funky \\"Secret World\\", the three of which in their own way I think paint the way for Gabriel's next album, and the delicate \\"Washing of the Water\\", one of the really unrecognized gems in Gabriel's catalog.<br /><br />Overall, its a decent album, but a lot of the material is not quite up to the level of expectations that \\"Peter Gabriel 3\\", \\"Security\\", \\"So\\" and \\"Passion\\" placed on Gabriel's music.
B000053V7O|5.0|Dexter Gordon is Dale Turner, an ex-patriot jazz musician living in Paris and playing nightly at the Blue Note. (His character is based loosely on Lester Young and Bud Powell, but mainly it is all Dexter.) A young Frenchman (Francois Cluzet) idolizes him and later befriends him. Dex has problems, mainly booze, and between blowing gigs seems most concerned about how to get something to drink. The cliche of the self-tortured jazz musician who's got to find something new to say on his horn every night is, of course, the main focus of the film. (That this is the ONLY way to greatness for a jazzman is the great myth for the artform. But it sells.) Dex gets homesick for New York, returns, falls into his old habits, misses the flight back to Paris, and soon dies. The movie is overly long, but Gordon is mesmerizing. Dexter speaks slowly, as if from behind a veil (Gordon was ill at the time and living in obscurity in Mexico when he agreed to do the movie); he had much input on the film, creating his own dialogue and insuring accuracy. The picture has faults, to be sure, but it's a mighty achievement nonetheless. The music, of which there is plenty, is, of course, top-notch.

In his diaries he makes a big deal of seeing the king, and it's not very often, and it's NEVER about stages or plays. It's silly that they even have Pepys wandering around the stage and the actors that much, he certainly didn't write as if he did. <br /> <br />Anyway, the movie was mostly boring, but sometimes laughable. Billy Crudup's performance was just silly. The way he talked like a girl and did his arm gestures - well, sure, it might have really been like that, I don't know, but it's sure enough to make you chuckle when you see it in a movie. I have to admit, I lost respect for Billy Crudup after seeing this. As for Claire Danes, she can't act - well, if she DOES act, it's mostly her overacting, scrunching her face all angry or intense, sometimes yelling in that silly fake English accent that almost (but not quite) rivals Winona Ryder's accent in \\"Dracula.\\" <br /> <br />I can't really say I \\"learned\\" much from this movie. They portrayed almost everyone of historical reality in a false way, so why would I trust them to portray the \\"real\\" stage life of that period? Best go read a book on the subject if it interested me. Which it doesn't really. As for Pepys' journal, that's grand entertainment. I'll stick with that.

0783219695|5.0|For the over 40 year old viewer, \\"Apollo 13\\" recaptures the feeling of America at that time when we were still the \\"can do\\" people. As with \\"The Right Stuff,\\" when there were test pilots who didn't worry about safety too much but just flew by the seat of their pants, you have astronauts here literally using duct tape and other household items to salvage their crippled space capsule and try to get home. I think there is a certain irony that 35 years later we still haven't gone back to the moon, getting the space shuttle up and running is constantly fraught with problems and delays, and now the Chinese, Europeans, Russians, and average millionaire American seems more capable of getting people or equipment up into space than NASA. I think if this Apollo mission took place today, those crew members would probably be doomed. Which makes this film all the more appealing.<br /><br />The entire cast is excellent. The music score beautifully compliments the action. Although beyond the launch there isn't a great deal of physical action, this film is as suspenseful and dramatic as any Alfred Hitchcock film. It is gripping and also inspirational as routine household items (including, quite literally, that duct tape) do get used to cobble together a way to salvage the crippled ship, conserve the remaining oxygen, and power supply (which was barely enough to run a modern day kitchen appliance), and figure a way to get them into the proper orbit to get back into Earth's atmosphere without either being incinerated or bouncing off it and out into space on a one way trajectory into infinity.<br /><br />The effects, particularly the launch, are impressive and realistic and give the feeling they're using real film footage, ie. they don't look like effects. You also feel like you're there. Everything looks very realistic.<br /><br />It seems to me that the film unfairly got a bad rap at the time it was originally released merely because Ron Howard made it. Even if you are not a big space buff, which I'm not although I did like \\"The Right Stuff\\" very much, \\"Apollo 13\\" is quite entertaining and exciting once it quite literally gets off the ground. It is a little bit of a slow start as characters get introduced and the mission takes shape, but from the moment one of the crew gets bumped from the flight because his medical reveals he has the measles, you begin to get a sense of foreboding of things to come and wonder how this change in crew will affect the mission. It proves to be quite significant.<br /><br />Despite all the drama, there is some witty dialogue from time to time to relieve some of the tension. But above all, the movie shows a positive \\"can do\\" quality and optimistic attitude often missing in today's America and NASA despite all our present-day superior technology. Viewed from this perspective, \\"Apollo 13\\" the film and the mission are that much more powerful and emotional to watch and I couldn't help but feel a little bit of nostalgia for those earlier days in the American space program.e buff, which I'm not although I did like \\"The Right Stuff\\" very much, \\"Apollo 13\\" is quite entertaining and exciting once it quite literally gets off the ground.
