B0001ZX0PG|1.0|I missed this film twice in the cinema and only got around to watching it on DVD after all these months. Since word of mouth and the reviews had tooted this murder-mystery drama vehicle as Clint Eastwood's best thing since \\"Unforgiven\\" and with a cast to die for, Mystic River seemed like the kind of film that I would actually prepare my day around watching. Mystic River was not only a major disappointment but begs to ask questions about how this film got such acclaim? Was it on the bases of the book's following? Is this a case of what looks good on the page not translating to the screen? No it is more than just that - the acting is a way Over The Top (wait for Sean Penn to start crying out for his daughter in a crowd of officers) and at times appears as if the actors and actresses are aware of the camera (wait until the last scene to see this at its most distracting). Okay so we could live with a little OTT, but not only is the story really overacted but it is just plain bad and is terribly, terribly, slow (and this is coming from someone who watches Tarkovsky - no problem). So when I say slow I mean S-L-O-W is a sort of Steve McQueen \\"Bullet\\" sort of way where things are almost done in real time and nothing happens for up to ten minutes on end. People in the room fell asleep while watching this. Yes Eastwood manages to give us one of these long five minute shots where people sit around talking about grief - then in the next scene does exactly the same again! We where waiting maybe one hour and twenty minutes after the murder for something to happen, and it does, but it is just pointless at that moment because you don't care and just want to get this soppy completely dull viewing over and done with and Eastwood put back in the old folks home as soon as possible. Mystic River is a low-budget direct to DVD release that has someone managed to get itself `stars' and put itself on the silver screen. Without the stars the story is JUNK, television network quality screenwriting. It seems that a domino effect may have occurred with all the actors signing on one after the other like lemmings.<br />The story, which I tried hard to avoid to read about(and wish I didn't) seems complex on the outside but is thoroughly hollow with some extraordinary scenes that totally break any realism that the film tries to employ. I would recommend Penn movie \\"The Pledge\\" or even \\"Sleepers\\" over this one any day of the week.<br />Sean Penn plays Jimmy Markum, an ex-con with a family, Annabeth (Laura Linney who turns up for about four small scenes), a daughter who winds up dead in the side of the road battered to death with a bullet in her head, a detective, Kevin Bacon playing Sean Devine, who is hot on the case with Laurence Fishburne, Whitey Powers. Tim Robbins, playing Dave Boyle, comes home one night with blood all over him and a strange story about possibly killing a mugger. His wife Celeste, Marcia Harden, believes that Dave may have murdered Jimmy's girl. Tom Guiry plays Brendan Harris, son of a criminal who was connected to Jimmy and who wants to run away with Jimmy's daughter and to leave his deaf and dumb brother and friend behind. Jimmy, Sean and Dave used to grow up together in the neighbourhood but Dave was abducted and abused when he was younger.<br />Sounds good right? Yeah this sounds like the makings of a really good crime drama, but it is all fake with the central plot revolving around Dave and Celeste's marriage breaking up and Celeste telling Jimmy what she 'thinks' she knows. So you can guess where this probably all goes in the end, but it is pointless because it is just so dull, lifeless and ultimately this movie GOES NOWHERE with an ending that is sprung from the pages of how to write a clich&eacute;d script. It is all bad bar the acting, but even at times the big names fail to bring us anything engaging by possibly trying to be too smart about something that wasn't.<br />Bottom line in this thing is that it is a disappointment anddrawn out slowly over a very thin plot with cornflakes box characters.<br />Avoid and pretend that you never saw the REAL Mystic River that you heard about. Even Stir of Echoes is miles better than this thing!wn out slowly over a very thin plot with cornflakes box characters. <br />Avoid and pretend that you never saw the REAL Mystic River that you heard about.

B000002HJR|5.0|Perfect album. About an hour of complete bliss. Does not get any better than this. SUPERGROUP from New Orleans. Pepper Keenan of COC, Bower of EHG and Clearlight, Kirk and Strange of Crowbar, and of course, Anselmo. Kick ass album. Some mellow stuff and its heavy too, Pick it up, man. This CD rocks.
B0001MDP3G|4.0|It was an unbearably hot day in the Pacific Northwest (89 degrees), too hot to be outside, but a perfect day for watching a movie, and what better movie to watch than Cold Mountain with its sweeping snow scenes.  And, by the way, it is a pretty good flick at that. <br />Set near the end of the Civil War, the movie captures the human drama and the enormous lost that the south experienced as a result of that war. They were simply devastated- a whole generation of men killed, woman who had to live the rest of their lives as widows or unmarried, the economic depravation and the horrendous lost of lives as demonstrated by the bodies of the war dead stacked up like cord wood.  It was sobering to watch.  Yet, through this tale of war, separation and death, comes a message of hope.  It demonstrates the triumph of the human spirit in the face of overwhelming obstacles.  <br />The casting was superb.  Jude Law- what can one say, but that he is an exceptional actor.  No, he is not a superhero with six-pack abs and a steroid induced body, but an ordinary guy, caught up in extraordinary circumstances, who by sheer determination and luck manages to survive where others die.  What can I say about the ending?  Having not read the book, I do not know the original story line, but I was just a little disappointed.  I just saw it coming.  All in all, it was a great way to cool off on a hot summer evening.
0743243307|3.0|This is a book with a lot of interesting details, but unfortunately is little more than colourful bric-a-brac lacking sufficient contextual integration to make the narrative an engaging read. <br />Ali's prose style is effective and tidy, and she  addresses an important issue about what the point of education is beyond collecting certificates and degrees with respect to Chanu, who becomes embittered because his intellect has such little value. This is a major concern with all ethnic minorities that regard education - in broad terms- as a ticket to better living.<br />This book is okay, but does not merit the publishers overly indulgent hype.
0671027344|1.0|With RARE exceptions, at least in my opinion, teen-angst books never work when they aren't written by TRULY angst-filled YOUNG people. TPOBAW just didn't work for me at all; it just seemed too contrived and poseur-like for me, and I'm not even counting all the cliches .... a big thank you to the reviewer who recommended \\"Little New York B#stard\\" by Dylan Raskin - now THAT is a book written by an actual twenty-something that has more angst in it than every single one of these cookie cutter teenage lit books put together (it's also the same book that Audrey Seiler, the girl who faked her own disappearance, is claiming provoked her to pull her disappearing act) .... Go read that and forget these Music Television poseurs.
B00007L4OM|3.0|Essentially it's a story about a man (Jean Reno) called Hubert. He has no life other than his cop life. He has a tendency to proceed about investigations in a rather violent manner (he actually punches anyone, good guy or bad guy, who gets in the way or interupts him). The chief puts him on leave for 2 months for his violent behavious. Then he gets a phone call from a lawyer telling him that his lover, Miko, has died. The whole movie is about the mystery Miko leaves after her death. Along the way, he manages to find out that he has actually fathered a Japanese daughter (with Miko) called Yumi. <br />This movie can be 'analysing material', but not as itself. This is because Jean Reno has this history of playing men who have fighting and shooting as their job description, e.g. The Cleaner in Luc Besson's Nikita; The Professional. So Jean Reno actually brings his screen experiences on board the show. Unless you happen to be watching him act for the first time, it is quite hard to detach yourself from his film pressence. <br />The French and Japanese mix is interesting enough. But Japanese culture is not really presented realistically here. Sure, the surface materialistic youth culture carries across, but no more than this. Yumi's plaintive cries for her papa are touching, but shallow. She also cries a whole lot.<br />The dialogue is witty. The camera angles are nice, especially when Yumi sticks her legs up in the lawyer's office. It's a great movie, not too intense, enjoyable, funny, action packed. Would I buy the DVD? Probably not. I do not think it bears rewatching.

They SOMEHOW ended up in the laundry hamper and almost knocked it over!  I had to stop the movie for I was laughing my socks off.  You know that look a cat gets when he knows he's done something wrong?  Well, they BOTH had that look!  Amazing!
B00006IM9Q|5.0|It's undeniable that Blondie has to be one of the best band out there(diggin' many musical styles and territories a fine example to groups like NO DOUBT), her last single GOOD BOYS represents the band at their best if you haven't heard it.  So without a question this new compilation includes all their charted hits and some exclusive favorites, it would be out of place to describe each song because the titles of the songs speak for themselves, HEART OF GLASS, ATOMIC, CALL ME, ONE WAY OR ANOTHER all classic songs of the late 70's early 80's, this is one of the best compilations of Blondie around today, + include here is their hit MARIA, not available in another GH package...so delightful Blondie will always be Blondie...a must have.

B00003CWTI|5.0|This movie is a must see for anyone who appreciates artistic well thought out movies. If you are dumb then I don't recommend it as you will be unable to comprehend it's brilliance, most of the time these people will dimiss it with negative reviews just because they don't get it.<BR>.... And I quote Bob Dylan ' Don't criticize what you can't understand'<BR>A unique film run with fantastic acting and an undercurrent of genius. The music, Starring Aimee Man's Beautiful voice captures the atmosphere of the movie with insane accuracy as does the superb camera work. Well Done!
B000063DGC|5.0|Ozzy Osbourne Randy Rhoads Tribute is the best live recording I have ever heard. Recorded mostly in 1981, Tribute shows Randy Rhoads' stunning abilities in a live setting. Randy plays and in most cases improves the original studio tunes. Songs like I Don't Know and Crazy Train have even more drive and interesting fills than the studio versions. Suicide Solution features a two minute unaccompanied solo spot that will stun any listener with it's speed and virtuosity. There is a beautiful version of Goodbye To Romance and Randy even plays three Sabbath songs. He manages to update these Sabbath tunes with interesting fills and with more virtuosity than the originals.<BR> Randy is brilliant throughout this recording, but he gets plenty of help from Rudy Sarzo on bass, Tommy Aldrige on drums, and of course Ozzy on vocals. Ozzy sounds great on this album, which really helps Randy to shine.  <BR> The 2002 remastered version has a few extra nice pictures of Randy and the sound quality is excellent!!<BR> If anyone does not have this metal masterpiece, please do yourself the favor of picking it up! You won't be disappointed!

B00005JKNF|5.0|Take an 'idea' by Bob Balaban and Robert Altman, transform that idea into a screenplay by Julian Fellowes, place Robert Altman in the director's chair, and gather many of the finest actors in England (and the USA), photograph it with Andrew Dunn as cinematographer, and assign the musical score to Patrick Doyle and presto! - out comes a bubbling movie that entertains on every level and makes a lot of statements about class distinction and other prejudices as well.  GOSFORD PARK is a gem of a film and only grows better with repeated viewings.<br /><br />Gosford Park is the estate owned by grumpy William McCordle (Michael Gambon) who has a way of distancing most everyone he encounters, his bored wife Sylvia (Kristen Scott Thomas), his frumpy daughter Isobel (Camilla Rutherford), and served by a staff of servants who include the very in control Mrs. Wilson (Helen Mirren), the butler Jennings (Alan Bates), and the head of the kitchen Mrs. Croft (Eileen Atkins).  A weekend hunting party is underway and as the guests arrive the dichotomy between the wealthy and the serving class is emphasized. Among the odd assortment of guests (each with a pack of secrets and prejudices) are Maggie Smith, Tom Hollander, Charles Dance, Bob Balaban, Jeremy Northam, James Wilby, and their valets and servants Clive Owen, Kelly Macdonald, Ryan Phillippe, etc.  The servants are incorporated into the staff rooms by the strange Emily Watson, Derek Jacobi, Jeremy Swift et al. The arrival evening drops a few hints of problems afoot both among the guests and among the servants.  The hunting party is scarred by a minor accident, but the real problem occurs at the dinner following the hunting party - a time when some of the occult problems become more obvious and culminate in the murder of the vile William McCordle.  The police are called and Inspector Thompson (Stephen Fry) uncovers some strange evidence that leads to not only the events of the murder but also unveils many of the secrets of both guests and servants.  There is a surprise ending that somehow makes all of the characters seem more human than their artificial roles they have assumed.<br /><br />This is a banquet of fine acting and ensemble work and adds such treasures as a series of songs performed by Jeremy Northam with great style as well as unexpected cameos by a large number of lesser-known actors.  It is a fine mystery, Altman style, and is as frothy and refreshing as fine champagne!  Grady Harp, April 08ervants.

B000001FRY|4.0|I have been a long time listener of U2. They were the first band I got into really seriously when I was a teenager. Hopefully, because of this, I can help you decide whether or not to purchase Boy.<br />Most musicians and bands start off with an album of songs which either are relatively bad or very hit and miss. U2's first album Boy, while not their best, is extremely solid for a debut. If U2 had never released another album, this would still be worth owning. <br />That being said, I'll get my criticism over with right off the bat: this album as a whole can be tough to warm up to. Each song hits you with a really cool guitar riff, and some of the songs are just completely phenomenal.  However, other songs can seem to drag on if you're not patient with the music. When I was young, I would often skip parts because I was thirsting to hear the next exciting guitar part and chorus. You could say that the pacing is a bit off sometimes. While this may sound like a harsh criticism, it's the ONLY big criticism I have.<br />Conceptually, this album is very good. From what I make of it, it's basically about growing up. Hence the title! The lyrics, while not mind-blowing, are very well done. They're vague enough so that almost anyone who listens can associate their own growing-up experiences with what's being said. Bono's delivery is excellent, leaving you with certain powerful lines echoing in your head. <br />Now, I am sure there are a few people out there who will never warm up to this album as a whole work. If you like anything else by U2, though, you ought to at least love &quot;I Will Follow&quot;, &quot;Out of Control and &quot;A Day Without Me&quot;. I promise that if you like other U2 albums, you'll at least find a few real good songs here. That's the most sinister thing about U2: No matter what people think about each album as a whole, there's never an album without at least a few really really great songs that make the album worth getting. For my part, I also thinkthat &quot;Shadows and Tall Trees&quot; could have been a hit single under the right circumstances.<br />Basically, if you own some U2 and like what you have, you won't go wrong with Boy. If you're a newcomer to U2, you'll probably still like the album if you're a fan of guitar rock. It's from 1980, it's U2's first album and it's still good regardless of U2's stardom.
014028009X|5.0|I've read &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary&quot; three times now, and it seems to get better each time. Why? Helen Fielding has crafted a funny, light-hearted comedy.<br />Bridget Jones is a young thirty-something &quot;singleton&quot; living in London. On January 1, she makes a list of resolutions to stick to throughout the year. Each diary entry begins with her weight, calories consumed, and other funny tidbits, like number of 1471 calls (the British equivalent of *69), Valentines received, etc. She often includes comments alongside these running totals to help the reader understand how she feels about each.<br />Throughout the novel, readers will share Bridget's pain as she struggles through a relationship with her boss, the breakup of her parents' marriage, a job change, and other less-serious events. Helen Fielding's descriptions of Bridget's psyche are hilarious, and many passages will have you laughing out loud.<br />Is this a classic on par with works by Charles Dickens or Charlotte Bronte? Of course not. However, this book provides a pleasant read, a way to escape your troubles by delving into Bridget's. After all, compared with her life, mine doesn't seem too bad.
B0000A1HQP|5.0|...it's that funny! And yet, as mobby_uk observed, there is a poignancy underneath it all.  Some are put off by the premise, a dinner that is a competition to see who can bring the most ridiculous guest.  Don't be.  It's an ugly idea but a deeply humane movie.  Jacques Villeret's portrayal of Franois Pignon is side-splittingly wonderful, hilarious and touching.  And writer/director Francis Verber, who also had a hand in writing La Cage aux Folles, is an international treasure.
B000089RVX|5.0|Although Evanescence has been, blindly, compared to artists such as Avril Lavigne, and Linkin Park, it would be wrong to categorize them in this way, so as to make what &quot;Fallen&quot; really sounds like seem illegitimate. <BR>     You have to wonder why Evanescence has sold over 5 million copies of their album, and won two grammies, after the album has only been out for a little over a year, if they are what some people refer to as &quot;wannabes&quot;. <BR>      &quot;Fallen&quot;, is, in short, an album for an artist of any age that craves what the music business has for so long been lacking in. What is this you ask? This, my review reading friends, is quality. This is what Evanescence has that so many artists do not. <BR>      This quality is illustrated in the meloncholic tunes from 1 through 11 (which is all the way through, unless you happen to have the enhanced version, in which case, the quality would be illustrated from tracks 1 through 12). <BR>      So, yes, now that I have said that they are extremely talented, you would probably like to know how a song or two actually sounds. Well, I think that I should first point out the fifth track, &quot;Haunted&quot;. <BR>     &quot;Haunted&quot; is a track that will indeed leave you feeling as the title says, and, to add to that, entranced. The combination of synth and crunching guitars and bass, as well as the beeping at the beginning and end will have your heart racing, and images flying through your head at such a speed that you, yourself, whether creative or not, will be envisioning beautiful dark fantastical things that you will not soon forget.<BR>      The next track I feel I must mention is the last, which is entitled &quot;Whisper&quot;. <BR>      &quot;Whisper&quot; is lyrically heartbreaking, and musically genius. Amy Lee's vocals are not only powerful, but fragile at the same time, and will most likely send chills up your spine near the end. The end of the song is a nearly perfect album wrap-up, and will leave you at the edge of whatever seat you happen to be sitting on. <BR>      In conclusion, &quot;Fallen&quot; can be described as the following:  poetic, beautiful, heavy, dark, inspiring, and well worth the measly 15 bucks , or less, that you have to pay for it. <BR>   My advice? Go out, buy the album, and listen carefully. You'll thank me in the future.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Okay, soooo many of you 1 star reviewers are missing the point.  Take it from a film student: there is more to real films than just &quot;harrowing scenes&quot; as one reviewer put it, and drama.  Go to the theater for great dialogue.  When did film turn into a way of making it easier to see plays?  You have a camera, USE IT.  And thats what Sofia Coppola did.  completely apart from the wonderful acting from both the leads and the minimalist storyline (which DOES have a point if you aren't too thick to get it) the visuals in this film are great.  Almost every still could be used as a photo, the cinematography is brilliant throughout.  I'm not saying its wildly entertaining and grip your seat suspense, but it doesn't have to be to be a well made piece of film.  Its like a great student film, but spanned over a much longer time period.  And for some of us (who know about films) thats a good thing.  so its not for everyone, that doesn't make it bad.  You 1 star reviewers try and make a better film.  and good luck to you.

B00006LLOG|5.0|What kind of scene might the world of avant gard music if not for the wonderful inventions of Lou Reed and Velvet Underground. Lou Reed knows how to craft a pop song with the best of them and and inject his persona thus making it quite unique.<BR>This was the album which positioned the rest of his solo career. David Bowie true enough did not write one of these songs but did his best to put onto tape the way he heard these songs in his head by acting as producer over the project. Mick Ronson (guitarist in the Spiders from Mars) also helps in molding the soundscapes which make this album a one of a kind. The thin white dukes thoughtful overtures often go misconstrued in the many albums he's helmed production duties on. I'm not sure if the album was remixed or not but for those who remember, Iggy Pop and Stooges 'Raw Power' had this kind of treatment in a re release some years back. Iggy opted to reduce the treble and increase the bass and percussion instead.<BR>Lou at this time was struggling to find his solo voice and wanted something different from what he was used to putting forward with Velvet. His finest songs are found on this incredible album...Walk on the wild side, Satellites of love and perfect day just to rattle of a few. Whether Bowie's contributions have held some lasting impact on the albums resonance some 30 years after being released is questionable. It certainly doesnt hurt in my opinion. Good place to start for those just now investigating Lou's reputable catalogue.
B0001DI0FI|1.0|I wanted so bad to like this movie, but unfortunately I could not. This movie almost put me to sleep, oh it's true. I had a hard time understanding the dialog so I was forced to use the english subtitles. There's almost zero action in this movie and even the one battle scene was weak. Too much talking and playing violins.(hee haw!) Very, very boring movie. I'm sorry guys but this one sucks bad... Real Bad!....... Can you dig it?
B000089RVR|3.0|I remember hearing &quot;White Flag&quot; for the first time, and thinking, oh please, if I hear this song one more time, i'm going to cut my ears off lol.  I heard the song, but I wasn't &quot;listening&quot; and taking it in.  Well, I thought I hated the song, then I started singing along with it, and I was like WOW, this is a tough song to sing, but her voice is really soft and deep and different.  So of course this song became like my favorite song, then I seen the video, and was like wow, she just looks plain and all, but she's very pretty, and I thought wow, I should buy &quot;Life For Rent&quot;, and I did.<br />It takes me awhile to get used to a cd, so I listen to it at night in my headphones when I go to sleep, which it's the perfect cd to do that too, I'm not saying it's boring, it's just soothing and nice.  My favorite track is &quot;White Flag&quot; of course, but I do skip it a lot so I dont get sick of it, they still play it on the radio a lot.  I love the &quot;extended&quot; beginning on the cd though, you don't hear that on the radio.  My other favorites are, &quot;Who Makes You Feel&quot; and &quot;Sand In My Shoes&quot;  I love the chorus on that one.  There is something about &quot;Mary's In India&quot; that grabs my attention, it keeps your attention to really listen to the lyrics.  I like the chorus of &quot;Life For Rent&quot;, and &quot;Don't Leave Home&quot;.  The Bonus track is nice too<BR>&quot;This Land Is My Land&quot;, is probably my least favorite, and the other songs are &quot;ok&quot;.  All and all it is a pleasant album to listen to, Dido's voice is very soothing.  I do wish she would of recorded a few &quot;upbeat&quot; songs.  I don't own &quot;No Angel&quot;, but I am going to buy that soon.<br />I give LIFE FOR RENT 3.5 stars out of 5.
0767805712|5.0|The word &quot;Inspiring&quot; is grossly overused in film reviews. Gattaca is one of the very few that genuinely deserves it. In a nutshell, it's the story of a mutt (Ethan Hawke) bypassing and surpassing a world that's designed against him. This movie really affected me (another overused appraisal.)<br />Maybe I just love this movie because I relate too much to the protaganist, Vincent. Despite everyones expectations, from my high school counseler on, and my lack of any prestigious schooling, I'll soon have my physics PhD.<br />This is a wonderful movie. That it didnt sweep the Oscars only validates the movies point.
B00005JM02|3.0|I'm never too old for movies that appeal to the young. Though I'm not a huge fan of Pixar, I thought \\"Toy Story 2\\" was amazing in every way. I saw the preview of \\"Finding Nemo\\" in the theater. I was amazed, and was anticipating what seemed like was going to be a very good film, the best Disney/Pixar movie to be released. It seemed like it was going to be a huge contribution to the world of animation. To my dismay, it was very disappointing when I watched it. Pixar has the ability to achieve the best visuals in the movie industry. The technical achievements put into \\"Finding Nemo\\" surpass anything they've done previously. However, the visuals cannot hide the same old Disney aftertaste that's provided in the movie's material.<br /><br />I'm tired of people calling \\"Finding Nemo\\" a great movie, because it is not. It gets way more hype and rave than it really deserves. It was very predictable and overly reliable on cutesiness and stereotypes, and it was yet another Disney/Pixar movie whose plotline was a rescue mission wrapped in sentimentality. It's a sad thing when technology has reached its apex, but overdone formulas remain. Disney has been churning out tedious, pedestrian, pixie-stick drab for a while now. Their movies tend to always play it safe and comfortable; they never seem to reach out for something different. \\"Finding Nemo\\" continues that tradition. Why can't Disney, a world-known cultural icon, push their own boundaries further?<br /><br />A big aspect for creating movies for children is humor. Unfortunately, the humor in \\"Finding Nemo\\" felt contrived and slapstick. Compared to Pixar's previous works, this one was disappointingly flat. Can Pixar do better than have a side companion plagued with memory loss? Can Pixar do better than to give characters social stereotypes? (ie: the surf turtles, scary girl with braces) \\"Finding Nemo\\" lacks the situational humor, the smart cultural references, and the smart quirky antics that other animated films have, even some older Disney movies such as \\"The Emperor's New Groove\\". Some people have graduated from the cutesy humor approach long ago. Remember: there is a big difference in bringing out the child in someone as opposed to just presenting someone childish stuff.<br /><br />It's depressing to see a mundane film like \\"Finding Nemo\\" receive all the rave and attention while other amazing animated movies, such as Hayao Miyazaki's masterpiece \\"Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi\\" aka \\"Spirited Away\\", are left to be overshadowed by the public. Now that movie is an example of how a children's movie should be. A great children's movie should be able to trigger a child's senses, emotions, and imagination. It should not just rely on old tricks: being cute and visually enticing so it could sell.y movies such as \\"The Emperor's New Groove\\".

I'm not writing this review to beat you over the head with my bible, but this movie was not a \\"cool bloodfest\\" as other individuals so inconsiderately stated  If you can watch this movie and NOT feel anything more than a \\"cool\\" sensation brought on by the blood and violence, then you are missing the ENTIRE point of the film and should reconsider watching it with a more open mind.  I believe it is much more than just an ordinary film (although, yes, it is a movie), it is a powerful depiction of the last 12 hours of Jesus' life on earth.  Was it a little too violent?  Well, that would be something better left in your hands to decide.  The movie is as violent as it needs to be.  However, younger individuals (maybe some older) may find some of the images disturbing.  All I can recommend is to use discretion when viewing.  If you have not see the film, though, I would strongly suggest (as well as the other millions of people who witnessed  and were touched by the film) to buy it or even just rent it!

B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is the best album out there! Brtieny is an amzing performer who makes amazing music. She has the looks and the moves despite a not so good voice. But 2 out of 3 isnt so bad. Anyways this album is the best album that i have and i have a whole bunch of cds ranging from Kanye west to Switchfoot to Christina Aguilera. And this cd is the best!! I love it! People bad mouthing on this cd has either never heard it or theyre jsut jealous cause Brintey's famous and better lookin than them. And People that give it one star are stupid Pink floyd fans and they should go to hell. Anywho this cd has the whole package. good songs, goo production good vocals, good lyrics and a nice cover. IT has awesome songs like Boom Boom, Breathe on me, Toxic, Outrageous and Everytime. the only song that i dont like and really hate is Early mornin which annoys me to death. And thats the only song that i skip. I love Britney also because shes so versatile unlike some of her fellow pop singers like Jessica Simpson who sticks to only sappy love ballads. Britney is going to be in this business for a lonnnnngggg time and soo she'll be the next MADONNA. I can almost feel it. Get this album right now if u don't already have it because it'll blow your mind.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|I think the song &quot;I've Seen It All&quot; is one of the great classics in music.  I struggle with the urge to weep every time I hear it because it is so moving.
055357342X|5.0|I read all three of the books in the series and loved them but there is nothing that I can say that hasn't already been said about them. Just wanted to add my 5 stars.
B000002UAU|5.0|To put it colloquially, I usually think hype is retarded.<BR>But the Beatles, as with U2, Michael Jackson and a precious few others who are constantly exalted, deserve every bit of it...if not more.<BR>I knew I loved the Beatles before I first listened to my father's pristine vinyl copy of this album...Little did I know that it would send me into such a bout of musical ecstasy, that my entire life would be marked with a beautiful, impressionistic and unending set of mystical 'streaks'.<br />Now, get beyond the pretentious-yet-sincere remarks I just made and let me tell you; this is an album in and of itself; done completely right in that its creative visions hit you over the head with their virtuosity.<br />Silliness, innocence, nonsense, mysticism and surrealness may seem like a lot of words, but they are only a few of the perfect emotions the music is allowed to transport to you.<br />I laughed, cried, etc etc, but was entranced the whole way, from the carefree opener, to George Harrison's oasis of Majestic Eastern bliss, to the witty, yet disturbingly descending cacophany of the final song.<br />Even the dorky cuteness of &quot;When I'm Sixty-Four&quot; has a place.<BR>And &quot;Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds&quot; has got to be among my favourite songs. Though, it is important to note, was not actually about LSD...well...that's another story ;)<br />But all I can say, is that the orchestration and quirky/otherworldly overall instrumental and songwriting approch will leave you with an impression at once desolate, angelic, and hopeful.<br />Give this a chance, from start to finish, and find yourself dazed, and enriched.
B00005O438|5.0|This film can be quite disturbing and hard to watch. If you do not like seeing very young 5-year old children suffering and crying their eyes out and screaming you may not like this. Ok, so most of the film at the beginning drags a bit, but it introduces you to the characters and it deeps down into their lives. But once Cujo kills his first victim the real scary stuff begins to happen.<br />The film is about a dog named &quot;Cujo&quot;, who gets bitten by a rabid bat while he is chasing a rabbit. We then move to a family: mom (Donna), dad (Vic) and their son (Tad) and we look at their lifestyles and problems. We then go back to Cujo, who is beginning to get very dirty and hiding in many places away from his owner in their farm. Cujo soon transforms into the monster he becomes after the rabid bite and kills the owner. Then, Donna and Tad are driving along the road, when their car suddenly stops in the middle of Cujo's far. No one is in sight, until Cujo suddenly appears. Donna and Tad are forced to stay in the car, so Cujo can't kill them. <br />Whenever Cujo tries to attack the car it can be quite disturbing and frightening. There are also lots of jumpy moments and un-predictable ones. I would only watch this if you are a hardcore horror movie fan, or a Stephen King fan. But there are some really shocking scenes which could be too much for others.

B00028HBKM|5.0|Just recently I took my wife to the movie and will always remember the images for the rest of our lives.<br />As an evangelical Christian, I would like to briefly address the advance negative media before the movie's release.  Concerning o the negative media hype, we did not come out of the theater with a sense of hatred for Jews, Romans, or anyone else.  Quite the contrary - my wife was moved to tears several times, and while I did not cry, I certainly gained an even greater appreciation of what Jesus Christ did for us!<br />Yes, the movie did contain some of the Hollywood creativity you see in movies based on actual stories (did Jesus really stomp on a snake in the Garden of Gethsemane, and some other instances), but the movie was faithful to the biblical account of Jesus' death for the sins of the world and the Hollywood creativity  did not detract from the film's essence.  The film's setting (I think it was filmed somewhere in Europe) and atmosphere were also very powerful.<br />While some people have problems with the movie's violent content (some people left the theater early when we went), Jesus' death was extremely violent.  Since Jerry Springer can let skeletons come out family closets and Hollywood can produce movies full of illicit sex, foul language, and mind-numbing violence, then why should a portrayal of the crucifixion be sanitized? The viewer's emotions are aroused and the person is challenged to really think about what he or she believes in terms of Jesus Christ and His claims. In short, the movie accomplishes what it sets out to do and is much more than just mere Hollywood entertainment.<br />The only complaint I have with the movie is the emphasis on the crucifixion and not enough on the resurrection.  Of course, if Mel Gibson produces a sequel on Christ from the resurrection to His ascension, then this complaint is irrelevant (and I hope so too).<br />For the Christian:  see the movie or buy or rent the dvd and be encouraged that you have a present and future hope in Jesus Christ!<br />For the non-Christian:  expect to be aroused emotionally and  challenged intellectually about what you believe concerning  Jesus Christ and Who He said He was and is!ent and future hope in Jesus Christ!<br />For the non-Christian:  expect to be aroused emotionally and  challenged intellectually about what you believe concerning  Jesus Christ and Who He said He was and is!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Following up a smash hit debut album is possibly harder than getting that first magical recording contract in the first place - the artist oftentimes feels he/she must outdo himself/herself, and fans oftentimes resist any deviation from what has come before.  Many young artists crash and burn, never to be heard from again.  Avril Lavigne is not among those, and with this really quite incredible sophomore release she cements her place in the present and future of the music industry.  While there are echoes of Let Go to be found here, I found this to be a surprisingly different album from its predecessor - the artist has grown as a person, a musician, and a song writer, and the expanding life experiences of this remarkably talented teenager have infused her music with a palpable sense of something quite real and deep that speaks volumes to the listener.  <br />I have been listening to this album constantly since it came out (and I might mention Avril Lavigne is one of the few artists whose new album I simply had to purchase as soon as it was released), and I can't find a bad song on here.  Not only is this a five-star album, it is a collection of twelve five-star songs, in my opinion.  I have a sentimental attachment to many of the songs from Let Go, but as a whole this new album is a much more impressive offering.  Avril co-wrote each of these songs, and as far as I'm concerned, the doubts some voice about her song-writing abilities are quite misplaced.  The first single, Don't Tell Me, is a great song and in some ways it forms a natural bridge from the first album to the second, but it is far from the best song on the album.  Take Me Away starts Under My Skin off with a bang; there's no gradual immersion into this new album, as Avril reaches out and yanks you by the collar from the very start.  Then comes Together, which I love; teen angst fuels the fire of this song, and the manner in which Avril delivers the chorus of this song really appeals to me.  He Wasn't isa fantastic song of independence and self-worth; its up-tempo delivery has a Green Day feel to it, and the song itself is all about not settling for anything less than the best.<br />How Does It Feel is the only track that didn't win me over immediately, and at first I wasn't sure there was really much to this song; over time, though, I have come to appreciate and love its comparatively simple style and delivery.  In this song as well as the album's final track, Avril seems to step away from the bold and brash persona she carries so well to reveal a little bit of her soul.  My Happy Ending has hit single written all over it; this song of dreams unfulfilled sweeps a vast panorama of the singer's soul, as she moves back and forth between regret at what has been lost and inspiring defiance at the wrong that has been done.  This theme is reinforced by Nobody's Home, the subject of which lacks such inner strength, and Fall to Pieces sort of falls under the same broad theme.  I think Forgotten might be my favorite song on the album, as it gives us Avril at her most fiery and determined - when she says she won't be forgotten again, she really means it.  <br />If you're looking for strong shades of Let Go, I think you'll want to direct your attention to Who Knows and Freak Out; these are tracks of great energy and pace, speaking ably to Avril's amazing mesh of inner strength, confidence, and vulnerability.  Slipped Away closes the album out quite impressively.  Dedicated to the memory of Avril's grandfather, Slipped Away is a moving tribute to a loved one who has been lost.<br />And there you have it: twelve great songs on one very impressive album.  Let no one doubt that Avril Lavigne will be a forceful and innovative force in music for some time to come.
B000002J1M|3.0|Because alot of reviews said this is the best Genesis album ever recorded, I decided to pick it up together with Nursery Cryme.<br />I am really lucky that I played the latter first, because otherwise I would never have listened a Genesis album again. The number of memorable melodies can be counted on one hand. The only 2 songs that I can really listen a couple of times in a row are horizon's and time table.<br />The epic supper's ready suffers from the same thing. Eachtime there is beautiful instrumental work, and than Gabriel starts to sing his lyrics, and suddenly the track isn't fun anymore.<br />The Hacket showcase horizon really saves this album for me.
B00028HBKM|1.0|The people who flock to this film scare me most of all. They find it amusing and exciting to pay to watch a person be persecuted and tortured to death. Disgusting. In any decent human the reaction to a person being tortured in such a way for they sake of yourself should be to cry out \\"Stop! I am not worth your suffering.\\" However, millions come in droves and enjoy every second. These same people who claim to follow a person who so blindly loves other people regardless of themselves spend the rest of their time wanting to supress and persecute others for their beliefs. Unbelievable. <br />This is NOT Jesus' legacy. none of it.
1577311523|4.0|I consider myself a devout athiest and was not expecting much more than another &quot;live in the moment&quot; book, when a friend recommended The Power of Now.  Being a perfectly content person already, I didn't think it would have much to offer me.  In fact it gave me a lot to think about.  Tolle makes a lot of very insightful observations about how the human mind works and the frustration we create for ourselves.  He loses me whenever he starts talking about Being and how we're all connected to everything, but that doesn't get in the way of understanding the rest.  He loses a star for too often using a weak metaphore as though it were evidence of his point.  Although I'm not sure that he was really trying to prove his point, rather just trying to explain how he sees the world and let the readers decide for themselves.  Either way, a very worthwhile read.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|For those who said this album was a disappointment... you are not a Slipknot fan. This is a great album! It features guitar solos by Mick Thompson, who is a great guitarist and never showed it until now; drum solos by Joey Jordison.. metal drummer of the year, not a surprise. With a new look comes new(great) music. The only song I didn't really like was The Virus of Life, it was kind of weird but the rest was unbelivably awesome. You don't need to be a heavy metal fan to like this cd, or have even liked Slipknot in the past... even my mother likes this cd. Personally, I love Slipknot and own all of their albums and loved them, this one being no exception. I reccomend this album to anyone, no matter what style of music you listen to.
B0001MDP3G|3.0|What can I say? This movie was excellent up until the ending, which ruined for me and a lot of friends and aquaintances I talked with concerning it...  Right from the get go, it had me!  I felt the acting, cinematography and everything was outstanding, even the story.  I will keep this short, because the movie doesn't deserve much after it's horrid ending, which totally destroys the entire story.  The ending is kind of like ripping the frame (foundation) out of a house, while thinking it won't crumble!  Definitely worth seeing, but just once; if you like sad and boring (over done and cliche) endings you'll love it...

1592400876|5.0|Just the other day I finished Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves - The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation by Lynne Truss.  You can draw one of two conclusions from this.  Either I'm getting really serious about my writing, or I've gone over the edge and started reading books on arcane points of grammer and writing.  I'd like to think it's the first of the two options, with a bent toward reading some really funny stuff!<br />Lynne Truss is English, and has written a book that took many by surprise.  Ranked #5 on Amazon at this time, and it's a book on punctuation?  Hey, where else can you get writing like this:<br />&quot;As we shall shortly see, the comma has so many jobs as a 'separator' (punctuation marks are traditionally either 'separators' or 'terminators') that it tears about on the hillside of language, endlessly organising words into sensible groups and making them stay put: sorting and dividing; circulating and herding; and of course darting off with a peremptory 'woof' to round up any wayward subordinate clause that makes a futile bolt for semantic freedom.  Commas, if you don't whistle at them to calm down, are unstoppably enthusiastic at this job.&quot;<br />As a writer, I at least try to pay attention to punctuation.  As a reader, you're more influenced by punctuation than you probably realize.  Truss covers the history of words and such with dry English wit and humor, making sure you learn dispite yourself.  After finishing this book, you should have a much better grasp of what little symbol goes where, and when you should use a comma vs. a semi-colon vs. a colon.  It's almost worth reading just for the quality of writing, regardless of whether the subject matter appeals to you.<br />The only problem with reading a book like this...  Now that it's known I've read the book, you can watch my writing and see whether I've learned anything.  :-)
B000148KK2|5.0|Was not much of a fan of Diana's last two studio efforts, but this one is just brilliant.  Beautifully touching, and honest,  original, enjoyable, and multi-layered; basically all things I look for in a solid record.  Instrumentally cleaver arrangements and eloquent solos, plus a superb choice of covers make this one addictive.  Can't wait for more Krall/ Costello work.
0446677450|3.0|I bought this book primarily because of the tagline - What the rich teach their kids etc. The notion of a secret society out there is always appealing, and finding out the secrets... Well<br />Naturally, since rich people are not actually a secret society, but only people who have money, I was disappointed. The book does not tell you the secrets and it cannot. I was also very much annoyed by the book, and therefore - here is a summary, which is probably more accurate than the back cover of what this book contains.<br />The things I liked:<BR>- The book tells the getting rich story of the author, the path he took and where it got him. The story is told well, is inspiring, and the dramatization is adequate<BR>- The book provides a decent reference for actual content, telling you which subjects to learn and pursue in order to increase your chances of becoming rich. <BR>- The book is effective in convincing you that becoming rich is possible, and the authot is honest enough to admit that it takes time and that it is not easy.<br />The things I disliked:<BR>- The book is repetetive. It appears as though the author did not have enough meat for a whole book, so he just hit the repeat button, instead of adding some meat to it. Or else, the author believes that by repeating statements they assume greater validity. Anyway, it's rather annoying.<BR>- The book is lacking in actual content. After listing several topics that you should learn (marketing, accounting, etc.), I'd expect the author to at least provide primers on these subjects. However, he only recommends other books.<br />Most importantly, and here's a WARNING, the book pushes you to get rich for all the wrong reasons. The subtext of every other sentence is that being an employee sucks, that everyone (the rich, the government) is using and abusing you on a regular basis. That you are (assuming most readers, like most people are employees), in a nutshell - a sucker. This is intended to get you to do something about it, to get you to say - no more! This is a way to suggest that you should become the abuser instead of the abused. <br />I resent that. Being an employee is a viable life choice, that has its benefits as well as its shortcomings (even if it didn't work out for the author's real father). The same is true for being self-employed and an investor. <br />I believe that if Coca-Cola wants to motivate me to buy Cokes it should show that Coke is a good product, not that Pepsi is a bad one. And yet, there isn't a single sentence in the book that suggests that the author's life is any better now that he's rich. The fact that the rich kids didn't want to play with him when he was a child because he was poor, and that he felt like an outcast, is not solved and cannot be solved by having lots of money. The fact that he does not think highly of his real father, like most people do, because he wasn't financially savvy, is not changed by having lots of money.<br />I refuse to motivate myself by calling myself a sucker. I dislike the idea of someone manipulating people's frustration in order to sell books. It is a well-established fact that one of the things that separate successful people from others is their ability to motivate themselves. Motivating yourself by saying: I will no longer be a sucker, is a loser's motivation, not a successful person's motivation. Motivating yourself by saying: One day I will sail in my yacht into the ocean, and so forth - is the winner's way. Follow your dreams, and let them show you the way, not your frustration.<br />I will do what I can to become rich, but if I don't - so be it. Your life can be great with or without loads of money, and it can be horrible with or without loads of money.

B0001UL7RY|4.0|UNDER MY SKIN is the sophomore effort by &quot;bad girl&quot; Avril Lavigne.  While the music is still very much pop, the lyrics have more meaning to them and explore deeper into life.  Avril left the boys of The Matrix and combined with Evan Taubenfeid, Chantal Kreviazuk, Ben Moody (Evanscence), Raine Maida, and Butch Walker to create her new voice and it shows in the tracks.  While not as many radio friendly tunes as the debut, the album supports enough tracks to make a fine stay on the charts.  Some of my personal favorites are as follows:<br />&quot;Together&quot;  the tale of a couple who no longer feel they are connecting to one another.<br />&quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;  the first single.  The tale of a girl standing up for herself when a guy puts her down for not &quot;giving it up&quot; right away.<br />&quot;My Happy Ending&quot;  the second single and the best track on the album.  This tells of a romance gone bad and should remain on the charts throughout the summer.<br />&quot;Nobody's Home&quot; is the song with Ben Moody.  It is the tale of a woman trying to find her way, but cannot.<br />&quot;Slipped Away&quot; is the song dedicated to her grandfather, who recently passed.  Very nice tribute to someone she obviously cared very deeply for.<br />I highly recommend Avril's album, but if you are looking for a repeat of her first album, you will be disappointed.
B000067JG3|5.0|I grew up with this video and watched it on TV every year.  The songs have always stuck in my head.  I even did the Sound of Music Tour when I was in Austria.  But now I've got my daughter introduced to this beautiful music.  This and the Wizard of Oz are her favorites. <br /> I bought the easy piano scores for her to play the songs on the piano, and singing lessons on CD &quot;Voice Lessons TO GO&quot;, by Vaccarino (They're great and a lot cheaper than private voice lessons!)  for her, (even though I use them when she's at school).  So she is confident to sing along while she plays her Edelweis and Do a Dear.  We love it.

B00005JN0A|1.0|My God, this movie was lame!  The whole premise of the film is so unbelievable it's rediculous.  A few of the jokes are mildly amusing, but not enough to actually laugh just smirk.  Most of them, however, are just plain stupid.  Granted, Michelle Trachtenberg looks incredible in a bikini &amp; evening gown, and there are plenty of topless women to keep the depraved entertained.  But if you're looking for actual enjoyable humor, a plot that makes sense, or something even remotely resembling intelligent film work, then this is definitely not the film for you.
B000002KIE|5.0|Pay what little it costs to buy this, play it loud, and enjoy.<br />If it doesn't make you feel charged and asking yourself what you've been missing, there might be something wrong with your stereo. If you fall asleep, have someone check your vital signs, you might actually be dead.<br />Pete Townshend, an original punk, dedicated his album Empty Glass (1980) to his daughters and the Sex Pistols. Had the Sex Pistols stayed together, they may have opened for the Who when they toured in '82 instead of the Clash.<br />This music is more defiant than any display (clothing, haircut, accesory) considered punk, and is the yard stick by which all of that genres music is to be measured. The Pistols never branched out musically, changed their outfits, etc. They were so punk that they disbanded after having played thier biggest show (Winterland, San Francisco), just a couple years after forming, and like real punk, burned out instead of rusting.<br />Every song on this is a gas. Holidays in the Sun, God Save the Queen, Bodies, Anarchy in the U.K., EMI, No Feelings, Problems, and New York are pure brilliance. What the Pistols did, and when they did it, showed more balls than someone burning an inverted crucifix on stage, or burning a flag or a picture of the pope.  God SAve the Queen, in response to the silver jubilee couldn't have been more unpopular a statement at the time, and is a good reminder for anyone jumping on a band wagon for something so pointless.<br />Beat on the brat that thinks this is overrated, cuz they got rocks in their head.<br />The only thing the Pistols did wrong was not fire Malcom McLaren after he brougt Sid Vicious on board, instead of someone not a junkie that could play their instrument, and maybe they'd have made another record, although not likely as good as this. This is the best punk record ever made, as an original of something generally is.  Good punk is not deep, like the Clash (and I've worn out their first 3 records) and not monotonous (like the Ramones). God bless the Ramones, but the Gabba Gabba hey and holes in the jeans got old, and Johnny Ramone is an ultra republican (not very punk that)While your ordering this, see if you can get \\"the great rock and roll swindle\\" on dvd or whatever format available. You'll see there was a sense of humor to all this as well.bless the Ramones, but the Gabba Gabba hey and holes in the jeans got old, and Johnny Ramone is an ultra republican (not very punk that)While your ordering this, see if you can get \\"the great rock and roll swindle\\" on dvd or whatever format available.

B00006GO99|5.0|Of the dozen or so Monk albums in my collection this album positions itself as one of my top three favorites - with a large margin of endearment. Not unlike other albums released by Monk in the late '50's and beyond, herein Monk spreads out his pieces with lengthy solos and rythmic toying. New renditions of earlier concieved works are laid down with double or more playing time; not something that I find more oft to be a positive attribute.<br />However, this album is an exception. The essence of these works is not lost during the expanses of soloing and the melodies live beyond the confines of the jewel case. This is the kind of music that you just can't get out of your head and will actually enjoy humming when the CD ain't around. Also noteworthy, sound quality is vastly improved over early recordings of Monk.<br />If you don't own The Best of the Blue Note Years, it is highly recommended that you purchase both albums. For glimpses of the mad genius, try the video Straight, No Chaser.
B0001ZX0OW|1.0|Sean Penn as Jimmy in this film should be totured forever for the killing of an innocent person. BUT he didnt, he was a free man. THIS is BS, justice should make him pay. Jimmy is a church-aholic man, so I supposed Jesus Chirst taught people to lie and deceive and stab an innocent person and shot him, what a great religion, no wonder we have so many killing and death in this world. Disagree? let's see, which countries started the most recent international war and kept saying God bless them. <br />This Jimmy guy (Sean Penn) thinks he is something by wearing leather jacket and gloves, eat my S@@t, I will beat this guy up and toture him if I ever see this kind of injustice in life.<br />Jimmy lost a hore daughter, so what. She deserves every beating of it. HAHA, love to see how she got beatened to death and how Jimmy was crying like a baby when he saw the body. I did felt sorry for Jimmy up until the point where he ganged up Dave, and I was very wrong.<br />This Celeste wife of Dave, what a traitor, she should be shot to death for her lies. She was way too weak emotionally.  <br />And finally Sean, he knew Jimmy just murdered innocent Dave and he didnt do anything, NOT fair! He was a FBI agent, which the film suggested was very corrupted internally. Look at what FBI are up to recently on the headlines: cracked down music/movie piracy. Hello! Dont they have much more important murder cases to solve? I wish I can toture that baby girl of Sean so he can know how painful it feels to lost someone. That poor kid of Dave lost a father, forever! Gee Jimmy lost a daughter and he still had 2 others and Jimmy could always stick that things of his to his hore wife and get another one. That poor kid will never have a father ever!<br />All in all, very bad movie plots, it is like saying if u kill someone u can get away with it.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Christian, Jew, Muslim, Buddhist, Satanist, black, white, Latino, gay, straight...people of these and all other groups should have seen this film. It was one of the most moving and beautiful films I have ever seen. Is it graphic? Yes. Very. Is it over-the-top? Yes. Is it inspirational? To some. Is it sad? Extremely.<br />The violence in this movie was not mindless and without a purpose, such as every horror film ever made. The violence in this movie, and believe me, it was abundant, serves the purpose of showing what Jesus suffered for the human race. I myself am an Atheist, I have lost my faith. I didn't walk into this film expecting to strengthen the little faith I had left or to throw me back full force into Catholicism. I saw this just to see what a single man would go through to save the people who, 2,000-somewhat years after his death and rebirth, barely believe in him anymore. Nowadays, there is precious little faith and hope to hold onto. What with the president we have in the White House, screwing the country over to serve his fathers agenda, but thats besides the point. Jesus did all this, being brutally beaten an inch from death, carrying a huge cross after that, only to be crucified for the people who know don't even acknowledge his existence.<br />This film is powerful on many different levels. Emotional, physical, psychological. Emotions ran high for me, personally. From the moment they began to beat him to the moment the crucifixion was over, I could not stop crying. An extremely touching moment was when Jesus, played incredibly by Jim Caviezel, falls while holding the cross and Mary, his mother for those that didn't know, sees him on the ground, helplessly weak and being spat upon by the crowd and remembers a time when he was younger and he hurt himself and she runs to help him. Only this time, she knows she can't save him or stop the crowd. When that swell of John Debney's orchestral and choral fury kicks in, the tears went streaming down my face and there was nothing I could do to stop them.<br />The movie was an amazing emotional roller coaster. There are a lot of really tough guys where I live and they told me they all cried like babies watching a man being beaten like an animal and then stand up again, prepared to take it all over again to show that he was truly the Son of God.<br />This movie gets five stars from me, for its power, its emotion, its sense of craft, its sense of love, the beautiful cinematography by Caleb Deschanel, the amazing score by John Debney, the top of their game performances of the cast, and the direction of Mel Gibson, who took a major chance on this and knew in his heart that the Passion of Christ was nothing pretty. It was shocking, it was graphic, it was bloody, and it packed an emotional punch.
0452284392|5.0|This is an excellent book. The author is extremely able to explain difficult concepts about complex systems in a simple and precise manner, using examples from a variety of domains. The richness of applications -- ranging from spread of epidemics to the internet-- is the first strength of the book and of the theory of scale free networks that appear to be a very promising and original tool to understand the web of interactions of complex systems. The second strength is the clarity of writing: a rarity in the scientific world. This book is an example of good writing with the objective of being understood and making science accessible.

B00008PW2D|5.0|I really like Sex in the City. I feel sad that no one has even TRIED to duplicate it--I know full duplication can't be done but since it's leaving I would even have settled for some decent knockoffs of the show (laughter). In no other show/film have sex and relationships from the point of view of women been explored this frankly--it will probably never happen again-at least not in my lifetime. I am in the middle of watching the fifth season. I'm enjoying it. We have all watched these four women for four years now. Are they supposed to remain unchanged in any way for that long? Shouldn't they have different changes and challenges in their lives? I will admit that the fifth season did not come as close to perfection as the others did. (Has your work been almost perfect consistently everyday in everyway 365 days a year for 4 straight years? Mine hasn't-it's called being human.) Season Four in my opinion is still an essential for anyone who really connects with this one-of-kind series. Being that I respect the brave work of this ground-breaking show and because this format is supposed to review the material and the work--(...) Also don't you find it amazing the things people put their passion and rage behind? Homeless mothers who need health care for their children express this level of passionate anger about overpriced prescription drugs-however a person ranting about the cost of a HBO sitcom on DVD-and going on and on like some of these people have here?? I tend to wave that off as \\"You have some serious issues and buying SATC is probably the least of your problems\\" Some reviews can be dismissed right away like the ones from misogynists who obviously just hate to see independent women having fun and enjoying sex/relationships/career in the free-wheeling way men always have. They secretly want all women to be like Afghan women were under the Taliban. (...). (...)  <br />We can be so hard on celebs. We love them yet we hate then and we are ultra critical of them. Lastly, I again want to remind you, dear reader, to consider the source and look up any info you can find on a reviewer and weigh that against whatever they write. Also take totally anonymous reviews with a big grain of salt. And again...I enjoyed the fourth season of Sex In The City even with it imperfections!
B0002234LS|2.0|This movie is worth renting but not buying, and even then renting it for a dollar, maybe. The movie has weak character development excePt for Depp's character. You would think that by now no one would dare do a remake of the Shinning or Fight Club,but guess again. This movie combines both, not in a good way.  I have to admit the only thing that kept me from turning it off was Depp's ability to play a great character. For all of you Depp lovers, his performance is great but its like watching a Captain sink with his ship. OVERALL CRAPPY MOVIE
B000084T18|1.0|What the hell are people doing saying hes the next 2pac. I bet if 2 pac was still alive he would have already shot 50cent's head off. This is just some dork that MTV found and said hey lets lie and say u got shot 9 times and then start saying ur like 2pac and that way all these gay little rich kids will say hey this guys gangsta and go buy ur CD. Well i herd this cd and i went out side and smasehed it with a sledge hammer. Peop[le who are real and know what good music is stay far away from this piece of crap.
B00005RDRO|5.0|This movie has you guessing the whole time! The jokes are very funny, I would reccomend this to anyone who likes stupid humor defenetly worthit.
B0001IN080|5.0|What a wonderful CD and DVD package.  Excellent work with excellent production.  You can not go wrong with this latest addition to a Buble' collection
0783225903|2.0|This movie is really disappointing and boring.
B000148KK2|1.0|first, everyone has a right to an opinion..ok people..now i have known diana for a very long time, since childhood, and i have followed her career as well..and i can tell you, she is in love and love is blind in more ways than one! this album is NOT Diana, it's Elvis...sorry diana, but this album was painful..i feel bad for her, because i know it meant alot to her to write these songs..i was very excited to buy this album, as i was so pumped to hear Departure Bay because I grew up there too, but I could only relate to the Arbutus trees..so dissapointing..the song i wanted to hear the most was the hardest to listen to..zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz..thats how the whole album made me feel..but i think diana will comeback to reality now..she's hardly ever had a negative review in her life, until now, so maybe she will listen instead of being offended..i kind of doubt she'll care what anyone else thinks though, that's just what she's like..and people that call her boring..well..she is a bit of a boring person to be honest! she's not exciting, and she doesnt try to be.. and sometimes it comes out in her music..but she's still a great artist and i hope she does better next time
B000065VA1|5.0|I really didnt want to like this album...it kind of reeked slightly of mainstream, but I just could'nt help myself. I just love this record. It really delivers from start to finish and still gives me chills at times because its just so good.
0743243307|3.0|This book is ok but it didn't wrap me up like some books do.  I really had to slog through it.  It is about a Bangladesh womans adjustment of moving from childhood in Bangladesh to being a married wife in England.  Very good book about an imigrant trying to adapt to a new lifestyle.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|God people...What is with the constant talk of Muse being blatant ripoffs of Radiohead. This had pissed me off somewhat. It is plainly obvious that some of you people out their just listen to Matthew Bellamy's voice and go, \\"Gay! sounds exactly like Thom Yorke.\\"..Get your ears checked...What? Both their voices can go really high in perfect pitch...WOW!!! While i am also a huge Radiohead fan i dont hate Muse because the singer has a voice that can do some things similar to Thom Yorke, and because Radiohead started making music first. How do you people feel about the Punk or Rap music scenes? If you wanna bag out music that sounds the same, go review some Snoop Dogg, or Blink 182.     Absolution is a masterpiece, from chunky metal to orchestral epics, it has it all! The Cd starts out fantastically and quickly moves into greatness, with the arrival of the singles, Time is Running Out and Sing for Absolution and then goes all heavy on you with Stockholm Syndrome. After a bit of a calm down we are forced in Hysteria, a song of blinding power. After 2 fantastic epics we move into another rockier song, The Small Print. After some more calming down we move into Thoughts of a Dying Atheist and then we close the Cd with a beautiful track.    Muses best?? I think so. The amazing orchestral scores on this Cd do it for me.

B00005T30L|4.0|I never would have known this movie existed if it wasn't for my sister who insisted I watch it. This is a good movie, but to be honest it's not something I would want to watch again just because it's a bit bland and slow for my taste.<br />It's about Enid (Birch) and Rebecca (Johansen), two girls who just graduated and have little direction in life. Rebecca is a bit more stable, opting to get a job and find an apartment of her own. Enid on the other hand finds joy in drawing random people's pictures, &quot;torturing&quot; the guy who works at the convenient store, and befriending a strange, older man called Seymour (Buscemi) who doesn't really like anything, just like her. They find solace in each other.<br />It's a strange film and chugs along at it's own pace, showing us only what we need to make up our minds about their own little world. The film does have it's moments and is in fact wonderfully written. Check this one out if you haven't and find out what you think about this one because honestly, you have to see this one for yourself.
B00006RU5B|5.0|After 15 years of purchasing CD's the collection has built up quiet nicely, however apart from the \\"Best Of\\" CD's you normally stock up on at Christmas this is the only CD I would ever play start to finish without hitting skip. The band could have easly based four albums on this one if they took the usual approach and threw some \\"filler\\" into each album.    When I read the hype on Velvet Revolver one would think that the so-called \\"Supergroup\\" battle would heat up but I doubt that will happen in the short-term anyway. Audioslave trounces Velvet Revolver in terms quality, production, music and importantly the song writing where VR falls down heavily.    I have played this CD to the brink and it would appear that I need to go out and purchase another copy. I feel obliged to pay $20 for it rather than rip it off from somewhere, because that minor $20 has made the last year at least more enjoyable. Who really needs to be rich or famous when you throw this CD in on a long drive where during every listen to come to appreciate the absolute talent this band displays?    The song list has been reviewed heavily already however more recently Like A Stone and Getaway Car where the two I tended to repeat after hearing the CD all the way through.    The sales from this one will never do Audioslave justice. If this was from a new group without any great expectation it probably would have moved 10 million copies +. Sure it didn't change the world like \\"Nevermind\\" did and will not be ever mentioned in the same league but blow me down Audioslave is actually a much better album musically and lyrically at least.   Commerford is underrated to the extreme but he really carries this one before Morello launches into his trademark solos. Finally we have a very intelligent, well spoken and talented player who doesn't need to be drugged out to play well. The DVD illustrates clearly these are real people and Audioslave was more than an effort to simply support expensive lifestyles and/or drughabits. Many would say well it is the music that counts and who would even bother looking deeper. Well Audioslave delivers musically, whilst I now use The Vines first CD as a coaster. I have no time anymore for bands that disregard fans and feel they are well above those who pay their wages  .  Absolute genius end of story. Chris, Tom, Tim, and Brad should be applauded for such an outstanding effort that I doubt will ever be topped. (Who knows maybe Audioslaves second CD will outsell this one regardless).    There are two tips in this review. One will cost around $20, the other around 7c per share.
0618526412|3.0|I usually don't post reviews, but I felt compelled to speak up about this particular work. Given all the negative reviews - some of which characterizing this as the &quot;work book ever&quot; - you may be tempted to pass this one by. Don't.<br />Literary masterpiece? I don't know about that, as few works really live up to that title. And this book *is* challenging to read, and it *is* depressing. But those two criteria are not an argument for not reading a book. <br />I found this book, above all else, to be very real and very moving. The style is at times opressive, but also at times a bit charming. I've not read anything else quite like it, and I'm very glad that I spent the time on it.<br />You may be too, and at the very least, this is one book worth making your own judgement about.
B000021XS0|5.0|If, by definition, Progressive means stretching the envelope of musicianship, playing songs that go in new directions with great skill and precision, then DT hit the mark square in the middle with this recording.<br />I admit to being late in the game, coming to this Cd just in the past month... but my favorite Prog bands have always been Flower Kings, Glass Hammer and legendary groups like Yes, King Crimson and Frank Zappa/Kansas... but this group, this Cd really establishes a new classic, much in the same way Yes did with Close to the Edge.<br />The musicians in this band, could I feel, been a part of Zappa's band if he was alive, they are THAT good.<br />No, I am not over stating this Cd.  It is that good.  It is full of majestic power and excellent skill in songwriting and imagery.<br />If you can appriciate progressive music, in any sense of the word, in any broad definition that the word itself suggests, then this Cd will make you smile, and the smile should last a long time.
B00006SFLV|5.0|My So Called Life is an excellent t.v. drama. Starring Claire Danes and Jared Leto.  The best episodes have to be The Substitute, Halloween and So-Called Angels. The acting is so great when you watch it you can feel what they're going through.  You can watch this drama over and over again and you will never get bored you will just get into it more and more. In otherwords if you haven't already bought it you're missing out on real good t.v. unlike what's out there at the moment.  You shouldn't be dissapointed!!
B00008EY65|5.0|All in all it was very a great flick . It was alot better than I thought it would be . It was funny , suspensefull & it has some musshey parts . The guy who played Hellboy did a great job because you cant help but like him he is a tough guy with a sense of humor , he is Wolverine with alot less of an attitude . I guess that there is someone for everyone in this world . They seemed to surround Hellboy with a pretty decent cast of characters . The only villian I thought was cheesey was the sword flinging Natzi . At first I thought he was impressive the you see him out of costume and its like alrighty . Oh yes also  the blond hot Natzi , she had to be at least 100 years old damm she looked good.
0312955006|3.0|Harry Bosch, William Connelly's sleuth, renegade dectective, is on trial for his \\"murder\\" of a suspect in the Doll Case murder. Bosch shot and killed the suspect as he reached for his toupe, and his widow wants retribution through litigation. Suddenly, as the trial progresses, another Doll Case-like murder is uncovered, but the Doll Case suspect is supposedly already dead. How can the murderer be dead if the cases continue to arise?<br />The novel is heavily laced with court proceedings about the widow's revenge, Harry's love affair with the widow of the man he kills in \\"The Black Echo,\\" and Harry's conviction that the Hollywood police have a copycat murderer (instead of not having caught the right guy the first time).<br />These two subplots, and primary plot, should have made this one of the better novels, and according to the reviews, most readers liked the latticed effect. I thought it too divisionary. The subplots are necessary, but could have been severely cut to keep the main story in focus. This criticism aside, I liked the novel, but it is the least favorite of mine after reading four of Connelly's other Bosch novels..<br />\\"Black Ice\\" is recommended before reading the \\"Concrete Blonde.\\"
038073186X|1.0|This is called a good read? I call it a rip off! Have you ever seen the Sixth sense? Granted it not a total copy but the concept is the same! If you are a thinker you will have figured this book out half way through! Don't waste your time, effort or money!
0446613444|4.0|&quot;Black Ice&quot; begins with the discovery of a dead cop in a motel room that appears to be suicide, and ends with a revelation (uncovered by Harry Bosch) that the cop's death was  murder. However, Harry is the only one to believe in the cop's murder until events unfold to prove him correct, and the suspects are hard to come by.<br />This is typically well-written, fully-developed, and articulate Harry Bosch, only William Connelly's second novel (after &quot;The Black Echo&quot;). The plot is very well constructed, with revelations evenly paced throughout. The characters are more than placecards to hold their positions for the novel to unfold. Bosch proves himself the rebel of custom and protocol as he ventures through several states and countries.<br />Readers familiar with the Bosch cycle of novels will not want to miss this one. Readers new to Bosch are advised to read &quot;The Black Ice&quot; first.
B00004R99J|5.0|I just watched it again after awhile while goin down memory lane... and was looking it up on the computer and read all these comments on how its is so wrong and not correct.... but its disney... its not supposed to be right and thought out.... i mean animals cant talk like in alot of disney movies.... u know... really this is one of the most realistic disney movies.... and very touching... made me cry.... but... u know its disney... dont think it out and how that never happened jsut enjoy the story
B000001EUN|4.0|&quot;This was a very hard C.D. to find. But finally found it to replace the tape of the same name that was lost. I grew up in the &quot;80's&quot;,&amp; when a friend played one song called,&quot;The Zoo&quot;,I really loved that song right away,&amp; then listening to the rest,which back then I didnt know who they were at 15, I loved this record!!! There are some songs from the C.D. that werent my fav's, but enough to have to have it again. Make it real,Dont make no promises your body cant keep,Falling in Love,Only a man,The Zoo,Lady Starlight,I love  those the most,they are really good &quot;HEAVY METAL MUSIC&quot;,the other 3 are not bad at all,(Hold me tight,20th century man,Animal Magnetism,are also good,but everyone has their fav's. There are 9 tracks,&amp; if Ive been looking for this, this long,then I think its worth every penny.The Scorpions do an excellent job ,the music is hard rocking metal as they are,the songs are unique,and I really love this C.D.,&amp; Iam glad I finally found a copy. If you like &quot;80's&quot; HARD ROCK,then The Scorpions,&quot;Animal Magnetism&quot;,wont be a disappointment!!!!
B00003CXWV|4.0|I rated this movie 5 stars, until I got a load of the DVD extras.  These extras actually serve to drag down the enjoyment of the movie.  First, there are the &quot;character outtakes&quot; whatever that term is supposed to mean.  These consist of various characters being interviewed about George Jung - the character, not the real person.  They say poorly thought out and inarticulate things like, &quot;This guy... he's like... this guy don't care what anybody thinks, you know?&quot;  My impression was that the actors just got in front of a camera &quot;in character&quot; and extemporized.  The results are pretty ghastly.  Also, there is the jailhouse interview that director Ted Demme makes of George Jung, the real person.  This is also pretty disedifying, consisting at the end of Demme sitting next to Jung on a bench and saying similarly inarticulate and poorly thought out things, like, &quot;Yeah, its like schoolteachers make minimum wage and there's truckdrivers making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year...&quot;  Now, I am an ex-schoolteacher and though I did not make a mint at my job I certainly did not make &quot;minimum wage&quot; and I worked for one of the most underfunded school districts in the country.  One has the impression of being a witness to a guy blowing his mouth off on the balcony of somebody's post-college get-together.  Not pretty.  How Demme ever got people to trust him with millions of dollars remains a mystery: the man is simply not preposessing intellectually.  Also, his world is morally vague and equivocal.  He tells Jung he takes a non-judgemental stance to his crimes and then says that he himself has skeletons in the closet, its just that his are not so well known.  Now, I kind of doubt that Ted Demme is himself a serious criminal who has simply evaded discovery.  But that is what he is in effect implying, in bad faith to George Jung - a hardcore criminal.  The real implication is that any degree of malfeasance is equivalent to any other.  If one man has smuggled enormous quantities of drugs, and another man has left the cap off his toothpaste well, they're pretty much the same: we all do bad things.  Interestingly, the stance that Demme takes is NOT that what Jung did was not morally wrong.  His stance is that, though it was wrong, so what?  I can respect and perhaps agree with someone who says that smuggling drugs, though illegal, is not immoral.  I can understand the argument that by and large it is an utter liberal myth that anybody is forced to use drugs by anybody else.  Peer pressure?  One gravitates to &quot;peers&quot; with similar interests.  If you get into drugs and your friends don't, you find new friends:  druggie friends.  This happened in my circle of friends and I have seen it happen first-hand.  I had many druggie and non druggie friends and I never saw anybody use drugs who did not want to.  And there is simply no substance so addictive that it turns a straight arrow into a degenerate against the straight arrow's will and inclination.  Drugs simply help you along in the direction you are inclined.<br />All this being said, I can agree with someone who does not morally judge George Jung.  Personally I am morally indifferent to his actions.  But this is not the same thing as saying that what he did was wrong but so what we all do bad things.  If I once ignored a parking ticket, is this the same thing as being a murderer?  I suspect that Demme's thus cozying up to Jung actually lowered him in Jung's regard.her.

0553275976|4.0|The much-celebrated novel is a fairly unique one in the landscape of literature. Its 700+ pages and style are, as explicitly stated by Wolfe in the intro, an attempt to return to the grander realism works of the past. He specifically mentions Anna Karenina as the great example of the novel that portrays a cross section of a whole society. Only this is rarely done today, so what we have is one of the only major cross-sections of New York in the 80's.<br />However, this is a cross-section that is viciously sliced from the meaty flesh of New York society, leaving it gaping, bleeding and exposed, all in a highly satirical and humorous way. <br />The main story revolves around a high-powered broker and his mistress who are involved in a hit-and-run accident which leaves a young, black &quot;youth&quot; from the Bronx in a coma. The scandal sweeps the city as an epitomy of the racial, economic and cultural differences (and inequalities), as a mob builds up around the case. In terms of the actual plot, there's nothing complicated, rather, its the eye into the eschelons of high, middle and poor society New-York-style that makes this entertaining and enjoyable.<br />Wolfe exposes the massive slab of hypocrisy present in the society, from the DA who has idealistic tirades about his job (when it's really a vehicle for his extra-marital and political ambitions) to the British journalist who thumbs his nose down on all things American (while scurrying for his next free meal and alcoholic binge).<br />As mentioned by many reviewers, there's nothing essentially new in the book - as Wolfe said, some of it feels like it's been ripped from the headlines, but in reality much of it is art imitating life. What I liked about the book is its message of vanity and indulgence, and how quickly those superficial bubbles can be burst in a crisis to *make* a person &quot;ordinary&quot; again. True to an almost century-old tradition in books, there are no real heroes here. But still, despite allthe horrible things the main character has done, I found myself feeling sorry for him and somewhat admiring him by the end.<br />Other complaints have been the superficial role of women in the book, but again, I think that's simply an extension of the superficiality of a section of society that spends more on a painting frame than a cop earns in 6 months.<br />Overall, a great book that speaks without being preachy and has a lot of very funny moments.
0790729377|5.0|This is a perfect date movie.  It is intense, sexy, and packed with intellectual and emotional whallop.  The actors are interesting and beautiful to look at, and the subject matter is mature and provoacative.  It is the perfect setup for getting to know someone better, and a great warm-up for intimate activities to follow, or for super-intense action like you get when you put into practice the teachings of the \\"New Sex Now\\" dvd.  <br />God bless you Marlon, you were a true subtle hunk!
B0001WTUH6|5.0|If you're a fellow fan of Underworld, you'll probably have to own this just for completion's sake. And you won't be sorry: the added footage IS interesting. But if you're tight of wallet at the moment and can't reconcile re-buying a movie you just purchased on DVD a few months ago (the original), breathe easier knowing that at the end of the day, the original version is still better. (As is mentioned, this isn't a DIRECTOR'S cut, but an extended version--so you're getting footage that was edited out to simplify the plot and slim down the running time... Thus, you're getting an overly long movie that probably only a fan would dig. Borrow a copy from your monied friends.)<br />HOWEVER, this expensive package does have two wonderful things going for it: a hysterically funny commentary track featuring Wiseman, Beckinsale and Speedman, and an amusing outtakes featurette. So often commentary tracks can be dry and uninteresting, but these friends have such a good time rewatching this film you'll bust a gut laughing! I don't mean to give it too much of a build-up, but I was almost ill I laughed so hard. And, as always on any DVD, the &quot;bloopers&quot; reel is revealing and funny. You'll wish there were more of it.

B000000OAA|5.0|I'm in the minority here among Queen fans in that I don't really like Queen II all that much, but I find Sheer Heart Attack to be a huge improvement.  As with their debut album, the album is good and very consistent -- I can listen to it the entire way through without wanting to skip any tracks (although I do dislike &quot;She Makes Me&quot;).  A great Queen album, recommended.
B0000AFX64|3.0|This DVD is not in anamorphic format despite Amazon's claim to the contrary.  This is a widescreen LETTERBOX format only.  The video transfer appears to be the same as the previously released DVD.  In fact side one of this DVD is exactly the same as the previous DVD.  Side two contains the supplemental material.<br />I would not recommend the purchase of this DVD to anyone who already has the the previous DVD.
B000000OA6|5.0|When I first started listening to Queen, I liked a lot of their 70's material but not much of their 80's work.  But I loved this album from the first listen.  It is strong throughout, every track is good and yet each track is diverse (as with any other good Queen album -- how did they do it?).  If you're a fan of the 70's Queen, I recommend you give this album a try -- it doesn't sound like their older material, but it's a great album nonetheless.  I'd easily rank this in my top 3 favorite Queen albums.
B00013F38K|5.0|This set is really great, despite its shortcomings (which aren't really worth the attention that they are getting in these reviews).  Kung-Fu is one of the best television shows ever, and the show's lessons can teach us more now than ever before.  You'll be doing yourself a favor by buying this.<br />As a sidenote, I'd like to mention that although the framing is a bit questionable in a few quick shots, the widescreen works in the show's favor more than it doesn't.  This show doesn't feel like television anyway.  <br />I hope very much that they release the rest of the series, as I can't wait to have another all night marathon.
B000000OE7|5.0|&quot;Innuendo&quot; was the last album released by Queen before Freddie Mercury died, and it was a fitting final album for him.  &quot;Made In Heaven&quot; was released in 1995, 4 years after Freddie's death.  Of the 11 songs on the album, 5 were previously released in other forms: &quot;Made In Heaven&quot; and &quot;I Was Born To Love You&quot; were originally on Freddie's &quot;Mr. Bad Guy&quot; album, and are included here with those same vocal tracks, but with Queen's instrumentation; &quot;My Life Has Been Saved&quot; was a B-side to &quot;Scandal&quot; from &quot;The Miracle&quot;, but is slightly different here; &quot;Heaven For Everyone&quot; was originally recorded by Roger Taylor's band &quot;The Cross&quot;; and &quot;Too Much Love Can Kill You&quot; was previously released on Brian May's &quot;Back To The Light&quot; album (with Brian on vocals).  But even though not all of the material here is new, all of the material is very good, and it's a great album.  Not quite as good of an ending as &quot;Innuendo&quot;, but a very fine piece of work nonetheless.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|This final film in the Matrix trilogy left me with too many unanswered questions.  How can Neo physically influence the machines in the real world?  Exactly what happened with Neo and Smith at the culmination of their fight?  What will the relationship be between the humans and machines from now on?<br />Even if such issues were explained I would still have some gripes.  When Smith was possessing that human's body he didn't show enough signs of hurt from the damage done to it.  I would think an AI which isn't used to enduring physical discomfort would be overwhelmed by such painful sensations.  Also, I found the emotions of the human characters to be unconvincing.  Their reactions to the story's events didn't fill me with a sense of believability.<br />With that being said, I still enjoyed the movie, overall.  The action and visuals are what save this film from being mediocre.  The Zion assault scene is amazing.  Neo's climatic fight with Smith is less impressive but still pretty neat.  The Matrix Revolutions probably has the greatest effects of any movie thus far.<br />I rather liked the message the story conveyed at the end.  Faith is an underused yet heartening element in modern TV and cinema.<br />There's a bit of info in the special features that mentions why a new actor was used for the character of the Oracle.  The original died.  I'm glad they explained that because I thought the Oracle's change of appearance was illogical.<br />I think we'll all agree that the first movie deserved better.  The Matrix Revolutions will be known as the last chapter in a good trilogy that should've been great.
0780020685|5.0|This is juat an incredible film.  Upon learning that their village is going to be plundered, a community of peasants decides to try to enlist the help of some samurai to defend them.  With nothing to offer them but food, a couple of peasants go out in search of some &quot;hungry&quot; samurai.  The samurai that enlist each do so for their own reasons, but they all come together to defend the village from the raiders.  The characters, acting, and story all make this a fantastic film.  It clocks in at over 3 hours, but doesn't seem that long.  And even though it's all in Japanese and subtitled in english, you wont mind!  <br />One complaint however: this DVD will only play in one of my three DVD players (I have a Toshiba, a Sony, and a Memorex DVD-RW, and it only plays in the Sony).
B0001ADAVK|5.0|I could see why some people would and wouldn't like this movie. But for me, I absolutely loved it. It was inspiring, and wonderful, and yes, even though Kirsten Dunst's character was a bit confusing, I thought it was a very good movie overrall. You don't get to see many teachers try and change their students's life around. It's all about textbooks and following the directions to the exact point. But I thought Julia Roberts, was perfect for the role and she pulled it out perfectly. But with that being said, there were also some glitches. It was surprising that there was a lesbian in the film and that Kirsten Dunsts's character was so unkind to Julia Roberts and towards the last 10 minutes of it them being good friends! (they didn't even have any apologies just of them going on with their lives.) That could have been handled a bit better. But overall, I was happy with it. You should definitely rent it first rather then buy it. You should do that with any movie anyways.
B000000OAN|5.0|A lot of people are familiar with this one due to &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, but that's not the only good track to be found here!  Just about every song on this album is very good, and the different songwriting styles of the band members are represented here.  Queen is an &quot;album band&quot;, not a &quot;single band&quot; -- each song is very different than the next, but they all have something to offer. Great album.
B00000JKH2|5.0|They say that EP's are always good because it takes 4-7 of the band's best songs at the time and puts them out.  That is very true for this EP.  Released before their hit &quot;Relationship of Command,&quot; this EP captures 7 of At The Drive-In's best songs.  Every song is has it's own character it seems.  They don't sound too alike as other songs may.  If you are a first time ATDI buyer, this would be a definite good start.  It isn't as edgy and hard as &quot;Relationship,&quot; but not as &quot;emo&quot; as &quot;in/casino/out.&quot;  A definite way to be sure that you will like all of their music.  Surely, the best of thier material
B000000OAC|5.0|This one's a bit different in style from the earlier Queen albums, but still a great album.  &quot;Spread Your Wings&quot;, &quot;Fight From The Inside&quot;, and &quot;It's Late&quot; are standout tracks, and the rest of the album is very good as well.  After this album, Queen went a little downhill for me, but this is a very good album I'd recommend to fans or those new to Queen's music.
B0001VWP8I|5.0|I first heard Anastacia on MTV in Germany, and returned to the US to seek out her CD. <br />Her voice is fabulous.
B000000OAH|3.0|I very much enjoyed all of Queen's previous albums (with the exception of Queen II, and I'm in the minority in that opinion), but unfortunately I don't care too much for this one.  It has some high points (&quot;Don't Stop Me Now&quot;, &quot;Let Me Entertain You&quot;), but a lot of it isn't really my cup of tea.  Your results may vary.  To those new to Queen, I'd recommend &quot;A Night At The Opera&quot;, &quot;A Day At The Races&quot;, &quot;News Of The World&quot;, or any of the earlier Queen albums with the exception of Queen II (sorry).
B00003CXCT|1.0|These are not the originals, it's just another Lucas marketing gimmick and I'm surprised how many he has been able to squeeze out of these 3 movies over the years ( 4 that I can remember). What's even more unreal, is the publics willingness to shell out the money everytime Lucas wheels these films out in another new gimmick.<BR>Save your money....
B000000OAL|5.0|Queen's first album starts the band's catalog off on the right track.  Very good songs and very consistent -- it's an album I can play from beginning to end without wanting to skip a track.  I haven't actually sat down and rated all of their albums, but I'd guess that this would probably be in my top 5.  Recommended.
B000002H6C|5.0|Metallica does it again. Buy this one quick so you can hear songs like &quot;one&quot;, &quot;blackened&quot; and other astonishing songs! Buy it!
B00005JKHP|4.0|Star Trek: The Motion Picture was rushed into theaters without time to edit it, and as such, the picture CRAWLS at times.  This Director's Edition completes/adds some things that were storyboarded but unable to be accomplished at the time, and is also edited by director Robert Wise.  I admire the decision by the effects people to make the new effects look like they could have been accomplished in the late 70's (as opposed to modern CGI), and for the most part they succeeded.  As for the editing, this is also an improvement, but the initial V'Ger flyover sequence is still approximately 10 minutes long -- that's just way too long to have to sit and watch effects shots without dialog (there may be SOME dialog, but not much).  At any rate, I really enjoy the first half hour, but after that it's hit-and-miss.<br />As for the DVD itself, they did an excellent job.  There are lots of documentaries, trailers, and TV spots, as well as all of the footage that was deleted/trimmed from the film.  Well done.
B00000J2PH|5.0|If you remember listening to radio back in 1971 there was no way you wouldn't hear Carole King's beautiful &quot;It's Too Late&quot;. This album contains that hit plus other gems such as &quot;Smackwater Jack&quot;, &quot;I Feel The Earth Move&quot; (one of my all time favs), the beautiful ballad &quot;So Far Away&quot;, the song James Taylor made so popular &quot;You've Got A Friend&quot; and &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman&quot;. All classic songs! This edition of Tapestry also includes two unreleased songs &quot;Out In The Cold&quot; and &quot;Smackwater Jack&quot; (a live version). The entire cd is remastered and sounds great. Carole King was one cool and talented lady (she also wrote songs for The Monkees among others). If you like Joni Mitchell, Carly Simon, Linda Ronstadt then you'll love Carol King's classic &quot;Tapestry&quot;.
0451163516|5.0|Now, first of all, I would like to say that, although I haven't read &quot;a lot&quot; of books by Ken Follett, I have now read three.  And all three have been worth the time and worth the money.  For sure.  The Man from St. Petersburg is set mostly in England in the pre-WWII era.  The plot of the story is that Feliks, &quot;the man from st. petersburg&quot;, is planning to kill a Russian prince who is in the middle of treaty talks with England.  Feliks beleives that the murder of the prince will bring about a break in a possible alliance to Russia.  Throughout the story, many connections between Feliks and the English family housing the prince, are revieled, making the story very ironic, but I think the connections give a certain sense of suspense from wondering what might be revieled next.<BR>     Overall, it was a very gripping, suspensful, and entertaining book that had a very good bit of storytelling wrapped in.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|In a time when most studios bank on a combination of bubble gum pop, hip hop and rap to sell soundtracks for a film, we are gifted with true greatness.  Howard Shore looked at each film as a separate entity that required a continuous bridge as a theme, and different voices to carry each movie to the next.  You had Enya (May it Be) for Fellowship of the Ring.  For the Two Towers it was Sheila Chandra (Breath of Life), Isabel Bayrakdarian (Evenstar), Ben Del Maestro (Forth Eorlingas, and with Elizabeth Fraser on Isengard Unleashed) and Emiliana Torrini (Gollum's Song.)<br />On the final soundtrack, we get a host of voices to treasure.  We have the sublime in Renee Fleming (Twilight and Shadow, The End of All Things) and  Ben del Maestro (Minas Tirith).  We also have the flute of James Galway (The Black Gate Opens, The Grey Havens.) But what is most endearing is the voice of Billy Boyd (The Steward of Gondor)and Viggo Mortensen (The Return of the King) singing laments to mark their historical journeys.<br />Peter Jackson has created a gut wrenching, emotional trilogy.  Howard Shore has blessed us with music that grabs your heart and soul and never lets go.  I highly recommend all three magnificant sound tracks.
B00003CXCT|1.0|When the announcement was made that these \\"films\\" were being released on DVD, I'm sure geeks worldwide began growing.  However, I don't fall for the hype, and neither should you. These are not the original films, so why buy them. How much money does Lucas need? Just make sure he doesn't get anymore of yours.
B00005JLK1|2.0|I am continually amazed that multimillion dollar films that spend so much on decent actors and special effects, can't spend a little more time or money on more carefully considered screenwriting. As Shyamalan pointed out about making The Sixth Sense, you have to have rules that you follow throughout, or the viewers will feel unfairly manipulated. Do you pass right through the ghosts like they are holograms, or are they real enough to touch and feel or to manipulate and carry real objects? Make up your mind which one is true and follow that rule. Will all the souls be liberated if the ship sinks, or not? Are people killed off because they have allowed themselves to be manipulated into succumbing to one of their weaknesses (that would be clever), or can the ghosts just kill whoever they want anytime (much less clever)? It is a cheap trick to switch back and forth on these things, especially under the pretense of a \\"surprise ending.\\" <br />In short, what could have been a pretty good idea with equally good acting and effects, instead flounders in mediocrity because of cheap plot shortcuts. Average and watchable if you're a horror movie fan who can accept these faults, not worth it if you're not.

0671891634|1.0|This book, written in 1993, simultaneously comes at the end of Mr. Lynch's career in money management and the beginning of a long sprint in the broader stock market, largely fueled by tech/internet stocks.  In any period, one can expect 1 of 100 money managers to far outperform both his or her peers and the broader market by chance.  Mr. Lynch was that one money manager.<br />Mr. Lynch starts the book by turning investing into a game.  Although his method was subtle (using an example of grammar school kids picking stocks), the implications are profound.  Investing does share some resemblance to many games we play in life, and one of the Great Money Masters, the fictitious 'Adam Smith' readily admits this in his classic book on investment, The Money Game.<br />However, Mr. Lynch takes things one step beyond the game, and as the book's title hints, he turns all investment activities into a competition.  In so doing, he pits the small investor against the institutional Players, and as a result, sets up the naive reader to walk a well-trodden path littered with sorrow and the bones of many foolish investors.<br />Granted, 'Adam Smith' once said, &quot;The Players aren't smarter than you.  They just have more information&quot;, and there also is a certain level of truth to Lynch's assertion that the Little Guy can outperform the Big Boys.  However, Lynch fails to disclose one important and critical difference.<br />I believe it was Hemmingway who said, in response to Fitzgerald's observation that the rich were not like the ordinary schmuck, that &quot;Yes, I know.  They have more money.&quot;  Something frightfully similar can be said of the key difference between the  Little Guy and The Players, but with one critical insight: The Players do not merely have more money, they have a lot more of Other People's Money.  That in essence is the fundamental difference between The Players and the Little Guy, who must wager his (or her) own hard-won funds in order to play the Grand Game- the stock market.<br />Needless to say (but will be said anyway), the consequences of one's actions weigh heavily on one's shoulders when one's own money is at stake, but really aren't felt when Other People's Money is on the line.  The Players play with Other People's Money, but you, dear investor, play with your own hard-won earnings.  That said, the intelligent investor must ask herself, 'Do I really want to play with my money?'.<br />Beating the Street rests heavily on this undisclosed truism and a host of faulty assumptions.  The book really is a sales pitch to buy stocks and to participate as much as possible in stock mutual funds.  To that end, Mr. Lynch places before the reader a number of questionable arguments.  Here are just two:<br />First, perhaps the most flawed argument of the book is that the small investor, upon retirement, will spend more than she earns in investment income.  This is stated as a bona-fide fact when in reality, it is a generous assumption.  From this assumption, Mr. Lynch then argues that one should invest in stocks and use some portion of the capital appreciation in addition to the dividend income for the purpose of meeting one's spending needs.  He then fortifies his argument by citing inflation and emphasizing its ability to erode fixed income.<br />The facts are 1) how much investment income you will need is determined by how much you plan to spend, 2) many people choose to work either part-time or full-time after retirement (either out of necessity or desire), and thus have some supplemental income, 3) though the general historical trend for stock prices has been 'up', there is nothing that says that stocks have to go up, and finally 4) inflation can adversely affect stock prices (and have actually done so in the past).  Lynch invokes the inflation argument when trashing bonds, and abandons it when touting stocks, even though inflation acts on both.  Nor does his idealized comparison of stocks vs. bonds on pages 52-56 take into account taxes and transaction costs incidentally.<br />Second, on page 69, Mr. Lynch boldly says that, &quot;If you plan to to stick with a fund for several years, the 2-5 percent you paid to get in will prove insignificant&quot;.  This last statement may actually be worse than his first (of many) flawed arguments, for the following reason: the money lost to the load fails to compound at whatever investment rate of return, and over long periods of time, the difference between what you committed and what gets actually invested grows- and this is before we even consider the effect of annual expenses.<br />These and other flawed but superficial arguments for stock investing make for very difficult reading.  Apart from the gross argumentative errors, the book presents many of Mr. Lynch's reminiscences of a stock market long gone.  However, there are some useful hints in the book, most likely put there by Mr. Rothchild, but they are far outnumbered and over-shadowed by Mr. Lynch's deceptive pitch to buy stocks.
B0001ME5L2|5.0|wow! i really love this album. It is much edgier and - well - brattier than her first debut &quot;Let Go&quot;, but it's just as good as it (maybe even better!).

0375713751|5.0|Until I read this book, I never questioned that I wouldn't be able to juggle a family with a career.  In our modern society, girls are told every day of their life that they will be able to bring home the bacon and cook it too.  I never felt like this book passed judgment on whether or not balancing it all could be done.  Instead, I felt that it was an honest reveal of the every day struggle of the moderm working woman/super mom.  Extremely enlightening for a 20-something college student about to graduate into the real world.  I highly recommend Pearson's work.

B0001AVZA8|3.0|SGG is an enjoyable movie. Nicholson and Keaton make a nice couple, but I dont think Keaton deserved an Oscar no. The movie is a little long, but it's a fun romantic comedy...esepcially for the older folks.
B0001GL3K4|1.0|This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Richard Curtis scored a home run with his very original and touching &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; but with this film he has destroyed his credibility. He attempts to compensate for a lack of plot by throwing in numerous romantic entanglements set around Christmas-time (shamefully trying to play on audience nostalgia and warm feelings for this holiday) and big name stars. These stars cannot make up for what is at best a very uneven picture. Notable very early on in the film is perhaps the worst line ever conceived, which was supposed to be humorous: Emma Thompson, consoling a weeping Liam Neeson who has just lost his wife by telling him &quot; you have got to get a grip- no one is ever going to shag you if you won't stop crying&quot;. This is funny? Curtis attempts to invoke nostalgia for &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; by using a funeral scene to demonstrate love lost, but unlike the wonderful scene in &quot;Four Weddings&quot; where the fabulous WH Auden's poem &quot;Stop all the clocks...&quot; is used to great effect, in this scene a bad song by the Bay City Rollers is used to supposedly illustrate grief during the funeral scene, and succeeds very badly. I know we all love the British and we love these stars, but save yourself a disappointing 2 hours and 15 minutes- it never gets better than this.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Wicked ... by far and away ... the best musical to hit the broadway scene in the past 10 years!  I immediately fell in love with the score, knowing Schwartz was the composer!  The cast is great!  Idina proves she earned the Tony!!  The sweeping ballad's ... I'm Not That Girl ... For Good .. I feel everyone can connect with from the first lyrics of the songs. Every song is well written and original. All the action and just the history behind Elphaba, makes this a must have for the Wizard of Oz fan!  For the die hard musical fan, this is a must have in your broadway musical soundtrack collection!
B00005JMJ4|4.0|This is an arthouse film, being as other reviewers have said, atmosphere-driven rather than plot driven. It is 4 days in the life of 2 lost souls trapped in the same hotel in a foreign city who meet by chance and find themselves clinging to each other to stay upright. The cinematography is beautiful, the story is very realistic and in fact this is not a typical Hollywood May-December romance but something more beautiful and wholesome. Both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansen are able to convey emotions through their eyes which more than compensates for the uneven script- but give Coppola a chance and much credit for creating something beautiful and far from the Hollywood mold. Most impressive is Murray, who is able to convey a variety of conflicting emotions on his face without words- longing, desire, despair- and shows us there is far more to Murray than the terrific comic he is. I would like to see more serious fare from Murray. And from Coppola.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Slayer never made a bad album. A grate old school album. The band that help spread Metal. Slayer still makes kick ass albums and never sold out like Metallica.Its a classic Master piece!!!!!! also check out South of Heavan and Seasons In The Abys and get some Death. oh yeah Frank is a f^cking poser (click on Franks NOT-helpful button )
B000001IQH|5.0|Why?<br />First, whoever said that Tim Armstrong can't write songs is an idiot. THIS IS PUNK!!! You don't have to have the greatest lyrics. Of course it helps, (Greg Graffin and Mr. Brett from Bad Religion) but is not needed. <br />Second, Matt is amazing on the bass. He's probably the best bassist I've heard. A lot of bands nowadays just have the bassist play the same notes as the rhythm guitarist, and that gets boring. You can almost forget about the bass in those songs. Matt even SOLOS!! The solo in Maxwell Murder is the coolest thing I have heard in a punk rock song. Also a lot of bands have the volume on the bass turned down but you can clearly hear the bass in every song on this CD.<br />Third, the dual vocals are very, very cool. They help the CD not get old. It's cool not hearing the same voice on every song. This especially evident on songs like Roots Radicals, As Wicked, and Avenues and Alleyways where they switch in the middle of the song.<br />Fourth, the great punk feel to this album. I pop this album into my CD player and it makes me feel happy to be punk. It makes me want to get up and jump around. Sometimes I do (heh heh). Almost every song is fast, upbeat, and great. I would call this one of my favorite albums.
7119005901|5.0|If you are alive and know how to read you should read this book, no one in the world would give it less than 3 stars.  It is a very long book but it will be very much worth it to read anyway, and when you're done, you can brag to your friends that you've read a 2000+ page book.  It will go by much faster than you would think.
B0002BO0AS|5.0|This is a great album. Metalheads will love the guitarwork and solos, they are amazing. Hardcore kids will love the breakdowns. And both will love the vocals.  It is a very well-rounded CD. Everything you could ask for is here. The album doesn't break any barriers or do anything too risky, but it does impress.  Safe but really good to rock out to.  This is a must for any fan of hard music.
B00008CLOA|5.0|A truly amazing album that should be taken as a whole rather than song by song.  Each time I hear this album I'm amazed at the combination of great lyrics and awesome guitar/piano work.  By far, one of the greatest albums of the twentieth century.  Ignore the person who gave this album one star.  He or she is probably the same individual giving Britney Spears and Michael Bolton albums five star reviews.  Enjoy!!
B00004SCX6|5.0|This album is just so flawless,I remember when I bought this album way back in 2000 and I never got sick of it yet!<BR>The music on here is realy outstanding Britney just knows how to make amazing album's and this one is one of the best she ever made!<BR>Even though it's a 4 year old album it is still amazing I suggest young and old to pick a copy of it!
B0001MDP3G|4.0|2003 proved to be one of our better years in film, in recent memory, didn't it?<BR>After reading several other reviews, there is little to add, so let me reiterate:<BR>1) Anthony Minghella has created another romantic epic like (but not as good as) &quot;The English Patient&quot;. <BR>2) Jude Law and Nicole Kidman are fine, and Renee Zellweger is flat-out amazing. Compare &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot; to &quot;Chicago&quot; to this and her range is clearly impressive.<BR>3) The music is haunting and the cinematography lush.<BR>4) The battle scenes have a 'Saving Private Ryan&quot; immediacy to them, notably the opening one.<br />A beautifully told tale, which does the source novel proud.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I bought this album when it first came out, i thought it was a great cd, stronger being one of my favorite songs, u cant go wrong with buying this album, i trully recomend it, go buy it if you havent its worth the money.
014028009X|5.0|Bridget Jones allows us to see the world through her eyes for a year - a mid-30's \\"singleton\\" wrestling with her biological clock, her weight, drinking and smoking (whats wrong with that?), her struggle to find meaningful work, and her search for a man who is her equal - much the \\"everywoman\\" of our era. Her experiences with her family, co-workers, relationships with the opposite sex are hilarious, only because they are so close to the experiences of our own.  Fielding has done a remarkable job of creating someone who is honest, frank, a bit goofy, and very likable.  An enjoyable, witty and very funny book.  Highly recommended.
B00006CXXU|1.0|Yes it has and Christina proved it on this album!<br />The songs are so overrated and they are not good!<br />Trust me a pass away from this album!
B000002C4J|5.0|If you love Celine Dion, fine, by all means, this is an album you're going to want, but if you don't want adware and spyware installed on your PC, ONLY use this in your stereo.  This CD will install AOL adware on your PC, and you may not be able to enjoy Celine's music unless you follow a series of clicks.  Failing that, before you stick it into your computer, turn off the autorun function, holding down the shift key may not help you.<br />Alternately, you can complain to SONY about this at cd_extra@sonymusic.com
B00004SCX6|5.0|Oops she did it again thats what everyone says when they hear this album:)<BR>This album is great and so mature despite songs like &quot;Oops I Did It Again&quot; and &quot;Lucky&quot; even though I like them :)<br />The rest of the songs on here are very mature and has deep meaning to each song!<br />Pick up a copy of this album it is certainly worth every penny!
6304711905|5.0|Val Kilmers performance as Doc Holliday should have gave him the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in 1993.It was clearly the best performance to date of his carreer.Hollywood just seems to ignore and dismiss this type of movie. Kilmer steals the show from Kurt Russell,as Wyatt Earp.The powerful cast includes Micheal Biehn as Johnny Ringo, Sam Elliott as Virgil Earp, Stephan Lang as Ike Clanton, as well as Powers Booth, Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thorton,Michael Rooker, Billy Zane,Jason Priestley, and last but not least, Charlton Heston in a cameo appearance as rancher John Hooker.Again, Kilmer steals the show as Doc Holliday.His performance as a retired dentist that suffers from alcoholism and tuberculosis, is nothing less than masterful, first rate acting. Dennis Quaid played the same character in &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; that came out about six months later,  and this reviewer thinks his performance, while good, was not up to the same standard as Kilmer.There are many &quot;one liners&quot;that everone remembers and have become classic.A definite &quot;must see&quot; western that I would rate in the top five for all-time for this genre.
B00004SCX6|5.0|This is the best album I own.<BR>The songs are great her voice is great what else can you ask for?<BR>Pick this CD up you will love it!!!!!
B000002IWQ|5.0|In my eyes, there are four different types of Rush fans.<BR>1)Those that think that they like Rush because they've heard some of their songs and think they sound cool, but still don't really appreciate Neil's lyrical genius, or the entire trio's musical ingenuity.<BR>2)Those that just think that Rush could never do better than Moving Pictures<BR>3)Those that think the band has serious musical talent but can't stand Geddy's voice, and finally<BR>4)Those who buy every cd they have ever released, eat, drink, breath, and sleep their music, have every single lyric memorized, and would do just about anything to get to meet the band.<br />I consider myself a member of the fourth group, as I fit almost all of that criteria, and becuaes none of the other three are close to me.  People who think that Counterparts is a bad album, or not their best or slightly less than what they are capable of achieving should find themselves in the first three groups.  Any fan who is true to the band, and who understands and appreciates both the entire trio's musical talents, as well as Neil's sheer lyrical genius should know that this is another winner.  This band has been making the best music around for a long time, and they continue to do so with this album.  Some say that some of the songs are lacking in various areas, and to those people I say this: Are you out of your mind?  This is some of my favorite Rush material ever.  The powerful opening tracks(Animate, Stick it Out, and Cut to the Chase) demonstrate Alex's ability to write strong, moving riffs, and almost shows Neil's ever present skill behind a drum kit.  The ballads of the album(Nobody's Hero, Speed of Love, and Everyday Glory) clearly show Neil's talent in lyric writing.  The instrumental song &quot;Leave That Thing Alone&quot;  shows the band's obvious ability to play together, and to compliment each other in song.  The songs &quot;Between the Sun and Moon&quot;, &quot;Cold Fire&quot;, and &quot;Double Agent&quot; show the band's ability to be creative and to have fun while making their amazing music.  I will admit that I do not take a very heavy liking to &quot;Alien Shore&quot;, but it is still a strong song that I listen to with the rest of the cd.  There are no bad tracks on this cd in my opinion, I'd say they all demonstrate a different strength from the band and each of it's members.  I personally find myself with almost any of the songs on this cd stuck in my head close to everyday.  All in all this cd is a powerful album from start to finish, and show's the bands unbelievable ability to not only produce moving music, but to do it with an exceptional finesse found very rarely in most modern music.
B00004SCX6|5.0|On this album there are many beautiful ballads such as <br />&quot;When Your Eyes Say It&quot; (Such a sweet beautiful song)<br />&quot;Dont Let Me Be The last To Know&quot; (which was written by Shania Twains husband)<br />&quot;Where Are You Now&quot; (Amazing vocals shown on this song just amazing)<br />&quot;Dear Diary&quot; (Written by Britney herself,Very sweet song)<br />And the up tempo amazing Pop classics!<br />This album is great and is my fav album now for the past few years!
B0000035E7|1.0|If I had to sum up Nirvana's Bleach in one word, it'd be &quot;ouch&quot;. There is nothing on Bleach that makes it deserving of a rating higher than 1.5 stars out of 5. Although, I think you have to take into consideration of how ignorant many of the other reviewers of Bleach are; they're most likely all 18 and under and think they've already heard all the music under the sun. They've made the snap judgement that Nirvana is the end-all, be-all of the music world. How wrong they are. Anybody with at least one functioning ear will be able to discern that Bleach is nothing you want to spend money on. But even if you're deaf, the album cover and inlay should signal to you that these guys are a bunch of drunken laggerheads incapable of making anything with a tune to it. Even &quot;About a Girl&quot; sucks. The Unplugged version is miles beyond whatever the hell Kurt likes to call the style of this Bleach version. Too bad the only Nirvana gig worth listening to is Unplugged. But even that is so dry and boring you'll get sick of it and switch your disc changer back to the Beatles again... and burn your Bleach CD. I'm not kidding when I say Bleach isn't worth dropping money on. It's that bad. It's only worth listening to if you get it free along with a case of beer. Trust me, intoxication is the only way to get through Bleach in one puke-spewing sitting. But as horrendous as Bleach is, there Nirvana album even worse than Bleach. It's called From the Muddy Banks, and heed my advice: You don't even want that one for free.
B00004XONN|5.0|I can't help but think of a term thrown around in the seventies when I hear Kid A: Future Shock.  The idea was that modern technology was transforming our society at such speed that the world one was born into would bear little resemblance to the one of his/her adulthood.  While &quot;OK Computer&quot; outwardly attacked the homogenization of modern society, &quot;Kid A&quot; works its way inside-out from the belly of the beast; here, Radiohead captures the language of isolation, and expresses the apathy, the ennui, and, finally, the repressed violence of a lost generation.<BR>  &quot;Kid A&quot; is set in a very different context from &quot;OK Computer,&quot; embracing keyboard sounds, filters, computer processing: this furthers the overall metaphor by placing more distance between the listener and the artist.  &quot;Soundscape&quot; is a term thrown around when people refer to this CD.  The songs are set into large, open musical spaces that give a drifting feeling to all the songs; this effect is brought foward in the instrumental &quot;Treefingers&quot; as a strong expression of helplessness.  <BR>  &quot;Treefingers&quot; is a bridge between &quot;Kid A's&quot; primary section, which is more contemplative and complacent, and the secondary, dealing more with anger and violence aimlessly escaping into its evironment of complacency.  &quot;How to Dissapear Completely's&quot; refrain &quot;I'm not here, this isn't happening&quot; is a disassociation from the world and from one's self.  It's mirror image, &quot;Idiotecque&quot; rebels against this in its warning &quot;We're not scaremongering, this is really happening;&quot; the voice now looks with fear and hatred.<BR>  What begins in the lines of &quot;Everything in its right place/yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon&quot; (ie a good, organized life in which one feels a nagging sense of incompletion) later comes to terms in Morning Bell: &quot;You can keep the furniture, A bump on the head...Where'd you park the car?  Clothes are on the lawn...&quot;  A divorce scenario (&quot;Cut the kids in half&quot;) describes the breakdown of and breakaway from modern institutions and societal pressures.<BR>   This might seem ridiculously analytical, but Kid A is that kind of CD.  As &quot;Everything...&quot; concludes &quot;There are two colors in my head:&quot; the noise of modern society, of modern living, fills our minds all the time, and is often at odds with itself.  Radiohead attempts to come to terms with this dichotomy, or, perhaps, decides, &quot;I think you're crazy, maybe...&quot;
B0000048CP|5.0|well if you like under the sign of the black mark you gotta have this alubm too ..i think that the first song on this album A FINE DAY TO DIE is bathorys best song ever but there is more on this album ...songs like holocaust and pace til death are very fast and typical black metal...the sound quallity on this album is better than the first three records but i want to have that black metal feeling and on this album it is ...so buy tis album and choose your own favourite song and play it loud ....<BR>Sadly i must say that the singer and the frontman of bathory Quarthon has sadly past away in a age of 39 ...he died in june 7 2004 ...rest in peace ........buy this album and keep the memory of Quarthon alive
B0001AP12G|5.0|I usually do not buy hip-hop albums but I decided against it this time and I am certainly glad that I did.  Kanye West has definitely brought a new sound to hip-hop music.  He has given us a new wardrobe as well as new subjects to think about.  He has a variety of music on this album which makes the album that much more intriguing.  I must tip my hat off to Kanye West for creating and producing one of the best hip-hop albums in a long time.
B000001Y5J|5.0|This is more of an EP than an LP.  But what it lacks in length, it certainly more than makes up for in intensity.  &quot;Broken&quot; packs a punch and I like it more than &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; or &quot;The Fragile&quot; -- at least at times when I crave very angry music. (The other two are more very good and diverse collections but just aren't the 100% pure angry energy that &quot;Broken&quot; is.)<br />If you're not a NIN fan, you many not connect with this album.  I'd recommend &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; as the NIN primer for those new to the band, and I'd recommend this one for the NIN fan who just wants some primal anger and energy.
0759598029|5.0|I loved this book. It made me laugh and cry. Very imaginative but also very down to earth. Sebold did an excellent job with this. We all live on even when we are not with the living. I'd recommend this book to anyone willing to open their mind and heart. Thanks Alice.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Sofia Coppola has created a remarkably human work that touches on the very connections of the human soul.  Every time I've viewed this film I've found different things to appreciate, and different perspectives in which to view it.  It is an incredibly deep, but easily enjoyable and relatable film.<BR> The entire movie focuses on the relationship between a washed up old actor(Bill Murray) and a college graduate with a workaholic husband(Scarlett Johansson).  The actor, Bob Harris, is in Tokyo shooting commercials for a brand of whiskey.  Charlotte(Johansson), is there with her husband because she \\"had nothing better to do.\\"  The two get to know each other over chance encounters at the hotel bar, and then find themselves spending much of their time together.   They develop a close relationship, but Bob knows eventually he must leave.  Much of the beauty of this film lies in its exploration of the bond between Bob and Charlotte.  The film succeeds due in part to its focus solely on this relationship over a brief period of time.  Coppola doesn't try to take on too much, which allows her to explore the beauty of these two lives intertwined much more effectively.  <BR> The film is also effective because of the superb performances of its two main actors.  Bill Murray was nominated for an Oscar for his performance, and deserves to win.  He puts on a stunning performance that is both sardonically funny, and touching.  The young Scarlett Johansson is shockingly talented, as shown in this world.  Upon my repeated viewings, I came to realize each time that her performance was a larger part of my enjoyment of the film than I had previously thought.  Both Murray and Johansson surprised me: Murray because I did not know he could take on a serious role with such brilliance, and Johansson because of her youth, and no previous work of note aside from her good performance in Ghost World, which still was nothing compared to this.  The film is not really a comedy, though it has been billed as such at the Golden Globes.  That is alright, however, as it allowed it to win best picture there.  At heart though, Lost In Translation is a drama.  It is a drama that will make you laugh a little, but it is still a drama.  It is certainly one of the top films this year, and in fact one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It is truly original, and I cannot think of any real comparison for it.  <BR>I have attempted not to give too much away, but I will say that Bob and Charlotte's relationship stems not only from their loneliness, but from their attempts to deal with problems associated with different stages in life.  Charlotte is attempting to find herself, saying, \\"I don't know what I'm supposed to be.\\"  Bob is having a sort of mid-life crisis, admitting, \\"I was thinking of buying a Porsche.\\"  Charlotte and Bob help each other through their unique crises and while they are with each other even seem happy.  It is this connection that the film explores so brilliantly.  It shows us the weakness of these characters, and their need for something to help them through it.  And they find what they need in each other, even if it is for a short period of time.  I will not spoil the ending, but only say that the ambiguity of the final scenes only adds to the brilliance of this film.  Sofia Coppola has created a masterpiece.
B0001BKAEY|2.0|Epic in scale with a major thumbs up for the visual effects. But in the final analysis - eye candy cannot overcome the awful plot and characters. The original Matrix film was kick butt comic book stuff that the Wachowski Bros nailed cold and amazingly pegged the paradox of our anxiety about technology versus our desire to control it and enhance ourselves.  <br />This film and RELOADED both offered plenty of \\"Matrix\\" continuity for the scifi squirrels - but REVOLUTIONS; more than its predecessors, quickly sours dramatically and becomes boring, looking like a bad music video by the end with 'Battlestar Galatica' type plot elements. Combine that with the philosophical, allegorical pretensions and it simply implodes into an embarrassing mess. Completionists will buy the movie for their collections but others should steer clear.
B000002MH5|4.0|I just got done listening to &quot;Get Me&quot; and was compelled to write this review.  I've owned this disk for a long time, but it rarely gets a spin.  I guess I've heard it so many times and there is so much good music out there to discover that I don't have the time to listen to it much.  Anyway, I write this review because after listening to &quot;Get Me&quot; once again I am reminded of how talented a guitarist J. Mascis is.  I put him up there with Jerry Garcia, Trey Anastasio, Jimmy Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughn.  He's that good.  Overall, this disk is not only a series of good songs, but of extraordinary guitar work.  Some people may be put off by the poor vocals, but still this disk is better than 95% of the music released in the 1990s.
B000002UAC|5.0|Because the Beatles fame and success came so quickly and intensely, it would have been forgivable if their second album didn't match the high quality of their debut.  But, in trademark Beatle fashion, they not only matched it, they topped it.  The same kind of material is here, just better.  \\"I Wanna Be Your Man\\", \\"It Won't Be Long\\", \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\", \\"Little Child\\", and \\"Hold Me Tight\\" made \\"With The Beatles\\" the most downright *hard rocking* album you could get at the end of 1963.  But to even it out, some slower numbers are included, all of which are sublime.  \\"All I've Got to Do\\" is gorgeous, and \\"Don't Bother Me\\", George Harrison's first original, is actually one of the best tracks on the album.  Even \\"Till There Was You\\", a cover of a musical number, is a standout (and the guitar solo proves just how accomplished a guitar player George really was).  The only possible gripe for this fantastic album is that their originals are now so good that the covers sound a little bland in comparison.  But don't worry, that's something they would remedy on the next album.<BR>~John Ballantyne
B00008EY9G|1.0|I had high hopes for this movie since it starred several excellent actors. My husband and I had a difficult time sitting though this silly movie without walking out. As it was, we stayed through the credits hoping to catch the name of the psychiatric consultant so we could send a poison pen letter. Wisely, no psychiatrist allowed his or her name to be associated with that movie. <br />I did not find the end of the movie surprising, because it was similar to some of the &quot;multiple personality&quot; themes that were once popular in daytime soap operas. I suspect that modern soap opera audiences are now sufficiently sophisticated to see through that old theme.   <br />Many small and large details were laughably and gratuitously wrong. <br />The actors performed well but the stupidity of the plot kept me from enjoying this.
B000002UA9|5.0|\\"Please Please Me\\" may be eclipsed by the Beatles later efforts, but their debut is a fine one.  They had been gigging for a good few years with material, so it's no surprise they were confident and tight enough to blast out most of this album in less than ten hours.  What this results in is a very energetic and consistent album.  Due to this, it all flies by in an incredible rush that makes it easy to ignore just how great the music is.  The covers are all very well chosen and perfectly sum up the group's influences, but what is most surprising is that their originals are just as good as anything the artists they covered could have cooked up.  This results in a very smooth flow of consistently high-quality pop rock.  \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" is a great attention-getter, and I wouldn't be surprised if this is the track they opened their club gigs with (indeed, the \\"one two three four!\\" shout of Paul McCartney is one of the most recognizable album introductions ever).  \\"Misery\\" and \\"Ask Me Why\\" recall their favorite girl groups, the title track could have been written for Roy Orbison, and \\"Twist and Shout\\" is a screaming end to the album.  Oh, sure, some of the material has aged (\\"P.S. I Love You\\", for example), but with grace and charm.  Even if the Beatles made many better records than this, it still stands its ground as a classic debut and a great, great pop album.<BR>~ John Ballantyne
B0001AP12G|5.0|I see alot of stupid people saying a bunch of crazy junk about Kanye being corny and has a bad flow. I want everyone to do something. Listen to a Chingy, J-Kwon, or some random southern rapper CD and then listen to Kanye West. Kanye West is much more real than all the other new artists. Anybody who is a REAL fan of hip hop knows that hip hop is in a pitiful condition right now. I'm from the south people... Yeah you already know what I'm getting at... Everyone I see wants to have a nappy afro or nappy braids and have a mouth full of gold or platinum. And everyone wants to listen to bull like Lil Scrappy, Lil Jon, Trillville, and all that junk. Don't get me wrong I love the south. And I like Ludacris, Young Buck, Outkast, and others.. But this is just ridiculous. Everybody wants to act like they're on crack. And yall know I'm tellin the truth. If you heard Yung Wun's new song then I know you agree. And what is everybody rapping about? Ice, Money, Cars, Hoes, and everybody's new screwed up phrase is &quot;Get Crunk&quot;. And there's no real vibe. None of it is real. Its just a bunch of crackheads with messed up teeth yelling and screaming. What Kanye West delivers in the College Dropout is real. He is a much better rapper than all these other rappers. <br />Kanye touches topics like living with no money hustling to live on &quot;We Don't Care&quot;. &quot;All falls down&quot; is probably my favorite track. It basically talks about everybody being conscious of themselves and people thinking they can solve all their problems with money. &quot;Spaceship&quot; talks about when everything just goes downhill in your life. &quot;Jesus Walks&quot; is probably one of the best tracks of this whole year let alone rap music. &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; was really amazing especially when Jay-Z came in for the second time right before the song ended. It gave you a very inspirational feeling. The same can be said for &quot;Two Words&quot; which was AMAZING!! Especially Mos Def's part. Now that was REAL hip hop. &quot;Family Business&quot; was a nice good and soulful song about growing up with your cousins and family members.<br />This album is pretty much flawless and delivers a much realer vibe than &quot;Yung Wun&quot; or &quot;Lil Scrappy&quot;. He may not flow as well as some other artist but what is the use of them having talents to rap so well if they use it to rap about Ice, Money, Cars, and Hoes? Kanye West's music delivers a realer vibe than any other new artists you will see today.
B000002UAF|5.0|Although they were gigging, recording singles, writing, *and* filming a movie, the \\"Fab Four\\" were able to put out what was undoubtedly their absolute best record yet - \\"A Hard Day's Night\\".  Their first two LPs left them with quite a track record, but this release takes everything that was good about them and amplifies it ten-fold, while taking anything that was remotely sub-par about them and obliterating it entirely.  All the Beatles albums are five-star classics, but this one is the first of five albums that I call the \\"Platinum Series\\" of Beatles albums.  To qualify for a Platinum Series album, the album has to be a straight-through perfect listen.  Not one track can be even ever-so-slightly sub par.  Every song not only has to be brilliant, but it has to be just as good as the song before and after it.  That is what happens here - the whole record flows like honey and not a solitary note is out of place.  A big part of the reason why this album achieves that title is because every song on here is an original.  The covers were the only thing dragging \\"With the Beatles\\" down, so they just got rid of them.  And, remarkably, every track is a masterpiece.  Even so, I suppose I could pick \\"the best\\" songs.  The title track is excellent, as is the impressively sophisticated \\"If I Fell\\".  \\"I'll Cry Instead\\" features some of their best lyrics to date, and \\"I'll Be Back\\" is a masterpiece in every possible aspect.  From that list, it's clear that this is obviously John's album (unlike the McCartney-driven later works), but Paul lets loose with his own excellent tracks.  \\"And I Love Her\\" is wonderful (with an incredibly infectious bridge) and \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" features some great and original chord changes.  I suppose if I absolutely *had* to gripe about something, it's that Ringo doesn't get to sing anything.  But that doesn't stop the album from earning my \\"Platinum Series\\" title.  Overall, \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" is the best Beatles album to date, and one of the best Beatles albums in general.<BR>~ John Ballantyne
B0002858YS|4.0|Once you get past their name, which will only take you a few seconds into the first track, you realize that this band is special. The first obvious comparison is Franz Ferdinand, which is a shame because it is so easy to pigeon-hole them into that category of retro, umm, whatever. I think it is the synthesizers that give it an eightees feel. Or maybe its power lyrics like &quot;I've got soul, but I'm not a soldier.&quot; The retro sound seems more coincidental than intentional, however, becuase they are obviously not trying to sound like anyone else. The eleven tracks go by way to fast, and left me wishing their was more. Unlike Franz, the Killers don't leave much room for &quot;Weirdness,&quot; for lack of a better word. That makes them instantly accessible, but makes me fear the album won't have much staying power. I am not to worried about it though because for right now, it sounds great.
B00003CXCT|1.0|There's no excuse for not releasing the Original versions of the trilogy to dvd.  Lucas can do whatever he wants with the movies, as long as that doesn't mean pretending the original versions don't exist.  That's what he is doing, however.<br />These will be even further enhanced with additional changes made since the 1997 theatrical releases.  George Lucas has ruined these movies, for both first-generation fans as well as future fans.  Changing something permanently that so many people contributed to is unforgivable.  The special effects were groundbreaking, but future viewers will not be able to see film history as it really was.  Lucas has wiped it out in favor of computer generated effects and such.  <br />Some people feel this doesn't matter.  If movies matter to you at all- if they hold any importance to you whatsoever- you will consider boycotting this release.  Whether it's music, movies, books, paintings-- art, whether the fine arts or pop-art, needs to be preserved.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|If you want to know what is really going on in music, skip Amazon.com, and go to Amazon's UK site. Unavoidably, they will still have the mainstream garbage, but scattered throughout their top selling albums are the gems that will either hit the American charts in a month or two, or will get overlooked by the American scene. A case in point is Franz Ferdinand's album. On the UK chart, this album has been in the top ten for a while now, and in the US it has finally broken into the top 50. And the UK is correct to embrace this album. The comparisons to The Strokes, Interpol, and The Rapture are evident, but that doesn't stop Franz Ferdinand from breaking some new ground and establishing themselves as a force to be reconned with. The album is fun and highly addictive.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Seeing this movie was quite a privelege, the sheer fact alone that Mel Gibson got me excited about a religious movie is quite a feet in itself. You see, I am not a very religious person, however I can that as beautiful as this movie was, it sure is not going to change my life. I do have to credit this film however with instilling in me a bit more respect and sympathy for the suffering of the Christian and to some extent the Judeo faiths. To sum it up, if you are already religious this film will reaffirm your beliefs, and if your not, well at the very least it will at least help you to tolerate and to some extent identify with the respected religions that are represented.
078322804X|4.0|The musical was so out of favor by 1980 that had Universal advertised &quot;Blues Brothers&quot; for what it was it would have done even more poorly at the box-office than it did.  But time has righted that wrong and Dan Ackroyd and John Belushi's wacky star turn has taken it's place  beside the other great examples of this unique American film art.  It's too long, the colossal car chase near the end is a bore, and it's based on the mistaken notion that church property in America is taxed (something Canadian Ackroyd, the main scriptwriter, apparently assumed and nobody else caught).  But there are so many other wonderful moments of singing and dancing and left-field comedy that everything else is forgiven and then some.  Directed by the erratic John Landis, who's main signature as a director is some of the best photography in the history of the American movies.
B00005JM02|1.0|First off I must explain that I was sixteen when I saw this, and I don't have any sort of appreciation for mushy uplifting movies from Disney. However my problem with this film is that its been so wrongly labeled as like a sort of comedy. Quite frankly its a boring 1 and a half hour tirade of some stupid fish dad trying to find his little kid. Theres nothing funny whatsoever about it. It's..Boring... Then add to this films detracting features we also have the annoying and never intelligent Ellen Degeneres as the voice of some dumb founded fish. Honestly the movie sucks, it might be enjoyable for the little ones, but I dont even I could find this crap watchable at that age, especially given the low attention spans. If you want a good family flick and by family I mean everyone single person, can enjoy watch Shrek, or better yet one of Disney's classics like the Lion King, Aladdin, or Snow White. Please for the sake of your childrens taste in movies, keep the lil chitlins away from this garbage.Oh yeah, and those stupid turtles surfer dudes, dumbest most pointless attempt at humour...ever.
B00005RRG9|5.0|This was the highest grossing box office success in America in 1961 and if there isn't a statue of Hayley Mills in Disneyland there oughta be.  Her successive hits for Walter and Roy Disney bailed them out of a tight spot financially.  Ms. Mills effortless adolescent charm is backed by two first rate performers in Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara and neither was ever better.  The plot about separated twins is older than Shakespeare and doesn't bear too close examination, but the theme of a re-kindled love and re-united family is one very few of us can resist.  Highly recommended.

B000083C49|4.0|I read a lot of these Amazon reviews on Star Trek IV, and oddly enough I can agree with almost all of them -- the 5 star as well as the 1 star.<BR>I agree with the 5 star reviewers that this probably is the best Trek movie, that a lot of the humor is good, that the movie captures much of what was loved about the original series. <BR>But I also agree with some of the 1 star reviews that the humor may be overdone and may wear thin on repeated viewings, that Catherine Hicks' character is overemphasized, that the environmental message is heavy-handed, that the aliens at Kirk's trial look ridiculous, etc.<BR>But ultimately the question is this: If I stumble on this movie while channel-surfing, will I stop and watch it? Will I laugh, or at least smile, at the designated humorous moments? Answer to both questions: Yes. On balance, it remains an entertaining flick.

B000002UUX|5.0|let me start off by saying that i have been a long time megadeth fan and i find them more appealing than metallica even though i'm huge fan of metallica's old stuff only i have to admit that Mustaine's vocals arn't great but hey his skills make up for that little defect. this album displays the work of 2 awsome guitarist who don't hog as much popularity as Hetfield and Hammet who receive so much credit as a guitar duo one of the only things that seriously pisses me off is that fact that they call this megadeth' highly overrated album i think that's just stupidity since every band has to release a masterpiece at some point in their careers that everyone talks about there's that and that fact that some people B!#%h about something that is overrated but then if a good band's material goes unseen and uncredited they B!#%h that other more respected bands get more attention while the other band doesn't get squat for their efforts in an underrated album... the only thing other thing have to say is that basically only true metal fans are able to appreciate work like this so go out and buy this album if you're one of those people you won't be disappointed MEGADETH KICKS (...)!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00029LNHS|5.0|When I first heard \\"Where is the Love\\" last summer, I couldn't stand it. I dismissed the Black Eyed Peas as one hit wonders and waited for their moment to pass. Then I heard \\"Shut Up\\" and was surprised I liked it. It wasn't until I heard \\"Hey Mama\\" that I fell in love with them. This CD is by far the best hip hop album right now because each song, even \\"Where is the Love\\", sounds good when you listen to the entire album. In my opinion, they are just as good, if not better, than that other visionary hip hop group, Outkast. Each song sounds like a radio smash, and it's not surprising this group has moved past the one hit wonder tag.<br />1)Hands Up- gets the CD off to a good start. One of the best party songs of the past few years. The perfect opener for this CD.<BR>2)Labor Day- probably my favorite song on the CD. The beat is infectious, the vocals are top notch, and I think would be an even bigger hit than \\"Hey Mama\\" if they release it as a single.<BR>3)Let's Get Retarded- the title threw me off at first, but they say right off the bat it's not meant to be offensive. It really is a good song and it's no wonder it is their latest single.<BR>4)Hey Mama- yes, it's not the same version we heard on the radio, MTV, and VH1. Does that make this version bad? No, the track still holds up even without the excellent Fergie vocals heard on the single version.<BR>5)Shut Up- I like the way this song sounds. The vocals play off each other very well, and even though it's about a disastrous relationship, you can still dance to it.<BR>6)Smells Like Funk- another really good song. I like the beat.<BR>7)Latin Girls- a little long, but it's still a really good song.<BR>8)Sexy- I like the feel of this song. It's very smooth and it sounds great.<BR>9)Fly Away- a great showcase for Fergie. She probably sounds her best on this song.<BR>10)The Boogie That Be- another really good party song. The beats are really strong.<BR>11)The APL Song- a good song. I like the way this song tackles an overused subject but still makes it sound very good.<BR>12)Anxiety- a surprisingly strong rock song. The appearance of Papa Roach sounds strange in theory, but makes perfect sense when you hear it. <BR>13)Where is the Love- not my favorite, but I really do like this song now. I understand the lyrics more now. They even make Justin Timberlake look good.<BR>14)Let's Get It Started- the radio version of Let's Get Retarded. My only problem with it is that if they could put this single onto the CD, why couldn't they put the version of Hey Mama we all want to hear on it?<BR>HIDDEN TRACK)Third Eye- probably the most political song on the CD. I really enjoyed this song and think it's the perfect way to close a near-perfect album.<br />I highly recommend this CD. I can't think of one song that I don't like, and that is a rarity nowadays. This album should have gotten so much more praise from critics than it got, but I believe someday this album will get the respect it deserves.

B00014NE62|5.0|I mean ME - I am obsessed with this film! I have fallen in love with beautiful Cambridge (so masculine and steeped in tradition), with the romantic Edwardian era, with the beauty of the story and especially with Maurice, the title character. Beware... if you're \\"susceptible\\" to romantic movies and is a highly sensitive person, chances are this movie will \\"get\\" to you in ways I can't fully describe. It doesn't matter if you are [...] or straight - against your will, scenes and images from the film will replay in you mind, stay in your heart and affect your mood and feelings (for days, in my case - which is not a good thing because I have a major examination coming up and half my mind is still on \\"Maurice\\"!). At times, I wished I was born male like the characters, and have the privilege of a Cambridge education... pure wishful thinking (though I've a girl friend who got into Cambridge on a scholarship, to my eternal envy really).    This film is a faithful adaptation of E.M. Forster's novel and brilliantly brought to life by the winning team of Merchant Ivory. The stellar cast comprises James Wilby, Hugh Grant and Rupert Graves; all 3 share great screen chemistry and there is no doubt that the actors gave it their \\"all\\" for this film.    This is the story about one man's journey of self discovery on his sexuality and having to live with the prejudices of the times including class distinction (which balks at intimacy with a social inferior, in this case Maurice's desire for Alec). Many reviews have already been written about the story so I would just like to share some of my thoughts and observations of the film:    1) the DVD (R1, released Feb 2004) is beautifully packaged and is chockful of special features including more than 10 deleted scenes, one of which is a most sensual scene involving Maurice and Alec (an \\"extended\\" scene of their first night together). The production notes/booklet also provides a treasure of information on the film.    2) James Wilby plays \\"Maurice\\" most beautifully and sensitively. He is imperfectly handsome but is still very attractive-looking. The thing that strikes me most about Wilby's \\"Maurice\\" is that he has the MOST beautiful hair color - it's practically \\"golden\\" - not the usual blonde. The color contracts nicely with the black suit he usually wears. In the novel, Maurice has dark hair, but I think a golden-haired Maurice is just perfect - a great contrast too to Clive's and Alec's dark locks!!    3) Clive (Hugh Grant) is a year older than Maurice. When they get together, Maurice is about 21. By the time they break off, Maurice is nearing 24. Nothing is mentioned in the book/movie about Alec (Rupert Graves)'s age - but I gather he is the youngest of the three (although most certainly the lustiest!!).    4) Maurice's character is passionate, loving, vulnerable and super-loyal. If Clive had not rejected him, Maurice would have been \\"his for life\\". What's with Clive anyway? He's got this idea that a relationship between 2 men should be strictly platonic - no kisses or caresses, even. (If I'm Clive, I don't think I'll be able to keep my hands off Maurice!). Thank goodness for the appearance of Alec later on, who is Clive's very opposite!    5) In the story, Maurice is horrified by his lust for and intimacy with Alec, who is only a servant. But one reason they are perfect for each other is because (in E.M. Forster's words): \\"chance had mated it (i.e. Maurice's body) too perfectly\\". The 2 characters' growing feelings for each other are a joy to watch.    6) For those who question the ending i.e. whether it is even possible for Maurice and Alec to stay together what with all the difficulties surrounding them, well, let me write that Forster intended the ending to be a happy one (and who would know better than the author himself?). In the \\"Terminal Note\\" at the end of his novel, Forster wrote: \\"A happy ending is imperative. I shouldn't have bothered to write otherwise. I was determined that in fictionanyway two men should fall in love and remain in it for the ever and ever that fiction allows, and in this sense Maurice and Alec still roam the greenwood...\\" Super, isn't it?    I don't want to forget this beautiful movie, and I can't forget it anyway. It is quite simply the most touching film I've ever seen. It deserved an armful of Oscar awards especially a Best Actor nod for Wilby (although in reality the film didn't do that well, receiving only Best Art Direction and Best Costume nominations). I've seen most of Merchant Ivory productions and \\"Maurice\\" is hands-down, the BEST. Don't miss it!

B00001U0DP|5.0|Never before has such a brilliant hybrid of comedy and the tradegy of war been so skillfully woven togen. The film, although disjointed slightly in its early stages, presents a delicate balance between the otrocities of the second world war and the genuine warmth and kindness of its protagonist. There are times when you will you laugh, others that you will feel deeply saddened by the plight of the characters, with the comfortable compromise reached at the film's conclusion leaving a pleasant after taste in spite of the circumstances. Brilliantly acted and filmed, Life is Beautiful presents a different take of what life was like in that dark period of history whilst leaving intact the integrity of the central themes and the brutality of war. This is a movie that can be enjoyed on multiple levels and is a worthy Oscar winner.
B00005V0X5|5.0|Im only 14 years old but Megadeth is my favorite band. All that kids listen to is crap like rap and wannabie rockers. This is one the most underated Speed/Thrash Album. Metallica's &quot;Kill em All&quot; was the first thrash album but Megadeth made it faster, harder, and meaner. It might take a while for new listeners I would recomend &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; or &quot;Countdown to Extinction.&quot; The demos on this CD are pretty cool and the commentary by Dave Mustaine and David Ellefson on each track are really cool.<br />Last Rites/Loved To Death (9/10)<BR>Killing Is My Business...And Business Is Good (11/10)(The best track)<BR>The Skull Beneath The Skin (10/10)<BR>Rattlehead (10/10)<BR>Chosen Ones (9/10)<BR>Looking Down The Cross (9/10)<BR>Mechanix (11/10)(Pretty much &quot;The Four Horsmen&quot; by Metallica but two times faster and two times better)<BR>These Boots (4/10)(Would be a 9/10 but the F*king blips kill it)<br />This is a great Megadeth album but very very far from thier best. They're just getting warmed up.
B000002H2H|5.0|As soon as I heard the title track I knew this album was something special. I am yet to find a thrash album with such a dominant theme, or 'feel' to it as RTL. Just looking at cover now captures what the album is all about - spine tingling power.<br />It starts off with a sold thump in the form of 'Fight Fire with Fire', with a great intro and riffing.<br />The crossover between tracks 1 and 2 is awesome. The title track 'Ride the lightning' is in my opinion one of the most underrated songs in the whole of rock music. If there can be a perfect heavy metal song it has to be this one. AWESOME intro, one of the greatest Metallica guitar solos and James Hetfield's vocals at his peak. His screaching '...wakened by horrid screams, freed from this freightning dream' is absolutely fantastic, I wish he had sung more like that in the other Metallica albums. This song, clocking in at 6:36, would make this album 10/10 even if that was the only good song on there. But it ain't...<br />'For whom the bell tolls' is an excellent innovation, in that the majority of the song's time is taken up in the excellent, plodding intro and the creepy fade out. This is also the only song on the album with no guitar solo. This track also stands out because of the terrific visual imagery it creates - despite being relateively short compared with the other tracks, it conveys a vivid atmosphere and aura of being in a wartime battle<br />'Fade to black' is very popular, but to be honest it doesn't do a lot for me. It serves the useful purpose of slowing the pace down significantly after the blistering speed of the earlier tracks. Very morbid, with lyrics that I have grown weary of over time and a moderate guitar solo. Definately not one of their best; its an average metal ballad.<br />'Trapped under ice' picks up the pace once again and provides the albums fastest song. Its a standard thrash outing with, once again, absolutely brilliant imagery created largely by Hetfield's lyrics and vocals. Guitarsolo is short and sweet, could have been a little longer and more complex.<br />'Escape' I feel is the weakest song, although my lack of love of this song is probably because it is significantly overshadowed by the other monster tracks on this album. The whole track lacks direction, with a pretty weak riff and solo. The lyrics are also substandard compared with the other masterpieces.<br />'Creeping death' is a terrific track, with excellent speed throughout. It tells of the plight of the Hebrews in the Old testament of the Bible, and is not a bad summary of the situation (for people like me who don't know too much about it!) A pretty good solo and high intensity throughout. Once again Hetfield shines in the vocals.<br />'The Call of Ktulu' - in my opinion, the GREATEST metal instrumental ever recorded. This song is just so well structured and executed by the boys that it is hard to believe its the same band as they are today with the stuff they have released lately. This is Metallica at their most powerful - the riffs and underlying chords used in this 9 minute monster are very complex and need to be listened to carefully to derive full enjoyment. An excellent solo by Hammett complements a suburb drum and base track by Ulrich and Burton repectively - the sudden speed up after the solo really gets me going, even after so many times of listening. In terms of metal creativity it doesn't get any better - the final stages of the track are so original in their design, with an absolutely explosive finish. Listen to this one LOUD!!!<br />Overall a brilliant metal opus, especially considering it is now 20 years since its release.
B000050X31|5.0|I am a long time magic flute lover, who has heard or owned most of the major recording out there.  Recently I started buying Mozart opera DVD's as they were good to introduce friends to the operas.  I first bought the recent Davis/Royal Opera version, but found it a very mixed bag, so I decided to go for this one since Kurt Moll was always my favorite Sarastro on record and he sings the part here (The Sarastro on Davis was very dissapointing).<br />The bad news is that Moll is not in quite as good voice as he was in either his Solti or Davis CD audio only performances. The good news is that he is still magnificent, and this is the best Zauberflote I have ever heard!<br />I never had much respect for James Levine as a conductor. Well that has changed.  For reference, my favorite flute's ever were 1)Christie on Erato 2)Klemperer on EMI 3)Beecham on EMI.  All had there problems, but Christie I found to be the overall best flute I knew including all cast, conducting, acting, and recording.  And it has been replaced by a DVD flute!<br />What I loved about this performance:<br />First of all the conducting is very fine. It is very sharp and disciplined performance with precise singing (litte romantic sliding of notes) and there is, best of all, a wonderful sense of listening between all the singers and the orcherstra. It was obviously meticulously rehearsed for the 1991 Mozart celebrations.  Mozart is the most difficult music to perform because you cannot get away with any emotional sloppiness, which means a luminous precision is always called for.  This performance has this quality better than any other I know.<br />There are some weak bits in my opinion however. A few of the arias really drag their feet in a failed attempt for the conductor and singer to find the right inspiration.  As much as I like Moll, I find his arias too slowly sung, as well as the Isis and Osiris chorale.  Fortunately they still are very effective due to Moll's maginificent voice and the solemn nature of the music itself.<br />Also, occasionally things can be a bit brisk to let the music breathe properly. Overall however, I would give this flute the best marks for conducting.<br />The singing/acting also has no weak links and many outstanding aspects.<br />Ariaza's Tamino is merely good--at his best with the speaker, and worst in final union music with Pamina.  After the first trial he slightly misses a key timing, which when sung perfectly (hear Blochwitz on Christie) is one of the most sublime moments in the score.  Still, this is a good, solid Tamino--well acted, suitably noble if a bit too old. Overall:B-<br />The three ladies are some of the most delightful I've heard. The 2nd has a slightly grating tone, but their timing, harmoninzing, and accuracy puts them right at the top. A-<br />Papageno is solid if rather a bit overdone. Hemm has a lusty, solid bavarian baritone which suits the part in my opinion. It is not a radiantly beautiful voice (hear Keenlyside on Davis), but solid and powerful.  Many papageno's have been more charming, but Hemm is still good, and very find in ensembles. B<br />Serra's Queen is up near my all time favorites: Popp on Klemperer, Dessay on Christie, Damrau on Davis. She rather lacks warmth however, which puts her slightly below these on the first aria. The 2nd is as good as anyone. A-<br />Battle's Pamina is my favorite ever. I feel it was this sort of voice Mozart had in mind for the part--a radiant soprano. Battle's interpretive insights have often left me cold before, but I find her Pamina just spot on. She plays it with a Tempest Miranda sort of innocence and wornder. I find this suits Pamina exactly. A+<br />Monostatos is also the best I have ever heard. Singers tend to make him rather bland for some reason, but this singer gives him oodles of dramatic force. A+<br />Boys are superb. Their trio with battle's Pamina is the finest I have known as well. One boy in particular has amazing power and accuracy. A<br />Sarastrois Moll not in his best voice, but it is still Moll. A<br />Choir.  Big American heavy vibrato style. Not my cup of tea, but more importantly the choral pieces are sung with genuine Masonic fervor that makes them satisfying regardless. B<br />Speaker. Andreas Schmidt is as fine here as I have ever heard him. Wonderful warmth and force. A<br />This is getting too long! While there is much in this performance that I still can imagine better, in overall quality this is by some margin the best performance I have heard or seen of this opera.  Certainly those who love particular parts more than others will find other performances superior (Tamino lovers for instance will always treasure Wunderlich/Bohm), but if you love every note of this opera as well as its Masonic themes, I would give this the top recommendation.<br />O, A+ english subtitles too.  Video,sound and production are good, though not the best in my opinion.  Overall the production has a sort of childish artistic style to it, which I thought was fine.  But then Im mostly here for the music.is Moll not in his best voice, but it is still Moll. A<br />Choir.  Big American heavy vibrato style.

B00028HBKM|1.0|This movie is one big Christian guilt trip. Mel Gibson obviously doesn't know anything about what Jesus would want. It's my firm belief that Jesus doesn't want us to watch him get brutally murdered, he wants us to see a movie that talks about what he teaches and how it's important. <br />I believe in God and Jesus, but I don't want to watch my savior get tortured for two hours. And for parents who bring their kids to see this movie . . . go to hell. This is not a kid's movie. It isn't that important that you should freak the crap out of your kids. I've seen kids that have seen this movie and it disturbs them greatly, as well as it should. One of the worst cases is of this crazy couple that took their autistic kid to see the 'Passion' and now that kid thinks that he's going to go to Hell. So, take that into consideration, it's R for a reason. <br />So, remember, this is not the most important film ever made, because films are never important. It isn't fun and movies were made to be fun. That is the point. And another thing do not buy the 'Passion' merchandise. People should not be able to merchandise Jesus like this. And who really wants a necklace of a nail that was put in Jesus's hand. <br />Mel Gibson if you actually cared about Christianity you'd give all the money you made off of the 'Passion', and I mean ALL of it and give it to a charity or two.
B00005MNP7|5.0|Eat to the Beat is Blondie's follow up to 1978's smash hit Parallel Lines. Most people seem to praise Parallel Lines as Blondie's finest contribution to rock n' roll history. Parallel Lines may have cemented the bands place in music history, but Eat to the Beat proves to be an equal match. It delivers more of a pop and new wave performance. The band was under a lot of pressure to offer up a solid hit album after the success of Parallel Lines. Eat to the Beat doesn't contain the hit singles that Parallel Lines brought to the table. The album peaked at #17 in U.S. and #1 in the U.K. \\"Dreaming\\" and \\"Atomic\\" managed to crack the top 40. Other singles failed to chart in the U.S. The album was far more successful in the U.K. \\"Dreaming\\" hit #2 and \\"Atomic\\" claimed the #1 spot. \\"Dreaming\\" has to be one the greatest moments in pop music. It gives drummer Clem Burke a chance to really show off his drumming skills. \\"Atomic\\" is a parody of a disco song and has since become a dance classic. Despite the chart failure in the United States, Eat to the Beat achieved platinum status. It was the first album to be released in video form. Music videos were just starting to become popular. Blondie helped to pioneer videos before the MTV boom. The videos helped to showcase lead singer Deborah Harry with her raw sexuality and beauty. She really shines through in the videos for \\"Sound-A-Sleep\\" and \\"The Hardest Part.\\"     Eat to the Beat is a pretty solid album. It's pure pop and easy on the ears. Make sure you pick this one up along with Parallel Lines.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I liked the first album a lot, and grew to like it even more over time. This new album is great! I like every song, and think that it is so worth your money. She sings about many different subjects, many having to do with guys. This is good because there's almost a song for every mood. Get it, you won't be disappointed.
B000001EIA|4.0|During the 1990's, it seemed every band was releasing an MTV Unplugged album. So Kiss, savvy businessmen that they were, decided to release their version with a unique twist. Kiss Unplugged included the reunion of the original lineup of Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, Ace Frehley, and Peter Criss. This album would lead to the cash cow that became the return of the original Kiss in full makeup that were worldwide superstars from 1974-1979.<br />However, what this album should be best known is for the recorded proof of Simmons and Stanley's underrated songwriting abilities and the strong musicianship of the 1995 or &quot;new&quot; version of Kiss that included guitarist Bruce Kulick and drummer Eric Singer. Like Eric Clapton and Neil Young's albums from the MTV Unplugged series, Kiss' version is largely comprised of lesser known album tracks or &quot;deep cuts&quot;, several of which the band hadn't performed in many years. The excellent tracks &quot;Comin' Home&quot; and &quot;Goin' Blind&quot; are salvaged from the great but muddy sounding Hotter Than Hell album and show how innovative Simmons' playing was in the early years. &quot;See You Tonight&quot; from Simmons' solo album is a true surprise and blows the original away. Stanley's voice is in fine form throughout, especially on the ballads &quot;I Still Love You&quot; and &quot;Every Time I Look At You.&quot; Eric Singer's drumming is very strong here, throwing in quick fills on many of the tracks but never overplaying. Bruce Kulick's playing on the album is also great, particularly on the hard rocker &quot;Domino&quot;, the somber &quot;A World Without Heroes&quot;, and the aforementioned &quot;Goin' Blind.&quot;  Other great tracks include &quot;Sure Know Something&quot;, which features Simmons' coolest bass line ever, and the seldom heard but great tracks &quot;Rock Bottom&quot;, complete with Stanley's acoustic intro, and &quot;Plaster Caster.&quot; Also worth noting is that the bravado that Simmons and Stanley regularly exhibit performing live is surprisingly absent here.

0385510438|5.0|This is ellen in atlanta and A Time to Kill was my favorite Grisham book--until now. He's back to his excellent writing and beautiful character studies. Some authors am giving up on, but Grisham, write about what you want--keep your heart in Ford County!
B000060OFT|3.0|Read kerki and Eric's review. I won't be redundant and say the same things, because I agree wholeheartedly. Visually, this was quite stunning..beautiful. The outlandish, as they say &quot;MTV&quot; look was good, kinky, modern. If they would have dropped the accents and brought Shakespeare's words into today's vernacular, I probably would have given it 5 stars.  The new story idea was that good.  The cast was delicious, as were the sets. It's really too bad.  With just the one change to modern English, this could have become a cult classic.  As stands now, I'll just keep watching Zeferrelli's version forever. Now, that's Shakespeare.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|This is a embarrassingly cheesy film.  With that said and done with, I must admit I loved it.  I choked back a fair amount of  `happy tears.'  I feel sorry for the other reviewers that expected another \\"Four Weddings, and a Funeral.\\"  I expected nothing, so I was pleasantly surprised to receive a symphony of love from many different and often colorful perspectives.  The porno stars were hilarious and surprising, the innocent love of the young boy sweet, the adulterous spouse a dramatic reality, and the sacrificing sibling of a schizophrenic brother touching.  One warning to the feeble minded, the many characters and their stories utilized in this film might be daunting to those lacking the simplest of cognitive abilities.
B00008J4P5|1.0|This is supposed to be innovative? Since when is not knowing how to play an instrument innovative???  I really thought these two Trogladites were a joke when I first heard about them on TV a few years ago...then they started popping up everywhere...I weep for my own generation...
B00008ADPF|5.0|Nickelback are great. They're one of the best ongoing bands there is. They've had 4 albums in total (that including their very first album the curb). Ok, so The curb isn't particuarley good, but for the true nickelback fan its interesting to see what they first sounded like before they got famous. I have all of their albums and i think they're a great band. I bought their 2nd album &quot;The state&quot; in America...which is actually quite good. Then of course, Silverside up was released and that was a huge success, it is a great album, with &quot;This is how you remind me&quot;. THat song has to be like, one of the best songs in history! And their new album The long road is even better, it shows that Nickelback have matured, and the lyrics are deeper i think, but the songs are just as heavy which is great. Nickelback really are a great band, and when i saw them in concert, they kicked ass.Also, Chad Krogers a really nice guy, people shouldn't diss Nickelback just because they don't like them, like it or not, Nickelback are a really successful band, and they should atleast be given some credit for stayin together for so long and releasing... 3 great albums. They're one of the great bands that has continuity (e.g Linkin Park, Papa Roach) all these bands have released more than one great album (You like Nickelback, buy The long road, you won't be disappointed...  :)
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Wow. I am loving the harder sound and serious lyrics in this latest album of Avril. It's sad seeing people dissing the CD just because it sounds harder than Let Go. I'm a person who listens to Linkin Park and all those harder bands. I am glad Avril chose to go a more meaningful route (in the same as Evanescence). It's just plain better. &quot;Nobody's Home&quot; is a terrific track! In second place would be &quot;My Happy Ending&quot;. These songs are a big step up from &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;. That song would be more of the &quot;Let Go&quot; album style. Go get this CD if your a punk-rock fan. An Evanescence fan might like it (maybe a bit lovey though).
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence are absaloutely amazing! They kick ass majorly, ok so they're not like really heavy, some people describe them as pop rock, others as goth rock, but whatever they are they rule. Amy Lee has the best voice of a woman i have ever heard. Her voice is so perfect..she sings the songs really well and theres a nice range on the album. Theres two really depressing songs on the album: My Immortal and Hello, but then theres kick ass tracks like Bring me 2 life and My last breathe. All the songs are amazing in one way or another, i can't stress enough how great this album is. I know alot of people give Evanescence stick and say they're crap, well they can't be crap if they sold something like 5 million copies, and they won 2 grammy awards, therefore not makin them crap. And they're not over rated atall, there's loadsa hyp about Evanescence bein great, the reason for this is because they are. Their album kicks ass, Amy Lee has an absaloutely amazing voice, she can sing, and the rest of the band members play the music well, the piano in My Immortal is great, and all of the guitars throughout the album are good. The band version of My Immortal is really good, because the drums come in where theres usually only the piano. This album is one of the best albums there ever has been in the world of rock/pop. Buy it! Or atleast listen to it, and then buy it :p If you don't like the album, wish you did, coz you're really missin out!!
B0000028M7|5.0|Man, I hadn't listened to this album in YEARS, until I found a copy when I was going through some of my old things.  Well, it's found a new home in my CD collection.  Alice In Chains was one of my favorite bands in the early 1990's, but for some reason, I stopped listening to them a while back.  Obviously, I'm a complete idiot for this.  Songs like &quot;Them Bones,&quot; &quot;Would?,&quot; and &quot;Rooster&quot; were staples of modern rock radio, and completely unforgettable.  But there are some tracks on here that I had neglected over the years, like the beautiful &quot;Down in a Hole&quot; and the heavy &quot;Angry Chair.&quot;  To me, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden were more metal bands than grunge bands, but if your grunge collection begins and ends with Nirvana, then you should wake up and buy all of the Alice in Chains discs, but definitely start it off with &quot;Dirt.&quot;
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Avenged Sevenfold are amazing! I only heard about them a few months ago, from my mate, he said they were great. So i bought their album &quot;Waking the fallen&quot;. The songs on this album are amazing!! I don't usually like really heavy music, so at first i didn't really like Eternal Rest and I wont see you tonight part 2 but i loved the kick ass music that went with it, then i realized even tho i didn't particuarley like the song, the music contemplated it, but now coz the music is so kick ass on these two tracks,i now just love the songs anyway, theres not one song on this album im not too keen on apart from maybe Desecrate through Reverence, but even that id give 3 stars. Every single song on this album is outstanding. The music is amazing, the lyrics are cool, and Mudrock Shadows, his voice is wow. He can go from calm sounding singing to growling. This is what i love about Avenged Sevenfold (apart from the lead singer bein fit) the album varies, theres some heavy songs, some softer songs, as i said i dont usually like really heavy stuff, but i reckon because they're so good i wouldn't mind if the whole album was heavy. I gotta say tho, eventhough other bands like Autumn to Ashes and...Poison the Well are ok, (well i dont really like them) but coz Avenged Sevenfold are so great, i think they make other hardcore bands sound a bit lame. E.g you compare a heavy song from Autumn to Ashes with a heavy kick ass song from A7X, Avenged Sevenfold sound so much better, Mudrocks shoutin sounds so much more heavy and its more quality lol. Ok.,well not everyone will agree with me, but Avenged Sevenfold rock this world
B00000AFHM|5.0|When I sit at home on a lazy summer day (bored as usual) there's a certain album that I can just lie in bed and let it take me away into another world. This album is it. I was recently introduced to Belle and Sebastian through a friend, who was listening to their album Dear Catastrophe Waitress. I liked it quite a bit, and decided to explore the band further. The end result was that I found one of my favorite bands of all time. Each song on this album for me is pure bliss, through and through. Poppy yet complex, easy to listen to, and interesting lyrics, all combine together to form a band that is certain not to dissapoint. <br />Highly recommended
B00005RFVL|5.0|Great easy listening but do yourself a favor buy the Live At Albert Hall DVD. It's awesome! Also buy the What We Did Last Summer DVD - the Knebworth gig!...Just another side of Robert that'll make you appreciate his talent even more. PLUS FOR FANS: See him in the movie De-Lovely starting the weekend. USA is behind the times. He needs to be embraced as a performer. COME ON!!!
B000002L3P|3.0|I didn't care too much for this album, i'd rather listen to SRV than KWS... his playing definitely shows his SRV influence... but when it comes to the blues you'd be better off checking out Rory Gallagher, Kim Simmonds + Savoy Brown, Buddy Guy's Stone Crazy album... there are much better blues albums out there with better playing and vocalists... so i wouldn't start here.  <BR>and hey logan... this cd was, i believe, released in '95... and Yellow Ledbetter, by Pearl Jam was written in either '91 or '92, which means Pearl Jam didn't rip off KWS...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It took me a couple of episodes to get into it, but then I couldn't get enough and finished the rest of the series far too quickly.  This is yet another excellent Joss Whedon creation, and yet another great show that Fox stupidly cancelled without regard. I'm one of the many that hope to see Firefly renewed on TV after the movie is completed.
B0000W3YIS|5.0|THIS CD is SIMPLY GREAT. Of course like most CDs It does have 1 or 2 poor tracks like SHOWDOWN and ME AGAINST THE MUSIC(REMIX).  <BR>OVERALL it is creative embracing different styles. The 2 bonus tracks are great (DON'T HANG UP being the better one). TOXIC is the best track. The best are the following:<BR>ME AGAINST THE MUSIC<BR>I GOT THAT BOOM BOOM<BR>BREATHE ON ME<BR>EARLY MORNIN'<BR>TOXIC<BR>OUTRAGEOUS<BR>TOUCH OF MY HAND<BR>EVERYTIME<BR>THE ANSWER<BR>DON'T HANG UP<BR>The following are the NOT-SO good tracks:<br />SHOWDOWN<BR>THE HOOK UP<BR>SHADOW<BR>BRAVE NEW GIRL<BR>REMIX of ME AGAINST THE MUSIC <BR>well that's all I have to say, This CD is one of my fav's GET IT IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Her style of writing is has chabnged a bit, all her songs sound diferent, and there all really fun! heres a review:<br />Take me Away-4 stars, cool song! It's like a heavy pop style song<br />Dont tell me-3 stars, It doesnt really strike my fancy, but it has it's own sounds and  stuff<br />Don't tell me-4 stars 1/2, It's cool. Im sure loads of people know that song (website, MTV)<br />He Wasnt-4 stars 1/2. I reeeeeeeallly like this song, has a few lyrics that dont make sense at all, but still cool, with a continous rythym pop, thingy.<br />How does It feel-3 stars 1/2, kinda, slow song, but not exgerated either<br />My Happy Ending- 4 stars 3/4.  It's a fun song, the lyricsgo well toguether too.<br />Nobody's Home-4 stars 1/2, it's the only song thats not about her and her love life...besides how does it feel<br />Forgotten-2 stars. It has more &quot;yeah's&quot; than normal words. The only thing thats cool is the melody<br />Who Know's-5 stars!! Really fun, the melody is cool too.<br />Fall to Pieces-4 stars 1/2. slow but not that slow either. The lyrics are nice, it goes good with the melody.<br />Freak Out-5 Stars! The lyrics is what caught me, of course, the melody in the chorus is really really.<br />Slipped Away-3 stars. I personally dont like it that much, but it's dedicated for her grandfather, so she had to put some feeling into it.<br />Almost all the songs are about her love life, how many boyfriends does she have in two years? But it doesnt matter.
B00013RC9I|5.0|First off. I'm listening to this CD right now on my computer. So the poster below isn't entirely correct...<br />I first heard Air on the Lost in Translation soundtrack. Alone In kyoto was such an amazing song that I ordered this CD and Moon Safari, and I'm definately not dissapointed.<br />Standout tracks:<br />Venus, Cherry Blossom Girl, run, Another Day, Alpha Beta Gaga and Alone in Kyoto.<br />That's 6 excellent songs, a true rarity when buying a CD these days. I can't tell you the number of times I've bought a CD and there were only 1-2 listenable songs. So sad.<br />As far as comparisons to other artists today, I've heard them contrasted with zero7, but I think they are much more original and better songwriters by far. Hell their lirics are pretty basic and non sensicial, it's the complex melodies that distinguish Air above their apparently tone deaf competition.<br />I hope they keep putting out CDs.
B00008QSA5|5.0|This is great stuff man. i'm really into blues-rock stuff like BLUES IMAGE, or ALLMAN BROS. BAND. This is great blues. good guitar. good organ. good vibe. rock. mike bloomfield plays a great guitar, and stephen stills fills in great on guitar and vocals. al kooper is classic. fantastic! rock it, in the pocket buddy!
B000089RVX|3.0|I only liked a few songs on here. I think that they are VERY VERY disturbing. They are even some what creepy. Amy Lee's amazing voice doesn't even do the album justice. I thought that they were supposed to be at least some what christian and from what i can see there is only one song that is anything like christian at all. I personally will not be buying there second release.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This film is not for everyone and that is OK.  I think most people should see it and form their own opinion on the movie itself regardless of what others are saying.  My favorite part of the movie is that is a realistic portrayl of life unlike 90% of the movies made.  I have a hard time connecting with movies that I have nothing in common with.  Most movies always have a happy ending where a love relationship is formed in two days, the good looking hero beats the ugly villan, and rarely am I able to connect and honestly feel moved about it.  There is nothing wrong with that formula, but there is not enough balance in movies today.  This movie has incredible cimematography, there is just enough subtle humor for me at least, and the acting is great.  Also, the filmmaker captured the emotion of the actors which doesn't happen in enough movies.  When I say it is realistic, I mean that this could happen to a lot of people in their daily life.  This is just a glimpse of two different people's lives meeting and what happens in that brief period of time.  Most movies would turn it into a wild love affair or have the two characters spend the rest of their lives together.  This shows a story that has a much better chance of being something the viewer could experience.  This movie isn't Indepence Day, Forest Gump, or the Fast and Furious, but rather one that stands on its own as being a good film.  You'll either love it or hate it, but I think it is always positive when art evokes such a strong reaction and thats where this movie succeds.  If you like this movie, check out In the Mood for Love, it inspired this movie.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is just a way-cool movie... <br />It's a fair amount different than most of his other movies - I'd say Castle in the Sky is probably the closest.<br />The artwork is astounding - AMAZING details in the drawings - I wish I had a HiDef TV and a HiDef transfer, but hey, atleast I've got this great DVD!<br />It's a great movie and if you like anime, this is one you should own.
0316168815|4.0|Susie Salmon is 14, lives with her parents, brother and sister in a middle-class house, does fine in school and has just been kissed for the first time. Everything is fine, but then, out of the blue, she is murdered by a man who lives 2 houses away. He destroys the scene of the crime, hides part of her belongings and dumps het body in a sinkhole. And even though people suspect him of the murder, there is no actual proof.<br />The interesting viewpoint of the book is that we witness everything through the eyes of Susie, wo is in her heaven observing what is happening to her family and friends on earth. How each of them copes in his or her own way with her absence and their grief, how her family disintegrates and gets back together and how life goes on, even though it has changed for a lot of people.<br />I absolutely loved this way of looking at things: it gives the author endless opportunities to describe what is going on when a group of people loose a dear one. I was only disappointed by the rather unbelievable ending of the book, it seemed like the author did not know how to come up with a satisfying ending. A shame and therefore only 4 stars, but for the rest definitely a very enjoyable read.
B000050X31|5.0|I am a long time magic flute lover, who has heard or owned most of the major recording out there.  Recently I started buying Mozart opera DVD's as they were good to introduce friends to the operas.  I first bought the recent Davis/Royal Opera version, but found it a very mixed bag, so I decided to go for this one since Kurt Moll was always my favorite Sarastro on record and he sings the part here (The Sarastro on Davis was very dissapointing).<br />The bad news is that Moll is not in quite as good voice as he was in either his Solti or Davis CD audio only performances. The good news is that he is still magnificent, and this is the best Zauberflote I have ever heard!<br />I never had much respect for James Levine as a conductor. Well that has changed.  For reference, my favorite flute's ever were 1)Christie on Erato 2)Klemperer on EMI 3)Beecham on EMI.  All had there problems, but Christie I found to be the overall best flute I knew including all cast, conducting, acting, and recording.  And it has been replaced by a DVD flute!<br />What I loved about this performance:<br />First of all the conducting is very fine. It is very sharp and disciplined performance with precise singing (litte romantic sliding of notes) and there is, best of all, a wonderful sense of listening between all the singers and the orcherstra. It was obviously meticulously rehearsed for the 1991 Mozart celebrations.  Mozart is the most difficult music to perform because you cannot get away with any emotional sloppiness, which means a luminous precision is always called for.  This performance has this quality better than any other I know.<br />There are some weak bits in my opinion however. A few of the arias really drag their feet in a failed attempt for the conductor and singer to find the right inspiration.  As much as I like Moll, I find his arias too slowly sung, as well as the Isis and Osiris chorale.  Fortunately they still are very effective due to Moll's maginificent voice and the solemn nature of the music itself.<br />Also, occasionally things can be a bit brisk to let the music breathe properly. Overall however, I would give this flute the best marks for conducting.<br />The singing/acting also has no weak links and many outstanding aspects.<br />Ariaza's Tamino is merely good--at his best with the speaker, and worst in final union music with Pamina.  After the first trial he slightly misses a key timing, which when sung perfectly (hear Blochwitz on Christie) is one of the most sublime moments in the score.  Still, this is a good, solid Tamino--well acted, suitably noble if a bit too old. Overall:B-<br />The three ladies are some of the most delightful I've heard. The 2nd has a slightly grating tone, but their timing, harmoninzing, and accuracy puts them right at the top. A-<br />Papageno is solid if rather a bit overdone. Hemm has a lusty, solid bavarian baritone which suits the part in my opinion. It is not a radiantly beautiful voice (hear Keenlyside on Davis), but solid and powerful.  Many papageno's have been more charming, but Hemm is still good, and very find in ensembles. B<br />Serra's Queen is up near my all time favorites: Popp on Klemperer, Dessay on Christie, Damrau on Davis. She rather lacks warmth however, which puts her slightly below these on the first aria. The 2nd is as good as anyone. A-<br />Battle's Pamina is my favorite ever. I feel it was this sort of voice Mozart had in mind for the part--a radiant soprano. Battle's interpretive insights have often left me cold before, but I find her Pamina just spot on. She plays it with a Tempest Miranda sort of innocence and wornder. I find this suits Pamina exactly. A+<br />Monostatos is also the best I have ever heard. Singers tend to make him rather bland for some reason, but this singer gives him oodles of dramatic force. A+<br />Boys are superb. Their trio with battle's Pamina is the finest I have known as well. One boy in particular has amazing power and accuracy. A<br />Sarastrois Moll not in his best voice, but it is still Moll. A<br />Choir.  Big American heavy vibrato style. Not my cup of tea, but more importantly the choral pieces are sung with genuine Masonic fervor that makes them satisfying regardless. B<br />Speaker. Andreas Schmidt is as fine here as I have ever heard him. Wonderful warmth and force. A<br />This is getting too long! While there is much in this performance that I still can imagine better, in overall quality this is by some margin the best performance I have heard or seen of this opera.  Certainly those who love particular parts more than others will find other performances superior (Tamino lovers for instance will always treasure Wunderlich/Bohm), but if you love every note of this opera as well as its Masonic themes, I would give this the top recommendation.<br />O, A+ english subtitles too.  Video,sound and production are good, though not the best in my opinion.  Overall the production has a sort of childish artistic style to it, which I thought was fine.  But then Im mostly here for the music.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I've been reading in the tabloids about how Slipknot has &quot;sold out&quot;.  Well, let me tell you this: Slipknot hasn't sold out.  Just because they release an album that is not death metal or full the explicit lyics doesn't mean that they have lost touch with thier metal side.  If you remember their S/T album back in '99 they had a meldoic song in &quot;Prosthetics&quot; similiar to that of &quot;Vermilion&quot;.  First three songs were outstanding even their single &quot;Duality&quot; is an instant classic.  They debuted at #2 on Billboard for a reason and this is that reason in this album.  You know that you are an outstanding band when you get to preform on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;.  They've come the distance and this is their reward a top selling album.
B00006DEF9|5.0|I fell in love with this film when I was seven years old; I watched it on a B&amp;W television on &quot;The Early Show&quot; in NY (circa 1957 or 1958).  I didn't know who any of the stars were - it didn't matter.  It was magic to me.  From the Hollywood opening (dignity, always dignity), the romp of the elocution lessons (Moses supposes his toes are roses!), and the trial and mostly error of trying to record the sound (&quot;I can't make love to a BUSH!&quot;) when the gorgeous leading lady has a voice that rivals nails on a blackboard, all the way to the grown man dancing in the rain and the final rising curtain - pure magic. In glorious black and white - at the time, I didn't even know it HAD colour!  I decided then and there, this was my absolute all-time favourite movie.  (One of the highlights of my adult life was seeing this wonder on a full, big screen at a revival in the 1970s.) I have seen many films since then; I have reviewed them for friends &amp; family, written reviews for a monthly entertainment publication.  I have an extensive collection of my own (VHS &amp; DVD).  I know a lot more about films and production values now.<br />&quot;Singin'in the Rain&quot; remains my all-time favourite film.  (No surprise, this.)  It's not just another one of &quot;those MGM musicals.&quot;  It was released in 1952. Dated stuff?  Not a bit. Unlike the marvelous &quot;An American in Paris,&quot; which was done as a contemporary film to its time, &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; is a  period film, and it's based in fact.<br />This film (which started out to be a western for Howard Keel) takes a fond and loving look at the birthpains of the sound film (the &quot;talkies).  Set in 1927, with authentic equipment from MGM's own history (Debbie Reynolds drives Andy Hardy's old jalopy, the microphones are real), it details the frantic efforts to get on the sound bandwagon - no one was completely sure of the new technology.  What makes the plot classic is the basis in fact.Many silent stars had totally unacceptable voices or speech (too nasal, unintelligible foreign accents, too high, too low, etc.) for sound production.  The songs used were true to the period.<br />Then we have the performers.  Jean Hagen was nominated for an Academy Award for her role of Lina Lamont.  The character (whose voice you don't hear for the first 10+ minutes of the film, although she's on-screen) is a one-of-a-kind.  [Side note: the voice dubbing Lina's line is actually Hagen's normal voice, not that of Debbie Reynold's Kathy Selden.]  Reynolds does an admirable job - it couldn't have been easy keeping up with her two male co-stars.  It's still a joy to see Donald O'Connor's &quot;Make 'em Laugh,&quot; and wonderful to see Gene Kelly teamed with a good male partner for &quot;Fit as a Fiddle&quot; and &quot;Moses&quot;.  Gene Kelly is, and always shall be, the best and this was done at his peak.<br />Of course, for anyone who has been living in the back of a cave under a rock (or too young to appreciate it), the title number is a delight.  It looks like one continuous take, it is so smooth.  This was not the first appearance of the song, but it's the one we all remember. The sheer exuberance of Kelly's performance carries us right along with him.  <br />The extras with this set are valued items for anyone like me who is interested in the backstory of the era and this film in particular.  And don't fuss for a widescreen version.  This is the way it was.  And now it always will be.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This movie taught me some valuable lessons. Don't believe that awards only go to the truly deserving. And that is probably more true of the Academy Awards than any other. I know that the other screenwriters whose works were up against this one had to be shaking their collective heads. There could not have been a screenplay here unless it was one that only consisted of camera angles, because there is no story here. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson do a commendable job with nothing to work with. As another reviewer said, turn it off after the first 5-10 minutes- you've seen the best of the movie in that time. The second lesson learned was never, ever buy a movie like this without renting it first. I wish I had heeded that advice myself.
B00006NSGX|5.0|The sound quality of this cd will really allow you to hear Clapton at his finest. On just about any sound system that i've played this cd, it sounds amazing. Better than any other cd I own. I found that the versions of River of tears, Reptile, and My Father's eyes are excellent. In fact just about every song on this cd is excellent! Even if you're not the bigget Clapton fan you should still buy it just for the sound quality. Plus, I find that this CD is one of Clapton's best CD's. I would rate it at the top along with his unplugged CD. Buy this CD, I know you'll enjoy it!
B0001MDP3G|2.0|This is a totally disappointing movie.  With all this talent, much might be expected.  But everyone is just going through the motions.  The two principals are incredibly listless (as though they kept thinking &quot;Why on earth am I in this movie?&quot;); only Renee Zellweger has any energy, in a dramatically unrewarding part.  This movie lacks heart.  That the two principals are not going to live happily ever after is completely predictable.  And frankly who cares?
0875428940|5.0|The Robin Wood is a very popular deck and rightly so, it is a fully realized Tarot. The drawing has a very high level of technical skill, a quality I appreciate. Personally I think it outshines both the Waite and the Thoth in this area. At the same time it is a rather pretty deck with a decidedly feminine voice.<br />One should be careful however not to overlook the depth of the symbolism, at first I did. Take the Queen of Swords, The Mail of her helm, speaks to a guarded figure. While her extended left hand is open to accept intuitive knowledge. Her veil, her cloak, the flowers at her feet, and the clouds all have symbolic significance. My point is this is not a deck someone just sat down and drew up. Every aspect of the drawing, the details, the color, the juxtaposition, has been considered and executed. All these details are explained in Robins book on the deck. Ultimately Robin has gifted us readers with a deck as rich in symbolic meaning as any you could hope to study, and its a joy to behold.<br />The Rider Waite has basically become the Standard Tarot if you look at the literature. Nearly every book on reading uses this deck as the touchstone. Unfortunately its just bug ugly.<br />What Robin has done is give us a beautiful deck that is in every important way true to the Rider Waite. The 6 of Swords represents life's rites of passage. The King of Swords is life's Tax Collector. The art however is far more beautiful than the Waite deck, and in most all instances deeper in its meaning. A very nice deck for beginners, that will not go stale as you become a more advanced reader. Believe me you want this deck.

B0001ZX0PG|3.0|Director Clint Eastwood made the correct decision in Mystic River to closely follow the vision and story portrayed in the best selling novel by local Boston writer Dennis Lehane.  In doing so that meant shooting the film on the mean streets of lower middle class Boston, where the struggles of those depicted contained a ringing relevance.  The script by Brian Helgeland follows Lehane's story closely.<br />The story reveals activities of three Boston men from youth to adulthood at around age 40.  Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins were neighborhood youngsters engaging in the traditional youthful mischief of carving their names in fresh sidewalk cement.  A car stops when they are in the midst of their endeavors.  One of the two men jumps out of the car, falsely identifying himself as a policeman and, after berating them for defacing public property, harshly orders one of them into the car.  The car departs with the two friends watching helplessly.  <br />The years pass and they meet again under anything but auspicious circumstances.  Tim Robbins, the victim of child molestation by the two criminals who abducted him, has trouble adjusting, haunted by the event.  He drinks a lot to still his nerves as well as forget, but instead of forgetting the visions become more vivid,  He talks morbidly about wolves in the woods.  Sean Penn, after a stretch in prison, runs a small market, barely able to make ends meet.  Kevin Bacon is a Boston police detective.<br />When Penn's daughter turns up dead all the old scars from the past are reopened.  Robbins has been involved in a violent incident the same night that Penn's daughter was killed, leading Penn as well as others, including Robbins's wife, Marcia Gay Harden, to suspect him.  When he tells contradictory stories suspicions naturally multiply.  Penn has two local underworld thugs investigate possible Robbins involvement.<br />Kevin Bacon is a man caught in the middle, remembering his old friend Robbins from their respectiveyouths, and his partner Laurence Fishburne is compelled to pressure him to take a long, hard look at Robbins as a suspect.  Eventually Fishburne hauls Robbins in for questioning with tormented Bacon assisting in the process.   <br />The Mystic River holds the key as bodies are dumped there.  These bodies reveal crimes and motivations that will unlock the ultimate mystery of the murder of Penn's daughter.  As Robbins's case is investigated further doubt emerges as to whether he or somebody else killed Penn's daughter.  Secrets from Penn's dark past are also uncovered.  <br />The picture ends in a deliberately ambiguous mode, letting viewers fill in a murky picture emerging from equally murky circumstances.  The ending dovetails with Lehane's hard-hitting novel.  This is Boston in its toughest blue collar mode.
B0001ZX0OW|1.0|Here's another run at the badness of this movie.  Warning, will blow whole plot.  This review is intended for people who have seen this trash and are trying desperately to reassure themselves that they are not alone in hating it.<br />Tim Robbin's character, Dave Boyle, was raped by men as a child.  Since then he has lived his life as best he can, apparently.  He is a devoted husband and father.  On the night that Sean Penn's character's daughter is murdered, Boyle has the bad luck to murder a pedophile right at the same time and to behave cagily accordingly.  Thereupon he is mistaken by lots of people for Penn's daughter's murderer and is eventually executed by Penn.  When it becomes known that he is not the killer, that he did in fact kill a pedophile who was in the process of sexing-up a young boy, the general consensus is, \\"Ahh, well, its for the best anyway\\"  the idea being that since he was raped as a child he's pretty much better off dead.  As one character puts it, \\"Looks like damaged goods to me.\\"  And as Sean Penn's character figuratively says, \\"The last time I saw Dave Boyle?  It was (before he was molested as a child).\\"  So, do you see why I loathe this flick on a variety of levels?  Do you?  It is not enough for the flick to contain bad acting, bad writing, bad directing, bad continuity... the picture also is morally vile:  it is a message movie, the basic message of which is, \\"If you were molested as a child, do everyone a favor and put a bullet in your head.  You're finished.  Gee, that's real inspiring.

B0001AVZA8|3.0|Something had to give eventually for this movie to finally end. It kind of took forever to get it to end it ran about 30 minutes to late. I still thought it was a funny smart romantic comedy about older people but I truly think that Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton didn't need the sex scenes to get this movie passed. I think these two people have chemistry when they talk but when they are making out I get stomach cramps especially that part where Nicholson cuts Keaton's turtleneck off with a scissor and begins to desire her I just think these look really bad in bed together. This movie was decent though because It had a feel good feeling to it. I feel though that at the beginning the movie was off to much more but by the middle of it the film slowed down and got a little mellow for not just me but for alot of people. But I would see it again.
B00018D44U|5.0|I have been a Norah Jones fan since I first heard &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;. But I did not really care for &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; - at first. But I kept playing it, and the more I played it the more hooked I got. The first 5 tracks are &quot;OK&quot;. But this Album really starts with track 6. From there on it's fantastic. Tracks 6 thru 11 are worth the price (Full MSRP even) of this CD. Quite often I start with 6 and play it 3 or 4 times in a row and then let the CD finish out. I have read most of the reviews, critics and fans and even if this was the work of great &quot;handling&quot; so what? Norah is just wonderful, new , fresh, a great change from the &quot;Other&quot; female artists out there. I hope she does another DVD and doesn't just sit behind the mic.<br />With the advanced electronics available today they could have done a better job on her Video from the house of blues. But then that's another item. As for this one, if you don't own it, buy it. If you do, buy a second and put it away for when you wear out the one you use. Norah should have a very long and wonderful music life ahead. Let's hope she can go on forever.

B0000VCZK2|5.0|The Alien Quadrilogy [2003] is perhaps the best illustration of how DVD technology has consigned VHS to the dustbin of home entertainment history.  This beautifully packaged boxed set is a splendid illustration of the capabilities of the DVD medium and certainly contains everything you ever wanted to know about Alien - and then some.<br />The 9 DVDs comprise both the original theatrical releases and extended director's cuts of all 4 movies.  Audio and visuals have been tweaked to a noticeable degree to optimise home enjoyment. If you don't already possess a surround-sound system - buy one now!<br />The documentary disks accompanying each movie are crammed full of fascinating material - storyboards, backstage candid shots and tons of insightful and amusing interviews with the directors, producers, actors etc. One of the highlights for me  being the Aliens 3 supplemental disk, which recounts the amazing story of the abortive &quot;wooden monastery&quot; first draft and the huge problems that beset the third installment.  I wonder if one of the proposed taglines for another draft of Alien 3 - &quot;On Earth *everyone* can hear you scream&quot; may yet be used for a 5th movie?  Also, seeing the legendary H.R. Giger at work in his bone-filled mausoleum of a studio was truly captivating.<br />Everyone is familiar with the movies themselves, so just a few brief words will suffice on each;<br />Alien: a sublime and seminal blend of intelligent sci-fi and gothic horror.

I prefer the theatrical release, as the extended version lacks a little pace in the denouement due to superfluous scenes - 10/10.<br />Aliens: Not quite the stunning claustrophobic impact of the first movie, but the breathless action easily compensates. Go for the special edition here for the more meaningful intro and the poignant scene where Ripley finds out about her daughter - 10/10.<br />Alien 3: Director's cut is *FAR* superior here - why the abbatoir scene and the nascent &quot;bambi&quot; alien were cut from the theatrical version is truly baffling. The strongest characterisation and human interest of the entire series, although the ending appears somewhat rushed and is not entirely satisfactory - 8/10.<br />Alien Resurrection: Generally held to be the weakest of the series (I agree), Jeunet dilutes the alien impact with some whimsical direction and downright annoying characterisation. In places Alien 4 descends, disappointingly, into black comedy. Cult actor Ron Perlman is great though and the alien effects are excellent. Stick with the slicker theatrical version - 6/10.<br />So, whilst I am not a great fan of the 4th installment, this collection, especially now at this bargain price, undeniably represents excellent value for money and is an indispensible purchase for the serious sci-fi fan.

B00000273M|4.0|What can you say about the Bangles that hasn't been said a thousand times?  I dunno.  I do know that they certainly outdid themselves in the 80's.  They say &quot;They won't feel bad at all/When the hero takes a fall&quot;, and they're &quot;Going down to Liverpool to do nothing all the days of their lives&quot; which I don't think makes a whole lot of sense.  I like &quot;Manic Monday&quot;.  It's a good song.  &quot;If She Knew What She Wants&quot; is certainly nice.  Both are rather mellow tunes.<br />Garage rock they may be, but that doesn't neccessarily mean hard rock.  Not all their songs rock hard, thank God, because I'm not into hard rock.<br />Now from what I understand, &quot;Eternal Flame&quot; ruined the Bangles.  I don't think the song's all that bad.  It's just one of those rare torch songs (which hit #1), it's rather sad and it just makes you stop to think once in a while.  Hearing &quot;Eternal Flame&quot; makes me want a girlfriend.  I can't hear the song without it sticking in my head, in fact I can't hear most Bangles songs without them sticking in my head.  &quot;Manic Monday&quot;, &quot;If She Knew What She Wants&quot;, they stick in my head for a long while.  Even &quot;Walk Like An Egyptian&quot; is difficult to get out of my head.<br />I never heard of the Bangles until 2002, less than 3 weeks before Christmas.  I saw the look Susanna Hoffs gave on &quot;Walk Like An Egyptian&quot;.  I was completely freaked out.  I couldn't believe what I was seeing!<br />In October 2003, I ended up buying their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; collection.  I just couldn't take it anymore, it was eating me up inside.  I wanted to hear what those girls could do.  And it's excellent.  I just didn't think their songs would be so hard to get out of my head, but they were.  Still could be.  I haven't listened to them in a long while.  Listening to my favorite singers (James Taylor, Paul Simon) didn't do any good.  I still had Bangles tunes stuck in my head.<br />I likethat rather downbeat song, &quot;Following&quot;. It's my favorite Bangles song not lead by Susanna Hoffs.  The song is just mostly Michael Steele (bassist) throughout the whole song.  She just picks up a guitar and plays the song.  That song has to be the mother of all downbeat songs.  It is REALLY downbeat.  Most Bangles tunes tend to be rather upbeat, but &quot;Following&quot; is very downbeat.  &quot;Why do you call me?/Why do you look for me?/Why do your eyes follow me the way they do?&quot; Michael sings.  In the song, it sounds like she's accusing her boyfriend of being obsessed.  He follows her around all the time and he just can't concentrate on anything else.<br />Just like I said, it's a rather downbeat song.  Probably the most downbeat song recorded in the history of music, even today it still is.  Michael Steele really outdid herself with &quot;Following&quot;.  And yes, that too, is hard to get out of my head.  Most Bangles tunes are.
B00003CXA6|4.0|I liked this movie very much, but yet I do believe that if it were made at the same time Gods and Generals was, it would have been a much better film. I thought that Sheen did a fair job at playing the great General Robert E. Lee, but he is no match for the outstanding performance of Robert Duvall. I like Tom Berenger as General Longstreet, who was also from my native state, South Carolina. Jeff Danials did a spectacular job in this film as Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain in Gettysburg as well in Gods and Generals. The effort these actors put in to this movie are so dramatic, it takes your breath away to see these men, in fact, you don't see Martin Sheen, Tom Berenger, or Jeff Danials, you see Robert E. Lee, Jamse Longstreet, and Joshua Chamberlain. But I must say, if you are going to watch Gettysburg, you mite want to watch Gods and Generals first.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Who would have  thought that, after nearly 30 years, the world's goofiest movie could be made even moreso?  Not only is this DVD a comedy triumph (it would be simply if it were the DVD version of the classic film, in which a crew too broke to afford horses for King Arthur and his Knights changed history and college kids' banter forever by introducing coconuts as migrating props). Oh, no, this DVD is one that may become a standard for other DVDs.  Just look at this list of extras above!  To be sure, some of them are fluff.  The &quot;load of rubbish&quot; selection is simply some receipts and a few odd notes.  But most of it is stupendous.<br />The first disc contains the movie itself, along with some choices of how to watch it.... subtitles, commentary by directors Terry Jones &amp; Terry Gilliam or by John Cleese &amp; Eric Idle &amp; Michael Palin. Then &quot;for people who don't like the film&quot;, there's subtitles from Shakespeare's &quot;Henry IV, Part II&quot;.  Now, these  do not faithfully follow Henry IV verse by verse, but they do come from the play, and it's hilarious how the phrases Shakespeare wrote do actually match up with the action on the screen.<br />Disc Two contains several mementoes:  a film of John Cleese, Terry Jones, and &quot;Grail&quot; production manager John Young (who also played the hapless &quot;Historian&quot; towards the end of the film, and the &quot;I'm not dead!&quot; guy) paying a return visit to Castle Doune , in 2000.  At first it's fun to hear them reminisce at the filming site, but since it's a very small spot with nothing but a wall and a bit of ground, they appear uncomfortable and that  quickly gets old. More interesting is the home movie made by the two Terries when they looked for prospective film locations in the seventies. Their excitement is palpable.<br />A somewhat painful scene (except for the chance it gives us to watch Terry Jones in action as a director) is the BBC documentary made during filming. The interviewer seems more interested in trying to be funny himself than in the Pythons.  But there are several great comic extras, including words to some songs, a coconut skit, two scenes dubbed in Japanese, and best of all, an animated feature of the &quot;Camelot&quot; scene and song done entirely in Lego...must be seen to be believed.<br />Finally, someone has made good use of the storage space on a DVD.rviewer seems more interested in trying to be funny himself than in the Pythons.

B00005JMFQ|2.0|After all the gushy reviews for this movie, I couldn't wait to rent a copy.  I like gushy, feel-good movies, and that's what this movie purported itself to be.  When it was over and the credits began to roll, I found myself sort of lost in confusion, which I abruptly ended with a \\"hmmph...\\" and a shrug.  This is a completely British movie, and maybe it makes more sense to Brits.  After watching this movie I have deduced that it takes two things to tickle an Englishperson's ribs: a lot of cussing, and a lot of sex.  For me, the cussing was way overdone, and it actually weighed down what is supposed to be a light storyline.  There was also too many mini-plots squeezed into one film.  I kept thinking at the end that they would all somehow tie together, and some did, but that only left me wondering about the ones that were left hanging...for example, Laura Linney's pathetic character, who spends much of her time pining and primping for a colleague, then when she finally gets her chance with him, she can't seem to stop taking cell calls from her mentally ill brother (by the way, no mental institution is going to give a patient that much free will with a phone).  Each time I hoped she would reach for the \\"off\\" button on her phone, she instead answered it with a cheery \\"Hi babe!\\".  Emma Thompson's character also came off as quite pathetic, as she copes with her lukewarm marriage to a middle-aged man with a young nympho for a secretary.  I kept hoping that her marriage would be made better somehow by the crisis, but it never was.  The goofy, horny, US-bound waiter was just, well, goofy.  He didn't really add anything to the movie.  Hugh Grant seemed like he was attempting to star in \\"Notting Hill, Part Two\\".  His stuffy \\"romance\\" with his 20-year younger hostess was rather cold.  So, what did make this movie worth a star?  The storylines involving Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, and the young man who was desperately in love with his best friend's new wife.  Everyone, and everything, else was utterly forgettable, and only served as distractions.  The intermittent blips of soft-core porn were just icky.  What made this movie worth its second star?  It gave me something to do while I was doing laundry.
B0002I831S|5.0|The original Star Trek, despite the notoriously cheesy sets and hammy acting by William Shatner, is a true classic SF series not just for the obvious reasons (becoming part of our pop culture heritage, spawning a huge TV and film franchise, etc.). It's classic because it was always boldly trying new things, with real SF writers like Harlan Ellison taking it where other shows hadn't gone before. You never knew what would come with each new episode. Some episodes fell flat, naturally, but many became genre classics that really stick with you for years. <br />After the original series, Star Trek took a horribly wrong turn with the later series, beginning a long slide into mediocrity and irrelevance, while upstart shows like Babylon 5 totally eclipsed the Trek franchise where smart, cutting-edge SF was concerned. The whole Trek franchise became oppressively formulaic and derivative of itself, focusing on fleshing out the \\"Star Trek universe\\" instead of on character and story. Who on earth cares about tachyons and warp cores or how fast a Borg cube is? It's all trivia instead of substance. If you only know Trek from Enterprise, Deep Space 9, The Next Generation, or--God forbid--the pathetic Voyager, check out the original series to see Trek when it was groundbreaking and great.

B00005AQE8|5.0|This album (and the How Do U Want It megasingle) made Pac the pre-eminent name in rap and solidified his status as one of the greatest and most successful music artists of all time.  <br />&quot;I won't deny it...&quot;  With that line, Pac starts the album, and with that line I start my caveat.  I won't deny it, this album is unquestionably a 5 star, rap's first double album of original material, and one of the greatest albums period.  However, it's also overrated by diehard Pac fans who won't look past its imperfections.  <br />Nobody could have made a double CD this good, but the album still has filler tracks on it, something that just plain did not happen on any other Pac album while he was alive.  And while fillers like Whatz Ya Phone # and Aint Hard 2 Find are still decent tracks, they're not Pac quality.  <br />There are plenty of tracks like Ambitionz, I Aint Mad, Life Goes On etc. to make this an obvious must-buy album.  But Makaveli and Me Against The World were both better albums.
B00006ADFL|5.0|It still amazes me how Peter Jackson went on to direct three of the greatest epics in the form of &quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot; that grossed a combined total of $3 billion worldwide when some six years previously directed low-budget films such as &quot;Heavenly Creatures.&quot; They say the best things happen by accident (or is that just me?) and just two and a half hours ago I was flicking through the channels, looking for something to watch when I stumbled amongst Heavenly Creatures. Dubbed by my TV guide as an 'intense and atmospheric treat,' I decided to sit and watch it, if not only for the adorable Kate Winslet. By the end I was convinced I had just watched one of the best films I have seen in years!<br />In 1954 two girls brutally murdered one of their mothers in what still remains, to this day, perhaps the most documented and sensational murders in New Zealand's history. &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; tells the true story of this crime drama and highlights their strange friendship. If you think before you watch this that you're just in for another stereotypical blood-splatter flick then you are very much mistaken.<br />Pauline Rieper (Melanie Lynskey) is a typical student in a strict all-girls' school who is completely bowled over when Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet) joins her school and tears up her pathetic existence into something radical and fresh. They have similar interests such as the arts, sculpture, English and the tenor Mario Lanza. Eventually both the romance and the frightfulness of it all reaches a tragic conclusion. In their all consuming friendship Juliet and Pauline create a &quot;Fourth World,&quot; better than heaven (because it has no Christians), inhabited by the clay figures they have fashioned to represents their friends and where the music of Mario Lanza, the greatest tenor on earth, is always in the air.<br />The two girls' emotional attachment has turned incredibly intense, so that they barely think of anyone but each other, and the fantasy stories begin to seep into reality for them. Not even a four-month stint in hospital for Juliet can keep Pauline away. Pauline drops out of school and stops talking to her parents; Juliet learns that her mother is sleeping with one of her clients, and that her parents are divorcing. Now she's being sent to South Africa, and there is no telling when she will see Pauline again. Unless they do something about their parents so that they can stay together...such as murder.<br />Watching the film I felt a continual underbelly of lesbianism playing a major role. These suggestions are continually squashed, however, due to the times the movie is set in where homosexuality is an 'unnatural' subject. Kate Winslet is superb as the bright and luminous Juliet and with her posh accent, she brings a certain level of humor to the film that would have been impossible without her. Melanie Lynskey portrays Pauline superbly too, contrasting from the mature attitude of a fully grown woman to the sly grin of an evil teenage girl who knows too much. The films comedy moment can be cheesy at times, but are intentional in their positions in that they counterbalance the horrifying scenes. Many moments pre-horror build up the suspense brilliantly, then perform a sort of anticlimax. However, the peaceful and tranquil music that plays just before the brutal and obscene ending is obviously intentful.<br />The ending is what stays with the viewer most when looking back on the film The way Jackson directed the scene to be something truly spectacular was superbly pulled off. The screams of the mother and the cuts to the alternative-world made me want to cover my eyes in fear, but I persisted and watched through the horror. The dialogue of the film is brilliant, and only Peter Jackson could come up with the idea of life-size clay models that walk and talk. Six years later he'd be making something a lot grander. Richard Taylor supplies the CGI effect and is superb in doing so making for surprisingly life-like, realistic characters - remember, this was 1994!<br />In the end what you have here is a fantastic and timeless film that is perfect for college/University studies both in direction and content. What is most fascinating, apart from the real-life chilling theme that features prominently throughout, is the fact that Peter Jackson went on to become one of the world's most celebrated directors in history, whilst Kate Winslet went on to star in the most successful motion picture of all time! This is a film that will appeal to all generations (obviously not youngsters) of people with a thirst for crime, horror, blood, gore and fantasy. Don't try and ignore it - this film will make your head spin!ingly life-like, realistic characters - remember, this was 1994!<br />In the end what you have here is a fantastic and timeless film that is perfect for college/University studies both in direction and content.

Over the next five years, his style would mature, and his abilities as an MC would improve, but this album and Strictly offered up some of his best storytelling raps and most of his great political commentary tracks.  <br />For someone to consider this debut &quot;mediocre&quot; or &quot;disappointing,&quot; they must not be able to understand the hip hop climate of the late 80s and early 90s, before The Chronic.  Public Enemy, Ice Cube, Ice T etc. all made headlines and splashes with albums that covered the same topics as 2pacalypse.  They must also overlook the fact that Brenda's Got A Baby, Violent, Soulja's Story, If My Homie Calls, Trapped and Part Time Mutha might be the largest and best collection of hood stories ever told in rap form all on one album.<br />If you're looking for the GFunk beats of Chronic or the production on Illmatic and Ready 2 Die, you won't find them here or in any other album in 1991.  With that said, how can anyone claim that these tracks don't have tight beats?  <br />This was an incredible album created by a kid at a young age.
0385484518|5.0|Lacking complicated storylines and superfluous vocabulary, Tuesdays with Morrie is a book about the mystery and confusion affiliated with the subject that we all dread to talk or even think about: death. Not to be confused for a self-help book, Mitch Albom's touching account of a man diagnosed with ALS is sure to evoke tears in even the less-sensitive among us, for what makes the book such a success is its simplicity and lack of pretentiousness. Albom touches upon issues such as family, money, emotions, and fear of aging, simply to name a few, as he tries to understand their importance in life, as well as on the brink of death, through dialogues with his old Brandeis sociology teacher, Morrie Schwartz. <br /> &quot;Only when you learn how to die, you learn how to live,&quot; is the central theme of Albom's masterpiece. The book is not targeted for a specific audience and can be enjoyed by people of all ages in all types of situations. The most wonderful aspect of Tuesdays with Morrie is the questions it naturally evokes in the reader upon completion, especially those concerning the validity of one's life choices. The book strips away all of the meaningless issues that one is exposed to on a day-to-day basis and gets back to the very basics of life, reminding all readers of the importance of family, marriage, genuine happiness, and most importantly, love for others and especially for oneself.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Debuting at number 2 on Billboard, this album has been selling like mad. Why? Because it is Slipknot's best CD to date. Fans of their self-titled, or even Iowa, have complained about the acoustic likes of the songs &quot;Circle&quot; or &quot;Vermilion Pt. 2&quot;. Yes, Slipknot has a reputation for being the &quot;definition&quot; of recent nu-metal because of their hardcore beats and lyrics. BUT what Slipknot has done proved they can experiment and pull it off with imminent success. Besides a few acoustic tracks, Slipknot sticks to their hardcore roots through songs like &quot;The Blister Exists&quot;, &quot;Three Nil&quot;, and &quot;Welcome&quot;. However, Slipknot dishes the hauntingly beautiful acoustic track &quot;Circle&quot; which stands as my favorite on the CD. Implementing the vocal variations of Corey and line of strings gives the song the poignance that could not be otherwise achieved through typical nu-metal sound.<br />The heavy beat/acoustic blend in &quot;The Nameless&quot;, and other otherwise revolutionary tactics used by Slipknot to enhance &quot;The Subliminal Versus&quot; permanently gives them prestige in the music industry. As a fan of their previous work on their self-titled for many years, I accept their not &quot;new&quot;, but more matured music as a demonstration of their unique talent. Every element of the band pulls through blindingly with this CD. You cannot consider yourself a maggot if you do not appreciate what Slipknot has done and pulled off through this CD. Hopefully their next CD will match or rival the likes of &quot;The Subliminal Versus&quot;. They are going to kick a$$ in concert!
B000059XUP|5.0|This movie is the best sequel ever. It has everything a movie needs in order to be perfect. Humor, lots of acton, and great costumes, including a sweet plot make this movie a movie that is worth seeing over and over again. Great!
B00005AQGH|5.0|This album has a polarizing effect on many people, including plenty of Pac's biggest fans.  Some (like me) believe this is the greatest rap album of all time.  Others rate it as middle of the road among just Pac's anthology.  <br />Pac drops the party atmosphere that was constantly portrayed on All Eyez On Me and strictly gets down to business on this album.  What follows was an album that he (miraculously) completed in 7 days, a majority of which was done in 3 days.  <br />This album captures the essence Pac being a living contradition of &quot;thug angel,&quot; a gangsta with an introspective, soft side.  The album is monochromatic, switching from disses and hard tracks right into introspective, soft tracks.  The production on this album is better than All Eyez On Me, peaking of course with Hail Mary, and Pac's lyrical abilities as an MC were improving up to the night of September 7th, 1996.  <br />In addition to the music, there's one other reason this album will forever remain timeless.  With Pac laying extra vocal layers and talking throughout most of the tracks, and some possible additions by Death Row itself, it takes multiple listens to catch every word or hear everything in a track.  There was a debate over the intro of Hail Mary, the intro of Hold Ya Head, and still nobody is sure what's said at the beginning of Bomb First.  This album is mysterious, engrossing, hard and soft all at the same time, without a skip in the album.<br />If All Eyez On Me cemented Pac as a rap god and the biggest name in rap history, the Makaveli CD may have cemented Pac as the greatest rapper of all time.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye is the new sensation bringing back old school beats with new school flow.

B00008RH3L|5.0|The scene in which \\"Danny Boy\\" provides the musical counterpoint (I won't describe the scene in case you have yet to see the movie) wonderfully contrasts the beauty of the song with the horrific, yet gorgeously presented, violence of the scene.  It is the most memorable film scene I have encountered. The version of \\"Danny Boy\\" used is also the best rendition of this sentimental song that I know of.  The DVD extras are wonderful too.   The interview with Sonnenfeld gives a marvellous insight into the work of a cinematographer. If you are a high school teacher like me you will want to show it to your senior film students and let Barry explain what lenses and lighting can do.
0783232039|5.0|Change is really good sometimes. The introduction of the bride of Chucky is awesome, and it really makes the movie more interesting. She is a sweet horror character, much better than the old Chucky.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I can't say that I'm a huge fan of anime (if that even) but I must admit this film is worth its weight in gold!  The story itself is gorgeous, and the animation and music follow.  Princess Mononoke is 5 out of 5 stars!  (P.S. I'd love to buy one of those little white tree spirits, they're sooo cute!)
B000059XUP|5.0|I saw this movie and it is so good and much, much better than the irst one. It has action, a great plot, and very believable costumes. A must see!
B000002B7O|5.0|Oh the good old days.You know back when Ozzy Osbourne was the coolest thing since sliced bread.Every song on here is a classic and dont let the critics fool you the ballads are not sappy at all.On Tonight and You Cant Kill Rock And Roll Ozzy sings like a man deeply in love which he was.He was in love with Sharon and also in love with simple rock and roll.The album starts off with the metallic Over The Mountain which is a great song and ends with the dark &quot;ballad&quot; Diary Of A Madman.Some of the songs on here such as S.A.T.O. and the Alice Cooper esque Little Dolls are criminally underrated.Believer is one of Ozzy's greatest but the best version is on Tribute.Flying High is an ode to marijuana and is still remarkably on the classic rock stations.All in all this is Ozzy Osbourne's best album and showcases some of Randy Rhoads best guitar playing.
0783232039|5.0|I loved this movie, even though I expected it to be scarrier. The good part is that the movie also has some very fun parts and it's interesting. It should not be missed!!
B000063DIR|2.0|You actually still can buy the real version of this album on this site if you look hard enough.This version however is strictly for the die hard Ozzy fan who wants 2 versions.Everyone else should buy the 1995 remaster which features the original musicians.
0780624890|5.0|This is the greatest comic adaptation ever made. It has action, great actors, sript, and well made plot. A must see for all action fans and comic book fans!
B00025ETIW|5.0|Arguably the best disc to come out in years, I haven't listened to anything for one month. Since the day this disc came out, I haven't played anything else in my CD player. The best cD in ages dawg
0783232039|5.0|Cool, this is the neatest Chucky movie. It has love, violence, romance, humor and everything a good movie needs. I really liked it.
B00002MZ2C|1.0|This album is a disaster. It stinks worse than cooking squash. Who cares about these idiot's political views. What's with nu metal and politics. If you don't want to sing about heavy subjects, don't sing at all.
B000059XUP|5.0|The Crow comes back to life and starts killing people. So much fun, go see it!
B000002JNJ|4.0|Most people call this album okay, but cast it in the shadow on Vulgar Display Of Power. But I feel this is one of Pantera's best albums, and is quite underrated. It has a little bit of a power metal sound to it, like some other reviewers said. But it is a lot faster than their later albums, so that makes it sound a little thrashy. My favorite song from the album is 'Cemetary Gates', and I also like 'Cowboys From hell'. The latter song has one of the most memorable riffs of all time in heavy metal. This is just a really good album from a beginning band.
0783232039|5.0|I haven't seen all the Chucky movies, but I am really looking forward to seeing them. This DVD has the entire histry of Chucky and that should help me find out more stuff about the serial killer doll. Anyway, The Bride Of Chucky is a very well-made horror movie.
B0001RVTXO|5.0|This is a great deal and a beautiful CD.  The songs have the power to completely change your mood.  Favorites: \\"Where is My Mind,\\"--sad and gorgeous song!  \\"Monkey's gone to heaven,\\" equally fantastic, \\"Hey.\\"  Anyway, this is pointless--I love just about every song.  Get it and you'll get into it.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|This movie is full of action, love, great views, actors, and everything else a movie needs to be great. Having said that, the only word to describe a movie such as this one is SPECTACULAR!
B000000WZ4|5.0|Ultra is the album that made me revisit Depeche Mode after a hiatus of more than 10 years not listening to their music AT ALL. I used to be a HUGE fan back in the 80s and own every record they released from 1981 to 1990. But after Violator I lost touch with the band; I wasn't too thrilled with Songs of Faith and Devotion back in 1993, and I began listening to other stuff instead... Until I somehow came across Ultra. Am I glad that I did! <br />In Ultra I find again all the elements that made me a Depeche Mode fan back in the 80s: their ability to touch me with the lyrics and the atmospheres created throughout the album, Dave's fantastic voice and interpretation, the beautiful melodies that stick to your head and don't let you go, the musical style so unique to Depeche Mode... There is nothing quite like these guys out there (there never was) and in Ultra they manage to be themselves, but to reinvent themselves so as to not sound the same.<br />I was not aware of all the problems the band went through during the 90s, but knowing now, I am truly amazed that they could pick themselves up and create this beautiful piece of music. As a reviewer said before me, there's not one song that I don't like in this record. And that is something that had never been the case before: even in masterpieces like Black Celebration or Violator there were tracks that didn't do it for me (although that didn't detract from my overall enjoyment of the records). This doesn't happen in Ultra.<br />It can be argued endlessly about this album not being Violator or Black Celebration. Why expect a Violator clone from a band that has always succeeded in sounding different with each album?I can understand if people don't like the particular direction taken by the guys here, but let's not destroy the album &quot;because it is no Violator&quot;. I'd rather value this effort for its own worth, and I think it is one hell of an album: these guys have lived, have progressed as artists and human beings, and this creative growth shows in Ultra.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|Well, I have recently seen this movie and I have to say that it is so good because it has great special effects, a  sweet plot, good actors, and some great views. This is a must see for everyone! LOVED IT!
0446605409|5.0|This is my first book by Nelson DeMille and what a pleasant surprise it was. This is one of the best examples of great mistery novels. It has everything: great suspense, good character development, main character NYC detective John Corey is very likable and could be easily identified with, a lot of humor, etc. It's also quite informative on the some subjects that are related to the plot. If anything, I was a little surprised to read some other reviews saying that the first part of the book was a little boring and the last two pages is where the most action takes place. I actually found first part to be the most suspenful and thought that whole sea adventures didn't need to be covered in so many pages. Still, great mistery novel that is highly recommended to all mistery fans. I am looking forward to other books by this writer.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|Cold mountain is the best movie ever made. It has everything a mmovie needs to have to be totally perfect. I saw it 5 times and I still love it. Go see it!
B0000UHFC6|5.0|I love the movies and love the soundtracks also! Howard Shore is a brilliant composer.  I heard that late this year or in 2005 will be released a BoxSet with 9 CDs of the complete LOTR Movies Soundtracks in Extended Editions. It's a box with the complete soundtracks to all the LOTR Trilogy Movies as seen on screen - Theatrical Versions - YES!  It will be 2 CDs for FOTR, 3 for TT and another 3 for ROTK and an extra CD with rarities and unreleased music from the films with commentary from Howard himself!!  What a BIG surprise!
B0001HLVS2|5.0|This is just the best action movie I have ever seen. It combines realism with very good acting into a dramatic adventure. Really good!
038533558X|4.0|This is the third Harlan Coben novel I've read and it is the best so far. Coben's plots have more twists and turns then a roller coaster. There is a surprise literally every few pages.<br />  And that is the problem. Some of the surprises, many of them in fact, are simply jarring. They are clearly dramatic devices intended to move the story forward and the reader is sometimes forced to deliberately invoke their own sense of credulity.<br />  Fortunately Coben's enough of a storyteller to involve the reader to the point of doing just that.<br />  Coben is a powerful writer. His characters, while lacking depth and believability, are engrossing. The good folks are far and few between, the bad guys and dolls are plentiful and you simply can't be sure of where everyone stands.<br />  The ending of &quot;Gone for Good&quot; is disappointing. Coben has to wrap up too many loose ends and it smacks of a 1930s movie with the detective assembling everyone in the drawing room and lecturing each suspect until revealing the perpetrator. Of course, it doesn't help that the &quot;surprise&quot; at the end is simply too surprising.<br />  All that said, Coben is an immensely gifted writer who clearly has not reached his prime. He's entertaining, pulls you from page to page and is very clearly on the verge of breaking through. I'll be reading his five other novels to see if he's made it there yet.<br />Jerry
B00005JKN9|2.0|This one was a crashing bore. Scorsese put all his energy into fancy sets and flashy camera work and neglected to give us a fresh, interesting story or credible characters. A previous reviewer wondered whether Scorsese is incapable of making films set in times or places not his own. On the evidence of the last 10 or so films Scorsese's made, I'd say...Yep. GoodFellas, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Mean Streets, the first half of Casino--these are all f*cking brilliant! (An exception to the rule is the eminently forgettable Bringing Out the Dead, set in modern NYC.) But his other films--GONY, Kundun, The Age of Innocence--are duds, every single one of them. <br />The DVD is annoying. The movie is spread out over two discs, for no good reason except to drive up the cost. <br />A couple of earlier reviewers here suggested City of God as a good alternative to this disappointing movie. I agree. If you want to see a brilliantly rendered saga about criminal gangs running wild in lawless slums, COG is the movie to get. It was the best film of 2003. Interestingly enough, its structure and narrative style are closely patterned after GoodFellas. Scorsese is being outstripped by his disciples.<br />Upshot: Skip this dud and rent or buy City of God.
B00001OH80|2.0|2 decades ago, david bowie released Tonight, the follow up to his blockbuster classic, 1983's let's dance. But by the time his Let's Dance / Tonight period arose, his songwriting began to slip.<br />Sadly, Tonight equals none of the material on Let's Dance, with the exception of the single &quot;Blue Jean&quot;. Loving the Alien and I Keep Forgettin' come close, but the rest of the album seems unnecessarily moapy compared to the enthusiasm and sonic textures of Let's Dance. Producer Hugh Padgham has a different sound that fits Genesis (and Phil Collins) far more naturally than Bowie. &quot;Neighborhood Threat&quot; for example, feels more like a lost b-side to Genesis' self titled effort in 1983. That's not to say that Let's Dance had some sort of important theme or historical signifance, but the music &quot;seemed&quot; more important. <br />If anything good can be said about it, Tonight is one of Bowie's more interesting albums, like an attempt to limit the size of his audience. <BR>Many critics tossed off Tonight as an album constructed of too many song covers.<br />Only die hard Bowie fans will care to own Tonight. Although it's undoubtedly an influential album for modern punk and industrial crowds, Tonight is really unmemorable, as it presents us with Bowie  in his weakest form.
B000002H33|5.0|This album is simply FANTASTIC all their other albums are not much compared to this.STOP wasting your time and get this AWESOME ALBUM NOW.
B000000WCV|5.0|I really dig this CD because it has one of my favorite techno tracks of all-time on it, &quot;Alive&quot;, which is worth the price of the CD alone. However, extra suspicious Prodigy fans may hate this CD because every track is too repetitive, but isn't every piece of music repetitive in one way or another? Support musicians, especially independent musicians like mr.deviant, and don't trade music on the internet.<br />Oh and as requested, I want to recommend another instrumental CD, a killer instrumental CD, by Mr.Deviant called &quot;Techno Obsession&quot;. It's a killer mix of power rock and hard dance music. Check it out if you don't fear any conspiracies.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Never in my life have I been as shocked and offended as I am right now.  To everyone reading this, you should read &quot;Here is what music truly is.  Now listen carefully&quot; by q1a.  It is a review of this CD that was posted on June 30.  If you click the &quot;see more about me&quot; link you will see that this person is derranged and possibly insane and dangerous.  In his reviews, he describes how he would like to kill Avril, Jessica, Britney, Beyonce, Justin, MTV, etc.  He describes stabbing Avril with a knife and dancing around her grave and how he would like to push all the pop stars into a fiery hell.  Also, he states Avril does not write her own material, which she clearly does.  I sincerely hope this person is banned.<BR>Anyway, &quot;Under My Skin&quot; is an excellent CD.  It is not as good as &quot;Let Go&quot; but it is still a nice album.  It's more rockish than &quot;Let Go&quot; although this is still pop music.  The best tracks are My Happy Ending, Take Me Away, Slipped Away, Who Knows, Nobody's Home, and Don't Tell Me.  Avril's lyrics can be a bit silly but after all, she is only 19.  I look forward to her third album.
B000059MEK|5.0|This is hands down Daft Punk's best CD. Where else can you find techno music that contains elements of Supertramp, Eddie Van Halen and a creative Barry Manelow sample? This really isn't techno, it really isn't dance, it's just really good music. A must buy.<br />Oh and as requested, I want to recommend another instrumental CD, a killer instrumental CD, by Mr.Deviant called &quot;Techno Obsession&quot;. It's a killer mix of power rock and hard dance music. Check it out if you don't fear any conspiracies.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Aronofsky is one of the great directors of our time.  Excellent camera work and casting, alongside a brilliant soundtrack make this movie a classic and one of my all-time favorites.  Substance abuse at it's best.
B00005JKC3|1.0|The Hollywood formula: 1) option a classic story, 2) use the fame of the classic story to sell worthless crap, 3) repeat steps 1 and 2. <BR>A shortage of quality fare for monster movie fans, which is tragic and ridiculous in the CGI age, combined with anticipation by Hulk fans of a modern feature-length treatment of their beloved big green guy adds up to another painful disappointment which leaves us once again wondering if Hollywood can be trusted to deliver anything worth the precious two hours of our lives which we gamble every time we think they finally have a story with which they can't go wrong. Well, they've screwed this one up, too. What little that is enjoyable about this tragic waste cannot come close to making it worth the cellophane used to wrap the DVD case. <BR>The story is insufferably tedious and the effects are horrible. Lou Ferrigno in green makeup was more believeable than this half-baked computer image. Do CGI geeks spend so much time in front of computer screens that they never witness real life?<BR>The &quot;plot&quot; is one of those weak Hollywood attempts at being psychologically profound or &quot;deep,&quot; a characteristic I'm beginning to believe no one on the payroll in tinseltown is capable of. Traditionally, the core essence of the story of The Incredible Hulk is that Bruce Banner is a tragic figure, forever searching for a cure to his crippling affliction. This movie scuttles that concept in favor of a rage-addicted, &quot;I like it&quot; line. Sort of a WWF approach. Psychologically deep, yeah, like Rambo was a profound commentary on the Vietnam War. <BR>Giving this &quot;movie&quot; one star is being overly generous, but we can't give anything less, like zero stars, or a half-star, or a small, gray, gravel-sized piece of asteroid. I rationalize the one star as acknowlegement of accurate script supervision, and because, yes, the tank scene was mildly entertaining, in a WWF/Rambo sort of way.<BR>Incredible Hulk fans steer clear.<BR>Ireccomend watching Pete's Dragon instead, as the story and the special effects are far superior.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This is a brilliant work of art that leaves you thinking about the movie long after its ending.  One of my personal favorites.
B00005JLPK|5.0|I'm usually disappointed when it comes to biopics; apparently they are very hard to make. Getting inside the head of a surrealist painter and telling her life in two hours with only celluloid and a soundtrack seems like an impossible task. But you wouldn't know it to experience this hauntingly beautiful symphony of sights and sounds which is in itself a work of art. I disagree with most of the criticisms on this thread. The beginning is not boring; I was convinced I had to own this DVD within the first twenty minutes. The writing is brilliant and moving. Most biopics fall into the trap of being a mere chronology of events. This one succeeds where most fail: it is a story. The characters are all rich, deep, real, and thereby completely loveable. Of course it is probably scientifically impossible to not find Salma Hayek loveable. In this film, though, everyone shines. Trotsky, Diego's ex-wife, even the bar musicians radiate with human beauty. Salma Hayek has shown the world that she is quite capable of taking the lead in a serious role. And with a role as powerful as Frida Kahlo, if it's done right, the resulting portrait achieves its potential as a masterpiece.
B000003TAW|5.0|I usually hate people that say the older the CD, the better it is.  Many think if they say the oldest CD is the best CD, they sound like true fans.  It doesn't.  Usually, as time goes on, they get better recording equipment, and more talent--lyrically, and musically.<br />This is not the case.<br />This is THE Weezer album.  That's all I can say.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I got this cd on a whim.  I am not a very big fan of hers, but I did enjoy some songs on her first album &quot;Let Go.&quot;  I can't tell you all how much I enjoy her new cd &quot;Under My Skin.&quot;  Her voice has matured, and you can tell that a great amount of emotion lies behind most of her songs.  Some of the lyrics can be a bit trite at times, but most of the songs are still done very well.  I particually like &quot;He Wasn't&quot; because it is fun to listen to, &quot;Forgotten&quot; because it is a GREAT song to listen to while angry, and &quot;Fall to Pieces&quot; because it is a very sweet, almost uncharacteristic song.  It is rare that a sophomore album outshines the original these days, but Avril Lavigne has certainly accomplished that with this release.  It's a great buy!
B00000099Y|5.0|May I please state a word or two to all the _________ giving this wonderful album one star reviews and whining about long songs, bad music or unintelligent lyrics and who are, worst of all, telling people to listen to stuff that has not seen day light from within their ___ cracks for at least 3 decades. WAKE UP! We are looking for new things, not stuff that  we've heard and thrown in the dumpster and then lit it on fire.

B00005JKGZ|5.0|This is a great dvd of &quot;Meet Me in Saint Louis,&quot; the wonderful classic musical.  It's beautifully packaged and contains so much behind the scenes and extra bonus material it's well worth the price.  A great addition to any musical dvd collection.  I highly recommend it and was very pleased with it.  Also Judy's daughter LIza is interviewed also.  Great dvd a classic to keep!
B00003CXCT|1.0|Don't you just love these film makers who have such egos that they believe that their films are considered national treasures. Just like when Spielberg re-made E.T. and tossed it out into theaters and then on DVD years after it's original release and expected fans to bow down and worship.....instead, it bombed harder than pearl harbor (the event...not the horrible film). Hopefully, they same will happen here. I can't think of anything better than to see this tripe collect dust on the shelves of stores all over the world. But, I'm sure it will sell very well...geeks need something to bow down to instead of \\"the ole' in out, in out\\".<br />Not the original films...so why bother?
0385474547|4.0|This book is a required reading for high school and I didn't know what to think when I finished the book.  The writing was unique and the story is depressing but it does send out a good message about fear and how it takes over one's life.  I liked it all in all but some of the things I didn't need to hear.  For example, stories about murdering twins and then throwing them in the woods?  That's very frightening
6304106017|1.0|this movie was good for the first 40 minutes....after that it just blew REALLY hard. vampires? come on! i felt like i was watching &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer.&quot; it had the potential to be a very good movie, but instead pussied out. don't even bother renting this. or option number 2: rent it for the first forty minutes of it, and laugh at the rest.
B0001HAHXW|3.0|When I heard Clapton was releasing this record, I immediately wondered WHY? I thought he was retired. Well, maybe that's just from live touring and playing. Anyway, he did come out with it, I listened to it, and here is my assessment.<br />I would not recommend this record until you have listened to and learned to appreciate the original versions done by Mr. Johnson himself. And I consider myself an Eric Clapton fan.<br />For many years, I have appreciated and listened to blues music. I admit that, because of my age (54), I first listened to the more accessible British white kids like the Stones and Yardbirds, who, ironically enough, were largely responsible for making blues palatable and popular in the States. The hope was that after being introduced to the music by these rock/blues bands, you would have the urge to go back and listen to the people who actually created the music in the first place. So that's what I did. <br />When I first listened to Robert Johnson's recordings, I was a bit mystified as to why Clapton and seemingly everyone else found them so monumentally great. To my young white ears, they were rough and raw, his voice was too high, the sound too scratchy and primitive. But I kept listening and began to realize just how far-reaching his music was. I read about his short and tragic life and I tried very hard to imagine what it must have been like to be an itinerant blues singer in Mississippi in the 1930's. Of course, I could not come close to imagining it because of who I was, and who I am. Over time, I came to realize the power and feeling of that music. The roughness and crudeness of it was what made it so real. <br />Many white musicians have become very, very wealthy through imitating the music of older, poorer black musicians. It's always seemed like a type of plagiarization to me; maybe they should have given 10 cents of every dollar they made to the families of the guys they ripped off. But that's a big subject, and maybe Clapton and his ilk have been doing this all along; I hope so. <br />I am sorry. I'm getting too heavy here. Clapton has always been very upfront about his admiration for the older guys, and I am not accusing him of greed or anything like that at all. Like any of the thousands of blues musicians of all races out there, first and foremost he loves the music and wants to play it himself. <br />But do we need all of these recordings?? Why should there be a hundred different blues bands committing a hundred different versions of Sweet Home Chicago to cd? Just because you can play it and you like it doesn't mean you should release it on disk and ask for people to pay for it. Instead, play it at your live shows, tell us who wrote it, and urge us to go out and buy the original recording, which was much better than your's anyway.<br />Listen to Little Richard do Tutti Fruitti, and then, try to listen to Pat Boone's version. For blues, compare Mick Jagger or Robert Plant to Muddy Waters or Sonny Boy II. Most white people do not have the voice to sing blues; their voices are too thin, their enunciation too clear. Clapton has made himself a pretty good singer, but he can't come close to Muddy or Robert or any of the other great old black singers. <br />I guess I am a purist.
B000066F6H|1.0|I regret buying the cd. Say what you will about rock revival, the thing is...this band is annoying. Maybe you like annoying? I listened to it a few times than it drifted to the bottom of my CD pile.

B000002LND|5.0|By 1990, Madonna had scored an impressive string of hit singles that few artists have ever matched. By this time, she collected 25 of the 49 hit singles she has scored since 1983. And while it does leave some stuff out, it's a brilliant collection.<br />&quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; contains many Madonna favorites, from &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; to &quot;Material Girl&quot; to &quot;Like A Prayer&quot;. These songs, along with &quot;Open Your Heart&quot;, &quot;Cherish and &quot;Express Yourself&quot;, are among the greatest songs in popular music. Anyone who deosn't like these songs does not have a good ear for good music. Also, there's a few not so recognized songs included here, like the beautiful ballads &quot;Crazy For You&quot; and &quot;Live To Tell&quot; as well as the eerie &quot;Rescue Me&quot; <br />As I said earlier, the immaculate collection does leave some stuff out, and only one of these omitted songs failed to make the top 10. The  songs not included here are:<br />&quot;Angel&quot; (number 5)<BR>&quot;Dress You Up&quot; (number 5)<br />&quot;True Blue&quot; (number 3)<BR>&quot;Who's That Girl&quot; (number 1, the most telling omission)<BR>&quot;Causing A Commotion&quot; (number 2)<BR>&quot;Oh Father&quot; (number 20, the song that broke her top 10 streak)<BR>&quot;Keep It Together&quot; (number 8)<BR>&quot;Hanky Panky&quot; (number 10)<br />Still, what's here is an amazing legacy of music created in such short time by an artists who remains an icon of the 20th century and an influence on so many musicians.

B00000JLWW|3.0|Three stars is the average of 1 star and 5 stars: 1 for the love story, 5 for the ship and its fate.<br />Like many reviewers I found the romance between Jack and Rose extremely unconvincing. DiCaprio is simply too young, too wimpy, and too uneducated for me to accept him as someone whom Rose would fall for so completely. I could see him as being a shipboard fling for the sophisticated Rose--and it would have been a good plot device if Hockley had complacently let his fiancee have a few days to toy with Jack and get him out of her system--but had the Titanic docked, my impression is that Rose would have tired of Jack pretty fast. The whole thing was cloying and silly.<br />But the Titanic was a good actor. The re-creation of the tragedy was very well done, and stuck very close to history as far as I can tell. Many of the secondary characters were interesting, especially poor Mr. Andrews, the ship designer. I think that a viewer would have to have a heart of stone not to be moved by the scene where the musicians return and accompany their leader in &quot;Nearer My God to Thee&quot; while Captain Smith walks forlornly onto his flooded bridge to await the end. (And isn't it interesting how the music provided by I Salonisti, such as the Offenbach piece, is far superior to the sound-track music written for the film?) This was a moving and dramatic account of a great tragedy (interspersed by nonsense like Hockley's attempt to assassinate Jack with Lovejoy's pistol.)<br />So 3 stars for Titanic, a movie whose story shows that Truth is not only stranger than fiction, but often more interesting, too.
B00005KK4P|4.0|I agree with one of the reviewers here: sometimes Bohm's tempi are a bit slow, especially in the first movement of the 'Unfinished'.

B00003CXCT|1.0|A long time ago, in the seventies to be precise, a film maker made a low budget movie that became a huge hit. The movie did so well, that the film maker was able to do what he really wanted, which was to quit making films and start making marketing gimmicks galore in order to become filthy rich. However, soon the public became tired of this film makers films, the money began to dry up and the films...fell from memory.<BR>Then, on the twenty year anniversary of the original films release, the film maker had an idea. He decided to re-make all of the 3 original films in the hopes that all the original people that paid to see them, would pay again. He added new scenes that were deleted, changed the way fans always looked at one of the characters and just added a bunch of **** to get people to drop that cash at the theaters. And behold, it worked! Geeks across America lined up and even camped out, because they have no life, in order to see what the mighty film maker had done to their beloved movies.  <BR>To show his appreciation for the added funds into his bank account, the film maker announced he would make all new movies for the geeks to enjoy, thus ensuring that his bank account would grow even more.<BR>Geeks rejoiced! and in 1999 the film maker unveiled the first new marketing gimmick, I mean movie, to his loyal geeks. As before, geeks all across the land camped out weeks in advance to catch a glimpse of what the film maker had created for them. Many couldn't drive and had their mommies, the only women they'll ever know, drive them to the theaters and pick them up once the film was over. And it was a success....until after the opening weekend, word of mouth spread how terrible the new film was. Some geeks even realized that these were nothing more than 2 hour commercials for the film makers toys, games, t-shirts, cereals, pajamas, bed sheets and everything else you could think of. This trend continued with the hideous release of the second new commercial from the film maker. Now, even more geeks were seeing the light. Which leads us to today, it seems that the film maker has another gimmick up his sleeve, the long awaited DVD release of those first few commercials, I mean movies.  Many geeks rejoiced...at first, until they learned that the DVDs would only be the re-made gimmick versions of their beloved commercials.  So, they refused to buy the set of DVDs, got a little courage and called sweet Mary Jenkins, the 36D 5' 11\\" blonde down the street that always goes sunbathing in a sheer white micro bikini on her front lawn, and asked her for a date. Now that's using the force.

This is Vonnegut at his finest as he intertwines the destiny of so many characters including himself.

B00003CX8I|3.0|X Men, the youthful animation that divides love and evil, is a good film, incorporating great special effects, not to mention the childish violence. But X Men really is a grave political allegiry, highlighting how the governments of the world sometimes thing they are making changes for the best, whilst the silent minority, in this case the mutants, think otherwise. Taking it on one level, this film is an entertaining, action-packed thriller, but one should really consider how the undertone of this animation reflects on a democracy whereby everyone should be considered, and not just the elite. Three stars; that really is all I'm giving.

6303282237|5.0|This film deserves a Criterion DVD complete with a restored print. It certainly is a timely film and I find its vision of mutual tolerance and charity between Christians and Muslims particularly welcome at the present moment (especially with all those frothering neocons yapping about a clash of civilizations).  It will be interesting to see Ridley Scott's forthcoming Crusades film, which looks to be an avatar of El Cid. <BR>There is curently a DVD available from amazon.co.uk, but do not buy it. It is full screen, not widescreen.  There is a DVD available from Amazon.fr, however, which does have widescreen.  I saw the film when I was eight (for my birthday) in 1962 and saw it on television (wth a pan and scan edit) which butchered the 70 mm Technirama print. The fullscreen (tv) format gives one only less than two thirds of the actual frame.  It's a wonder to see the French DVD version on my 23 inch flat computer screen.  the only problems with htis DVD are that the print is not a great one--there are scratches every now nad then, and hte sound track is momentarily off for a few seconds.  More troublesome is that the French subtitles were burned into the print, so they can't be removed when you watch the DVD in English (there is also a French dubbed version).  And the various menu features don't work except for film and language tracks. Still, I'm glad I got it and recommend it until a DVD here becomes available.

6305511055|5.0|Whenever I see this movie I always hear Roger Daltry's voice singing, 'can you see the real me?' Which is what a less loquacious Robert Redford tries to do after what may be one of the top ten movie opening scenes of all time, 70's, 80's, 90's or beyond.<br />Earlier reviews have fairly well constructed and described the plot but what's interesting is the unbelievability of it. Sydney Pollack keeps the heat on and the emotional cul de sacs plentiful as Redford tries to whittle down not so much the who killed all his coworkers but the why.<br />I believe alongside &quot;Bullit,&quot; &quot;French Connection,&quot; &quot;Body Heat&quot; and a few others, this is an essential movie both for it's time and our time. In light of Vietnam and Watergate, we just didn't blindly trust Uncle Sam anymore and were frequently reminded of the protest idiom, 'love your country; fear your government.' And for a captivating two hours, Redford is 'everyperson' ever profiled, searched, audited, traffic stopped, drafted and perhaps far worse. We didn't have to read George Orwell to know big brother was and is watching.<br />Cliff Robertson, a gifted actor denied his peak years because of pseudo-administration influence (do you remember 'Flowers for Algernon/Charley?), ironically plays the government role, as you would expect, brilliantly, and Max Von Sydow, is as always, superlative. I agree with some of the criticism of Faye Dunaway. She did better in other roles than she did here. It could have been Meryl Streep or Glenn Close as well, possibly better.<br />Essential movie if you want to know what you're talking about. Larry Scantlebury. 5 Stars.

If you want a simple, wonderful introduction to how life can be, you might want to read this book. <br />I do not agree with the other reviewers in this thread, who say this book is against the western lifestyle. The author does have criticism about the western civilisation, and if you think about it, it all does make sense. <br />Thanks to this book I have found my path, and inner peace that goes with it. It has so many treasures inside, that I cannot even begin to mention them all...

B00008973Q|5.0|People who care about grandiloquent visuals yet a controlled palette accentuated by the immemorable use of sound -- or, in one major battle scene, the absence of the sounds of the battle, the horrors of war somehow magnified by the silent screams and the unheard bullets, only the quietly mournful dissonance of the haunting background score to be heard.<br />Castle gates close with resounding, hollow booms, shutting people out, shutting people in. A crescendo of cicadas. And the final anguished shriek of a flute lending a much more effective voice to the great tragedy that has been played out than closing words might have done.<br />If you're expecting flaming Gladiator-type fight scenes or Samurai action, you may be disappointed. That said, the battle scenes are magnum opus if you know how to appreciate visual splendor. The screenplay may be relaxed overall, sure, it takes a while to unfold a tale of filial destruction (&quot;King Lear&quot; adaptation) but when the forts crumble and arrows fly asunder, the pace of the film is unbridled.<br />Whether you're a film philistine or a major Kurosawa buff or simply someone who relishes tastefully done cinema, this is absolutely worth the ride. I highly recommend this as a rental, but the discerning types may also want to add it to their collections. It's among Kurosawa's best.

B0001UL7RY|2.0|The only reason I know of this CD is because my little sister bought it and left it in my CD player, so really I listened to it by mistake. Anyways...<br />Avril Lavigne took over the writing of the songs, and really she isn't that great of a lyricist. While you're listening to these songs you can guess what she's gonna say next. It usually goes like &quot;something something thoughts inside my head / I regret all those things I said&quot; and so on. The most &quot;unique&quot; thing she says is &quot;get off of my bed&quot; which is supposedly rebellious for a girl her age.<br />The production is well done for her style though. I find it boring and it gets old through one listen.<br />Overall I guess this is something my little sister could enjoy but anybody who isn't 10 years old and says she is a mature, experienced lyricist is just ignorant.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|I finally saw this film, and am awe-struck! The attention to detail is quite exceptional, thanks to the brilliant vision of director Peter Weir. I was wondering if ths might be a franchise...&quot;Far Side of the World&quot; ...maybe there'll be more. The action scenes and the flawless cinematography, not to mention brilliant editing, draw the viewer in and you're taken away. Crowe is great, as is Paul Bettany, who creates a sense of purpose and legitimacy to the proceedings. And Billy Boyd is certainly a busy guy, appearing in two Oscar nominated blockbusters in one year (&quot;LOTR&quot;). This is a well-made, seriously endearing action drama with loads of heart. Check it out!
0743455967|5.0|Book Review: Stephen King - On Writing<br />I enjoyed the first half of the book for the humorous lighthearted approaches Steve takes to his life. One inspiring moment would not leave my mind. I wish that I had one in my own life as significant. As a young boy Steve copied the works of his favorite comic and showed the result to his mother. \\"Write one of your own, Stevie,\\" she said. WOW! Obviously the seed of a writer was already planted but what fertilizer was that moment in Stephen King's life. Permission to write came at a very significant age. So many writers struggle to give themselves permission to write. A comment like this reminds me how influential a parent is to their child. Imagine what may have become of Steve had his mother been a different woman.<br />Other enjoyable moments involved poison ivy, a rather naughty school distribution and Steve's bleak telling of his drug and alcohol abuse. With the latter I sat wondering at Stephen's courage. Not just to relate these facts openly and honestly to his readers, but also to step beyond his dependency and hope, perhaps pray, that his writing did not come from the altered state. Some of his readers would see Steve in a darker light when realizing he is a former addict. I know that my image of Stephen changed. I saw in him honor, courage and a great strength to overcome. I admire him for stepping through the fear I can only imagine he must have felt and coming past it into real living. May we all learn from his experience.<br />When I reached the middle of Stephen King's \\"On Writing: A Memoir\\", I could not help but notice the very distinct change of voice between the first section and the second. I wondered how the light hearted man, who wrote about living life even through some very hard moments, could possibly be the same man who wrote in stilted lament. I read feeling rather resentful of the attitude I felt coming from the pages. I wondered how he dared imply that the way he did things was the only way to do them. I was particularly flummoxed at the parts where Steve speaks of plot and how no writer should ever use plot, story is the key element. I agree, story is key, but my current novel is laid out perfectly on a large board with every little plot nuance decided. Of course since I am suffering a serious writer's block with that novel perhaps Steve has merit when he speaks of plotting and the damage it can do to story.<br />Beyond that single disagreement I found Steve spoke to the readers of \\"On Writing\\" with integral truth. He spoke fact, but somehow in the second half of the book there seemed a lot less joy. It is only when I reached the postscript I realized why the two halves of one book seemed so different. You may notice the significance of change yourself when you read this book and you will find as I did that there is an rather extreme reasoning for it. Right where the voice changed is the eighteen months where Steve had been recuperating after being hit by a Dodge van. This life-changing event very obviously changed his sense of self and ultimately his voice, his writing.<br />The second half of the book involves a lot of helpful advice, but personally I felt that a writer would find the first half much more inspiring. The second half answers questions you might have, but the answers are only helpful if you write in the same way Steve writes. Every writer does things their own way and while you can take his words and mince them in your own mind and heart into something of your own, if you attempt to copy his routine exactly you will loose your self. He admits this also and I thank him for once again being so honest. The second half of the book offers a great deal to aspiring writers but I feel the first half offered twice that again.<br />Overall this book is a wonderful read for all writers and entertaining for non-writers. I freely admit that I have never read another of Stephen King's books but having read this one I am itching to read some of his fiction. He has a fluid hand that is a delight to read. I did find the profanity scattered across the book grating, but he has a section where he speaks of that also. It says a lot about who Stephen is and how he was raised. The entire book opens him up for readers to really know him, and that is a true connection of minds that shouts the truth he shares of writer's telepathy.<br />Despite all he has suffered in life Stephen comes out a stronger man. In \\"On Writing\\" he offers aspiring writers a wealth of advice the most significant being, \\"Read a lot, Write a lot.\\" You can only learn your subject by immersing yourself in it and as with all artistic desire to reach perfection the Carnegie hall anecdote comes to mine, \\"Practice, practice, practice\\". Thank you, Stephen King, for sharing yourself with me. I am a better person and hopefully a better writer because of your candor.<br />Rebecca Laffar-Smithn.

B00003CWL6|5.0|I've read some of the other reviews, and they blab away the plot. I won't do that. What's important is that this is a first screenplay from Alan Ball, and he deserved his Oscar. Sam Mendes put it all in perspective, and brought a brilliant cast to fruition. A lot of this is about middle-age angst, but there are terrific insights about current young person's issues. Wes Bentley is wonderful, as is Thora Birch, and, later, Mena Suvari. The film really centers around Kevin Spacey and he deserved his Oscar. Some may take issue that Annette Benning should've won. (She lost to Hilary Swank, who was in almost every frame of &quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot;)Phenomenal extra characters, and Chris Cooper was exceptional as Bentley's gung-ho military father (nominated for a SAG award). Peter Gallagher hasn't had as good a role since Altman's &quot;Short Cuts&quot;. His scenes with Benning are amusing.The plot twists are plenty, and the ending already told at the beginning. The problem with the current DVD is that there were alternate endings, not included; and it would really be fun to find out other things might've been going on.  The resolution was so open-ended, I'd love to see what Mendes &amp; Ball had in mind as alternatives. Awards Edition? OK. A real edition? That might be fun.
038073186X|1.0|This book was so bad I could not finish it. The characters are boring, the story is boring, the plot is boring. There is absolutely no incentive to care about the story and keep reading it. About two thirds through I stopped wasting my time and wished I had my money back. The dialogue is lifeless, The story line is numb. I am amazed at the good reviews listed on Amazon because I found this book to be unsuspensful, uninteresting and unbelievable.

This CD is a desert island disc, or , if you only had 10 cd's to own, or, if you wanted to pick out music that was the most significant and important in rock n roll history, this is one of them. And this is not coming from a &quot;Deadhead&quot;. This album is a gem. Not one bad tune. It re-defined the role of American themes and genres in a contemporary setting. It is a record almost perfect : we should all be so lucky if someone down the line could produce something equally as significant.

I'm one of those people who swear by this book.<br />The characters are richly drawn, the writing is powerful and convincing, and the story is riveting.<br />Everything in this book just clicks; the ending was great, the beginning was great, heck, the middle was great too. Never was the book monotonous or dull, and never could I put the book down. An attribute to how much I like the book is that I've managed to read the book not just once, but three times.<br />So read this book. Even if you don't like it you can at least see what all the fuss is about.<br />Oh, and by the way, Enders Game will be made into a movie. (I can't wait!)
B000001E18|5.0|A lot of things can and have been said about U2, but one thing you can't accuse the band of is not taking chances. Compare &quot;Zooropa&quot; with their earlier albums like &quot;War&quot; and &quot;October&quot; and you notice a stunning change in mood and especially sound. This is the kind of album made for the extremely diverse listener or the fan not afraid to explore new flavors. It feels as if the group was tired and bored of being shackled as simple message givers and anthem composers and decided to burst out of the bubble and simply have fun with what a studio can do. A lot of artists have tried to dramatically change their sound (remember Pat Boone and Neil Diamond?) and have failed miserably, deciding to return to their place of origin. But U2 are skilled craftsmen who know how to work with a team composed of brains like Daniel Lanois (absent here) and Brian Eno (big architect here). The Eno influence is big here with the electronic brushstrokes and how the album goes more for atmosphere than straight ahead rock. The opening title track is practically an epic of images and sounds, Bono describes and promises with lush techno synths gliding around. But this isn't U2 going techno, it's U2 PLAYING with techno. &quot;Babyface&quot; for example sounds like a sweet pop tune but notice The Edge creeps up with a snarling guitar riff that still sounds at home. Speaking about The Edge, who is underrated as a vocalist, his stand-out moment is &quot;Numb,&quot; a rap with a techno guitar riff sliding back and forth in the background. The song is essentially just the same beat over and over with Edge speaking, yet it still manages to capture you with the words and his phrasing. &quot;Lemon&quot; is the kind of track some U2 fans love and others hate. The track feels like U2 take some lessons from Blondie and adding their own touches to a song that sounds like disco for the new century. It's a fun song with cryptive lyrics about Bono's memory images of his mother and an evocative chorus. Yet amidst all the experimentation, U2 still deliver songs that are undeniably theirs like &quot;Stay (Faraway, So Close!),&quot; a hypnotic movement of chords and vocals where Bono takes on the character of an angel speaking out to a soul. This was of course recorded for a Wim Wenders angel flick and it works to great effect. &quot;The First Time&quot; feels like a classic U2 love song, like a left over from &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; or &quot;Rattle And Hum.&quot; &quot;Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crash Car&quot; sounds perfect for the European dance scene while &quot;Dirty Day&quot; feels like a dark, sinister cousin of &quot;Bullet The Blue Sky.&quot; The album closes with a master stroke with Johnny Cash stepping in for &quot;The Wanderer.&quot; It's a powerful, emotional moment with Cash delivering an apocalyptic vision with the synthesizers bubbling behind him. The brilliant thing about &quot;Zooropa&quot; is that it only SOUNDS different, listen with care and read the lyrics and you realize everything spiritual, social and political that U2 has been saying through their music is still there intact. With &quot;Zooropa&quot; U2 once again achieve something interesting, deep and create that thing so missing in a lot of today's new bands, art.
B00005RZV4|4.0|Perhaps not the best live CD release in existence, but STILL a fine disc at that. Not sure what is missing, but 'And All That...' does seem to leave something to be desired. Notice that the used stores seem to have a fair share of used copies, but I most certainly plan to hang onto my copy for years to come. The sixteen track CD serves as an audio document of NIN's 2000 U.S. tour,of which I saw and I remember the gig being no less than top rate. Trent Reznor and his four touring musicians appear to draw the listener in with tunes that (more or less) had managed to make NIN a household name.You know,their gems like &#34;March Of The Pigs&#34;, &#34;The Frail&#34;, &#34;Wish&#34;, &#34;Suck&#34;, &#34;Closer&#34;, &#34;Head Like A Hole&#34;, &#34;The Day The World Went Away&#34; and &#34;Hurt&#34;. Must admit though, the disc sounds very close to the studio versions of the songs on there of. Overall, I wasn't really disappointed with this disc, but I've heard of a few other fans that somewhat were.
0385335482|5.0|I loved this book.. I loved this series! I read through it in a few days, unable to put it down.  I recommend it wholeheartedly, as the humor is great, and Becky so realistic.  Never again will you think of a Denny and George scarf without thinking of this book too.
B0000089FS|4.0|With 1988's Reg Strikes Back, Elton John returned to making a serious effort to abandon his excesses of the past few years that plagued his recordings since 1984's Breaking Hearts. There aren't a lot of gimmicks here - just straight forward rock and roll. Sure, it has some of the technology trappings of the late 80s, but this time, they don't over power the songs.<br />At the height of personal problems, Elton, once again, has risen to the occassion. If he had continued to put out poor product like 1985's Ice on Fire and it's follow-up, Leather Jackets, it could have been dooms day for the English piano player. Instead, what he delivers here isn't necessarily his best album, but certainly a turn in the right direction.<br />The album cover explains it all: in the midst of the crazy and tackiest 70s and 80s stage costumes, stand little Elton, or in this case Reg, his real name. It seems as if an awakening of sorts had dawned on him - get rid of the excess baggage and get down to business and make a fun rock album. And that's what he and lyricist Bernie Taupin do. So, does the music live up to all of the expectations?<br />Starting with Town of Plenty, Elton sings with utmost conviction on a song about the media and the constant struggle fame brings. The music is pretty shallow however and ultimately goes no where. Plus, Taupin's lyric is very difficult to sing along with. But the band and particularly the backing vocals, try hard to make you enjoy it. The next song, A Word In Spanish, is a beautiful ballad that has a terrific guitar solo by Davey Johnstone. This was the second single from the release and though it peaked in the Top 20, it deserved a place in the Top 10. Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters (Part II) resembles nothing close to its 1972 companion, but how could Elton try to mirror the original melody without ripping it off? The music here is jubliant, upbeat and fun. This second look at New York City is more celebratory instead of downbeat. Whether or not it should have been associated with the former version is up for someone else to decide. Standing firmly on its own, Part II is a welcome addition to this album. The big hit, I Don't Wanna Go On With You Like That follows and is everything an Elton single should be: catchy, fun and memorable.<br />The rest of the release follows pretty much the same formula. Goodbye Marlon Brando is one of Elton's best rockers, Heavy Traffic laments the drug war albeit with a very progressive melody line, and Since God Invented Girls is a homage to the Beach Boys and is a pleasant enough ballad. Some of the misses on this album include: Japanese Hands, which isn't over done but is just way too long; Poow Cow, a very obnoxious song that should have been left for a b-side somewhere with its tale of a poor girl who gets abused by her husband; and lastly, The Camera Never Lies, seems to be filling in space.<br />Producer Chris Thomas give a fresh polish to these songs and for once, doesn't bury the album in wall of sound foolishness. Also, the backing vocals by the original band give this album a very reminiscent feel even though except for Davey, they don't play on the release. My only quibble would be that Elton's piano is made part of the mix, not the sole focal point. Vocally, Elton sounds charged up and determined win us over. <br />Lyrically, the album is all over the place but Taupin still delivers his well branded style of pop lyrics. They may not be as moving or introspective as previous efforts but at least he keeps it interested in his own way. <br />Reg Strikes Back was a new beginning (how many times has he renewed himself musically?) for Elton John. His best album? No. But it showed the pop world that he still had plenty of life in him.
B00005JMEW|1.0|I thought this was terrible. It had a badly written script, bad acting, and ok, I don't really like action movies.
1592400876|5.0|At the age of 59, and having worked in marketing for most of my years, I have read enough business-generated documents to fill a black hole: marketing plans, research findings, proposals and memos, far too many memos. Many of these documents were written by highly intelligent people, some of them CEOs, CFOs, chairmen of boards, and the one thing the vast majority have in common is incorrect punctuation; errors ranging from mild to embarassing to shocking. Lynn Truss has given us a book that takes only a few hours to read and, more importantly, a good bit of on-point humor that provides an effective way to keep the rules of punctuation in mind. Just as music makes the memorization of lyrics both easy and natural, Lynn's humor makes the rules of punctuation easy and natural to retain. It isn't often that books make me laugh out loud. To laugh out loud while learning something as important, and as dry, as punctuation is a supreme accomplishment.
B000000WA4|5.0|I bought this when it first came out, some years ago. I've since moved on to other bands, but I must admit, after all these years, MCIS still remains my favourite album of all time. And this comes from a person who listens to everyone from metal to musicals, religious music to Marilyn Manson. Here is a short run through of all the songs.<br />1. MCIS 8/10 - Instrumental piece. great opening track.<BR>2. Tonight, Tonight 10/10 - grandeur to the max! lyrics are memorable as hell!<BR>3. Jellybelly 7/10 - Guitar onslaught with catchy chorus<BR>4. Zero 9/10 -  Emptiness is loneliness...etc. One of the most memorable lines and riffs in rock history<BR>5. Here is no why 7/10 - don't quite dig this one as much as my friends<BR>6. bullet with butterfly wings 10/10 - despite all my rage, i am still just a rat in a cage. talk about classic rock slogans!<BR>7. to forgive 7.5/10 - grows on you. give it a chance. mellow melancholia<BR>8. an ode to no one 7/10 - pure angst ramble<BR>9. love 8.5/10 - incredible distortion intro! the perils of love indeed!<BR>10. cupid de locke 8/10 - lyrics read like a good poem. mystic, dreamy, lovely<BR>11. galapogos 9/10 - sweet lullaby, sweet lull of a guitar intro<BR>12. muzzle 9/10 - incredible intro, incredible ending, incredible rock song!<BR>13. porcelina of the vast oceans 7/10 - a little too long for my liking but features the classic loud/soft/loud/soft structure of siamese dream<BR>14. take me down 8/10 - sweet closure to the first disc  from iha.<br />1. where boys fear to tread 9/10 - always attempt to drum and keep tempo with the incredible intro of the song.<BR>2. bodies 9/10 - love is suicideeee!!! angry and ficious. guitar onslaught<BR>3. thirty-three 9/10 - sentimental but vague, melodic ode to friends<BR>4. in the arms of sleep 7/10 - puts me to sleep sometimes but it grows on you<BR>5. 1979 10/10 - a ten because this is the song (and video) that got me hooked onto SP and made me buy the album.<BR>6. tales of a scorched earth 6.5/10 - to me weakest song on the album, but even then...it's good! heavily distorted vocals<BR>7. thru the eyes of ruby 7/10 - grows on you with a few listens<BR>8. stumbleine 9/10 - acoustic guitar bliss! gentle vocals<BR>9. XYU 9/10 - refined angst. many segments to the song. swells in its messiness which is great<BR>10. We only come out at night 8/10 - these songs are what make pumpkins unique. no other band has the ability to create such distinct sounding songs!<BR>11. Beautiful 9.5/10 - simply gorgeous lyrics, gorgeous arrangement, and d'arcy is singing backup!<BR>12. lily (my one and only) 9/10 - cute as a button!<BR>13. by starlight 8/10 - melancholic romance. imagine yourself singing this to a lover lying beside you<BR>14. farewell and goodnight 9/10 - the perfect closure to a near perfect album. <br />this album has to be listened through and through. It will take you on an almost spiritual journey through anger, happiness, sorrow, and joy. This is the definitive Pumpkins album, and the definitive album of my teenage years. Get it. Buy it. Adopt it as your child.
0316168815|4.0|I had no idea really what this book was about when I bought it, except that every one seemed to have read it apart from me. From the first page onwards I was hooked, this is the best book I have read so far this year. A great read. I wouldn't recommend the autobiography book though - a little to depressing. Buy this and enjoy!
0784010501|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life.  The way Madonna exploited her mother's death for her benefit, well, it was just exploitation at its finest.<br />Also, the way she treated Warren Beatty and her hairdresser was very self serving.<br />I suffered through this movie.  It stank, imo.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|Sofia Coppola's second feature film &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; skillfully and stylishly depicts joint alienation of two improbable American soulmates, temporarily dwelling in a splashy Tokyo hotel. In the material-crazy world, actor Bob Harris (the excellent Bill Murray) and ex-philosophy student Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson, just 18 in her breakthrough performance) gradually discover they have something in common. They don't lack money, they feel lost among people they do not understand -- both literally and opinion-wise.<br />The film is deliberately slow-paced, atmospheric rather than plot-driven, which is not a bad thing at all. But the problem is that there's not much substance under the glossy, professionally-made surface. The movie is generous in offering life's numerous little ironies, but these subtle, fragile, thought-provoking aspects are often outweighed by comic situations with &quot;funny&quot; Japanese people. These scenes are laugh-making alright, yet a bit cheap. Camerawork floods us with colours and stunning images, the soundtrack of state-of-the-art tunes compounds the alienation of true humanity in the current jungle. However, the result is that &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; can make you feel not lost, but a bit bored. But film lovers -- just for the record of all those awards it garnered -- should not miss it.

B00006RCSR|5.0|In this more realistic version of Cinderella, Drew Barrymore plays Gabrielle, a pretty farm girl who's strength and courage(not prince charming) save her from a bleak future.  In order to save one of the house servants, Gabrielle passes herself off as a courtier and confronts one of the King's men.  Amidst this confrontation, Prince Henry shows up and is impressed by Gabrielle's guts, intelligence, and beauty.  Smitten by the Prince herself, Gabrielle lies to him about who she really is.  <BR>But Gabrielle's stepmother (Angelica Huston) is determined to have the prince marry one of her daughters and she'll do whatever it takes to get Gabrielle out of the way.  Highly recommended for its romance, humor, and suspense.
B0001MDP36|1.0|Cold Mountain left me shivering.  I had spent two hours and five minutes in front of the T. V., the last 30 min. or so praying that the house would catch ablazes and give me cause to stop watching this hypnotically tedious trap of a motion picture.  I don't remember much of the last 40 minutes or so, but I do know that at about the 1 hour 55 min. mark I started wondering how long this picture was.  <BR>If you get this film for the Civil War components, don't bother.  This should have burned with Atlanta.<BR>If you watch this for the romantic aspects, well Chances Are would win raving awards before this slow train.<BR>If you're simply bored, jump off a roof with a blanket.  It could be much more fun and less embarassing to admit to than watching Cold Mountain.<BR>If you're a Nicole Kidman fan, well, I'm speechless.<BR>Nine out of ten doctors recommend this film for treatment of insomniacs.

B00007BH3Y|5.0|One of the most beautiful and unique soundtracks i've ever heard, Phillip Glass' score for the film is definitely, if not better than the film itself.. Straight after i bought it, i put it in my discman, while i was walking the dog, and when i got to the middle of the 2nd track &quot;morning passages&quot;, i literally stopped dead in the middle of the path and was just blown away, by it's incredible portayal of there being no sense of time.. there are many times during the soundtrack, where the music would just send shivers up your spine and even bring tears to your eyes.. it's just.. i have no more to say but buy it!
B000001EIA|5.0|There are a lot of rock bands out there and eager to prove how good their crafts are when it comes to musical acrobatics with the aid of technology-aided gadgets.  During the heavy metal hair band days, a not-so-great musician can make their music a work of art if you watch them play on their music videos. Fast hands and hell-raising voices and exhibitions. But their musical skills were not tested until they play music using raw instruments and come up with very crisp and raw sounds. Thanks to MTV's creative concept - MTV Unplugged which gave real musicians prove to their fans how good they are. Kiss' Unplugged album have just proven their great skills. Only few people out there have the guts to go hard-rockin' using acoustic instruments. And to name a few, Billy Idol, Bryan Adams, Tesla, Eric Clapton &amp; Sting. Am looking forward for Van Halen, Aerosmith, Poison, Warrant, Deep Purple, Journey &amp; Pink Floyd to go UNPLUGGED!!! I dare you guys 'coz there are millions of fans out there to get your acoustic album if you will think of having one. TO KISS, YOU GUYS ARE A FAB!!!
0385484518|5.0|This book's title does not deceive.  It truly is a book filled with &quot;life's greatest lessons&quot;.  This book taught me a lot and I have passed it on to many friends and family members.  I have read it and re-read it and I guarantee that anyone and everyone would benefit from this book.  It teaches you about the importance of family, friends, and maintaining relationships with those who have had a profound impact on your life.  A very touching story, be sure to have some kleenex handy!
B000001Y5X|4.0|In my opinion, one of Manson's best albums. It's much different to all of his other albums, and I absolutely love it.
B000002IQW|5.0|I'm a 15 year old girl. I'm not the type you'd expect to suddenly decide that metal is amazing. My first CD was Shania Twain, and to this day, I'm a huge country fan, although I have branched out into rap and hip hop, as well. However, one day I turned on VH1, and 100 Most Metal Moments was on. The discovery of classic metal music was a thrilling experience. None of my friends listened to this music, so on my own I decided to buy some CDs. My first choice? Slave to the Grind.<br />And what a choice it was. It's like a shock to your system, listening to this CD. With great guitar playing and insane vocal talent, it's impossible not to feel the music intensely. Even the ballads pull you in with their powerful lyrics.<br />This album is a must-have for any fan of metal, no doubt about it.
B00005M91K|5.0|Lets not kid ourselves. This is awe inspiring and captivating film. This review tackles all those who haven't rated it 5 stars. Most of these have seen earlier work by Godfrey Reggio and Ron Fricke. The only thing that separates these earlier works is that some people prefer them over this. In truth, the films are very similiar in technique, time-lapse and camera angles with the only differences being editing, music and locations. <BR>In earlier work Philip Glass composed the music which was appropriate and brilliant (although now slightly dated) and in Baraka, Michael Stearn tried to meld the music to the location. Michael Stearn -in my opinion- creating the better atmosphere.<BR>If you've not seen any of these following Chronos, Koyaanisqatsi, &amp; Powaqqatsi. Then see Baraka, as it is the superior film and tends build on methods, techniques and angles visited in the previous films. I'd also like to mention Alton Walpole who doesn't seem to get much say in reviews, but he's also had an active part in all of these films and part of the 3 main people behind these films.<BR>When you see it make sure that it's on the biggest screen possible, with the best sound system possible in a dark room. And let the music and film take you on the journey that is Baraka.

6305718954|1.0|Ok, first the music is done by Billy Corgan.  That egg headed freak knows about as much about music as nuns know about birth control.  The dead sea scrolls or secret sayings of Jesus are heresy.  If Jesus wanted us to know these things, he would not want me to learn them in a Billy Corgan music video.  They would be in the bible.  I know the bible, and this stuff is not in the bible.  The Catholic Church is hiding some things from us, but they are not lost in the couch cushions. They will be reveal to me, and maybe even you when the time is right.  <br />Patricia Arquette, David Arquette's wife, has some of the worst hair in movie history. Anybody who gets their hair cut in he salon must also find in acceptable to have her hair styled by Stevie Wonder.  She looks like a bleach blonde chicken. But I must admit it was a relief to see a preist make out with a woman rather than a little boy.
B00009ATIX|5.0|Yes, this movie is deliberately paced (aka sloooow), and there is no action in it to speak of. And it is not about some smart planet whatsoever. This is an existential  flick, a meditation on loss and fear. Once you accept that premise, you'll love it.<BR>Plus, the music is absolutely mesmerizing.
0142000663|5.0|As a Junior AP English student, I was bombarded with summer work, and my assignments included chosing a summer book to read from a selected list.  I chose the &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; by John Steinbeck, and was immeadiatly captured in the sad story of the Joads and there turbulent Oddessy.  Sad and depressing yes, but hopeless it is not; if anything this book is about hope and compassion and empathy for others, and for many of us, including the characters in this novel, that is a lesson learned the hard way.  There will probably never be a writer as talented as John Steinbeck; he has a way of making you not only imagine, but feel what is happening in his story.  Steinbeck uses his great skill to show both great beauty and harsh reality, and I hope at the time this book was published that it caused political uproar and brought the people in American aristocracy down to Earth to realize what was occurring.  Although people moving from Oklahoma to California are the least of our great nation's worries, the thoughts expressed in this book have the power to open the eyes of Americans to many troubling situations that exist today.
B000021XR5|5.0|As with most albums, there are a few tracks you may not like -- and I've found virtually all to be superb and those not so much to my liking were still great efforts. Fabulous production and orchestration can be heard throughout the album. Some complain about songs like &quot;Sour Girl&quot; that got a great amount of airplay and didn't reflect the hard edge they knew as STP. Please, lowering your rating because you didn't care so much for a song doesn't diminish the fantastic effort and care that went into this album. This one convinced me that this band is capable of putting out numerous albums worth buying... in fact, they are one of the few bands whom I own every album and consider all of them listenable. Interestingly enough... I like this one the best. It's diverse. It starts of with some incredibly hard edge, biting vocals, has some funky songs for the next few, following by more acoustic rhythmic ballads, a beautiful ballad (Glide) and then a bit more of the aforementioned for the wrap up. A bargain... get it.
B000084T18|1.0|oh come on. How are people gonna say hes like tupac this absolutly sux. You cant even understand what hes saying, im tired of it all mtv has to do is make up a lie and say he got shot nine times had hes like tupac and all the rich kids will go run and buy this crap, it is a shame rap has turned to this. I also herd 50 say he would put hole in anybody who talks badly about him, well 50 cent, come on down to Kensington Ave. in north philly, i'll be there,  and lets see if u do what u say, you poser.
B000084T18|1.0|This is not rap.This is not creative. This is here because a bunch of people think theyre cool by copying him. You want rap, get some outkast or tupac.This is blatantly terrible, and the demise of western culture. Absolutely appaling. 50 cent is up there with britney. Don't people have brains anymore?
B0001NBMBC|5.0|It is good to see slipknot put more effort into their music. Don't get me wrong I am a die hard slipknot fan and have liked all of their stuff(excluding MKFR). Its nice to hear guitar solos and its nice not to be hearing the F word in everyother sentence. This cd is very well done and is possibly their best. I recomend this cd to everyone, not just slipknot fans. Oh and don't listen to the reviews from the people saying that slipknot has &quot;sold out&quot; because they went soft.
B000002UAX|5.0|Bloody Brilliant. You can tell the difference between people who love music, and people who are part of the ongoing fads. This is a brilliant album with four musical Geniuses contributing. Most of the people posting bad reviews have no idea of good music and are just parts of the come and go musical fads. The Beatles Offer much more than something to make yourself feel cool (Britney). A great album , Its by The Beatles, I say no more. Im 16 and i know This is better than all the crap we are forced upon us. Don't have music forced upon you , Go out and grab this album, Theres no turning back.
6304884419|4.0|For a directorial debut,  Deniros first is impressive.  The story takes place in of course,  the Bronx,  about a bus driver and his kid growing up.  Deniro does not overblow the movie....and does capture realistically the street humor and language that makes it very realistic.  <br />     It might not be a Scorsese or Coppola film,  but its very very respectable just the same.  Give it a look,  its very good!!
B000002UB3|5.0|A great Album, I belive the best vocals Paul has ever done is a 20 second Passage In golden Slumbers. It sent shivers down my spine the first time i heard it, and it still does.It seems to me that they pour their heart and soul into every song on this album. A few That aren't their greatest on here, but they are human(just).<BR>Great Album.
B00008EY65|5.0|For those who like action and exlposions this movie is a great entertainment. For me specifically, young star Rupert Evans (Myers) capture my imagination. He is young and bright, hope to see more action-typed movies from him in the future.
B00004ZD69|5.0|Okay, so this is another edited review.  Here's the basics.  Godspeed you Black Emperor is an obscure, orchestral rock band from somewhere in Canada.  They make extended rock opera movements that can be broken down into smaller component sections.  They have very ambiguous and vague political suggestions in the music and in the album art.<br /><br />They are also one of the most talented bands around today.  Go ahead give em a try.  Ever wanted to hear a rock band play compositions like an orchestra?  Well here you go!
B000069AUI|3.0|I could listen to Parachutes (chill out music) beginning to end but I havent even been able to do that with &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;. I usually just get bored and change the CD after the first five songs. Its not an awful album, just not enough to hold my attention for long.
B00008BXJF|5.0|The album that gave me back the power to believe in KC.  Much heavier, more emotional and fun than their previous album Construction of Light, The Power to Believe is the hardest hitting album from Crimson since Red and their best studio album since Discipline from 1981.<br />The album starts with a beautiful processed accapella version of  &quot;The Power to Believe.&quot;  Reiterated in different forms throughout the album, TPTB acts as a unifying theme not unlike &quot;Peace&quot; on In the Wake of Posiedon, KC's second album.  Then CRUNCH!  The instrumental &quot;Level Five&quot; pastes your ears back with blasts of avant-math-metal.  The third number &quot;Eyes Wide Open&quot; is a bitterweet &quot;pop&quot; song about missed oportunities by Adrian Belew and is one of the best songs on the CD. The ending coda is especially emotionaly charged and uplifting. If radio weren't so  market researched/preprogrammed these days I'd say it could be a hit.<br />Heavy and dark, Level Five recalls the album Red, but thats not the only nod to the past on this album.  Others songs bring to mind Starless and Bible Black or Discipline era material.  &quot;Dangerous Curves&quot; sounds like an electronica influenced conflation of &quot;The Talking Drum&quot; from Larks Tongue in Aspic and &quot;Mars&quot; also from  In The Wake of Posiedon.  Robert Fripps guitar playing recalls and updates styles he's used throughout his history in Crimson: from fast unison lines, avant-metal, to soundscape electronica, etc...  But rather than merely aping the past, Fripp and company have made &quot;The Power To Believe&quot;  both a culmination of everything that made past Crimson great, and a step forward.<br />The playing on TPTB is confident and adventurous.  Certainly the band  benefited from doing the improvisation oriented Projects. A &quot;fractalization,&quot; in Fripp's words, of the double trio, ie different arrangements of the then six members of K.C. playing live improvised music. (Check out the Projects boxed set)  That they've been a quartet for two albums has also strengthened Crimson.  Every persons role in the band is more clearly deliniated, its easier for four guys to listen to one another.  Not to mention that its much easier to write for four people than six. There are tight composed songs, spacey soundscapes and improvised, almost electronica sounding pieces.  Crimson easily pull off disciplined circular rhythm patterns, and odd &quot;Indicipline&quot;-like time signatures.  Amazing all around playing from every member.<br />Most notatable is the incredible acoustic and electronic drumming of Pat Mastelloto.  In fact Fripp has been quoted as saying that Pat is a rock drummer, so Crimson wanted to make a rock, more riff based album so that he could really shine.  Well they did and he does.  Trey Gunn on Warr guitar is also an absolute monster.  He's by far a better player than Tony Levin but not as funky or groove oriented.  His solo on &quot;The Power To Believe II&quot; is wonderful, though you have to see Trey live to truly appreciate how really good he is.  Adrian Belew as usual is an absolutely smoking lead guitarist.  But his vocals on TPTB really shine and have an unusually emotional resonance.  They're just great, ranging from hopefull, to critical, to humorous (not something you'd usually think of when discussing King Crimson)<br />The &quot;Power to Believe&quot; is an album that looks to the past but resolutely, and with hope, marches forward.  Its heavy, playful, serious, emotionally touching and has a wide variety of sounds and dynamics.  A friend of mine who has given up on rock as an artform gave what I think is the perfect review: &quot;This album makes me believe that its still possible to make interesting rock music.&quot;c.

0156027321|5.0|Sure, the premise of this book is a bit unrealistic, but Martel is such a talented storyteller that one accepts every bit of &quot;Life of Pi&quot; to be the truth. I came across this book because it was required reading for both my IB/TAG/AP English Literature class and my IB Theory of Knowledge class in high school, and I'm glad I did. It's a page-turner of semi-magical realism that to me evokes the spirit of Marquez and Murakami, without being quite as outlandish.
B00006JDS4|2.0|I was intrigued by the synopsis of &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot;, because I love movies about women getting revenge, like &quot;Kill Bill&quot;, and &quot;Sleepaway Camp 2&quot;. I had been contemplating on weather renting this or not, beucase it's soppousedly soppoused to be so shocking and graphic, that you can't bare to watch it. Well, I was able to watch the whole thing with my eyes open. And it's only sort of shocking. The death scenes are no gorier or violent than those in the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; movies. Now, even tho I love films with women getting revenge, I did not love this. I only sort of liked it. The problem is is that it just didn't have enough to it. It felt like there was something missing. And it's shown in such a monotonous slide-show way. Like, okay, lets see her get raped. Now she cleans herself. Now she kills this guy. Now this guy. Now this guy. Now this guy. It makes the film feel so much shorter, and uncomplete. Now, Camille Keaton; I real liked her acting in this movie. She says everything in a really cool way, but at the same time somehow makes everything she says funny, mostly when she's talking to the guys before she kills them. Overall, I don't reccomend this unless you have to see every horror film on the shelves.

0321200683|5.0|I had been waiting for this book for several years. There are many good books on software architecture using synchronous communication, but nothing on asynchronous communication --- the typical scheme when connecting existing applications. This is surprising since the underlying products (MQ, MSMQ, WebMethods, Vitria, etc.) have been around for a while, some for more than 10 years, and the techniques have become increasingly well understood by the practitioners. There are even some books on the individual products --- several on MQ for example --- but nothing more general about how to use messaging, message routing, and message transformation to build a larger system.<br />This is the book I had been waiting for. Furthermore the authors have avoided the usual three pitfalls of technical books: it is well organized, it well written, and it is deep treatment, not at all superficial.<br />The book is organized into 65 patterns (in the manner of the classic _Design Patterns_). Each pattern shows one typical problem in integrating applications, and how it is solved. Each pattern gives enough implementation details so it is clear how it would work, and an example or two so it is clear how it works in practice. For example the Message Expiration pattern addresses the problem of &quot;How can a sender of a message indicate when a message should be considered stale and thus shouldn't be processed?&quot;<br />The writing in this book is clear. For example &quot;A Message Expiration is like the expiration date on a milk carton. After that date, you shouldn't drink the milk.&quot; The authors have also invented icons for each of their patterns. Their icon language allows a integration architecture to be visuallized in a way that UML does not provide.<br />Amongst the 11 pattern-describing chapters are 3 &quot;interludes&quot;, chapter-length examples that explain a problem, show how patterns can combined to solve it, and then provide implementations in different technologies (JMS, .Net, TIBCO, MSMQ, etc.).<br />My only beef with this book is that it is long and dense: almost 700 pages. I bought it in late December 2003 and I am only finishing it now. But it is hard to say what should have been cut. Certainly none of the patterns are unnecessary, and the decription of each feels like about the right length. The interludes are also useful for seeing how the patterns fit together. So maybe this book just needs to be 700 pages.
B000148KK2|4.0|Diana Krall is purportedly the most commercially successful jazz artist recording today. We, admittedly, are not jazz aficionados, yet we do own the last 4 of Krall's cds. So it seems we might be in a good position to speculate as to the reasons for her popularity. We would suggest that those reasons have to do with her being white, blond, attractive, highly publicized and immensely talented. Up to this juncture, her strengths have been her rich, smokey vocal interpretations of, mostly, jazz/pop standards and her brilliant piano styling. Now Krall has suddenly become a triple threat. All it took, apparently was for her to exchange vows and rings with Elvis Costello and she is now a compelling and accomplished songwriter, as well. Half the songs here are Krall-Costello collaborations-mostly haunting, brooding, melodically complex, lyrically suggestive songs which require the most focus and patience. Nevertheless, they reveal another intriguing facet of Ms. Krall and clearly elevate her talents to another plateau. Meanwhile, she (and her regular crew of crackerjack jazz virtuosos) continues to do great work with the material of others including Tom Waits, Joni Mitchell, Mose Allison and her hubby. But it is her rendition of Chris Smither's (via Bonnie Raitt) bluesy nugget 'Love Me Like a Man' which shows still another side of Ms. Krall-sexy, ballsy and fun. Elvis, apparently, not only has great taste in music but collaborators, as well.
B000001ESP|5.0|This album is seen as one of, if not RUsh's best album and also as the transition between their first few CDs (which were more hard/prog rockish) and their more experimental future albums. Much of the praise that this album gets is well deserved as many of Rush's classics come from this album. <BR>     Since this is a Rush album, the excellent musicianship is obviously present. Neil Peart's drumming is amazing on this album as he creates complex rhythms and navigates the band's irregular time signatures with ease. Peart's lyrics are also interesting and thought provoking in some cases. Alex Lifeson's guitar playing is also top notch. He lays down some great solos and some classic riffs like the one in &quot;Limelight&quot;. The final member of the group, Geddy Lee is also amazing on bass. He creates many great basslines (as usual) like the one in the instrumental &quot;YYZ&quot;. He lays out some nice synthesizer parts too. His high pitched acquired taste vocals could take away from the album for some but I think they fit the music fine. They are more tolerable than those on some previoius albums which were even more high pitched.<br />1. Tom Sawyer: This is the most popular song off this album. It deals with independence and individuality. I really like the bass parts and the drums in this song. The song is quite catchy. Definitely one of my favorites off this album. Classic Rush. 10/10<br />2. Red Barchetta: This 6 minute song is also one of my favorites. The lyrics are about a future society/govt. that bans the use of cars. The character in the story is going joy riding in his Uncle's hidden car. The music is very good as are the lyrics. I like the vocal melodies as well. Great song 9.5/10 <br />3. YYZ: This instrumental starts out with Peart tapping out morse code on his cymbal. The song then moves into a dissonant section before transitioning into its main melody. The extremely cathcy bass lines are really superb in this song. They pretty much dominate the muchof song before the guitar solo.  There are many mini bass and drum solos throughout the songs as well. Extremely catchy. Another favorite and Rush classic. 10/10<br />4. Limelight: Another amazing song. The lyrics are about fame. The opening guitar riff is superb and is extremely catchy. Probably the best on the album. I like the vocal melodies a lot too. ANother one of the big hits from this album. 10/10<br />5. The Camera Eye: This song is the first not so good song on the album. It is about 11 minutes long. I definitely did not give this song much of a chance and I should listen to it again. I just don't care for really long epics so much unless i find them really interesting. I think some of the guitar parts were catchy. The lyrics are about New York and London possibly. 7/10<br />6.Witch Hunt: Pretty good song. There is a sample of some sort of mob. Next is a nice synthesizer part that I think they got a guest to do. The music is dark as are the lyrics. The song is part of the &quot;Fear&quot; trilogy. Neil Peart said in an interview that it was about how fear leads to mob mentality. The lyrics are quite cautionary. It is semi political and seems left leaning. Not one of the best songs but still pretty good. Good lyrics. 8/10<br />Vital Signs: I didn't like this one. Sounds a bit reggaeish. I didn't really appreciate this one. It's OK. 5/10<br />Overall, I reccomend this album. The first half is really top notch but the last three songs were a bit less compelling. I give this five stars more or less because the first 4 songs were so good.

B00005JMUA|5.0|They say that art mimics life, and vise versa. It's all about mirrors, and how we see ourselves in them. What one person sees might not be the exact same thing that another sees, but the general visual is still retained. Every detail altered to perfection, or skewed, pending on the eyes of the viewer. This can be said about the saga that is Kill Bill. Everyone who watches this film might not catch all the great references, and tributes, but rest assured, everyone will walk away more pleased than they have with a film in ages. <br />When we last left our intrepid heroine she was two notches into her \\"Death List Five\\" with three remaining, the last name on that list being the title name, Bill. We witnessed the Bride, codenamed Black Mamba (real name unknown, but discovered), take on an entire Japanese Yakuza clan, the best in all of Tokyo, and win. We felt her \\"mercy\\" towards another that had betrayed her, and the wicked life that remained. Oaths were broken, and lives were shattered. The gloves have now come off. <br />Those going into Volume 2 expecting more violence are going to be sadly misplaced. This is where the film really begins for the viewer. True, there are some great fight scenes, but every one of them are right to the point, no messing around this time. Is this a negative thing? Not at all. With those three names remaining on the List, we can expect some action true, but we now need the back story as to where we are now. <br />We are rightly thrust at the very beginning of the picture to the fabled scene at the chapel. We meet the Groom, and get a glimpse at the life the Bride wanted into. This is where we actually get our first look at the Bride's ex-lover, whom she introduces in quite the fashionable manner. This is where the story turns sour for the yellow-haired warrior. Sadly, we all know the outcome of that chapter of this tale. <br />The story from there is quite entertaining, spawning numerous chuckles at the hands of Mr. Blonde himself, MichaelMadsen. It is interesting to see the lives of the Deadly Vipers now that they have become defunct. A man of Budd's skill should be quite able to be well off in life, but then again, determination is always a factor. He feels that they should die for what they have done, but then again...Where this takes the journey, expected, but all shall be pleased. <br />We are given a glimpse into the training of Black Mamba at the hands of Pai Mei, the Fist of the White Lotus Clan. It is here we listen to the most entertaining fireside tale created in ages, and where we hear about the Legend of Pai Mei and his 5 Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique. To hear this attack described alone, shall make you fear it. The scene will make you shake with laughter at the style in which it is completed. The grain and texture of the visuals mixed with Gordon Liu's (he also played Johnny Mo, General of the Crazy 88's in Volume One) stylized presentation of Pai Mei is one of the finest treats of film nostalgia. <br />The final confrontation itself is not one that will have the feel that you think. It becomes this truly emotional roller coaster. Bill describes to us what it is we all aspire to be in our lives, a cunning use of Tarentino's observance of the modern myths. It is there we find ourselves questioning the journey. In the end, all good things, and people, find their conclusion, even if it isn't quite the one they (or we) wanted. <br />The visuals have a much grittier feel this time around, and do not give us a comic, greater than life, impression. We can actually see the things that happen in this installment, actually happen, to some degree of course. The cinematography will not let the audience down, have no fear. QT has always had a great eye, maybe it once belonged to Elle, and he really puts is to the finest use. <br />One thing that was extremely noteworthy of Volume One was its soundtrack/score. There are certain emotions that can only be brought about when the right audio is combined with the visual, and QT has it down to science. Again, the score reflects this chapters mood and intentions, but it isn't the fast-paced, high energy sound of the first. We hear from a good friend, the Man in Black, Johnny Cash, as well as Robert Rodriguez, who brings us some quality vibes, along with the RZA once more. <br />The acting is far beyond anything we have seen yet. David Carradine is the treat, in all honesty. His wisdom of the world is brought to us through Bill, and in turn we learn from the man we want to hate, but find it hard to. Uma Thurman's voyage through the character she helped to create is sublime. She brings about the best and the worst characteristics of this ill-lived woman, and brings about bloody satisfaction in a way unlike anyone else. When the two share the light, the love that exudes is easily over-whelming, but at the same time quite underplayed. <br />Be prepared. This might be the best thing you will see in a long time. In a world where all we see in the theatres are re-hashed ideas, sequels, and adapted films, this saga is the freshest thing sent to us in quite a long time. What has been witnessed will truly be a movie that will outlive the bounds and limits of the cinema around it, and set new standards, new obstacles. Get ready to complete the journey, and bear witness to mercy unlike any other, at the hands of Black Mamba, assassin supreme of the DiVA'S, the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad!
B0001HAHXW|2.0|This album is quite a treat! We all know Clapton from his numerous albums and hit songs over the last few years, so his appearance on this album is not too surprising. His guitar work on &quot;Me &amp; Mr. Johnson&quot; (aka &quot;Mr Johnson &amp; I&quot; if you're hip) is smooth and jazzy, like Al Dimeola riffing after hours with Dave Koz. I almost think that I'm sipping lemonade at the country fair whenever I listen to it. &quot;Little Queen of Spades&quot; is a lonely plea to a lost lover, whose gender is ambiguous in the lyrics, in true modern-songwriting fashion. This politically correct CD should appeal to everyone except Bill Mahr.  &quot;They're Red Hot&quot; is a cogent reminder about the perils of eating tamales as well as playing with fireworks (the latter is my interpretation). Believe me, when EC says &quot;They're Red Hot&quot; I believe him! Hear ye, hear ye, I say to that. <br />The real treat on this album is the reappearance of Billy Preston as Clapton's sideman. Adding him to the group is like having additional insurance, and those who know about Preston's former legal issues know all about his unique expertise with regard to insurance. What most people don't know is that Preston is the &quot;Mr Johnson&quot; to which Clapton refers in the title. Even though the songs are covers of tunes by the really old singer Robert Johnson (who has been a friend of mine for years--he lives in Seattle these days), we all know that Clapton has referred to Preston as &quot;Mr. Johnson&quot; (aka &quot;Reptile&quot;) for years. It is an immense sign of respect, and we all know that fans of postmodernism dig talking about &quot;signs.&quot; I really hope He continues to be a fixture in Clapton's group, because He may be the factor that takes Clapton's new music and &quot;kicks it up a notch&quot; Emeril-style. (I talked to Robert the other day, and he wants Preston to continue being in the group too.) If you like this album, you should check out Preston's other albums; you will not be disappointed. <br />However, since He is such a strong presence on this album (which isn't bad--duh, He IS &quot;Mr. Johnson&quot;) this doesn't come off as being a &quot;true&quot; Clapton album. If you like the classic sound of Clapton, you should listen to his non-Preston/&quot;Mr. Johnson&quot; collaborations. Therefore this album is really a 3 star album: 5 stars for Preston, but only 1 star for Clapton. But because I don't usually like to encourage such efforts (I like to make people work a little) I'll settle on 2 stars because maybe it will motivate EC a little bit. He is rich, after all, and could probably use a little motivation to get the &quot;eye of the Tiger&quot; back just like Rocky had against Clubber Lang. I've always found that people do a better job when you give 'em the &quot;World Series of Poker&quot; type of treatment. As Kenny used to say (and Robert tells me this all the time too), &quot;you gotta know when to hold 'em and know when to fold 'em.&quot; What is so clever about that line is that it rhymes with Texas Hold 'Em. Awesome.

B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's first CD is a good one for a first start.  The songs are catchy, and most are full of heart.  It is very easy to mold what she is saying into something you can relate to.  This is a really good CD.
B00005T30L|3.0|There is a very, very interesting generation of young actresses in Hollywood. Not only they are pretty, but also they are very talented, and they usually choose to appear in independent movies rather than appear in summer Blockbusters. That generation includes interesting actresses like Sarah Polley, Christina Ricci, Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson, to name a few. Luckily in &quot;Ghost World&quot; appear Thora and Scarlett.<br />When &quot;Ghost World&quot; was released, a lot of people, included myself, were impressed with Thora Birch, a young actress with a unique beauty and talent. So after I saw her in &quot;American Beauty&quot;, I couldn't wait to see her in another movie, and that film is &quot;Ghost World&quot;, an independent movie that explores in an unique way the complex transition of the teenage days to the &quot;real world&quot;.<br />&quot;Ghost World&quot; has a very talented cast, in addition to Thora, we can find Scarlett Johansson and Steve Buscemi. Scarlett steals the show in &quot;Ghost World&quot;, obviously it was expected to be Thora's movie, but Scarlett is very solid in this movie and she got the attention of other independent filmmakers like Sofia Coppola, two years later, Sofia Coppola cast Scarlett to appear in &quot;Lost In Translation&quot;, so &quot;Ghost World&quot; was the &quot;commercial&quot; breakthrough of Scarlett. Plus, she is gorgeous. <br />Steve Buscemi, another independent spirit, also steals a lot of scenes in &quot;Ghost World&quot;, we know him very well from other films like &quot;Fargo&quot; or &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;. With such acting talent, &quot;Ghost World&quot; is a must-see. The movie offers a unique point of view of the teenage world, this is not your regular &quot;American Pie&quot; movie, so I recommend &quot;Ghost World&quot; to fans of independent cinema.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This was the first album from Dream Theater that I bought. I had heard that John Petrucci was an amazing guitarist who never fails to include a lengthy and incredible solo. You see I had just bought Contraband by Velvet Revolver, and while it was a very good album, Slash (who when he is given something to work with is just as good as Petrucci) only has two good solos. Train of Thought was kind of misleading because the sound featured on here is nothing like their big albums &quot;Images &amp; Words&quot; and &quot;Metropolis Pt. 2.&quot; This album is has a dark, heavy sound and Petrucci's rhythym guitar work sounds similar to Korn, Limp Bizkit, and System of a Down, but unlike those bands, this music is never noise but is impressive throughout.<br />1. As I Am 10/10- The radio single from the CD never received any airtime. A quiet intro gets louder and goes into LaBrie's pounding lyrics. &quot;From the doubtful I demand, TAKE ME AS I AM!&quot; is the highlight of this song, but has good performances by the entire band.<br />2. This Dying Soul 9/10- Over 11:00 long, never gets boring. Has a long band jam that features many solos by both Rudess and Petrucci. The only problem is that the song sounds more like two or three songs because there are no smooth transitions between solos.<br />3. Endless Sacrifice 10/10- Another song over 11:00 long, but has another lengthy instrumental section with a great playing by Petrucci and Portnoy, but Rudess shows how amazing he is with his keyboard work.<br />4. Honor Thy Father 6/10- Has a sound like Korn or Limp Bizkit with rap-like lyrics and guitar solos that are more noise than pleasure. Portnoy and Myung help this song and make it somewhat worthwhile.<br />5. Vacant 10/10- All by itself would get maybe a seven, but is set up as an intro to &quot;Stream of Consciousness.&quot; Features Eugene Friesen on cello and has haunting vocals by LaBrie.<br />6. Stream of Consciousness 10/10- An instrumental song and THE only song EVER MADE that would still get a perfect score if the grades were out of 100 instead of ten. Incredible perfomances make an eleven minute song seem like 3 minutes and leaves the listener wishing it could go on forever. John Myung on bass takes the spotlight on this one with a great solo, but Petrucci has at least five solos, all PERFECT, Rudess and Portnoy are amazing too but do not have any solos, but don't let that fool you, they are just as evident as Petrucci is. Possibly the best song EVER made by Dream Theater.<br />7. In the Name of God 10/10- If &quot;Stream of Consciousness&quot; is Dream Theater's best song ever, than this takes a close second. The political lyrics may turn some off, but LaBrie delivers a heartfelt performance, and the lyrics don't come off as phony or false. Has another long instrumental section that is EXCEPTIONAL. Is over 14:00 long, but again seems like 3 or 4 minutes. Pounding guitar, bass, and drums at the end fade away into Rudess' piano solo, and is similar to the ending of Faith No More's &quot;Epic,&quot; but this is much much better.<br />Once again Dream Theater proves that they have more talent in Petrucci's finger than do every other band combined that was formed after the grunge revolution. (Except for Velvet Revolver, they are really good, but no contest when compared to Dream Theater). This is a MUST HAVE for any Dream Theater fan, even with the heavier sound. For people just getting into Dream Theater, buy images and Words first, then get Train of Thought. You will not be disappointed.
B00005YU1O|4.0|&quot;Waking Life&quot; is an experimental film, it combines dreamy, atmospheric animation with philosophy and animated cameos. The film doesn't have a linear plot, as a matter of fact it doesn't have a plot at all, because &quot;Waking Life&quot; it's a collection of individual segments, each one of them contains a monologue, or sometimes a collective speech about existential topics.<br />By the way, since &quot;Waking Life&quot; offers many points of view about a lot of existential topics, there will be some opinions that you will agree with, and other opinions that you won't agree, and that's part of the charm of the movie. &quot;Waking Life&quot; doesn't want to tell you the truth about the human being, &quot;Waking Life&quot; invites the audience to think, to form an individual opinion about the different elements of our existences. So yes, &quot;Waking Life&quot; requires an active audience.<br />The movie discusses a lot of elements: God, the dreams, the individuality of each person, the existence of the human being, among many others. &quot;Waking Life&quot; offers a lot to talk or think about, so this is a fascinating film, because sometimes the speeches get so complicated or complex that you constantly are trying to solve the puzzle in your mind.<br />Visually &quot;Waking Life&quot; is one of the most daring animated films that I have ever seen, you think that Disney will ever make a movie like this one? Obviously not. This is independent cinema at its best. Once in a while it's refreshing to see unique movies like this one, the director and writer Richard Linklater did a great job with &quot;Waking Life&quot;.
B0001HAISG|4.0|The latest film version of \\"Peter Pan\\" is a very fine rendition of the J. M. Barrie classic - which celebrates its centenary this year - all about the boy who refuses to grow up and the young girl who almost makes him change his mind.  Everyone is clearly familiar with the tale of Wendy and her two brothers who are magically whisked away to a place called Neverland, inhabited by pirates, fairies and a group of scruffy lads known as \\"The Lost Boys,\\" of whom Peter Pan is the valiant leader.  In this particular adaptation, it is the marvelous attention to detail - in setting, design, costumes and special effects - that makes the movie soar.<br />The scenes set in Edwardian London have a lovely \\"Mary Poppins\\" look and feel to them, while those set in Neverland have the otherworldly quality needed to bring such fantasies to life.  Indeed, from first moment to last, the film is a visual feast, a masterpiece of image, design, and sheer technical wizardry.<br />Equally important, writer/director P. J. Hogan never allows the technical aspects of the film to overwhelm the characters, conflicts and themes that have made this story such a universal favorite for nigh unto five generations of enraptured children.  The relationship between Peter and Wendy achieves a surprising emotional depth thanks to the two fine young actors, Jeremy Sumpter and Rachel Hurd-Wood, whose job it is to bring these beloved characters to life.  There's a particularly enchanting scene in which Peter and Wendy dance in the air, spinning high above the trees against an impossibly huge painted moon (shades of \\"E.T.,\\" the ultimate \\"Peter Pan\\" tribute).  Yet, the film is also not afraid to explore some of the darker themes inherent in the material.  I am speaking here not merely of the swordfights, deaths and malevolent villains (Jason Isaacs makes a splendid Captain Hook) but also of the strangely tragic nature of Peter Pan himself, a boy unable to feel as others do and unable to take his place in the natural scheme of things - being a member of a family, maturing into manhood, falling in love.  Eternal youth may be something we all dream about and yearn for from time to time, but it comes with a price we might not, in those moments of cold sober reality, be willing to pay.  As a result of confronting this paradox, the film possesses a bittersweet flavor that helps to dilute some of the treacle and sugary sentiment that could otherwise have taken over the story.  Also helpful is the dry British wit that runs all throughout the screenplay.<br />It's become something of a clich&eacute; to describe a film as \\"fine fun for the entire family,\\" but, trite as it may be, that phrase does indeed apply to \\"Peter Pan.\\"  This film is a genuine treat - whether you're eternally young or not.ural scheme of things - being a member of a family, maturing into manhood, falling in love.

B00006F83Y|5.0|If your like Kane Taylor(UK) you bought this cd beacause of no one knows, just like any other commercial music lover. If the song wasn't on MTV its not good. Wrong don't be like Kane Taylor Songs For The Death is a great cd. It's unique I can distinguish any Queens Of The Stone Age song from any other death metal song or any other type of song. This cd is filled with great riffs and cool song ideas. All the songs are good because there all different unlike staind's stuff for example. The radio talk through the album gives it its mellow feel. Anyone who is a fan of real music or alternative should at least give this cd a chance its an experience. This One of my favorite cd's.
B000002MUW|5.0|well i'd have to say that this is my favorite madonna cd ever. i feel that this cd is very diverse, making it a pleasurable listen throughout. the cd starts off with more dancey-like tracks such as &quot;i'd rather be your lover&quot; and &quot;don't stop&quot; and moves on to slower ballads including &quot;inside of me&quot; and &quot;forbidden love&quot;... this cd just has it all! just when you think madonna is all in love and &quot;missing that special someone&quot;, well you are greeted with the famous &quot;human nature&quot; a track that does not fail to show yet another side of madonna; that of an outspoken strong woman... you can feel r&amp;b influences [thanks to many contributions with babyface] as well as pop, but this cd also has the amazing track &quot;bedtime story&quot; with its techno-ambient feel [bjork being one of the co-writers of the song...mmm makes sense?] this track is arguably one of the most &quot;different&quot; type of song madonna had ever done at that point in her career [&quot;ray of light&quot; is another story]...<br />all in all i think that anyone who enjoys a true good mix of music all in one cd will enjoy this work to the fullest! whatever be your mood, pop this in and enjoy!
0790729652|1.0|Laughable special effects, especially for a movie that came out in the 90's, Robot Jocks had better effects. Watch where the joker falls off the building, and where the bat plane crashes, I think the fire is done with cigarettes. Choreography is lame, like at the end where a guy jumps over Batman's head  then goes falling through the floor. Batman doesn't use his intellect or detective skills really, just goes charging in to battles, he almost gets killed twice while out of costume.  It doesn't make sense that batman tries to tell Vicky Vale his secret identity. \\"Yeah, this'll make her respect me<br />\\".  I can imagine him in front of a mirror practicing \\"I'm Batman\\". He also endangers innocent civilians in a car chase(...). What's up with her wardrobe?(glasses), and the guy reporter is an annoying geek. The batsuit is more powerful than the batplane? Batman is shot about 15 times through the course of the movie (twice without the suit), but all it takes is one shot to bring down the plane, i guess because it's moving towards the bullet at such a speed. An aluminum tray also provides stronger armor than the batplane according to tihs movie.
B00005OMTT|5.0|i have to admit that at first i didn't think that it would be necessary to purchase this enigma greastest hits compilation. i mean especially when you're a fan who already has all their cds, what would be the point of doing so? well i have to say i was wrong! i purchased this cd and was not the least bit disappointed! for one thing, it has various remixed tracks, such as &quot;tnt for the brain&quot; and i must say the track on this cd far exceeds the original one found on enigma's third album &quot;le roi est mort, vive le roi.&quot; in my personal opinion, &quot;tnt for the brain&quot; is reason enough to buy this greatest hits compilation, so amazing this song really is!! i also love how all the songs flow nicely into one another, so you feel as though it is one long ride through time; no pauses in between to distract you from your voyage! :) i'd have to say, the one thing that usually &quot;bothered&quot; me about enigma cds was how they never really exceeded an hour... well this cd definitely surpasses that time period, and does so wonderfully... if you are a true fan of enigma, you won't regret making this purchase! enjoy!!<br />+ in nomine Christi, Amen +
B00005QIPH|5.0|Considering the enormous amount of hype the came attached with this album on its first release, it's interesting to see several years on if it still stands up to closer scrutiny.  And surprisingly the answer is an emphatic `Yes'.  The raw paired down sound, still feels vital and self-assured, energetic and anxious.  Tracks such as \\"Is This it\\" &amp; \\"Last Nite\\" still brim with a confident swagger from a band that were yet to truly establish themselves as a viable act.  \\"Alone Together\\" &amp; \\"Trying your luck\\" express the more contemplative side to the band, that dismissed critics arguements that the band were a pastiche of new wave 80's bands like \\"Blondie\\", \\"The Police\\"....(although I'll concede that the band are obvious admirers of \\"the Velvet Underground\\").  Even though the songs that weren't released as singles and make up the rest of the album (\\"Trying Your luck\\", Take it or leave it\\", \\"Someday\\"), still remain impressive even today, and more importantly their knack with an infectious melody appears to be no one off!!!  And although the jerky guitars, Convulsive drumming and exuberant sneer of vocalist \\"Julian Casablancas'\\" urgent singing, has since been copied a thousand times over since the release of this debut.  Many people will still come here, to find the answers to the raw, revealing and minimal production values, that were able to make the mainstream (mostly) sit up and notice.<br />Nobody here is trying to pretend that what Casablancas and Co, were trying to do is original or new.....because those with a keen ear will hear different influences peppered throughout the album (I myself seem to hear a tangible influence from \\"Blondie\\" &amp; \\"Velvet underground\\"), but what they did make is a indie rock/ Garage rock revival album that does actually stand up, after all the huge hype following its initial release.  Ironically for an album that is a fantastically realised and impressive performed, with that air a Art-rock cool, that separates a mediocre act, from something impressive....my fave track that was removed from the U.S. version (but included in the U.K. release) \\"New York City Cops\\" for me......encapsulates everything that is special about the Storkes.  Funny, urgent, impeccably performed, and sneeringly cool, the band made a debut that whether they ever scale these heady heights again is debatable, but for now, lets enjoy one of 2001's most remarkable albums.
B00004YM0D|5.0|I love the music on this CD. Hey I love the movie. Their both great.
0789723107|5.0|This book should be required reading for not only web designers, but anyone who owns a website. The book was a bit on the thin side and when I got it I thought it should have been thicker for the money. I was wrong. <br />This book takes you through every facet of usability and is as applicable to a single person with one site as it is to a multi-level corporation who owns 30 sites. His writing style is fun and humorous and the book is an easy read.
B00005RRG9|4.0|I love this movie. Both versions arwe great. The first one, with Haley Mills, has the song,&quot;lets get together yeah yeah yeah, why don't you and I combine..&quot; and the second one with Lindsay Lohan, has the song &quot;There She Goes&quot; And there are some other diffrences. Like in the new one, there is the lizard fiasco. I'm pretty sure that wasn't in the old one. But they are both good. if I wer you I wouldn't chose. I'd get both.:)
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Yes, it's just a couple people wandering around pointlessly, there isn't much plot, and it's not ALWAYS a particularly accurate portrayal of Japanese.  But, it's quite funny and fun to watch, like taking a cool vactation vicariously.  I like the ending because it manages to make it not sad, without being hollywood hokey crap.  I imagine people who don't like this movie drive SUVs, and are wasting oxygen by breathing.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|So, this is my first Slipknot cd. I heard a lot of things about this band. Some negative, some positive. Mostly negative though. Anyways, I decided to ignore what everyone else said and went and picked up this album. I think its an awesome album. I don't know people don't like this band...but everyone's different.<br />Some of my favorite songs are: &quot;Welcome&quot;, &quot;Three Nil&quot; and &quot;Duality&quot;.
B0001ZX0OM|5.0|It has been awhile since a film numbed me but that was the feeling I had at the end of &quot;Mystic River&quot;.  This is an intensive psychological murder mystery.  It is a roller coaster ride that starts out fast and never slows down.  This is a movie that explores the lives of three men deeply (in degrees) affected by a savage event of their youth.  As we see them as adults, we note the different directions that their lives have led and how they become intertwined again.  The development of the numerous essential characters in the story is outstanding yet it is done so well that the action never seems to slow down.  The acting is superb with special kudos to Sean Penn who seemed to reach new heights in his already impressive career.  There is such an array of subtlety, innuendo and shock that special recognition has to be paid to the Director; Clint Eastwood.  I know that he has directed before and won the Academy Award for &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;.  However, this movie has set a new standard for him as well.  The editing somehow missed an Oscar nomination but I can't see why in as much as the movie moves along so well.  If there is a criticism, it would be the ending.  I have no dispute with how the movie ends, I just think it falls a bit short of everything that led up to it.  I have not read the book but, knowing that the book is usually better than the movie, I'll certainly have to in this case.  This is not a movie for the whole family since the subject matter is probably too intense and, hopefully, incomprehensible for pre and early teens.  The violence and profanity is not over done as seems to happen so often these days.  This is a complex story told in a kaleidescope of imagery.  We get to know most all of the characters in such a way as to be involved in their pain and suffering.  The spouse of Dave is especially pathetic in a moving manner.  I don't necessarily watch movies to become emotionally exhausted.  However, when it happens, I know I have seen a work of art.
0783225857|5.0|...<br />...the film adaptation has come down throughout my life less as a reminder of what it was like to roam through the wonders, fears, and frustrations of early youth than in Gregory Peck's magnificent depiction of what is expected of a man - as a professional, as a citizen, and as a father.<br />It is to the model set by my own father and to the portrayal of Atticus Finch in this film that I owe much of what has been good in the fulfillment of my duty to my community, to my patients, and to the children and grandchildren who were born into my responsibility.<br />If there is anything solid or valuable in the moral character of the male American &quot;Baby Boomer,&quot; it is attributable in at least some small way to the influence of this movie and the expectations it impressed upon us, consciously or unconsciously, in the darkened movie theaters of 1962 and 1963.
0553573403|5.0|What is more unbelievable than how good this book is, is how many negative reviews I've read from people who just didn't get it.  If you are a fan of the prefabricated, predictable fantasy, then steer clear.  I actually read a negative review that said \\"road of the hero\\" or some such bunk.  Why do we demand that all books have a singular hero, developing into an undefeatable force, that you know is going to save the world in the end.  God forbid we subject ourselves to a little suspense and a little reality.<br />Someone else wrote that Martin uses every cliche in the book.  Are you kidding me?  This whole style is so far from cliche, it's not even funny.<br />There have been concerns over the graphic sex and violence.  Folks, if you are over 20 and have been off the farm (and I grew up on one) for more than a few months, there is nothing here that should shock you.  Jeez, Anne Rice's vampire novels are worse than this.<br />You can tell how much I love this book and this series by my defense of it.  The bottom line is if you don't like it fine, but not even giving it a try is the worst literature mistake you'll ever make.
B000089RVX|2.0|I heard about this great new band, so I wanted to give them a listen, as I am constantly on the lookout for anything that's new and, especially, good. Once was more than enough though; they sound like highschool students trying to make a pizza for the first time with all the wrong ingredients. Absolutely without relevance or substance. Not poisonous, but I'm keeping my distance. Two stars because they honestly tried to make a good pizza; but they just haven't got what it takes to become three star chefs. Next please...
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|people are just HATING on this group. I don't know why, but i never even heard the first album and i like this one better. They did a good job cuz the beats are tight. The song loyalty is so good and so true. They talk about real sh^t and that's why they get 5 stars.
B0001MDP3G|4.0|Almost everything about this movie was beautiful - Jude Law was wonderful as Inman, Nicole Kidman was exquisite in her role and perfect portrayel of Ada Monroe (although too blonde!), Renee Zellwegger landed the plum interesting role of Ruby and did beautifully with it, Kathy Baker was superb... as was most everyone else.  The cinematography was gorgeous.  <BR>BUT the entire movie was ruined by the lousy ending.  It made the whole movie a waste of my time.  I have no interest in investing my time (and money) for a huge disappointment at the end.<BR>Does everyone who gives out awards think somebody has to die in order for a film to be considered good?
B0000TLA9G|3.0|One of the best 80's rock bands was GNR and mostly likely agruable having one of the best albums in &quot;appetite for destruction&quot;.  However, this greatest hits is average in missing at least 4 or 5 great songs that should have been on it.  Where is night train, rocket queen, get in the ring, pretty tied up, etc?  I was disappointed when I saw the track lisiting as well you should before buying. If you are a fan then you already know the GNR has just 4 worthy albums that should be in your collection and personaly I would have NOT bothered with this one unless having the stones cover of &quot;sympathy for the devil&quot; was that important (also on Interview with a Vampire soundtrack) Bottom line buy appetite, lies, use your illusions 1 &amp; 2.  GNR rocks!
B00005JMEW|1.0|Beyond stupid. I'm a big fan of action movies but I like somewhat realistic stuff. This...Too much animation, bad acting(just like one of the reviewers said) and whole thing appeared to have been written by a 12 year old boy.
6305212112|5.0|I'm always surprised how badly great storytelling makes it to the screen. Particularly, great Southern stories, which tend to make it to the big screen replete with caricatures and stereotypes. I recall, with particular sadness, the movie adaptation of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. While this adaptation to the screen of Flagg's tremendously moving novel does have its share of simple, stereotypical southern \\"archetypes\\", these are largely drawn from Flagg's book, and are largely essential to the story. It is, without a doubt, one of the most enjoyable movies I have ever seen and, ten years after first seeing it, it still brings raucous laughter and tears to my eyes. It's the classic \\"story within the story\\", and begins with the introduction of a tenacious elderly widow to a repressed younger southern housewife in a nursing home in rural Alabama. What starts off to the housewife as polite and indulgent small talk of past acquaintances with a likely senile elderly woman turns rapidly into an engrossing story with what must be the best \\"hook line\\" in storytelling (\\"Why anybody would have thought she killed that man is beyond me!\\"). This story then becomes a parable which the housewife uses to change her life for the better.<br />While certainly a moral parable of the greater value systems of past times, and of loyalty and courage in the face of bigotry and oppression, the story never loses its infectious humor, despite some genuinely tragic events. The lesbian theme of the book is only mildly hinted at, and one would almost overlook it were one not to deliberately search for it. Some of the more brutal aspects of the book are retained, with the rampant racism and wife-abuse still harrowingly reflected, if toned down. Consequently, younger viewers may best appreciate the film in the company of an adult. Regardless, this is one of the best \\"feeling good\\" movies I have ever seen, and being a Southerner from an area very near that depicted in the book, makes me pine for the South in profound ways. It's a film about empowerment and, more importantly, the empowerment one gains through friends, and through standing up for one's friends, and through an unshakable belief in self-respect.<br />No little credit for the success of the film goes to the incredibly strong performances of Masterson as the tom-boyish Idgie Threadgood, and Marie Louise-Parker as Ruth Jamison, along with the underrated performance of Stan Shaw, one of TV's great character actors, as Big George. However, the film's strongest performances come from three grande dames of the screen (and stage): Cicely Tyson, as Sissy, Jessica Tandy, as Ninny Threadgood, and Kathy Bates, as Evelyn Couch. While Tandy and Bates have received their due, Tyson's performance, as always, is often overlooked.
0778320448|4.0|The shop in THE SHOP ON BLOSSOM STREET is a yarn shop on a quiet Seattle street that is just on the cusp of gentrification. The shop itself is not merely a backdrop for the plot of Debbie Macomber's sweet new novel; it's also the catalyst that brings together four dissimilar women and helps them weave together a friendship out of the different-colored threads of their lives.<br />For each of the four women, knitting represents the fulfillment of a wish or dream. For Carol Girard, it's the overwhelming desire to have a child. When Carol hears about the new yarn shop on Blossom Street and learns that the beginning knitting class will be knitting a baby blanket, she knows it's a sign. Carol and her husband have tried for years to conceive a child; now, about to undergo their third in vitro procedure, their time and insurance dollars are running out. Carol has given up so much to have a child --- her normal fast-paced routine, even the high-stress job she loves --- and she hopes that knitting can also fill empty hours in her new slower-paced lifestyle.<br />For Jacqueline Donovan, it's the hope that she can be a good grandmother despite her loathing for her daughter-in-law. Jacqueline, a fixture at the country club and charity events, has been in a loveless marriage for years. She claims to despise Tammie Lee because she's southern, blonde and ditzy --- in reality, though, Jacqueline is jealous of the obvious love that exists between her son and Tammie Lee. At her husband's request, Jacqueline enrolls in the beginning knitting class, hoping she can knit a baby blanket as a peace offering.<br />Alix Townsend, the youngest member of the group, also seems the least likely knitter. She signs up for the beginning knitting class in the hopes that donating her baby blanket for charity can knock off some of her court-mandated community service hours; secretly, though, knitting is part of Alix's fantasy of a mother she never had. She hopes that by taking up knitting she can recapture some of the nurturing she missed out on as a child. Rebellious and bitter, Alix rubs just about everyone the wrong way until they discover her vulnerability and kindness, hidden under her dyed hair and black leather.<br />Most poignant of the four women in THE SHOP ON BLOSSOM STREET is Lydia Hoffman, the owner of the yarn shop. For Lydia, knitting in general and owning a yarn shop in particular symbolizes life, a life she couldn't imagine just a few years ago. Having survived two bouts of brain cancer, Lydia never expected to live to thirty, let alone to open her own business. Lydia says, &quot;The shop was my affirmation of life.&quot; Although Lydia has taken a leap of faith by opening her yarn shop, she is less courageous when it comes to romance.<br />With their varying backgrounds and different agendas, it's not surprising that these four women clash when they come together for their first knitting class. Jacqueline and Alix, in particular, are at each other's throats from the start. It's also no surprise that over the course of the summer, these four women form a close bond of friendship that is tested when tragedy threatens one of their own. The characters, despite their emotional development, are not really developed beyond their initial preoccupations. However, it's a rare novel that manages to be sweet without becoming syrupy, and THE SHOP ON BLOSSOM STREET achieves that balance.<br />Both knitters and non-knitters will find much to enjoy here. Knitters have a bonus: a free baby blanket pattern (the same one the characters learn to knit) is included at the start of the novel, and quotes from well-known knitters are scattered throughout. Non-knitters can still find many pleasures in this satisfying, if somewhat predictable, tale. And who knows --- maybe Lydia and her friends will inspire readers to take up needles themselves!<br />   --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl
B00005Q66Y|5.0|(but isn't)<br />the best recording of any Bruckner Symphony for 2 Decades!<br />This recording speaks so very directly to the listener, grabs one, brings Bruckner (beware of the clichee:) to life. Bruckner like on this disk cannot but enchant even the most reluctant listeners.<br />read no more: if you like Bruckner or think you might like bruckner, go get this record!<br />off on a tangent:<br />I decided some years ago, that I was to like Bruckner. Thus I started and continued to acquire his symphonies, his masses etc. - but all along, I had never been sure if there was ever an emotional connection between me and the old catholic.<br />My rationalization was that Bruckner was music for those who regretted that Wagner had never written a symphony. That didn't suffice to fall in love with Bruckner (aside, early dvorak is a much better substitute) ... but i continued.<br />The I came across the live recordings of Guenther Wand on &lt;b&gt;RCA&lt;/b&gt; with the Berlin Philharmonic. His 4th and 9th spoke to me quite a bit, but perhaps only enough to turn some of my attention to this last german master of conductors.<br />Then i got Bruckner's 8th Symphony with Hans Knappertsbusch and later with Riccardo Chailly and the Concertgebouw. Nothing happened to me. In fact, in both cases I forgot that I had already bought a Bruckner 8th! (Quite frankly, I am not sure what accounts for the drastic difference to the Wand, because the Chailly is not noticeably flawed in any way... though somewhat sterile)<br />A few weeks later, as mentioned: having forgotten that i had gotten the Chailly recording, i got the 8th with Wand - and finally, it clicked.<br />the nitty-gritty:<br />given the impact this recording (one of some 1200 classical cd's i have) has made on me, it deserves a bit extra mentioning.<br />BBC3's (forgot his name) had the following to say:<br />&quot;He's [Guenther Wand] found a way of making Bruckner's Eighth Symphony communicate more directly, more emotionally. It's not enough here to sit back and be impressed with the structure and the sheer grandeur of the design - Wand demands a human, emotional response, recognition that it's not a heart of stone that keeps this music alive, and if anything the spiritual gains are greater.&quot;<br />I suppose this is precisely what I mean by: grabs you by the lapels. I put this CD in my player, going off to diddle around - alone, the music would not let me. It was not going to be relegated to the background. It didn't let you drift off. It demanded my attention but it made it easy for me, as well. By the time the first disc (it is sold as a single disc, but the piece fits only on two) is over, I could not get the second one into my CD-player quick enough.<br />This recording has since (I have become somewhat of an Evangelist about it) recruited three acquaintances of mine to Bruckner in the first place!.<br />Wand uses the original edition of the scorerather than than the novak edition which had been used more frequently and which is slightly shorter. (Thus more often fitting on one CD - though the format does not matter in this case as it doesn't affect the price)<br />Not being a musicologist, I can't say if it is at least in part the different version that makes this recording so outstanding... I will have to suppose that it is the combination of the musical and honest approach of Guenther Wand that lets it all come together like this.<br />Almost 90 years old when he recorded this symphony for the third time (it is his best account of it, despite two superlative earlier goes at it), Wand died soon thereafter. This recording was - and not for sentimental reasons - the Editor's Choice of the Month in Gramophone Magazine.<br />Because this work - and this recording thereof - deserves more and lavish attention, I shall be re-visiting this review. Perhaps I will add (in a second review, so as not to make this one unduly long) elaborate on the piece (the music) itself... until then, trust me: if Mahler, R. Strauss, Wagner scare you not... if bombastic late romantic music might be your liking, this is a jewel of which there are not many around.<br />jflhen, trust me: if Mahler, R. Strauss, Wagner scare you not... if bombastic late romantic music might be your liking, this is a jewel of which there are not many around.<br />jfl
B00005JMJ4|5.0|this is a beautiful film. Character rather than plot- driven, Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanssen convey with expression and gestures the emotions of sadness, despair, and attraction beautifully. The exotic setting and sparse dialogue render this a beautiful film. If you are looking for dialogue that tells you what to think and what the characters are thinking, this film is not for you. If you are a thinking man, however, this film will deeply move you. Well done, Sofia Coppola. I hope to see more from both her and these wonderful stars. The best film of 2003.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|This album wasn't as good as I thought it would be. There's many songs on here that have childish lyrics but from Avril herself being a child you really wouldn't expect much. I agree Avril really did mature on this album.<BR>1. Take Me Away-This is an OK song. The song itself is very good but Avril sounds like as if she's whining in this song. And again the lyrics aren't the best ones in the world. <BR>2. Together-This is the best song on the album. It's a very mature song except for the fact that at the end of the song Avril screams at the top of her lungs the word together totally destroying the whole song. But the song itself is very good.<BR>3. Don't Tell Me-Well most of you probably heard this song on the radio. It's an OK song except Avril sounds like she's trying to be tough in this song. It's a good pop song, I probably would buy the single.<BR>4. He Wasn't-This song is utterly annoying. The lyrics and the song sounds equivalent to Sk8er Boi. The lyrics are dumb, the song is dumb, you might like it if you enjoyed Sk8er Boi.<BR>5. How Does It Feel-I'm not really a fan of this song because I don't like slow songs. But this is one of the songs where you can see Avril has really matured. It's maybe like a adult-alternative song. It's alright.<BR>6. My Happy Ending-I like the beginning of this song but her voice is annoying in the chorus. She sounds like nails scratching across a chalkboard. The song itself is pretty good.<BR>7. Nobody's Home-I like this song. It has a nice feel to it. The lyrics are a bit better in this song, possibly because she co-wrote this song with Ben Moody from Evanescence. <BR>8. Forgotten-I like this song too. I just hate it in the beginning when she's doing the oh-ohs. She sounds like something got caught in her throat. But this is actually a rock song unlike all the rest of them. But Avril's voice makes the song sound childish still. Maybe if someone with a actual good voice like Brody Dalle's took over maybe it'd be a better song.<BR>9. Who Knows-I hate this song. I hate the chorus. The whole song sucks. The only thing Avril could've came up with in the chorus was...\\"Keep on laughing, one thing's true, tommorow's a brand new day\\" that part has nothing to do with the song! It sounds like Avril just wrote something down on paper just to get done.<BR>10. Freak Out-This sounds kind of childish too. There's nothing you could really compare this to, except maybe He Wasn't, I don't really like this song. But if you're a true Avril fan then I'm sure you'd like it.<BR>11. Slipped Away-Ehhh..this song's alright. There's nothing special to it. It's a slow song, it's kind of like How Does it Feel.<br />The only thing I could really say is. I do encourage you to buy this album. It's not a bad one, unlike her first album \\"Let Go\\". If you disliked \\"Let Go\\" then maybe you would like Under My Skin better. She totally changed her music into actual pop/rock. The only problems on this album are some of her singing here and there and the lyrics. But hey, leave it to Chantal Kreviazuk to co-write a whole album with another terrible lyricist.
B00008AY3L|5.0|Thank God for Mr. Harper.  He keeps getting better and better and stronger and stronger.  From the Reggae anthem of the first song, to the sheer beauty of the final song, everything on this album is brilliant.  What a great, great band he has.  They jam out and transition to acoustic so superbly.  Harper is a complex, genius of a songwriter who weaves wonderful tapestries throughout.<br />His politics, his religion, his insights sparkle like the diamonds he mentions.<br />The world is a better place with Ben Harper in the musical firmament.
B00005JMUA|5.0|If you are willing to let this two-part movie simply exhilarate you, then you will agree with me that it is one of the best movie experiences you've ever had. If you're going to try to analyze it by other means, you may not be wholly satisfied with it. <br />The two parts are perfect together, they complete each other, they need each other. The first part supplies us with some of the most visceral, thrilling action scenes I've ever seen in a movie, and I'm glad to have experienced that. But the second part made me love the whole all the more, deepening the characters and the story and the emotion enough to anchor this tale, so that what you're left with is a greatly satisfying whole. I wouldn't say that the first part is better than the second, or that the second part is better than the first. The two parts need and complement each other.<br />This is one of my all-time favorite movies. (And I don't, by the way, know a thing about the movies these are meant to pay homage to. There are probably a lot of little in-jokes that I don't get, but that doesn't lessen my enjoyment in the least.)
B0000TB050|5.0|This is the first video by U2 that I have ever purchased and I must say it is amazing. I was knocked out by this one! The sound quality is awesome, but U2 is what knocks me out. They are awesome live and Bono's voice is flawless here. Wake Up Dead Man gave me chills. The scenery is awesome with the Slane Castle in the background. Sometimes the castle glows orange and sometimes it glows blue. My only complaint would be that the camera got too close to Bono's face and nearly inside his mouth during a couple of songs. If I were Bono, I don't think I would have approved some of the camera shots in this DVD, but I guess he wasn't bothered by it. After watching this DVD, I plan to buy some more DVDs by U2. U2 Rocks!
B00005JLXE|5.0|Smith, Miller, Kirby, Lee, Everett, Bendis, Romita, Quesada, Mack. This flick didn't miss a trick. Impressive!
630025111X|5.0|The previous reviews couldn't have said it better. I will add that this movie has the best bronco bustin' ride ever in the movies. I saw the Tom Selleck version. Not good enough. It's like trying to remake Gone With The Wind.
B00005JLXE|4.0|Daredevil turned out to be a fun DVD with plenty of punch. The director gives us the right stylish mix of old and new Devil. Affleck is near perfect. Colin Farrell is just plain evil. Jen Garner is too damn cute!! There's plenty of heart and humor and action. The guy who wrote this obviously loved the comic. A labor of love and it shows.
B00008CLOA|4.0|Considered one of the finest albums ever released, DSOTM is like a journey.  From start to finish, you cannot help but be pulled in by this splendid album. Often referred to as a trance, where each song flows into the next.<br />Understandably, it has been digitally remastered for its 30th anniversary.  It sounds even better than before, and even if you have the original CD, the remastered DSOTM deserves a place in your collection.<br />It's a pleasure to own. Many people are only familiar with the track MONEY, but the album offers so much more.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|Inman's odyssey, his epic journey to return to his love waiting for him on Cold Mountain, forms the backbone of this story. Inman, played by Jude Law with admirable silence and restraint, is on a trek of the highest magnitude, walking across mountain after mountain, hiding from and sometimes fighting off the murderous Home Guard, and hiding from and sometimes fighting off equally miserable Union soldiers.<BR>Ada (Nicole Kidman), Inman's love, is the daughter of a Charleston preacher who moved to Cold Mt \\"for his health and on his doctor's advice,\\" right before the war began. He dies, leaving Adam raised to be a lady with no practical skills whatsoever, to fend for herself as the South loses and loses and loses. The farm is on the brink of being reclaimed by the surrounding woods when onto the property walks Ruby, Rene Zellweger. She lacks all the social graces that Ada possesses, but she's got what, today, we'd call \\"street cred\\": the girl knows how to slaughter a chicken, build a fence, till a field, whatever.<BR>The movie flips back and forth between Inman's Odyssean journey (during which he meets every kind of person, place, animal, and thing) toward home and Ada and Ruby's attempts to try to insure that there's such a thing as home for him to return to.<BR>It's the stuff of a good old-fashioned romantic epic.
B000006TRV|4.0|Well, firstly this album is no bomb. THe line above refers to a line in a song from the album called &quot;MOTHER&quot;, it's fantastic. While &quot;The Wall&quot; is not Pink Floyd's best album, it comes close.  It features Parts 1, 2 and 3 of &quot;Another brick in the Wall&quot; which is the only way to fully appreciate this song.  The radio edit version is good, but not as effective as the album version.<br />Other standout tracks include:<br />Comfortably Numb - This song sends shivers up my spine every single time I hear it.  If you enjoyed &quot;On the turning away&quot; (from their Momentary Lapse of Reason album) you will love this, they have a similar feel to them.<br />Run Like Hell - the introduction to this is simply brilliant.<br />Released in 1979, it was ahead of its time then. Re-released in 1999 as a new digital remaster, it should have stated on the sticker &quot;20 Year Anniversary&quot; but got a &quot;30 Year Anniversary&quot; sticker by mistake. A small detail.  The new digital remaster is worth owning.
B00009RAJH|4.0|I am a bit confused by the packaging for this collection. Unlike the other two remasters of Rumors and Tusk, FM is a single disc, with the bonus tracks tacked onto the end. If you look at the art on the disc itself, it says &quot;Disc One&quot; in bold letters. Was a second disc planned but scrapped?<br />But as far as the remasters go, the other two are better albums. Tusk has some odd audio glitches though.
B000002C1W|3.0|&quot;A momentary lapse of reason&quot; is considered one of Pink Floyd's poorest albums. Sure, Roger Walters was not on it, but it did generate two massive eighties singles:  &quot;Learning to Fly&quot; and &quot;On the Turning Away&quot;.  The latter being one of the finest ballads ever recorded.  Buy it for this song alone (and also to complete your Pink Floyd collection).
B000002KAT|4.0|All of Van's stuff from this era is brilliant. Astral Weeks is considered to be his masterpiece. It is very good. But, do we really want to hear Van break into one of ethereal chants for five minutes? The songs are great but they suffer from this kind of self indulgence that the other albums don't have. Van' really at his best when he's to the point. He can still manage the whole zen thing if he wants to, just tone it down. &quot;Warm love&quot; is perfect on this one.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|This film was truly wonderful.  It is entertaining, gripping, and an all around great story.  Definately a must own.  One of Crowe's finest performances, next to &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;.
6304240554|1.0|This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Followed closely behind by Night of the Living Dead. The zombies all look like crap. They grey skin makes a very unrealistic zombie. The boring movement of the zombies forces the viewer to fall asleep before they even get to the mall.<br />I think the characters overreact a little. Steven walks straight up to the zombie and gets ready to shoot. Turns out he waisted all his bullets shooting at nothing. That's right. NOTHING. Once he realizes this, he throws his hands in the air and runs off like a scared little girl running for him mommy. Why not just knock the zombie down? It's not like it's going to run at him.<br />\\"Martinez! We think what you're up to is more important than this zombie problem. Come out now, or we'll go in there and let one of our guys go crazy.\\" Martinez was evil. Worst than the plague of zombies.<br />Another thing. Where was the military in all this. This is something they would get involved with. I was happy to see the military was doing something to stop this zombie plague during the New Dawn. Not like Romero's movie. Why wasn't the military doing anything in Romero's movie? Because they can handle a bunch of slow, boring zombies. <br />People say that the new Dawn does not have an explanation for the zombies. Neither did this movie. In Night of the Living Dead they thought it was radiation from a sattelite that caused the mutations. They didn't confirm that. In Dawn of the Dead (1978) the people on the Emergency Broadcasting System said they were looking for the answer in the terms of a viral outbreak. That was not confirmed. That means Romero never told the answer. He just gave suggestions, just tlike the New Dawn. Dawn of the Dead (2004) suggested that a virus might be the reason. So people can't use that against the new Dawn.<br />The acting was just terrible. Roger was the idiot of the group. The guy everyone couldn't wait to get killed. Not only was he trying to get himself killed. He was trying to get Peter killed. What a f*****. Hey Rog. \\"There are only about ten zombies around you. Why not shoot them all in the head, then get in Peter's truck? Maybe you won't get bit.\\"<br />The biggest problem the movies has is the incredible amount of boredom it brings. George tried to make it scary. He did a poor job. George Romero isn't some great director who makes perfect movies. His movies sucked as much as House of the Dead did.<br />If Romero's fourth dead film is not as good as the remake of Dawn, then everyone can shut up about Romero being some kind of great director. Romero sucks.<br />George Romero comes out of no where with a 35mm camera, does zombies in his own style, and tells everyone that zombies must be done like this from now on. What a jerk. How dare he try to tell people what to do. I can do zombies the way I want to. Get out of my way George.<br />I don't know what Romero's trying to say with this movie, but it doesn't get through to the viewer who is already sleeping because of the boredom. What good would millions of dollars do a gang of bikers in the middle of a world where everyone is dead. They got the money, but now they have nothing to spend it on. Everyone's a zombie because the military didn't take action. Stupid military. Why didn't they do anything about this?<br />The news man with an eye-patch claims that zombies are motorized instinct. If that's true, then why do they use tools. Your instincts don't tell you to grab coins out of the fountain. They don't tell you to wave a hockey stick around. Why do they do it?<br />Now the biggest question of all. WHY ARE ZOMBIES AFRAID OF FIRE? ZOMBIES ARE AFRAIDE OF FIRE, BUT THEY ARN'T AFRAID OF A GUN POINTED STRAIGHT AT THEIR HEADS. ZOMBIES KNOW WHAT FIRE WILL DO TO THEM, BUT THEY DON\\"T KNOW WHAT A GUN WILL DO TO THEM. Sounds to me like Romero just needed to find an answer. Romero never told anyone why zombies are afraid of fire. Just like they never told why zombies don't eat dogs in the new Dawn.<br />People say that the fast-moving zombies arn't intimidating. Neither are the slow ones. Maybe the character in the movie was afraid of a zombie 100 feet away from him, but I wasn't scared at all. I was bored.<br />WHY DO ZOMBIES HAVE SUCH STRONG ARMS BUT SUCH WEAK LEGS. ROMERO HAS ESTABLISHED THE FACT THAT ZOMBIES CAN FORCE A PERSON TO A WALL. IS HE TRYING TO TELL US THAT SLOW MOVING ZOMBIES ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO FORCE SOMEONE ON THE GROUND? They can pin people to a wall, but they can't run. They say god doesn't give you two hands and they were right. Got the upper body strength, but no the lower boddy strength. That's hard to believe. <br />Anyone who tells you that this movie is better than the remake is full of sh**. The remake beats this movie in every way possible. What good is character developement when the idiots are the ones to die. The two make it out alive. Nice ending Romero. Dawn of the Dead (2004) had the best ending to a movie ever. They all died. That's great. Hardly anyone is brave enough to do that in a movie. It's more realistic than Romero's ending, where they flyi away and you don't know what happens to them.<br />I give this movie 0/5 stars 0/10 stars 0/15 stars 0/100 stars 1/1000 stars.<br />I sawn this movie March 14, 2004. 6 days before I saw the remake.
1558908420|3.0|Great little movie. Amazing cast, great performances. Nicely underplayed. Will be curiuos to see the directors cut with 11 extra minutes added.
B0001MDP3G|1.0|Cold Mountain never got off the ground. Its largest problem is the failure of any of its actors to emote, however, given the fact that all of their characters are nothing but ciphers, that's to be expected. <br />We never find out anything about their characters and as a result it's almost impossible to identify with any of them. The Renee character is so much of a country stereotype that we almost expect a banjo riff whenever she appears onscreen. The script also lacks three acts, as the movie is just a collection of short events. <br />None of these events are particularly exciting, and when coupled with the other writing problems, you end up with a film that has you checking your watch over and over again. <br />Now on to some good things: it's shot well. The photography is ok, but that's unfortunately all the positive things this film has going for it. There are far better romantic movies out there for you to see.
B000003TA4|1.0|Rock used to be great in the glory days from the 50s to the late 80s but then in the 90s nirvana and grunge crap came out that quickly died out and nucrap called numetal became popular which is just off beat guitar beats and guys screamin pain death death pain. Then in the late 90s punk was popular which gave us crap like blink 182 sum 41 good charlotte singin about how their life was so hard even tho they were rich and had everything they wanted. Then came rap rock which is a great idea but all of these guys rap about the same tired out things. this album destroyed rock and turned it into crap. If you want some good rock check out twisted sister motely crue the ramones Quiet riot Guns n roses AC/DC aerosmith or most other old bands. If you want some good rap get dr dre nwa ice cube boogie down productions wu tang clan notorious BIG 2pac big pun big daddy kane marley marl nas EPMD and the rest of the people who im too lazy to write in. PEACE
B00004SCX6|5.0|This album is just amazing it has amazing classics on here!<br />You listin to one song and you will luv it right away...<br />Go pick up a copy its worth it...
6304493681|4.0|Ghost in the Shell is by far the most intellectual anime I have seen so far. The story deals with a group of cyborgs running after a new sort of being, the Puppetmaster.<br />The animations are of course superb and even realistic. Try the Japanse voices, I heard the American and they are sometimes lacking in emotional depth and range. A little flat sometimes and that did not do good to this otherwise great movie.<br />If you like the Matrix, it looks a little like it. People who can hook up to the net etc.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|When we picked up \\"Under My Skin\\" it was one of several albums that went into the CD player in the car and when I did a milk run and was first listening to \\"Forgotten\\" I thought I was listening to the new Alanis Morissette album.  But after \\"Let Go\\" this second album by Avril Lavigne is certainly a step in a better, arguably more mature, direction.  On \\"Let Go\\" Lavigne worked with producer/songwriters Clif Magness and the Matrix, who polished up her melodic, edgy sound.  Her singles \\"Complicated\\" and \\"Sk8er Boi\\" both went top 10 and we figured we had Lavigne pegged as another female teenager singer-songwriter with pop sensibilities and shallow lyrics.<br /><br />But for \\"Under My Skin\\" there are two key changes.  The producer is now Don Gilmore (engineer on Pearl Jam's \\"Ten\\" and producer of several Linkin Park albums) and fellow Canadian Chantal Kreviazuk (who I recognize from \\"Time\\" on the \\"Uptown Girl\\" soundtrack) has a hand in writing half of the dozen tracks and does piano, keyboards, and string arrangements as well.  Do Gilmore and Kreviazuk get the credit for making \\"Under My Skin\\" a better album or does Lavigne actually get most of the credit?  Damned if I call tell, but somebody did some serious upgrading of the lyrics.<br /><br />Lavigne is writing songs about the down side of teenage boys, which is an expansive subject matter to contemplate.  After all, teenage boys are the modern equivalent of the giant dinosaurs of the past that needed a second brain at the other end to help them along.  When dealing with them the fundamental rule is to remember that whenever the other brain is engaged, do not believe anything that is being said.  As she points out in \\"Forgotten,\\" it is not like they are listening to you:<br /><br />Have you forgotten<br />Everything that I wanted<br />Do you forget it now<br />You never got It<br />Do you get it now<br /><br />If there is an obvious anthem on this album it would have to be \\"Don't Tell Me,\\" where she finds these boys wanting because of what they want and have the gall to expect:<br /><br />Guess it wasn't enough to take up some of my love<br />Guys are so hard to trust<br />Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl?<br />The one who gives it all away<br /><br />[Chorus:]<br />Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time?<br />Did you think that it was somethin I was gonna do and cry?<br />Don't try to tell me what to do,<br />Dont try to tell me what to say,<br />Your better off that way<br /><br />The consistent perspective in these songs is rather retrospective, as the charm and illusions on the teenage infatuation that passes for love is dispelled by the harsh realities of being a teenage girl.  It is not surprising then that \\"My Happy Ending\\" is about anything but:<br /><br />You were everything, everything that I wanted<br />We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it<br />And all the memories, so close to me, just fade away<br />All this time you were pretending<br />So much for my happy ending<br /><br />The theme is rather pessimistic from the start as we see in first track, \\"Take Me Away,\\" which establishes the idea that teenage love is pretty confusing:<br /><br />All the pain I thought I knew<br />All the thoughts lead back to you<br />Back to what was never said<br />Back and forth inside my head<br />I can't handle this confusion<br />I'm unable; come and take me away<br /><br />But since I keep thinking that this perspective smacks more of realism than pessimism, it seems to me that in the final analysis Lavigne is not only comforting young women but giving their male counterparts broad hints on what they are doing wrong.  Teenage boys can just listen to \\"He Wasn't\\" and then do the opposite:<br /><br />Sit on the bed alone, staring at the phone.<br />He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no.<br />He wouldn't even open up the door.<br />He never made me feel like I was special.<br />He isn't really what I'm looking for.<br /><br />This iswhen I start to bite my nails.<br />And clean my room when all else fails.<br />I think it's time for me to bail.<br />This point of view is getting stale.<br /><br />If teenage boys listen to the lyrics of \\"Under My Skin\\" then they should know how to do better.  But they better not try to fake it because Lavigne's target audience is going to be singing along with these songs and the words are going to get through.  I have been listening to this album repeatedly for about two weeks as you can tell even I started paying attention to the lyrics when I was singing along.  I have two teenage daughters and I certainly made sure that they got hooked on these songs as well.when I start to bite my nails.<br />And clean my room when all else fails.<br />I think it's time for me to bail.<br />This point of view is getting stale.<br /><br />If teenage boys listen to the lyrics of \\"Under My Skin\\" then they should know how to do better.

B0001IN0DA|4.0|I was there at MSG on that night, and let me tell you it was 100 times more loud than it's shown on the DVD. The crowd was into it all night long and my throat was killin me from screamin all night. But anyway here's a breakdown of the matches, rated 1/10<br />U.S. Title Match John Cena Vs. Big Show(c)                     ok match, good opener, Cena picks up Big Show twice. 6/10<br />Fatal 4 way for the World Tag Team Championship                 RVD & Booker T(c) Vs. Dudleyz Vs. Garrison Cade and Mark Jindrak Vs. La Resistance: another decent match but I thought it coulda been done better, even though it was fairly fast paced. 7/10<br />Chris Jericho Vs. Christian:                                   Very good athletic contest by both competitors and a suprise ending with Trish. 8/10<br />2 on 3 Handicap Tag Match Evolution Vs. Rock N Sock Connection: for someone with 4 years retirement and someone in Hollywood they both put on a good match, some funny bits are in there espically with Ric Flair and the People's Elbow :.) 8/10<br />Playboy Evening Gown Match Sable & Torrie Wilson Vs. Stacy  Keibler and Miss Jackie:This match was confusing cause it turns into a regular tag match instead of an evening gown match, but it was fun to watch. 5/10<br />WWE Cruiserweight Championship Open Chavo Guerrero(c) Vs. Jamie Noble Vs. Funaki Vs. Ultimo Dragon Vs. Rey Mysterio Vs. Nunzio Vs. Tajiri Vs. Shannon Moore Vs. Billy Kidman: I heard some people didn't really like this match. I really liked it, some great athleticism put on by everybody. 9/10<br />Goldberg Vs. Brock Lesnar: Oh don't make me laugh. This was THE worst match of the night, neither guy would even try to wrestle even when Stone Cold Steve Austin was the special guest ref. 0/10<br />Fatal Four Way For The WWE Tag Team Championship Scotty 2 Hotty & Rikishi(c) Vs. APA Vs. Basham Brothers Vs. World's Greatest Tag Team: Same comments for the other tag match. 6/10<br />Women's Championship <BR>Victoria(c) Vs. Molly Holly:pretty decent match by both divas. Suprise ending 5/10<br />WWE Championship<BR>Eddie Guerrero(c) Vs. Kurt Angle<BR>Great match from both men and pretty funny ending. 8/10<br />Undertaker Vs. Kane<BR>Great Entrance by the Deadman, does a lot of old school Undertaker moves, even though his attire is a criss-cross of Deadman/Biker 7/10<br />Triple-Threat World Title Match<BR>Shawn Michaels Vs. Chris Benoit Vs. Triple H(c)<BR>Best match of the night, Benoit gets put through a table, and a really great ending. 10/10<br />Overall, Wrestlemania was a pretty good show for everyone, now only if they do these kinds of matches more often.
B00005JM1F|2.0|Will Ferrell is one of those guys where you either really like him, or you don't.  I'm a huge fan of his but this movie was crap.  I'm entertained by juvenile gross-out comedies as much as the person but the story here is so familiar that I actually started to roll my eyes. Story is about Mitch Martin (Luke Wilson) who is in his early 30's and one night he catches his girlfriend Heidi (Juliette Lewis) having orgies. He moves out and lives in a house near the University and when his best friend Bernard (Vince Vaughn) finds out he convinces him to start a fraternity so that they can party every night and meet girls. They throw a wild party one night and Mitch's buddy Frank (Will Ferrell) gets wasted and goes streaking but is caught by his wife who throws him out of the house. Frank ends up living with Mitch and the three of them quickly become legends on campus.  It's been done do death.
B000003TA4|5.0|after listning to this album or any other nirvana album thats all i could say was wow.  i didnt really know where to put this review all there cds were excellent buy them all!  I dont understand how anybody could not like nirvana they have great lyrics and great preformences on the instruments.  If Curt had not have killed himself Nirvana would still be rocking and i would still be buying albums.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I recently baught the limited edition box set of Kill Bill volume 1 at the AnimeExpo.  Now to start off I must say Kill Bill volume 1 is a superb film with lots of flaws I might add.'<BR>I fell in love with this movie when I saw it in theater.  Right before the film came out I lisend to K-roq because they were interviewing Tarantino about Kill Bill and sadly he said that he had to censore or edit, I really donno which he did but he said he had to because the film would have got and NC-17 Which from Tom Greens standards is Porn with murder.  So Tarantino had to make the final battle with the crazy 88's in Black and White.  I didn't really bother me though, but it was disapointing to know that they had to cut some gore off too just for the sake of it.<br />When the guy at the booth told me that this is the Uncensored version of the film which is also (I forgot to mention) The limited edition box set only japan I had to buy cause Out of curiousity I wanted to see this film in it's original format.<br />And this is my true oppinion, not some joke just cause I've seen it with color since most of you KB fans probably saw it too with and this is trully what I though was better.....Black and White.  Why?  Because it just didn't feel right seeing this in color and it also seems more violent in B+W then color.  Although the Colored version is pretty violent I still Recomend the R rated version in America cause In bandw it's more articulate too(yea it is ok).<br />The only thing different between the US and Japanes is<BR>Japanes has the final battle in full color<BR>The japanes version has so more stuff that was cut out of the US version such as the part were Bride rips something out of a guys throat and in the Japanes version of the film Bride Cuts off Sophies other arm which wasn't shown in the US.<br />So if you really wanna see a good version see the R rated B+W version.  I say it was a little better then the Japanes version.  I personaly loved the US version of the film.<br />So if you haven't seen Kill Bill vol 1 get it in the US version...It's wayy better...<br />Later
B000003TA4|1.0|Grunge (thankfully) died along with Kurt Cobain a decade ago. Did the stamping-out of hair metal really work to the world's advantage? In my opinion, hell no. The surfacing of grunge gave hundreds of talentless, undeserving people careers just because of their \\"homeless chic\\" look and persona. Grunge is all about image and nothing more. Would you call a band grunge if its members never wore flannel and jeans regularly and didn't have choppy guitar riffs? No, you wouldn't. Now we're subjected to grunge rip-off bands that include the likes of Smile Empty Soul and Three Days Grace because of the sh*t Kurt made popular. At least hair metal bands gave us something to rock and shout about. Take, for instance, Twisted Sister. They were an innovative, talented group of crossdresser metal musicians who sang about how those of us who are considered \\"freaks\\" don't \\"have to take it anymore\\" (meaning being put down for our straying from what society considers \\"normal\\"). What did Kurt have to rock and shout about? Well, um, he had his own heroin addiction to whine about, and that was all. He also shouted about the Vanity Fair article that rightly portrayed him and his wife as the dope-shootin', child neglectin' unfit parents they are. By the way, I should also mention that Kurt made death threats  directed at the writer of said article because she let the world know the of Kurt and Courtney's neglect of their child. So much for Kurt's support for womens' rights! He repeately said he'd bash her head in. He was such a f*ck up!Nobody wants to hear about somebody else's problems you can't relate to when you could hear about ones that you actually can? No alienated teen out here can honestly relate to Kurt, because he was pushing 30 years old, and had more money than any of us will ever see in our lifetimes combined.
B00000JCB2|2.0|No term existed in the late 80s when I was in high school to properly describe M.L.: the guy was heavyset, dimwitted, mean-spirited, and plodding.  Today, though, it would be no problem to classify M.L. - he was a `mook'.  Inside our high school, poor M.L. was like a fish out of water.  As the teacher scribbled basic arithmetic equations on the blackboard, M.L. vacantly passed the time by sketching AC/DC symbols freehand on the cover of his notebook.  Not exactly an individual who strived for excellence. <br />In the classroom, that is.  In the high school parking lot, however, M.L. exhibited a commitment to excellence that even today remains the stuff of legends.  For four long years, he patrolled the perimeter of our schoolyard during the hour after school ended with a vengeance that bordered on the maniacal.  The original poster child for roid-rage, M.L.'s single-minded goal was to take out whatever frustrations had been visited upon him inside school that day on any poor sap who ventured outside the school and couldn't defend himself.  <br />Red-haired, freckle-faced, and unequivocally nerdy, `Rudy' couldn't have been an easier target.  It really was just a matter of time before M.L. made Rudy's acquaintance some day...<br />It was a beautiful spring afternoon and Rudy had just emerged triumphant from an Olympics of the Mind meeting at which he had starred as usual.  Riding the emotional high that can only come from having constructed a functional drawbridge in under five minutes from toothpicks, toilet paper, and twine, Rudy strode confidently into the parking lot to await the activity bus.  Before your emotional investment in him becomes too strong, however, I should warn you that Rudy was not entirely a sympathetic character.  For instance, in one fabled conversation with my friend Cynthia, Rudy explained in no uncertain terms that \\"women have no place in science\\".  The next day, Rudy returned to our lunch table and told Cynthia he regretted his comments fromthe previous day and wanted to amend them. \\"I'm sorry,\\" he began, \\"Women do have a place in science - as secretaries.\\"  Rudy guffawed heartily and strode away.  Bested by Rudy, Cynthia could do nothing but sit there rigidly teeming with rage.<br />So Rudy wasn't perfect.  But did he really deserve the abuse he was about to receive from M.L. in the parking lot on that fateful day?  I'll let you decide.<br />So, as I was saying, it was a lovely spring afternoon when Rudy parked himself on one of the garish stone benches positioned out front of our school and buried his nose in a book while awaiting the activity bus.  Little did he know that in the distance, a savage predator had already fixed his gaze upon him.  With a mixture of stealth and cunning normally observed only in the larger felids, M.L. approached his quarry from behind, emerging only once Rudy no longer had time to escape.  When he finally spotted M.L. just a few feet away, Rudy could do nothing but muster a weak smile and offer a meek, \\"Hi M.L..\\"<br />M.L. seemed to relish the look of fear he saw in Rudy's eyes and the quiver in his voice.  This was going to be almost too easy.  M.L. had to admit to himself that lately, the beatings he'd been dishing out had begun to bore him.  He needed to add some variety to his increasingly stale repertoire.  Just as he began to worry that he was losing his killer instinct, M.L. came up with what seemed to him a brilliant idea.  He said to himself, \\"Hey, instead of kicking his (behind) myself, why don't I make Rudy kick his own (behind)?  Man, would that be cool!\\"  <br />His sense of determination came rushing back to him and M.L. calmly went to work executing his dastardly deed.  M.L. engaged Rudy in small talk while simultaneously gently grasping Rudy's hand and molding it into a fist.  However, this was not the beginning of a homoerotic encounter.  As M.L. continued whispering sweet nothings, he repeatedly forced Rudy's fist to pummel his own face.  \\"Why are you hurting yourself\\", pleaded M.L., \\"Rudy, I'm your friend.  I want to help you.\\"  <br />But the only thing M.L. helped Rudy accomplish that day was a self-inflicted barrage of fists to the face.  <br />You may be wondering why I'm recounting this story in a review of Limp Bizkit's Significant Other.  The answer is that Limp Bizkit remind me a lot of M.L.  Plodding and dimwitted yet occasionally creative.  High school would have been a whole lot different for Mark and like-minded mooks if Limp Bizkit had existed back in the late 80s.  I can just imagine M.L. forcing Rudy to shout \\"Like a chump!\\" as fist met face, while M.L. provided the \\"Hey!\\"  Or M.L. cranking \\"Break Stuff\\" while breaking stuff.  Or even exclaiming, \\"It's all about the he said, she said BS\\" in response to assault allegations following his first \\"date\\".  Still, though several songs are not without merit, Significant Other's mean-spirited, lazy lyrics would have had to have eventually become tiresome to all but the most ardent mook.  <br />Rudy eventually became an aerospace engineer and has authored at least one book.  I have no idea what happened to M.L. though it's probably safe to say he's probably not a published author.  If anyone is still bobbing his head and smiling as Significant Other blasts from his headphones, though, it's probably M.L.
B0001Z2RUK|5.0|This is a great CD.  Keane have a unique sound; the combination of Tom Chaplin's soaring vocals with drums and piano really works.  Each song is different, some are upbeat and punchy, some slow and poignant.  It's not the sort of CD you buy where only a couple of songs are great and the rest are rubbish.  The talent is there throughout.  I look forward to their next release.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|None of those songs impressed me.... she is totally overrated.

B0000CEB4V|5.0|I took a chance on this and was pleasantly surprised. All star tributes can sometimes really fall flat, but this one is truly excellent.  Highlights include a truly inspired performance by Eric Clapton, Jeff Lynne (whom I'm usually lukewarm about) is good.  Gary Brooker and Joe Brown are wonderful as well.  Sam Brown steals this show with Horse to the Water.  The arrangments are great.  You can tell that the performers really wanted to nail it, so to speak.  The Shankar section is outstanding too.  My rule of thumb with a DVD is: Am I going to watch this repeatedly or just once or twice?  I find myself enjoying this concert again and again.  The one minus for me is Tom Petty.  I know he and George were friends, but....I've just never cared for him.  They should have invited Roger McGuinn instead. In spite of that I still think it's five stars.
B0001907DA|3.0|The Police Academy movies are, sometimes, the greatest films to put in your DVD player on a lazy Sunday afternoon for a \\"guilty pleasure-eighties flashback\\", escape from our millenium age high pressure current lifestyle.  The films from the eighties are fun, non-sensical, and simply comforting compared to today's highly tense, bad taste comedies.<br />The first Police Academy was the only one of the 7 which was rated R.  The rest were PG-13.  The first one was great because it was fresh and new.  I agree with many of the positive reviews Amazon's readers and reviewers said about it.  Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment, was improved and remained fresh because it added Tim Kazurinsky and Bobcat Goldthwait as new comic relief characters.  Police Academy 3: Back in Training, made these two new characters into police cadets.  Absolutely farcical, but yet, all the more reason that Police Acedemy maintained it's charm.<br />However, it was at Police Academy 4: Citizen's on Patrol, that it seemed that they were starting to \\"clutch at straws\\" to get a laugh. I'll admit, I enjoyed these \\"Police Academy\\" movies back in the eighties. Honestly, I really only have seen the first two in the theatre. The third one I saw on cable TV. Now that I've bought the box set on DVD, I can honestly say that it is at this 4th sequel of the \\"Police Academy\\" films, that they really should have stopped right here. A lot of the humor is predictable and (most annoyingly) often repeated. For example, Winslow (Larvell Jones), was doing his silly \\"karate man\\" humor excessively through many of the \\"Police Academy\\" films. If he only did this in one film, the humorous impact would have been cherished more. The first three \\"Police Academy\\" films are the best. Taking this predictable slapstick into four more follow-up films (with totally forgettable stories) was just a bit too much. On a positive note, \\"Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol\\" starred Corinne Bohrer* as Laura. What a gorgeous blonde babe she is! And also, I'll have to admit that on the documentaries of the making of the \\"Police Academy\\" films, Leslie Easterbrook is still quite an attractive looking woman. Marian Ramsey still looks good, too.  But, Bubba Smith?  Man, he's got a stupid looking haircut these days.  How embarrassing!<br />As a whole, the price for this complete 7 DVD box set is a bargain, even if you do have to end up with the last three excruciatingly dull films.  It's cheaper to buy this box set than it is to just buy the first 4 seperately.  I suspect that the last 3 Police Academy DVD's will be filling the shelves of used DVD outlets very quickly.  I'm glad I got rid of mine.is! And also, I'll have to admit that on the documentaries of the making of the \\"Police Academy\\" films, Leslie Easterbrook is still quite an attractive looking woman.

B00005JMJ4|2.0|The cinematography is excellent and, of course, Scarlett Johansson is wonderful to look at.  Even Bill Murray is pretty believable as a washed up actor.  But that's as much praise as I can muster.  If this movie had a script at all, the dialogue couldn't have been anything more than a weak suggestion. It  seemed as though Sophia Coppola just showed the actors her story board and told them to go improvise.  For all the Oscar buzz it received, &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is the 2003 version of a &quot;Blair Witch Project&quot; disappointment.
0790729628|1.0|Ridley Scott is more into visuals than dialog and plot. This much he has admitted in counless interviews.<br />By removing the narration, he leaves  the viewer with a lot of pretty pictures and not much else.<br />Even worse, we don't even have the option of buying the original (and superior) version.<br />Bad enough that this adaptation bears little to no resemblance the the Phillip K. Dick novel (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?) it proports to be based on. At least the original was an entertaining film by it's own rights. Now it lacks any narrative flow or explanation. What a waste.
B000001FN3|4.0|This album remains among the top five in my catalog (approx 500 rock, prog, jazz and classical albums). I bought the CD because the vinyl was completely worn out. Not knowing that the production had been altered, I was ill-prepared for change. Since then, I still long for raw power of the unaltered version. For that reason alone, I give this version four stars. The original deserves six.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT. ITS HAS ACTION ROMANCE AND HORROR. YOUVE NEVER SEEN ASHTON ACT LIKE THIS. THIS IS BY FAR HIS BEST ROLE AND MOVIE. ALOT OF PEOPLE WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE. MUCH BETTER THAN I EXPECTED IT 2 BE.
B00004RF83|2.0|Funny how both conservatives and liberals can cook up their own paranoid fantasies from the same sets of facts.  This Kennedy-era melodrama hearkens back to both the October 1962 missile crisis and the Nuclear Test Ban treaty of JFK's administration.  When some people on the Right claimed the country was being handed over to the Soviets, two liberal Washington reporters cranked out the novel &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; about a military coup to topple the government.  The movie is a faithful re-creation of the book and it's plain ridiculous.  Burt Lancaster plays an updated Air Force version of Douglas MacArthur whose nefarious scheme is foiled by a smug band of patriots led by Kirk Douglas.  Frederic March's President is so un-appealing you wish somebody would overthrow him, and poor Ava Gardner, 15 years on from being the most beautiful girl in Hollywood, looks like death warmed over.  Rod Serling's script is riddled with a pomposity he usually edited out of his &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; work.
0156027321|4.0|&quot;Life of Pi&quot; is one of those books that seemed to be everywhere, so when I had the opportunity to borrow it from my mother, I figured &quot;why not?&quot;  I'm glad I did.  This was an intriguing story about a boy confronting a life-and-death situation where survival will test his physical and spiritual self.  Pi Patel loves animals, and he loves religions (Hindu, Christianity, Islam), but he never expected to have both with him in a tiny boat floating his way across the Pacific Ocean.<br />When I was younger, one of my favorite books was Gary Paulson's &quot;Hatchet,&quot; a survival tale about a young boy in the Canadian wilderness, who lives through a plane crash only to find himself having to fend for himself.  Years later, I was elated to find something similar, though obviously on a higher reading level.  &quot;Life of Pi&quot; reminded me of that story, and provided gritty, true-to-life details about a harrowing journey through life, adolescence, and the largest body of water on Earth. <br />&quot;Life of Pi&quot; is an essential read for anyone that's looking to survive in life, whether you're in a boat, or just drifting through life, trying to stay afloat
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|THE MUSIC:<BR>Franz Ferdinand's catchy Take Me Out caught my attention recently.  I am not very interested in a good majority of artists who are out there today, so I was quite excited to be intrigued by a new group.  I read a lot of reviews most of which say they are the best band out there now, and being the complete believer I am, I purchased a copy, gave it a listen and was kind of surprised at what I discovered.<br />While Franz Ferdinand pens catchy tunes with cool lyrics, one thing completely stood out from over half of their songs:  Disco.  Almost every song had that 1-2, 1-2 disco beat.  This was emphasized even more by the bass player's monotony.  Does this mean I'm saying Franz Ferdinand plays disco music?  No.  Franz Ferdinand is better than disco, but be warned about the disco beats if you hate disco.  Does this mean I'm saying that Franz Ferdinand's music is terrible?  No.<br />This disc overall is very good.  I wouldn't go so far as to say they are the most brilliant band ever, but I would be lying if I said their music sucked.  It is the type of music that has the power to grow on you, which is something to be said in a society of instant gratification pop.  So even if you don't like their music the first time you hear it, chances are you will like it after a few whirls.  This is a testament from someone who gave it a few whirls.<br />THE DISC:<BR> 1.  jacqueline (3:49)<BR> 2.  tell her tonight (2:17)<BR> 3.  take me out (3:57)<BR> 4.  the dark of the matinee (4:04)<BR> 5.  auf achse (4:19)<BR> 6.  cheating on you (2:37)<BR> 7.  this fire (4:15)<BR> 8.  darts of pleasure (2:59)<BR> 9.  michael (3:22)<BR>10.  come on home (3:46)<BR>11.  40' (3:24)<br />The insert has a glossy cover with the band's logo on the front.  The logo is reversed on the back cover of the insert.  The lyrics are included.  There is one blurry photo of the band on the inside cover and a clear shot of each band member posing in the middle of the booklet.
0385121679|4.0|I liked this book a lot more the second time for some reason.   I enjoy everything Stephen King writes.   You really can't go wrong no matter which book you choose.  My all time favorites of his are The Stand, The Dead Zone, and all of his short story collections.   But I will eventually read everything he's ever written, still working on it!
B000001FSU|5.0|Following up the thrash masterpiece &quot;Among the Living&quot; would have proven to be difficult by most bands.  Anthrax in this case showed that they could produce an album equal to their greatest effort.  In some cases I prefer &quot;State of Euphoria&quot; over &quot;Among the Living&quot;.  The flow of the album appeals to me more I guess.  This album contains some of my favorite Anthrax songs ever.  &quot;Now it's Dark&quot;, &quot;Be All, End All&quot;, and &quot;Who Cares Wins&quot; stand out as pure thrashing mayhem.  Sadly this would prove to be the last of Anthrax's pure thrash metal albums.  The following &quot;Persistence of Time&quot;  was brooding and much darker, and also gave hints to the change in musical direction for the band.  If you want to expereince fun thrashing metal you can not go wrong with this album.
B0001L3LUE|4.0|A fascinating panorama of the twentieth century as revealed through the life of Robert McNamera.  Morris uses primary source materials like old photos and taped transcripts of McNamera, Le May, Johnson, Kennedy, and Roosevelt to perfection, and this gives the film considerable power.<br />The film maker goes far beyond his peers in his efforts to create authenticity (such as with the man-operated, life-size, air force sortie tracking board).  His stylistic touches are riveting- examples of this are the dominoes dropping across a map or egg cartons and skulls falling from atop a staircase.  My favorite shot was the beautiful, forelorn depiction of President Kennedy sitting patiently and poised to speak before a camera.  This is something that the viewer will never forget. The quote from Johnson saying &quot;we don't want more war and we don't want more appeasement&quot; will make you wince as it explains the complete absence of strategy in the Vietnam Conflict.  In fact, no documentary or motion picture that I've ever seen sums up as well the causations behind the Vietnam tragedy.<br />What keeps me from giving this five stars is due to some serious logical leaps being present in the narration such as McNamera being sure Fidel Castro posseses a rational mind.  Also, the guilt that is implied over the firebombing of Japan is tenuous without a discussion of the nature of Imperial Japan.  I don't personally buy that he and Le May could be considered war criminals in light of the Japanese aggressive attack against our nation.  The invader's record in China, particularly at Nanking, suggests clearly that we were fighting a just war.  Certainly any of those nations occupied by Japan would agree that there was a pressing need to hurl them from the lands they ravaged.
B000001FTD|5.0|&quot;AmongtheLiving&quot;sees Anthrax coming into their own, so to speak.  The album takes the spunky and fast east coast style of thrash metal, and hone it to prefection.  &quot;Among the Living&quot; fuses the fun good time spirit of the previous &quot;Spreading the Diease&quot; and brings it to maturity. Joey, Scott, Dan, Charlie and Frank work like a well oiled machine, and offers the listner a chance to experince pure thrashing fun.
B000002504|5.0|On the heels of the genius of &quot;Three Friends,&quot; GG created their most &quot;literate&quot; album  - with almost every song referencing a source of such repute  -  from the romance of Rabelais to the existentialism of Albert Camus to the incisive psychology of R.D. Laing, this body of material is on par with anything Yes, ELP, or Jethro Tull have ever produced. <BR>&quot;Octopus&quot; is GG at their zenith, eclipsing even &quot;In A Glass House&quot; and &quot;The Power And And The Glory&quot; due to the presence of Phil Shulman. <BR>Phil, who quit the band after &quot;Octopus&quot; was the vocal lead who also played trumpet and a spendorous sax. But since his two brothers Ray (bassist/violinst) and Derek (vocalist/saxophonist) added so much to the band's fundamental sonic ideology, Phil's absence was not accredited the importance it deserved. The timbral combinations and tonal blendings of &quot;Octopus&quot; are essential to the character of that album. Phil Shulman's presence rounded out the general presence of GG which could have rendered the entire band famous even today. <BR>So many forgotten bands . . .
B000002UJQ|5.0|I've been a fan of Radiohead ever since the single &quot;High and Dry&quot; hit the US. I have all of their albums, but I'd have to say &quot;OK Computer&quot; is their best work to be produced so far. It's unbelievable.<br />&quot;Airbag&quot; (5/5) It's almost as if Jesus Christ himself gave them the idea to make a brilliant opener, absolutely amazing<br />&quot;Paranoid Android&quot; (5/5) the &quot;Happiness is a Warm Gun&quot; of Radiohead songs, sort of like a 3 part song, but it's fantastic and a solid length (6:23)<br />&quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien&quot; (4/5) More of a trippy, U2 like song. The lyrics are great, and the guitar work from Ed and Jonny is great as well.<br />&quot;Exit Music (For A Film)&quot; (5/5) an EXTREMELY emotional piece. This is the saddest and most meaningful song on the record. It's also featured at the end credits of the movie &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;<br />&quot;Let Down&quot; (5/5) at first I wasn't really into this song. Then, I sat down and listened to the whole thing, and it was amazing. Thom's vocals building up along with the orchestration of the band make this song a truly special track.<br />&quot;Karma Police&quot; (5/5) is it any wonder why this is a radio hit? Most people who hate Radiohead will admit they love this song. Very cool ending with the guitar feedback loop<br />&quot;Fitter Happier&quot; (4/5) some people would say &quot;oh skip this one&quot; but I think there's immense tension and feeling in this song, even if it is a Mac computer voice reading off a list. The drunken piano playing in the background blend well with the somewhat positive like words that Thom's Mac was programmed to say, sort of like a satire. Although short (nearly almost 2 minutes) it makes the transition from &quot;Karma Police&quot; to &quot;Electioneering&quot; perfect<br />&quot;Electioneering&quot; (4/5) the dance/pop song. A Beatles type entrance, the banging cowbell, the crunching guitars, the tambourines, it all makes this track worth it.<br />&quot;Climbing Up the Walls&quot; (5/5) if OK Computer's job was to build you up to let you down, it would do it with ease. This album was perfectly placed, you'd go from tapping your feet from &quot;Electioneering&quot; to a dark, evil, creepy song. Brilliant, though, it slowly builds into a loud, frantic guitar frenzy ending with Thom's wailing scream.<br />&quot;No Surprises&quot; (5/5) if you're scared stiff from &quot;Climbing Up the Walls&quot;, consider &quot;No Surprises&quot; your bedtime nursery song. This song is so delicate and easy on the ears. It sounds happy, but if you pay attention to the way Thom sings and the words, it's actually a very sad song &quot;a heart that's full of waste and landfill, a job that slowly kills you, bruises that won't heal&quot; <br />&quot;Lucky&quot; (5/5) this is a key track from OK Computer. It's such a powerful, emotional song, the guitar work from Jonny is fabulous. One of my favorites, and excellent to see performed live. It's a pretty old song too, it's been kicking around the studio before the production of OK Computer, they finally produced, and thank God they did.<br />&quot;The Tourist&quot; (5/5) once again, it's almost as if Jesus gave them the notes to create this song. It's written by Jonny, the lead guitarist, multi-talented member of the band (although still sung by Thom) it's merely about annoying tourists who run around in a frenzy when visiting places, but the song is so beautiful and dreamy. At the end of this song, a bell goes of, sort of signaling the end of a classic masterpiece.<br />If you're really into this, check out some of the EP's they released, the b-sides are almost as good (and some are) as the album songs. Check out &quot;No Surprises/Running From Demons EP&quot; and &quot;Airbag/How Am I Driving?&quot; EP.
B0000033IR|5.0|This is a stunning album. Aretha has one of those voices that is able to make you feel whatever it is she is singing about. It's no wonder she is considered the Queen. She puts other divas to shame with her great voice. &quot;Natural Woman&quot; and &quot;Chain of Fools&quot; are probably my favorites, but every song is just so good on this album. I highly recommend it.
B00005JM02|5.0|Astonishing animation, standout performances, and a story with plenty of heart make this movie a winner in the best Disney tradition.<br />Traumatized by the loss of his wife and all but one of his children, an overanxious clownfish named Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) hovers obsessively over his son Nemo, stifling the boy's natural sense of adventure and curiosity and making his son miserable in the name of keeping him safe. When Nemo defies Marlin's wishes and is snatched by divers from before Marlin's eyes, the father sets out on an epic quest to find his son. Along the way, Marlin learns that sometimes the most loving thing a father can do is let go and let children take risks and have the adventures they long for. Nemo, for his part, learns that whatever his father's personal shortcomings, almost everything Marlin does is motivated by a fierce, devoted love for his son. This is the kind of movie that helps parents understand their kids and kids understand their parents--a family movie in the truest and best sense of the word.<br />Ellen DeGenneres is absolutely hilarious and winning as Dory, the ditzy but loveable blue tang fish (&quot;Yes, I'm a natural blue&quot;) who aids Marlin in his search despite being addled by short-term memory problems (&quot;It runs in my family . . . Where are they?&quot;). Brad Garrett (&quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;) and Willem Dafoe (&quot;Last Temptation of Christ&quot; and &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot;) turn in nice supporting performances as two members of a tankful of fish in which Nemo finds himself.<br />The computer-generated animation in this film is mesmerizing, but thankfully, unlike so many other movies these days, the visual effects never overwhelm the story or the characters. Instead, the animation supports the story, making Nemo and his friends more real and drawing us deeper into this incredible underwater world.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|The first time I heard this CD, it didn't blow me away like her other albums have. I kept listening to it over and over, and having allowed the album to sink in, it is now one of my favorite CDs. Sarah is one of my favorite singers, and she never disappoints. The CD only has 10 songs, but with Sarah, it's quality, not quantity, that matters. <br />1)Fallen- the first single. A great way to kick off this album. <BR>2)World on Fire- the lyrics are really good. They really make you think.<BR>3)Stupid- probably my favorite song on the album. It is impossible to not feel this song. The emotion Sarah conveys is too strong for that.<BR>4)Drifting- a really good song. The lyrics really hit home to me.<BR>5)Train Wreck- another terrific song. Who hasn't felt this way before?<BR>6)Push- one of my favorite songs on the album. It is just so good and real.<BR>7)Answer- another really good song. Sarah really sounds good here.<BR>8)Time- a terrific song. The lyrics are very strong and thought-provoking.<br />9)Perfect Girl- one of my favorites. This song is a perfect fit for Sarah's great voice.<BR>10)Dirty Little Secret- a great way to end the album. She leaves you wanting more, which is always a good thing.<br />This album is very good. Since it will undoubtedly be a while before Sarah's next album, it's a good thing she has given us an album as good as this to pacify her many fans. I think she should put out a greatest hits album. If anyone deserves it, it's her.
B0001CNRS4|2.0|First, the obvious question - why was I watching this? Well, when my younger sister was visiting me she rented it, and half from morbid curiosity/half from Jessica Alba's abs, I sat in. <br />This film chronicles the journey of Honey Daniels, from teaching dance at the unspecified \\"center\\" all the way to stardom as a choreographer of the stars. Along the way she's confronted briefly by a mother who knows \\"there's a whole beautiful world out there for her to see,\\" the slimy agent who wants to exploit her, the unsympathetic best friend, domestic violence, and well...now I'm boring myself.<br />I'll start with positives: It could have been worse. It at least looked like a real movie with real actors (for the most part). Alba looks pretty amazing, and for what dancing there is, it's well done.<br />The problems...well...let's be realistic. You kind of know what you're going to get with a movie like this, so it seems almost bully-ish to bring up things like plot and dialogue. Unfortunately, every character in this movie is a walking, breathing cliché, with as much depth as a puddle in your driveway. If that seems unkind, consider that I called them \\"walking and breathing.\\" That was benevolent. The other major problem is with the dance content. The only thing this movie really had going for it was Alba and her dancing. There isn't all that much of it. The story has her going off to be a choreographer, not a dancer, which takes her out of the action that most of this movie's potential audience wants to see. The only way for \\"Honey\\" to be successful would have been to cram it with Alba dancing. They didn't get that memo.<br />There are two reasons to see this film. 1) If you are an aspiring dancer and want some inspiration, and 2) if you really, really, really like Jessica Alba. I hope Alba gets past this one and makes some more films. She's much less annoying and much more talented than the current slew of canned actress/singers (Mandy Moore, Hillary Duff etc.). I did give it 2 stars, however, since it wasn't as bad as Glitter, the all-time low for movies of this type. If Glitter is 1-star, then this has to be at least 1 higher, so Jessica can thank Mariah for setting a standard so low that even this can surpass it.
B000002IST|4.0|...This is what it should have been credited to.  It's very Phil-heavy, but yet, all still seems to work out.  Of COURSE you can't compare it to Lamb or any of the other Gabriel inspired incarnations.  Why?  Because it's a different dynamic, and a different decade!  Phil and his backing band (OK, so it's not very flattering, but that's the impression I get) have put together a fine album here, which should stand on it's own merits, and not be compared to earlier, edgier Genesis.  Buy it if you like Phil.
B0001MDP3G|3.0|Many people seem to like this movie, and I am almost one of them. But there are things wrong with it that surface after as it digests, like a tasty meal tainted with ptomaine. A careful viewer may catch the signs of it as the film progresses, things that an optimistic moviegoer will just push aside to be swept up in the story. In the end these faults turn a respectable effort into a pile of cliches.<br />For its benefit, Nicole Kidman turns in a fine performance. She makes you wish the story was better. Renee Zellweger has gotten raves for her character, but I kept being reminded of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm all grown up. I like her and Jude Law but I wouldn't recommend this film in regard to them. Jude gets plenty of screentime but his character is so restrained, you hardly get to know him. And that brings me to the foul, tainted meat of this grandscale meal.<br />Cold Mountain is visciously anti-male. It makes a point of how stupid men are that they go to war and then conveniently side-steps the slavery issue or as the South saw it, a fight for independence. So is it saying that enslavement is better than fighting for freedom? In this way it actually reduces the women characters as incapable of seeing the Big Picture beyond home and hearth. The scene with Natalie Portman at first seems a refreshing avoidance of the politically correct &quot;Yankees/good guys, Rebs/bad guys&quot; of the last few decades, but when placed in the entire context of the movie becomes more of its latent theme: Men are Stupid, Bad, and Only Needed for Continuing the Species. So killing Yankees, since they are men, is no big deal. The tiresome and overworked Hollywood plot device of &quot;man sleep with woman, then he die&quot; (As I noted with &quot;The Missing&quot;) is embraced at the end to my total disappointment because it was so obvious it was going to happen. When Jude and Nicole decide to &quot;marry&quot;, I knew it was his last cigarette before the firing squad. All the hell and high water he'd gone through and any hope for an original ending was for nothing.<br />It would be interesting to watch the film over just for the body count, because it seems virtually ALL the men die! Just think about it and add up the bodies. By the end, it seems the only men left in the county are Renee's father and husband. And consider them: the father has bowed to his daughter's expectations of him, and the husband is docile to his wife. In the final scene he is even serving her at the table. As a last dig at the futility of masculinity, both the offsprings of Nicole and Renee favor the mother's appearance.<br />Certainly, Cold Mountain is a beautiful film to watch. But the ideas within its plot are disturbing. It is at its worst when the women, such as Renee, rant against the stupidity of men and war, as if the women, simply because they don't participate in any bayonet charges, are guiltless. Look into the history of the Civil War and you'll find the upper-class women urged their men to fight to protect their lavish antebellum lifestyle. It is at its best in brief scenes  such as the goat woman interlude. That was poignant and extraordinary. So I don't discount the movie entirely, but its inherent theme against men distracts me so much, I probably won't watch it again.
B000002UJQ|4.0|In releasing The Bends Radiohead was grappling with the potential stigma of one-hit wonderdom in the shape of comedy track from an otherwise pretty forgettable first album. They couldn't afford to indulge themselves and, through the bittersweet passage of The Bends they didn't. Thom Yorke revealed himself as an angry, ironic and thoughtful young chap with a ripper falsetto (launching in the process a most surprising, and awfully British, new genre of pop star, the Politically-Aware Ironic Former Chorister) and the two or three Radiohead guitar players demonstrated that they could come in on time after all, and could play some pretty meaty chops too. There are some great, great songs on the Bends; at times it rocks, it swaggers, and at others it sits quietly under a tree and sings about plastic surgery. Super.<br />OK Computer is sort of the same, but for my money, slightly more flaccid. The songs and the arrangements are certainly easy on the ear and the textures reward repeated listening. But it's a bit *too* ironic, a bit *too* serious, a bit *too* caught up with its own importance. Thom and co. (and many others besides) wouldn't agree with me, but in my view the Rock Album is not a particularly good vessel for relaying complex socio-political messages, as it tends to tip over into self parody rather too readily. OK Computer doesn't quite do that - but it sails a tack closer to the (dire) Straits of Self-Importance than it ought, and Kid A and that other one, when they get there, promptly capsize and sink without trace.<br />So in my assessment, while it's pretty and moody (the track lifted from Romeo &amp; Juliet is a cracker), it marks the point where Radiohead's famous disappearing act kicked off. Where did they go, you ask - well, when they look out these days, all they see is brown. Put it like that.<br />Olly Buxton
0844663662|5.0|I know this novel fairly well having read it several times (once aloud to my students).  It is about all time being always present if only we knew, or could realize it, or had a sense about time in the same way we have senses for light and sound.<br /><br />It is also about the Allied fire bombings of Dresden which killed something like 25,000 people.  (And so it goes.)  Kurt Vonnegut begins as though writing a memoir and advises us that \\"All of this happened, more or less...\\"  Of course it did not, and yet, as with all real fiction, it is psychologically true.  His protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, an unlikely hero, somewhat in the manner of unlikely heroes to come like Forest Gump and the hero of Jerzy Kosinski's Being There, transcends time and space as he bumbles along.  This is a comedie noire--a \\"black comedy\\"--not to be confused with \\"film noir,\\" a cinematic genre in which the bad guys may win or at least they are made sympathetic.  In comedie noire the events are horrific but the style is light-hearted.  What the genres have in common is a non-heroic protagonist.<br /><br />This is also a totally original work written in a most relaxing style that fuses the elements of science fiction with realism.  It is easy to read (which is one of the reasons it can be found on the high school curriculum in our public schools).  It is sharply satirical, lampooning not only our moral superiority, our egocentricity, but our limited understanding of time and space.  And of course it is an anti-war novel in the tradition of All Quiet on the Western Front and Johnny Got His Gun.<br /><br />Vonnegut's view of time in this novel is like the stratification of an upcropping of rock: time past and time present are there for us to see, but also there is time future.  Billy Pilgrim learns from the Tralfamadorians (who kidnapped him in 1967) that we are actually timeless beings who experience what we call the past, present and future again and again.  And so Billy goes back to the war and forward to his marriage, and to Tralfamadore again and again.  He learns that the Tralfamadorians see the stars not as bright spots of light but as \\"rarefied, luminous spaghetti\\" and human beings as \\"great millepedes with babies' legs at one end and old people's legs at the other.\\"  So time is not a river, nor is it a snake with its tail in its mouth.  It is omnipresent, yet some things occur before and some after, but always they occur again.<br /><br />And so it goes.<br /><br />What I admire most about this most admirable novel is how easily and naturally Vonnegut controls the narrative and how effortlessly seems its construction.  It is almost as if Vonnegut sat down one day and let his thoughts wander, and when he was through, here is this novel.<br /><br />In a sense, Vonnegut invented a new novelistic genre, combining fantasy with realism, touched by fictionalized memoir,  penned in a comedic mode as horror is overtaken by a kind of fatalistic yet humorous view of life.  Note here the appearance of Kilgore Trout, Vonnegut's alter-ego, the science fiction writer who is said to have invented Tralfamadore.<br /><br />Bottom line: read this without preconceptions and read it without regard to the usual constraints.  Just let it flow and accept it for what it is, a juxtaposition of several genres, a tale of fiction, that--as fiction should--transcends time and space.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"The World Is Not as We Think It Is\\"forward to his marriage, and to Tralfamadore again and again.

B00005MP58|5.0|I love this version of Pride &amp; Prejudice so much.  It's not only the best mini-series I've seen, but it also beats out most of my favorite movies.  The casting is wonderful, every character seems real and the actors play their parts very well.  From the smallest role to the biggest parts, all the characters are well-played.  Watching this, it seems Colin Firth IS Mr. Darcy.  Also, there is the famous wet shirt scene, and I must say, it does not disappoint.<br />The DVD itself is nothing special, though it is convenient.  The coloring is poor and for a Special Edition there are very few special features.  Still, everything on two discs makes it all worth it.  It takes up only the space a normal DVD would, unstead of a huge 6 tape set.  That is a huge bonus.  I just wish there was more to the DVD.  I would appreciate at least subtitles in French, but I guess what I have will do.  The featurette is nice, but there are no interviews with any of the actors.  I would like to see their opinion of the mini-series, the story and the book.  It's always nice to see how the actors feel about their work.  But I guess what's there is enough.  The film speaks for itself.<br />The only regret I have is that I saw this before I read the book.  I like imagining the scenery and characters for myself.  Although the movie provides more beautiful scenery, costumes and characters than I could imagine in my head, it still takes some of the fun out of it.
B00000DLUV|5.0|Since this is the first concert to be recorded in DVD format since the Bee Gees is born, so for sure it's very catchy. This is a CD with the concert recorded in only voice, but it will still be a great CD since it went plantium in serveral countries. 1997, the concert was held in Las Vegas, was also the year when Bee Gees was in the Songwriters' Hall of Fame, and Rock N' Roll Hall of Fame. It was a fantastic year for the Bee Gees.<BR>This concert contains great songs including Massachusetts, To Love Somebody, Closer than Closer (The only Maurice Gibb solo in the concert), One (Their best song ever), How Deep Is your love, and Alone. There are songs that have not bee performed by the Bee Gees themselves, which are Islands in the Stream, Heartbreaker, Guilty, Don't Throw It All Away (Recorded voice of Andy Gibb), and Immortallity featuring Celine Dion. I suggest the Celine Dion's fans to buy this one too, because Immortallity is very touching.<BR>Overall, this concert and the CD was super well done, since it was the third CD that was recorded lively. If you want the other two that were released earlier, they are Here At Last...Bee Gees Live, and Tales from the Brother Gibbs. Later on, Live By Request was released.<BR>Enjoy the trio!
0156027321|4.0|A young Indian boy, a Bengal tiger, a zebra, an orangutan, and a hyena- caught on a life-boat castaway amidst the vast Pacific for 227 days... <br />Now that is a sure-shot attention grabber précis for any story. While Yann Martell does not make Life of Pi any less an interesting read, there is more to the book. This book is a multifaceted comment on meaning of life and religious tolerance, as well as a cross-cultural reference to simplicity of life, while we ponder over the worldly mayhem of geographies and politics and what not.<br />Life of Pi is a story of a Indian boy from a small town in South of India, who takes to a cross-religion path of finding his faith in God. While the family is moving from India to Canada, the ship sinks and Pi Patel makes it to the lifeboat with the other characters of the story. Survives the 227 days in the pacific, and the story to be told is beyond what could possibly be covered in a paragraph.<br />Now living in Canada, Yann has spent considerable time in Iran, India, Costa Rica, Mexico, France and Turkey. This, undoubtedly, makes him a good hand at cross-cultural and cross-religious comments. He also has a very fluid way of telling a story, building the premise much before the point is made or an event happens, and in the process, literally not letting the reader go through any shocks whatsoever. While some have commented that the book is predictable, I think Yann has consciously made an effort at making it such a read -through this fluid way of story-telling that he has.<br />Quite well-researched, this book also beautifully morphs references in zoology, religions, and simple matters of life into the simple answer of \\"it is what you take it to be...\\". While talking about the ending would be wicked here, you would surely and perhaps subtly wonder, \\"what actually happened?\\". And that's what makes Life of Pi a book that might stay with you slightly longer than the few hours you would spend reading it.<br />Fully recommended, and something you would surely not regret picking up.
B00008EY65|5.0|Hellboy is one of the best action movies ever made. Hellboy contains lots of laughs and edge-of-your seat action. The effects are flawless. Ron Perlman carries the movie with his unusual and wonderful character.<br />Hellboy is a cat-loving son of Satan who is tough as hell but also tender hearted. The romance story in the movie was such that even guys will like it. (honest!)<br />Good versus evil is always a powerful theme when executed well. The story that even a demon can choose redemption lends an almost-new level to the genre, except that Spawn and Blade have already explored that idea.<br />Hellboy is a super hero for the ages. I do believe this will be an enduring classic.
0618526412|5.0|I can't believe this book was originally published so many years ago. As an avid reader for more than 55 years (I am 61 yrs old), it staggers my mind that I overlooked this &quot;way back when&quot;.  It is such an easy read ---- nostalgic &amp; real.  Please read it!
0156014041|5.0|'The Little Prince' is a wonderful story, written by Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry (1900-1944), a French writer who also worked to fight the Germans during World War II.  The publication story of 'The Little Prince' is an adventure in-and-of itself, as it happened at the height of the war, and just a year prior to Saint-Exup&eacute;ry disappearance over the Mediterranean while flying a mission with his French air squadron.  Saint-Exup&eacute;ry wrote several books, and illustrated them himself, but 'The Little Prince', about the visitor from outer space not so different from us, but perplexed by our ways, and homesick for his home, touches people to this day in profound ways, making this classic an enduring one.<br />Translated into Latin, this enigmatic classic becomes even more mysterious, yet (for those who know Latin) still a touching and moving story.  Books such as 'The Little Prince' translated into Latin make wonderful tools for learning the language.  The book here is translated by Richard Howard, a Pulitzer-Prize winning author, who has more than 150 translation titles to his name.  Saint-Exup&eacute;ry's original artwork is incorporated here, in the proper placement according to the French original.  They are in full colour throughout the book.<br />The language here is basic -- Saint-Exup&eacute;ry wrote 'The Little Prince' both as a children's book and an adult's book, hence the vocabulary and basic writing, in any language, is fairly simple, another way in which the Latin translation, kept to an easy construction by Howard, helps in the learning of the foreign language.<br />A great book, one to let out of the box.
B0001MDP3G|1.0|This DVD has one of the worst transfers I have ever seen. A &quot;transfer&quot; is how the picture looks from film to DVD. There are tons of problems with the look of the film, with compression artifacts and such. It looks as bad as a streaming hi-bitrate movie, and while those look OK, it doesnt look well on a DVD. Not at all. Definitely not recommended.
B000002H6C|4.0|This is a great album and is, for some reason, heavily criticised by many metal fans. Perhaps because its release came after 2 blockbuster albums, this one appeared to be substandard. Alright, its no Master of Puppets or Ride the Lightning, but it ain't bad just the same. I one thing I don't like about this album is the sound quality. It is a step down from its predecessors, with the guitars lacking the same punch, and the drums sound quite poor, especially the snare. Apart from this the album is quite well structured with some great metal moments.<br />'Blackened' opens the proceedings in style - excellent guitar harmonics in the introduction lead to strong, fast riffing. I really feel that the sound of the drums degrades the quality of this song significantly, and it could have been a hell of a lot better with drums more like Master, or Ride. A pretty good solo with a great mid section speed up.<br />'...And Justice for all'-  I loved this very long track the first few times I listened... unfortunately it got old pretty fast. Its a personal thing, because I just dont find the subject matter (lawyers/judges/justice in the courts etc) that interesting. A great solo is in there but the whole track is a little repetitive and the trademark Metallica tempo change only seems to deflate the track's momentum. Overall I found the title track disappointing.<br />'Eye of the beholder' - A tight metal track, the meaning of which I am yet to ascertain. Good, but nothing special.<br />'One' - A famous song, and the first of its type to really do well in the charts, and come attached with an MTV music video. To many true hard core metal heads this was the beginning of the end in terms of Metallica's heavy realeases. A good ballad, with an effective change in tone near the end leading to a blistering guitar solo. The energy in the latter part of the song is quite strong, with vivid war imagery created via strong lyrics.<br />'The shortest straw' - Terrific intro, a solid part thrash part heavy metal track.<br />'Harvester of sorrow' - A plodding track, with heavy, power riffing underlying the slow delivery of the lyrics by Hetfield. Quite a downbeat song, with a very negative feel to it. Well executed by the boys<br />'the frayed ends of sanity' - It is from this point I feel the album really picks up. This is an awesome track, one of those that you want to play really loudly in the car to let everyone hear it. It rocks with fast tempo throughout, with brilliant lyrics. The backing vocals are particular effective in this track. A terrific solo and pounding ending makes it one of my all time favourite Metallica tracks. VERY underrated.<br />'To live is to die' - A great instrumental, however an underlying theme/feel of morbidity and sorrow is detected. I often wonder if this track expresses the band's sorrow on the death of Lance Burton, as it does contain a brief verse of poetry written by the former basist. Stong emotions are conveyed in this song with little lyrics. Relatively complex guitar work a great fade in/fade out. <br />'Dyers eve' - Still dont quite understand the title, but probably the one pure thrash song on the album. Blistering speed, with a rapid fire guitar solo. James really screams the lyrics into the mike with passion on this one. Abrupt ending... don't blink or you'll miss it.<br />Overall a very good album, just not as good as their earlier stuff. It probably is one of the deeper albums they have realised in that each track can be analysed to find the true meaning hidden away somewhere in there, and there is a definate feel of emotional pain/suffering/sadness in all of the songs. Not a headbangers essential, but good to listen to just the same.
B00028HBKM|4.0|The Passion of the Christ is a beautiful movie. This film contains a certain perpetual power that will continue to move all who see it for days, months, even years afterwards. Filming the movie entirely in the ancient languages of Aramaic and Latin gives the Passion almost complete authenticity. THe filmgoer is simply there. The acting is wonderful. The Italian actress Rosalinda Celentano as Satan is terrifying yet strangely compelling. She steals the show, along with the disciple Peter.<br />Mel Gibson's \\"Passion\\" has caused much discussion and controversy. This is the way it should be, for a questioning mind gives one the potential to make one's faith stronger than ever. If, after questioning, one's faith does not hold up, it was never true faith to begin with.<br />This is the crux of the movie. In one scene, the Roman governor Pontius Pilate bitterly asks his wife Claudia the same question he had asked Jesus: \\"What is truth?\\" Of course this is a rhetorical question, having no easy answers, and meant to provoke thought and discussion rather than a solution. Watching Jeh-su-ah be scourged endlessly by Roman soldiers who are physically quivering with sadistic desire makes viewers think why? Why did this all happen? And so the question What is truth? leads to the question: What is faith?<br />The brief scene at the end of the movie eloquently sums up both the film and the last question.

B00005O3VC|5.0|Monty Python and the Quest for the Holy Grail is, by far, my favorite movie -and I'm sure it always will be! Being a truly hilariously-random film, this DVD does an awesome job of showcasing this fact to the highest extent. The killer white &quot;rrrrabit&quot; will live on in my heart forever, and I will always be knowledgeable that African swallows are non-migratory. What other movie has a group of knights requesting shrubberies -from King Arthur, no less- to create a 'two-level effect with a path through the middle'? Only Monty Python and the Holy Grail. <BR>The movie might sound strange as I mention these things out of context, but I assure you it is much stranger when Monty Python says it! <BR>So, to conclude this review, I definitely give &quot;Monty Python and the Quest for the Holy Grail&quot; DVD a 5 star rating, as I know it will entertain millions for years to come. Enjoy!
0316168815|2.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend who thought it was a great work and who had even waited in a long line to have it signed by the author. I eagerly began to read the book and although the beginning seemed like it would lead me to an emotional journey, I was thoroughly disappointed. In fact, I had to force myself to finish it. I collect books, but once I finished this one, I gave it to Goodwill. If I could have gotten my money back, I would have demanded it.  First of all, the author missed a great opportunity to delve into the emotional chaos that anyone would naturally suffer after learning that their daughter/sister/friend was murdered by an unknown assailant. This book is so superficial when describing emotions that the reader forgets the reason for the emotions in the first place (i.e., the murder of a loved one). I didn't care about any of the characters at any point in time throughout this book, including the protagonist.  You'd think that after being murdered so brutally, the protagonist would display anger, resentment, hate, sadness, etc.  But not under Sebold's direction. There was no depth to any of the characters in this book. For example, when the father learns that his youngest daughter broke into the house of the man suspected of murdering his other daughter and almost gets caught, the father's reaction was ridiculously non-chalant. And the ending! It was as though the author got tired of even her own story and decided to finish it quickly with the first idea that came to mind.  She should have thought the ending through a little longer. Don't waste your time or money with this &quot;novel.&quot;
B000002H33|5.0|MOP is one of those albums that grew on me over time. When I first heard it I actually wasn't too impressed (!), but after a few listens it finally sunk in how incredible this album is. In my opinion it is Metallica's finest, with every track completely unique and original in itself, and due to the fantastic variety of the tracks it does not fall in the all too common trap of many metal albums whose songs simply run into each other because of their similarity. The order of the tracks is also perfect, with the whole rhythm of the album flowing nicely. The album is a masterpiece and presents the full potential of creative heavy metal music, played with intelligence and extraordinary skill.<br />'Battery' kicks the album off, with a nice classical guitar intro lulling you into a false sense of security before the metal begins. A fast track, a true thrash classic, it sets the scene for the rest of the album with terrific vocals, an excellent solo and roaring drums and bass. Very well suited for the album's 1st track.<br />'Master of Puppets' is an absolutely awesome track. A concert favourite, and whilst the live versions pack a punch with concert adreline and improvisations, there is still nothing quite like this original version. An 8 and a half minute epic, its one of those tracks that you can still enjoy even if the true meaning of the lyrics are uncertain. I've heard various intepretations, including that it is about a drug addiction, but going over the lyrics I can't be sure that this analysis is correct. Nevertheless the lyrics still have potency, as does the killer riff. Almost half way through the song the speed slows down dramatically  and for about a minute a melodic bridge takes over with skillful guitar harmonics and a well structured, and brief James Hetfield guitar solo. Speed once again takes control very quickly and the brutal pace leads into an excellent and complex solo from Hammett. The track is brilliant in its innovation and tempo changes, is veryaddictive and provides the backbone for the entire album.<br />'The thing that should not be' is a good track to have coming in at number 3, with a significant slow down in tempo after the first 2 blistering entries. This song has been criticised for being too slow and plodding to fit in with the rest of the album, but I find it once again very creative and allows you to interpret it in a number of ways. Excellent imagery is created with the heaving riffing shadowing each of Hetfields haunting lines. A short but sweet guitar solo is accompanied by a very impressive fade out that reinforces the haunting nature of the track . This one is underrated.<br />'Welcome Home (Sanitarium)' offers an intriguing story from the point of view of a mental patient in a sanitarium. Not sure what Hetfield was on whilst writing this entire album but his ability to use lyrics to create vivid imagery in the mind of the listening, against a backdrop of metal and in such a limited amount of time is truly ingenious. This track proves no exception and the listener is placed directly in the shoes of someone locked away, and mentally torchered by his captives. Slow intro and mid section with a sudden speed up about 3/4 of the way through, leading to a good but relatively simple guitar solo. A nice ending with thumping pace throughout.<br />'Disposal heros' presents a large increase in pace and intensity from the prior 2 tracks and is probably the albums heaviest song. A dominant war theme underlies graphic lyrics depicting death, violence and the horror associated with war. This song walks a fine line between an anti war sentiment and almost glamourising the brutatlity, however the strength of the lyrics lead me to believe the former. It rocks along, is quite long (8 and a half minutes) but does not feel it because it is so unrelenting in force. An awesome, skilful guitar solo from Hammett is the song's peak, and whilst the drumming of Lars is excellent throughout the entire album, it is particularly extraordinary in this track and is a dominant force emphasining Hetfields vocals. Heavy duty, complex riffing creates a 'wall of sound' in this song, and is probably the loudest track. A brutal piece of metal.<br />'Leper Messiah', while not being a bad song, is totally outdone by the other tracks. On any other album it would probably be a major song, as it flows along nicely with interesting lyrics and a strong beat. It differs from the rest as the pace remains medium throughout, and the riffing is quite sparse and simplistic. A moderate solo, but the weakest track on the album.<br />'Orion' is a sublime instrumental, with a stunning fade in followed by very heavy riffing. The song is broken down in 3 parts. The track steamrolls along until about half way, with another startling change of pace. The mid section is an excellent, ballad like waltz, with terrific lead and rhythm guitars. An emotional theme seems to underlie this slow section, and presents the only 'nice' part of the album, yet still is quite powerful in its subtlety. Perhaps the unique thing in this track is the main solo is performed by Hetfield, not Hammett. Hetfield has taken on the solos in other tracks (noteably 'Nothing else matters'), and they are very impressive as they are in stark contrast to Kirk Hammetts work. They convey a real emotion to them, and he does not atttempt to use blistering pace. Soon after the speed picks up once again for an effective fade out finish.<br />'Damage, Inc' reinstates the thrash status of the album with blistering pace, and excellent lyrics. The solo is terrific with powerful riffing throughout. A great track to finish on.<br />Overall this album goes down as a metal classic, and should be in the collection of any rock fan.
B0000CDL93|4.0|Oliver Stone's Director's Cut DVD has an extra seventeen minutes of footage added.  This adds to the general suspense of the movie.  JFK starts off very slow, like a History Channel documentary, and you think &quot;Bo-ring!&quot;  But suddenly, in the whirlwind of dizzying camera shots and angles, you realize you are witnessing dark and distorted history being unearthed.  By then you are so deep in, it is impossible to get out.<br />Kevin Costner is brilliant as New Orleans D.A. William Garrison, the man who brought the only public trial to this date on the JFK assassination.  A string of brilliant and well-known actors complement the film.  Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Sissy Spacek, John Candy, Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, and Tommy Lee Jones give the movie so much credibility because their performances are simply so believable, and way out of the usual roles they play.  In fact, this whole film represents a role the U.S. player that is far, far out of the role we usually play.<br />The score by John Williams alternately scares the beejesus out of you, or galvanizes you to action.

B00005JMJ4|1.0|Love how those who like this movie resort to personal attacks and the belittling of detractors as proof of their superiority. &quot;You just don't get it... what would you think of Fellini films - obviously you wouldn't be deep enough to understand... oh, you only like things with explosions and bullets flying&quot;. Sound familiar. It should since that's most of what this site's reviews amount to. The most basic form of argumenative failure is ad hominem attack. Oh well, my disappointment with 90% of mankind goes on.<br />Actually folks I do get it. In fact I love thinking films and don't need extreme plot twists to keep me engaged. However, those who claim this is a wonderful character analysis are way off. I can't imagine weaker characters than these 2. Take Murray's washed up actor. He treats his wife with absolutely zero respect and cheats on her throughout the movie in reality. No he never physically does anything, but his attitude is pitiful, selfish and lacks depth. Her character is a total snore. She is a self-pitying early 20s nobody who has nothing to offer (no interests, no direction, no insights). <br />The worst part is that Coppola renders a wondrous and interesting society in a flat, 2-dimensional and dismissive manner. Are the Japanese portrayed in a realistic fashion at all? Coppola resorts to banal stereotypes of psychophantic, bowing no-ones, submissive women eager to please any man of power and faceless shills. She truly shows a total misunderstanding of modern Japan and its cultural shifts reverting back to her own preconceptions that are woefully off-target. Nice work.

6302054982|1.0|It's not often that I walk out on a movie.  This one, however, which I saw when it was first released, nearly threw me out of the theater.  After watching the movie for about twenty minutes I kind of suspected that I had seen the whole thing.  After forty minutes, I reailzed that I was caught in a loop of banality and so left the theater, along with at least one other viewer.  If Scorcese succeeded in doing anything with this movie, it was to show the sadness, banality and near pathetic quality of life of those the movie portrays.  In fact, if I knew this was the purpose of the movie, I'd certainly rate it higher.  As it is, if crazed &quot;soccer moms&quot; and lunatic &quot;sports dads,&quot; those who are truly in need of some redeeming value in their lives all had guns, you'd have &quot;GoodFellas: The Suburban Story.&quot; I'm wondering if Scorcese might have loosely based this movie on the equally painfully uninteresting book, &quot;Confederacy of Dunces.&quot;  Of course, the movie did allow Joe Pesci to perform some wonderful comic routines concerning, of all things, the theme of pinky rings.
B00008CLOA|5.0|dude, you're not even talking about the album you are suppossed to review in the &quot;rate this album&quot; section.  I don't care if you don't like DSOTM, just tell us why. stop saying &quot;oh don't listen to pink floyd listen to these bands that only i like because they're, like cool because there not mainstream.&quot;  give us info on why you feel it is bad album.  personally i love it. for its time and even now, it stands out for its originality, darker themes, exploration of human emotion and visualization.  everything about it was an ORIGINAL WORK OF ART.
0316548189|5.0|You should read, at least, a book or two about biographies of such noble people as Nelson Mandela, whose lives have been a blessing to the world. This was a great inspirational book and helped me to realize how simple and small things in life could bring so much joy into one's life. Far too often, I personally take simple pleasures of life for granted. The freedom is not free and the book cites how the freedom is brought at the expense of sacrifices of our fathers. The book is very well written and what impresses me is Nelson Mandela's mastery of English language.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I haven't read the real story of Peter Pan(the original book by J.M. Barrie), but since I was little Peter Pan has given to my life the spirit to believe in fairy tales and to imagine and think that this world is an awesom place to live and create stuff you can't ever find in this world like flying, pirates, mermaids, etc. The first movie that I saw of Peter Pan was the Disney Classic, the second one was the musical and the third one is Peter Pan(2003). In this movie you can find a more deep Peter Pan. He gets more deep with Wendy, because he kind of falls in love with her, you can also see his leadership with the Lost Boys and the connection he has with the mermaids. Also how the island of Never Land works with or with out Peter and according to he's fellings. In conclution I think thismovie is great and no matter how old you get you will always love Peter Pan.
B00005TT77|4.0|In looking over the reviews for this album, I noticed that many of the reviews focus on the quality of the Beatles covers presented therein.  This seems to me an errant methodology regardless of how one rates the covers.<br />&quot;I Am Sam&quot; is not a movie about the Beatles, it is a movie that's primary focus is on whether a mentally impaired man is able to raise his daughter.  It is a movie filled with a range of emotions.  I have seen the movie and listened to the soundtrack on cd on several occasions.  Each time the music greatly enhanced my experience of the narrative  of &quot;I Am Sam.&quot; <br />The soundtrack  for &quot;I Am Sam,&quot; in my opinion should be judged by how the songs fit into the movie  and not by how the songs compare to the Beatles orginal renderings.  Therein lies the risk in using covers of songs in movies rather than original works or at least the original renderings of established recordings.  Especially in doing covers of such acessible artists as the Beatles (in this case) or Elvis Presley (Honeymoon in Vegas).<br />I think however that the choice to use Beatles Songs as the soundtrack of I Am Sam was to borrower from the film's protagonist: &quot;An Excellent Choice&quot;.  The Beatles in many ways are a road map for the main character.  He is able to relate the history of the band to most every aspect of his life.  It feels very natural and real to have the songs of the Beatles perform as a raod map of sorts for the film.<br />I found the selection of the songs and their placing in the film to be extremely evocative.  The Wallflowers' rendition of &quot;I'm looking through you&quot; for example captures the idea that Lucy is noticing for the first time the limitations of her father's intellect and ability to deal with the outside world.<br />Both Rufus Wainwright in &quot;Across the Universe&quot; and Eddie Vedder with &quot;You've got to hide your love away&quot; convey the brooding emotions of a family in turmoil.  <br />Tojudge the  quality of the music in &quot;I Am Sam&quot; simply by the measure of the Beatles covers would be very similar to judging Sam's ability to effectively father Lucy by the measure of his I.Q.  I believe the film clearly shows that either of these judgements would be a grave mistake.
B00008CLOA|5.0|hey &quot;music fan from silence&quot;---this is a review of Dark Side of the Moon, not a plug for all the bands that no one listens to but you.  I don't think quiet sun compares to floyd; i've actually heard them.  <BR>DSOTM is filled with creativity and lyrics that explore the human condition, they inivite you to go further.

0156027321|4.0|...and makes reading this worthwhile.  I got pulled into reading this book because a member of our book club just had to discuss it with someone.  Then the rest of our book club read it too and we had a great discussion..... the ending especially needs to be discussed, because you just don't see it coming.<br />The story line is odd, which is not bad, but unusual.  Young Pi (short for Patel) grew up alongside wild animals as his father was a zoo-keeper in India.  The first part of the book gives you a lot of detail about animals (zoology) and their natural characteristics and instincts, setting you up for the main part of the story.  You may be tempted to skim through this part, but you may miss out on some humor about Pi, his curiosity, beliefs, and the kind of young and likeable person he is.  You will find yourself chuckling out loud at times at some of his thoughts, and marvel at how he embraces religion and faith, whether it be through Hinduism, Christianity or Islam, makes no difference to him, he believes in God Almighty.<br />Pi is 16 yrs of age when he and his family set sail for Canada to begin a new life, taking along a few animals from his fathers zoo. Trouble at sea takes the lives of all on board but Pi and 4 animals, one a 460 pound Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.  After the demise of 3 animals, it is Pi and Richard Parker who must survive aboard a 26 foot raft for 227 days at sea.  This is the main part of the book, and it will amaze you at what man or animal can do to survive.<br />Yann Martel is a gifted storyteller.  His humor, sensitivity and originality shows through each chapter of this unusual book.  A great book club selection.

B00004XMTH|5.0|I love ALW musicals of that includes JCS and many more. My favortie action/fantasy film is Lord Of The Rings, my favortie comedy would go to 13 Going On 30, my favortie romance is Alex & Emma, and my favortie horror-musical is Little Shop Of Horrors. But, my favortie musical would have to be \\"CATS.\\" Here is the story of how I came to love it: We got this tape in '98 and for 4 yrs. I let it pass me by. It was sometime after my 13th birthday (oh...I'm 14 now!) and I found this sudden urge to watch it. I was a little scared of Macavity, I mean who isn't? But after watching it a few times, I became use to him and fell in love with the musical. Now today, me and my twin watch it all the time. My favortie characters are listed below and the reasons why.<BR>FAVORTIE CHARACTERS<BR>TOMS<BR>_____<BR>1. Rum Tum Tugger- Uh, hello? He's H-O-T, and I love his H-I-P_'-S.! <BR>2. Mungojerrie- Hard to tell why I love this character, is it the way he jolts his tongue out? Or the way he smiles? Or maybe it's the fact that he is brave? Wait, it's all of that! I think it's sweet when he looks at Munkustrap after getting knocked down and then he turns to Macavity and hisses! A[...] loves Munku. Speaking of which...<BR>3. Munkustrap- He is another hot tom! I think him, Mungo & RTT are the hottest. Not to mention, I love the way he sings!<BR>4. Pouncival- He is so cute! Adorable! And so precious!<BR>5. Alonzo- He is Munkustrap's best friend, I think they might be brothers...Anyhoo, he probably has broken the flirting record, but who cares? I love this tom!<BR>QUEENS<BR>______<BR>1. Demeter- She is everyone's favortie! Of that includes mine, she is so sexy!<BR>2. Jemima- The prettiest kitten out of the tribe, and by- God the sweetest! <BR>3. Rumpleteazer- Brother of Mungo, and so pretty. She has this cute little giggle..which is fun to hear in the video!<BR>4. Electra- THE CUTEST KITTEN IN THE WHOLE TRIBE!!!!!<BR>5. Victoria- She's the lucky one...Did you see who her mate was during TJB?<BR>Well, this sums up my review! I love this musical! I LOVE the characters! And I ADORE the music in it! See this movie, you won't be sorry.<BR>P.S I hate Cassandra!!!

B000001OAA|4.0|The fall of grunge was a difficult period for popular music to face. No sweat for Garbage, who confronted the industry head-on with this, their alt-pop/rock debut, in 1995. We hadn't heard much of this genre after the Golden Age of Grunge struck, and when this genre struck back, it was a hell of a ride. While not altogether separated from grunge stylings, Garbage was infinitely more universal and definitely more accessible than most of the grunge acts of their time. <br />The album opens with the punky, spiteful \\"Supervixen\\" -- a grand first impression of catty frontwoman Shirley Manson, who was all fluoresecent red hair and skin-tight leather. The song's herky-jerky, stop-go style is immediately engaging, and the ripping guitar riffs recall peak-era 80s new wave. Manson shows a more introspective lyrical and vocal style on the second track, \\"Queer,\\" and even concots an immortal anthem while begging for antidepressants on \\"Only Happy When It Rains.\\" She emulates pre-\\"Eat to the Beat\\" Debbie Harry on the metallic \\"Not My Idea\\" and mimics the wailing pensiveness of the Cranberries Dolores O'Riordan [now Burton] on \\"Fix Me Now\\" while still sounding like herself: a gothic, artsy chick. She even performs a self-exorcism in the rueful, brilliant \\"Stupid Girl.\\" <br />Garbage truly covers all the bases here, and their to-and-fro musical style doesn't sound dated, even today, 9 years later. They still carry the same spark and playful attitude they did years ago, and cross the line of rock to pop so often and so smoothly (and so much better than the crossover bands of today) that it's almost dizzying. Always familiar, always sarcastic, and always effective, Garbage will prove to be one of the greatest rock and roll bands of all time.
B000002HMH|4.0|Load, id haft to say this album is a lot different than there previous albums. But hey they been out for a few years. James just happened to lose a little bit of the music. And for the people who dont like it, take my advice listen to the album over and over and the great vocals and instruments will catch ya. I give it 4 stars because its not greatest album, but its got some good songs on it, so go out and buy it.
B0001Z363W|5.0|I think Zack is one of the best electric guitar players around space and time, among others like Yngwie and Farreri...If you listen to them playing acoustic guitar trying to sound fast and clean, they sound very flat and the tones are so bad (like if they were so shy of really sound), is like Paco de Lucia playing Aranjuez when is best is flamenco...Perhaps the gain in their electric make them sound better than they are...This is a beauty album but Zack should play what he domains, acoustic guitar deserves as much respect as electric even when is an arabian inheritance. If you add they drunk voice, the electric guitar interludes and the melancolic lyrics this is a beauty cd but not by the acoustic which is flat and shy. By the way, please do not try to classify this music as heavy or hard. The songs 9 and 13 remainds me why the 70s and 80s are classics.

B000092Q4U|5.0|This is an incredible album from LoG. This album sends you on a ride of rage against politics and human stupidity. Most tracks have a certain anti-political sentiment that is masterfully shown through the music. Will Adler is an incredible drummer that pounds the double-bass drum through most of the album. That's why this album was proclaimed by Revolver Magazine as the best metal release of 2003. Buy it and begin banging your head to new wave of American metal.
0920668372|5.0|As a mother of two teenaged sons who will be grown and gone in the twinkle of an eye, I have always loved this book.  It is not incestuous in the least and I worry about someone who thinks this way.  I don't understand how a mother who has given birth, held, cared for, raised, shared all the joys,  disappointments, and accomplishments of one's sons growing to adulthood can even see it in that way.  No matter how old or big my sons get, I will never lose the memory of them being my babies and how they were then.  Neither my husband nor I can read this book or a couple of our favorites we read to them as children without getting tears in our eyes.
B000002JSJ|4.0|yes, it is definatly a generic heavy rock album. lacking the complexities and diversity of zep's previous efforts. lacking the keyboards too. forgivable due to the sucky situation it was recorded. polar oppisite of In Through The Out Door, which is a synth-happy, diverse album. <BR>achille's last sand- geat. a classic. zeppelin's most metallic song. what's with all the hype about the drum's though? bonzo kicked major ass on In My Time of Dying (from Physical Grafiti).<BR>for your life- so so<BR>royal orleans- forgetable.<BR>nobody's faultbut mine-great. a clssic. plant saves the day with his harmonica! it's kind o a shame that many of zep's greatest tune's were rip offs of blues artists.<BR>candy store rock- has a cool sound, but the lyrics are lame<BR>hots on for nowhere- very catchy<BR>tea for one- OH THE AGONY! MAKE IT STOP! when i first heard this song i thought i was an aternate take of Since I've Been Loving You, which is an awesome song by the way. this song, on the other hand, is best defined by the lyrics, because the minutes feel like hours. you'll feel like you've been listening to a song for 9 hours, and it still hasn't gone anywhere yet. i thought it was a general rule for zeppelin to get rid of any song that sounded exactly like another.<br />like i said, this would've been any other hard rock band's crowning achievement. this album is great for what it is, but it does not match led zeppelin's classic 6 albums. when compared to zoso, this one is so so. when on it's own, it sits on a throne. <BR>this along with In Through The Out door, and Coda round out zeppelin's stinky albums.
076790592X|5.0|This book touches a lot of people in ways they wouldn't think possible. (After all, it's only 195 pages!) Everybody should read it. It can positively alter the way you think about life.<BR> Mitch Albom had always promised to keep in touch with his favorite college professor, Morris Schwartz, after college was over. Of course, he didn't. Some years later, he saw Morrie on Nightline with Ted Koppel, where Mitch found out that his favorite teacher had contracted the painful disease ALS (Lou Gehrig's Syndrome. His body, but not spirit was slowly withering away.<BR> Mitch gets in contact with Morrie and they start meeting on Tuesdays to talk about life, death and happiness. Mitch tries to gain Morrie's insight on numerous quagmires, not only for himself, but for his entire generation of thirty-somethings.<BR> Morrie has a great attitude about life, and yes, death. He doesn't strive to gain posessions that he doesn't need. Instead, he focuses on people he loves and the relationships he has.<BR> Morrie's goal with Mitch Albom was always to loosen him up, to make him cry before his life was over. He succeeds not only to get Mitch to cry by the end of the book.<BR> This is quite possibly one of the best books I've ever read. It is full of great mantras that you should always remember. Keep kleenex handy, even if you are a tough guy.
6305127689|5.0|This movie is a definate classic. The story line is interesting and not mindless like many of hollywoods other movies.

Be careful about chosing when to watch this though, you may have trouble focusing your brain on anything other than Tom Cruises amazing smile.
B000031XBQ|5.0|One of the joys of being into a group like ABBA is that every time you pick up one of their albums, you know that you'll be hearing a well polished piece of work. Not every single song may ring your bell, but it seems like there was always high quality work ethic put into each album.<br />This collection of ABBA's hits is one of their crowning glories that I think gets overlooked too often. The lyrics of hits like &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; and &quot;Thank You For The Music&quot; are translated beautifully into Spanish, retaining the original meaning of the song, and without awkward or incompetent rhymes. <br />One of my favorite tunes on this collection is &quot;Dame! Dame! Dame! (Amor Esta Noche),&quot; which we know as &quot;Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight).&quot; Out of all the sultry &amp; saucy ABBA tunes, I always thought this song drove home the love-hungry theme better than any other. This Spanish cover captures the same exact passionate feeling, nothing diluted here!<br />There was a follow up to this CD called &quot;Mas Oro,&quot; which was not bad at all, but paled in comparison to this collection. If you are even just a casual ABBA fan, &quot;Oro&quot; is worth going out of your way to buy.

B0000A98ZP|1.0|I first saw this movie at a cinema in Austin in March, 1985. Just a year out of high school, I thought this was a deep, moving motion picture with a quality cast that really showed the feelings of different groups of students in schools. I could relate to the characters.    Move forward more than 19 years. This movie has not aged well. I read on the IMDB that John Hughes wrote this script in two days. After watching this movie again, I find that very easy to believe. It is horrible! - and this coming from a man who loves all things 80's! Was Judd Nelson about 35 when he made that movie? He looks about 20 years older than Anthony Michael Hall. Unbelievable characters and dialogue. Then they tie it up nice and neat at the end - with 2 unlikely couples pairing off leading us to believe there's no social caste in high schools.    With the small cast and lack of location shots, I'm amazed that I've never read about some high school drama club doing a stage production of this disaster. In any case, I've got a Breakfast Club DVD I'll never watch again - I'll post it under \\"Used & New\\" above.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Kill Bill was indeed a daring movie and creative to the extreme, putting down the other movies released last year. This movie had a mix of everything everybody tends to love, even the unexpected -- and I mean that in a very good way.
B0001Z363W|5.0|I'm very excited about the others Black Label Society albums. Mr. Zakk Wylde is a very impressive guitarrist, you know, outstanding guitar riffs and melodic-shredding solos. But in this record Zakk show, again, his versatility like a musician. Is not a &quot;Heavy&quot; album but each song have is own spirit. Very emotional album, a must have!!
0060930187|1.0|Although this book had some clever imagery and imaginative descriptions, the plot was almost non-existent. There is not one actual event throughout the novel. I could not empathise with the main character, but it did give me some insight into the minds of depressed people, because her life seemed to be one long, torturous toil, even though she really seemed to have no obvious reason for complaint. Even though the focus of the novel never strays from the main character, by the end of the novel, I barely felt I knew her at all; her depression seemed to consume any other personal qualities she may originally have had. As a fanatical reader, I felt I had to read it because it is a classic, but after doing so, I think it would have been best avoided.
B0002858YS|5.0|The Killers debut album, Hot Fuss, is the hottest American record of the year so far. The Killers may be the best band from America right now. We have to have pride. We can no longer leave it up to the English for our musical palette because we have the Killers. They combine a love for British music, showmanship, and killer hooks. The Killers are Brandon Flowers (voice/keyboard), David Keuning (guitar), Mark Stermer (bass), and Ronnie Vannucci (drums). This bunch met in Las Vegas two years ago, after Brandon left his previous band. Last summer they are playing shows in England. Now they are a big demand in the UK. After shows at Coachella, CMJ, and Weenie Roast, people are wondering who these guys are. They are well dressed and the bass player looks like Jesus Christ. These guys are what the doctor ordered.<br />\\"Jenny&quot; and \\"Midnight Show\\" are songs that make up a murder trilogy. The Killers are the best band that recreates the feeling and emotion of New Wave, while saying something absolutely new. They have a knack for having the best anthems since U2. The song \\"All These Things That I've Done\\" has a gospel choir breakdown in the middle of the song. Brandon Flowers is an amazing songwriter and frontman. It's amazing to think that he is only 22 years old. The Killers make the sound of synthesizers something to look forward to. You hear the sound of keyboards on \\"Smile Like You Mean It\\" and you think could you ever dream of a band more perfect for KROQ modern rock playlists. \\"Andy You're A Star\\" is more like Suede. \\"Everything Will Be Alright\\" is more like early Bowie. This band has come from nowhere and delivered a great album. They will be what we are talking all year.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|Room on Fire does not sound exactly like Is This It, nor does sound it sound completely different, but what we have here is a much tighter, polished sounding recording from a band that has developed musically from their first record. Room on Fire has some amazing moments, and the whole album has a great flow with songs that keep up very nicely. Some really good points are Reptilia, Between Love and Hate, and The End Has No End. The Way It Is is sort of a week spot but it still keeps you on your feet. <BR>     The Strokes are the band that started the whole &quot;garage rock scene&quot; and in the past 3 years so many &quot;the&quot; bands came out with their own crap but no one was able to do it better than The Strokes. What's nice to see is that The Strokes influenced some great new bands that didn't just directly rip them off like Elementary Playground (on Purevolume) or Adam Green. <BR>       People need to realize that The Strokes are developing just as a band should. Their sound didn't change radically from their first album, but the album hardly sounds the same. It has a very different tone, much more serious and paranoid, and the band has created catchy new songs where it can clearly be seen that actual thought went into creating this music. That is much more than I can say about almost every other band out there.
0446678430|2.0|I read this one after reading Rich Dad Poor Dad - the first in the series. I can't say I learned anything new. The author's point of view is made clear enough by the first book, and as I put this one down I got the feeling it was time to move on to books by others, and broaden my perspective on the subject.
0783230079|5.0|This movie is definitely schmaltzy, of this there can be no question. However, as another reviewer so eloquently stated said, it works. After all, it's not so often that one feels quite so shamelessly manipulated by a movie yet remains wearing a smile to the end. <BR>   The four actors comprising the four &quot;limbo-ed&quot; souls are excellent in their own right, with Tom Sizemore being especially good in a comical role quite unlike his other star turns. Elizabeth Shue must be one of my favourite heroines (you could tell she had it even back in &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;), and it is downright unbelievable that she hasn't appeared in any major releases as of late. She is utterly winning in her appearance here. Still, even her performance is eclipsed by Robert Downey, Jr., whose ability to capture his fellow actors' personal mannerisms (or I should say their characters' mannerisms) is a lesson in the art of imitation/impersonation. The sheer talent of Mr. Downey is a joy to behold, and it is a tragedy for the acting community (and the audience) that such a phenomenal actor has been so shackled by drugs and forced to act in such dreck as &quot;Gothika&quot;. <BR>      &quot;Heart and Souls&quot; is a marvellous movie, well worth the 5 stars given. It reeled me in hook, line, and sinker.
B00003CXCT|5.0|When I bought my ticket, I saw the movie.  Even-steven. After I left the theater, I didn't owe George any more money, and he didn't owe me any creative control over future editions.  Period.  So many sad, sad people here seem to think that because they are fans of a movie, that it belongs to them.  It does not.  The price you pay for a rental, a ticket, or even a DVD box set entitles you to watch the entertainment product provided.  That's it.  You don't get a hotline to Lucas's den to give him tips about how to do his job.  Who here would presume to give him career advice anyway?  I think he's doing OK as is, just ask his accountant.  <br />Don't kid yourself.
1594200106|5.0|The first word that comes to mind is: incredible! The translation is flawless (you really would never know it was translated) and the story is wonderfully written and captivating from beginning to end. The character development is strong (John Irving would be proud) and the last 20% or so of the book just flys by... true literature. My eyes will be peeled for Zafon's next work.<br /><br />I've read one book every week for the past several years but this is the first book that has motivated me to respond with a review. It is also probably the first book that I will consider reading twice.<br /><br />If you like to \\"escape\\" into a novel then this one is hard to beat - I found it to be a wonderful diversion from the worries of everyday life.
0385510438|1.0|I kept waiting for this book to get going, but it never did.  After wading through much politically correct mumbo-jumbo of the main character, it became obvious that I was in the midst of reading one of the worst books ever written.  I had never written a review before, but this book was so bad, that I just had to go online and see if anyone else thought the same as me.  Don't waste your time!
B00000I41J|5.0|A great example of Cannonball Adderley's gift to the world - his unequaled sense of uncomplicated melody. No other saxophonist in modern jazz had such a love affair with what less sympathetic listeners might deem 'the cliche' - a notable phrase that might have been heard before in numerous lesser recordings, but that Cannonball used because he truly liked the way they sounded, not because he was running out of ideas. His solos on this album and many others are as pleasant to experience as any in jazz, and while at times he came across as a bit of a lightweight, there's always something serene and lovable about his choice of notes, often preferable to the sturm und drang of his contemporaries. This isn't really Cannonball's date, as Miles needed to fill out an album requirement for Blue Note and decided to give his friend a hand. Miles takes the first solos and dominates overall, yet it's also an equal meeting between the two. Great hard bop, with an excellent bonus cut, 'Alison's Uncle', sounding like a lost Charlie Parker track from 1953.
B00005JMUA|5.0|The whole Kill Bill movie is awesome, 1 and 2. What people don't seem to understand is that the movie wasnt just divided in two because of the length of the story, the more important reason is because Volume 1 was intended to be a tribute to the famous japanese samurai movies such as the Akira Kurosawa films, so it has more action, stranger soundtrack, the anime, the gushing blood, etc.<BR>Volume 2 is an homage to films of western culture, mainly spaghetti and American Westerns, like the Sergio Leone dollars trilogy and such. You can tell because of the desert and Mexico setting and the western soundtrack with songs by ennio morricone. Together, the 2 movies show how one common story can be told across the world, in the East and West.
B00024BHTC|5.0|I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS HEIDI MORON IS ALL OVER NIGHTWISH PAGES.<BR>BY THE WAY IF YOU LIKE SYMPONIC METAL, THIS ALBUM IS A MASTERPIECE
B0000009SG|5.0|\\"Your mind is totally controlled.  It has been stuffed into my mold, and you will do as you are told. Until the rights to you are sold.\\" Has there every been a better criticism of televison than \\"I am the Slime?\\"  Over-Night Sensation is the one album to have if you're not a total Zappa head.  It has some of his best known (and great) songs including the silly sexual send-ups \\"Dina Moe Hum\\" and \\"Dirty Love\\":  \\"Give me some dirty love, like some tacky little pamphlet in your Daddy's bottom drawer.\\"  I purchased ONS sometime in the last century when I was fifteen and I got in serious (...) with my Mom for cranking Dinah Moe Hum up in the house with my friends.  I don't think she thought it was very funny.<br />I hadn't heard this album in years and just gave a listen, damn if there isn't some fantastic fusion inflected rock to be found there-in. I'd forgotten how creative the music and arrangements are.  Great drumming by Ralph Humphries, the excellent keyboards of George Duke, Ruth Underwoods lightning marimba and violin courtesy of John Luc Ponty.  Not to mention the marvelous bass and horn players and some of Zappa's most smoking leads ever.  What a great tone he has on this album - excellent wah playing (waka jawaka).  I love his distorted leads on \\"Zomby Woof,\\" and of course \\"Moving to Montana,\\" a song about a gentleman dental floss farmer.  Its silly sure, buts its funny and has great instrumental bits and melody.  Humor and real instrumental muscle equals essential Zappa.<br />People have criticised this album for the silly sexual songs, so what, they're funny and freaking grooving.  Check out the funky backing track worthy of Sly or '70s period Miles behind the \\"busy\\" part of Dina Moe Hum. I recently saw George Clinton and the P-funk alstars and they quoted a lengthy bit of Zomby Woof! So \\"do as you are told\\" and buy  this album.<br /><br />\\"The poodle bites, the poodle chews it. Not a speck of cereal for my dog.\\"
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril's new cd is awesome!!! my best friend got it 4 me as a birthday gift amd i love it!!!! its sooooo much better then let go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! my favorite songs r &quot;take me away&quot; &quot;togeather&quot; &quot;slipped away&quot; &quot;He wasn't&quot; &quot;How does it feel&quot; &quot;happy ending&quot; and &quot;Nobody's home&quot; this music is the bomb!!! u have 2 buy this cd!!!!
B000089CJI|5.0|This power-pop cd is the most amazing I've heard.  Get it now.
B00008EY9G|3.0|The movie really did keep my interest.  It made you think and wonder who the killer is.  The only thing is, you really do have to pay attention.  If you aren't too bright you will get lost and the movie will be confusing!  I had to watch some of it over again, and ask questions about this movie on various message boards lol.  It gets very psychological! Other than that, it's  very interesting, it has suspense, mystery, and thrills, with a solid cast! Definitely a watch!
B00005B36H|5.0|Being a passionate music enthusiast with a wide variety of musical tastes, I've been exposed to a great many bands and albums over the years. From the emotional torment of Nine Inch Nails to the bizarre and unique sound of Comus, I've heard a lot of interesting things. But, when I purchased Tool's &quot;Lateralus&quot;, I was, quite frankly, blown away.<br />Tool's &quot;Lateralus&quot; is, without a doubt, one of the most amazing records I have ever had the pleasure to hear. The mind-exploring, emotionally-stirring lyrics, combined with Tool's unique and brilliant musical sound, make &quot;Lateralus&quot; an amazing work of musical art. Every song on this album never fails to impress and emotionally stimulate me every time I listen to them. The intense 22-second-long scream on &quot;The Grudge&quot;, the embracing passion of &quot;Parabola&quot;, Maynard's ferocious vocals on &quot;Ticks &amp; Leeches&quot;, the soothing serenity of &quot;Disposition&quot;, and the dark beauty of &quot;Reflection's&quot; ending climax never fail to get my blood pumping and my heart beating. All of these specified moments on &quot;Lateralus&quot; are great, but these are just the mere tips of the iceberg of the album's overall greatness. <br />Perhaps it's just me and the emotional connection I maintain with this album, but never-the-less, it cannot be denied that Tool did an incredibly exceptional job with &quot;Lateralus&quot;, and that it is very, very unique - musically, as well as lyrically.<br />I strongly recommend this album for anyone that has a mind and emotions.
0393317552|5.0|He poses one hell of a question and he does a hell of a job answering it.  There are a thousand things this book can teach you.
0790731452|5.0|Neglected masterpiece, misunderstood and unappreciated by far too many. It is not perfect, perhaps could benefit from some extra production time, but the film's incredible inventiveness, brilliantly wacky humor, and fantastic sets more than compensate for its shortcomings. Great, brutal fun.
B00003CXCT|1.0|George Lucas is the worst director of all time. He's also pretty bad at scripting. But he got lucky a few years ago. And when he worked with others, and yielded to their expertise, greatness was acheived (look at TESB). Now he insists on doing everything his way, re-writing history for his own accord. All George has to do is realize his genius for writing, but not directing, or scripting. George, you could've been great.
B0001L3MI0|1.0|Possibly the most idiotic film of the past 30 years. The only redeeming moment is when Randy Quaid tells about being abducted by the aliens. But even there, following the pattern of absolute predictability, we have already guessed that he will not survive to the end of the film. After all, who is a better candidate to sacrifice himself, than some wretched drunk and misfit. Utterly dispensable.
0784011680|5.0|If you're anything like me, the almost semi-annual relapse and recovery of Robert Downey Jr. has been an interesting periodic feature of the morning news. After a while one begins to question why does Hollywood put up with him when there is no shortage of talented actors desperately trying to make it in Hollywood? Why would producers and studios, who are so financially dependent on their productions going off without a hitch, take yet another chance on Robert Downey, Jr? Then I saw Chaplin, and I understood.<br />The intensity and power of the Robert Downey's performance in this film is the stuff of Oscars and true movie legend! It's both a beautiful performance and a beautiful film!<br />Somehow Sir Richard Attenborough got out of Downey the kind of performance that can sustain a career, and a legend. But Sir Richard's mastery didn't stop there. He got spectacular performance out of everyone, including a young, pre-X-Files David Duchovny. (I know I misspelled that. But you know who I mean.)<br />In summation, Robert Downey's performance is every bit the equal of James Dean's in Giant, East of Eden or Rebel without a Cause, and maybe that's what we should keep in mind. For unlike Dean, another self-destructive personality, Robert Downey has not driven off the cliff yet, and hopefully he never will.
B000002UB6|5.0|This album has always seemed to get bad reviews.  The absence of George Martin as producer is often cited.  However, I couldn't help but enjoy every song for its uniqueness.  Perhaps this isn't the most original of all Beatles albums, but the group was under a huge amount of stress at the time.  For life-long fans like myself, it's an essential.  Many of the songs like &quot;Let It Be&quot; and &quot;I Me Mine&quot; indicate how the group felt at the time--the turmoil surrounding them.  I also enjoy the studio talk and cool cut and paste songs like &quot;Dig It&quot; and &quot;I've Got a Feeling.&quot;    &quot;Dig it, dig it, dig it...&quot;
B00008CLOA|5.0|1. Speak To Me/Breathe- It starts off with sound effects taken from later in the album along with three guys talking about how mad they are and laughing. Then there's a small build-up to 'Breathe'. It sounds very relaxing and smooth. The lyrics are nice to listen to as well.<br />2. On the Run- I'm not a big fan of techno, but if you're in to that then you might like this. To me it sounds alright, but not great.<br />3. Time/Breathe Reprise- 'Time' is my favourite song on this album. A terrific introduction followed by great lyrics sung very nicely with terrific guitar solos and background singers. <BR>The 'Breathe Reprise' fits in well right after this song. <br />4. The Great Gig in The Sky- This is my favourite instrumental of all time. The piano sounds very nice and the vocals are very powerful and well-done. I thought the guy explaining why he wasn't afraid of dying fit in alright. Overall, this sounds really brilliant. <br />5. Money- Probably the most poplular song from the album, 'Money' includes an excellent riff and the saxophone solo is just plain cool. Really a great pop/rock song. &quot;Heheh, I was in the right.&quot;<br />6. Us and Them- After the rocking 'Money', they tone things down for 'Us and Them', an excellent song with great echoing lyrics. I really liked the saxophone and piano in this one. Very powerful song.<br />7. Any Colour You Like- One of the most brilliant instrumentals ever. I think this is the most psychadelic song off the album. The organ and guitar sound incredible. Awesome song.<br />8. Brain Damage- I like this song mostly because of its lyrics and the background singers. They both are brilliant. <br />9. Eclipse- Just another great song from the album. It is the shortest one, though. <br />&quot;There's no dark side of the moon really- as a matter of fact it's all dark...&quot;
B000002MUN|5.0|I was introduced to Tom Petty through this cd and I quickly fell in love with his music.  The critics need to listen to this one again.  It's got a little bit of everything.  &quot;Honey Bee&quot; has great guitar music. &quot;Good to Be King&quot; hits me with its darkness and stunning lyrics...&quot;I'll be king when dogs get wings...excuse me if I...&quot;  This cd isn't just rock, country, or alt.  Whenever I listen to it I'm reminded of the time I used to fight with my siblings for it.  It's definitely one of my favorite albums--from any artist.
B000002U8G|5.0|1. One of These Days- This instrumental reminds of a battle (no battle in particular). I liked the bass and the drums especially. I watched the Floyd do it on 'Live At Pompeii' and it was terrific, just like the recording.<br />2. Pillow of Winds- This one is not my most favourite off the album, it sounds pretty nice, though. If you like that really folky sort of thing you might like this one.<br />3. Fearless- I just really like this song. The lyrics and the way they sing them is nice. <br />4. San Tropez- I like a lot of blues and jazz. This sounds like it and it's really smooth. I really like the piano in this.<br />5. Seamus- I wondered why they put this song on there, but it's alright, just a little weird. I liked the dog in the background, he/she sounded nice.<br />6. Echoes- This song is, without a doubt, the greatest song ever composed. Everything about it is terrific. I watched this on 'Live at Pompeii' too and it was great. I really liked that one part where they all jammed before heading into that mysterious bit (listen to it and you'll know what I'm talking about).
B0002234LS|3.0|If you've ever read any of my other reviews, you know that I love Johnny Depp.  I've seen most of his work and he does not fail to deliver in this movie.  He's cute as a button and slings off one liners that are signature Depp.  However, the person I was watching the film with and I figured out the plot not even halfway through the movie.  I wouldn't have called it &quot;gory&quot; as one reviewer did.  I actually hid my eyes more in &quot;Stir of Echoes&quot; then in this film.  It did keep my attention, but only because the actors did a spledid job with the material they were given.  I would recommend this movie for any Depp fan because you do get a classic, quirky character.  It's no Jack Sparrow, but it's obvious that Depp tried.  If you want a scary movie that keeps you guessing, go with the first movie from the director: &quot;Stir of Echoes&quot;.
B000024D4R|5.0|Hey you, 'pogo', haha charade you are!<br />1. Pigs on the Wing 1- I don't really understand the lyrics very well. It still sounds very nice, though. I like it a lot.<br />2. Dogs- A real epic. I like the lyrics and the guitar a lot. The way that it's sung sounds cool.<br />3. Pigs (Three Different Ones)- This song is just plain awesome. I really like the guitar at the end of the song. The lyrics are fun to sing along with.<br />4. Sheep- This is my favourite song off of the album.  The keyboard at the beginning sounds really groovy. The lyrics are again awesome. The best part is at the end after &quot;Get out of the road, if you want to grow old!&quot; The guitar is just awesome and fades out with the song terrifically.<br />5. Pigs on the Wing 2- This is like the first part, it just sounds really nice.
B00006F2TV|5.0|I have mostly been disappointed by \\"super hero\\" feature film attempts.  The first \\"Superman\\" movie was cool, as was the first \\"Batman\\" flick, but both still had problems.  As a Spiderman fan (okay, I guess I'm a bit biased), since a kid, I was wondering if they could do justice to this, probably the most truly interesting and unique superhero comic character ever created.  They did it!  And best, they did it right!  This is a great movie and works excellently on almost all levels.<br />I have never been so surprised and taken aback by such a well done movie since I saw The Matrix for the first time, and Fight Club. I haven't seen a Spiderman \\"comic book\\" for a decade or so, and though I couldn't help to hear some pretty positive feedback on this film, before I actually finally watched it (on cable), I wondered.  Would they really get Spiderman \\"right?\\"  Truly though, this exceeded all my expectations.<br />I have read other reviews which complain about too much obvious CGI and a \\"video game\\" feel overall to most of the action scenes but hey, I see nothing wrong with any of that.  First, what's wrong with video games anyway?  Some can be quite entertaining, and some can contain excellent special effects and storylines.  This has both, and second, no \\"controller\\" is needed.  Just sit back and relax and enjoy.  Anyway, how the heck DOES one translate a colorful costumed superhero swinging from skyscrapers and bridges and such, without almost \\"video-game\\" effects?  If anything, I was and am astounded at the effects, and how they translated ink and paper into 24 frames per second, and almost flawlessly.<br />Tobey Maguire is and was flawless casting.  He brings the down to earth, nerdish-ness of Peter Parker, transformed in heroic times into a web slinging crime fighter, to the big screen perfectly.  Kirsten Dunst, is okay, but imo, played just a bit too sexy and very UN-girl next door from the character I remember from long ago, but I guess we're in new times and a new millenium.  It was also nice to see Cliff Robertson, semi-blacklisted for a time in Hollyweird, get a nice part here, that of Peter's uncle Ben, Parker's \\"father\\" he never had.<br />There are two distinct stories here, one of Peter Parker's life, and then the special effects blockbuster scenes.  Both mix well throughout, and I never got bored at all, even by the slower, quieter, dramatic scenes.  In fact, there's really not a dull moment here, and it's obvious equal attention was given to the non fx parts of the movie just as much as the eye-popping and exciting action parts.<br />Even non-fans of this general genre will find a LOT to love here.  If the thought that a movie called \\"Spiderman\\" based upon a comic book turns you off immediately to even giving this one viewing, you're really missing something special.  If you're expecting a heavy-handed, \\"dark\\" type of \\"Batman\\" experience here, you won't find it.  If you're expecting an over-the-top and almost self mocking comics/movie translation ala Superman, look elsewhere.<br />However, if you're looking for a great story, plot, acting, and amazing special effects, if you're looking for 2 hours of pure amazing entertainment, this film version of the AMAZING Spiderman is hard to beat.  A five star triumph, and my thanks to those who made this, and made it so right.w millenium.

0060955775|5.0|Is always unfair, to describe the plot of a book, beacause if someone wants to read it, well they don't want to know the spice of the writing, Veronikas decides to die, it's a book that will leave you with a teaching lesson, on how we don't live our life at the maximun, and we takes some things for granted. This masterpiece will make you think, a nice a book from a fine Brazilian writer.  A most have to any lover of drama and eye opener plays.
B00005JLSE|2.0|Don't get me wrong.  I love this movie more than just about any other movie in existence.  The problem is that whenever you get a big-budget, Oscar-winning movie, the initial release on DVD is always going to have at least 2 discs and 2-3 hours of special features.  So naturally, I eagerly awaited the release, so I could bask in the sheer excessiveness of the entire product, but instead, I watched as the curtain rose to reveal a DVD that, from my perspective, can only boast of having a 3-minute-long musical number deleted from the theatrical cut of the film.  I was crestfallen, and proceeded to wait until they unveiled the real prize, the multi-disc extravaganza that I had expected from the start.  But still I wait, so I am forced to say that the DVD is only worth renting, but not worth the $20.00 that the distributors continue to ask for.  The movie is incredible from start to finish, but it's just not worth spending $20.00 on this, only to see Miramax release a 4-disc set the moment you take the plastic off the case.  I personally will wait until they release it in a DVD set that truly does this masterpiece justice.
0784010501|4.0|Madonna's controversive career and publicity mounted at a top point in early nineties following her video release of #1 single LIKE A PRAYER, her appearance in Warren Beaty's blockbuster DICK TRACY, the year 1990's sold-out BLONDE AMBITION world tour, and the subsequently unapologetic music video from self-title studio LP EROTICA. However, to date, no official video remastering has been worked on the VHS of BLONDE AMBITION tour. TRUTH OR DARE is the best recap of Madonna's best onstage performances, rehearsing, and periodic life spent offstage during the promotion of her multi-million dollars tour across Europe, American, and - Japan!<br /><br />This documentary captures all the tell-truth interviews and self-reflections of the superstar as much as the roles of the people and her family who were there with her touring at some point. There is a scene where she shrugged off Toronto's police warning of her lewd concert act and way passed the officials with her background singers Niki Haris and Donna DeLory. There are plenty of laughters, celebrations, and tears too. She also visited Antonio Banderas and the Spanish film giant Pedro Almod?var when the tour stopped by Madrid. As a matter of fan's interest, the behind-the-scene film also reveals the unusual bond and closeness between Madonna and her seven queer dancers who invented the \\"House Of Extravagenza\\" dance culture for her #1 world-frenzy hit VOGUE.<br /><br />I only hope there could be more recaps of her performaces in Japan especially, when her long blonde ponytail were once making a wave!<br /><br />TRUTH OR DARE is Madonna's best entertaining work to offer for those who appreciate her artistic musical expressions thoughout the eighties. You'll love this DVD, do not miss it.
B00002Z88D|5.0|No, I don't know much about heavy metal, or any genre for that matter.  I know only what I hear on the radio, which these days is pretty pathetic.  But I had to buy this album when I heard &quot;No Leaf Clover&quot; on the radio and I've become addicted.  I will agree with some of the criticisms of this album, but I have to disagree with those that think this is a distaster, far from it.  Metallica and Michael Kamen create a fabulous work, from the reimagining of &quot;Call of Ktulu&quot; (the orchestra turns up the volume on the guitar part that fades in and out of this song), to SFSO horns harmonizing with Metallica's guitars in &quot;The Master of Puppets&quot;, to the full accompaniment of the SFSO over the guitar melody in &quot;One&quot;.  There may be some truth to the idea that Metallica sold out with this album.  Since I've heard this album, I've bought &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; and &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, and I listen to them on a regular basis. This album does have its flaws, but they are few.  The only complaint I have about it is that I didn't go to see the concert.<br />Long live the memory of Michael Kamen and Cliff Burton.
0446605409|5.0|This is my first book by Nelson DeMille and what a pleasant surprise it was. This is one of the best examples of great mistery novels. It has everything: great suspense, good character development, main character NYC detective John Corey is very likable and could be easily identified with, a lot of humor, etc. It's also quite informative on the some subjects that are related to the plot. If anything, I was a little surprised to read some other reviews saying that the first part of the book was a little boring and the last two pages is where the most action takes place. I actually found first part to be the most suspenful and thought that whole sea adventures didn't need to be covered in so many pages. Still, great mistery novel that is highly recommended to all mistery fans. I am looking forward to other books by this writer.

0446530891|3.0|I really liked the novel until the final. It doesn't let you put the book down and, therefore, it's a good mistery thriller. Oh, if only the ending would make any sense. Unfortunately, there is no logic whatsoever in how everything is explained in the end. And just because the bad guy is crazy as the author implies it doesn't mean that his actions shouldn't have any reasonable explanations. Besides, I found main characters not to be really beleivable. Still, keeps you reading.
B00003CXTG|2.0|I must say that, when I saw this film. I was expecting a high intensity build towards the ultimate climax of the attack itself. Instead, we get the usual Hollywood love fest, Hollywood liberties on the truth (though I am not bothered by the liberties themselves, but sometimes the liberties are too ridiculous!) For example, some of the ships used in the movie to be hit by torpedoes are woefully modern, IE not of WWII time period. The Doolittle Raid, look at the aircraft carrier, it shows an angle that only modern nuclear ACC's have, back then the ACC's were long rectangler shaped vessels. <br />Lastly, I just found it boring and it was like the director was attempting to do a Titanic style story with fictional characters caught in a love triangle all the while the story builds towards the attack as a secondary mentioning. Just way too much Hollywood liberties taken against one of the darkest times for America, and I can't help but feel that the veterans, especially those who were there, should have been given something that respected them more. <br />I will say though, the attack itself is stunning, why I give it two stars... other than that this movie falls flat for me.
B0001MDP3G|4.0|\\"Cold Mountain\\" is exquisite, as defined as `of delicate artistry and composition\\" or as \\"of extreme beauty'. Its roots go back to the sweeping epics of long ago, such as \\"Dr. Zhivago\\" and \\"Gone With the Wind\\". Moviegoers addicted to fast food and instant gratification may find it slow and even tedious. More patient viewers, however, should be enthralled. In the end, \\"Cold Mountain\\" does not quite achieve the artistic heights its makers were aiming for, but its many moments of great beauty and emotion make it a worthwhile effort. It is one of 2003's best releases.<br />Unlike its epic predecessors, \\"Cold Mountain\\" does not take place in a great capitol like Atlanta or Moscow. It centers in a very small town in a sparsely populated region of North Carolina. It is a `forgotten' part of the American Civil War. Its protagonists, Ada Monroe [Nicole Kidman] and Inman [Jude Law], do not know each other well. Ada has recently moved to Cold Mountain from Charleston, SC with her preacher father. It may be love at first sight, but Ada and Inman barely have time to get to know each other before the war separates them. Inman goes off to fight, and, when Ada's father unexpectedly dies, she is left to tend their farm, a task which her classical education upbringing leaves her ill prepared for. A kind and knowing neighbor sends her a backwoods girl [Renee Zelllweger] to help out. As the war years drag on, Ada and Inman, caught up in worlds they do not understand, cling to each other as symbols of hope. Hardly knowing each other, each must fantasize about the other. Theirs is a love of the first magnitude.<br />The cast is brilliant, but Zellweger steals the show. It could be because she is the only major cast member who is actually from the American South. [But, then, Vivian Leigh was from England, and she stole the show in \\"Gone With the Wind\\".] I think it more likely that Ms. Zellweger is an extraordinary actress who can outdo other extraordinary actors like Ms. Kidman and Mr. Law.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Spears 4th studio album, \\"In The Zone\\", is actually her most listenable offering so far. Britney finally crosses the line of being a girl to a woman, as she ridiculously sang about in her last album. So what if it has taken Britney 3 albums to finally produce a solid one? According to Britney, this is her most impersonal album. You heard that right--impersonal. If you want to know what is in Britney's zone, the bulk of the album talks about Britney's sexual awakening. She has come to know about sex, she has done it, and now she sings about it.  Britney has enlisted the big guns to produce this album ditching Max Martin and his Swedish boys responsible for the army of undistinguishable artificial pop she delivered for the past 4 years.  With the likes of Cathy Dennis, responsible for Kylie Minogue's global smash \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\", techno-king Moby, R. Kelly, and pop-rock duo the Matrix, it is safe to assume that with them, Britney has finally found her musical identity. <br /> Though this is a hit-and-miss album, the hits in the album are more memorable than its misses. The opener \\"Me Against The Music\\", a duet with pop queen Madonna, sets the pace for a non-stop dancing trip. With a rumbling bass line, hypnotic rhythm, and throw-away lyrics, the pop royalties took this song to another level as they wildly sang the chorus without inhibition, which what makes the song infectious. Obvious 2nd single choice, \\"Toxic\\" is the best piece of Euro-pop I've heard in years. With a contagious Bollywood orchestral arrangement, set in a patch of thumping bass, matched with Spears' playful vocals, it was with no question the song became massive. \\"Showdown\\" and \\"Breathe On Me\\", displays Britney as a dance-diva in the making, and the Moby collaboration \\"Early Morning\\", is a worthy piece of experimental pop, as Britney lets loose and exerts her voice  lounge-style giving the song a more sexy and intimate feel.  As for the misses, we couldn't blame Britney for her limitedvocal range as exhibited in the emotional ballad \\"Everytime\\", a song about her break-up with former beau Justin Timberlake. Spears fails to deliver the grit and pain needed for the song. Spears couldn't also get rid of her tongue-in-cheek lyrics such as \\"Outrageous is my sex drive\\", and \\"I got the boom boom that you want\\". In the song \\"The Hook Up\\", Spears rides on the reggae wave that Sean Paul has started and ends up with disastrous results, and in the heavily synthesized \\"Brave New Girl\\", facets of Spear's old sound resurfaces. Britney goes for street-cred in the cuts \\"I Got That Boom Boom\\" and \\"Outrageous\\" with mixed results. If not for the senseless lyrics as described above, the cuts are actually hard and tight enough to be stuck in your head for quite some time. The masturbatory \\"Touch of My Hand\\", finds Spears singing about pleasing herself. The song is drenched in a Middle-eastern vibe laced with smoking string arrangements and quite possibly the raunchiest lyrics heard in a long time, \\"I love myself, it's not a sin, the more I come to understand the touch of my hand\\". <br />Though \\"Zone\\" is a solid dance effort, one could think that Spears should have written more personal song about what she is currently going through as a person amidst all of the hype surrounding her.  Undoubtedly, Spears has produced a party album that is of high standards. However , this offering lacks a more personal, and sincere touch. It was as if Britney hasn't let anyone in her real zone.
B000002UAF|5.0|The strong opening note of the CD album grabs the listener's attention-although it doesn't take much extra effort to KEEP the listener's attention as this CD is one of The Beatles' finest outputs of music. The first seven songs are from the movie (now on DVD) of the same name; the collection of songs and ballads on this album is striking and reflects the youthful excitement and optimistic energy of the early Beatles' work.<br />A Hard Day's Night is the first song and this is a phrase coined by Ringo as he reflected on a previous all-nighter pulled by the band when they were under great pressure to turn out some hits. He is known to have said that the foursome had worked through \\"a hard day's night;\\" and thus the main line of the title song (as well as the title itself) was born!<br />Of particular note is the moving ballad \\"If I Fell.\\" The ballad is beautiful and shows a man's (not just a woman's) vulnerability in a romantic relationship.<br />The sound quality is excellent and the cover pictures are photographic stills from the end of the movie of the same name.<br />This Beatles CD is indeed full of the \\"classic songs\\" another reviewer refers to and I highly recommend it as a must-have for any Beatles fan as well as lovers of this type of music. Moreover, this is an excellent starting point for those of us who are more accustomed to the \\"traditional\\" sound of the crooners or other music genres if these listeners want to get a first class introduction to early 1960s rock.
B000053VAF|1.0|The idea of skewering the Catholic Church is not new. Nor is it particularly \\"brave\\", since they're supposed to love their persecutors. I'm still waiting for the \\"brave\\" film that skewers, say, militant Islam. Yeah, you kind of lose your courage when you might actually get hurt.<br /><br />Anyway. The general hype looked promising. A film that pokes fun at Catholicism. I popped in the DVD and waited.<br />And waited.<br />And waited.<br /><br />Let's see: there were excrement demons, a black apostle, some homicidal angels ... but where was the satire?<br /><br />It's a shame. This film would have worked better as a comedy. That is, if the writer/director(s) had said, hey, let's make this  humorous. Throw in some jokes, some laughs. After all, they had Chris Rock. The idea of a black apostle is sort of funny; why not make it intentionally funny? They had George Carlin; why not make him say some funny lines? Why not have those two *write* some funny lines?<br /><br />But no. As it is, I'm not sure what the film really is. The heroine's deadpan, bored delivery might be a clue.<br /><br />Apparently some viewers thought it was a satire or comedy, but perhaps it's sarcasm. Or just plain meanness, trying to convince others to suffer through this tedious film. Or maybe - maybe they really thought it was funny - no, wait, I'm starting to entertain really wacky thoughts here.

0679781307|5.0|Winner of the Boston Review's Fisk Fiction Prize, this thematically complex story is written in clear, simple, lucid prose. It is a straightforward telling of an encounter that was to mark fifteen year old Michael Berg for life. The book, written as if it were a memoir, is divided into three parts.  The first part of the book deals with that encounter.<br /><br />While on his way home from school one day in post-war Germany, Michael becomes ill. He is aided by a beautiful and buxom, thirty six year old blonde named  Hanna Schmitz. When he recovers from his illness, he goes to Frau Schmitz's home to thank her and eventually finds himself seduced by her and engaged in a sexual encounter. They become lovers for a period of time, and a component of their relationship was that Michael would read aloud to her. Michael romanticizes their affair, which is a cornerstone of his young life. Then, one day, as suddenly as she appeared in his life, she disappears, having inexplicably moved with no forwarding address.<br /><br />The second part of the book deals with Michael's chance encounter with Hanna again. He is now a law student in a seminar that is focused on Germany's Nazi past and the related war trials.  The students are young and eager to condemn all who, after the end of the war,  had  tolerated the Nazis in their midst. Even Michael's parents do not escape his personal condemnation. The seminar is to be an exploration of the collective guilt of the German people, and Michael embraces the opportunity,  as do others of his generation, to philosophically condemn the older generation for having sat silently by. Then, he is assigned to take notes on a trial of some camp guards.<br /><br />To his total amazement, one of the accused is Hanna, his Hanna.  He stoically remains throughout the trial, realizing as he hears the evidence that she is refusing to divulge the one piece of evidence that could possibly absolve her or, at least, mitigate her complicity in the crimes with which she is charged.  It is as if she considers her secret  more shameful than that of which she is accused. Yet, Michael, too, remains mute on the fact that would throw her legal, if not her moral, guilt into question.  Consequently, Hanna finds herself bearing the legal guilt of all those involved in the crime of which she is accused and is condemned accordingly.<br /><br />The third part of the book is really the way Michael deals with having found Hanna, again. He removes himself from further demonstration and discussion on the issue of Germany's Nazi past. It affects his decisions as to his career in the law,  eventually choosing a legal career that is isolating. He marries and has a child but finds that he cannot be free of Hanna. He cannot be free of the pain of having loved Hanna. It is as if Hanna has marked him for life. He divorces and never remarries. It is as if he cannot love another, as he loved Hanna. Michael then reaches out to Hanna in prison,  indirectly, through the secret they share of what she seems to be most ashamed. Yet, he carefully never personalizes the contact. The end, when it comes, is almost anti-climatic.<br /><br />The relationship between Michael and Hanna really seems to be analogous to the relationship between the generations of Germans in post-war Germany. The affair between Michael and Hanna is representational of the affair that Germany had with the Nazi movement. The eroticism of the book is a necessary component for the  collective guilt and shame that the Germans bear for the Holocaust, as well as for the moral divide that seemingly exists between the generations. Yet, the book  also shows that such is not always a black and white issue, that there are sometimes gray areas when one discusses one's actions in the context of the forces of good and evil. There is also the issue of legal and moral responsibility. One would think that the two are synonymous, but they are not always so.  It also philosophizes on the ability tolove another/a nation  who/that  was complicit in war crimes. This is an insightful, allegorical  book that defies categorizing. It is also a book that is a wonderful selection for a reading circle, as it has a wealth of issues that are ripe for discussion. This is simply a superlative book. Bravo!love another/a nation  who/that  was complicit in war crimes. This is an insightful, allegorical  book that defies categorizing. It is also a book that is a wonderful selection for a reading circle, as it has a wealth of issues that are ripe for discussion. This is simply a superlative book. Bravo!

B00008ADPF|2.0|Nickelback just might be talented, but we never find out if they can fly because they're unwilling to spread their wings.  It's probably coincidental that &quot;Someday&quot; sounds so much like &quot;How You Remind Me&quot;, but it's not surprising, because they draw on such a small vocabulary of chords, progressions, rhythms, sounds, and song structures.  No, most attempts to try something different don't generally work well, but it's worth seeking out the few examples of compelling music that does something different from everything else.  After all, if the latest Nickelback song doesn't do anything for you that the last one didn't, there's not much point to listening to it instead of the one you already have.  The thing that makes albums like Pink Floyd's &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; or Jeff Buckley's &quot;Grace&quot; great is not just that they say what they want to say so perfectly but that they evoke something that no other album does.  And it often can take a number of listens to learn to appreciate what new kinds of music have to offer.  But it's worth it; you are capable of experiencing far more range of feeling than Nickelback is capable of getting across to you.  If you already have some Nickelback, either a CD or just a couple of mp3s, I would recommend trying to find some bands that evoke something relatively different;  I won't pretend to know what you will like, but it wouldn't hurt to check out some classics like Led Zeppelin, Soundgarden, Pink Floyd, Smashing Pumpkins, or Jimi Hendrix and figure out what other music works well with you.  You might not like all or even most of it, but at least you'll find something you like and you'll expand your horizons.
B000002LVB|4.0|&quot;Sweet Jane&quot; and Rock and Roll&quot; are the popular tunes here, &quot;Who Loves the Sun&quot; and &quot;Oh, Sweet Nuthin&quot; are just as good-but basically this is the VU without John Cale (Or Warhol and Nico, for that matter) making an album that could appeal to Stones fans, or even maybe Skynyrd fans. It's also very good, and the chord progressions would be a much bigger influence on 70's rock than anyone has ever mentioned. Good songs, no real experimentation or punk/metal/psychedelic leanings. Lou Reed was more dominant in the band than ever on this album, but the other members do contribute to the sound. Think of &quot;Ballad of Dwight Frye&quot; by Alice Cooper, &quot;Angie&quot; by the Rolling Stones, or &quot;Signs&quot; by the 5 Man Electrical Band-that's the musical territory the first ever experimental rock band explore on &quot;Loaded&quot;. In otherwords, it's good stuff-but NOT avant garde.
0425152251|5.0|Unlike one of the reviewers on the book cover, I read this book while taking a course that dips now and then into western philosophy, and I was glad to report that I got a good grade for it! <br />When one writes a story that can get its readers good grades, that means the book is not only a good one, but also a rewarding read. First of all, we are introduced to Sophie, 14 going on 15, with the problems of a normal teenager would face around the world. Going through her mail, she finds a letter addressed to her. Reading it unwittingly sends her into a headlong lecture of the whole three thousand years' history of western philosophy, from the classical to the modern, from Aristotle to Goethe, from &quot;Politics&quot; to &quot;Faust&quot;. In which she discovers who she is, and the mysterious mailer.<br />And they said you have to have encyclopedias in your home. Buy this instead and read it to your sons, daughters, and/or friends. This is a valuable book meant to be read and kept as an heirloom.
B00004W510|5.0|N.B. The official review above is somewhat misleading as it is written as if Joan Baez composed &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot; from this album; she did not. Robbie Robertson, guitarist of the band is the composer for anyone who didn't already know. Anyway, now to the important stuff...<BR>Having had this album for a couple of months I find myself in a far more settled place in which to write a review that I know I can stand by for good. This band is absolutely essential, in the way that the Beatles, Elvis, Cash, Springsteen, the Stones, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye etc. etc. are essential. They captured in its purest form a method of storytelling that still has as much potency and passion now as it ever did back in the late 1960's. This, in my estimations (as well as many, many other musicians and music-lovers) forcefully eclipses any of the &quot;classic&quot; albums at the time (St. Peppers and Pet Sounds being the most acclaimed) in every single way.<br />From the stunning sway of &quot;Across the Great Divide&quot;, right through to the undeniable anguish of &quot;King Harvest&quot;, each song tells a vivid and engaging story, sung with such passion and played with such amazing talent, that this is simply the most artistically important album of the 20th century (in my eyes at the very least; I know at least some people agree).<br />If nobody knows the members of the Band, prepare to be engaged in the kind of enthralling empathy that no other band I have come across has yet instilled in me...<br />The Band consists of three vocalists; Richard Manuel (Pianist), Rick Danko (bassist) and Levon Helm (drummer), of which Richard was most definitely the lead. His voice is truly inspiring, breathtaking, and (once you know his fate) absolutely heartbreaking. Listen to &quot;Whispering Pines&quot; or &quot;Rockin' Chair&quot; off this album and you will know what I mean... indeed, buy the &quot;Classic Albums&quot; dvd of this to see just what sort of impact Richard had on the music and people involved with the Band. For those of you who do not know the Band, Richard committed suicide back in 1986 while touring with the reunited (ex-Robertson) band. <br />Let's not forget the force of the other vocalists and musicians within however, because each made a massive impact upon the music that came out of the &quot;Big Pink&quot; and &quot;Band&quot; sessions. The most impressive songs on this album are, without doubt &quot;Across The Great Divide&quot;, &quot;...Dixie...&quot;, &quot;Unfaithful Servant&quot;, &quot;Whispering Pines&quot;, &quot;Rockin' Chair&quot; and &quot;When You Awake&quot;, all bona-fide classics. The other songs are just as impressive once you know the Band's music, but are a little more dense in scope and may take a few listens to fully appreciate. <br />Helm, a superb drummer, singer, and mandolin player, sings &quot;Dixie&quot; with the kind of passion nobody from out of the South of the US could. It's undeniable and frighteningly haunting. Similarly, Danko (also deceased) puts in superb vocal performances on &quot;When You Awake&quot; and &quot;Unfaithful Servant&quot;. <br />All the musicians (except Robertson, who wrote nearly all the songs) are exceptional multi-instrumentalists who exhibit the kind of genius (and that includes Robertsons' guitar playing and songwriting) that maybe just one part of every classic band has; the disturbing thing is that every member of this band has it in spades.<br />The music itself is breathtaking in scope, not because of its component parts (although they too are magical), but because of the force and complexity of the textures that these musicians created... created, may I add, in the midst of post &quot;St. Peppers&quot; flimsy and whimsical psychedelia, and not scarred in any way by it (as much of the late 60's, early 70's music was). The underbelly of the songs is based upon Helm's substantial drumming, Danko's persistent and beautiful bass and Garth Hudson's complex textures of hammond and Clavinette.<br />This is timeless music for timeless troubles, music we can all grasp something from, whether it is hope, empathy, sadness, (envy!), or simple inspiration and respect.<br />Once of the very few &quot;perfect&quot; rock albums, in my opinion far greater than any album that came out of the '60's or 70's and simply one of the most awe-inspiring examples of songwriting, storytelling and musicianship that you will ever bear witness to.<BR>Timeless and essential.
0425176517|5.0|When I first reached for the book I didn't expect it to be a controversial read. Six hours later, I was agape, in denial and most certainly scandalized. Without giving away the plot, suffice to say that Dame Agatha had written her ultimate masterpiece when she decided to write &quot;...Roger Ackroyd&quot;. <br />For first-time readers: Don't be fooled by the length of the novel. The clues are there, sprinkled neatly and merrily along with the darned red herrings. You have to read it slowly, as it was with most of her novels. <br />The story: a doctor was called by Roger Ackroyd to discuss an important matter, but before he could divulge it further he was interuppted by the evening post. The matter was left there, and the doctor went home, seeing his host a bit disturbed. When he got home another call came in and announced that Mr Ackroyd was dead. Thus Poirot came into the scene and began nosing around. The solution was truly one of the most surprising in literature history.<br />The novel became the measuring rod for future mystery and detective novels, although its controversy is undeniable. My suggestion is that you ignore the controversy for the moment and concentrate on the story.
6305350205|4.0|This movie has been labeled as the &quot;worst&quot; in the Star Trek movie series.<br />I admit that it does not really compare with the other &quot;original cast&quot; movies. The script is not the best and it has a lot of &quot;cheesy&quot; moments. Some of the jokes are a little over the top for a Star Trek movie (especially if the joke doesn't work). The movie starts to go down hill towards the end, but I don't think the movie sucks.<br />There are some great moments in this movie as well as some bad ones, but I think that the good outweighs the bad. It's a movie worth seeing even if you are not a &quot;Trekkie&quot; and just a casual fan of the series. It's still a very watchable movie.
0425098532|5.0|Sure, there is always Ten Little Indians (also the best!!!) and Cards on the Table. But this one is very neatly plotted that - as it was with every other Christie - you can never expect what will surface just as soon as you thought you had it all figured out. Here, although the great Dame herself claimed would not revert to using Freudian complexes, she used a few here, perhaps unintentionally. And when the end of book one, you can't help but thinking that only one person can commit the murder under those given circumstances. Read it!
B00005NIL9|5.0|Being a huge fan of the band, I would say Fire and Water is the strongest Free showcase. Rodger's voice just gets better and better, and Kossy's vibrato is at it's pinnacle. I like the mix of ballads and rockers, and naturally you have \\"All Right Now\\" as the outro. For me, it all starts to go downhill for Free after this disc. A must for anyone who appreciates 70's Rock.
B00005LQ04|4.0|I could of probably lived without 10 over-the-top seconds of \\"Suspiria.\\"  Those 10 seconds are graphic to the point of porn.  No doubt Argento fans would say that such scenes are what make Argento Argento.  Whatever.  That said, this is a really good movie with a terrific look.  Argento's use of colors and architecture to establish mood (dread) is simply astounding.  I have to believe Kubrick borrowed from Argento, heavily, in his making of  \\"The Shining.\\"  I almost didn't finish watching \\"Suspiria\\" due to a graphic murder in the beginning.  What kept me hanging in there was the stylish way Argento was framing his scenes.  Hairy and taloned arms appearing out of the dark, a haunting run through the woods, wild and/or garish art deco interiors that have you thinking Jack the Ripper picked out the colors and patterns, and a building that looks like it was designed in Hell. <br />The plot?  It's ok.  Not as weak as some have suggested, but it does have holes - holes you don't spend much time pondering, since it's your eyes and ears Argento is after.  Acting?  Almost seems beside the point.  You have your various grotesque characters, some with very big teeth, doing evil things. Jessica Harper is, however, very good as the waif-like ballet student.  Her physical slightness, her big eyes, all contribute to the impression that she is surrounded by monstrous horror.  How will she escape? Watch and see.  The soundtrack, especially if you have surround sound, is effective and eerie. Lots of evil whisperings and other ominous sounds jump from unexpected directions. So the makers of the dvd are also to be applauded.  It's as crisp a picture as you can imagine.  (Guess Argento wanted those \\"reds\\" to really show.)
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This is for anyone who gave this album below 5 stars or who doesn't understand why it deserves a perfect rating.  This can be taken as a guide for how to listen to ANY new CD which you have bought.<br />1) Listen to the ENTIRE album without stop.  It will sound completly new and foreign, and it will probably also sound all the same, don't let this throw you. (anybody who writes a review at this point is making a big mistake)<br />2) Wait for 1-2 days. (listen to other music)<br />3) Listen to parts of the album (those which you prefer) until you get really sick of them.  I'm talking 2-3 tracks at most. (These will probably be close to the beggining of the album, or the be the ones you heard before on the radio or anywhere else) <br />5) Wait atleast a week. (listen to lots of other music)<br />6) Listen to the ENTIRE album again.  Start to pick out the songs that you didn't appreaciate at first.  You will discover that these are the best ones of the album.  The reason is that your ear only catches at first what is familiar to you.  You probably won't like the &quot;hook&quot; songs anymore, that were included (usually) at the beggining of the album, since you listened them to death.<br />7) At this point you can listen at will to whatever catches your ear, you will slowly progress through the album and discover the hidden rhythms that you &quot;somehow&quot; didn't hear for the past couple weeks.<br />8) If it is a good album, you will now begin to listen religiously to it. (Discovering even more of it's genius)  If not, you will throw it down in disgust because the only thing there was to the ablum was &quot;hook&quot; songs and filler.<br />This is the progression that I seem to go through with most of the CD's that I buy.  I just thought I'd share it because APC makes the perfect example for this method.<br />If you listen to Thirteenth Step with this guide, I guarantee you will appreaciate it, and come to cherish the album.
B00008DDXC|4.0|This film is not as good as the book, but still a very good film. There are a few scenes from the book that I wish had made the final cut. It does drag a little after the climax, but those scenes are need to tie up loose plot lines as well as items that might have an impact in future editions.

This is my 3rd favorite video, with #2 being Billy Squire Live In The Dark and #1 being Roger Waters In The Flesh Live.<BR>Oh, CHICAGO Live at the Greek ain't to shabby either.<br />ACDC Live at Donington is a must-have DVD.

067101756X|5.0|I found this book highly interesting about the controversial Roswell UFO mystery. Add to that the fact that it's written by Lt.Col. (retired) Philip Corso, a military officer with a stellar reputation, for whom this book serves as what seems like a testimonial. He certainly didn't do it out of personal greed for money, he was in his 80s when he decided to write this book. It looks like he's someone who wanted to speak out before he died of old age about something his government, which he served honorably, was keeping from and lying to the public about. Even if you don't believe this story is true, the thoughts presented in this book by Lt.Col. Corso ranks as a highly entertaining science fiction read with the ideas (facts?) in it. It goes into not only the Roswell cover-up, but also how the US military went about dispersing alien hardware to US firms (most of it by Lt.Col. Corso himself), and how alien technology has been and continues to touch our lives today. That part of the book was really weird to think about. Personally, it was a page turner for me, and I finished it within a week.

Secondly, the name of the film gives away the ending, which is  stuipid. No one likes forgone conclusions, that's why everyone hated Titanic. ...
B00005RDSM|3.0|\\"The Disney version\\" of \\"Peter Pan\\" clearly demonstrates what is so wrong with \\"The Disney version\\" of too many classic stories. It turns Barrie's play into a simple adventure tale, in which the dramatic and (dare I say it?) psycho-sexual elements at the center of Barrie's fantasy are discarded wholesale.<br />There are defensible reasons for this, I suppose. Drama requires talking, but characters who stand around gabbing bring an animated film to a dead stop. I also suspect that Disney simply didn't understand the story in the first place. It wasn't until the Ashman/Menken era that Disney films finally developed any dramatic focus.<br />It's unfortunate, because \\"Peter Pan\\" starts off well enough. The late Sammy Fain's \\"Second Star from the Right,\\" played over the title cards, has one of the most-ravishing melodies in the history of American popular music. (Look for the albums \\"Bibbidi Bobbidi Bach\\" and \\"Heigh-Ho! Mozart\\" for superb \\"classical\\" arrangements of Disney tunes.) The \\"You Can Fly\\" sequence is inspired (and can you name any other pop song with an accelerando passage?). But everything quickly bogs down thereafter, with Captain Hook's machinations providing the only fun.<br />There just aren't enough good things in the Disney \\"Peter Pan\\" to make up for its failure to treat the source material in an honest and serious fashion.
0792839692|5.0|Logan's Run was one of my faves as a kid. It was different from othe Sci Fi at the time. It created a weird world that was great to watch. I also watched the TV show version and loved it too (sure it was just a TV show and not quite as grand as the the more expensive flick but it was still weird enough to keep me watching). You've just got to love a show that creates it's own strange world and takes you away from reality. Logan has it's own style that provides just the right escape from the played out worlds of other Sci Fi flicks and shows. Give this a chance if you want something that's different and you've never seen it.

The album has neither the astonishing musicianship of &quot;Are You Experienced?&quot; (Jimi Hendrix), the mysticism and inventiveness of &quot;Led Zeppelin&quot; or the heart and soul of &quot;Rocks&quot; (Aerosmith), and it is a wonder that Back in Black deserves to be mentioned among these titles. It has also abandoned many of the things that made their earlier albums great, such as the raw, unpolished sound of the guitars in &quot;Powerage&quot; and &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot;,the band on the road tales of &quot;High Voltage&quot;, and even the consistency of  &quot;Highway to Hell&quot;. In short, they have not advanced as musicians or changed their style enough from the previous albums to make it as exciting as it could have been, whereas albums like &quot;Van Halen&quot; prove to be far more inventive and revolutionary despite lacking depth. Despite these complaints, Back in Black is nevertheless a great album because of its playfulness and sense of fun throughout, especially on tracks like &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot; and &quot;Shoot to Thrill&quot;. And although the guitars have lost most of their raw appeal, Angus and Malcolm Young still manage to provide more memorable hooks and riffs than before. But what really makes Back In Black a success is AC/DC's never ending dedication to  simple, loud and juvenile rock n' roll.
B00005LMBK|5.0|I have never heard Damon Albarn before, i found about this album from a combination of play on mtv and knowledge of past projects including Dan the Automator and Del, a unique halfway underground rapper who pops up in the strangest places.  Anyone coming from my perspective will be surprised by this album - hell, anyone will be surprised by this album.  It is an utterly effortless fusion of delicious lo fi hip hop, relaxed dub, and energetic punk rock.  The combination of such bold and surefooted experimentation and the catchy hooks that got it on mtv in the first place is unprecedented.<BR>The album is varied and it has a few slow points (Man Research, Sound Check), but they don't really get in the way, they just give breathing room between the joyful and dark whirlwind of culture.  As for good tracks, there is the rhythmic gimmick of rock joint 5/4, the impenetrable lyrics and the pure punk power of Punk.  Clint Eastwood (why is it called clint eastwood?) is a perfect single, with its catchy hook and Del's paced lyricism, and Rock the House and Double Bass are excellent bits of rhythmically infections production.  Latin Simone is a great song, and the whole Cuban thing comes out of nowhere, and M1 A1 - well, I don't get it, but I can't help singing along with what I think Albarn is saying.<BR>All in all, this Gorillaz project is a total success of an experiment.  The persona of the band is fascinating and adds to the fun and humorous but kind of dark atmosphere of the most delightfully weird pop cd ever made.

0553579908|3.0|I loved the first book (maybe even an A+) but was disappointed in this one because of some of the things that pleased me in the first. Primarily the way that he lets awful things sometimes happen to good characters he's developed (like disability or death) - you really didn't know what was going to happen. He also was developing some very interesting deeper structures outside the basic warring noble families. The second novel keeps that going, but it seems like at times he's just casting dice to decide on plot lines. It may be he (rightly) feels his world and characters are robust enough to cope with such haphazard treatment, and that it reflects the context of the massive uncertainty of a civil war - but some sort of direction is enjoyable in a novel. The larger things are still there (the mysterious atrocities rising beyond the wall; the return of magic with Danerys and her dragons), but there's not much of a sense of a deadline with them.<br />In one way this may be good - you can just enjoy the interaction of substantial characters in a coherent fantasy world without it being forced into a typical exposition-rising tension-climax-d&eacute;nouement structure. But I didn't enjoy it as much because the first did always seem to be more clearly going somewhere. Furthermore, while this is recounting the descent into treacherous conflict, the sheer volume and ubiquity of sickeningly brutal murder, molestation and mutilation of innocents is a bit overwhelming. George, are you just getting a little too much pleasure out of all this? I mean, it's your world and your narrative - you don't have to linger quite so long or often over these accounts. Or you could even pick things up a little!<br />I hope he doesn't go too Orson Scott Card, but there are getting to be a few too many world/era changing characters. The only one I've seen get away with this is Saberhagen in his Swords series. Each of a dozen God-forged swords are world shakers, and each book resolves itself, but the swords pop up here and there, interacting in novel ways, and could keep doing so indefinitely.words pop up here and there, interacting in novel ways, and could keep doing so indefinitely.
0312263120|1.0|This book was a huge disappoinment.  If you know the difference between an algorithm and a key or symmetric and asymmetric encryption then do not buy this book.  The author needs to find someone with some knowledge of encryption to be a co-writer or a proof reader.  The book is not believable in so many areas it makes the story very difficult to get excited about. I kept thinking that the author was trying to write a Tom Clancy style book (the NSA doesn't send language professors to do field work any more than the CIA would send Jack Ryan into the field) but just did not do his homework to make it at all believable.  Tom Clancy makes it believable becuase he does his homework so well; this author does not.  Don't buy this book.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|First off I'd like to say that this is a brilliant album.  This is not why i decided to write a review though. There are already many positive and helpful reviews here.  There is one however that tends to bother me.  This mropinion guy seems to enjoy buying great albums then trashing them on this site.  I guess he doesn't have very good tastes in music (or a life for that matter).  I'm a fan of other bands such as The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, and Black Sabbath, all bands he has reviewed.  This guy obviously has the attention span of a rodent.  This &quot;ghetto&quot; talk he uses in his reviews also suggests that he should stop dishonoring great albums such as &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; by even touching them to buy them.  He should start listening to rap albums (the crap that he is worthy to listen to).  Rap will fade along with this loser.<br />Thank You and Good Night!

B00000F14B|5.0|I don't remember how many times I have watched this movie, including the remake with Matthew Broderick.  Robert Preston is the one and only Music Man, hands down.  No one will remember any other movies he did, except may be for Victor Victoria, for which he actually won an Oscar.  Joyous music, and wonderfully innocent story.  Enough said.
B00023BLXK|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. And Deigo Luna is soo hot. Amost as hot as drew fuller. Almost.<br />It has a great plot; A girl moves to Cuba with her family for her dad, who gets a job there. She meets the other rich people in the hotel, and finds she doesn't like them.<br />  She accidentally knocks glasses out of a young waiter's (Luna) hand, resulting in a lost job for him.<br />  I'm not going to say anymore, exsept the fact that if you love romatic storys with a little bit of comedy here and there, a little bit of history, and a tiny, insy bitsy bit of violence, then this is the movie for you. 100 stars.
0316168815|2.0|When I saw an interview with author Alice Sebold on the Today show about a month ago, I felt compelled to read this book. I liked the author and found a familiarity in her personality, as if she could be one of my friends. Unfortunately, I thought the book was extremely depressing and did not look forward to my nightly sessions of reading after a long day at the office. It starts with the detailed description of the rape and murder of a sweet 14 year old girl. When the book started out this way I thought it would get better but it continued on a depressing path describing her family's dissolution, her friends' wierd adolescent life ramblings and later, the supernatural invasion of their bodies. The best part of the book was the ending, where the subject (the murdered girl) addresses what the afterlife is like. That part was very descriptive and strangely uplifting after an arduous read. It was disappointing overall and I probably won't pick up another Alice Sebold novel.
B0001W8Q9Y|1.0|It is pretty sad when Ms Spears' fans start listening to this band. Do yourself a favor and buy Afraid of Sunlight again and pretend it is a new album: you'll have a much bigger thrill... trust me.
B000294SFW|5.0|Like clockwork, motorhead churn out another album every two years and again they hit ya right between the eyes with another motorclassic. This is great stuff; In the name of tragedy, suicide, Down on me, Killers, In the black and Fight being the stand out tracks. If you like it loud, fast, and heavy, then don't pass this up. Lemmy is rock n' roll and Motorhead is back again to shoot you full of noise and what wonderfull noise it is.
B00005A46T|2.0|This album is very repetative. All the songs sound the same and are poorly done. The title track is 15 minutes of sh** if you ask me. I would not want to waste 15 minutes of my life listening to that song. Recommend Metallica or Motograter over this CD anytime.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|I have always thought westerns were boring and before now haven't watched one long enough to appreciate it. Today I watched this movie for the first time and I have a new appreciation for movies of this genre. The premise of this film is that $200,000 lies in a confederate grave, and two men - Blondie and Tuco must join together to find the loot. Blondie is the only one that knows which grave the money is in, and Tuco is the only one that knows where the graveyard itself is. A third man, Angel Eyes is also after the loot. Backed by a wonderful score, this is a great movie for anyone. Even if you hate westerns like I did, this is a good starting point to begin with.<br />This dvd set is great from the packaging to the materials included. We get a 2 disc set in a nice cardboard outer box. That part caught my attention in the store. Inside is a nice booklet about the film, as well as mini lithograph posters modeled after the original movie posters. The movie has been restored and couldn't look better, and the restored 15 minutes of footage should satisfy longtime fans of the movie that have not seen the added material that until now had been cut for its U.S. theatrical release. Oh and did I mention the film's score? It is a good one and definately one of the most recognizable scores from any film. Extras are plentiful on this set although I haven't seen all of those yet. My one and only gripe? I think that a 5.1 surround track should have been added but it wasn't. It would sound much better than just hearing it on the 2 channels, but other than this I can find no wrong in the dvd set we have been given. I watched this movie because someone told me it was a great movie, and now I am telling you that you should see it. Even if you normally don't go for westerns you might be surprised at what you see. And at the price it is being sold, it is a dvd that is well worth owning if you enjoy it.
B000002H2H|5.0|People who think that Metallica sucks are complete idiots. They are poser rockers if they perfer some crap band like Slipknot. This album is flawless and show what Metallica is: the greatest metal band of all time. Highly recomend this album.
0385510438|3.0|As usual, a good storyteller will always deliver something.  My problem was the shift between thriller and small town character analysis.  The storyline continually switched back and forth.  It made for two really good tales, but neither added up to one excellent one.
B00008CLOA|5.0|very few words are required to write about the greatness of this hugely succesful cd recorded by the floyd which also happens to be my favourite along with the wall and wish you were here.highly recommended.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Van Halen's first album is a pure classic, and certainly a milestone in rock music. On this album, Eddie Van Halen shows all his talent, starting the &quot;Guitar Virtuoso&quot; fame, changing the face of hard rock music for the years to come...<br />All songs on the album are great and David Lee Roth's voice was really original for the time. It's tough to believe this album was recorded in 1978, sounds really 80's...<br />Well, it's a great buy!
B00000DOYH|5.0|When I turned 13, my father gave me Physical Graffiti.  Upon listening to it for the first time, I was thinking that it was the dumbest album I had ever heard.  I didn't want to dissapoint my dad.<BR>      So, as the months went by, I bought Led Zeppelin III, IV and Presence.  I was impressed, so I decided to give Physical Graffiti another try.<BR>     Boy, am I glad I did.  Every song in the album is perfect.  On this CD, you get more of a bluesy feel, especially on the second CD.  <br />DISC 1: 1. Custerd Pie: Great start to the CD. Some great riffs by Page.<BR>        <BR>        2. The Rover: Wow... REALLY great song.  If you walked into my house, you could see me tearing my hair out trying to play it.<BR>        3. In My Time Of Dying: This is my favorite song by Zep (besides Stairway To Heaven).  The guitar solos and riffs by Page are simply amazing.  Bonham shows some of his greatest drumming in this song.  And the lyrics are very neat.<BR>        4. Houses of the Holy: Really catchy song with REALLY catchy riffs.<BR>        5. Trampled Under Foot: One of my favorites on the album.  The keyboards in this song are awesome.  When i played the piano, I tried to learn this.<BR>        6. Kashmir: If i asked my friends if they liked this song, I'd get a whole lot of &quot;THAT SONG SUCKS!!&quot;  Well, i disagree.  This is a wonderful melodic song.<BR>DISC 2  1. In The Light: Slow at first, but once you get into it(which is about two minutes in) it gets really catchy.<BR>        2. Bron-Yr-Aur: Short song, but wonderful acoustic on Page's part.<BR>        3. Down By The Seaside: This was actually one of my favorite songs on the album.  It is very catchy and has great solo in the middle of song.<BR>        4. Ten Years Gone: Wonderful song... good guitar... like most of the songs on the second cd, this song gets catchy further into the song<BR>        5. Night Flight: I really liked this song.  It has a touch of the blues, and still sounds like Zeppelin.<BR>6. The Wanton Song: VERY good song.  Really catchy right from the start.  Makes me wanna get up and dance around.  Plant's voice sounds strange (at least to me)<BR>        7. Boogie With Stu: blues song all the way.  Theres even some great piano.  I love this song just because of the soul in it.  It makes me wanna listen to blues over and over again.<BR>        8. Black Country Woman: good song, but not the best on the cd by far.<BR>        9. Sick Again: Great end to a wonderful cd.  Has some good guitar playing.  Sounds like classic Zep
014028009X|5.0|Maybe by now it's too late to review this book since it's been a while since the movie came out and it was a very popular one. However, I consider the written word, books specifically, an art not to be lost. This is especially true in the form of this book. I'm not so much for classifying it under the term &quot;chick-lit&quot; as it's been done in some places. Yes, the heroine may be a woman, a single woman with common everyday struggles, but it lacks something every other &quot;chick lit&quot; book I've ever read has. There's no frivolous narrative here. True, she does complain a lot about the size of her thighs but even when she's deep into appearances, alcohol and men, she never stops feeling strangely real. I don't make a habit of saying this about any book but you'll feel as if you know Bridget for the very simple reason that she's made up of every woman you know, you included! The author did a great job of developing every single character in this book from the ones you'll love to the ones you'll hate. That alone is so deserving of praise. <BR>It's a very hard book to put down so prepare to be absorbed into the story, to laugh out loud quite a few times and to feel, even in some tiny way, oddly relating to Bridget's everyday tribulations. So yes, see the movie but definitely, definitely read this book, it's so much better.
B00000ADG2|1.0|Why indeed?  This will never do -- as one critic, Croaker, said of John Keats.  Oh that Ms. Hill was an Emily Dickinson or even a Jennie Lind ...  Why the toneless sound, chasing vainly after a melodic line and harmonic consistency?  Why the baby-talk intonation?  Why the absence of simple voice quality?  Can anyone distinguish even a single word -- without cribbing it first from album notes?  I see her old CDs are a whopping $2.99.  Doubtless that is becuz they have been played down to scratches.  (Scatches r better!) It is possible to sing greatly without much voice and a one-octave range, but only if you are Billie Holiday.  I knew BH, and Lauryn ... you are no Lady Day!
B000001FP8|4.0|While maybe a bit shallow lyrically, &quot;New Jersey&quot; is still loads of 80's rock-fun. The album is pretty strong from the beginning to the end, and is loaded with catchy melody hooks, and powerful choruses. It's loaded with extremely polished and mainstream radio-friendly songs. A great album to sit down and unwind to.....or go crazy, whichever you prefer.<br />Jon and Richie wrote some songs by themselves, on others they had some professional help. <br />My personal favorite (both melodically and lyrically) is &quot;Wild is the Wind&quot;. It's an Awesome and Powerful song with a Great mellow intro. It was co-written by the always great composer Diane Warren.<br />And of course the great Desmond Child co-wrote some Powerful and Catchy anthems here. These are &quot;Bad Medicine&quot;, &quot;Born to be My baby&quot; and &quot;Blood on Blood&quot;. All are 100% Hits.<br />Jon single-handedly wrote the beautiful ballad &quot;Living in Sin&quot;, and together with Richie he wrote another great ballad &quot;I'll be there for You&quot;. Also Richie and Jon wrote &quot;Lay Your hands on Me&quot;, &quot;Homebound Train&quot; and &quot;99 In the Shade&quot;. All are catchy and energy-filled rock tunes.<br />&quot;Love for Sale&quot; is a bit more Country style. Very catchy tune.<br />This is a very strong album with many potential hits on it. A must-have for any fan of 80's Commercial Rock or Pop. Fun stuff.
B000023VR6|5.0|I consider myself to have a wide variety of musical tastes. I like Bob Marley, The Clash, Rancid, the musical \\"Rent\\" as well as the soundtrack for Oh Brother Where Art Thou. Point is, if I like music, I don't try to hide it. N.W.A.'s \\"Straight Outta Compton\\" was the first rap album I bought, when I was in 7th grade. I got really into the N.W.A. family, regardless of feuds and such, who was more popular or not. I was big into oldschool rap for awhile, not really giving the new school a chance, as I could hear it on the radio and it jsut wasnt the same as the good old school stuff.<br />Public Enemy, Run D.M.C., Wu Tang, N.W.A., and then the solo's from all Eazy-E, Ice Cube, Dr Dre and MC Ren were all great. I loved Dr. Dre's \\"The Chronic\\" so much, that I picked this up from eBay for $6, and it changed my views on new school rap. As I've said, I own albums of Bob Marley, The Clash, Rancid, Korn, Rage Against the Machine, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Sex Pistols,...a wide variety. This album is just so honest and personal that you can't not like it. The beats are sick as well, but I like the whole family aspect of Dr Dre best. He brought Snoop Dogg into the industry, and he revolutionized rap with The Chronic, as well as Straight Outta Compton, and now, a 3rd time, with 2001.<br />Friends of his died, Eazy-E, Tupac... this CD is a tribute to them. Best CD in existance
B0000DD7LB|2.0|Alright, everything on this is complete junk EXCEPT EVERYTIME, my god thats a good song. i listen to the cure and christian death and marilyn manson and i like that song. lyrically its amazing, and the video is also pretty deep. i wouldnt buy the cd for that one song, but id definitely download it within seconds of hearing it. which i did.
B0000C16OQ|5.0|I'm enjoying listening to this great soundtrack that I loved as a child after a long hiatus. I had it on 8-track 25 years ago. So it's fitting that I should get the 25th Anniversary Edition on CD. The 24 songs from the movie are just as everyone remembers them, so I'll talk about the Bonus Disc, which contains 10 alternative versions of the songs plus 2 previously unreleased instrumentals from the film.<br /><br />Track 1 on the Bonus Disc is an instrumental version of the film's theme, &#34;Grease&#34;, written and produced by Barry Gibb. Frankie Valli's voice has been replaced by a saxophone. The chorus is vocal, but the voices are not those in the original song. You could use this as a sing-along version, as it would be easy to sing over the sax. Tracks 2-5 are officially sing-along versions. &#34;Summer Nights&#34; includes the chorus vocals from the film and sounds good. &#34;You're the One That I Want&#34; has new chorus vocals of questionable merit. &#34;Sandy&#34; is a new arrangement. It's not as good as the film version, but you can sing along. Track 6 is the single version of &#34;Greased Lightning&#34; that you may have heard on the radio back in the day. It's differs from the original in that the bad words have been replaced for radio airplay. Tracks 7-8 are previously unreleased instrumentals from the film. &#34;Greased Up and Ready to Go&#34; is lively. Tracks 9-10 are mixes that I occasionally hear on the radio. The &#34;Grease Megamix&#34; and the &#34;Grease Dream Mix&#34; are fun, if awkward. Tracks 11-12 are Martian Remixes of &#34;Summer Nights&#34; and &#34;You're the One That I Want&#34;. They retain the original vocals, but set them to a Latin rhythm. They make pretty good dance tracks.<br /><br />This 2-disc set isn't in a jewel case. The case is paperboard with 4 panels that fold out. This is inside of a clear vinyl slip case on which the tracks are written. This isn't convenient packaging. On the bright side, the case won't crack in the mail. Tucked inside one of the panels is a booklet that contains lyrics and credits.<br /><br />The &#34;Grease: 25th Anniversary Deluxe Edition&#34; is a terrifically fun soundtrack to one of the all-time great movie musicals. And for all those preteen girls who go wild over the movie with each new generation, the bonus material is perfect for parties and horsing around.e of the panels is a booklet that contains lyrics and credits.

B000148KK2|1.0|I'm sorry but this latest DK album is so boring The performer is meant to breathe life and joy and pain into these songs. Diana Krall is just the opposite of that. Her voice is lifeless, her phrasing, liltless and uninspired . I love jazz, but I guess the reason Diana Krall is so successful is because, she is becoming &quot;jazz' for the masses. If you're a Diana Krall fan, you should probably pass on this one. I thought it was a bad choice of songs. S'boring. NOW IF YOU WANT snappyy, upbeat, Jazz Standards from the Great American Song Book, updated and sung like no one else, listen to DENA DEROSE &quot;Love's Holiday&quot; or any of her albums. &quot;Love's Holiday,&quot; is a delightful collection of standards and two originals that showcases her versatility, resourcefulness and genuine talent.? She's great on standards that have been masterfully arranged here, including &quot;Close Your Eyes&quot; (from which the album title is taken.
B00008H2LB|2.0|despite what people may say, this is linkin park's third album, reanimation counts because it was almost completely different from hybrid theory.  the first album was nice when i was in 9th grade, but now when i listen to it, its quite repeditive. it seems like every song has a different intro, and then drops into the same pattern.  every song is the same, which gets boring and shows the bands limitations in writting rock/metal/whatever.  i picked up reanimation because this guy who used to give me rides played it all the time, and i thought it was interesting.  the album seemed to be more in the realm of the band's abilities, and impressed me.  they made a mediocre rock album, and then made a delightful rap album.  i enjoy techno, but a lot of the techno out there is crap, which brings me to meteora.  the album is quite plasticky and even more repeditive than hybrid theory.  the band has taken another turn and produced a more fake album in the style of much bad techno.  an odd jump, but id rather they make something new than them make another hybrid theory.  still, not worth buying, but worth one or two listens.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|This movie is a bit longish and could have done without several scenes, but nonetheless is still a fun and sweet film that deserves to be checked out at least once. It's a refreshing romantic comedy-- one that ties together several different love stories that can all be traced back to the Prime Minister, played by Hugh Grant.<br />Some of the love stories include a young boy who is in love with the most popular girl in school, a man in love with his best friend's wife (or the best friend as implied in the beginning), the Prime Minister falling for his secretary, and a writer who falls for his cleaning lady. Some of the love stories (though none of what I mentioned) could have been left out. Some were just a bit much, like the story about the couple who met doing body double work on a film. The scenes are just awkward, and not just because their nude the whole time. Otherwise, the stories create a nice woven effect throughout the film and are incredibly enjoyable and laugh out loud funny.<br />It's well-written and the cast is absolutely amazing. We are charmed with the presence of Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Keira Knightly, and many more. It's a film that will definitely make you smile and realize that &quot;love actually is all around us.&quot; Highly recommended!!
B00003CXCT|3.0|Well... If the special edition is all we get, then I hope Lucas had the wits to make the DVD release a special edition of the special editions.  Huh?  I'm a sucker for extras, so I didn't mind the additional footage.  What I mind now, however, is that those additions (especially Jabba and the scenes running around Cloud City) are technologically inferior to today's standards and only hurt the already much maligned releases.  Please, please, PLEASE everyone cross your fingers that Lucas saw fit to \\"clean up\\" the effects he added, to at least help these stand up to the visuals of his prequels.  I'm looking forward to this release with wary hesitance.
0783226888|5.0|I personally love this movie.  This movie features Bruce Willis as the Jackal, an assassin hired to kill a high level U.S. Government official.  The Jackal has many identities, costumes, and contacts to help him along the way.  The FBI, obviously trying to stop the Jackal before he kills, turn to the one type of person most unlikely to help them.... a terrorist. Deklin Moqueen, played well by Richard Gere, is enlisted to stop the Jackal due to their past history together.  There are some shocking twists and turns along the way before the end.  The end result is a movie that is unnecessarily being torn apart by critics, but will always have a nice spot in my DVD collection.<br />Note: Jack Black makes an appearance in this movie.  This is one of the first movies I remember seeing him in.  I won't give away what happens to him, but it definitely left an imprint in my mind.
6305609705|5.0|I watched this movie in 1978 when it first came out and was totally in awe!  Francis Ford Coppola spent almost 3 years making this film and it was well worth it.  The all star cast in this film rocks!  Everytime I watch this film, I wind up mimicing the characters.  The lines are memorable!  (I love the smell of Napalm in the morning.)  It is the greatest movie ever made!

Was my assumption ever wrong!!!<br /><br />This particular book (published by Signet Classics in Sept. 2003) of less than 150 pages has five parts:<br /><br />(1) Opening Pages.  They include a brief biography of Robert Louis Stevenson (1850 to 1894).  (Takes up 4% of the book.)<br />(2) Introductory Essay.  This was written by the late, famous Russian author Vladimir Nabokov.  (Takes up 20%.)<br />(3) The Actual Story.  Its original title is \\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" (1886).  (Takes up 65%.)<br />(4) Afterword to the Story.  It is written by a modern writer.  (Takes up 8%.)<br />(5) Selected Bibliography.  Outlines great works by and about R.L. Stevenson.  (Takes up 3%.)<br /><br />The introductory essay was an actual lecture Nabokov gave when he was associate professor at Cornell University from 1948 to 1959.  It gives a thorough, detailed analysis of this \\"seldom read\\" classic.<br /><br />The afterword consists of a shorter analysis of this classic by the modern writer Dan Chaon.  I felt that this afterword provided valuable insight regarding the story of Jekyll and Hyde.<br /><br />Chaon sums up the entire story:  \\"The structure of ['Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'] follows a path as indirect and elusive as its multiple narrative voices.  With its obliquely recorded incidents, its eyewitness accounts and sealed confessions, it resembles...a [police detective's] casebook--a collection of gathered clues, fragments, through which the clever detective may be able to...project a complete narrative.  Perhaps one of the most compelling aspects of this novel [of ten chapters] is that, in fact, there's so much left here for [the reader] to fill in, so many scenes that [the reader] can only imagine.  Such a structure creates fertile ground for allegory [a story with symbolic meaning] hunters, and there are indeed many convincing interpretations of this novel...The puzzle-like structure of the novel [which only has eight major male characters] creates a kind of Rorechach test, open to various interpretations.\\"  (A Rorechach test is where a person interprets inkblot designs.)<br /><br />The inspiration of this short novel is said to have come from a dream (or, perhaps more accurately, a nightmare) Stevenson had.  His actual writing is amazing and skillful in all chapters.  The writing especially of the last two chapters, chapters nine and ten, stood out for me.  Here, for example, is his actual description of what happened when somebody observed someone using Dr. Jekyll's concoction:  \\"He put the glass to his lips and drank at one gulp.  A cry followed; he reeled, staggered, clutched at the table and held on, staring with injected eyes, gasping with open mouth; as I looked there came, I thought, a change--he seemed to swell--his face became suddenly black and the features seemed to melt and alter--and the next moment, I had sprung to my feet and leaped back against the wall, my arm raised to shield me...[and] my mind submerged in terror.\\"<br /><br />Finally, the cover of this particular book is interesting.  It shows the shadow of a man in a top hat behind a window shade.  This can be taken to represent Hyde who is a shadowy character.<br /><br />In conclusion, this particular book has it all: an introduction by a late, well-known author, an intriguing mystery/horror story by a late, famous nineteenth century author, and an afterword by a gifted, modern writer.  Be sure to read this book to learn the true story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde!!!<br /><br />+++++ny convincing interpretations of this novel...The puzzle-like structure of the novel [which only has eight major male characters] creates a kind of Rorechach test, open to various interpretations.\\"  (A Rorechach test is where a person interprets inkblot designs.)<br /><br />The inspiration of this short novel is said to have come from a dream (or, perhaps more accurately, a nightmare) Stevenson had.

0316926345|5.0|Set in England during the reigns of George V, Edward VIII and George VI, Evelyn Waugh explores in this novel, the varying degrees of spirituality of members of the Marchmain family and the relationships that exists between them and others who share their lives.  Some family members weigh desires and progressive attitudes against social and religious convention and find the latter lacking, while others cling to old religious and social practices and seek to continue to enjoy the opulence of a soon to be, bygone era.  <br />Waugh documents the excesses and eventual downfall of the youngest son Sebastian, whose burden it is to confront his disillusionment with his faith, with his morally incorruptible mother.  Lady Marchmain's control over her children using her charm, piety and the religious doctrine she devoutly observes is unquestionable.  Each member of her family is affected to varying degrees, including the absent husband. <br />The novel's narrator and protagonist Charles Ryder, is a self-confessed agnostic and friend of Sebastian.  The story commences with Charles, who, at a low ebb in his life, is commissioned to command an infantry regiment during World War II and is despatched by train to an unknown location.  His sullen mood determines that he neither feels the need to know his destination nor does he particularly care.  Upon alighting the train to make camp Charles discovers he is within sight of Brideshead, the castle that was the Marchmain ancestral home and location of much happiness for him twenty years earlier.  Charles recalls that precious time and relates the story with a deep sense of nostalgia and recognition that those languid days of love and abundance are gone forever.  <br />Lady Marchmain commands abidance to Catholicism 'in a voice as quiet as a prayer and as powerful' from four very different children.  The elder son, Brideshead is pious and conservative, unamusing and annoyingly narrow-minded. Julia is a contemporary woman, smart and verybeautiful.  She agonises over her marriage to a 'colonial' who doesn't understand centuries of observance to certain social protocol and devotion to a church, which he considers encourages the perpetuation of guilt for its own purposes.  As Julia's angst is disclosed she is portrayed as a complex young woman who must reject her faith to marry. She eventually finds herself disappointed with her choices and is left wondering how life could have gone so awry.  <br />Sebastian is 'the most conspicuous man of his year by reason of his beauty, which is arresting, and his eccentricities of behaviour, which seem to know no bounds'. Sebastian's charm captivates Charles from the first moment he sees him. They become inseparable and live life at Oxford to the full, however Charles eventually realises that Sebastian drinks to escape, rather than 'through an excess of high spirits, in the love of the moment and with the wish to prolong and enhance it'. Charles must eventually come to the conclusion that he has 'lost' his perpetually sullen friend.<br />Cordelia is the youngest of the Marchmain children.  She is too young and devout of faith to fully understand her brother's dilemma, however she loves him unconditionally.  Cordelia also seems too young to be aware of her mother's need to control, yet after Lady Marchmain dies, Cordelia confides to Charles that her mother 'was saintly but she wasn't a saint' and that 'when people wanted to hate God, they hated mummy'. There is a resigned acceptance at her inability to love her mother and of the lapse of faith of her father, sister and beloved brother.<br />Sebastian's deep depression and inner battle to reconcile his beliefs with his mother's expectations of him, are exemplified by Charles' responses in the conversation that he and Sebastian shared 'in the collonade with the papers'.  Sebastian would not find true solace in his relationship with Charles because he perceived that Charles could not grasp the gravity of his dilemma,despite their mutual love.  Waugh's decision to portray Charles as irreligious adds depth to Sebastian's dilemma.  The reader is left with the distinct feeling that love does not 'conquer all' and that the chasm between being unaffected by religion and the need to be devout of faith is too wide to bridge for these two introspective young men.  The book's most amusing dialogue occurs when Sebastian, unable or not wishing to try to defend his faith, exclaims 'Oh don't be a bore, Charles.  I want to read about a woman in Hull who's been using an instrument'. <br />Lady Marchmain attempts to solicit Charles `to her side' in order that he assist her to deny Sebastian the alcohol he increasingly relies upon.  Initially charmed by her, Charles eventually recognises her ploy and rather than winning his confidence, Lady Marchmain's emotional blackmail succeeds in `closing the low door in the wall' and Charles is destined to no longer meet Sebastian in their `enchanted garden'.<br />Charles loses contact with the Marchmains until many years later when he and Julia are literally thrown together on a ship in a storm. It is a fitting climax to Charles' involvement with the Marchmain family that he and Julia should become lovers.  The raging storm could be perceived to be a metaphor for the consummation of their relationship and that in itself to some degree, closure to Charles' lost love for Sebastian.<br />Presumably Evelyn Waugh sought to mourn the passing of an era and to celebrate his 1930 conversion to Roman Catholicism.  In doing so he created an extraordinarily splendid tale.  The novel may be excused for glorifying the aristocracy, because it transports the reader to 'that enchanted garden' which is full of life's glorious excesses.  It is tragic to lose an enchanting, teddy toting, young man to the bottle and it is sad to see love lost on a technicality but it is comforting to watch Waugh's characters rediscover their faith despite sinking to desolation and despair before doing so. Brideshead Revisited is one of the most beautiful books I've ever read and I have no doubt I shall read it again.
0671027344|5.0|This book is definitly my favorite, without thinking twice!! It's got to be the most hilaiuos book i have read. It took me three hours to read this book, because i could seriuosly not put it down. The reassons why this book is so good, is because in some ways, it will be easy to relate to. The perks of being a wallflower is about a boy who doesn't fit in. his sister has some problems through the book and they evenutally get along. his brother is really popular and is away at college. The boy's name is charlie, and his best friend killed himself. Charlie is having a lot of trouble making friends, when he finally meets three seniors. the whole book is about what charlie experiences in his first year at high school. this book is a MUST READ.

014028009X|5.0|I was going to read this a year ago, decided after the first page I wasn't into it, then recently gave it another try. It was hilarious the whole way through! Bridget says things that many women think but would NEVER admit. She really cracked me up! I can't say enough great things about it. I have yet to see the movie, but I will definitely be reading more by Helen Fielding.
B0001AP12G|4.0|It is about time a rap/hip-hop album has been able to be this good. Nowadays, there are so many rappers who put out garbage to everybody's ears, but Kanye West changed that. Mostly every song works on this album because they show his true talent. The highlights on this album are &quot;Jesus Walks&quot; &quot;The New Workout Plan&quot; and &quot;Breathe In Breathe Out&quot; with Ludacris. AWESOME CD!
0064471837|3.0|This book could have been shortened by about 100 pages by cutting out parts in which the main characters just wandered around talking to people. The reason why I give it three stars is because I thought that it was a very original idea. I have not seen many fantasy books focus on people who work at \\"keeping dead down.\\" The characters were entertaining although not always fully 3D and developed. I know of many people that utterly love this trilogy and others that hate it but I seem to just find it average.
0385504209|1.0|I agree with those giving this book a low rating and am also surprized after all I had heard about it. I first read Greg Iles' book &quot;Footprints of God&quot;, which was recommended by Dan Brown, and liked it very much. So was disappointed with Brown's highly touted book. The big deal seemed to be the &quot;secret information&quot; that Jesus was married to Mary Magdeline with whom he had a child, which the &quot;Church&quot; was supposed to go to all costs to hide. The only Church mentioned is the Catholic Church, who supposedly wanted to label Mary M a prostitute so they would not have to worship her and could have a patriarchal religion - what nonsense! There was NO mention of Mary the mother of Jesus, whom the Catholics do revere. No mention of the possible reaction of the protestant churches to all this. A complete neglect of the really important question: did Jesus really rise from the dead and does he exist today as a living spirit who can change our lives and save us from our sins? No metaphyical aspects at all, no quantum theory to explain Jesus walking through walls. Just a whole lot of people commiting murder over the almost insignificant point of whether or not Jesus had married. Give me a break! But I guess a lot of people liked it so what do I know? I postpone my first book again!
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Avril has really grown up in this album; you can see something in her has matured since her last album. It's like a breath of fresh air without all the melodramatic B.S. that characterized her last album. This album rocks!
B000244FDW|2.0|I rented this mini some time ago, and although it was true to the text, it has some obvious flaws. The pacing is entirely off. There are some downplayed moments that should be poignant, which instead just feel like dead air. Most importantly, the performances leave much to be desired, as the two main characters, Lizzy and Darcy, are barely brought to life by the respective actors. I have to admit, my favorite parts of the adaptation were those with Darcy, not because of his character, but because the actor had the uncanny ability to barely open his mouth when brusquely and dully dead-panning his lines. His mouth remains a thin harsh line throughout the entre film, keep watch, you'll see!
B00005JMEW|1.0|Call me &quot;unfashionable&quot; but I thought this was a waste of time, money, film and otherwise good actors' time.  Alex, I'll take 'gratuitous bloodletting' for a thousand.  It was everything, especially the &quot;flying humans&quot; of Crouching Tiger, you've ever seen done all over again.  Ho hum.  I simply could not be more sick of violence; it bothers me, and carries no &quot;entertainment&quot; value whatsoever.  Give me Dances with Wolves, Farenheit 9/11, Forrest Gump or Field of Dreams anyday.  This was just plain awful.  If zero stars were available as an option, I'd have chosen it.
B0000C8AVI|5.0|I love this album.  However, I was disappointed that I didn't get the words with it.  I guess that is why I was able to buy it for $14.98.  Bob Dylan is a master in his own right, and the way he portrayed every song was awesome.  Now I must try to get the words, as I am an assistant minister at my church, and often am asked to sing solos.  I would feel privileged to sing some or all of the songs on this &quot;Slow Train Coming&quot; album.  I truly love it.
B0001GL3KE|5.0|I absolutely love this movie and find its style to be especially compelling.  The movie is basically 10 + love stories happening all at once.

6305428387|5.0|Catchy music, funny crashes, bar fight, a sledder who pees in the sled because he's so scared, calling each other names like Sanka and Yul Brynner....all make for a great laugh in the eyes of a teenager. I've shown this movie to dozens of teens and it never disappoints. The fact is that it's a true story of people chasing their dream, and it has a perfect blend of silly with poignant and great pace to keep adults and young adults alike INTERESTED and entertained the entire time.  Also, it follows real life at the end and doesn't have a bunch of no-name Jamaicans taking the gold at the Olympics....teens expect a Disney ending like that and appreciate seeing, instead, the truth.  However, ANYONE who watches it finds themselves rooting for these no-name Jamaicans and kind of wishing they would medal even though, realistically, they have no chance. BUY IT and watch it and show it to others...its timeless themes never go out of date.
B0000025LS|5.0|This is one of the Santana band's finest albums!It's the ideal blend of the percussive,psychedelic funky latin jazz/rock that Carlos Santana has made so famous!All of those bases are covered here,sometimes together as on &quot;Searchin&quot; and other times on songs like the grooving &quot;E Papa Re&quot;.Overall 'Zebop!' also marks a return from late 70's stabs at progressive rock and disco back to Santana's classic sound,marked by &quot;The Sensitve Kind&quot;,a JJ Cale cover very similar to the bands Woodstock-era radio hits of yore.The bluesy instrumental version of the standard &quot;I Love You Much Too Much&quot; shows that while strong tunesmiths in their own right Santana can TEAR IT UP on covers!&quot;Brightest Star&quot; is a very soulful ballad showcasing some KILLER organ work and a<BR>great vocal arrangement.<BR>            &quot;Changes&quot; and &quot;Winning&quot; are both catchy covers given<BR>a little dose of latin-rock even as the firey instrumentals<BR>&quot;Primera Invasion&quot; and the frenetic closering chant &quot;Hannibal&quot; are just shattering fabulous!Ditto for &quot;American Gypsy&quot;-noting that all four tracks wouldv'e fit perfectly on any of <BR>Santana's first trio of albums.Over twelve songs there is no filler,no weak songs and (as always) outstanding production.  And  happily it lacks the abundance of filler the permeated albums like 'Marathon' and the follow up 'Shango!'.So for those interested in a peak at the early 80's-era Santana,this album<BR>is the best choice by far,in addition to rating very high in<BR>terms of quality within his entire catalog!There should be nothing keeping music fans away from this!

6305537321|5.0|Because of the fact that I'm only 17 years old, I just got around to watching this movie. I'd always heard about it but I never knew what it was about. And, to be quite honest, I didn't even think about watching it because I thought it was in black and white! (Eh, I didn't know when it was made!)<br />My dad made me watch it this past weekend and I fell in love with it! Unlike most romantic comedies made today, both main characters are broke. It doesn't follow the mold of:  poor/average girl falls for rich guy blah blah blah or the other way around. It was funny (Mickey Rooney's character was HILARIOUS!) and sad (when Holly finds out about Fred) and sappy (the last 20 minutes) all at the same time.<br />This movie is great for anyone, whether you saw it the first time around or you're a &quot;late viewer&quot; like me.
0345441184|5.0|I am, perhaps, somewhat biased about this book. I've read it, probably, at least a dozen times: let's put it this way, my hardcover copy is falling apart. Clearly I'm a fan, not just of Arthurian fiction but of Marion Zimmer Bradley as well.<br />A life-long enjoyment of Arthuriana will teach you one very clear thing: there is no definitive story or Arthur, and therefore all interpretations are as valid as the next. The existence of Arthur can barely be proven, and his identity is certainly up for debate. The stories of Camelot, the Round Table, and certainly of Lancelot and Guinevere are all Norman-French additions to a tale set hundreds of years prior in the Dark Ages. Arthur is an enduring legend but, as we know him, mostly a legend nonetheless.<br />Bradley's story, then, of the tale of Arthur through the women who knew him, is no less valid an interpretation than any of the rest, and certainly a unique one. Rich with its own legends and myths, &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; begins with Igraine, and goes forward through the eyes of Viviane, Morgaine, Morgause, and Gwenhwyfar, each with their own perspective on what truly were momentous times in the history of Britain. As Arthurian myth, it stands on its own two feet as well as any other, with its tales of war, love, religion, loyalty and betrayal spread across and repeated through several generations, closing with the end of an era and the beginning of Saxon rule over the island.<br />It is also, however, a tale of one human woman, Morgaine, and her life: her beginnings, her path, her faith, her love, her choices, her mistakes, and ultimately, her will to survive. The lesson of &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; that I take with me each time I read it is this: we are born to strive towards something, and in the struggle, we sometimes misstep along the way. It is our free will that gives us the ability to make mistakes, and also to accept them, later, as part of being human. It is, in many ways, the struggle that matters most, not the outcome.<br />This is the lesson of Morgaine's life, and it is what makes &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; a life-altering experience for me, and for many others who have read and taken it to their hearts.atters most, not the outcome.<br />This is the lesson of Morgaine's life, and it is what makes &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; a life-altering experience for me, and for many others who have read and taken it to their hearts.
B00008WG3U|5.0|Fat Mike has gotten a lot of flack latley because of his strong political views. But  punks roots are deeply embeded in politics and anti-establishment views. Most of the punk legends are really educated and have very strong political views for exapmle Jello Biafra, Ian Mcaye, Dwayne Peters, or even the guys of Pennywise.  In my book Fat Mike is a punk legend and a smart guy to boot, mix that with some good music and you have NOFX. Teenyboppers have made Fat Mike look like a bad guy for being too preachy. Well I say preach on. You gotta check this album out.
B00005YU1O|5.0|The real utility of this DVD - &quot;Waking Life&quot; - is that it is the ultimate &quot;how to&quot; book for any would be animator in this 21st century and a counting.<br />My comments arise from how I watched it - first without any of the special features, then I watched it with the text-feature, third I watched the movie under the animation and then I watched the special feature in which I watched the explanation by the director of how he had done things with the computer and why he had done so - or rather how he had managed to direct over twenty different animators and get it as seamless as he did - tips like taking the color from the movie instead of from the palette.  I suppose if one animator did the entire movie that would be less an issue.  As it is you may note that some of the other reviewers still note the movie is not seamless and no it is not but many of the methods that the director explains make it more so than would otherwise be so.<br />There is I suppose a message and medium issue - as for the message whether it is philosophy made simple or existentialism made simple to just concision is up to the viewer - If you view it 5x as I have you see how animation makes it work where the film does not - in the film there is too much information in how the speakers really look - each one could have been a movie in themselves and I can recommend the DVD to point new viewers to these ideas towards the real speakers - if you watch the film with the text on you can capture the names and hence go deeper - as it is - it is an astonishing concision of the meaning of lucid dreaming, cognitive science, existentialism and the big questions.  And as the animation holds it together you hear not one speaker but twenty.  And that is what makes it so extra-ordinary.  The director tells you how they do that.  I mean how they animate - it is amazing and an incredible act of kindness to share method.  Wow wow.
B0000027RL|5.0|Pearl Jam's storied debut is probably the first &quot;perfect&quot; album since, well...I don't when. The only other &quot;perfect&quot; record that comes to mind is The Beatles' &quot;Revolver&quot;...I'm sure other individuals could name additional potentially immaculate LP's, but rarely has such a confluence of critical and commercial acclaim been afforded an album before or since &quot;Ten&quot;'s release. Each track exudes glorious melody, songwriting, production value, and accessibility, without kowtowing to apparent influences and besmirching credibility. In turn, each track seemingly spawned (or compelled record companies to sign) three or four other bands, some of which were quite respectable, and others which wore out their welcome after one single. Many of these groups pop up even to this day, which is a testament to &quot;Ten&quot;'s long-term impact on the rock and roll landscape.<br />Pearl Jam was led by Eddie Vedder's screeching, howling vocals, unrivaled in both exertion, originality, and future influence, unless you throw Robert Plant in the mix. Behind him was the underrated guitar work of Mike McCready and Stone Gossard, the latter of which was a member of the first grunge band, Green River. Bassist Jeff Ament, also a former member of Green River, joined with drummer Dave Krusen to form a complimentary, but significantly dynamic, rhythm section to drive a sound that was equal parts 70's arena and 80's alt-indie, which previously had not been combined to such startling effect.<br />The end result was an album that helped destroy then-current conventions of rock and roll, led by glam-influenced, hair-metal artists, and create a relatively new sound and style which remain a fascinating characterization of the 90's pop culture aesthetic. Songs like &quot;Once,&quot; &quot;Why Go,&quot; and &quot;Deep&quot; indicated the rage of youth discontented with complacency, while &quot;Jeremy&quot; and &quot;Porch&quot; addressed pressing social issues withoutcandy-coating the truth. &quot;Oceans,&quot; &quot;Garden,&quot; and &quot;Release&quot; were charged ballads of sorts, kissing the listener whilst eliciting changes in perception. Aside from &quot;Jeremy,&quot; &quot;Even Flow,&quot; &quot;Alive,&quot; and &quot;Black&quot; were the album's biggest, most recognizable hits, telling stories of alienation and confusion alongside dark soundscapes of melody and instrumentation. In sum, each song was essential...each song meant something.<br />Currently, radio rock struggles within a mire of grunge and nu-metal imitators, mixed in with garage-rock revivalists who similarly wear their influences on their sleeves. For individuals looking for a band, or a record, to ignite their passion and touch their soul, Pearl Jam's &quot;Ten&quot; is for you.

6305128952|5.0|Okay, okay lets all agree on one thing here: the book is always better. that said, lets move on. &quot;The horse whisperer&quot; was a beautiful movie. It opens up with a young girl, Grace MacLaen. She lives in New York with her parents and her horse Pilgrim. One early morning her and a friend go out for a snow-filled trail ride. But where there is snow, there is ice and Grace's friend, Judith, slips (actually her horse, Gulliver, does)and they come crashing down into a fatal and life changing accident. After grace recovers enough to walk again, her mother realizes that something has changed within the young girl and forces her and pilgrim to take time out and seek help in montana. The &quot;horse whisperer&quot; tom booker (redford) sees that the threesome needs him in the worst way possible. Going against his belife in helping the horses, not the people, he sets out to help them. And so begins his long and demanding &quot;healing&quot; process. Pilgrim reaches a breakthrough and an old frienships is born again with the girl he once loved and trusted. But Grace's mother isnt ready to leave montana quite yet for she has fallen in love with the magical cowboy. All in all it was an excellent movie. but as i have said before the book is always better. watch the movie first and then &quot;feel&quot; (not see) what really happens when you read the book!

One of the first things that I noticed is that he does not use commas, quotes, or other punctuation other than periods.  His writing is plain and simple and totally believable.  <br />Frey describes the absolute hell of being a drunk who experiences blackouts, tremors and revolting sickness as his body recovers from the abuse of alcohol and drugs.  His description of the sickness that he experiences is vivid.    He has decimated his body to the point that he is told that he will die if he drinks or does drugs again.<BR>One of the early experiences he endures is having root canals done without any painkillers. He relates the excruciating pain along with the care and admiration of the driver who takes him to the dentist and the dentist himself.  <BR>He describes dreams in which he is doing drugs and drinking and he wakes us sick feeling as if he actually has done the drugs in his sleep.  A staff member at the rehab center tells him that it is a common occurrence of drug and alcohol abusers.<BR>  <BR>I would recommend this book to anyone who has a drug problem, knows someone who has a drug problem, or wants to understand addiction.
079284131X|1.0|It had been years since I'd seen this film (1988), and honestly, I don't recall what my exact impressions were then, although I do recall thinking that the antics of a murderous doll had some fright value to it.<br />What a difference a decade and a half makes.<br />After seeing a poster for Seed of Chucky, I decided to rent Child's Play again just for kicks. The ridiculousness of the 80s-style horror film was evident. The adults in this film, even one who made \\"detective\\", are either ignorant simpletons, or a hysterical woman. (This is as opposed to a strong woman who believes in her child. Nothing quite like perpetuating stereotypes.) <br />The \\"car chase\\" scene sums up the movies infantile nonsense quite well. Chris Sarandon's character (detective Mike Norris) is driving, and Chucky has snuck into the back seat. He first tries to choke Sarandon to death, but upon having his face burnt by a cigarette lighter that still happens to be burning hot although several minutes have passed since its last use, he gives up and resorts to trying to stab Norris through the seat. Here's a question: why not just take that knife, reach up to Norris's cranium (he was able to do so, as he was choking him earlier), and sever Norris's spinal cord? That would be too simple, and, of course, would ruin the rest of the story. Instead, Chucky tries to stab Norris through the back seat, and upon failing to miss such a large target (triangulating where Norris's back should be, based on the location of his head and shoulders, shouldn't be difficult), decides to crawl under the seat and start an attack against Norris's genitals. In the end, Chucky is foiled, and Norris escapes with his life.<br />A final word on the ending. It became a rule in the 80s that even when the killer was dead beyond all possible reckoning - even in relatively intelligent films like Die Hard - the killer came back for another go at things. This is no different, and should not give away the ending. I mean, it's 1988.Shouldn't Chucky fully recover from being burnt to toast, and then shot into tiny pieces? It only makes sense.
0345451325|5.0|Most cross-media tie-ins are disastrous--just look at all of the videogames based on movies that are absolutely horrible, or at the very least, completely disappointing.<br />Not so with Eric Nylund's Halo books.  The developers at Bungie did an amazing job on what could have been just another plotless shoot-em-up, showing creativity of design, atmosphere, and character, but they couldn't jam all the backstory into the opening of the game.  Nylund fills in the holes very deftly.  While there are elements of sci-fi pillars like Heinlein's Starship Troopers and Card's Ender's Game, Nylund still manages to craft nuance into the building-a-soldier formula.<br />While there are some annoying typos and continuity gaffes (two junior-grade lieutenants stand and salute a non-commissioned officer, for one) the books stand out from the cross-media dreck we're usually stuck with.  They are easily good enough to stand on their own without the game itself.<br />If you like Halo, order these immediately.<br />If you like military sci-fi, ditto.<br />If not, order them anyway.  You may just be surprised at what you find.
B0002I831S|5.0|FINALLY!! Refusing to buy almost 50 dvds with two episodes each, the trend of releasing tv series by seasons has come to The Original Star Trek! This is THE show that spawned everything after that became the huge franchise. It was all from this show in the 60s. I tried to watch the other spin offs and the movies but, nothing ever captured the chemistry and magic of this show! It all worked and the older I get, the more prophetic all the stories show themselves to be. Great packaging for these DVDs too!!!<BR>THANK YOU!!!

B0001GF2DS|4.0|Forget about the over rated John Wayne, this is what the Western is all about...man's greedy nature unleased in a savage land!  The italian actors are not always realistic,given the setting of the film, but the interplay between Eastwood and Wallach is astounding!  Watching these two weather beaten character's leathery faces made me want to beg for a glass of cool water!<br />The film has many comedic touches and has a feel of Odysseus wandering in America, with gold is the object of the qwest.  Fantastic setting and music, with relevant commentary about life that resonates even today.  It will send chills down your spine.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Change is good when it comes to slipknot.Just like marilyn manson they always change thier sound.Even though they are a little bit slower on this album it was still awesome!They still have that brutal edge they've always had but they also show thier softer side on this album.There was only 2 songs on here that I didn't like,which makes it the best album they have done so far.The ratings for the tracks are as follows: <br />prelude 3.0:4 stars,I usually skip it but is a good begining to the album<br />the blister exists:5 stars,amazing song with the same heavyness slipknot has always had.<br />three nil:4 stars,Great song with the same great heavyness.<br />duality:5 stars,loved it even though some maggots may not.<br />opium of the people:4 stars,nice heavy song.<br />circle:4 stars,I enjoy this song.they actualy use accoustic guitars in this one.<br />welcome:5 stars,Great heavy song.<br />vermillion:2 stars,good begining but starts to get dumb towards the middle.<br />pulse of the maggots:5 stars,awesome song<br />before I forget:4 stars,a great song<br />vermillion pt.2:5 stars, loved it.A much better improvment over the first.It also uses accoustic guitars.<br />the nameless:3 stars,I only kind of like this song.At first it was heavy then the corus was a slow accoustic melody.those two elements can't mix well in one song.<br />the virus of life:0 stars,hate it, a typically dumb slow song by slipknot.It reminds me of scissors which I hate.<br />danger keep away:4 stars, good ending<br />overall:4 1/2<br /> I would have gave it 5 stars if it hadn't have been for vermillion and the virus of life.If you like slipknots old stuff just expect a change when you get this one.If you want to here slipknot for the first time I suggest there debut self titled album.<br />                 P.S.(there is hardly any cusing in this album,corey didn't even say the F word once.)
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|Dave, Jimmy and Sean spend a pretty normal childhood in a Boston neighborhood. One day though, everything changes: Dave is abducted and sexually abused by two men who pretend to be policemen. Though he can escape after a few days of torture and returns home safe, his life will never be the same from this day on, and the lives of the three boys go into different directions. <BR>25 years later, a tragic event brings the former friends together. Jimmys (Sean Penn) 19-year-old daughter is brutally murdered. Sean (Kevin Bacon), meanwhile working for the state-police, promises his old buddy to find the murderer of the young woman. Soon Dave (Tim Robbins) becomes the main suspect...<BR>\\"Mystic River\\" is really a brilliant movie (based on a great novel by Dennis Lehane, which is - even after having watched the movie - worth reading)...and definitely on of the best with Clint Eastwood as a director. This movie is a good example that it is still possible to make a great movie without expensive visual effects and computer-generated action sequences. Its just the right mixture of a great plot (it closes the gap between a thriller and a psychological drama), a perfect score, extremely good directing and outstanding performances from the ensemble, which is one of the best that Hollywood has seen in the last decade. <BR>Sean Penn is probably playing the best role of his career and Tim Robbins is outstanding as the broken man who is still suffering from his childhood. Both actors got Academy Awards for their performances. Nevertheless, the rest of the great cast is doing a very good job too...Kevin Bacon, Laura Linney, Marcia Gay Harden, Laurence Fishburne and many actors in supporting roles contribute to the best movie of the year 2003.<BR>You definitely need to watch this one...its dark, encouraging, sad, exciting, brutally realistic and simply brilliant!
B00006RU5B|3.0|The three hits from this album, &quot;Cochise&quot;, &quot;Like a Stone&quot; and &quot;I am the Highway&quot; are all good, but not great.  Chris Cornell's voice has clearly gotten better since Soundgarden, but he doesn't do his signature yell nearly enough.  The instrumentals just seem lazy to me, and don't live up to Rage standards.  Also the eleven other songs seem to be trying to imitate one of the three songs I have listed already.<BR>I give the CD three stars because it still is quality rock music, and sadly better than 95% of the other Rock music out there today.
B00008S2VG|2.0|I can't imagine any singer allowing lyrics like &quot;I'm having a soy latte, double shotte,&quot;among a number of other misguided poorly written songs, to be part of their record. It's not only ridiculous, it talks down to the listener. Unless you're maybe 4 years of age, this is an insult to a record buyer's intelligence:))
B0001611DI|1.0|Yet again, another zombie flick I considered OUTRAGEOUSLY overrated. The two others I'd seen were &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; and &quot;Dead Alive&quot;, two films, like this, I thought were very boring, and asked myself &quot;what's the big deal?&quot; all throught. Atleast &quot;Dead Alive&quot; was more of a horror film than this and &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;. &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;, somewhat like &quot;Dead Alive&quot;, is very much an action film. Actually, im not sure you could even call that, becuase nothing really happens thorought the whole thing. The un-likeable charectors steal some stuff from the stores, and shoot zombies. It also has annoying comedy that takes away the any possible fear you could get from it. Theres barely any charector development, tho theres plenty of time for it. &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; is also one of those annoying know-it-all films that are sopposued to saterize on the way people live. Maybe the writer was so foucused on this aspect, that he forget to fill in any scares? To me, this was a complete waste of two hours. I definetely don't reccomend this, unless you have to see every popular movie ever made.

0380807343|3.0|Neil Gaiman's, \\"Coraline,\\" is a dark, moody short novel (160 pages or so) intended for a pre-teen audience that can also be enjoyed by adults as well.  Gaiman succeeds in giving his readers a John Bellairs (\\"The House With a Clock In It's Walls, etc.) type reading experience with a story filled with eerie atmosphere and creepy supernatural beings.  Fans of Gaiman's work in the medium of comic books will also appreciate the remarkable black & white illustrations provided by Dave McKean in each chapter.  My only nit-pick is that while I was appreciating McKean's artwork along with Gaiman's excellent storyline and characters one can't help but think that perhaps this story would've been better suited as a one-shot graphic novel.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I am hearing people such as Beth and some other guy saying this sucks because this is on MTV.Just because it is played on MTV doesnot mean it is bad.This is real rap folks in everyway.I listen to all Hip Hop and this is pricess and no I am not lying.<BR>Yes Rakim is awesome but at the same time you buy Paid in Full you should also buy some Kanye West.Plus the line from Jesus Walks&quot;The way Kathy Lee needs Regis I need Jesus&quot;is probally the Lyric of the year.All three singles on this album have been fire.Yes the dude does not Flow good but he has done okay on ocation.He would get a 9 out of 10 on Lyrics.Jesus Walks is a terrible video but a awesome song one the 3 hot Mainstream rap<BR>singles out with 99 Problems by Jay Z and Slow Motion by Juvenile.I am sure when I go to underground hip hop.com I will find some great songs to but the fact is this album is Hot.<BR>Those people do not know what there talking about-<BR>Lyrics 9/10 Production 10/10 X Factor 10/10 Classic 10/10 Me 10<BR>Overall 49/50-98% This album gets 5 Mics
B00003CXCT|5.0|first of all... i want the originals that i loved so dearly, but in all reality... i'll take what i can get. sure, some things tweaked are better left untweaked. george can do what he wants. more power to him. those of you clinging to the fabric of the original movies need to get a life! it's star wars on friggin' dvd! so...... with that, i'll get my copy when it comes out and enjoy it. it will probably be an all \\"ewoks gone wild\\" version of jedi, but at least it will be a clear picture with great sound! be happy with what you get. we couldn't be getting anything at all.
B0001EFTVA|5.0|This is what a masterpiece is al bout. Action, drama, comedy, and adventure. The 4 main elements of a movie and wow is it done well!!!!<br />The characters are the most realistic in  any anime I have seen. I love how when the youngest is worried bout the other 2 bumbs and when she is relieved they are ok she saysuncle bag or geezer. But my personal favorite is the trans. I recommend this movie to every1. Also by the way this movie takes place on Christmas. So watch it wit the family on Christmas eve or somethin. It is everything!
B000002H97|5.0|I've looked at some of the reviews for this album and, being a rocker and hardcore Metallica fan, am quite apalled at some of the very derogatory things people had to say about Metallica and The Black Album.<br />Yes, it definately sounds different than Ride the Lightning in that it has a more laid back sound to it. And yes, the sound of the music might have indicated that they were starting to conform to the money part of the music industry instead of &quot;playing for the fans,&quot; as was their belief in the days of Ride the Lightning and Kill 'Em All. But sound isn't the only aspect to look at. There are lyrics there as well.<br />The lyrics of every song on this album deserve close attention. Maybe if some of the reviewers actually thought about what the lyrics meant, they might appreciate the songs more. &quot;Forever trust in who you are, and nothing else matters&quot; sounds like pretty deep lyrics coming from the band that I've seen some call &quot;blockheaded.&quot; Many of the songs, including Sad But True and The Struggle Within, depict an inner stuggle and show that sometimes you can't even trust yourself....and that life's not always fair. <br />The lyrics not making sense? Is it really that difficult to see that Enter Sandman is, on the surface, about putting a child who fears monsters to sleep? It's about fear, something that everyone has. The proverbial &quot;beasts under your bed.&quot; Not to mention that Don't Tread On Me could be interpreted as one of the most patriotic metal songs out there. &quot;Liberty or death, what we so proudly hail, once you provoke her, rattling of her tail, never begins it, never but once engaged, never surrender, showing the fangs of rage. Don't tread on me. So be it, threaten no more. To secure peace is to prepare for war.&quot; Both the lyrics and the sound of Don't Tread On Me send a &quot;mess with me and you won't live to see another day&quot; attitude, much like that of the United States.<br />As for the cover,at first glance, it may appear all black, but if you take more than a glance at it, you'll see that the top left corner sports &quot;Metallica&quot; and the bottom right corner sports a coiled snake similar to the one on the Gadsden Flag of the Union during the Civil War, which happens to also bear the line &quot;Don't Tread On Me.&quot;<br />On a final note, Metallica seems to have already taken care of themselves against those that choose to attack them and their music: &quot;No more, the crap rolls out your mouth again....Before you judge me take a look at you. Can't you find something better to do? Point that finger, slow to understand, arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand....Judge not, lest ye be judged yourself.&quot; Basically, it's them that work their tails off to make it big, they've done so from the beginning. It's no easy task to come out with widely different material such as they have. And until I see those who write the really negative reviews put a band together, write music that lasts over a decade, keep the band together with at least half of the original members for over 20 years, and can generally do any better than Metallica, I think they need to grow up and enjoy the album for its good parts, not attack it for parts they don't like just because it's not like Metallica's older works. Besides, don't most people complain when a band's CD sounds like the previous one?
B00000DFRS|3.0|I wasn't a fan of her first two albums, but I Really think \\"I'm Your Baby Tonight\\" was her best album.  The title track is kind of weak lyrically. I know Wyclef Jean has written better songs. The DarkChild songs on here are basically rehashes of other hits (\\"If I Told You That\\" is the equivelant of \\"If you had my love\\").  \\"I Learned From The Best\\" sounds almost exactly like \\"Too Gone Too Long\\" by En Vogue. The tracks produced by Missy Elliot aren't worth writing home about either (\\"Things You Say\\" from \\" Just Whitney\\" is a LOT better than the ones here).  There ARE highlights however, such as the duet with Mariah Carey from \\"The Prince of Egypt\\" \\"When You Believe.\\"  I also enjoy the Babyface written/produced \\"Until You Come Back\\" as well as \\"I Bow Out\\" and the concluding \\"I Was Made To Love Him.\\" Otherwise this album falls flat of b een-there-done-that throaway tracks from other albums. There are the highlights as I said earlier but overall I'd say \\"I'm Your B aby Tonight\\" and \\"Just Whitney\\" are her best albums hands down! It just didn't seem like she tried too hard on this and let Clive Davis do all the work. Not reccomended.
B000002NHN|5.0|I recommend Loreena's music to anyone who is stressed out. It is one of the most relaxing CDs that I have ever purchased. It sort takes you to a state of tranquility and focus. I know you will love it if you hear it.
0553582445|5.0|Every so often I read a book that draws me in so completely that I take time out of my day and stay up late at night just to read it. Such was the case with Fool's Errand. Robin Hobb is a wonderful writer-There is nothing with which I can find fault about this book. Even the fact that this book follows a prior trilogy doesn't give me a feeling like I'm missing anything as a new reader. Hobb provides established facts steadily over the course of the novel without being overbearing or condescending. I will certainly pick up the subsequent novels and look out for her earlier books as well.
B0001MDP3G|2.0|This movie was very long and very depressing.  I think I cried for half of the movie.  It seemed to be billed as a Civil War movie but, it was less like a Civil War movie than Gone with the Wind.  This movie was a love story and a very tortured one at that.  Do yourself a favor and don't watch it!
B00006879E|4.0|I purchased this album several months ago based on the strength of This Love.  I listen to it, maybe once or twice a month since then, which is less than I had anticipated.  However, I have no idea who to compare this group with, which says volumes on how unique I think they are in the current pop/rock landscape.  They are by no means an indie rock group that makes you feel like you've heard an as yet undiscovered find.  They are pop.  But that's cool.  I like pop.<br />For me the strength of Maroon 5 is that you can actually kind of dance to their tracks, which I find uncommon in most of the stuff by bands that you hear on the radio.  But &quot;This Love&quot; always makes me want to dance around my living room.  Likewise for &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot;.  The songs largely seem to be about  unavailable women, a perfectly good topic, particularly when you're fusing old school Rhythm and Blues with modern rock (Listen to &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; for an example not currently on the radio).  I'd recommend this to anyone whose tastes run mainstream.
0743243307|1.0|Very poorly written....badly needed an editor.  Story could have been interesting but I could not finish the book.
B000002TWN|5.0|Next to R.kelly, D'Angelo is the 2nd best R&amp;B artist out there. Everyone knows the classic Slow Jam, &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; though including some not as popular hits, like &quot;Lady&quot; The songs on this album may not be a popular as his hit &quot;Untitled (How Does It Feel) But in my opinion, it is diffinetly better. Pick this album up, you won't regret it!
B000001ESN|5.0|I got the PERMANENT WAVES album on cassette some years ago from my brother-in-law but it got messed up in my mom's tape deck. I finally bought it on CD today rather than their new album and have really enjoyed it. <BR>   Ofcourse, I already knew &quot;Spirit of Radio&quot; and &quot;Freewill&quot; since they are just overplayed on my local classic rock station but I still like them. Wheather you're religious or not, if you're familiar with the Bible you'll find &quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot; to be very eerie. &quot;Entre Nous&quot;(if someone would tell me what language that is and what it means I would appreciate it) shows that love songs aren't exactly Rush's strong suite, Neil Peart even said in an interview once that he wasn't into writing love songs. &quot;Different Strings&quot; is a semi-acoustic song about how different people see things in you guessed it different ways. Ok now for the finale &quot;Natural Science&quot;, this would be their second to last really long song I believe. Second to &quot;The Camera Eye&quot; on the next album. The song has three parts the first is Tidal Pools, the second hyperspace, and the third Permanent Waves. <BR>   At this point in their musical career Rush could still rock, have long and short songs, and use the synth without drowning out Alex Lifeson's guitar. Aside from the compilations, as an album this would definitely be a good introduction to Rush. I highly recommend this to anyone who is curious about Rush's music.
B00000099Y|5.0|i was reading reviews and one fo you said somthing about comparing this cd to system of a down in terms of quality? system of a down? you have to be kidding me. the music on that cd is totally insane and pointless and the lead singer sounds like bin laden with a hernia. just no talent. tool on the other hand has more talent then ive seen in alot of other bands. theres just so much complexity to the music they write. I dont kno if you play an instrument but if you try to play some of thier songs they are pretty fricken tough. as opposed to system of a down or somthing that takes me 5 mins to learn the entire song.
0671027573|3.0|The romance between Sam and Jaine was cute. Starting out as neighbors hating each other and then turning into something more. I liked the quarters Jaine had to give people if she said a curse word. Most people know how hard it is to stop cursing even if you only say it in your mind and then you just get used to saying it. <br />Of course some of the words Howard used was pretty juvenile. I didn't know whether to laugh or not when Howard put the words &quot;sticky-out part.&quot; The mystery part was though. Some books you get the first time reading it through. This one you don't. I am really going to have to follow the killer when I read this again because it was really crazy. I didn't know who the killer was until Howard actually spelled it out.<br />As far as the &quot;List&quot; goes though, that plot was pretty unrealistic. How many times have women made lists about the perfect guy? Then they become celebrities because of this? Appearing on many talk shows and even ABC, I don't think so. So if you have a hard time reading a book that isn't realistic, this isn't the book for you. I was getting a bit annoyed too but the rest of the book is really good.<br />Because the characters died so soon too, they were really only surface revealed. Then I was annoyed that the author killed off the women who made up with their boyfriends/husbands. Since the characters except for Jaine and Sam were flat, I didn't really care too much when they died anyway. Mostly I just said awww oh well to myself. But it was nice to see how the four girlfriends chatted and reminded me of my clique of girls.
B0001ENYKS|1.0|Franz Ferdinand is without a doubt one of the most horrendous discs to pelt my eardrums in years. What makes it worse is the fact that outlets such as MTV are touting them as, for example, \\"Buzzworthy\\". The problem with such practices is that it seems every band to emerge in the past two or three years which doesn't sound like Creed is labeled this way. <br />Bands such as The Strokes or The White Stripes aren't doing anything for music other than sounding different from Blink 182 and Britney Spears. They're not necessarily good bands. They're only different from the other crap that we've been abused with in recent years. The music industry is in a funk and we're being punished because of it with bands such as Franz Ferdinand. <br />On the other hand, Franz Ferdinand's music isn't THAT bad. It just sounded a lot better in 1983 when it was something new and performed by Duran Duran.
0385334206|5.0|Although this novel was at times childish, shocking, humorous, and perhaps even a bit disturbing, I think Vonnegut effectively conveyed his feelings concerning the more peculiar social fixations and oddities that are prevalent in our time. However, what moved me most out of all of Vonnegut's blatant strikes were his remarks concerning the value of characters in literature. Of course, almost anybody reading this book can pick out a few characters who they consider to be &quot;main&quot; or key characters consistently throughout the novel, but Vonnegut raises the question of the equality of characters in a novel. While Vonnegut was not completely successful in blurring the status of the main characters in his novel, I felt like his attempt at creating his supporting characters as equals was well done and I commend him for it. I'm sure Vonnegut realizes that a story in which all characters are equal in detail/depth/development would destroy the staggered levels of complexity that make literature so fascinating, but raising the question in really caused me to stop and think. Vonnegut's illustrations prove why he's a writer rather than an artist, but I guess I appreciate how the drawings made the pages go by more quickly.

B00003CXCT|1.0|Poor fans - we wait years to own the original trilogy on DVD. Bad enough that smug-face George's prequells are horrifying - poop and fart jokes seem to be his medium today, with a dose of the crappiest cast imaginable. Now, the trilogy comes out in September and the box set does not include the original films? Why?<BR>Ok, George - you own the films. You can make all the changes you want to meet your original vision. I accept, but not agree. You are tugging on the heartstrings of a generation who freeked out over the Wizard of Oz-of-our-time. We lined up multiple times to see the incredible first movie. We remember who pulled the trigger first in the canteena. We did not need cutesy characters to be wowed - we had Darth Vader.<BR>You could have let us re-live those great memories. Shame - now we have to see you add tacky mag wheels and traction bars to a perfect machine, because it's what you wanted all along. Fine, but why not give it too us both ways?<BR>And, to those who can only sputter cliches like \\"get a life\\" I say: I have one today, and I had one yesterday. I happen to enjoy revisiting yesterdays life during moments of nostalgia, so I am within reason when I complain about it being tampered with.<BR>What to do, what to do. I might buy this, and I might not. It seems like the worst people these days are named George, don't you think?
B00005JMUA|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies...It was great. I can't wait to get it. A lot of people have seen the first one when it came out on DVD but it was too late to help the amount of money made for the second one. If everyone knew how good the Kill Bill Series is, I think that more people would have seen it. I think that any movie lover over the age of 14/15 should see it. Great Movie!
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Scarface is one of the greatest films of all time.  It has memorable scenes, memorable characters, memorable quotes, and memorable shootouts.  Pachino is great and so is the actor who plays Manollo.  They have great chemistry and it's so tragic their friendship ends how it does.  Rappers relate to Scarface so much because he's just like most of them.  He came from nothing and in the end the world was his.  The villains(if you can separate every character) were very believable.  Frank Lopez is about as memorable as Tony himself, as is Mr. Sosa.  Scarface has something for everyone.  Romance, Action, Drama, Comedy, and Shoot-em-up.  This is probably DePalma's best and the DVD is really cool.  The point is Scarface is a classic and Al Pachino is/was the Marlon Brando of our generation.
0156027321|5.0|This is one of those books that, upon closing the back cover, I was holding it close and wondering: &quot;Just want am I going to read now?!&quot; I found that I read it in fits and starts so that it wouldn't be finished too soon. Though, I couldn't stop thinking about Pi as the days passed...wondering what he and Richard Parker (the very large tiger with whom he's stranded on that life boat) were facing. At the end of it all, I found myself wondering just how a guy can write a book so full of wonder. I found myself exploring the possibility that Richard Parker might be Pi's fear...a fear so great that he had to keep it placated in so many ways as he struggled to survive. This is a great book!!!
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I just bought the DVD and saw the movie for the first time...and i thought it was freakin AWESOME. Seeing as how Ashton Kutcher is totally opposite as his alter ego Michael Kelso...it made the movie even more interesting! Good Job Ashton!
B0000524E5|2.0|When Coyote Ugly was released four years ago, most reviewers said the movie was &quot;more than chicks dancing on a bar&quot;. After seeing it, I agree. This movie is so predictible. Get a young, motivated, talented [but slightly immature] young girl out of Small Town, USA to Big City, USA to pursue her dream. Have her then hone her craft for various companies and getting rejected time and time again. Have her end up in a lonely diner with only a few dollars to her name. To remendy her cash problem, she gets a job at a sleazy bar. Over time, the bar overtakes her life, and she loses her boyfriend and dad in the process. In a realignment of priorties, she walks out of the bar, and refocuses on her dream. In the end she makes it.<br />That my friends, is the plot of this movie. For most people (myself included) this movie is a totally futile effort, topped by a totally annoying performance by Piper Perabo. The only people who might like this film are teens and twenty-somethings and those needing a little something to watch in the middle of the night (again, like myself).
B0001MDP3G|2.0|It was good up to a point...but then it just went on and on and on and got to be pretentious and all-suffering, in the same way that &quot;The English Patient Was.&quot; DIE ALREADY, Elaine called out from the audience in that &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode. And by the way, for a southern Civil War epic...where were all the black people?  One more note to filmmakers:  you do not need to keep Nicole Kidman in full makeup and perfectly styled hair when she is supposedly starving.
B0001IN0DA|4.0|Calling this the greatest Wrestlemania ever is going overboard, I think III, X, and X-Seven will put this one in it's place. However, this was waaaaay better than X-8 and a boatload better than XIX.<br />The Good<br /> The World Heavyweight Title Match was awesome. Triple H, HBK, and Benoit really tore it up, and Benoit coming out on top was the icing on the cake. This one here is on my top ten list of greatest Wrestlemania matches of all time, but falls short of Savage-Steamboat, HBK-Hall Ladder Match, Bret vs. Owen, & Bret vs. Stone Cold.<br /> The WWE title match between Eddie Guerrero and Kurt Angle was stellar, and the psychology between them was neat. Eddie outsmarting Angle in the end was pure genius.<br /> Rock & Foley vs. Evolution was very entertaining, especially the exchanges between Rock and Flair. Orton and Batista held their own, but Foley shined the most here. Great match.<br /> Christian vs. Chris Jericho had a solid outing, would of been better if this match opened the show. The Trish heel turn in the end wasn't too shocking to me, but it seemed to get a nice reaction from the crowd.<br /> Good WM tribute to the recently inducted WWE Hall of Famers. Funny skit with Coach, Mean Gene/Bobby the Brain, and Moolah/Mae Young. I liked the mini interview with Jesse Ventura and Donald Trump.<br />In the Middle<br /> Nice stuff in the Cruiserweight Open, but the match was waaaaay too short for me.<br /> The World Tag Team Title Match was rushed, and the team of Jindrak and Cade had no reason being there, but nice effort by Booker/RVD, the Dudley's, and Dupree/Conway.<br /> The Women's Title Match was too short and a let down. Molly and Victoria are two of the best workers in the Women's Division (Jazz and Trish are the other two.). Got more depressing as beautifal Molly was shaved bald.<br />The Bad<br /> But it's alright to give a decent amount of match time for the Playboy Evening Gown match. Short of nothing we've already seen before a billion times before.<br /> I was siked to see Taker return to the Deadman gimmick, not as siked to see the same old Taker-Kane match.<br />WWE Tag team Title Match was a total mess.<br />Cena vs. The Big Show, only thing good here was cena taking the US title, match was bad all around.<br />Brock vs. Goldberg bombed big time. Worst Match of the Year so far. Unsympathetic crowd and Austin stunning both guys afterwards made up for such a pathetic match.<br />Your skip button will be busy, but hey you got at least four good matches worth seeing.<br />The extra's. Your usual WM pre and post comments, plus a Heat match between Venis/Storm vs. The Dudley Boyz, that was way better than all the matches I listed being bad and mediocre. The third disc is the gem here. You get to play WM Trivia, with responses to correct and wrong answers by All three Dudley Boyz, Victoria, Rhyno, Kurt Angle, Mick Foley, and Al Snow. Foley and Snow's responses are hilarious. If you missed the Spike-TV special Wrestlemania's Ten Greatest Matches, it's on the third disc as well, along with Wrestlemania the Movie bits featuring, Rock,Austin, Taker, HBK, Brock, and Angle. The deleted scenes are there two, featuring Booker, Triple H, Vince , and Hogan, plus a ehind the scenes look as Jesse Ventura does the voice overs for the movie. Neat stuff.<br />Great DVD to have for your collection all around, now looking forward to Wrestlemania 21 in the City of the Angels!ore.<br /> I was siked to see Taker return to the Deadman gimmick, not as siked to see the same old Taker-Kane match.<br />WWE Tag team Title Match was a total mess.<br />Cena vs. The Big Show, only thing good here was cena taking the US title, match was bad all around.<br />Brock vs. Goldberg bombed big time.

B0002858YS|4.0|Good album for fans of the Strokes or 80's new wave.  All the songs are well written and make interesting use of guitar and keyboards.  Some songs sound too much like the Strokes but this is one album that will be in my player all summer long.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|Much, much, MUCH better than &quot;Songs In A Minor&quot;, which, in my opinion, was just awful. The only good tracks from 'A Minor' were the released singles. But &quot;The Diary Of Alicia Keys&quot; makes up for past mistakes, big time.<br />From start to finish, 'Diary' works on a variety of levels. From head bobbing tracks such as &quot;Dragon Days&quot;, &quot;So Simple&quot;, and &quot;Karma&quot; (to the clueless person that gave Alicia a bad review and claimed to not know what karma means has very little to no credibility and should be scrolled past with the quickness. Besides, he/she claimed Ashanti was better. Oookay...) to smooth tracks like &quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot;, &quot;Diary&quot; and &quot;Slow Down&quot; makes this album a sure hit. Toss in a few slow tracks (&quot;If I Ain't Got You&quot;, &quot;Wake Up&quot; and When You Really Love Someone&quot;) and there you have it: a much deserved award winning album.
B00000DRXM|5.0|When I first heard about Ozzy Osbourne when I was 13 years old back in 1980, I was told by a sort-of friend who hated him so vociferously that to me at the time, Ozzy sounded like a real no-talent slimeball. I knew nothing of Ozzy's seminal influence as the original lead singer of Black Sabbath; in fact, I didn't even *know* Black Sabbath for anything other than their demonic-sounding name! I wasn't even into heavy Metal at all back then. I certainly knew nothing of Ozzy's talent or influence on heavy rock. Then, later that year, I first heard \\"Crazy Train\\" and I was stunned: *This* was the same guy who likes to pee on things, inlcuding the Alamo, and bites the heads off birds??<br />Of course, I became fascinated with Ozzy in part because of his contradictory aspects. I fell in love with \\"Crazy Train\\" and as soon as I first heard \\"I Don't Know\\" a couple of years later, I had to FINALLY go out & get the album. I purchased BLIZZARD OF OZZ (1980) on vinyl---of course---in 1983. I purchased the 1995 remaster on CD just a couple of years ago. As influential an album as this was back then, we really take for granted the fact that, when Ozzy assembled himself on lead vocals, Randy Rhoads on lead guitar, Don Airey on keyboards, Bob Daisley on bass guitar and Lee Kerslake on drums, Ozzy was operating heavily on a wing and a prayer---and on heavily controlled substances. His attempt at a comeback after being dismissed from Black Sabbath for good after their so-so NEVER SAY DIE! (1978) album was almost not to be.<br />As I and many others have learned in the past few years, thanks to Ozzy's candor on VH1, Ozzy was down & out in 1978 when he met Sharon Arden, the daughter of a record company exec who had given up on Ozzy as a drugged-out has-been. Sharon saw something special in him. Soon, they became romantically involved, then married. She tried to shop BLIZZARD OF OZZ around to everybody, and was soundly rejected over & over again---until a growing division of Columbia, JetRecords, decided to give him a shot. (Of course, it was at the release party for the record that Ozzy got drunk and bit the head off a dove that had been released as a sign of goodwill!) Ozzy waded through his newfound infamy while many people---like me---became awed by his music.<br />After all, what's not to love about his music? On Black Sabbath's NEVER SAY DIE, Ozzy and his soon-to-be-former bandmates sounded rather disjointed & tired. Just as Sabbath became re-energized by the arrival of Ronnie James Dio (culiminating in their own great 1980 album HEAVEN AND HELL), Ozzy became re-energized as well. Working with great British Metal veterans Daisley & Kerslake, and especially with young up-and-coming Californian guitar virtuoso, Randy Rhoads, Ozzy finally re-found his musical inspiration. Ozzy's sound was now very modern and very American. Even with his penchant for drugs and drink, his high tenor voice was in great form. The great, fast-riffing, heart-pumping opening song \\"I Don't Know\\" became an anthem for disaffected youth, and the equally-driving \\"Crazy Train\\" became the most popular Heavy Metal song of 1980, directly causing a huge resurgence in the popularity of heavy Metal, which in the wake of Disco in the late '70's had been dismissed as \\"dead music.\\" Talk about rebirth!!<br />Thanks to this rebirth, I became a huge fan of the music that ended up informing my high school years. I appreciated the melody that went along with the heaviness of the music. All of Ozzy's songs on this album are melodic, and not all of them are heavy. Witness \\"Goodbye To Romance,\\" a non-heavy, acoustic ballad that shows Ozzy did have a heart, after all! Randy Rhoads' light, acoustic instrumental \\"Dee\\" also shows that metallers are not just about \\"noise.\\" Then, we have the song which actually took four years to become controversial, the unfairly-maligned \\"Suicide Solution.\\" Let me tell you something about my experience listening to this song: No, I didn't take drugs, I didn't drink, I didn't worhip Satan and this song certainly didn't make me want to kill myself. Enough said. :)<br />\\"Mr. Crowley\\" has a great keyboard intro courtesy of Don Airey, again showing that guitar isn't the *only* instrument used in Heavy Metal. The last three songs never really made much of an impression on me, but that's probably because I played the other songs hundreds of times each! Maybe one of these days, I will revisit \\"No Bone Movies,\\" \\"Revelation (Mother Earth)\\" and \\"Steal Away (The Night).\\" Even just on the basis of the first five classic 80's tunes alone, Ozzy Osbourne fully deserved his comeback all the way, and BLIZZARD OF OZZ became his first of many multi-Platinum albums which all shared incredibly smooth production values, great blazing guitar riffs and melodic singing by Ozzy, who never gave himself enough credit for his unique voice. This is still one of the all-time greatest rock albums of the 1980's.<br />MOST RECOMMENDED
6305313687|5.0|this movie is the most amasing movie ive seen. there is no other movie like it. This movie shows how anyone can change and that u shouldnt judge people by there race. i could watch this movie over and over again. this movie is remarkable. its sad its mean its basicly everything a movie can be. i think this is edward nortons greatest movie and the same with edwark furlong. i think that everyone should watch this movie no matter what ages. even if it is graphic anyone can learn from this movie.
B000089RVX|1.0|This album is pure trash.  This is why.  I saw this band live at the hard rock cafe in Vegas last year, you might have seen it on TV.  This is the worst concert I have ever been to in my life.  First off, Amy Lee cannot sing at all, it is a fact, she sounded flatter than the chest of a 10 year old girl.  On bring me to life, oh my god it was too funny, because Paul McCoy from 12 Stones wasnt there obvious, they had their guitarist &quot;sing&quot; that part, he flat out screamed it like at the top of his lungs I was crying laughing.  But honestly unless you are looking for a goth avril lavigne I strongly suggest not buying this album.
B00003RQNJ|5.0|Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is one of the best movies (if not the best!!!) I have ever seen.  The action, the interplay and the chemistry between the 2 leading stars (Newman, Redford) is like &quot;poetry in motion&quot;.  The action is non-stop, as well as the comedy, especially of Newman.  Even though there is quite a bit of violence throughout the movie, I would recommend that everyone buy the video!!!
B000000H3W|5.0|Arise is the best Sepultura album ever...If you don't know what is Sepultura, by this cd...<br />SEPULTURA É METAL!!!ROCK N' ROLL FAZ BEM A SAÚDE!!!<br />God Bless Igor Cavalera(The best drummer ever)
B00004YYDI|5.0|There's hardly anything I can say that will do justice to the splendor of 'Leon - The Professional'. The insanity of both the action sequences and Gary Oldman's performance... the touching love story of 2 lonely outcasts... the fantastic cinematography... the heart-breaking tragedy... the pulsing score... the violent life of a shy, milk-drinking, plant-loving hitman... the soul of an innocent little girl... the blistering, chaotic, blood-drenched fury that lives in all 3 of these characters...<br />...Wow...<br />...It's just a vortex of beautiful destruction. All these things crammed into one amazing film. A remarkable cast giving remarkable performances, and a very visual director shoving this seething powerhouse of a film right in our faces...<br />Like I said, there's nothing I can say. So, just believe me when I tell you that this is a very great film.
B000000H4V|5.0|Buy this cd, please...For me...The best Sepultura album...<BR>I have a band: &quot;Bloody Roots&quot;. We are 3 brazilians guys playing Metal in Arizona...We played with Sepultura in '99 in So Paulo, Brasil. We played with Deftones in 2001 after the Rock in Rio. If you want to listen some metal, we are living in Phoenix.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|really enjoyable slice of life. Great performances, great visual flare, amazing culture shock. SHouldve got more oscars than it did. Forget the naysayers. Get the film, dim the lights, grab a brewski, pop it in and enjoy.
B0000AI45P|5.0|Giving this ecstatic music anything less than 5 stars is an impertinence. Marquee Moon is up there with Astral Weeks and Forever Changes as one of the Untouchables of contemporary music.<BR>I saw the band last week at the Academy here in Manchester (supporting a radiant, storming Patti Smith) and they were awesome. To hear Prove It - that descending guitar riff! - live was a highlight of my year. Tom Verlaine was and remains a hero (seek out his great albums Words From the Front and the wonderful The Wonder, for example). This is sparkling fresh, scintillating rock that transcends genres and labels.
0812550757|5.0|Card does not go the traditional route with sequels to books as many authors have done in the past. Speaker For The Dead is meant to be a standalone book , which means you do not have to have read Ender's Game to understand what goes on in the book. However, Speaker For The Dead is a sequel in the sense that some of the background is needed from Ender's Game or Ender's Shadow to get fully what the book is talking about when it refers to Ender the Xenocide and Peter the Hegemon, and so forth. However, reading Ender's Game is not critical to the actual story itself. Speaker for the Dead follows the raveged with guilt Ender Wiggin to the world of Trondheim. Ender and Valetine are currently stationed after their choice to not return to Earth where Ender could be used as a pawn for warring nations. Ender is a teacher at a local university as is Valentine. However, Ender get's a call to go to the distant world of Luisitania to speak the death of Marcao, the husband of one of the central characters in the novel (Novinha). Still looking for that one world where the bugger hive queen may finally be hatched again to thrive and live in peace among the human worlds, Ender  takes the call to become Lusitania's Speaker of the Dead. This novel will not disappoint any readers that were fans from the first book. The novel is a bit more mature as Ender thanks to space travel is in his mid-30's (which is more around the figure of 3,000 years). Also laced with interesting philosophical arguments (though not buried with them as Xenocide was) and a mature but yet fascinating storyline, Speaker for the Dead is a good read for any fan of the Ender's Series.
B000002B49|5.0|What a fascinating and spine-tingling interpretation and enhancement of Eastern European music, primarily Hungarian, which is my heritage. Deep Forest manages to make Marta Sebestyen sound even more evocative than she usually sounds ... her voice is soulful, poignant, piercingly tender and sincere. This CD is one nonstop experience of primarily Hungarian/Gypsy and Eastern European culture. It is made more enticing and alluring by the qualities Deep Forest brings forth with their creative imaginations -- they add unique beats and splendid vocalizations. They start with an original piece of music by the original artist, then intepret and expand the sound into haunting and ethereal dimensions. I can not say which is my favorite because the whole CD is one magnificent production of high quality and artistry. The traditional music of this region is combined with modern instruments which only makes the original sound even *more* visceral and earthy ... the root music takes hold of you!!! It does not let go. The unsuspecting listener becomes entranced by a traditionAL sound and an almost dying ancient culture ... fortunately it is being rediscovered and interpreted by musicians such as Deep Forest. I love the cover, the falling orange leaves and the &quot;psi&quot; symbol. The sunlight being filtered through the fog  is such an appropriate and absolutely well targeted symbol of the musical contents. Erika Borsos (erikab93)

0385335482|4.0|What a fun summer book!!!  Kinsella brings life and anxiety to her wonderful array of characters in this story of shopping and living beyond one's means!  If this were not so funny it would almost have a moral, but as it is, it will make you think twice about your shopping habits as well as your bill paying, even if you are not a shopaholic.  Kinsella gives shopping a new definition as a competitive sports event, accompanied with an ongoing comic twist that never stops.
0440224764|1.0|Very entertaining, it was fun to see how Patrick Lanighan had planned ahead and got away with his prize. yet the ending does not make any sense whatsoever. Not because it was sad, but because throught tbe book the author did not give any background to make this type of ending logical. I understand you have to add an unexpected twist, but this ending is almost an insult to the reader. The Brazilian lawyer could have run away with whole lot of money from the start, and even if she did not want any one to be after her, she still had the money to enjoy at her home town with man she presumabley loved and near her father. Disappointing end to a great book.
6305181810|4.0|THE RAINMAKER is a by the numbers adaptation of John Grisham's bestseller.  Director Francis Ford Coppola explores no new grounds in this film, but elicits competent and professional performances from a stellar cast.  Matt Damon who plays Rudy burst onto the scene in this movie, released just before his Oscar winning screenplay and starring role in GOOD WILL HUNTING.  Damon captures the youthful impetuosity and naivete of a just bar-approved lawyer who finds himself involved in a case against a big insurance company.  His assistant is played by a restrained Danny DeVito.  Their boss is played by an unusually understated Mickey Rourke, who shows up on screen looking halfway decent for a change. His clients are wonderfully played by Mary Kay Place and Johnny Whitworth.  Jon Voight delivers an Oscar-worthy performance as Damon's devilishly cold opponent; Roy Scheider has a brief scene as the CEO of the insurance company; Randy Travis has a thirty second scene as an irate juror; Virginia Madsen is wonderful in a small role as the claims adjustor who was fired; Claire Danes is appropriately cast as the abused wife who turns to Damon for help.  Oscar winner Teresa Wright turns up in a lovely role as an elderly lady who wants to leave her money to a tv evangelist.<br />THE RAINMAKER is perhaps a little too long (it clocks in well over two hours), and offers little in the way of suspense.  It is competent, involving and ultimately satisfying, however.  Matt Damon proved the hoopla about to come was deserved.
B000148KK2|5.0|Where have I been?  The girl in the other room is the first time I've experience the gift of Diana Krall.  This is absolutely one of the most soulful jazz CD I have ever had the pleasure to hear. My favorite cuts, &quot;I'm Coming Through&quot;, &quot;Black Crow&quot; and &quot;Departure Boy&quot; are so deep, heavy and thought provoking.  They take me back to the great recordings of the 60's where you were compelled to listen over and over and the meaning maybe difference each time. The entire CD is such a pedestal for Diana's voice.  I have to wonder how can someone so young sing with such deep emotion. Her talent with the piano and the instrumentation of the other musicians, especially the drummer and lead guitar, elevates this CD into the classic category along with the likes of john Coltrane and Miles Davis.
B0001WGDXK|5.0|Leonard Bernstein's live recording of Sibelius's First Symphony with the Vienna Philharmonic(from 1990, the year Bernstein died), featured on this 3-CD set (and previously out-of-print), is easily the greatest recording of this symphony ever. No one--not even Bernstein himself in his earlier NYP recording for Sony--has brought out the depth and power of this work as Bernstein does in this recording, making a strong case for this symphony as one of the greatest Romantic symphonies of all time.(Those looking for a taut, lean,  non-sentimental performance should look elsewhere, but they'd be missing the message of this symphony). The opening clarinet plays the main theme hauntingly and the main theme from the first movement is played like no other recording. Instead of a brisk, no-nonsense tempo that makes this theme sound a bit abrupt, Bernstein draws it out with intense passion, making it sound more Tchaikovskyesque than ever before. Lest one fear that Bernstein is all around too slow in this movement, he speeds up the tempo at just the right moments to create a nail-biting excitement that other performances lack. The slow movement is done beautifully, again with increased tempos in the development to the fast part, making one forget that this is the adagio. The scherzo is very exciting, with the drummers playing their hearts out to keep up with Bernstein's conducting. It is the last movement that really stands out. Bernstein starts it at a very deliberate tempo, to enhance anticipation for what's to come. The &quot;big tune&quot; is, in its first appearance, very powerful, but on the brisk side. The rest of the development is truly astonishing in its excitement but it's the return of the &quot;big tune&quot; that never ceases to amaze me. Bernstein draws it out to tear-jerking effect, making this tune perhaps the most moving one in all of classical music, topped by a crackerjack finale. Throughout, the sound quality is amazing in its realism and clarity(especially the drums and percussion), giving the entire performance a very hard-hitting effect. In sum, this performance of the First Symphony is worth the price of the entire set, as it is the best performance of this work you'll ever find, and one of the greatest classical performances of all time.<BR>  The Second Symphony is more idiosyncratic and is at times(especially the second movement)too slow. Still, Bernstein's pacing brings out elements of this score that you won't hear elsewhere, and if it isn't the first choice (try Ormandy/Philadelphia) it remains an important alternative perspective. The Fifth and Seventh Symphonies recieve very powerful performances that can easily be first recommendations (although Bernstein's own earlier Fifth with the NYP is even better), especially with powerhouse sound.<BR>  The Elgar was very controversial due to its slow tempos, but like the Second Symphony, remains a viable alternative. The Britten is performed flawlessly and could be anyone's first choice performance of this work.<BR>   In short, while everything on these 3 CDs is classic late Bernstein, the First Symphony is worth the price of admission and anyone who likes this work, or is just looking to discover Sibelius's Late Romantic style, must buy this CD set.

B0001Z36PK|5.0|Neil Hannon has outdone himself with this brilliant and beautiful new album, dedicated to his young daughter, Willow. The swelling orchestras complement his booming voice beautifully, and although we've seen gleaming snippets of his personality throughout his music, this one is intensely personal. &quot;Leaving Today,&quot; the most melancholy and &quot;Broadway&quot; of the album, borders on melodrama in its crescendo but never parodies itself: it gives us a hint about Hannon's dislike of leaving his family behind whilst going on tour. &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; has a gorgeous tango offsetting yet another emotional heartbreak. &quot;My Imaginary Friend&quot; mourns the loss of childhood innocence yet presents a charming vignette of life as a precocious little boy. &quot;Come Home Billy Bird&quot; is a snipe at career parents who neglect the source of their ambitions. The latter is the closest to the &quot;classic&quot; Divine Comedy sound, with harpsichords, sparkling female backing vocals and Neil gluing it all togethere...but it is fresh and original and a fantastic single release. PLAY THIS SONG ON AMERICAN RADIO.<BR>All in all, &quot;Absent Friends&quot; is an absolutely gorgeous album, beautifully produced, with some of the loveliest cover photography I've ever seen of Neil Hannon. This is a must-have for your collection, especially if you are a fan of Scott Walker, Jacques Brel, and orchestrated melancholy. Just lovely.

B00000I07P|3.0|Bon Jovi's &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; was a landmark album for the band.  It was the album that put the band &quot;on the map&quot;.  Bon Jovi had been building up a fan base in the 1980s with two successful albums &quot;Bon Jovi&quot; and &quot;7800 Degrees Fahrenheit&quot;.  With the huge commercial success of &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot;, Bon Jovi went from a cult band to a legitimate force in the music industry.   The album would produce two #1 songs out of the gate with the first two singles &quot;You Give Love a Bad Name&quot; and &quot;Livin on a Prayer&quot;.  This album did very well commercially.   It has some very good songs on this album, but I think it falls short of being a great album.   It also seems that the group is torn on whether they are an &quot;Arena Rock&quot; band, a &quot;Top 40&quot; band, or both .<br />&quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; came on the heels as 80s music began to embrace hard rock and even shades of Heavy Metal.  80s music was starting to move away from the synthesizer rhythms of the first part of the decade.   &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; came along at the right time - as this particular change was beginning to take shape.   As mentioned above, there are some very good songs on the collection and the two singles that went #1 immediately helped boost the sales of this album.   For a commercially successful album to be considered great, it must also have some strength with the songs that aren't released as singles.   This is where &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; falls short - there really isn't that unreleased song on this album that will grab at you.    To the defense of this album, all of the songs are very good - but very few are what I call great.<br />The one song that I do consider a great song is &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot;.  The whole song has an &quot;old west&quot; theme with a hard rock edge to it.  There is some incredible guitar work at the beginning.  Jon Bon Jovi has an incredible performance on vocals on this song, but it's Richie Sambora's acoustic guitar work that make this song.   I also think this is a very well written song - both lyrically and musically.   The middle of the song is where Richie goes from acoustic to electric guitar - flawlessly.    The final verses of the song - &quot;I Walk these streets, a loaded six string on my back..&quot; really are some intense music.    <br />You can hear some more pure &quot;Arena Rock&quot; music from Bon Jovi with &quot;Let It Rock&quot;.  I find the intro to &quot;Let It Rock&quot; just a little too long for my taste.   It isn't that I like long intros - I do like them.  But after 1 minute, the &quot;whoa whoa&quot; that begins the song is almost a letdown.  &quot;Raise Your Hands&quot; is another example of the Arena Rock sound.  This does have a better intro - some great electric guitar work by Richie Sambora goes very nicely into the chords of the song.   &quot;Raise Your Hands&quot; is a good song, but it doesn't have that quality that I feel makes it something special.  The one song on the album that wasn't released as a single that is very good is &quot;Wild in the Streets&quot;.  Tico Torres really should get some credit for some thundering drums that give this song a nice edge. Sambora is in high form as usual on this song - and Jon's vocals are riveting. This is the one song that was basically a Jon Bon Jovi solo effort in terms of songwriting (RIchie Sambora co-wrote the 9 other songs with Jon, and Desmond Child contributed to 4 songs).  Although &quot;Wild in the Streets&quot; starts out like a Top 40 song, it will take an &quot;Arena Rock&quot; feel by the end.  Still a nice song, but doesn't grab at you.<br />The one song that is very weak on this album is &quot;Never Say Goodbye&quot;.  This song is very Top 40ish.  It has a slower beat.  I don't believe it was ever released as a single, but got a lot of airplay on the radio. I don't understand why this song got airplay when there are better songs thatweren't released - such as &quot;Wild in the Streets&quot;.  Perhaps it had that feel of a High School Prom-ish song that made it popular.   As for some of the other songs &quot;Without Love&quot; is a nice song - again nothing special.   &quot;I'd Die For You&quot; has some nice instrumental, but I do feel falls short in terms of the lyrics (with the exception of the &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; line).  &quot;I'd Die For You&quot; has a similar keyboard intro to an older Bon Jovi classic &quot;Runaway&quot;.    &quot;Without Love&quot; and &quot;I'd Die For You&quot; are examples where Bon Jovi does struggle between that line between Arena Rock and Top 40 band.<br />The liner notes are solid.  All of the lyrics are included with this collection with a bunch of production credits listed at the end.  I didn't mention too much about the #1 songs - &quot;You Give Love a Bad Name&quot; and &quot;Livin on a Prayer.  The problem with them is that they were so overplayed in the 1980s - you probably aren't going to play them over and over again on this album.  This isn't meant to say the songs are negative - they still are good songs.   Because of the lack of depth in most of the remaining songs, I feel this is album is a bit overrated because it did well commercially.  The bottom line is - this album will appeal to the die hard Bon Jovi fan, but the casual fan may not care for this.
B000063JDE|1.0|Blue Velvet has got to be one of the strangest films I have ever seen. It started off o.k. but when we first see frank booth it just gets weirder and weirder. The film also suffers from bad script. The acting in the film is very poor expect Dennis Hopper.<BR>There are so many films like this and I can't understand why people think this one is so special. I was really looking forward to watching this when I bought the DVD but after watching it I felt cheated into buying a poor film.<BR>Overall bad film, bad acting and bad script. People who appeciate those three should steer clear.
0312995423|2.0|I read The Da Vinci Code first and then Angels &amp; Demons and they were both incredible reads. But this book is disappointing. There was no intrigue, it read very slowly and a lot of things are cliche and predictable. The main character, Susan Fletcher was so boring and too perfect. No surprising twist at the end. I'm going to read Deception Point. I hope it's better.
6301640659|4.0|I first heard about cruising when I was watching a documentary on Al Pacino and I couldn't belive that I had never heard of it. The film looked very Dark and I couldn't wait to see it. I waited six whole months to see when eventually I spent twelve pounds to watch it on filmfour. I taped it so I could watch it again. I was stunned at how much people didn't like the film. The film was a very interesting study of the gay underworld and Pacino's performance as a gay undercover cop was great. Although it does have some unexplained parts. Like the part where the naked cop is slapping Pacino and a killer suspect. I've watched the film many times and I still can't work out the ending. The only thing I can think of is that Pacino is the killer.<BR>Overall it was a great film with a few confusing moments.
0316666343|1.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book after hearing so many people rave about it, but I found it incredibly disappointing. As mentioned by another reviewer, I too had to force myself to finish it - I kept hoping that the book would redeem itself by the end, but the writing was not strong enough to follow through on what, initially, is an interesting idea.
B00008CLOA|1.0|I bought CD because man at work say it really good.  I think he wrong because songs sound like hippie music or like man who sing the songs too sleepy.  My review gone though!!  I say don't waste good earned money to buy CD.  Too hard undertanding songs too. Not good!!
B00000JY1X|5.0|Well, yes, there is some filler.  But for 3 CDs and 69 songs, Stephen Merritt is allowed some slack.  The rest is gorgeous, nearly a dictionary definition of indie pop.  Most of the instrumentation is sparse, allowing the witty lyrics to come to the foreground.  Many different styles appear here, with only the loose theme of &quot;love&quot; to tie them together.  A lot of the songs deal with the messy end of love - making this set perfect for the heartbroken as well as the head-over-heels couples.
B00005JN0A|5.0|The movie is what it is; raucous and sometimes clever low-brow humor. Parts were tedious (hot tub and boobs) and MANY other parts were just laugh-out-loud crazy. I can't stop giggling when I think of our heros' arrival at bombed-out-looking-not-quite-so-post-Soviet Bratislava to the strains of an old Red Army Chorus song (which I wish had been on the soundtrack CD). Jamie toting around the Frommer guides, expensive camera, and money belt was scaringly reminiscent of ME in Europe. It's easy to laugh now at how people must've seen me. The soundtrack is nothing special but fun nonetheless. As with the movie, its just something to pop into the changer when you need something light-heartedly fun. It is what it is, and as good as it can be for what it is. SO, as is, for what it is, it gets five stars.  I can only wonder how the movie played and the reactions it got in Europe!
B0001MDP3G|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie in the theatre and eagerly awaited the DVD release. Although I must say, as much as I enjoy movies with war themes, this one is not high on my list of favorites. Nonetheless, I wont think twice in playing it for guests in my home. The cinematography is fabulous and the supporting cast is great. However, what holds this movie back is the stale relationship between the main characters Inman and Ada. The chemistry between Law and Kidman is totally absent, perhaps in-part by a script which never allows them to develop any sense of a true love. If their love is simply an emotional concept that propells the &quot;idea of love&quot;, the script fails to deliver any insight within their respective characters to provide a basis for their assumed attachment. Inman lacks any form of appeal which makes Ada's adoration seem impossible. That being said, the movie is entertaining with a very interesting and enjoyable supporting cast. Most noteworthy is Ruby (Zellwegger) who steals each scene in which she appears. My favorite character is the Preacher who is very entertaining despite the brevity of his screen time. And like many of the Amazon reviewers, I agree, the ending basically sucks.

B0000509C4|2.0|Thanks for a crappy rental blockbuster. This movie blew more then a three dollar hooker. My friend and I were so disapointed in this movie. We both saw the first one and loved it. Every story in that one was awesome and they all had a cool comic book feel and each one was different from the other. Well the sequel had a feeling of &quot;When will this movie end&quot; ok i will be honest the second story was really good and the blob thing was awesome. I know it is just a movie but it did bother me that the car battery never died after the car being on for so long but again it is just a movie. that story is the reason why i gave it two stars instead of one.<BR>The last story was the one that ruined the movie. I mean the first story was neat but not great and the second one was cool but the third one was poop on a stick. All it was, was a black guy in a raincoat screaming &quot;thanks for the ride lady&quot; while getting killed thirty times. The only thing that terrified me was how i laughed during that scene because i was thinking what if Dave Chapelle remade this but with him as the black guy. It would have been hilarious. So just rent the first one and if you do really want to see this just watch the first two stories and skip the last one, you will thank me

B0000029GA|5.0|Best Hip-Hop album of all time!!  Yes, this is better than any 2Pac album ever.  2Pac wasn't even this much of an genius.  This album changed the face of hip-hop forever.  Back when the hip-hop was ran by the east coast, Nas was the only person that took hip hop back to its roots.  He was the best rapper on the east coast, not Biggie.  In my opinion Biggie wasn't even on the same level as Nas.  If Biggie was still alive today he wouldn't be better than Nas.  This ablum literally makes me cry, because I think about how the rap game is today, and it's pathetic.  Illmactic is so ahead of its time.  Just think when have you ever heard an album like this.  I'll help you out, you haven't.  It's been ten years since Illmatic came out, and there still isn't an album like this.  My question is, Will there ever be??  Nas certainly secured his spot as one of the best emcees ever, if not the best ever.  In my opinion if Nas isn't the best ever, then he ties 2Pac for the number 1 spot.  Nas doesn't have to talk about guns, girls, and money.  It seems like he is better than that.  Everyone just follows behind what somebody else does in hip hop today.  If don't believe me just listen to Slick Rick and Biggie.  Slick Rick originizied the art of story telling and Biggie just came behind Slick Rick and did the same thing, he just added violence to his stories.  Also all of Nas's albums sound very different.  You can't say that for any other artists, not even 2Pac himself.  You never know where Nas is coming from.  Perfect example who would've thought that Nas would come out with &quot;If I Ruled The World&quot; after the classic &quot;Illmatic&quot;.  In conclusion &quot;Illmatic&quot; is a must have for any music fan, not just hip hop fan.  If don't have this album, then you are really missing out on the essence of TRUE HIP-HOP!!!

0226443221|4.0|Klinenberg does a wonderful job of introducing us to the social conditions that were necessary for the disaster in Chicago to take place during the summer of 1995.  The conditions, we learn, were primarily spatially problematic.  I don't want to give too much away - but I'll say this: with dense urban environements, this disaster never would have happened.  The North/South Lawndale experience was especially effective.  Klinenberg kept me going almost all the way through the book, so I highly recommend it.  I only give him 4 stars because he loses the idea of density at some point and harps (too much, IMO) on the media.  That's fine, though: he did his research, and this book is excellent.
6305922756|5.0|Alright, I'm not going to bore you with the details or story of this sublime Reiner \\"documentary,\\" nor am I going to babble on and on about how spot-on a parody of NWOBHM (that's \\"New Wave Of British Heavy Metal\\" to the uninitiated) this is.<br />Instead, I will offer you some quotes. Those alone should give you plenty of insight as to why this is one of the greatest movies of all time. To wit:<br />\\"Oh, there actually is, uh... there was a Saint Hubbins?\\"<br />\\"That's right, yes.\\"<br />\\"What was he the saint of?\\"<br />\\"He was the patron saint of quality footwear.\\"<br />\\"You know, just simple lines intertwining, you know, very much like - I'm really influenced by Mozart and Bach, and it's sort of in between those, really. It's like a Mach piece, really. It's sort of...\\"<br />\\"What do you call this?\\"<br />\\"Well, this piece is called \\"Lick My Love Pump\\".<br /><br />\\"As long as there's, you know, sex and drugs, I can do without the rock and roll.\\"<br />\\"Here lies David St. Hubbins... and why not?\\"<br /><br />\\"Dozens of people spontaneously combust each year.

None more black.\\"<br />\\"We are Spinal Tap from the UK - you must be the USA!\\"<br />\\"You can't really dust for vomit.\\"<br />\\"This pretentious ponderous collection of religious rock psalms is enough to prompt the question, 'What day did the Lord create Spinal Tap, and couldn't he have rested on that day too?'\\"<br />And of course: \\"Why don't you just make ten louder and make ten be the top number and make that a little louder?<br />\\"These go to eleven.\\"<br /><br />Not laughing? Well, the visuals are even funnier--malfunctioning stage props, a guitar solo that probably singlehandedly gave birth to the \\"neo-classical\\" shred style, unique ways to use a violin, and of course lots and lots of retarded sexuality and bad poetry. Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Derek Shearer absolutely NAIL it. Everybody should have this film.

B00008NG5V|5.0|Jack Johnson's On And On is a great CD to just chill and listen to. Has great guitar and vocals throughout the whole CD, not just a few good songs like most. My favorites are Gone, Taylor, Holes To Heaven, and Wasting Time. Also, most of the lyrics on his songs hit deep and actually mean something. I would recommend this album to anyone who likes Ben Harper, John Mayer, or OAR. They all have that mellow and laid back vibe.<BR>1. Times Like These-great song, i love the verses in the song, not a great chourus<BR>2.Horizon Has Been Defeated-great sound, not great lyrics but good to listen to<BR>3.Traffic in the Sky-one of my favorite songs on the album, I believe that many people who wanna mellow out will enjoy this.<BR>4.Taylor-great guitar, decent lyrics, one of my faves and shows a good message if you pick up the subtext<BR>5.Gone-in my opinion the best song on the CD, great lyrics and decent music<BR>6.Cupid-good song not my fav but still good<BR>7.Wasting Time-decent sound but GREAT lyrics i love how he points out \\"Everybody else\\"<BR>8.Holes to Heaven-good guitar, good lyrics, good vocals, good bass, and good percussion, all around good song<BR>9.Dreams Be Dreams-like this song because I think Jack shows your part of himself and what he is feeling<BR>10.Tomorrow Morning-starts kinda slow but still a good mellow out song<BR>11.Fall Line-again not one of my faves but still easy to listen too<BR>12.Cookie Jar-nice'n slow<BR>13.Rodeo Clowns-a little more upbeat kinda reminds me more of ben harper with a little less bongo<BR>14.Cocoon-very slow and a nice chorus<BR>15.Mediocre Bad Guys-doesnt sound like typical Jack Johnson but I love the chourus<BR>16.Symbol in my Driveway-good way to end a CD and I think its a nice song<BR>     Anyone I have ever entroduced this CD to has loved it. No matter the age, sex, race, or anything everyone from my dad to some of my friends we all love it and I would reccomend it to ANYONE
B00008DDSC|4.0|What's really terrific abiout this film is not that it has spanking and \\"degredation\\", but that it has the nerve to show that some \\"alternative\\" lifestyles actually make people shine.<BR>By becoming a submissive in an S&M relationship, the main character not only grows into a mature, confident adult but she also learns to assert her needs and wants.<BR>The romance is touching, and sweet.<BR>My only complaint is with the mother's character (Leslie Ann Warren) is too outrageous and not believable.<BR>All in all, this is an inspiring, romatic and fun movie for anyone who enjoys quality film!
B000053VAZ|4.0|But what else is old? &quot;Benny and Joon&quot; tells the unlikely love story of a mentally ill woman, Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson) and an odd man who walks around doing Buster Keaton impressions, Sam (Johnny Depp). Sam comes to live with Joon and her brother, Benny (Aidan Quinn) after Joon loses a card game in which Sam was part of the stakes (he had previously been living with his cousin, who could not stand him). Sam and Joon fall in love, leaving Benny in the dark as he tries to sort out his own romantic life involving a waitress (Julianne Moore).<br />The movie is charming, funny, and not as by-the-book as one might think. All of the actors give great performances, but the standout is Johnny Depp, as usual. He obviously put a great deal of time into preparing for this role, studying the old silent film stars. It pays off greatly. It's hard to rank Johnny Depp's performances, but I would put this one up towards the top.<br />All in all, if you want to see an original romantic comedy, rent this movie. It's extremely entertaining. I just cannot recommend it enough -- see it as soon as possible. I give it four stars because it's by far not the best movie I've ever seen, but nonetheless it's very good.

B0002CHIJW|4.0|When movies first came out on video there were two legendary exploitation films I had to track down. One was &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; and the other was &quot;I Spit on Your Grave,&quot; which is actually the more memorable film of the pair overall (although I do grant the highest place to the &quot;hook&quot; scene in TCM). Director Meir Zarchi's 1978 film has become rather infamous, since critics hated it, audiences were outraged, and the film was banned in Germany and Great Britain. The story, such as it is, finds Jennifer Hill (Camille Keaton, Buster's grand-niece) out in the woods of Connecticut to work on a novel when she crosses the path of some local boys who decide she should be the first sexual partner for their mentally-disabled friend. When he cannot complete the rape, his friends do it for him. Then they decide that they are not done with Jennifer.<br />At issue are not Jennifer's specific acts of revenge, including the infamous bathroom scene, but rather the series of brutal rapes that precede them. I do not want to meet anyone who is not disturbed by these rape scenes and I think it is fairly obvious that Zarchi intended to make audiences uncomfortable. In retrospect you have to wonder about all those movies with rape scenes that do NOT upset the audience (the current obvious exception that proves the rule would be what happens in &quot;Monster&quot; right before the first murder). But Zarchi certainly pours it on thick, absolutely assuring that things go beyond the tolerance level of anyone who watches this film. So the bottom line is that this film will upset you and it is therefore effective at doing exactly what it wants to do.  I have always considered this an &quot;X&quot; rated movie although I would not consider it pornographic in the traditional sense. But it is a very disturbing film and I do not think I would want my kids to see it until after they graduate college (if ever). Anyone renting this film for cheap thrills is in for a shock.<br />As I now understand it, this 1978 film was originally released as &quot;Day of the Woman,&quot; but that rather innocuous title was replaced by the well known &quot;I Spit on Your Grave,&quot; although the film was also screened as &quot;I Hate Your Guts&quot; and &quot;The Rape and Revenge of Jennifer Hill.&quot; All of this is interesting since it seems the producers were trying to pass off this film with both higher and lover levels of pretention.  The cult status here is more for the shock value than any cheap artistic pretentions, that is for sure.r a shock.<br />As I now understand it, this 1978 film was originally released as &quot;Day of the Woman,&quot; but that rather innocuous title was replaced by the well known &quot;I Spit on Your Grave,&quot; although the film was also screened as &quot;I Hate Your Guts&quot; and &quot;The Rape and Revenge of Jennifer Hill.&quot; All of this is interesting since it seems the producers were trying to pass off this film with both higher and lover levels of pretention.

B00006RG9K|1.0|Genesis in 1976 put out a &quot;Genesis in Concert&quot; laser disc which I imagine is a DVD. This show is far better than this DVD. The medley did more to make the songs that made Genesis a rock band into one pathectic collage. Do not get this DVD as it is a waste of money.
B000001FI7|5.0|Trip-hop was never so dark and magnificently despairing as it is here. Portishead draws listeners into a velvety abyss in debut album &quot;Dummy,&quot; a glorious blend of jazzy instrumentation, subtle electronica, and Beth Gibbons' sweet moaning vocals.<br />&quot;Mysterons&quot; opens with an chilly, ghostly air, followed by the exotic despair of &quot;Sour Times&quot; and the jazzy, eerie &quot;Strangers&quot; and &quot;Wandering Star.&quot; Portishead delves into pure trip-hop in the pulsing &quot;It Could Be Sweet&quot; and &quot;Numb,&quot; then synthesizes strings and stately organ in &quot;It's A Fire,&quot; before wrapping things up with the steady lament &quot;Glory Box,&quot; with its undulating riffs.<br />A noir feel permeates &quot;Dummy,&quot; giving a grounded feel to the spacier edges of the music. It's easy to imagine trenchcoats, smoky offices, rainy days and femme fatales set to this music. It's soaked in melancholy and dreamy depression, set to music.<br />The blend of lounge music and trip-hop could have been awkward, but it blends seamlessly. The Rhodes and magnificent Hammond organ are the core of the silky unearthly sound, adding an epic feel to many of the songs. At the same time, the flexible guitar riffs and jazzy percussion bring it down to earth. And the Hammond does double-time as a jazz instrument as well, even when paired with strings.<br />Beth Gibbons's vocals are outstanding: high and clear and sweet, except in &quot;Strangers,&quot; where she sounds like her voice is being filtered through an old radio. She pours plenty of emotion into the despairing lyrics. The songs themselves are simple and evocative, with loneliness and regret dripping from them. (&quot;The salvation I desire/Keeps getting me down&quot;)<br />Jazz and trip-hop blend seamlessly into the beautiful haunting whole that is &quot;Dummy.&quot; A beautiful experience, and one of the best albums of the 1990s.

Her realtionship w/ Jack is awesome and cute. What every woman day dreams about. The best thing about this book is its funny like a sitcom and I don't have to wait a week to know more. Its fun, and enjoyable!
B00005JNA2|5.0|I just came back from the theatres after watching \\"Before Sunset\\" and OMG, my mind is officially blown.  I went in with high expectations, and all of them were met, then some.<br />First of all I've always been a huge fan of \\"Before Sunrise\\", considering it to be the best romantic movie in history.  That said, I'm delighted to announce that \\"Before Sunset\\" is a sequel completely worthy of its matchless predecessor.  I think I speak for all fans of \\"Before Sunrise\\" that we never expected to see a sequel, and that this movie is a dream come true.<br />Everything that made the first movie so great is duplicated here, but in a fresh and engaging way.  Star-crossed but estranged lovers Jesse and Celine are reunited after 9 years in Paris, and we are invited to follow them along in a voyueristic, real-time conversation for a little more than an hour.  Like the first movie, Before Sunset is really just one long conversation.  If that sounds boring, don't be fooled.  Director Linklater knows his stuff; this is his way of doing thangs, and he does it well.  It's perhaps a big artistic gamble, but it works, just as it did for the first movie.<br />The conversation begins somewhat mundane and chit-chatty, but it only adds to the realism, and gradually builds in crescendo as Jesse and Celine slowly reveal to each other what they REALLY want to say, yet are afraid to.  There were really very few dull moments as the conversation is richly layered with multiple dimensions of meaning encoded in what is said, not said, and subtle body language.  We find out that after all these years, Celine and Jesse are still very much in love with each other, and both are frustrated by both the past misfortunes that prevented their originally planned reunion in Vienna, and the unfortunate circumstance that makes their current reunion highly problematic.  Yet all this is skilfully and subtly conveyed, and we are not beaten over the head with it, as a lesser director may have been tempted to do.  The car-ride scene towards the end when Celine reveals her sadness and misery that Jesse is now married with kids was done brilliantly and with heart-breaking poignancy.  Equally poignant was Jesse's \\"retort\\", revealing his recurring dream of the French girl he could never forget.<br />Both Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy make wonderful performances in this movie and have rich, kinetic chemistry with each other.  We really believe that they are in love.  However, I am a guy, so most of my attention was upon the certifiably radiant and gorgeous Julie Delpy.  Delpy/Celine is any guy's dream girl.  Smart, funny, insecure yet independent, and genuinely adorable. Her beauty is a down-to-Earth kind glowing with infinite softness and femininity.  Plus there's the light but irresistible French accent thing going.  I fell in love with her in the first film.  After the second film I can barely endure the sweet misery.  Hawke does a fine job too, creating a character I truly like and identify with.  We see the difference between Jesse's idealistic romanticism and Celine's cautious cynacism, yet we also see the undeniable link between them that is the source of their love.<br />Jesse has only about an hour to spend with Celine before his flight leaves, and as the film progresses both the audience and the characters feel the rising dread of the inevitable.  Once again, everything is done with minimalist, artful grace.  But we see and understand nevertheless with crystal clarity what is going on in Jesse's mind as he desperately attempts to squeeze out every possible extra precious second he can with Celine.  We are on the edge of our seats biting our nails as the end nears, the tension of the unsaid hanging over us and Jesse like a dark menace.  What will Jesse do?  Will he abandone his (albeit dysfunctional) marriage and be with Celine?  Will he get on that flight back to New York?  What makes the audience so enthralled is that not only do we not know what is going to happen, it's obvious that neither does Jesse.  Jesse is right there with us in real time, the battle of desire vs. obligation raging in his mind.  He tries so desperately to buy more time, perhaps to decide, or perhaps just to see what he is going to do, as if watching his own actions unfold outside of himself.<br />The ending of \\"Before Sunrise\\" was brilliant and unforgettable, but ultimately poignant and ended on a \\"downer\\" tone.  I know that it was supposed to be an ambiguous ending in which cynics know they never met at the appointed place, and romantics believed they did.  But Celine's little sad chuckle to herself at the end of the film seemed a very clear indication, at least to me, that they never kept their promise.  That said, the ending of Before Sunset was utterly sublime and genius, one of the most satisfying conclusions to a movie I have ever seen.  It is technically ambiguous (keeping a coherent style with the first movie), but it appears to me to be obvious that the romantics win!!!  Ha ha true, you may choose to interpret it another way, but to me the tone was quite different from the ending of the first movie, this one being an undeniable \\"upper\\".  Ironic then, that in the first movie Jesse and Celine (apparently) have sex twice whereas in this one they don't even kiss.  I was clapping hard and screaming after the ending.  It completely satiated me.  And if Richard Linklater is reading this review, I'd like to first thank him so much for making such a peerless duo of films, and secondly I must demand that he NEVER MAKE A THIRD INSTALLMENT!!!  Don't you DARE make a \\"Before Sun[blank]\\"!!!  Celine+Jesse forever!!!  DO NOT MAKE ANOTHER one of the series, unless you are going to show Celine and Jesse happily married in Paris with Celine pregnant lying in Jesse's bed.  If they didn't end up together I don't want to hear about it!  I like the ending to this one and I am satisfied with my interpretation!<br />The only weakness of \\"Before Sunset\\" is that I don't really think it works if you didn't see the first movie.  This is especially problematic since the first movie, although an excellent cult favourite, was not widely seen by audiences.  Yes, even if you've never seen Before Sunrise, you will enjoy this movie.  However I estimate that something around 60% of Before Sunset's emotional impact will be lost, as well as references to events in the first movie.  In fact the two are so inseparable in a storyline perspective that I now see them as one long movie (or conversation).  Thus, if you're going to see Before Sunset in theatres (and I HIGHLY recommend that you do), why don't you give yourself the full experience and rent \\"Before Sunrise\\" beforehand?

B0001GOH6Q|2.0|Tim Burton's taste for the bizarre is alive and well here, but &quot;Big Fish&quot; is proof that his ability to distinguish the enchanting kind from the weird-for-the-sake-of-being-weird kind has finally slipped. This patchwork movie never quite manages to bring together its random sampling of strange tales and odd characters and the overall effect is an annoyance that drains the wonder out of the wonderous patches and the inspiration out of the inspirational ones. <br />It's just kind of blah.
0743216458|5.0|Band of Brothers follows an elite group of soldiers in World War II. Did I say &quot;an&quot; elite group? I may be understating them a bit; from this book, they appear to be one of the greatest collection of soldiers to ever face combat, a group a young men who excelled in all endeavors and played a major part in winning the Second World War.   Once you understand how much material is covered in this book, you will be amazed it is told in a mere 300 pages. While much is gained from this thrifty narrative (it is really hard to put down), it does becoming confusing for those of us who aren't familiar with the content. I have a hard time with some of the military terminology (I don't know which is higher, 1st or 2nd lieutenant). Ambrose doesn't slow down to explain these things either. He zips right on to the next training mission or engagement. This isn't a book about the military in general. Rather, it is a tightly focused account of one group's experience in WWII, from training to their post-war lives.       Easy Company is also a very large group, making it nearly impossible to keep all the names straight. Ambrose doesn't want to focus on a few people, because greatness was found in the actions of many. Therefore, it at times becomes difficult to recall who exactly is at the center of the story playing out. The men all seem to become a conglomerate, one nameless, faceless soldier who does everything.       Those may be two problems I have, but don't read this as a negative review at all. This is a powerful and important book. I am in awe of the brave, young men who signed up for Easy Company, knowing they would have the hardest training and most difficult assignments in the war. To a man, the boys answered they wanted this challenge so they could trust the man beside them in battle. The only way to know you are surrounded by the best is to become the best yourself, and these boys did that.       I am humbled by reading their exploits and feel blessed to share a country and a flag with these men. I only fear I will be haunted by these tales, as I realize it will be hard to do as much with my life as these men did with theirs; they did indeed set the bar high for the rest of us.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|Take John Steinbeck's Pulitzer-Prize-Winning Novel.  Turn it into a movie and let John Ford direct it, and get Henry Fonda to star.  In 1940 you could hardly find a more certain recipe for a cinema classic.<br />As good as the film is, it really should be a companion-piece to Steinbeck's original masterpiece, and if you haven't read it I recommend setting aside enough time to read one of the greatest pieces of American literature ever written.<br />That being said, the medium of the cinema allows for a visual impact that can't be matched with the written word.<br />The Grapes of Wrath follows the Joad family during the great depression.  That period of economic hardship hit the farmers in Oklahoma a little harder than the rest of the world, at the time of the dust bowl the &quot;Okies&quot; were at the end of their ropes, financially speaking.<br />Thousands of Okies packed up the house after being foreclosed and moved out to California - many winding up around Bakersfield, at the California end of old US Route 66. (Merle Haggard's family did so and the &quot;Okie from Muscogee&quot; wrote about it in songs like &quot;California Cottonfields&quot;.)<br />Anyway, this is the historical context of the movie.  The theme of the movie, and of Steinbeck's book, is the ability of the human spirit to remain intact in these worst of times.  The Joads suffer terrible humiliations, one after another, most of them because of their desperate financial status.  But as the story proceeds we see that they are fundamentally decent, hard-working people, and every time life knocks them down they get back up, brush the dirt off themselves, and keep moving forward. As a national characteristic, this was an important trait because this was the generation that produced the hard-working, high-minded individuals who did important things like win World War II, followed by America's greatest financial flourishing and the Baby Boom.  Tom Brokaw called them &quot;America's Greatest Generation&quot;.<br />The cast is picture-perfect, with Henry Fonda as the spirited Tom Joad and John Carradine as the former preacher with a new social consciousness.  Jane Darwell won a well-deserved Best Supporting Actress Award as Ma Joad, and the remainder of the cast is in every way equal to the story and the film.uot;.<br />The cast is picture-perfect, with Henry Fonda as the spirited Tom Joad and John Carradine as the former preacher with a new social consciousness.

B0002234LS|5.0|Depp is brilliantly wicked in this one. <br />The story keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way through as you learn more about Depp's complex character.  You want to believe in the good in him, but the evil takes over.  Very frightening!!
B00028HBKC|5.0|This was in my opinion not a movie but an experience. Mel Gibson did such a great job of potraying the last hours of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ's life. The movie was so moving and touching. I can't imagine having any of that done to me. Unfortunately, Jesus really didn't have a choice. That was foretold to happen to Jesus so we could be washed clean from our sins and have everlasting life. <br />And to those who think that this movie was unrealistic in some respects you're right. It wasn't entirely realistc...because Jesus looked even worse then what they showed. In the Bible it clearly states that you couldn't even recognize Jesus that was how badly beaten he was.<br />But, as to why no one helped him when he was being beaten or why he let them arrest him it was because it was foretold for it to happen that way and Jesus knew that and so did his followers.<br />Also, people who loved this movie like me aren't dumb. No one is dumb everyone has their own opinion and that's fine to God. But, this is what happened to our Lord and Savior and those who don't believe it to be realistic must not be those that are walking in the light. Because anyone who was would know that this movie was very realistic and that it was meant to happen that way. I love you Jesus!
B00008X5J3|2.0|I saw nothing on the cover to indicate this was mainly a musical.  The minimal story line was squeezed in between 110 minutes of singing and dancing..... I would describe as &quot;interpretive modern jazz&quot;.  We finally used &quot;fast forward&quot; to speed through this dancing and at the end threw the VHS tape in the rubbish.  What a disappointment.
0812550706|5.0|Based on the 1977 novelette &quot;Ender's Game,&quot; the Tor novel debuted in 1985. It was both a Nebula and Hugo Award winner, which shows that both fans and fellow science fiction writers thought this was a novel of distinction. I heartily agree, having originally read the novelette more than 25 years ago, the novel at least twice in the first year it was published, and having contemplated the social questions it raised many times in the intervening decades.<br /><br />Andrew &quot;Ender&quot; Wiggin thinks he is playing computer-simulated war games; he is, in fact, engaged in something far more desperate. Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever-harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.<br /><br />Since the original stories publication, our language and society has changed so dramatically, that it is good to see how well the original theme has held up. Unfortunately, the later books in the series (After `Speaker for the Dead') did not have the verve and impact to keep my attention. The character \\"Ender\\" was distorted by time, age and experience - creating a less sympathetic being than the one portrayed in this far-future coming-of-age story.<br /><br />Please do read this novel in the context of the time it was written. Reagan was president of the US, the Soviet Union was still his \\"Evil Empire,\\" rap and hip-hop had not filled every niche of society with swear words, personal computers were just making slight in-roads into society, and there was still a bit of innocence in the world. A fine novel - highly recommended.
B0001DI0FI|1.0|Master and commander, well Russel was nominated for his acting, all the reviews said how good it was, I think they must have shown it at the morgue as it was DEAD boring.... I had a flight to take and great the movie was Master and Commander. So with great anticipation I sat down to enjoy this raved about movie. I have never known a 3 hour flight to last for 6 and a half hours, well that's how long it seemed to take for this movie to finish. I had to go to the WC half way through the movie, even without sound it looked boring.  Down the back of the plane were the air crew, each with their own portable DVD players watching other movies..  I wonder why???  The most boring dead beat story to come to the big screen in the past 10 years..... Don't waste your money!!!!!!!
B00006BTCA|3.0|This is a promising debut, at least more so than albums like \\"Pablo Honey\\" and \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" were.       I can sort of understand the Joy Division comparisons since these songs have atmospheric guitar, but I think the similarities end there.  It's important to remember that JD were breaking new musical ground when they came out with what they were doing in the late 70s (i.e, they sounded like no one else before them).  Furthermore, I don't think there is quite the same level of raw innovative talent and synergy among the members of Interpol.  Fans of TOTBL may want to do themselves a favor and pick up a copy of JD's \\"Unknown Pleasures\\"..      I'll agree with another reviewer that this is probably the strongest debut by an American band since Pearl Jam released their great debut, \\"Ten.\\"  It is at least refreshing to hear a band out of this country that sounds, if not totally original, derivative of GOOD bands.     Although somewhat generic in overall sound, one of the coolest things about Interpol's music is that virtually all songs develop as they go, often progressing into very nice endings; Obstacles 1 + 2 and PDA are good examples of this.     Hopefully these guys will stay together, continue to experiment and expand their ideas and instrumentation, try out some more interesting producers to work with on their next albums, and most importantly, develop a more unique sound.      No bad songs on this record, though I thought \\"Leif Erikson\\" was most impressive, followed by \\"Obstacle 2,\\" \\"Hands Away,\\" and the aggressive \\"Roland\\".
B0002234LS|3.0|There is only one word to describe this movie: weird. Johnny Depp makes this movie, however, the plot stinks. It was confusing and weird. The trailer makes the movie seem spooky and scary, but it was not. I didnt jump or get scard once. Coming from the writer of &quot;Panic Room&quot;, I was expecting a lot more but i got a lot less. DO NOT waste your time with this stinker of a movie. It was more like a NBC mini- series.

B00002MZ4W|5.0|I impulsively bought this CD after having listened to Tidal over and over. I had heard &quot;Fast as you Can&quot; and &quot;Limp&quot; back when teen pop was all the rage, but they didn't make me want to go buy the album itself. Then again, I did buy the Pokemon soundtrack, so what did I know? Not a lot, since this CD is worth every penny in its price.<br />This album is great in every sense of the word. I don't regret buying this album for one second. This is the kind of album that doesn't draw comparisons to other artists. It makes other artists be compared to you, and it's the kind of album every artist dreams of making. <br />Fiona sounds like she's been doing this for years. Not only was she very young, but it would have been easy for her to give in and make the kind of pop music that was big at the time. She didn't and for that alone she deserves credit. <br />1)On the Bound: a great album opener. One of my favorite songs on the album.<BR>2)To Your Love: a really good song. Very uptempo and fast.<br />3)Limp: another one of my favorites. This song is fierce and it makes you afraid to be the man who inspired this song.<BR>4)Love Ridden: a slower song. It keeps the momentum going.<BR>5)Paper Bag: a strange and very good song.<BR>6)A Mistake: probably my favorite song on the album. Very honest and unique.<BR>7)Fast As You Can: I love this song. I love the changes it makes tempo-wise.<BR>8)The Way Things Are: another one of my favorites. She really nails this song.<BR>9)Get Gone: I love the chorus. This has some of her most clever lyrics.<BR>10)I Know: a great way to end a great album. Very slow and reflective.<br />So there you have it. I highly recommend this CD. Hopefully, her next album will be out soon. It will be hard to follow up this album, but I know Fiona can do it.

B00024BHTC|4.0|Nightwish is one of my favourite bands and I've enjoyed pretty much every album.  This one is no exception.  I first saw the video for &quot;Nemo&quot; and then finally got the album.  Most of the tracks are rather... meh... ok.  But I really enjoy &quot;Wish I Had An Angel&quot; and &quot;Ghost Love Score&quot;.  I gave it 4 stars... because I like it a lot, but as I previously noted... some of the songs are just mediocre or not really that great.  I'd recommend Century Child first if you are just now discovering them.
B00006L83N|5.0|With their latest masterpiece The Odysey, Symphony X proves to the world that they're still alive and still kicking ass. Almost 10 years into their career, this band is still putting out music that rivals the best of the newest Prog Metal bands. As compared to their last album &quot;The New Mythology&quot;, Symphony X's latest release is definately less orchestral overall, and more straight forward metal. The opening track Inferno is a firestorm of metal, purely brilliant. After this killer track, the next couple of tunes sound kind of flat, but in no way bad. Accolade II may be my favorite track on the album. It's an amazing combination of heavy rock and classical orchestral elements... Truly a brilliant track. Once again, after a killer knockout track, the next couple sound kind of like filler. No worries though, as the excellence returns with Awakenings, a song about transitions of a person through life. The choruses of this song are what great music is made of. Yet, no matter how great this track is, it pales in comparison to... THE ODYSEY. A 24 minute musical experience... Its heavy, its acoustic, its metal, its gentle, its orchestral, its everything... And watch out for the last part of the journey: &quot;Champion of Ithica&quot;. This part of the epic is KILLER... Just the way I describe this album. Epically killer. CHECK IT OUT TODAY!
B0000E6XH3|4.0|I never owned the CD by Daft Punk.  The only songs I knew were the singles that were played on the radio.  This movie is truly an impressive piece of art.  Even songs that are rather boring are exciting simply because of the story telling on screen.  The songs fit so perfectly with the action visually, even on instrumental songs.  You can read the other customer reviews that say all I think, so I'll talk about something else on the DVD:<br />The sound itself.  The DVD has DTS and Dolby Digital.  I've only listened to the Dolby Digital so far, but it's safe to assume DTS wouldn't be totally differant.  I was a slightly dissapointed (only because I was perhaps overly expecting more) that the music itself doesn't take advantage of all five speakers.  Instead, the music is basically the same old two-channel stereo mix from the CD.  The use of the rear speakers and the center speaker are when there are sound effects onscreen, which are rare.
B000089RVR|5.0|I loved Dido's first CD, and I didn't know if she had it in her to make a terrific sophomore album. Well, Dido proves here that she has the talent to stick around for years to come. Every song works here. The best thing about Dido is that her songs are deceptively simple. She tackles some pretty dark themes, and you don't really notice that until you listen to the album over and over. &quot;White Flag&quot; was a great choice for a first single. It shows that Dido is one of those artists who is able to sing about her shortcomings in a relationship rather than blaming someone else. There are so many good songs here, and it is for that reason alone I think you should buy this album. Dido is here to stay, and it'd be too bad if you didn't pick up this very good album.<br />1)White Flag: a really good song.<BR>2)Stoned: I love the beat.<BR>3)Life for Rent: I love the meaning behind the song.<BR>4)Mary's in India: a great showcase for her voice. The ending is a little surprising.<BR>5)See You When You're 40: another really cool song.<BR>6)Don't Leave Home: one of my favorites.<BR>7)Who Makes You Feel: I love the way her voices builds on this song. The beat is cool too.<BR>8)Sand in my Shoes: you can tell she really feels this song. It's very good.<BR>9)Do You Have a Little Time: another good song.<BR>10)This Land is Mine: another good showcase for her voice.<BR>11)See the Sun: this song is a great way to end the album. Very uplifting and terrific. One of my favorites.<BR>HIDDEN TRACK: a really good, simple song. It takes a while to start, so don't turn off your CD player. <br />This is a really good CD. I highly recommend it.

B0002234LS|3.0|Secret Window stars Johnny Depp as Mort, a writer living reclusively after breaking up with his wife. His already troubled state is made worse when a sinister character (John Turturro) shows up at his door claiming that Mort plagiarized one of his stories. It turns out that the two stories are very similar, but who stole it from whom? Both Depp and Turturro are interesting and versatile actors, and both give great performances here. The first half of the movie was so suspenseful and engrossing that I was disappointed when it turned very predictable, and in a way reminiscent of several other recent films. The acting, photography and direction are good throughout, but the script falling back on an overused gimmick prevents this film from rising above the ordinary.
0553382179|1.0|Usually that type of rhetoric is saved for religious texts. the previous reviewer might want to reconsider her hyperbole.  This is just a book of housecleaning and home organizing tips, although the author has seen fit to sprinkle in more than a liberal dose of adulation allegedly written by her adoring fans.  And therein lies part of the problem: too much space dedicated to self-aggrandizing.  If you want this type of thing, why buy the book?  You can get it for free on her website, which by the way, also advertises a whole host of home organizing products, turning house-cleaning into a religious industry.  In another culture, she'd have everyone screaming &quot;Jihad on Clutter!&quot;  How does becoming so mindlessly sloganized help you get your life organized?  With so many other books on this topic, it's a safe bet you could take a chance with any one of them and get a better book.
B0000AQVCL|2.0|After one listen to this CD, which thankfully I don't own, here's the low(let)down.  I heard their radio singles and thought to myself, here's the next band who will be loved by the same folks who buy in to music by the likes of the White Stripes, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and the Hives among others.  To me, all of this music sounds like a rehash of mainstream material coming in part from the 60s 70s and 80s.  AC/DCs definitely in there, yeah--rip from a band not originally known for, well, originality.  To get back to my point, sure enough, this CD has shown up in collections of folks I know who also have the other aforementioned albums.  Predictability.  You buy this album and you are cool because every goon out there with a radio knows every lyric to every song--not because the music and lyrics are at all new, heartfelt, or groundbreaking.  It won't be long until this music gathers dust in a bargain bin.
B00000IAU3|4.0|This is one of those albums that deserved to sell millions of copies. I understand why so many people compare her to Sarah McLachlan and Sinead O'Connor, but that isn't a bad thing at all. Would you rather hear someone who sounds like those two great artists or someone who sounds like the latest cookie cutter teen pop tart? Dido's voice is not interchangeable with most of what's out there right now, and that's what I like about her. <br />1)Here With Me: this song never gets old. It's one of my favorite songs on the album.<BR>2)Hunter: a really good song. She sounds really good here.<BR>3)Don't Think of Me: could have been a really big hit. She nails this song.<BR>4)My Lover's Gone: very cool song. I really like it.<BR>5)All You Want: worth the price of the CD alone. I like the little twist at the end.<BR>6)Thank You: this song was deservedly a big hit. Somehow I never got sick of it.<BR>7)Honestly OK: another really good song. <BR>8)Slide: I like this song a lot. It is very good.<BR>9)Isobel: she finds an interesting way to sing about a controversial topic. It's a good song.<BR>10)I'm No Angel: I like this song. It is a good song for her.<BR>11)My Life: one of my favorites. She sounds really good here.<BR>12)Take my Hand: another great song. It could have been a big hit.<br />You can't go wrong with this album. It is very good and it's about as good as debut albums get.
B0001WTWCO|3.0|Based on Michael Ondaatje's sweeping WWII novel, \\"The English Patient\\" is the story of a young Allied nurse, Hana (Juliette Binoche) who finds herself alone in an abandoned Italian monastery and tending to a mysterious burn victim (Ralph Fiennes).  Like David Lean's Dr. Zhivago, this mystical and epic film is told through a series of flash backs integrated with a subplot that is supposedly taking place in the present. During the flash backs we learn of the tragic circumstances that have led to the current state of the stranger. Fiennes is Count Laszlo, an archaeologist - and assumed Nazi sympathizer - who is in love with Katherine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). She, unfortunately, is married to the long suffering, dispassionate, Geoffrey (Colin Firth). The two are off gallivanting through the dessert in search of artifacts when the passionate relationship between the Count and Kate ignites. The resulting, all consuming, lust that overtakes these lovers is intricately balanced and compared to Hana's burgeoning romance with an East Indian soldier who defuses bombs, Lt. Kip Singh (Naveen Andrews). Willem Dafoe is brilliantly cast as Caravaggio - a man whose association with the allies (in a flash back) was exposed to the Nazis, the result being that Caravaggio had his thumbs brutally amputated with a switch blade. Caravaggio is determined to brutalize the man he believe is responsible for exposing his secret, the man he suspects is the burn victim lying helpless and dying in the monastery. Winner of nine Academy Awards \\"The English Patient\\" is a bittersweet love story between four people (two couples) who meet with untimely and destructive forces that ultimately alter the course of their lives forever. <br />THE TRANSFER:This disc was previously released as a flipper from Miramax in a non-anamorphic and somewhat grainy transfer. The previous disc suffered greatly from the intrusion of pixelization and edge enhancement. It also lacked anything in the way of extras. Forthe most part, these oversights have been corrected on this newly remastered 2-disc special edtion. The picture quality exhibits marginal improvements in both clarity and fidelity, due in large part to the fact that this time around the disc has been enhanced for widescreen televisions. Colors are rich, bold, vibrant but at times tend to be garishly unbalanced. Occasionally flesh tones may appear slightly on the pasty side. Otherwise, there is a deep, textured look to the visual presentation that is thoroughly in keeping with the subject matter. Contrast and black levels are bang on. Fine details are nicely realized. Pixelization still exists and sometimes breaks up finer background information. Also, certain scenes tend to look as though some edge effects have been added. Again, all these shortcomings are relatively minor for a picture that will surely not disappoint! The audio has been remastered to 5.1 and exhibits a very visceral and thrilling sonic experience. The sound of Count Laszlo's plane flying over the dunes is both aggressive and stirring and the musical score is wonderfully spread across all 5 channels. <br />EXTRAS: include a very comprehensive commentary by writer-director Anthony Minghella, producer Saul Zaentz and author, Michael Ondaatje. Minghella has more to say than the other two but all contribute fascinating tidbits to the production of the film and the inspiration for the novel. The deleted scenes segment is presented in a unique way - I won't ruin it for anyone but needless to say it's more refreshing than the treatment usually afforded deleted scenes. The CBC's documentary on the making of the film is somewhat of a disappointment, relying heavily on trailer junkets and very little but sound bytes from cast and crew. A series of featurettes round out the involvement of Zaentz, Minghella and production designer Stuart Craig.  There's also a nice series of interviews with the cast and crew and a great featurette on Phil Brady, the stills photographer. <br />BOTTOM LINE:The culmination of all this extra material and the rather impressive quality of the film transfer lead me to recommend \\"The English Patient\\" to all who love a good story and a thoroughly engrossing, great film.
B0000508U6|5.0|This album is one of the most relaxing, inspirational albums I've ever heard.  From the beautiful intro &quot;Don't Panic&quot; to the hopeful &quot;Everything's Not Lost,&quot; every song contributes to the amazing experience.  It gives an optimistic feeling without corny cliche lyrics or all happy, simple melodies.  Chris Martin's voice goes perfectly with the style of music.  &quot;A Rush Of Blood To The Head&quot; is another great album, but doesn't seem to have as many quality tracks.  I would still give it at least 4 stars, but it's not on the same level as &quot;Parachutes.&quot;  I would list the highlight tracks but I think every track is just as important as the one before it.  Even the 48 second title track has potential to be a great song.  Bottom line, go pick up &quot;Parachutes&quot; and if you like it, &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head.&quot;
B00000634J|5.0|WOW..just WOW! I dont know how to describe the genius of Lennon. First off, I wanna call myself new to Lennon's solo works. I bought this CD for &quot;Imagine&quot; and &quot;the hype&quot;. But only now I realize &quot;the hype = Brilliance&quot; of John Lennon. I am a young adult, who loves alternative and rock like so many other kids out there. I never thought I would buy into an old man music and his philosophies. But this is pure genius! This is the best mix of music and lyrics I have EVER heard. <br />Stand out tracks (although every track has its own merit):<BR>1. Imagine - THE BEST song ever written. The simplest of melodies with such relevant lyrics. <BR>2. Mother - I miss my mom now!<BR>3. Jealous Guy - Such a cool melody..a very sweet song.<BR>4. Cold Turkey - Rocks!<BR>5. Dream - My favorite track after Imagine.. Lennon shows his genius again in simple harmonies with such nice lyrics!<BR>6. Stand By Me - Really good acoustic track. <BR>7. Beautiful Boy - Really sweet song.<BR>8. Watching the wheels - About Lennon.<BR>9. Happy Xmas - The Best Christmas song. ever.<br />Well these are my fave tracks. Ofcourse, you will have yours! This album is a MUST buy for any music lover. This is the epitome of music. You can't get better melodies and lyrics for your money's worth.

B000005DQR|5.0|In 1996 Dj Shadow released the peak of his abilities releasing this album, Endtroducing to amazing reviews across the board. While Shadow threads the thin line between mainstream and underground, by using beats and samples from just about anywhere he can find them, whether it be movies, commercials, just about anything you can think of, it's here that he blends these elements into little storylines and in some way creates these mini movies of songs that are simply indescribable in their intensity, and have a genuine way of establishing a mood and a vibe that few artists can truly match. There is not a single weak song on this album, as each song seamlessly flows into the next, creating the illusion of euphoria and a heightened sense that what you are listening to is a sweeping revelation of what can be done with modern music in the hands of a true professional. Shadow truly shows what a producer  can and will do when allowed the ability to have free reign with their work, and do what they enjoy to do. Songs such as What Does Your Soul Look Like, are quite simply some of the most intricate and well done songs ever put on record in my opinion, and I truly consider this album to be one of the best albums ever made. Although Shadows later albums could never come close to meeting the expectations, that a followup to this album should garner, they still do a fine job of progressing Shadow as an artist and allowing him free reign and creative control of what he does. An amazing achievement no matter what kind of music you listen to, and one album that you should not be without. A true testament as to what can be done with the right records and imagination, buy it and love it, trust me.

0800141660|5.0|This is a wonderful movie with a wonderful cast and beautiful script.  I don't really know what else to say except that I absolutely adore this film.  Alan Rickman is superb as Colonel Brandon, I fall in love with him over and over again each time I watch this movie.  He's wonderful, as is Hugh Grant as Edward Ferrars.  Both characters are so likeable and real, they fit perfectly with their characters and make each viewing as enjoyable as the last.  Kate Winslet, as well, is one of my favorite actresses.  She fits so well in period pieces like this one.<br />This film is great whether or not you've read the book.  It's good all on it's own.  My only complaint is that I cannot picture Eleanor as only 19.  While I've always pictured her well above her years, I have a difficult time accepting her age in the film.  This is overlooked by Emma Thompson's brilliant portrayal of her.
B00004VYEO|5.0|Why should I buy Kurenay no buta on Amazon Canada? First of all becouse it is not in the catalogue of Amazon France. But why in France, or in Canada? Isn't it better to purchase such merchandise in Japan or Corea? There you can find the better anime DVD, so what can you find more in this store? There is something in the French version that the same Hayao Miyazaki thinks to be better than the one in the original version: the french track. As the Great Master Miyazaki himself says, the french actors perform even better than the japanese ones, and more, whose voice is the Great Kurenay no Buta? It's Jean Reno's! That's why every Miyazaki's fan forgets Japan, Corea, States and every other place and runs on french or canadian Amazon, full of hope. Please, I will try again and again. Fullfill our hopes.

It would be more appropriate for designers to come up with real patterns that solve real problems, not just follow patterns stated in this book, which are mostly over-kill or far away from real world. Can't understand why so many people gave it high ratings, and even more people talking about patterns with so much proud.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|For anyone who's been paying attention this is about the fourth or fifth DAWN release on DVD. First the original, then another version of the original, then the director's cut, then the DiviMax Special Edition...now this. Just like the Evil Dead series, they just keep on cranking out these \\"new limited edition\\"-style DVDs.<br />I don't mean to bash this DVD, I'm sure it will be good, but I question the companies that release new DVD versions of films every other month. It's usually low-budget horror flicks with huge cult followings.<br />Anyway...I paid $17.99 on the DiviMax edition and although I'm interested in buying this one, frankly, I feel a bit ripped off. I know I'm probably not alone when I say: STOP RELEASING MULTIPLE EDITIONS. Get it right the first time. Two versions, tops. Not five, six, seven, etc.

B0000CFW87|5.0|After begging and begging for months, I finally received Josh's album &quot;Closer&quot; for my birthday. I was not disappointed. In fact, his cd hasn't left my cd player since I first put it in. Right away, I knew I was in for a treat. The first track, &quot;Oceano&quot; took my breath away and made me cry. It is sung with such passion, such emotion, and through the depths of his rich baritone chords comes a longing not capable of being expressed by any other than Josh Groban's voice. He is rich, enchanting, melodic, and romantic in the songs &quot;Mi Mancherai,&quot; &quot;Si Volvieras a Mi,&quot; and &quot;Remember When it Rained&quot;. I honestly can't choose a favorite, because they are all sung with such feeling and passion. I have never heard a voice like this, and I have listened to many an &quot;artist&quot; who thinks they can sing. None surpasses the gloriousness and passion of this man's voice. It truly does feel like heaven on earth.<br />If you can, I highly recommend getting the Limited Edition version of the &quot;Closer&quot; cd. It has two bonus tracks (4 if you buy the Internet Only version) that are well worth the extra money, as well as a 20 minute &quot;behind the scenes&quot; DVD showing footage of different photo shoots and some questions and interviews. It also lets you see a little more into Josh's charming personality and proves that he is not a fake or pop star clone. This guy is original, one-of-a-kind, and I know he will be in the music scene for many years to come.<br />I am forever a Grobanite and I love you Josh!!!

B0001ZX0PG|1.0|i've learned my lesson...don't ever choose to see a movie based on academy award nominations...i watched this very painstakingly slow-paced movie anticipating an end that would give me that so-that's-what-everyone-was-raving-over, knock-me-over kinda feeling. instead after having to endure uncomfortable scenes (like watching sean penn painfully try to squeeze out a few tears on the day of his daughter's funeral) i was betrayed by a cop-out ending...let's sacrifice hopeless victims of abuse so 'normal' though moral-barren people can get on with their make-believe-together lives (i thought those days in film were over)! i was counting on director eastwood to deliver for some reason...to create a thought-provoking movie with a little depth and realism...to leave at least one character with some dignity...an ounce of decency...if not that, he shoulda had dave's wife (marcia gay harden's character) hunt down sean penn at the parade and waste him for making her a widowed single mother, and then shoot herself for not trusting her husband more and for not getting him the professional help he desperately needed all those years...now that 'River' would have been a little deeper...
1563890119|5.0|You can't begin to learn about the depth and intense storylines graphic novels conjure up without first paying homage to this, the granddaddy of them all.  \\"The Sandman\\" series, reinvented and reinterpreted by author Neil Gaiman, took an existing mediocre superhero and transformed him into an otherworldly god.  The success of the series is undeniable, and it has the unique additional factor of being equally interested to both men and women.  A rarity in comics, I assure you.  I had never really read any Sandman before, so I decided to begin at the very beginning.  With \\"Preludes and Nocturnes\\", you meet the hero of this series naked in a glass container.  My kind of show!<br /><br />With his siblings Death, Destiny, Despair, Desire and others, Dream is one of the Endless that rule at the edges of humanity.  In a makeshift ceremony, a cult attempting to capture Death herself find that they have instead captured Morpheus/ the King of Dreams/ the Sandman/ etc.  After 75 years, Dream finds a way to escape his captivity, only to find that things have gone horribly wrong in his absence.  Three of his tools in which he kept much of his magic have gone missing.  Worse still, his very kingdom has disintegrated.  To restore it, Dream much locate his items and defeat a villain that wants to use Dream's power to destroy humanity itself.<br /><br />Oh it's definitely a disturbing tale.  No question.  There are elements in this story that will haunt you long after you put the book down.  Oddly, Dream's visit to Hell is probably one of the tamer tales.  Still, it's well written.  There's nothing like a good quest tale to keep the reader wanting more.  The final chapter in this series introduces the reader to Death, Dream's somewhat punk rock sister.  Funny fact:  Death's a big fan of Mary Poppins.  Who knew?  Drawing in elements of everything from Alice in Wonderland to 1950s and 60s pop songs that discuss dreams, dreaming, and the sandman (of which I think there may have been roughly 4 billion) as well as Shakespeare, ancient Celtic myth, and even the original Cain and Abel story, Gaiman goes wild.  Remarkably, he does all of this and yet never looses his grip on the tale he's telling.  Things are never so wild that they get completely out of hand.<br /><br />The art in this book is created by the fingers of three meticulous artists.  Of them, I had a hard time deciding which I liked best.  I'm not an able reviewer of graphic artists, so I can't say who did which story and what style goes with whom.  What I can say is that as the stories continue, Dream himself grows and changes.  Though he retains his essential look, he goes from contemptuous to thin and drawn to Robert Smith.  The last story in the collection, \\"The Sound of Her Wings\\" is probably the weakest of the book.  While it's wonderful to see Death so perky and mischievous, I was disappointed by the story's hero suddenly looking so much like the lead singer of The Cure.  Instead of the Endless master of night and dreams, we have a pouting teenaged kid.  Go figure.<br /><br />Just the same, this is an excellent starter graphic novel.  For the person uncertain as to whether or not accept this art form as actual \\"literature\\" (and it's going to be many many years before this mindset becomes standard) this book may not convince them wholeheartedly, but it will at least give them something to think about.  A great dark tale with a great dark sexy hero.  No wonder the ladies like him so.billion) as well as Shakespeare, ancient Celtic myth, and even the original Cain and Abel story, Gaiman goes wild.

B00005JKCF|3.0|dont get me wrong,i l0ved this movie,but i noticed a LOT of errors from the comic book.89 to be exact.there were 30 alone pertaining to the time period in which the comic was set and the modern day movie complete with \\" julia roberts in a thong.\\"[as jjj put it}.most of the weopons and special powers were wrong also.the green goblins entire character from his costume right down to his mental problems were all messed up too.although mary jane was a hottie,she wasnt around until later because pete was with a blonde named gwen stacey who was killed during the brooklyn bridge scene. otherwise,the movie was excellent.it would have gotten more stars if not for the total abandonment of the comic book story.there are movies out there like sleepy hollow,which are excellent and people get fired up about a few minor changes and then this but now no one cares.ya got me.of the recently released mARVEL onslaught,i think nearly all of them except the first x-men were better than this one.another point that needs made is that there are a plethora of good characters/villians spidey spent a lot of time battling that could be a movie including.............hobgoblin,demogoblin,kraven the hunter-who buried him one time for weeks,the lizard,carnage,venom,the sandman,the rhino,electro,the shocker,the puma,the kingpin-yes the black guy whose really white from the daredevil movie,and many many more.hes been in teams,gang wars,fought aliens,battled symbiotes,had extreme cosmic powers,had villians form teams of 6 vand attack him that way.they say trilogy,i say never stop!
B0001BKAEY|4.0|Short review.<br />Started good, got worse, ended bad.<br />Don't bother telling me all the BS that the &quot;hardcore&quot; know about teh story. I read everything about the movie and YES I understand what happened at the end of the movie. It still doesn't change the fact that it sucked..<br />My opinion. Don't HINT to things that happen in a movie series, especially a trilogy, ESPECIALLY the END of a trilogy. You'll do nothing but try to look cool with the &quot;leet&quot; people, try to make the story more than it was, and piss off millions in the process...<br />This movie's end ruined the trilogy...
B000092ZYX|5.0|The latest Radiohead album, Hail To The Thief,  is actually a tricky one to review. While it can't be denied that it doesn't match their two classics, The Bends and OK Computer, it is still a piece of art that proves the genious of Radiohead and shows some real music in comparison to today's majority of acts who are either schematic, uninspired, silly, or absolutely devoid of any talent.<br />One thing I'll have to admit is that so far I have listened not to britpop or alternative rock, but to American alternative post-grunge metal or, if you will, to much-hated nu-metal. And it is noteworthy that Hail To The Thief was the album that showed me how wrong I was.<br />The secret of Radiohead's music lies, in my opinion, in its unexplaiable expression. It was of course present on The Bends and OK Computer, but, as the new album is considerably less melodic than both, it is one of the first things that attract the listener's attention and make him fall in love with the music. Radiohead's ability to express feelings or states of mind or to recall situations from life in their music is untopped. Tom Yorke's vocals and lyrics (on Hail To The Thief they are deliberately `childish' - just read the song titles - but it really helps settle the mood, making the album a slight medieval gothic flavour) suit the instrumental parts ingeniously well and alltogether they paint a wonderful atmosphere. <br />Some listeners say Hail To The Thief  hasn't got a topical unity as OK Computer did, but I have to disagree and point out that the feeling of doom, end, and inevitable danger can be seen in any of the album's 14 tracks, giving the album a universal, apocalypthic side that so far has been absent in the group's catalog. Tom Yorke explained that the main topic of the album, and the second title, is `the Gloaming', which means that bad times have come to people who were unaware, `not paying attention'. Just listen to the eponimous track and read the lyrics. I believe you'll get the feeling.<br />As to the musical side of Hail To The Thief, virtuosity and subtle, layered arrangements remain part of Radiohead's music like on previous releases and can be witnessed on every track. However, some songs include non-electronic instrumentation which is pleasant to hear and, although it is definitely not `coming back to the roots', it makes the album more adventurous and, yes, more fun. Rocking songs are followed by more electronic ones, or by piano-driven pieces that help the record avoid the occasional dullness of its two predecessors.<br />The songs themselves are versatile also, and offer different dynamic and tempo changes. While, as I mentioned before, they are perhaps not so melodic and instantly memorable as on The Bends and OK Computer, the songwriting has improved even further. As on Kid A and Amnesiac, Radiohead don't usually use traditional verse-chorus song structures and this only demonstrates their immense imagination. Perhaps the most catchy tunes are 2+2=5, There There, A Punchup At A Wedding and Where I End And You Begin. However, there are songs that show the group's ralents equally well, such as Go To Sleep, Myxomatosis and I Will which all paint emotional pictures that get stuck in your mind. The only song that drags a bit to me is We Suck Young Blood, but anyway it is supposed to capture the feeling of devil's coming which anyone can hardly like.<br />So the bottom line would be that this album is highly recommended to people who like either Radiohead themselves, today's alternative rock or simply atmospheric, emotional, expressive, beautiful music. One of the best bands in the world.
B00009Y3SA|1.0|Rob Schneider.  He's been a male prostitute, an animal, and even a woman.  But coming next summer, he's about to become something he's never been before!!  .......A male actor!!  Yes, that's right; a real live actor!  The title, you ask?  ...&quot;The Actor&quot;!  So original, we know!!!  Our hero starts off as a janitor and, get this, the viewer is treated to a number of urinal and various other bathroom scenes guaranteed to make you lose your lunch!  But wait, it only gets better!  Schneider then gets on a jet plane to visit his sick granny (played by Adam Sandler!) in the Big Apple, when a news crew that just happens to be in the area mistakes our hero for a famous and talented actor!  He then goes to star in various movies, falls in love with one of his screen partners (who suffers from Down Syndrome, but still acts nonetheless), and they live happily ever after!  So, what happened to the actor they've mistaken Schneider for?  Who cares?  Is there a plot somewhere in this one?  Nope!  Not important!  After all, when you get to see Schneider's face as he is kicked in the crotch numerous times throughout &quot;The Actor&quot;, who needs to develop any of those overrated things such as a story, characters, plot, climax, or resolution?  Says professional movie critic Roger Ebert of this upcoming movie, &quot;There were a couple of almost funny scenes in here!  I almost gave this movie a full star out of 4!  Highly recommended.....for our young male teens of 12 or 13 years of age, even though the film contains Schneider's exposed....behind.&quot;  Comming next summer to some random theater in Mexico......the only theater that would allow Schneider's face to appear in its vicinity.  So save your money kids, cause it's time to see Rob Schneider in a whole new light!........hahahahahahahahahahaha!  And when this movie does get released, remember this:  It's Rob Schneider, nuff said!
B000001TVD|5.0|It's been said before but when something is this incredible, its worth saying 1,000 times. The title for this album is the best electric guitar solo ever, case closed, period, etc. If the song Maggot Brain doesn't touch you in some way or move you at all then you are clinically dead and going to hell. For every person who has said &quot;I wish I could hear a solo that is like [Insert former favorite guitar solo] but...more better and stuff&quot;, then this is it. I know Jimi/Eddie comparisons are tired and incredibly over done (they're both black!!) but I'll go on record saying that this rivals and bests anything Jimi has ever done. <BR>Oh, yeah, the rest of the record is cool, too. George Clinton is the man.
B0001ZX0PG|2.0|Wow, this movie started great and had me thinkin who did it form the beginning. There was a great cast, and some great acting by Tim Robbins, but.....<br />WTF was up with the last 10 minutes??? It was like clicking the channel button on the remote....<BR>Right when Sean Penn's character starts to develop, and to learn something from his pathetic life....they throw the last scene in with his women telling him he's king....<br />sorry, but that scene and everything after it was completely lame, and should have been cut from the movie all together.<br />It disturbed me so much that I have to give it a 2, since I will never &quot;by choice&quot; see this movie again. It's too bad because up until then it was a good movie.
B000003TA4|5.0|&quot;Nevermind&quot; is one of the greatest albums of our time.  For any of you who are interested in what killed 80's Rock and infiltrated Alternative, listen to this album.  <br />Kurt Cobain's voice is scratchy but he uses it the rite way.  He is no better than an average guitarist, but the genre of &quot;grunge&quot; didn't rely on that.  Krist Novelsevic is one of the greatest bassists ever as well as Dave Grohl (Foo Fighters) on drums.  <br />The CD kicks off with the overly catchy &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;.  This is a heavy song that epitomises grunge.  Next is the loud rock song &quot;In Bloom&quot;.  Upon hearing this, you'll find yourself tapping out the drums with Dave.  Krist sets a great rhythm with his pulsing bass.  The third single of four is &quot;Come as You Are&quot;.  This is a bass heavy song that dwells on Kurt's &quot;take me for what I am&quot; thoughts.  The four song is the speed drumming, lyric slurring &quot;Breed&quot;.  The fifth song and final single is catchy &quot;Lithium&quot;.  A more up-tempo song on their alternative side.  You'll find this song stuck in your head.  The first acoustic song is favorite, &quot;Polly&quot;.  This is an anti-rape song magnifying Kurt's views.  Truly a great song.  &quot;Territorial Pissings&quot; is a punk song coming from the bands early influences.  You might as well look the lyrics up before you listen to it.  Track eight is a popular favorite &quot;Drain You&quot;.  This song illustrates the effects of love and hate.  &quot;Lounge Act&quot; starts off with a great bass strum into a poppy chorus.  Song ten is the screaming loud song &quot;Stay Away&quot;.  &quot;On a Plain&quot; follows as Kurt fills us in on his poor background and childhood.  Finally is the acoustic &quot;Something in the Way&quot;.  An extremely depressing ballad.  There is also a hidden track known as &quot;Endless Nameless&quot;.  This is the Nirvana old fans are used to.  This song draws a wide variety of opinionsbut I love it, it's just so LOUD!  <br />Every song on this CD is great.  If you like the heavier songs, listen to &quot;Incesticide&quot;(1992) or &quot;Bleach&quot; ((1989)no Dave Grohl).  This CD is more like &quot;In Utero&quot; (1993).  It was their mainstream debut and was widely coppied by other bands, STP, Toadies, and early Bush.  This is a fantastic record and I would die without it.
0671027387|5.0|I read this novel and as soon as I did, I couldn't put it down. It's a great page turning thriller that keeps you guessing until the end. It starts off with the find of a meteorite that contains extraterrestial life in it. It comes conviently as NASA is struggling with the overbudgeting and failed missions. Senator Sexton hoped to become president on the basis that he can use the extra money if NASA is moved to the private sector to fund public school education. His campaign collapses with the announcement and everything seems well until Rachael Sexton and the team of scientists uncover something very startling.<br />Without going into detail, they find that the meteorite was planted there and it could be fake. Soon, the Delta Force team abushes them and they almost die. They are rescued and soon go on a frantic race to uncover a conspiracy and get the information out before the delta force team finds them. As the story unfolds, you find out a lot about Senator Sexton and how there are many actions in his campaign that would cause huge scandals. You also find out about the cynical Marjorie Tench who is the senior advisor to the president and is very cunning and deceptive.<br />The story has a good blend of likeable and very hateable characters. You find out a lot about the characters and their past experiences that made them do certain things on the trip. There are many twists and turns as the conspiracies, the one about the meteorite and the things Senator Sexton is involved in, unfold. It is very hard to put down. I found it better than Angels and Demons in that it's much more suspenseful and a lot more intelligent. It's better than Da Vinci Code in that it doesn't try to convice people to join a pagan cult and the book is more suspenseful since there's a lot more at stake. It ended very well with the news unfolding in the way that it gets out without the bad guys winning.
0765310015|5.0|This series is the best I have read since Cook's Black Company, and Stackpole's Dragoncrown Cycle. To me it even compares favorably to the Fire and Ice series from Martin.<br />This isn't fantasy like somepeople are used to.  No one will spoon feed you the who is good and who is bad.  No one will devote 6 pages to describing a silk merchant.  You will have to actually read, not skim.<br />I ordered all 5 from the UK, and even after paying shipping, I don't regret the purchase one bit. If you can find these, PICK THEM UP!<br />Erikson is a major player in the fantasy field in my mind. He EASILY tops both Goodkind and Jordan for epic fantasy and is a serious challenger to the perpetually delayed Martin.
0385336810|5.0|WOW!!!! I Loved this book! I'm a fan of the Shopaholic series and thought I'd try this book out. I was Very pleasantly surprised. It took me a while to really start reading it because I was so busy, but then I had a day of nothingness and I picked it up and read the rest of it that day! I have to confess, I liked it more than Shopaholic!!
B00005JN8Z|5.0|Miklos Rozsa did a terrific job in composing the music for this movie. The great passion and emotion he can communicate is unsurpassed. In my opinion as a freelance composer it was very difficult to write the music for this tremendous film. It requiered a kind of kaleidoscopic character, each scene needed its own aura, its own color and unlike most filmscores it does not and it can not consist of short flimflams, each scene needed its own musical movement. <br />The most I like the `Christ is King` theme for choir wich is also sung by the matyrs in the arena. A song wich is unstoppable and will not die or fade away, it is the centerstone of the Quo Vadis´ musical climax.
B0002234LS|4.0|Interesting story and good acting. Sucks you in and spits you out at the end. A great watch overall.
B000006045|5.0|This is by far the best album ever released, not only by massive attack, but i'm talking about the best album ever released in the music world. angel, rising son, mezzanine, I couldn't stop listening, it crabs you and doesn't let you go until the last sound. it's just hypnotising. God, I wish I could listen the album for the first time again!!forget blue lines, this is the album you should get!
B0001ADAVK|3.0|Some parts of this movie are just plain boring. But I give it 3 stars because some parts are interesting.
0316168815|5.0|Amazing.  That's all I can say.  It was incredible how the author pulled off the narration being done by someone who is deceased in the real world.  AMAZING BOOK, and you won't be able to put it down.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|This movie was just plain interesting and fun to watch. Many surprising twists and turns. I highly recommend it for a nice Friday night rent, no, a buy. :)
B000000WJZ|3.0|I've had this album for like 5 years, and I still haven't finished listening to it.  I'm an alterno fan.  I don't go looking for alterno albums just so I can bash them.  But this Album is just too wierd to listen to.  Every song ends in a funky guitar solo, that manages to completely ruin the mood set by the rest of the song.  And everything sounds basically the same.  There seems to be a total lack of creativity here.  Any one of the songs could be called creative on it's own, but the CD as a whole is lacking.  Everyone seems to think that this is the ultimate CD, and that not liking it makes you evil.  Well then, I'm evil.  &quot;Today&quot; is really the only song worth listening to on it.  <BR>Now sure, if you're a super-fan of the Smashing Pumpkins, go buy this CD.  It is probably the best they've ever made.  But if you only kinda like them, don't bother.<BR>I give it 3 stars because I acknowlege the skill it took to write the songs.  Any of them could've succeeded as singles.  But they should of been split-up among other albums.  As is, the album is monotone.  But still not horrible.  If you want music by them thats not quite as funky, and more listenable go buy Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.
0312995423|2.0|If you think that you are going to get some intellectual stimulation from this book, don't bother.  The scenarios are very poorly coordinated with reality, and though some ex-NSA employees were consulted in the making of this book, I think that it was simply to gather some techno catch-words.  Nothing beyond that is real.  In fact, parts of the book were in very poor taste - It would have been rated R if it were a movie.  But if you can get past the absurdity of the technology aspects, it was a captivating story, though somewhat predictable.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|I still remember back in 1999 when I first heard sic. I fell in love with Slipknot. I've been a fan ever since. The self titled and Iowa were two of my favorite cd's ever. I worshiped this band. I even have mate feed kill repeat. Then They took their hiatus and corey started stone sour again and they castrated him. He's lost his charm. I had my hopes up that subliminal verses would be up there with the other releases. after trying and trying to get into these songs, I was let down. This album was majorly pussified. I hate it. there's only three songs on the cd I can stand. blister exists, 3 nill, and pulse. other than those, the rest of the album is crap. alot of posers and wannabes are going to be happy with this album. but true maggots would agree that slipknot owes us true metal fans a much improved volume 4. play something with balls!
B00008NRLX|5.0|I'm the type of person who'll listen to and enjoy just about any type of music.  Classical, Blues, Rock, Jazz, you name it, anything except (c)rap.   Lately I've drifted into Americana and being from the southwest I can find hoards of well established artists and numerous up and coming stars to pleasure my latest vice.  Yep, I thought I had most of the good stuff on the radar until I stumbled across the Jayhawks.   Where the hell have these guys been?   A long established band, I'd never even heard of and they are SO DAMN GOOD it's amazing they're apparently so obscure.   I first tried Hollywood Town Hall and it was nice, but not quite what I was looking for.   But after reading a few reviews on here, I decided to give them one more chance with this latest release - WOW!  Smooth harmonies, solid instrumentation and well phrased, flowing lyrics that speak volumes about whatever subject is at hand.    Take a little Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, throw in some Roy Orbison, a dash of Gram Parsons, pinch of early Eagles; mix it all around and then forget all that nonsense, cause these fellows have their own jam goin' on.   Rainy Day Music stands on it's oen ear, with it's own unique sound.    If you're into Americana, or for that matter, exceptional music of any kind, then run, do not walk to your nearest outlet and buy this CD, you won't be sorry.   You're welcome in advance.    And for more fantastic Americana/Country/Alt, etc. try out Tift Merritt - Bramble Rose; Mary Gauthier- Filth and Fire; Toni Price - Born to Be Blue.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Can't wait for the EXTENDED VERSION of Return of the KING! We already know how incredible the extended versions are of &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and &quot;The Twin Towers&quot;.  In December, the final extended version of the trilogy will be released, and just look how incredible it will be compared to the theaterical cut: <br />From THE DIGITAL BITS: &quot;In other DVD release news, Entertainment Weekly magazine posted a short blurb in their June 19th issue about what we can expect on the forthcoming The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King - Special Extended DVD Edition (which arrives in December - street date TBA). Look for the film to be a whopping 49 minute longer, complete with more than 300 new FX shots completed just for this release. Among the new scenes you'll see will be Gandalf facing down the Witch King at Minas Tirith, the Mouth of Sauron taunting Aragorn and company at the Black Gates, Aragorn tending to Eowyn at the House of Healing, and Gandalf's final confrontation with the wizard Saruman. You'll also get more audio commentaries from everyone involved, two discs worth of exclusive, in-depth documentaries and (we've heard) a pretty funny Easter egg or two. Look for the 4-disc set's faux leather slipcase to be blue. We'll post further details as they become available.&quot;<br />The directors extended versions are much more fullfilling and tell the story better than the theatrical cuts! I RECOMMEND THIS VERSION WHOLEHEARTEDLY over the theatrical cut!
B0002234LS|5.0|I just finished watching this movie and I though it was really good, I just love the plot and the ending is so confusing and great, just like Depp said the only thing important of a story is the ending and he was right.*****/*****  4.4/5
B00003CXCT|4.0|I do think that adding new special effects is a good thing.  Why can't George use new technology to 'improve' the look and feel of the older movies?  In the original Star Wars(EP IV), did you really like watching a fake plastic globe blow up with sparklers? Sure the orginal effects are sentimental, and mark that ERA in my mind when I was 9-10 years old when I first saw Star Wars. Not being able to recognize the movie as I saw it when I was 9-10 years old, has some impact, but not as great as the enjoyment I get when I see things like the extended assault on the Death Star in \\"A New Hope.\\" As our other fellow reviewer stated, \\"It's great to see the X-wings soaring around at break-neck speed like we always knew they could, and we get marvelous new angles of the Death Star's variated surface.\\" <br />The more important issues to me are the \\"Han Shoots First\\" and actually revising the movie.  Han wasn't always a good guy.  He was a smuggler that eventually 'came to the good side' at the end of EP IV... So revising the movie later makes no sense to me... As far as adding/improving/replacing the special effects: I miss some of the sentimental value of watching the older effects as a kid, but overall applaud that GEORGE LUCAS CARES about these movies and spends lots of money to 'improve' them.  He really doesn't have to do a lot of what he did, i.e., he is more concerned about telling his story than making more money.  I just wish the dialog in this movie was a little more involving!  I'm looking forward to purchasing this trilogy, however, I just hope episode III is more like episode V (The Empire Strikes Back).  Episode I and II were mediocre in my opinion.  THE CHARACTERS NEED MORE CHARACTER! Or BETTER SCRIPT/DIALOG!  Oh Well, Looking forward to this trilogy!
B00007FOMP|5.0|This is simply put the greatest body of work ever written for the public to enjoy, and yet to learn from too. He was not just writing for one person, he wrote this for all of us.<br />It stands alone in the music world, in high demand still, even after its 1971 release. Motown did not want this album, it was too volitile to release in 1969, so it sat for a year and a half.  Yet it revoloutionized music, it was an album, a concept album when America was into singles still.<BR>I am so glad they realized someone had to say what was said on this disc. To me this is a work of musical, and spirtual art. He is speaking of himself and of society, all in one beautiful musical journey.If you have never heard this work, listen to this disc, and listen with an open mind. <br />It is simply one the BEST musical compositions of all time. Timeless and powerful, a piece of love from a man who was so troubled in his own life. He gave us a message from God, a gift he could not ultimately find himself, peace and love.
0380799006|5.0|I love this book!  It is filled with practical advice complete with sketches of common arguements and how to respond.  I re-read a chapter every six months as problems arise.  You will refer to it again and again.  I give it as a \\"second baby\\" shower gift and have received RAVE reviews!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|My mom and I rented this movie because it was nominated for so many academy awards and expected it to actually be worthy of one.  Frankly, it was the worst movie that I have ever seen.  Both of us fell asleep in the process of watching it.<BR>I know there are quite a few people who actually liked this movie but I can not figure out why.  Some people say it was funny but the only thing mildly amusing in the movie was the scene about translating japanese to english.  There really was nothing else.<br />If you appreciate an artistic movie more than an entertaining one, you might like it but I highly suggest that you watch it before you consider buying it.<BR>Anyway, overall I felt that I could see this entire movie by watching people drink and smoke in a bar and then looking outside a hotel window.  It had considerably less than half the dialogue that a full-length movie should have and it really isn't that thrilling to watch someone stare at a T.V. or a bowl of nuts.  Also, the japanese karaoke was little less than scary.<BR>Make up your mind for yourself but DO NOT buy this movie based on Oscar nominations.
B00005YW4H|2.0|I don't understand why Norah Jones is so big and impressive.  She didn't even write her big hit &quot;Don't Know Why,&quot; yet garnished a lot of Grammys for it anyway!  In my opinion this girl is an overrated performer; Vanessa Carlton definitely should've walked away from the 2003 Grammys with Song of the Year for her very own penned &quot;A Thousand Miles;&quot; Avril Lavigne's &quot;Complicated&quot; hit was even a better choice than Jones's &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; tune.  I think Norah is talented but I think the pop market isn't her cup of tea.  Like I said already, folks - an overall boring listen.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|With time,this second album of Avril LaVigne's will spawn just as many hits as her 2002 debut,LET GO. I was surprised that this album is only 41 minutes in length. That's 8 minutes less than the first album. I only listened to it once since I bought it. But,it's great. Keep playing that punky music,white girl!
B0001UL7RY|3.0|Britney's dark rival Avril Lavigne was a &quot;Complicated&quot; girl when she hit charts with her best-selling punk/rock record Let Go.  Her new CD Under My Skin isn't nearly as a satisfying listen as most second albums seem to be (just look at Britney's Oops!...I Did It Again, which outdid its record-breaking debut).  I enjoy &quot;Take Me Away,&quot; &quot;Together,&quot; &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; and &quot;My Happy Ending.&quot;  I don't understand why people are so impressed with Lavigne's songwriting skills either; they're not that poetic like Jewel's songs, just like something a girl would write in her diary it seems.  Close, Avril, but no cigar.  Let Go is still your best release!  (Note: I like Avril Lavigne's first CD a lot, I'm not just saying I don't like her second because she's Avril and likes to diss my favorite living entertainer Britney Spears.)
0226264017|5.0|This is a foundation text that should be widely read and studied.  Whether you agree with Friedman or not is not the point.  These are ideas you need to actually consider and wrestle with.  If you end up disagreeing with him and can state why, you will be the stronger for it.  It is not enough to rail against them emotionally or call them lies.  They are not lies; they are ideas and arguments that ask for debate.  Personally, I have always been a fan of Friedman and am ever grateful that he stood against the tide of the postwar political movements with these powerful arguments for freedom.<br />People often caricature Friedman to their own discredit.  His arguments here are not simply that government is bad, but that using government is often a poor way to get at a desirable social end.  He certainly does not need me to speak for him, but if you think he is for huge corporations and letting the poor without help to fend for themselves, you misunderstand him and should read this work carefully.  Big corporations, he argues several places in this book, are the result of taxation schemes that encourage the retention and reinvestment of earnings that would otherwise have gone to the shareholders to reinvest as they see fit - in other enterprises, consumption, or charity (as well as in taxes).  This is only one example among many of popular prejudices against Friedman that do him real injustice.<br />The book is only a couple of hundred pages, is not hard to read, but does pay off the most dividends if you take your time reading it and consider what he has to say rather than jumping to conclusions without wrestling with your own thoughts (whether you agree with the author or not).  It was written in 1962, so some of the context of the book will require some understanding on the part of the reader.  It was a very different time than today.  However, the arguments remain solid and strong to the benefit of anyone who will spend time thinking about why they agree or disagree with this Nobel Laureate.<br />Oh, and he uses the word LIBERAL for his philosophy and explains the word in it classic sense rather than in the modern US re-definition of the word.with this Nobel Laureate.  <br />Oh, and he uses the word LIBERAL for his philosophy and explains the word in it classic sense rather than in the modern US re-definition of the word.
B00005OM4N|4.0|Britney Spears had made herself one of the most famous people in the world by the time of her third Jive Records release Britney.  With two hugely successful, Grammy-nominationated albums, Miss Spears was probably at the height of her career; then came Britney.  Britney's Britney broke records again (like ...Baby One More Time and Oops!...I Did It Again), but dropped in sales probably due to its more adult-themed tunes.  Though critically a darn good listen (like her two other CDs) the album Britney lacked the bubblegum-pop formula that had first made her famous in 1998.  The songs, five of which the singer had co-written, displayed a Britney nobody knew about: a darker, more outspoken girl, not the innocent Louisiana-born beauty she'd been on her previous records.  That said, that's not to say that Britney's Brit isn't a worthwhile listen.  Boasting three huge hits, &quot;I'm a Slave 4 U,&quot; &quot;Overprotected,&quot; and &quot;I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman,&quot; Britney's self-titled CD features tunes that are pop, but without the corn-yness of the early teen pop market promoted by herself and boybands like Nysnc and the Backstreet Boys.  Though not her most famous release, Britney is still a pretty good CD that's worth listening to.
1400032717|5.0|I just had a few comments on this unusual novel. Since other people have commented better than I on the story, I thought I'd say a little more about the main character and his condition.<br />This book reminded me of the recent movie &quot;Momento,&quot; where the protagonist has a severe memory deficit and sets out to solve the mystery of his wife's murder despite his impairment. This condition, known as anterograde amnesia, is rarer than the famous retrograde amnesia many people are familiar with from other films and novels, where the sufferer can't recall anything about his or her past. This condition was memorably portrayed in the 1965 Gregory Peck and Ingrid Bergmann movie, &quot;Mirage,&quot; and in Alfred Hitchcock's movie, &quot;Psycho.&quot; In this story, the main character has other impairments that impede his ability to cope but he must solve the mystery despite them.<br />In this story, Christopher Boone has Asperger's syndrome or a similar condition, and has trouble with anything involving social intelligence and interpersonal relations, although he's very intelligent in other ways and is gifted at math and logic. It is this ability that allows him to survive despite his other problems and to navigate the otherwise alien world of normal human relations and its complexities and strange pitfalls and problems, by focusing on his analytical strengths and avoiding his weaknesses.<br />Many years ago, I studied behavioral and neurological syndromes like this as a young neurogiologist in grad school, when it was thought that autistic and socially impaired children like Christopher behaved as they did because of various psychological problems such as the late Gregory Bateson's double-bind theory, which were often inappropriately blamed on the long-suffering parents. Now it's thought that autistic, Asperger's, and other similar children have neurological or developmental deficits resulting from the lack of communication between the parts of the brain involved in social intelligence and the other areas of the brain. One way this is thought to occur is through the demyelination of the corpus callosum, the main fiber bundle connecting the right and left hemispheres, or through the innapropriate pruning of white matter (the connecting fiber pathways) between the different areas of the brain, thus impairing overall communication and integration. Another possibility is that they have deficits in the areas relating to social intelligence themselves, which are located mainly in the temporal lobes. But the main point is that advances in neurology and neurobiology more and more support the theory that these syndromes are largely the result of biology than psychological and social factors and influences.<br />Well, I hope you didn't mind my little foray into some of the neurobiological science. As Christopher assumes the role of detective and goes about solving the crime (he is an admirer of Sherlock Holmes) and plumbs the mystery of the dog's murder, we get a glimpse of the world through his eyes, and we see how different, confusing, and frightening the world might be if we ourselves lacked the social abilities that most of us take for granted. Haddon has extensive experience working with these children, and he puts that knowledge to good use in this unique book, achieving a little fictional tour de force here by building an entire novel around such an unlikely protagonist.in social intelligence and the other areas of the brain.

B00005Y228|3.0|I bought this Kylie Minogue CD because I kinda liked her American breakout &quot;I Can't&quot;&quot; and expected a disco/pop album like that of her big single, but didn't really enjoy the record on a whole.  No great vocal talent except that of a karaoke queen in my opinion!  Britney Spears at least has a distinctive sound.  I like her new hit &quot;Slow&quot; from her latest release, but Minogue isn't that great.  She's yet another in the industry's actress-to-singer formula, like Jennifer Lopez and Hilary Duff.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I was reading some of the reviews and can't see how anyone could hate this album. It is completely different then Mer de Noms, but has a more mature sound. Simliar to the sound of Tool's &quot;Lateralus&quot;, but with a much more beautiful feel. <br />The Package 12/10 It is the best song on the album. It starts of really slow, but once it gets with it it is extremely powerful.<br />Weak and Powerless 9.5/10 I really didn't care for it at first, but it has really grown on me. <br />The Noose 8/10 Good song, but nothing special.<br />Blue 9/10 Takes some getting use to, but once you do it is a very beautiful song.<br />Vanshing 8/10 Another good song.<br />A Stranger 8.5/10 It is a great song.<br />The Outsider 9/10 Second single from cd and a excelent song too.<br />Crimes 2/10 Annoying, you will click the next button on this.<br />The Nurse Who Loved Me 9/10 Great song while many won't like it. It is a great drinking song.<br />Pet 10/10 This song was my original favorite on the cd before I got use to &quot;The Package&quot;.<br />Lullaby 7/10 Maynard son sings this sweet segway song. My only wish is that it was more upbeat.<br />Gravity 9/10 Hated this song at first, but it is one of those songs that sticks in your head and you can't get it out. It grow on me and I love it now.
B00005OAIE|3.0|John Mayer is a huge Dave Matthews-wannabe, and it's obvious in his voice and music prefs.  Overrated, though I do enjoy &quot;No Such Thing.&quot;
079284131X|4.0|When young Andy finally gets the doll of his dreams for his birthday, he doesn't know that his mother bought the doll from a peddler in the alley behind the department store where she worked.

No one believes Andy when he tells them the truth: &quot;Chucky did it&quot; Andy's doll turns out to be Charles Lee Ray, who moments before he died transferred his soul to the doll using voodoo. <br />When Chucky finds out he has been in the doll too long and is now turning human, he is told the only way to get out of the doll is to transfer his soul to the first person he told his true identity to, who is, you guessed it, Andy.<br />Now Andy and his mother must stop the notorious killer before he takes Andy's soul forever.<br />An edge of the seat thriller! This is the best one of the series.
0385493622|4.0|This is a bite-sized book that you'll definitely enjoy even if you don't know anything about mathematics. It's a good story told well. Don't expect much beyond that, though. You'll read it in a day and pass it on to a friend. But that's not a bad thing.
0783232039|5.0|Ten years after the notorious Lake Shore Strangler Charles Lee Ray was gunned down, his longtime girlfriend Tiffany gets ahold of his remains, rebuilds him (sort of) and brings him back to life in hopes of resuming their love affair.<br />But Chucky has other plans. He is more interested in transferring his soul to another human being. In a fit of rage, a heartbroken Tiffany locks him in a cage and buys Chucky a bride doll as a joke. Chucky takes this new doll, electocutes Tiffany in the bathtub and turns her into a pint sized little terror.<br />Together, they highjack a pair of unsuspecting newlyweds and take them hostage with plans to take over their bodies. Chucky and Tiffany end up resuming their romance with some of the most hilarious love scenes ever. (&quot;I am anatomically correct you know...&quot;)<br />A great horror/comedy!
0393317552|5.0|This excellent whirwind tour of world history gives the reader a whole new perspective on the world. By analyzing different historical trajectories of different peoples thousands of years past, Jared Diamond seeks to explain current inequalities in our political and geographic distributions.<br />The main cohesive argument tying this book together is that current social differences throughout the world are mainly due to historic developments of food production. Food production is the essential element which gave rise to large, dense societies, which in turn support writing, technology, religion and other elements of society that enabled the food producing peoples to displace hunter gatherer peoples. <br />Jared Diamond asserts that the differing rates and times of food production was due to differences in environmental and geographic factors and does not illustrate any differences in human abilities. Through this explanation, he seeks to discredit the racist explanations of world history. <br />Some of the most interesting points of this book was that of the importance of domesticated animals. I had no idea that our historic relationship with animals was so important to our current prosperity. There were more available local animals for domestication, which essentially enabled ancient peoples of the Eurasian continent to become the most powerful peoples around the globe. This was because it enhanced their ability to produce food and provided them with lethal germs. <br />Another interesting discussion point is why the Fertile Crescent was able to serve as the birthplace of agriculture but the people from this region were not the ones to sail to the Americas. The main reason is that this is a fragile environment that was logged and irrigated to the point of ecological failure. This can serve as a very important lesson that even though an area and a group of people may prove to be the most successful and powerful for a period of time, that is really just a snapshot inspace and can change. It also illustrates the importance of protecting the environment and working within given environmental constraints. <br />The discussion as to why Europe was the one to send explorers to conquer the New World rather than China was also a fascinating one. Jared Diamond points out that China has been tightly unified for such a long time, that it has actually worked against it at times. The decision of one ruler to stop ship building and exploration can stop the whole of China from that practice. Europe on the other hand, is driven by competition among neighboring states, which allowed Columbus to set sail after many failed attempts. Europe was successful because it was geographically separated enough to remain as several competing states, yet connected enough to allow for the easy exchange of ideas and technology. <br />In sum, this is a fascinating book that will expand and alter the way that you view the world. We should read this book in high school classes. Jared Diamond has given us a way to understand the current political and social divisions in our world without resorting to racist views. Everyone should read this to understand how intricately connected human society is to environmental and geographic influences.
B000069HK2|5.0|The Used! VERY GOOD HARD HITTING MUSIC THAT EVERYONE CAN ENJOY, GREAT BAND TO HAVE IN YOUR HOMETOWN
B00000JHAU|5.0|This was the first B&amp;S album that I bought and I love it. Tracks 1-7 are flawless and some of the best music you'll get to hear anywhere. Songs 8 and 9 aren't bad songs they just dont stick in your head like the previous do. The last track picks up where the first seven left off. All in all this album is fantastic and very fun to listen to. If you just like good music and great songwriting then pick this one up. There are a variety of intruments used and every song is worthwhile. If you're new to B&amp;S this is THE place to start. ENJOY!

0312983867|4.0|Even knowing how most of the characters would react, knowing that Stephanie would fantasize over Ranger and Morelli, knowing that her car would be destroyed and that Grandma Mazur would be obnoxiously witty and smarty - it was still a good read. <br />I loved the introduction of new characters and Kloughn is one of the best.The handcuffs act got old after a while but the dialogues, inner thoughts and comments made up for it. The scene with Ranger was great although she will probably end up with Morelli in the end.  The plot to this one was on the thin side but then everyone can't be an Elizabeth George.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|Because of it's low ratings I held off on watching this DVD until I just had some time to kill.  I was pleasantly surprized by the film.  I'm glad I finally saw it.<br />THE CONS<br />---------<br />Both the vampires and lycans seemed too human and not power enough.  The vampires don't seem to be able to fly or move very quickly or see in the dark.  The lycans seem to be more dangerous as humans than as wolves.  Both seem to need guns and special bullets to get by.<br />Neither genre seemed to carry the usual atmosphere.  Vampires are usually erotic while werewolves are usually portrayed as chaotic.<br />The film has so many twists and turns that in the end I didn't really care who lived and who died (except I did care about the human).<br />PROS<br />----<br />The dark sinister atmosphere of the photography is downright creepy.<br />I quickly stopped viewing this as a horror film and began seeing it as a &quot;who done it&quot;.  It is a good &quot;who done it&quot;.  It had me playing mental games as I watched each twist and turn.<br />The film had enough action to keep me intertained.<br />FINAL RESULTS<br />-------------<br />I'm glad I watched it, but I don't think I'll buy it.
B000004166|5.0|Arthur Grumiaux is, without a doubt, peerless in the Mozart violin field. Indeed, so good was his Mozart that the No.3 concerto virtually became &quot;his&quot;, and he used it in his -very successful- US debut.<br />  Similar in vibrancy and integrity to his Bach Sonatas and Partitas cycle, one feels that the Mozart presented here is how Mozart would have wanted it (if he had contemporary instruments under his disposal). The tone is uniformly pure, while the vibrato is sweet, but not overly so. Perhaps the key to playing Mozart is negotiating the deceptively difficult solo line with panache, while maintaining the classical sensibilities of this period (no mean feat, believe me). In this regard, Grumiax passes these tests with flying colors, stamping the piece with his own vision but never violating the Mozartean style.<br />  Grumiaux never sounds rushed or panicked. He is a veritable rock of Gibraltar in his rendition of these marvellous pieces, and it is a pleasure to hear him. To my mind, there is no finer version to ask for.
0743490304|5.0|Instead of doing a number of things I *should* have been doing, I decided to start the novel Deception Point by Dan Brown.  Bad mistake...  I couldn't put it down.  :-)<br />The main story revolves around a meteorite which has been found embedded in ice in the Arctic Circle.  Even more surprising is that it shows fossils of bug-like creatures that prove that there is extraterrestrial life.  This occurs on a political backdrop where NASA (who discovered the meteor using a high-tech satellite) is under fire to be privatized, and the president is taking a beating from his opponent during an election year for defending them.  The president sends an NSA intel agent up to confirm the finding and report back, and at first all seems as it appears.  But people start getting murdered and some facts surface that point to the meteor being a well-constructed hoax.  Meanwhile, the senator gunning for the president's job is riding a roller coaster of fate on his campaign as NASA's stock goes up and down.  He's being illegally financed by a group that wants to take over the agency, and their discovery of the meteor could spell the end of his political life.  All these plotlines (and a few others) coverge at the end to a final showdown with a few twists I didn't see coming...<br />This is probably one of the best recreational reads I've had of late.  The pacing was perfect.  It wasn't over-written, even though the book is 557 pages long.  I was actually interested through the whole thing.  While I had my misgivings about his other works like The Da Vinci Code, Brown writes an excellent techo-thriller.
B000092Q4U|5.0|Not quite as good as New American Gospel, but nonetheless a great album. If you are looking for music to enable you to beat the hell out of anyone, this CD is it. Randy Blythe's vocals are absolutely his own, no one else on earth sounds like this guy. He's definately possessed by some kind of evil force. The music is amazing once again also. This is some incredible metal right here. In a few words: BUY IT!
B000002P5W|5.0|Axis was originally released in 1968 and is the second of the three studio albums released in Hendrix's lifetime.  For my money Axis is the Experience at their peak.  Its better recorded than the debut &quot;Are You Experienced?&quot;.  The drums sound MUCH better and the guitar much more alive and richer in tone.  And Axis is less rambling, more focused and less broad in scope than &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot;.  The songs flow better than either of the other studio albums and both the recording and song writing are more consistant.  Not neccessarily better.  Its just that Axis is more unified in sound than Hendrix's other studio output.  It's his tightest and most psychedelic album.  Jimi and his engineer Eddie Kramer really got some facinating sounds in the studio and used phasing among other tricks to great effect.  Just check out the track list:  Its got the live staple &quot;Spanish Castle Magic&quot;, its got &quot;Little Wing&quot;, its got &quot;If Six Was Nine&quot; &quot;Im gonna wave my freak flag HIGH!&quot; Its got the jazzy soul of &quot;Up From the Skies&quot; and the metal edged funk of &quot;Aint No Telling&quot; to the acid tinged 4 minute pop symphony of the title song &quot;Bold As Love.&quot;  Not to mention the beautiful Dylanesque rocker &quot;Castles Made Of Sand.&quot;  It doesn't get any better than this. One of the true psychedelic albums of the sixties.  Just Beautiful.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|LOST IN TRANSLATION is a very unusual film. The relationship between Charlotte and Bob is more of a friendship than an affair, and it never falls into the typical cliches of Hollywood movies. Besides, Scarlett Johansson is the most beautiful actess in the world.
0375713751|5.0|This book is truly one of the funniest tales of a working mom yet...albeit to the \\"n-th degree\\", Kate Reddy sums up the ambition, guilt, passivity, aggression, levelheadedness, and disorganization that we all experience while trying to \\"have it all\\".  As a working mom-of-one myself with a second child on the way, I found this book to be a satirical look of what it might be like if everything in a working mom's life goes either extraordinarily well or extraordinarily badly!<br />If you keep in mind that this book is intended to amplify the successes as well as the failures that working moms face both personally and professionally, you'll likely see a little of yourself in every situation she goes through...from finding the time to actually cross items off of her ever-present \\"Must Remember\\" list, to confronting the nannny and chickening out, to overlooking an incompetent cleaning lady instead of expending the energy to find another one *right now*, to dealing with sexist comments in a male-dominated industry...you will come away with a finer understanding of all that you do that goes largely unappreciated.  <br />Taking that into acocunt, working moms will find this book and it's cynical tongue-in-cheek commentary a welcome change to the moms-that-have-it-all-and-do-it-well \\"fiction\\" available in the self-help section!

B00006BTCA|5.0|If you were to take the melancholy of a dreary winter day and attack a recording studio with four talented musicians inside, that would be descriptive of the tone. like so many people, I was drawn by both that tone and the rhythmical delivery of the music.  I honestly cannot complain about this album at all, but if I could, it would be that only a few of my friends own it, which is probably a good thing.  This album draws on isolation, feeds it, and manifests it into a larger form. the only exception to that is obstacle 2, but thats alright, it works fine in the context of the album, breaking up to slabs of great songwriting, hands away and stella was a diver....<br />lets see...the songs themselves.  untitled is undoubtedly one of the simplest songs on the album, but also one of the most effective in setting up the mood.  Obstacle 1 is a rocker with passionate vocals.  NYC is just shear slow beauty, and PDA is the obvious single.  say hello to the angels is kind of a funky little rock-out piece, and hands away is almost pure melancholy, but the build and the glorious climax is almost heavenly.  obstacle 2 (which was written first by the way) is another song that could be a single.  stella just gathers waves of beauty and melodies and combines it into one great sad song.  Roland is a simpleminded rocker, can't say too much about it except it is pretty fun.  The New and Leif Erikson end the album on a slower and more emotional note, and are brilliant songs.<br />Overall, my favorite songs are untitled, stella, and leif erikson, all of which are the more melancholic songs on the album.  However, do not let that fool you, every single song is great, and the album needs to be listened to as a whole to truly appreciate the beauty.<br />so buy this and have fun!

If I ever get my hands on Durst I'll put his face on ebay<br />   Every song they have is the same with terrible rapping vocals and the same swear word used consistantly.

B0000640S2|4.0|Where &quot;First Blood&quot; was a low-budget sleeper hit about a Vietnam vet still caught up in the nightmare, &quot;Rambo&quot; is a much larger and more elaborate fireworks display of an action film. Stallone's John Rambo is offered a potential pardon if he returns to Vietnam and brings back proof that there are still American soliders being held captive there. While there, he starts a one-man war against the sadistic Vietnamese soldiers and their Russian counterparts (led by everyone's favorite villian Steven Berkoff). &quot;Rambo&quot; is in may ways a marketable action vehicle for Stallone using patriotism as a good excuse to use every weapon imaginable to blow up everyone and everything in sight. While it does try to provide a message about the war and its importance, it is rather difficult to take this loud over-the-top live action toy commercial seriously as a &quot;message movie&quot;. As a fun piece of adrenaline-filled action, it does however do its job.
B00003CXPJ|1.0|In a word, innane.  In two words, sophomoric and stupid.  Don't bother.  Between over the top portrayals and no perceivable plot, this is a waste by any standard.
B0000DI7UR|2.0|At times it can truly be said that Stratovarius is nothing if not inconsistent. Since vocalist Timo Kotipelto joined the band in 1995 their craft has matured and earned them a place atop the power metal legions - and with good reason, as their best material is uplifting, atmospheric, and scalding in it's display of emotion and instrumentation. On the not-so-bright side of things, each album has been severely bogged down by very '*off* day' songs, serving as joyrides through ultra generic songwriting and recycled Euro-metal melodies. Dismaying as it is to say, Elements, Pt. 2 showcases itself as the best example of this imbalance in a Stratovarius album in years, in an utterly glaring way. To make things worse, on past Strato albums the aforementioned Kotipelto's voice could at least carry one through the filler with some entertainment with it's feel-based precision, and tasteful technique... - whereas, the complete opposite proves all too prelevant in Elements, Pt. 2. <BR>The opening song, Alpha &amp; Omega starts out with a decidedly non-traditional slow speed, and some interesting keyboard atmospheres, both of which seem exciting, at least, until the chorus breaks in. Timo Kotipelto has apparently sold his vocal spirit to the helium demon in exchange for a higher vocal range, and the results are disasterous - especially when utilizing the old argon gasses on a chorus melody as uninteresting as the one in the opening song. This is Stratovarius by the numbers, and forgetting to divide. And yet Alpha &amp; Omega is one of the best songs on the album, because of the few things it does do right. Blithering frustration is imminent, but nothing compared to the music ahead.<BR>The album's first single, I Walk To My Own Song, is next, and could be considered one of the 'standouts' on Elements 2 as well - mainly thanks to the smoking solo section by guitarist Timo Tolkki that jumps out and commands the metal horns be thrown. But mashed on either side of the burst of qualityis the band playing by an average of 1/3 of their own rules and mixing every piece of bland one usually expects from a 'single' into the song, topped off by Kotipelto's strep-throat wailing. <BR>I'm Still Alive follows, opening with a great riff..and then morphing into a [insert random fast Stratovarius song here] part 2, but without the magic touch. Hopes grow high that this band could still pull off being inspirational with the fast-power-metal-anthem motif, but unfortunately Kotipelto's helium induced vocals carrying bland choruses over predictable song structuring leave more than a mild disappointment.     <BR>Seasons of Faith's Perfection continues the trend of a very promising beginning, but the band once again falls into one of their own niches - this time it being the Stratovarius-slow-song-machine if you will - and once again, this time around it fails to break through with any more then potential passion. The almost eerie keyboards and acoustic guitar work are excellent, and on the other side of the coin, the chorus is indistinguishable from any other standard Euro-metal ballad. <br />The entire album continues at this unbearable, snail-in-molasses pace, delivering all-too predictable songs in every category (a few slow songs, the fun fast songs, the mid paced anthems, et al) with an infuriatingly teasing spoonful of shimmering good ideas scattered randomly on top - and don't forget about Kotipelto singing higher than he should and can, and losing his once great power. Lyrically Elements, Pt. 2 is Strato's standard odd mix of Christian and new age ideas, but on the positive, the Christian influence is bolder and even pokes through as inspirational once in a while, such as in Know the Difference, which quotes part of a popular prayer (if some prayer is to be contained in such a way), the Serenity prayer originally credited to Reinhold Niebuhr. Aside from instances in the same general field (which can also be found in Alpha &amp; Omega), and an almost pretty good song in the beautifully atmospheric Luminous, there isn't much more truly memorable or exciting about Elements, Pt. 2. There are many things Stratovarius does well with their music, and generic is definitely the opposite and undoing of them all.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|All my friends, and even some adults, agree this is one great CD! I live in a trailer park, but it's not a joke, it's a nice one (we have a double wide!), and everyone here loves this CD. You can hear it playing at one or another trailer almost constantly. This is to say that there are lots of average people like me who don't fall for the Britney-bashing and really LISTEN to her music, and to this CD.  I got the chance to see her in concert and she was awesome.  She has the looks, the talent, and the dance moves, so what's not to like? <br />If you like good music, try this CD!!
B000001FTD|5.0|This is another fine release from one of New York's reigning thrash metal bands. This is probably my favorite album ever by Anthrax. The album cover is just amazing (Even though I can't get it for the life of me). The sound of the guitars and the singing totally rocks, and the lyrics are cool, too. 'I Am The Law' is about a fanatical cop, 'Indians' is about the plight of the American indian, and I really like the line in 'Imitation Of Life' &quot;Bands dress like women all lipstick and lace! I'd pass and image law, stick it right in their face!&quot; This is one of the best thrash albums ever, and believe me when I say there are a lot of good thrash albums.
B000021YQV|5.0|Most people wouldn't call Toxicity Heavy Metal, because it certainly doesn't sound like it. But if you like Metal, Power Rock, any kind of Rock (except for light rock) then you will like System of a Down's Toxicity.<br />Prison Song: 91/100<BR>-This song is louder than most songs on this album, and it is hilarious. \\"I buy my crack, I smack my bitch right here in hollywood!\\" It's a very political song.<br />Needles: 87/100<BR>-A very funny song, about a tapeworm controlling him. Listen closer: it's actually about Heroine. Very good song, but it can be a little loud.<br />Deer Dance: 100/100<BR>-Probably the best song on this album. Another political song. This has a great chorus and a fantastic beat, you should buy the album just for this song.<br />Jet Pilot: 88/100<BR>-The chorus is pretty good, and this song has a fantastic beat (most SOAD songs do), but it is very loud, and it is repetitive.<br />X: 88/100<BR>-This is the most repetitive song on the album, and one of the shortest too, clocking under 2 minutes. It has a nice beat, and nice vocals.<br />Chop Suey!: 95/100<BR>-Most of you probably heard this song already. And yes, it is fantastic. Probably one of the best on the whole album. go to WWW.SYSTEMOFADOWN.COM to watch the video: you'll get a kick outta it.<br />Bounce: 72/100<BR>-This is not that good of a song. It's just plain stupid. BOUNCE! POGO POGO POGO! But it is funny if you listen. It isn't worth more than 2 listens.<br />Forest: 74/100<BR>-Like Bounce, this song is stupid. \\"WALK WITH ME MY LITTLE FRIEND!!!\\" Pretty much avoid this song as well. But the beat is great.<br />Atwa: 81/100<BR>-This song is very emotional, and one of the lighter songs on the album. I like it, but it's far from the best track.<br />Science: 76/100<BR>-The album starts getting stupid.<br />Shimmy: 76/100<BR>-What is this sh*t?<br />Toxicity: 69/100<BR>-This was supposed to be one of the best tracks on the album, yet it ends up being the worst.<br />Psycho: 69/100<BR>-A little above Toxicity. \\"PSYCHO! GROUPIE! COCAINE! CRAZY!\\" Constant yelling about those words.<br />Aerials: 85/100<BR>-This is a great escape from the mediocre songs before it. It's great! This track is absolutely flawless, except for the last 2 and a half or so minutes: it's all music! Jungle music.<br />OVERALL: I'm not adding all of that.<br />This is a fantastic album, my favorite! System of a Down is cool, and I can't wait for their fourth album in December.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|Now this is what I call a movie. The other movies are really really good, but the epic saga a humans vs. machines comes to a dramatic and unbelievable close. Neo is unconcious in the real world, in a subway station that runs from Zion to the Matrix. As he makes his way to the dark and frightening Machine City, with lots of blasting tentacled robots and explosions, the saga reaches a conclusion: The fate of both races rest sqaurely on Neo's shoulders, and he must strike a bargain in order to save the planet from total annihlation. This is the best movie ever made and Keanu Reeves is just amazing in this.
B00005BL2A|3.0|I have actually rated this album with 4 stars, but somehow the site changed it to 3 and doesn't allow me to correct it anymore. Anyway, to the review.    I have mixed feelings about this album. I mean, the lyrics are there, the songs are great, the melodies are Depeche Mode through and through, while Dave delivers a wonderful vocal performance. Still, there's this little catch.    I have all Depeche Mode albums, and Exciter is the only one that took quite some time to really grow on me. I think the problem lies in what a previous reviewer mentioned: the repetition of an assortment of clicks and little noises that, to me, can be a bit grating at times. Don't get me wrong: the songs are truly great, they grow on you; the problem is that I am not totally comfortable with the arrangements chosen to accompany the lyrics and the melodies, and this detracts a bit from my overall enjoyment of Exciter.    Bottom line: Exciter is certainly not my favorite Depeche Mode album, but I like it fine (although it took longer to grow on me than previous DM albums). I also don't think it is a step backwards for Depeche Mode. It is perfect for a quiet, relaxing listen. I am only a little uncomfortable with the arrangements, but the rest is top-notch, as usual with DM.
B000005RNQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite heavy metal albums...ever. Saxon were a fist-pumping, headbanging heavy metal band from Britain. They never really hit it big in America, like most of the NWOBHM bands, but attained a large following in England. I feel this band is terribly underrated, and this album is one of the best albums of the early eighties. The title track is a true headbanger's anthem, which gives homage to the club beginnings of Saxon themselves. This is one of those headbanger's albums that will always live strong in the hearts of metalheads, even though they were not a commercial success.
B00005JM1F|1.0|I'm a fan of Will Ferrell &amp; was fully expecting to like this movie. Wrong! I suppose that if I were a teenage boy or a miserably unhappy married male, I would have enjoyed it, but no such luck. What a waste of time and money : (
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road is one of those rare masterpiece albums ever produced by a rock band and we all are better off for it. Despite the fact the The Beatles were beginning to go their own ways the CD reflects the strength of their creativity. There is the deeply moving ballad \\"Something\\" by George Harrison as well as the darkly comedic song \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer.\\" The song \\"Octopus's Garden\\" by Ringo is fun and very catchy at the same time. (Yes, it can be enjoyed by both children and adults!)<br />The Beatles were always interested in getting as much of the spotlight on themselves as they could; and this album contains many examples of that. For instance, if you listen very closely you will hear Paul McCartney start out singing \\"Oh! Darling\\" in the song of the same name; but by the end of the song he has sung \\"Oh! Johnny\\" at least once or twice in what the group meant to be a sign of Paul's calling out for John not to leave the band or fight with the other band members. The cover is another example of The Beatles trying hard to get all the attention focused on them (they deserved it, though GRIN). Rumors were swirling: this was no photograph of the Fab Four crossing the street named Abbey Road in England! Instead it was a picture of Paul McCartney's funeral! John and Ringo walked in front, representing the church and the religious ceremony that might have been if (God forbid) McCartney had in fact died. Then walked McCartney himself, his hair unkempt and a cigarette in his hand; this and his being barefoot represented that his body was ready for heaven. At the end of the line walked Harrison, not dressed as well as the others since he was rumored to be the gravedigger for Paul's grave.<br />Their strategy worked! It did help focus the public eye on The Beatles-stealing attention, of course, from competing bands such as The Rolling Stones.<br />Then comes the numerous special extras this album has to offer. Because The Beatles were winding down they had numerous snippets of songs that they had intended to flesh out but never did. Thus the group was smart enough to release these snippets on this album-and the bits and pieces of songs such as \\"Polythene Pam\\" and \\"She came in through the Bathroom Window\\" are expertly arranged and ordered on this CD.<br />I only wish there had been some liner notes with this CD. Nevertheless, any Beatles fan must have this album for its very high value as both quality entertainment and an excellent record of their self-marketing skill.songs that they had intended to flesh out but never did.

B00008CLOA|5.0|To think that its over 30 years( heavy sigh from this old man) since this album came out and I am still heavily touched inwardly sometimes to the point of tears by the soulfull &quot;Great Gig In The Sky&quot; <BR>  This album would take anybody with any heart, be they a happy upbeat person or a shy reserved one and toss their feelings on a stormy ocean of sound that will carry their emotions up and down constantly, sometimes violently,  sometimes smoothly.<BR>  Despite the naysayers this album will always shine in the pantheon of musical genius which as even now my daughter, 9 years old and sharp as a razor, and I have our Pink Floyd together time and she learns what great music could be without the pablum they foist on us disguised as talent.

B000002MP2|1.0|the downfall of real/street punk, that is. This is when Green Day &quot;sold out&quot;, but they were never realy punk, they and their friends at clubs had a skewed version of what punk is. They think it is about spreading peace or some sissy stuff like that, and it is not, Anarchy is the opposite of peace, it is unadulterated freedom, real, true, freedom to do whatever you want. And punk music should be noisey and aggressive.  This is one of those bands(the leader, in fact) that made people think this poppy crap is punk, and almost completely killed  real punk rock.  If it wasn't for bands like the Casualties, punk would truely be dead, but it isn't dead, and won't die.  Punk is back and it's here to stay! I HATE GREEN DAY, BUT AT LEAST THAT SISSY SONG ISN'T ON THIS!
B000069HK2|5.0|The Used is a band that is unlike any other that I have ever heard before. They combine your average punk with a more rockier style, and then have a great singer that is a mixture of bolth. The first 3 singles &quot;Buried Myself Alive&quot;, &quot;Taste of Ink&quot;, and &quot;Blue and Yellow&quot; are very good, and if you've enjoyed them there are much more like that on the album. The band screams alot and has more deeper lyrics then you will find in other punk rock bands. It's music that you can listen to often and still have it sound great everytime. Even if you don't like punk rock, I still would give this band a chance, because in reality they are more alternitive then punky. I have freinds that like Stone Sour and still like this band. The drumming in the songs are really good and so is the guitair. The songs are really catcy and easy to comprehend. If you like the band (Senses Fail) you proboly will like The Used. They sound similar only The Used dosen't sing about eating out peoples hearts. The musics really enjoyable as well, and I hope that you'll like this band as much as I did. I cant wait untill their new album comes out and also when the Projekt Revoluton Tour comes to town.
B0002BO0AS|5.0|I read a review thats says this album isnt as good as their first album.Whoever wrote that review doesent know what he is talking about.Dont get me wrong stings....does kick ass,but this cd is sooooo much better.The breakdowns are more complex,the double bass is alot better(since they picked up a new drummer since first album)and the vocals are more impressive.If you like ANY metal go buy this album now.I now you wont be dissapointed.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|That Hollywood was still capable of producing a film that didn't make you feel like you were watching something geared toward the severely DUMB or people who enjoy watching the same plot decorated with different actors over and over again. This film was a big surprise to me as I went in expecting the usual Hollywood action film which is people hitting people with swords followed by an extremely stupid CGI effect of the body flying 300 feet into the air for no reason at all and dumb people in the audience going YO DAWG DAT BAD (and they are incredibly Caucasian with VISORS or MULLETS). However I got a seriously well directed and possibly only realistic film about ye ole Pirate times about a British warship chasing down a French warship and all the blah blah in between.<br />  The attention to detail of how the things went about on a ship is incredible and pretty much is the story. The floggings and deck scrubbings and primitive surgery and bad hygiene are all shown in their filthy glory however the film feels a bit wee bit restrained in most of the details which is strange as there is no reason why this film had to be rated PG-13 as no one under 20 (I am 20 myself) this day and age really cares about well made films as this is anything but a film for the whole family designed to rake in easy Box Office cash so I'm guessing the director believes himself to have GOOD TASTE (pray he never see Troma's Terror Firmer, which isn't too far off from authentic sea life of old days). Also though I'm not that familiar with the books the film is based on the two main characters seem incredibly TOO morally perfect especially in a time when the worst place on earth to be was a British Naval ship, a mutiny is suggested in the film and the way it builds up is very believable but the way everyone backs down is kind of cheesy and unrealistic, zap the situation into reality Russel Crowe would be tossed into the ocean and pelted with feces, however RUSSEL CROWE & THE WHITE MAN'S LAW SHALL CONQUER AND MAKE EARTH PURE!<br />  ANYWAYS! All this aside this is a splendid film to watch that takes it time with story and characters, and blows your eyes out of their sockets with realistic action scenes I haven't seen in a LONG time. Just say, if you liked Bridge Over River Kwai you'll love this, as both films have nothing in common except great film making that is rarely seen in the mainstream these days.CONQUER AND MAKE EARTH PURE!<BR>  ANYWAYS!

B000059MEK|3.0|Daft Punk are clearly talented, ever since the irristbly infectious 'Homework' album they have quite rightfully taken their place among the dancehall/electronica elite. Suffice to say, their latest offering 'Discovery' does not disappoint. The album kicks off with the now classic 'one more time' incorporating a flowing beat with great computed generated vocals (like that's a suprise!) this is followed up by the sublime 'aerodynamics' with its powerfull electro-guitar solo. The sound quality does not decrease as we are then presented with the already well known 'Digital Love'- this is a fanatstic track with a very clever vocal floating accross a tinny, yet head nodding beat. The proceeding track 'Harder, Better, Stronger, Faster' is by far and away the best song on the album, the song consists of three main parts - each more funkier than the last - the beats are excellent and our computerised protaganist is, well...damn funky!<BR>Unfortunately after this point the quality detriorates...rapidly, the few highlights remaining include 'Too Long'and 'Cescendolls' although if you are not an avid fan these are certainly nothing to get excited about - especially when they are found alongside abominations such as the pathetic 'night vision'or the charmless 'face to face'- overall accomplished, enjoyable but ultimately flawed.
B00005JL3A|4.0|\\"I shot her five times,<BR>How was she still standing?<BR>(rapid machine gun fire) B---- Isn't standing now.\\"\\"<br />\\"This is Going to slow us down.\\"<br />Resident Evil: Based on the super popular video games of the same name.<br />Basic plot, OH Geeeze Meathead don't spoil it for the rest of us who might want to see it. Players of the Resident Evil series of video games will recognise many of the scenes and plot elements. I didn't becuase I haven't played the games except maybe the first or second one once or twice (whichever one starts outside the mansion). OK so without giving too much away, a deadly virus breaks out in a super secret experimental laboratory complex that is controled by a supercomputer Named \\"The Red Queen\\" that has gone out-of-control so the powers that be send in the marines so to speak (a special forces type paramilitary unit). Meanwhile the main character Alice played by Jovovich has amnesia, a side effect of nerve gas released by the Red Queen, and slowly regains her memory as events unfold. Yes there are intentional parralels to Louis Carols Alice In Wonderland. I enjoyed this movie although you do have to turn off your brain as with most other movies of this genre. An interesting bit of trivia is that Night of the Living Dead (1968) Director George A. Romero, was originally on board to write and direct, but left the project due to creative differences over the script. The sound is typical Sci-fi, Horror, suspense heavy metal type music scored by Marco Beltrami and get this Marilyn Manson. Oddly enough despite that bizarre match up the music works. As for the plot etc... The result is something like Demon Seed meets Night of The Living Dead, meets Lara Croft - Tomb Raider with a little Total Recall and Raiders of The Lost Ark thrown in. I liked one scene which according to Internet Movie Data Base was inspired by and is very similar to a scene in the Canadian movie The Cube. My entertainment dollar was well spent even with the slightly cheesy CGI effects and occasional cheap Zombie makeup mixed with just plain gory Zombie makeup. BTW they don't ever call the undead creatures Zombies, they usually refer to them as the monsters or creatures or things, wouldn't you?<br />The Quality is very good overall so out of 5 stars or discs or thumbs or whatever you wants. I give Resident Evil a 4 for the sound and the picture quality a 4.5
B000060P79|5.0|Personally, I love Simple Plan and I feel that this is a great album. It's very happy and upbeat. This album offers you a variety of different, enjoyable sounds. Simple Plan is not as &quot;punk&quot; as Reset was. I loved Reset and now I love SP even more. So the new sound is a good thing. I can't wait until their new album comes out! All the Simple Plan stuff is good so go out and get it NOW!!! I also recommend their DVD &quot;A Big Package For You&quot;. This is an awesome DVD and it really helps you to get to know the guys. To sum up, buy everything even remotely related to SP, listen to their music, and spread the word of what a great band they are. Why should you do this? <BR>1) Cause they are awesome musicians who deserve to be recognized for their talent.<BR>2) They can really rock out.<BR>3) They're from CANADA and that makes me proud.<BR>4) They are REALLY actual cool guys.<BR>5) If you're a gal (or... um like guys)the members are really hot! But jus remember that I claim Pierre!!!<BR>6) They care about the music and not just the fame. ISN'T THIS A NICE CHANGE!!!<br />SO GET THIS CD AND EVERYTHING ELSE SIMPLE PLAN RIGHT NOW!!! <br />*and could ppl stop making bad reviews about these guys cause you guys suck and are obviously deaf cause you can't hear how great these guys are. I despise the HATERS and if you don't have anything nice to say then shut up!! Cause no one's listening.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|It just so happened that this is the first movie I saw after surviving the bloated, pretentious, and interminable, Magnolia; and, by comparison, Donnie Darko was like a breath of fresh air. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. In addition to the palpably dark and eerie atmosphere that pervades the whole movie, it is one of the more accurate depictions of &quot;teen angst&quot; ever committed to film; and, as a period piece, it also manages to be a very effective depiction of life in those crazy 1980's. This film is a great example of how the budget of a film can often be inversely proportionate to its quality, especially in &quot;Hollywood:&quot; it is better than most films with 30 times its budget. The special features on the DVD are very worthwhile (for once) as well. If you enjoy the movie, I recommend that you take the time to watch the extended and deleted scenes: there are a few, that you might even feel, could've been left in; although you may just admire Richard Kelly's efforts to keep the finished film at around two hours, as the editing never allowed this movie to &quot;drag&quot; (perhaps he felt, as do I, that beyond the two hour mark most films seem to collapse under their own weight). A second viewing of the movie with the audio commentary by Jake Gyllenhaal and Richard Kelly is also very worthwhile. Although the director considers this a sci-fi movie, it comes across as more of a supernatural/psychological thriller, and an intelligent one to boot. Also, as many people have commented, the casting and performances are inspired. The darkly ambient soundtrack is brilliant, as well (even without the pop songs that were too expensive to license for the OST album), and the creepy cover of Tears for Fears' Mad World is just amazing in the context of the film. Also, I'm not much of a Drew Barrymore fan, but praise should go to her for championing this project as an executive producer, and for providing an interesting portrayal of a progressiveand idealistic young teacher trying to bring some enlightenment to a conservative private school.<br />I haven't seen a movie that was such a &quot;complete package&quot; (great script, directing, casting, acting, editing, lighting, soundtrack, sets; effective-but-not-overblown special fx, etc.) in a LONG time. One final note: if you have heard about the &quot;demonic bunny thing&quot; prior to seeing this movie, and are put off by it--as, initially, was I--you needn't worry: far from coming off as silly, the &quot;bunny&quot; just adds another dimension of creepiness to this movie.
B00006879E|5.0|I absolutely agree with the previous review...i'm actually very picky when it comes to music albums but this album was just outrageously beautiful..full of energy and emotions and it's so unique and vibrant...it's hard not to love any of the songs...and I think actually people fixed on different types of genres tend to enjoy this because it's &quot;different&quot; so get your hands on it NOW if you already haven't done so!
B00005221M|5.0|The movie has the same title as James Fenimore Cooper's novel, but about the only elements that are the same would be the French and Indian War setting and the names of the characters. But don't be disappointed! This is one gripping movie.<BR>There are many, many powerful scenes.
B000005JA8|5.0|Hey!<br />This album is brilliant, but it takes a lot of patience and an open mind to appreciate it. For those who don't like it, you must come to realize that you don't understand it. Hopefully someday you will understand it. Until then, please don't slander the work. There are  a lot of bands out there today who have created a hardcore style based off of this album. The influence (whether they know it or not) is unmistakable in bands like HELLA, DILINGER ESCAPE PLAN, VOLTA DO MAR etc...<br />For those that think this album is random noise, try starting with tracks like &quot;The dust blows forward and the dust blows back&quot;<BR>or &quot;Orange claw hammer&quot; <BR>-they are unaccompanied vocal tracks (and some of the best poetry of the 20th century)<br />And if you think that two saxophones played simultaneously can amount to nothing but nonsense (Mr. reviewer from the BRONX, NY)<BR>Check out Roland Kirk from YOUR hometown of New York who could not only play up to THREE saxes simultaneously.......WITH SOUL, but ripped at them!!
B0001MDP3G|4.0|This is a good movie i can easily see this being nominated and winning best picture of the year. It has a great ending that concludes the whole movie and sets things right.  This film is about a young confederate (enmond) played by jude law falls nfor a young lady ada played by nicole kidman. when she is visting her father in the small north carolina town Cold Mountain. He doesnt spenmd too much time with ada before everyone is drafted out into the civil war. He really doesnt want to leave her but he has to. He gets severly injured in a battle of teh trenches and almost dies and then he realizes he cant die without seeing his love ada again.Well back in Cold mountain ada hires ruby played by renae zellweger who is a country girl that knows how to farm and becomes good friends with ada. But enmond has to go through a long perilous journey to try to get back to ada and who knows who he will run into and how will he evoid the yankees plus the watcher who look for runaways and they kill any of them they can find.So will enmond ever reach ada again? Will enmond even survive the journey home to Cold Mountain? Will ada be able to take the long wait for her love enmond to come home ? its a Great movie. At first it is a little slow taht is why im only giving it a 4 star but after about 30 minutes into the movie it all starts coming together an becomes a great tale and also a great novel it is .  This is defenately worthy of watching
B0002BO0AS|5.0|Finally, after 5 months of searching, I finally get my hands on an Unearth cd.  Most cd's take awhile to become memorable in your head, agreed?  Well, here's the deal with &quot;The Oncoming Storm.&quot;  I've only listened to it once the whole way through, on the way to work.  I can already remember alot of the cd because its that good.  Unearth does what every generic HxC/MxC band can't figure out how to do or won't do.  And thats add variety.  The breakdowns are very memorable, the vocals are very nice.  With half singing/half screaming, full out screaming, and even a few parts with clean vocals.  The double bass is also pretty unique at parts, with a bridge consisting of only the double bass for about 45 seconds on track 10.  There is a slow song with piano, chords, distant screams and drums, and a minute long clean intro on track 5.  Everything is very well planned and put together nicely.  2 of their older songs have even been remastered and put on here, track 4 + 8.  Tracks 7,8 and (sort of) 5 have clean vocals.  My only complaint is that the vocal track isn't loud enough, its tough to hear Trevor on some tracks.  Other than that, no flaws, absolutely awesome, well worth the $10 it is as fye.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Four words spring to mind whenever I hear this classic 1971 album from Carole King - home, warmth, love and sincerity. Even the half-lit album cover of a barefoot Carole with her cat sitting by a window somewhat evokes this. There's just something very reassuring and familiar about this album, perfect for listening to if you're feeling sentimental on a rainy day, or optimistic on a spring morning. \\"Tapestry\\" arrived at something of a strange time for music. The idealism and politically-inspired music of the 60's had come to an end, and as if to let everyone know the 60's had well and truly finished, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison and Janis Joplin had all passed on while the Beatles, the Supremes and Simon &amp; Garfunkel had all gone their separate ways. Music seemed unsure where to go until glam rock and progressive rock developed, along with disco later. It was during this \\"void\\" in 1970/71 that songwriters of the 50's and 60's seem to emerge as the hitmakers of the day with songs that often told stories; people such as Neil Sedaka, Joni Mitchell, Paul Simon, James Taylor and Carole King. \\"It's Too Late\\" was one of those songs I'd always hear on the radio and I bought \\"Tapestry\\" on the strength of liking that song alone. I recognized the titles \\"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow\\" and \\"You Make Me Feel Like A Natural Woman\\" from the versions made hits by The Shirelles and Aretha Franklin respectively, and when I listened to the album I discovered \\"I Feel The Earth Move\\" was the same song as that made a hit by Martika in the UK in 1989. There isn't one song on this album I don't like, but \\"So Far Away\\" is probably my favorite on the album. \\"You've Got A Friend\\" is another track that particularly stands out for me. I read an interview with Alanis Morissette in 1996 in which she said the middle 8 in that song just killed her every time she heard it, and I know what she means. You look forward to hearing it as much, if not more so, than the song itself. The simplicity of the recordings on this album by using just drums, piano and bass is very effective and what give the album it's weight in gold as much as Carole King's brilliant songwriting. In this case, less is definitely more. Terrific album.recordings on this album by using just drums, piano and bass is very effective and what give the album it's weight in gold as much as Carole King's brilliant songwriting.

B000006OBQ|5.0|By 1966, Frank Sinatra had already established himself as a worldclass superstar. He was also an amazing showman. So imagine how great it was that his magnificent stage show was captured on tape and released to the public in 1966. The record was &quot;Sinatra At The Sands&quot;, recorded at the famous Las Vegas showroom with the Count Basie orchestra.<br />On this cd, Sinatra swings through 16 of his classics, including lively versions of &quot;Come Fly With Me&quot;, &quot;Fly Me To The Moon&quot;, &quot;I've Got You Under My Skin&quot; (best veresion of the song, studio or live), &quot;Get Me To The Church On Time&quot;, &quot;Luck Be A Lady&quot;, &quot;Where Or When&quot; and &quot;My Kind Of Town&quot;. Some of the best moments, however, are the mellow balads he does, including exceptional versions of &quot;It Was A Very Good Year&quot; and the haunting &quot;September Of My Years&quot;. Also, there's some of his hilarious yet eyebrow - raising stage banter that would have raised controversy today.<br />Count Basie and his fabulous orchestra shine on their two solo spots, &quot;One O'Clock Jump&quot; and a delightful &quot;Makin' Woopee&quot;. They also provide scorching backup for a Sinatra's performance. Just listen to the intro to &quot;Come Fly With Me&quot; and how Basie gently attackss the piano keys on &quot;Fly Me To The Moon&quot;. This is what a live show should be. I reco,mmen this cd annd only wish live shows could be more like this today.
B000066NW0|5.0|This album, first of all, has a big emotional value for me. You know, I used to listen to these songs in good and bad (but memorable) moments of my life. But that isn't going to make you like this CD, is it? No, it isn't.<BR>Maybe the number of copies this album sold may tell you something, it wouldn't sell that much if it sucked... You know, I don't like Avril Lavigne herself. She's arrogant, sometimes she acts like a poser and things, but her songs in this album rock. It's one of the few albums where all songs are great. And it's not just the singles you've listened to at the radio or MTV, this album has much more to offer. The singles, in fact, are some of the worst songs in my opinion.<BR>I don't know how to review such thing I love, but I'm sure you'll love it too. All songs are very catchy, and have very nice lyrics. Give it a try and then review it here to help other people decide if they should buy it or not. And, yes, this album is much better than her new album &quot;Under My Skin&quot;.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Slipknot has had the ability from the outset to get my attention. Initially, I thought they were the dumbest thing going. The clown masks and nine members were enough tomake me roll my eyes so far to the back of my head that I would be staring at my brain melting. Prior to the release of &quot;Iowa&quot;, I read an interview with Slipknot in Guitar World. The cover said &quot;Slipknot=Metal&quot;. OK, I'll give it a read while I wait for my prescription. Inside, various members are referencing Iron Maiden, Kreator, Manowar and Slayer as influences. I admit to being more than impressed. Apparently, my friend read that same interview because when &quot;Iowa&quot; came out, he bought it. Beyond the initial surprise of the first song, &quot;Iowa&quot; was a monsterous disappointment. So, why am I reviewing &quot;Volume 3&quot;, let alone giving it 5 stars?<br />I constantly explore new music, even from bands I previously hated (at least in the rock/metal genres). I guess it's a combination of intrigue and self-inflicted torture. With that in mind, I proceeded to download &quot;Pulse Of The Maggots&quot;. Initially, I thought it was fairly good. From that sample, Slipknot had severely toned down the rapping and added some pretty impressive guitar leads. I loaded the song into my iPod for future listening. By the week leading up to &quot;Volume 3&quot; appearing in stores, I hailed &quot;Pulse&quot; as my favorite new song. In that same week, I heard &quot;Duality&quot; on the radio and though it was nowhere close to as abrasive as &quot;Pulse&quot;, it was a good song. I was sold. I decided to bite my lip, buy the new Slipknot and hope for the best.<br />The best is what I got. Simply put, &quot;Volume 3&quot; is every bit as good as I hoped it might be and then some. Unlike earlier recordings of Slipknot, this album realizes all of the potential that was displayed earlier. This album is as diverse as one can ask for: heavy, intricate, raging, melodic and overall powerful. This time around, Slipknot uses their prior &quot;rap&quot; influence as a severe afterthought and blends a healthy mix of their previous rage and aggression with technical drum flair, intricate fretboard work, acoustic meandering and soulful atmosphere. Slipknot has taken elements of the more experimental and progressive metal scene to the mainstream with roaring success. You are not going to find a better metal album getting this much attention anywhere ever.<br />Slipknot comes off better against the competition not through radio hits or clever marketing but simply because their music IS better. Granted, that's not to say that there aren't bands that are as good and even better than Slipknot going unnoticed (I'm sure the members would cite some that I'm thinking of) but in the wake of this outstanding effort, Slipknot proved to me that they can hang with the likes of Meshuggah, Soilwork and other metal bands that have floored me in the past few years. Being a picky old man, that's quite a feat for any band. My hat goes off to Slipknot...good show!l.

B0001UL7RY|4.0|I loved her first album so much... All songs were awesome and catchy. Nothing was more reasonable than buying her second album to see what's up. Some said she was changed, and I didn't like that thing, since her past album was near perfection. She's very changed... unfortunately.<BR>Somebody has to tell Avril she's a pop singer, not a rock singer. What she has done in this record was a mistake, she's pretending she's a rock singer but she's not. All those guitar solos, a little heavy songs... It has nothing to do with her and her voice, and few to do with the Avril we've listened in &quot;Let Go&quot;, you know what I'm saying? Avril, I hope you return to your &quot;roots&quot; in the next album. <BR>Best songs in here are indeed the singles &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; and &quot;My Happy Ending&quot;. This album may entertain you for some weeks, but not for years, like &quot;Let Go&quot; did... Still, if you liked her first album, you should support her, buying this one. I'd give it 3.5/5 stars, but I'll give it a 4/5.
B00020HEG6|5.0|Although the basic theme of Harry potter is still there, you can hear the major difference of the movie in this soundtrack. You can hear and feel the dark and chilling sounds of the movie and have to give credit to John Williams for giving the third installment a uniquly different sound.
6304711905|5.0|This is probably the best telling of the Wyatt Earp/Doc Holliday saga I have ever seen. I have watched many movies about the legendary fight at the O.K. Corral, but none have been as enthralling as the characters in &quot;Tombstone&quot;. Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer are more believable as Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday than any other actors portraying those characters. The much praised John Ford Classic &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot; while a great movie, was riddled with inaccuracies even to the point of making Doc Holliday a surgeon rather than a dentist. &quot;Tombstone&quot; tried to stay as true to the actual characters as possible and in my opinion more than succeeded. On the heels of the slow, dragging Kevin Costner epic &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot;, &quot;Tombstone&quot; is much faster paced and holds the viewers attention with drama, action and breathtaking scenery all the way to the tearjerking end. Well made movie that should hold it's own for a long time to come, I'm definately a fan.
B0000TLA9G|3.0|Everybody knows that GNR was one of the greatest bands of the late 80's early 90's (along with Iron Maiden and Motley Crue).  So why aren't some of their better songs represented here?  Where is the acustic version of &quot;You're Crazy&quot; (much more powerful than the electric version)?  Where is &quot;Night Train&quot;?  Why is that TERRIBLE cover of Dylan's masterpice on this hits album? On a side note, see the movie &quot;Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid&quot; (the movie Dylan wrote the song for)and fully understand the context of the song - unlike GNR.  On the flip side, their version of &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; FAR exceeds McCartney's (Kudos because he wrote it), and I'm glad it's on this album. &quot;Sympathy&quot; is just one of those songs nobody should cover (Like &quot;LA Women&quot; - hello Billy Idol!).  &quot;Civil War&quot; is still the best Guns song. If it were omitted, I would not even have bothered.  Album is decent buy if you don't want to think about it too much, but overall the originals are still the best.
B00000JLWW|5.0|This movie is absolutly breathtaking! Kate Winslet really shines...This movie has earned its place in history as an EPIC!
1400032717|5.0|It's great to have a well written story and learn from it too!  I loved learning some things about autism and how families cope with it.  I loved hearing the story from this young boys point of view.  The mystery of this was wonderful, a mytery in a mystery.  Chistopher was a delight to meet and follow through this story!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|To sum up Chariot all i can say is amazing! If you have had a chance to hear any of his music you know what im talking about! This album is just a collaboration of soulful, a bit of rock with a touch of pop. He has been compared to Billy Joel and for a more recent comparison Jason Mraz and John mayer but he definitly has his own style going on. I stumbled upon this CD and just bought it and fell in love, the music is very uplifting and inspiring- his music truly comes from his heart, I would recommend this cd any day-hope you all enjoy! and hope that you can some day experience him live, it is truly something you want to look into(the energy is pouring off the stage)
B00024BHTC|1.0|1 review says that the first track is heavy as hell.  Well Metallica of the 80's were heavier than this.  As for the songs.......Opera and rock only ever worked with Queen.  I had high expectations but from hearing this album can only say this band Sucks big time!
B0001ZX0OW|4.0|Eastwood is using a particular directing method here that will not appeal to everyone. The method he is using is masterful and unique, and you probably have to have some sort of film or theatre background to truly appreciate it. It's called naturalism, and there ain't no bells and whistles in naturalism, folks. That's because you don't need any bells and whistles to communicate a story of such natural narrative force as &quot;Mystic River&quot;.<br />Eastwood does the only thing a truly talented and knowledgable director could do with this forceful story -- he stands back and lets it happen. Those looking to be hit over the head with Spielbergian emoting and Schwarzeneggerian posturing will need to look elsewhere. In other words -- subtlety, not Hollywood explosions/special effects and bombastic acting, is the key in this film.<br />This style of directing worked well in &quot;Unforgiven&quot; and it works doubly-well in &quot;Mystic River&quot;.<br />The only complaint I have with this film (this is the reason I gave it 4, not 5, stars) is the silly &quot;wife who won't talk&quot; moments in the film. Now, we can't really fault Eastwood, because he got these bits straight out of Lehane's book, but really, the bits came off as artsy and should have been cut. Also, the actress' makeup was badly done and that should have been fixed by a makeup artist.<br />That very minor complaint aside, this is a marvelous film. Buy this movie, and step back and watch a naturalistic masterpiece unfold.
B00006I53S|5.0|I bought this lens to use on a Digital Rebel and a Canon Elan II.  What sold me on it was the image stabilization feature which allows photographers to take pictures in lower light without requiring a tripod for stabilization.  The image stabilization feature works extremely well.  I tested it on my first outing with this lens by taking it to 6th street in Austin just as the sun was going down.  I took several sets of pictures, some with IS on and some with it off.  I also took seven or eight comparison sets where I shot first without IS and then with it.  This system really works, and pictures shot with the Image Stabilizer were much sharper in lower light.<br />What has also impressed me about this lens is the image quality.  It is definitely a step above the Digital Rebel kit lens, and shows much finer detail than that lens.  It also shows better contrast.  There is a very slight amount of chromatic aberration, but it's only noticable on very close inspection, and is no worse than any other zoom lens I've used.  Overall, this is an excellent addition to any Canon user's outfit.
B000067G3C|5.0|SPEED has been one of the handful of movies made in the last ten years that I keep coming back to again and again when I need an action fix. I think it's partly because its premise is so impossibly simple: there's a bomb on a bus that will go boom if the bus goes below 50 miles per hour. That's it. I also think it's also because for all the noise and action, it really doesn't take itself too seriously. Everyone, even the usually sulking Jeff Daniels, appears to be having a good time. And, of course, it doesn't hurt to have the maniacal Dennis Hopper performing opposite Keanu Reeves who is properly underplaying his role as HERO. <br />SPEED, I admit, is a no-brainer. But if I wanted to watch something cerebral and intellectual, there are plenty of others to choose from. I mean, from which to choose.

0385334206|5.0|This book is by far one of the most artistic books Vonnegut has ever written. Both a very poignant critique of American society and a auto-biography. In fact, it's a book that not only lambasts American lifestyles it's also a critique of Humanity as a whole. It's a satire about human folly and futility. It's About flesh machinery and complacency. It's About superfluous endeavors and non-sense. I never though I would laugh at misery and calamity before in my life , yet as one reads this primer laughing at such things is all but inevitable. <BR>On the literary aspect of this book, it possesses the master penmanship one would expect from Vonnegut. It's post-modern meta-fiction at its best. I HIGHLY recommend this title to anyone who's willing to reflect upon his life and who's willing to reflect upon societal values and moral values and human value. Definitely one of Vonnegut's best.

0375751513|3.0|Who knows?  But right-wing orthodox Catholic monarchist readers will be required to steel themselves through the first two chapters which consist of a drawn-out slap fight between Elton John, Graham Norton and Ian McKellan.  Now I like a cat-fight as much as the next guy, but a tussle among effete Brit cats with man parts is just icky.  So the narcissistic homo-erotic banter opening the book was significantly under-appreciated by this reader.  But after you get through those chapters the book gets much, much better.<br />It is difficult to maintain that the book represents a defense of amoral Aestheticism, since the embodiment of the aesthetic ideal, Dorian Gray, is shown to be a damned man.  That is not to say that Wilde embraces Catholicism in the novel, as the narrator often posits confusing opinions on issues of conscience and sin.  At times Wilde seems to suggest that only immoderate (quantitatively speaking) behavior is immoral; and yet, at other times, it appears some actions themselves ought to be avoided.  Is Wilde acknowledging that there are exceptionless moral norms?  And what is the reader to make of rotten Wotton, whose epigrammatic phrases seem so akin to Wilde's?  Hallward points out that Wotton's cynicism is a pose.  He never says a moral thing, but he never does a wrong thing.  So are we to take his Wilde-isms seriously?  Are we to take Wilde seriously?  Wilde says art is neither moral nor immoral, yet Gray is poisoned by A Rebors, a book by another decadent author who, oddly enough, also converted to Catholicism.  And then there's the picture itself, the fruit of Hallward's homosexual obsession, which is clearly cursed, in spite of its initial apparent beauty.<br />Wilde's protests notwithstanding, it is a book with a moral informing the reader that he cannot escape his conscience, that he cannot reject nature and nature's God, and that the wages of sin are death.  But therein lies hope, for if God is to be believed regarding the wages of sin, then why should we doubt Him regarding our Redemption?  Unfortunately, this message is made ambiguous by an author who, rather than unintentionally creating a distorted image of an idea that cannot be fully represented, intentionally peppers the novel with paradox for the sake of cuteness.  But the Truth is not cute.  He's terrifying, and Wilde knows better.  Therefore the book is best left to the orthodox or the decadent.  The lukewarm will simply be confused.then why should we doubt Him regarding our Redemption?

B00028HBKM|5.0|A lot of anti-religious hype and media biases could not damper the brilliance of this truly phenomenal cinematic masterpiece. The violence was not as graphic as advertised by the press, however, the violence did have an impact on me. Seeing what the Lord went through for ALL of us, touched me beyond any words that I could possibly type. Even though the film is subtitled in English, I found myself understanding it completely without reading the subtitles. Thank you to Mel Gibson for having the courage to bring this powerful depiction of our Lord to film. I hope and pray that this film touches all of you reading this as much as it has touched me and the millions of people around the world.
B00018D44U|1.0|i heard her and eminem had an affair because he went to her house for coffee<br />but back to the album, her first one was better, she experimented too much on this one, but o well
B00018D44U|2.0|I love this genre of music but I agree with some other reviewers...from my experience Norah Jones is ok but WAAY overrated...especially when compared to some of the true female greats that have musical and vocal range.  Norah Jones' music is just soft, corporate MUZAK.  People are being fooled into thinking that her music is somehow out of the mainstream but nothing could be further from the truth...it's very corporate.  After listening to her first album I predicted that she would begin to fade away in time due to her &quot;one-note&quot; approach and the prediction is coming true.<br />After listening to her first album I stated that she sounded like &quot;an annoying, one-note cat softly yowling on a back fence at night&quot; and my review stands.  By all mean listen to her first album but GRADUATE to better artists out there like some of Diana Krall's old work (not the new album - too much Elvis Costello influence), or Dusty Springfield, or the late great Eva Cassidy (grab her live album and just marvel at her voice - what a loss).<br />I guess I see Norah Jones as a nice intro into this sort of music for people - sort of like a good jug wine that prepares the palate for an even better wine to come.  Folks, do yourself a favor and stick with her first album, leave the second album on the shelf, and look around for the great music that's out there that's 5 or 6 steps up in quality - it's just not as commercialized so you'll have to take some time to look for it...but, after listening to this album, please trust me when I say that it's well worth it.  American public - it's time to graduate to better music!

0156027321|5.0|I read Life of Pi last summer.  It was the last book I read before chemotherapy rendered me too weak to read again for months. I naively found the book on a clearance table at my local Border Books store.  It is now VERY high on my list of favorite books and I've made both my children read it.  It is truly a story of faith and the strength of the human spirit.  The fact that it's a true story makes it all the more compelling.<br />THIS IS A MUST-READ!
B000294SFW|4.0|1.) I gave it 4 stars because Motorhead will still be the best metal band of all time, even if they never record another good album.    2.) I agree with the reviewer who said \\"best album since overnight sensation\\". Very true. I didn't like \\"Sacrifice\\", \\"Snake Bite Love\\" or \\"Hammered\\".     3.) This is a solid album. Must have for any Motorhead fan, but if you're new to Lemmy & Co, start with something else, for full effect.    4.) The \\"blues\\" are awesome. If you guys like that song, pick up Lemmy, Danny B. & Slim Jim album, in case you haven't already. It's that kind of stuff.    5.)Read Lemmy's book - \\"White Line Fever\\"    UPDATE - I've been listening to it for a few months and I am sorry - I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT *5* STARS... I'm now convinced that this is the best album they ever made.. Better then \\"Ace Of Spades\\" and \\"1916\\". \\"Keys to the Kingdom\\" is one of the best metal songs ever recorded.
6301763041|5.0|Cry Baby is one of my top 5 favorite movies. I've been watching it sinse I was 6 years old, dancing around the living room singing along to those catchy (but corny) songs! I'm 17 years old, i've been watching the USA channel version long enough! Put this great movie on DVD so I can buy it! Just to give the movie some props instead of just begging for it to be on DVD, here's my opinion: the actors are hillarious and talented, the plot is unbelievably corny (in a good way), and it's one of the greatest movies you'll ever see!
B000094FGO|3.0|I'll admit: Evanescence is pretty good. Amy Lee has a powerful voice. But Evanescence just doesn't quite do it for me.<br />First of all, their guitars are really weak. You can barely hear them! Maybe it's just me, but the way-too-simple chords and rhythms are boring, for lack of a better word. Plus, what is with that random guitar solo in &quot;Going Under&quot;? That just bugs me.<br />Second, Amy's voice stands out too much. Sure, she's got a good voice, but it's overpowering everything else until it's just her and nothing else. You can barely hear the guitars, bass and drums. All parts don't blend as well as they should, in my opinion. <br />All in all, Evanescence isn't the worst band ever, they just need a little work. Maybe if they worked on their balance a little more, they could be at the top of my list. But for now, they're in the middle.
B000002UVX|5.0|This is the absolute BEST album by legendary guitarist Jimi Hendrix. It is widely agreed that he was the absolute best player that ever lived and this album was testament to his genius. The early three Jimi Hendrix albums have good song writing but they are within the pop/psychedelic rock genre. The mediocre white muscians his manager Chas Chandler paired him with in England are so beneath Hendrix. Mitchell is limp wristed and lacks the Jonh Bonham style bomb blast drumming and gospel scream of Buddy Miles. The Noel Redding bass is impossible to hear in the mix on any previous Hendrix record. What most people don't realize is that Hendrix earned his reputation playing with nearly every Black soul and rythym and blues legend as a session muscian during the late 50s and early 60s. The &quot;Band of Gypsys&quot; is simultaneously a show of his deep southern blues/soul roots but also transcends the limited definitions blues/rock and creates soundscapes ranging from gospel soul,acid jazz, hard funk, and heavy metal. The latter three musical categories were not actually genres of music at the date of recording in 1969. This is blatant proof of Hendrix's visionary influence over the music world. Many people have complained that this is a LIVE album. The old Delta Blues and Soul albums of the deep south were cut with live bands singing while recording. The deep intense bass of Billy Cox creates a hard funk groove that never misses a beat. The drums of Buddy Miles are like bombs going off in Vietnam. Hendrix's guitar playing is simply phenomenal. He avoids his demeaning carnival tricks like burning the guitar or his insipid pop cover songs like &quot;Wild Thing&quot;. The man is a VIRTUOSO! He plays rock and roll guitar like a classical genius. Indeed I believe he is a classical genius born in a black blues guitarist body during the 60s!. This album also features his most life affirmative lyrics making this album seem like Requiem. The anti-war &quot;Machine Gun&quot; is easily his best song ever. His playing imitates machine guns, bombs, and planes. It is pure genius. The diversity of the other tracks showcases how far Hendrix's imagination and talent would have taken us if he were here a little while longer. Please buy this album. The only Hendrix record you will ever need.
B00005JMUA|5.0|If you thought \\"Vol. 1\\" was good, \\"Vol. 2\\" is better! The on-screen death toll is much lower, allowing Tarantino (and us) to focus on the Bride's individual battles with the remaining Deadly Vipers and (of course) Bill himself. This is Tarantino at his best; don't miss it!
B00003CX95|5.0|this is one of the best, if not the best movie i have ever seen, but the dvd isn't packed with extras. i hope next year there will be a 10th anniversery release with more extras.
1592400876|3.0|This is a charming book that will appeal to anyone who's -- not whose, thank you very much -- distraught over the decline of English grammar in the Modern Age, whatever coast or continent one inhabits.  At minimum, it recognizes that there are others out there like us who still care about the details of composition.  I especially appreciated the short section on the sometimes poor quality of some Amazon.com book reviews.<br />That said, I absolutely hate the British word for period -- &quot;full stop.&quot;  This is prose, not a naval excursion on the high seas. I also detest the propensity to have full stops and commas dangling beyond the friendly confines of quotation marks.  It all seems so very untidy.<br />Further, one of the hallmarks of the English language -- British and American -- is its ability to assimilate other words into its semantic penumbra.  The plight of greengrocers trying to find a suitable plural for banana is much ado about very little; in Spanish, it is bananas, and bananas it ought to be.  The proposition that a tidle and &quot;s&quot; should follow banana instead of &quot;bananas&quot; is utter rubbish.<br />A pleasant summer read, but much too short.  All hail Manutius!  Long live the semicolon!
B000068TPN|4.0|the war scenes are outstanding, but the scenes with the women getting the cards were too sappy. dvd has good extras. the irish song was kind of strange at first, but it and the rest of the music was very good.
B000092ZYX|2.0|There's been a steady decline in the quality of this band's music since OK Computer and they've reached the nadir with Hail to the Thief.  The quality of songwriting on this album is so poor in comparison to their earlier material, part of me hopes they'll break up before they create even more damage to their reputation.  Perhaps it was too much to ask for a band to maintain the level that was established on The Bends and the previously mentioned computer, which are two of the best albums of all time.  The one thing radiohead were really good at, were writing songs that gripped at your heart; melodies and rhythms so astonishing, so breathtaking, you didn't want the album to end.  You were left gasping for more.  It was there on Kid A and Amnesiac too, although to a lesser extent.  Sad to say, there's none of that on this album.  Most of the songs are average at best, and easily forgotten once you've listened to it.  The best side (I have the vinyl, more on that below) is side four, which begins with drunken punch up at a wedding and ends with the best song on the album; wolf at the door.  But even these will never be in my list of the best radiohead songs.  There are none of the brilliant melodies from the prior albums.  It's an average record.  Can they turn the ship around before they sail over the abyss?  I really hope they can.<br />But right now, they remind me of a star baseball player who's best efforts are in the past and now, is just hanging around a little too long.<br />One final editorial, if you're a fan, I would recommend getting the vinyl of Ok Computer and the Bends at least (I have all of them).  The vinyl pressings are so much more enjoyable to listen to than cd.  The sound is fuller, and richer than the brittle sound of the cd's.  Vinyl really does justice to radiohead's music.  Cheers.
B00008EY9G|4.0|a good suspense/horror movie with a big twist at the end that didn't work for me, though it should be commended for it's originality. the extras are pretty good.
B000267JQK|5.0|First off, let's clear the fact that this is NOT a &quot;new&quot; album from Seether, i noticed one reviewer went into this album thinking it was...this is a re-release of their Wind-Up Records debut, 'Disclaimer&quot;...the band has remastered their debut bringing the guitars further out into the mix, making them sound more raw and energetic, a much better sound by the way...also the added some new textures and subtle nuances compared to the originals...however the real bulk of this album is 8 extra tracks you get, these mainly consisting of outtakes from the 'Disclaimer' sessions as well as those culled from soundtracks and the like...the standout tracks from extras for me include 'Out of my Way', Got it Made', and the amazing reworking of 'Broken' with Amy Lee of Evanescence...as an added bonus you also get a dvd with the band's 4 videos as well as a live performance and behind-the-scenes footage of the 'Broken' video...all in all, this is an amazing re-release from an amazing band, definitely check them out...also recommended is the recently re-released Shinedown debut, 'Leave A Whisper'
B00005JMJ4|1.0|i don't really have the right to review this because i couldn't stand to watch more than half of this movie. it is one of the most boring movies i've ever seen. none of my family liked it or even watched the whole thing.
B0002BO0AS|5.0|...this 5 star review is totally earned. The Metal/Hardcore/Metalcore category has always been somewhat of saturated genre, but now it's beginning to fuse and take form. The front runners are Bleeding Through, As I Lay Dying and obviously Unearth. I'll admit I downloaded the album... but I'm blown away enough to actually go out and buy it. The first song I heard from it was &quot;This Lying World&quot;, it's not even my favorite track but I was still impressed. I decided to download the whole thing because I kept hearing the name Unearth more and more. And now that I have the full thing, it hasnt left my CD player since. The drum and guitar work is excellent... and I have no problem saying it dwarfs most bands around today. The moment you hear any of the songs from The Oncoming Storm you'll easily be able to see that Unearth is a very guitar driven band. Even the vocals arent like your generic metalcore singer's screaming and yelling. It actually grows on you. Absolutely no filler tracks, get this album.<br />Stand out tracks: Failure, This Lying World, Zombie Autopilot, Bloodlust of the Human Condition and Black Hearts Now Reign
B00005JKN9|5.0|this movie had great action and set. the story was good and so are the extras on the dvd. disapointments are that there will be no directors cut, no deleted scenes on this dvd, and leonardo dicaprio. even if they had to get a big star for the lead role, there are so many more fitting actors for this role than the pretty-boy dicaprio.
B00005JKCH|5.0|This is one of hte best movies ever! JK Simmons was the best playing Jameson. He totally blew my mind in Spiderman 2 but its only because he is nothing more than a Howard Hesseman wannabe! Hey JK, is your career that bad that you have to try so hard to look like that guy from WKRP Cincinatti and Head of the Class? Were you rejected as a teacher? Were you a failed radio DJ? You deserve an Oscar for both movies... you gave me great laughs!<br />I also think Kristen Dunst looks like she has apple cheeks! Toby Mcguire is a great pic of spiderman but he's no JK Simmons :cough: Howard Hesseman!
B000006TRV|5.0|the wall along with the dark side of the moon was one of the greatest cd's ever recorded by any group due to songs like comfortably numb.this great cd should be there in yiur collection.highly recommended.
B00006SFBD|5.0|As one who prefers the heavier side of progressive metal, I thouroughly enjoyed this opeth album. It may not be there best work, but it certainly tops any other album by any other band. <br />Strong songs include: Wreath &amp; A Fair Judgement<BR>Weaker songs: None<br />Wreath is a great way to jump right into the album with deep growls that blend well with the tone of the music. The guitar as usual is phenominal. This song does an excellent job of making the vocals loud enough to enjoy over the instruments, but not to loud that you can't catch the drum beats in the background and the guitar. I particularly like the phase around 1:47 from heavy guitar and growling to a slightly lighter tone that ends with a drum beat and an incredibly smooth transition that has no time lost.<br />The transition to Deliverance is so clean that I never picked it up the first few times listening to this album. I like the change up within the first quarter of this song from heavy to light. The end of the song does a great job of co-ordinating the drums and guitars on a beat. That's talent.<br />A Fair Judgement, one of the lighter, but not Benighted or Harvest tone does a good job of showing off Akerfeldt's lighter vocals with no growling at all. This song is loved by many of my friends who would not normally listen to Opeth because of the savage deep growls. This song has some amazing acoustic vocal and guitar combinations.<br />The calmest song on the album, For Absent Friends, is a bit repetitive if heard on it's own, but it does a great job of breaking up the album's heaviness. It is short, but holds some great acoustic guitar portions.<br />Master's Apprentice is great work. The begining lyrics, although don't have much meaning are great for the heavy attitude of the song. The only complaint about this song is that it gets repetitive enough that I always space out somewhere between the 6-8th minute and i'm not sure what the latter middle half of the song contains.<br />The beginingof By the Pain I see in Others is so great. I like the fade from drowned out guitar to full fledged guitar, drums, and base is well timed and pumps the song up for the finale. I like the attempt at a completely original ending with erie vocals at the end of the song, but I still don't get the ending.<br />This album is a must have for an Opeth lover's collection. It definitely is a heavier album, and I've been told that it corresponds with Damnation which I unfortunaltely have not bought yet (stuid me). The collaboration of the instruments is in perfect harmony and this really elaborates on the bands incredible musical talent. I like the erie water noises throughout the album.
B000006TRV|5.0|please ignore the one star reviews of a certain one star reviewer on this page who seems to have too much time on her hands to slam this great band everyday in her meaningless and thouroughly biased reviews written under a number of names.this is one of the best records ever made.buy it!!!!!.

It amazed me that there were so many movie reviewers giving this film a C yet these were the same people singing the praises of Titanic and the Matrix movies. The life of Jesus Christ should not be watered down or fabricated which this film definitely does not do. It's the raw deal which is often too much to handle is this think-what-you-want-if-you-feel-like-it society. The fact that the movie was done in the languages of the Middle East only addded to its authenticity among so many details which were also done supurbly.
B00008CLOA|5.0|please ignore a certain one star reviewer on this page who hates this band and seems to have too much time on her hands to slam this great band under different names.please disregard her meaningless,pointless and biased reviews and buy this classic album which sounds great even 30 years after it was recorded.
0671027387|4.0|The words &quot;Dan Brown&quot; at the top of the cover enticed me to buy this book in the airport...  Having loved Angels &amp; Demons I thought I'd give this a try.  I really liked this book, I thought it was a fun read.  The characters weren't as enticing as I would have liked, but when all was said and done, I had a smile on my face.
B000002A3T|5.0|the division bell was the last and one of the finest albums made by floyd and shows gilmour at his best and contains the grammy winning instrumental marooned.this awesome cd should be there in your collection.very highly recommended.
0385512104|2.0|I thought the angle the author took (writing from the point of view of a young autistic child) was about the only interesting thing I can say for the book.  It was very slow and the author threw in so many haphazard facts that were both confusing and somewhat pointless, that by the time I finished the book, I wondered what was the point?  I don't know, I expected it to be much better and it was just okay.
B0000048CX|5.0|Fakebook could quite possibly be one of the best albums of the year.   YLT itslef could possibly one of the best bands of the decade!   I am totally and completely in love with this c.d. and i highly reccommend it!   The song &quot;Speeding Motorcycle&quot; is just the cutest, quirkiest thing ever! I gaurentee you will love this c.d.!
7119024086|4.0|And have the money and space, get this one; has the original chinese characters on one page, the facing page has the translation.  Moss's annotations are insightful and interesting- the only complaint is the lackluster grammar and spelling...  But, looking beyond that, this is a great addition to any literary collection, public or private.  (And if you need to see what the book is about, you probably wouldn't be reading this)
B0000C8AW7|5.0|Just bought this album.  Not in a rush to check out present day Dylan, but I was buying a few of his SACD re-masters and this was with them so I thought I'd give it a go.<br />In a word - wow!  This is the most vital sounding Dylan album I have heard for many a year.  Definitely one of the best of his career.  And that voice - I don't know if he's been gargling razor blades or what, but it certainly works.<br />I suggest the reviewer who dismissed this as Dylan trying to sound like he did in the '60s, gets his ears syringed.  This is as &quot;roots&quot; as they come but is no mere nostalgia trip or revisiting of past glories.<br />A mini-tour of Southern American music with all that is  idiosyncratic Dylan, with a red hot band thrown in for good measure.  More please Mr. Zimmerman!<br />I'm born again!  I believe!
0446310786|5.0|As an Education major at West Virginia State University, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about themselves and others.  Although Lee's novel has appeared on many &quot;banned and challenged&quot; book lists, I find it should be an integral part of every child's education.  By exposing our children to racism and how to handle situations involved with racism, we are helping our children tremendously.  This is an excellent book!
B0001AVZA8|2.0|That's it.  No more.  After this, I refuse to watch another movie based on the absolutely ludicrous proposition that Jack Nicholson is sexy or even charming.  In this one, he is, at best, a leering repulsive old roue and no amount of cute dialogue can obscure it.<br />At one point, the actress playing Keaton's twenty-something daughter gushes about how attracted she was by Nicholson's personality.  That scene underlines the utter dishonesty of this movie because it is obvious to any discerning female that all he has to offer is money and clout.  I wondered how the mother in this movie would have reacted to the notion that her daughter was doing a little quid pro quo with a powerful old guy in order to upgrade her wardrobe or whatever.  It might have made things more interesting and believable.  But, unfortunately, we are supposed to like the characters in this movie.    <br />Without Nicholson it might have worked.  As it was, the intimate scenes between him and both actresses playing mother and daughter were redolent with all sorts of unpleasant and yucky speculations.  <br />I've read that some women used to find Nicholson attractive.  I believe it.  I don't understand it, but I believe it.  I just don't believe that any self respecting woman of any age would still do so.  (As for any woman choosing him over Keneau Reeves, I think others here have already expressed the appropriate amount of incredulity.)<br />Hollywood honchos must identify with the Nicholson brand of crass powerful-old-guy horniness.  (He is their fantasy of themselves still suavely pulling the chicks despite the fact that he and they retain not a shred of personal attractiveness.)  That must be why he still gets these leading man parts.  Well, it must stop.  <br />There are mature actors out there who can play believable leading men if the script calls for autumnal romance; that elegant collection of still beautiful bones, Paul Newman, for one, Warren Beatty for another (just imagine Beatty andKeaton together).  And then there is James Garner, no longer beautiful but still sexy as hell with his laid back charm.   <br />So, Hollywood, hear my plea, no more shots of Jack Nicholson's aging dimpled butt.  Please.  I would like to think that there is a limit to how low western civilization can sink.<br />One more thing, why do protagonists in movies like this have to be world famous?  When did that start?  Keaton's a world famous playwright.   Nicholson's a world famous producer.  Jeeze Marie!  <br />Tell you what, skip this movie and watch one with the same theme where the protagonists are a skirt-chasing middle-aged dentist and his dowdy receptionist.  I am speaking of the wonderful \\"Cactus Flower\\" with Walter Matthau, Ingrid Bergman, and...sigh...Goldie Hawn in her first magical incarnation.  <br />Take my advice.  It will make you so happy.
B000002H33|3.0|Little talent then, less talent now. The story of metalica.<br />To be fair, they did have a nice thing going for awhile, over a decade of little competition is pretty impressive. But then like most things, another band comes along and makes them irrelevent. <br />If not for more impressive bands like Otep, I would say that Metalica is still one of the best, but after listening to these improved bands, matalica is like a lost child cring for its mommy that abandoned him ages ago. <br />I gave them an extra star for being the first. But that has more to do with chance than talent.
B0000AR8NK|3.0|Not really one of my favorite of Bowie's music. It is still very good though. I'm just more into her earlier works.<BR> I admit though that I do listen to his older albums more.
B000084T18|2.0|Rap is a style of music that came up very quickly, and why? Because its rediculously easy to make and people are stupid enough to buy it. I have a computer that can play a beat, and I can talk in rhymes for about three or four minuets, if I wasn't white then I could be a big rap star to. <br />Yes this guy is angry which shows he has at least some emotion, but its still something that everyone without stage fright can do.<br />I gave him an extra star because the computer he uses did make at least some good beats. If it werent for his &quot;singing&quot; they would almost be decent space fillers.
B00000K3D4|5.0|This is a great movie! I love it so much. It's kind of corny by today's standards. However, it is allot of fun.<BR>The costumes are really cool to look at. David Bowie's music is fun in it as well.<BR>Makes a nifty sound track. The character Sarah Williams is kind of annoying. However, David is great in it.
B00008AWOG|5.0|First off, before i start an impartial review, I LOVE OPETH. they are my favorite band of all time at this moment, and have been now for roughly 3 years. that being said....<br />With 2000 roughly approaching, everyone had in mind a good canidate for album of the millenium. Many would say its the Black Album, or the White Album, or even the Brown Album (Primus fans love it, do you?) but one album shines through all the gems and gives these classic albums a run for their money. <br />Am i calling Still Life album of the millenium? Nah. i dont have such a bold claim, i am a lover of too many bands and too much music to display such favoritism toward any one release that is to sum up a time that perhaps like Still Life, has seen rises and falls, just like the rough deathy raw Opeth so darkly contrasts the jazz and acoustic laden Damnation style Opeth. <br />You see both on Still Life, in seperate measures too. You can see how Opeth became legendary thanks to albums like Morningrise and My Arms Your Hearse because of the sheer brutality that songs like &quot;The Moor&quot; and &quot;Moonlapse Vertigo&quot; possess. But secondly you bear witness to an evolution of sorts, where Opeth finally decided that they would mold their craft with more experimental material. You can see it in the latter track, the jazz/rock riff at the 5 minute mark is not a new aspect of Opeth's winning formula, just one that they finagle around with a bit more. <br />Another aspect of this disc that cannot be overlooked is the sheer beauty in anguish that the two acoustic laden tracks, &quot;Benightened&quot; and &quot;Face of Melinda&quot; offer. Gone are the gory power riffs and boombastic drumming that define the death edge of Opeth, and featured is the dramatic, tearful requiems that Opeth fans will spawn familier thoughts of &quot;To Bid You Farewell&quot; to for days on end. Mikael's soft voice rings forth so genuine in these two sparkling gems. <br />The album's dawning concept is somethingthat is to be debated upon. Melinda is a long lost lover seemingly of leader Mikael, who's vocal performance throughout this epic disc seems hauntingly like he were performing it in front of Melinda, or even more chilling, at her funeral. Did he kill her? Did he get cast out of town? This whodunit formula shouldn't be offered while understanding the lush atmosphere of this album. Like the title, Still Life, this album represents one moment in time, one ticking second from a day in the life of someone, perhaps the crying, tortured soul that adorns the cover of the disc. all these things that are debated as a concept could be done in an instant, or might have been done in the same period. <br />Any fan of Opeth needs to own this essential release. Its a fitting bridge between My Arms Your Hearse and Blackwater Park. Finally, while this may not be the album of the millenium, its most definately in my mind, album of that year.
0440238609|5.0|Being crowned number three in BBC's Top Read, I had to check this book out. <BR>After reading it, I felt this book definitely deserved it position, if not, higher. <BR>Firstly, the language is much simplier than that of LotR or Harry Potter, in fact, this books language is equal of an 11 year olds, although not meaning it is just for them. <BR>The book has a captivating plot, an epic adventure which brings Lyra and Will across the Jordan castles, pass the deserts, through the blizzard North, into the lands of two other parallet universes. <BR>Some feel that they get put off by novels of epic poportions beacuse of the large number of characters, this is not the cast in \\"His Dark Materials\\". In the triology, everyone you meet is stuck into your mind due to their seperate characteristics, just reading the name gives an immediate immpression of the character, and Phillip Pullman cleverly weaves in tiny detail which leaves the reader want more.<BR>With the above said, this triology is a must read, a classic; an epic. The themes inside are clear and direct, and provokes the reader to think as well as be captivated by the complex plot which boils down to one simple story; the fall of mankind. <BR>The title of the triology, \\"His Dark Materials\\" is a reference to John Miltons \\"Paradise Lost\\", if you liked this epic poem, this book is for you. Nevertheless, I heartly reccommend this triology, for its splendid writing, breath taking adventure, the simplicity of it all, yet it a classic that one will not forget, this remains the best book I have yet to read!
B000002UA0|1.0|I am a pink floyd fan but I do not like this album or any of pink floyd's early (experimental is I think the word used to describe their early music) albums including PATGOD, ASOS, AHM, UG.  I only like pink floyd albums from Meddle onwards cause this was the stage when pink floyd must have sobered up or dtoxed or grew up because their early experimental albums sound like they were recorded when the band were drunk or stoned.<br />I watched the DVD pink floyd: the syd barrett story and they were portraying syd as a genius or a pioneer.  I only thought why?  Anybody could play the guitar rubbing objects along the stings and fret to produce wierd irritating noises and play out of beat and out of tune.<br />Don't get me wrong, it is sad that syd suffered the problems he had or still has but I don't really sympahize with people who willingly take experimental drugs.  <br />If you really want to listen to good pink floyd then have a listen to albums like dark side of the moon, the wall, wish you were here, animals just to name a few.
B00020BVXI|4.0|This is a great entry to the Spiderman series. It has very memorable moments like when Spiderman killed the green goblin(his best friend harrys father.), who was turned into a monster. If you like this go see the second one. Its better.
B000002UA5|1.0|This is an album in which its own creators admitted that they b***s***ed their way through recording.  It is pretty obvious that they were running very low on ideas.  <br />It is like trying to write a 2000 word essay and you place in any old rubbish and filler just to provide the 2000 words.
B00001OH7V|5.0|Even being a classic-rock lover, I remained un-introduced to David Bowie for a long time. I consider it a shame. I had two albums by him (Hunky Dory &amp; Station to Station) for almost 1 year, I listened them once or twice but it did not interest me much. A few days back when I tried Station to Station, it sounded great to me. I re-listened it, I thought it is awesome, and then I re-listened Hunky Dory... Still good.<br />Ziggy Stardust, Aladdin Sane, Low, Heroes was in my wish list for long time because of their high placing in all-time best album charts. So when I saw a double album having &quot;Heroes&quot; &amp; &quot;Scary Monsters&quot;, I promptly grabbed them. Both are very good and I am searching for Ziggy Stardust, Aladdin Sane &amp; Low now.<br />Below is what I think of &quot;Heroes&quot;...the album<br />Beauty &amp; the Beast - Album jump-start with this savage rocker. Very raw sounding and appropriately supported by Robert Fripp's twisted guitar sounds. But the song does not give a picture of what to expect from the album.<br />Joe the Lion - Much more soothing than album started, and again accompanied by Fripp's amazing trademark sound. Very distinguishable sound he creates with his axe.<br />&quot;Heroes&quot; - That song about two lovers separated by a wall... I heard a cover of this song by Jacob Dylan's band The Wallflowers, I did not even know that Bowie was the original creator. Haunting vocals, Haunting song...<br />Sons of the Silent Age, Black Out &amp; V2 Schneider - Three of rowdy Crimsonish experimental tracks. Robert Fripp does his bit to make them sound like that. <br />Sense of doubt, Moss Garden &amp; Neuköln - A trilogy of cool experimental instrumentals. Moss Garden is the best of the lot and almost sounded like Indian classical music. All three tracks are continuous with no gaps between them. Sometimes they sound like early Pink Floyd tunes.<br />Secret Life of Arabia - Very much different from the previous 9 tracks. This bumpy dance track ends the album light heartedly after very serious (&amp; great) instrumental.<br />Overall a great experimental album. People who like experimental/art/progressive rock, should like it. So no wonder I liked it, but it is more like a mixture of King Crimson, Pink Floyd &amp; Roxy Music with great contributions from Robert Fripp, Brian Eno, Carlos Alomar &amp; Bowie himself. Please do not expect a Genesis (one of my all time favourite band) here, but it is still very progressive. Many people compare it with Low. I also like to do that but after listening Low.<br />Final Verdict: Buy it if you like experimental music.

B000088E6D|5.0|So you like Frank and Bobby better?  Quite a left-handed insult. Although it's fair to say that Buble' comes from that style, (and who could be interested in this kind of music without listening to a -lot- of Sinatra?), it's also apparent to me that this guy just opens his mouth and -sings-, naturally and musically. Some people aren't built to punk out, guys. Let's allow two or three saloon singers to have a career .
B000000OQF|5.0|Oh, it was something all right. This loud, chugging, brutal nasty song on the radio about a jungle that made us want to jump up and down. My siblings and I were mesmerized in our little adolescent world and fascinated by the music. The television jumped with a video of this gross yet oddly beautiful frontman on his knees while the audience tries to drag him into the maelstrom he created. The lanky bass player gives us this knowing wink on the downbeat while a top hated guitar player and some bored looking gypsy coax monstrous sounds out of their guitars. And it made our little suburban life look so dull. <br />Our joy and elation knew no bounds the day our dad came home from work with a slight detour at Turtle's Records and Tapes (ask your grandparents, kids) to buy something called a CD of that band's album. Rejoice, we thought, for musical enlightenment was moments away. We went berserk inside while my audiophile father put on the disc and turned the volume knob up unreasonably high. The thundering, echoing riff tore through our house and we danced with glee. The song finished, we giggled and grinned as the next song started and my whole outlook changed. It sounded like a train having a bullfight with a tornado. Sister in a Sunday dress? Why is the singer's voice so low and murky? Is that sleaze? Why isn't he high-pitched? Standing up? Think I'm so cool? Well of course...Oh my God....what did he just say?<br />And then I saw the look on my father's face change, and knew it surely matched the look on my mother's face while she was loading the dishwasher, trying to ignore the din from the den. My father's hand nearly tore the knob off the volume as he cut off the music and shuttered us out of the den; we knew our little party was over. I'm sure my mother's stare sent daggers at my father while we were ushered over to the kitchen area. Why? Who knows, perhaps they wanted to observe if we were about to mutate into something hideous and barbaric like the music that hadplayed just moments ago. I can't debate the merits of my father letting us listen that night. I just knew that from then on, things were different. We snuck into the den before my parents came home from work and listened to the album again and again. We copied it onto tapes to carry with us and listen to in our rooms when our parents thought we were sleeping. Music became this new, huge, menacing beast. It could be a release, a celebration, a call to arms, or whatever I wanted it to be. I knew of this place called LA, I just didn't know it could be so gritty, so unappealing, and yet so alive. <br />Nearly twenty years on, I can look back and say that this record changed me the way it changed everyone else here. Suddenly, a life that I never knew about was achingly clear in these songs. And yet, it didn't turn me into a hooligan, drug dealer, Satanist, misogynist, troubled youth, or any other assorted thing that parents seemed to fear about this band. Maybe I had good parents who taught me a difference between what you hear and what you do in life. Sure, maybe if I had been older and in LA I could've fallen into a vortex like that, but from my own perch, this album lived it's own life for me, and I wore out the CD player and taped copy in my walkman listening to these booze soaked tales of struggle and survival, heartbreak, rage, and misunderstanding. Nearly every song is a gem and deserves a good listening before written off as a \\"weak\\" track. <br />And like every defining group, you'd go back and source their influences. I knew about the Beatles, but not really the Rolling Stones. Aerosmith? Weren't they in that video with Run DMC? What's a New York Doll? Things like this weren't clear to a 12 year old, and learning how Izzy crafted his sound in search of a Keith Richards vibe, or Slash's blues burn based on a Boston band, made music that much better, and helped define this album on it's own merits. <br />At the risk of heresy, I'd say this album was as importantas \\"Nevermind the Bollocks...Here's the Sex Pistols\\" and defined an era just as well. America was confused, bored, occupied, and in a deep malaise and the result was this record.  <br />I stopped borrowing the old, worn out CD a while ago, dismissing it as unsophisticated dinosaur rock in an age of grungy plaid flannel, trip-hop and BritPop. And yet when I think about how many bands formed and made music just as important and life-changing because of the influence of Appetite for Destruction, it makes me miss it that much more. I'll be ordering my own copy soon. Will I let my daughter listen to it when she reaches 12? Probably not, but you never know. She may figure out how the work the CD player one night when her mother and I are asleep...
B00003CXA2|5.0|Forrest Gump. I could name a million reasons why this movie is considered one of the best. Could it be because of the storyline? The fact that is was wonderfully written? Or could it be because Robert Zemeckis managed to get the crowd really thinking, \\"is that President J.F.K?\\". Whatever reason it is, it has definately got me hooked on this movie for life.<br />Directed by Robert Zemeckis (who also directed the movie \\"Contact\\"), it is set in Alabama where it focuses on a very special boy, a boy who has many changes to come. His name is Forrest Gump (played by Michael Conner Humphreys). At first, Forrest had to wear leg braces to straighten out his back. But what the eyes of the other kids saw in Forrest was just a \\"retard\\" except for one, who could see right through Forrest Gump and see just another kid trying to live. This one went by the name of Jenny Curran (Hanna R. Hall), who would soon become Forrest \\"very best friend\\". The movie starts from scratch, where Forrest is a kid right until the time he is a grown man. Forrest soon goes to College, graduates, enters the Army, where he meets his two other best friends (Ben Bufford 'Bubba' Blue, played by Mykelti Williamson, and Lt. Dan Taylor, played by Gary Sinise), owns a shrimp company, becomes a table-tennis professional, becomes a war hero and soon marries Jenny. All this happened because Forrest believed he could make it happen.<br />To me, Forrest Gump is the story about survival and belief. To believe in yourself, believing you can achieve anything you want to achieve if you try. To achieve goals, you must set them out but Forrest never set his goals out, he just made them happen which is another reason why this is one of the best films ever made.<BR>Forrest Gump managed to earn an Oscar for Best Actor (Tom Hanks), Best Director (Robert Zemickis), Best Picture, Best Visual Effects, Best Editing and Best Writing. Gary Sinise, who played Lt. Dan, managed to earn a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. What I found amazing about this endless film is the way Zemickis brought back alive the past. If you have seen the movie, you will definately remember the live footages of President John F. Kennedy, John Lennon of the Beatles, President M. Nixon and the late Alabama Gov. George Wallace. It was really interesting and impressing how Zemickis made it look like Tom Hanks was really there with them all.<br />Memorable scenes? Of course there is. You'll definately always remember two very catchy pick-up lines in this film- \\"Run, Forrest, Run\\" (as said by Jenny) and \\"Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get\\". The scene where Forrest's leg braces break off while running away from the bikers, where young Forrest unexpectedly says \\"HUH HUH HUH HUH\\" to the principal of the school, where older Forrest surprisingly ejaculates when his hand is placed on Jenny's breast, where Forrest rescues at least 6 soldiers from the battlefields, where Forrest introduces himself to Bubba saying \\"My name is Forrest Gump. People call me Forrest Gump\\" (LMAO), where Forrest jumps off his boat surprised to see Lt. Dan again, where Forrest plays football, where Forrest runs miles and miles, where Forrest asks Jenny to marry him, there's an endless list of memorable scenes.<br />Forrest Gump. Who else knows a movie that EVERYONE can enjoy? A movie with much power, enough power to bring tears to your eyes? A movie that is unforgettable? A movie that has that MANY memorable scenes? I, for one, sure can't think of any, which is why I rate this a definite 5 star movie. Get it or watch it, it is truly reccommended.
0345308239|4.0|In &quot;The March of Folly,&quot; Barbara Tuchman attempts to analyze the whys and wherefores of government's apparent insistence on the pursuit of policy that is contrary to its self-interest.  From the loss of Troy through the acceptance of the Trojan Horse to the corruption of the Renaissance Popes leading to the Reformation to the British losing the American colonies to America's military involvement in Southeast Asia, Tuchman searches for the common thread behind these disasters.  <br />Tuchman, as ever, gets the highest marks for her command of historical detail and for her clear, incisive writing style.  &quot;March of Folly&quot; is a lean, mean 400+ pages, unencumbered by extraneous or irrelevant details.  But while dense, Tuchman is always highly readable, making her one of the most accessible of the great historians.  Unlike so many histories, this is a book that can be enjoyed and understood outside of a library. <br />The only problem with the book is that by analyzing four exemplary exercises in myopia, Tuchman comes across as sadly shaking her head, saying &quot;You should have known better.&quot;  This tsk-tsking is generally warranted -- just look at the results of each episode -- but the book would have been better had Tuchman done more to acknowledge the relative ease of connecting the dots from her late 20th century vantage point.<br />Slight notes of superiority notwithstanding, Tuchman's thesis is a noteworthy one -- why do governments pursue policies contrary to their self-interest in the face of such (in hindsight) obvious evidence to the contrary?  Pride is, unfortunately, all too often a leading cause.  While Tuchman's analysis is necessarily weakest when dealing with the fall of Troy due to lack of source material, Tuchman's analysis of the other episodes is down-right masterful.  (For a more detailed Tuchman analysis of the American Revolution, check out her &quot;First Salute,&quot; a wonderful book.)<br />While Tuchman provides a decent grounding in each episode, and definitely enough to understand her thesis, the reader would obviously benefit from reading up a little bit on each episode prior to working through &quot;March of Folly.&quot;
B0001V07ZQ|2.0|I am one of those people who prefers to read the book before I watch the film.  It allows me to create my own imagery, instead of relying completely on the producer and director of the film.<BR> <BR>Having never read a Patrick O'Brien book, I went to the bookshop only to discover that The Far Side of the World is in the middle of a 16 book series.  Undaunted, I read the first seven books before watching the film.  I was completely captivated by the description, detail, and the relationship between Stephen Marturin and Jack Aubrey.<br />To my utter horror, the film was a mongrelized, cobbled, disjointed retelling of a number of O'Brien's books.  As I watched the film I remembered a 10 second blurb from the fourth book followed directly by a one minute conversation from the second.  Everything chopped up.  Everything out of order.  <br />To make matters worse the film focuses almost entirely on grand battle scenes and chases.  It does almost nothing to help people get a feeling for the conditions and relationships on a British man-o-war. <br />Where is the wit found in the books?  Where are the interesting reltionships?  The person who cast Stephen Marturin clearly did not read the books.  The fact that Stephen is in the intelligence business and became a ships surgeon to get around never seems to works its way into the story line.<BR> <BR>A cinematic spectacle perhaps, but not a great film.  Save your money, and buy the books instead.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly will go down in history as the example of how the race for ratings can end a splendid show.  The writing, the acting, the plotting, the entire package is there and it excels.  The show never fails to thrill.  I have lent out my copy and referred many to rent it and without exception the response is always &quot;Why did they cancel this show?&quot;.  Buy this set for your collection and hope that the movie being developed causes a resurgence of interest in this splendid series.
0060207051|5.0|This book is soft on the mind and soft on the feelings.  I've read it to all 7 of my children and passed out copies to many friends.  It does not stimulate or activate.  It does not make noise.  Rather it penetrates.  It honors the things around us and some of the things that aren't quite things.  It reminds us that we are part of something larger and that we can rest and sleep in peace.
6302763835|5.0|Tarantula is a highlight of the continuous stream of monster B movies produced in the 50s and 60s. This is the story of a lifelong scientist (Leo Carroll), who is attempting to produce technology for the world to benefit from. When he is attacked one night by one of his former partners, a mutated tarantula is set loose in an Arizona town. The town medical doctor (John Agar), realizes that life is at stake, and must find a way to destroy this creature before it is too late. The formula used to mutate the arachnid has produced fatal effects on humans, deforming and killing them in a matter of 4 days. <BR>     Jack Arnold's edge of your seat lore did not need to be remade several years ago. If they are planning to outdo the 1950's &quot;Tarantula&quot;, they should forget the idea right now. Movies just are not made like that anymore, and it just cannot be equaled by modern technology. Pick this horror film up, and you will discover why so many of these type of films were made in that time.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|As a former expat (I lived in Tokyo for a year), I was excited when I heard about this movie, because I thought that I would be able to relate to it. I found that Lost in Translation was utterly difficult to watch...it was horrible, and I felt more insulted by it than anything else.<br />Little clips here and there of the expat life, and completely stereotypical portraits of the Japanese don't exactly add up to a masterpiece, in my opinion. <br />A few people have mentioned that the movie has wonderful cinematography. Honestly, I didn't find anything special about the relationship between Murry and Johansson, nor did I feel that a particular plot developed during the entire movie. I also felt that the producers could have showed more of Tokyo...there's so much of the city that was left out, rather than focus on the bits of Japan that MIGHT make the audience laugh. Supposedly, this movie is a comedy, but honestly, I didn't laugh once. <br />Think twice before even watching this movie; it's one of the most boring ones I've ever seen.
B000001FYL|5.0|Everyone has a few CD's they just feel like they aren't whole, or clothed if they don't own them. For me Blaze of Glory is one of those. I got my first copy of this on cassatte way back when. I was about 14. I knew who Bon Jovi was of course, but had never been a huge fan, I'm still not. I unwrapped it, and popped it into my tape deck. I was floored. I loved every single song on it. I'd never had that before. So here's my breakdown of what I think of each song.<BR><BR>1. Billy Get Your Gun - Ok, this one is just very... Cocky... I think is the right word. I always liked this one for when I felt sort of upbeat and carefree. <br />That and it has a very cute meaning to me, my best friend in Jr. High and I were obsessed with the movie, and had seen it 20-30 times in a summer. One night I put this tape in when we went to sleep, and the second time through the tape, when it says &quot;I'll make you famous&quot; my friend woke up screaming for Billy not kill her.<br />2. Miracle - This reminds me of alot of those times in life when you think nothing will go right, and that it won't ever. But shows that you do need to hope, that some one will care and try to help.<BR>  <BR>3. Blaze of Glory - This one has always reminded me of half of my family. The way they live their life in the rodeo. That do or die attitude in a way..<BR> <BR>4. Blood Money - Just a sad song of lost friendship and betrayal...really sad.<br />5. Santa Fe - Slow, sad sounding, very... westerny to me.<br />6. Justice in the Barrel -  The opening to this makes it for me. Lou Diamond Phillips chanting. <BR>     <BR>7. Never Say Die - An upbeat song, very optimistic.<BR>    <BR>8. You Really Got Me Now - This one is just sorta bluesy and quirky, I like it!<br />9. Bang a Drum - This one is my favorite of all of the songs. I don't know why it just touches me.<br />10. Dyin' Ain't Much of a Livin' -It starts out with Kiefer Southerland, which is a bonus. And then it gets all dark and saddish... good stuff. <br/>11. Guano City - A bit of the score from the movie, I can't ever place where it goes. I don't think it goes to the Guano city scene, but I still like it none the less.
B000002TQV|5.0|I know it's a shame that I just bought this album almost a decade after it came out, but fortunately I did buy it. I can't really say that I am a true Radiohead fan since I don't have all their albums and am fairly ignorant when it comes to their songs, but The Bends is truly a beautiful piece of work. I rarely listen to CDs from beginning to end, but this one is a rare exception. I can actually listen to the whole CD and not be bored with certain songs.The album is filled with absolutely fantastic music and very profound messages.<br />I must say that I am having a difficult time believing that many people state that O.K. computer is better than The Bends. Maybe I am wrong. Maybe O.K. computer is better, but it will require me to listen to that album for long periods of time before it can, in my humble opinion, equal the beauty and complexity of The Bends.
0446310786|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS VERY RELAXING...AND I LOVED IT.  IT HAD QUITE A PEACEFUL SETTING, DISTURBED BY THE HARSH REALITY OF RACISM, EVIL, AND PREJUDICE.  I LOVED HOW IT WAS TOLD FROM A CHILD'S POINT OF VIEW.  ALSO, HOW ALL THE EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE CONCLUSION REALLY SUMMED UP WHAT THE CHILD (SCOUT) LEARNED.  AT THE END, SHE LEARNED ABOUT COMPASSION, FAIRNESS, EQUALITY, AND KINDNESS.  EVERY SO OFTEN, THIS BOOK HAD SOME SURPRISES AND IT REALLY DISGUSTED ME HOW MUCH HATRED THAT HUMANS HAD.  I THOUGHT THE TITLE WAS EXCELLENT, AND THE ENDING WAS SPECTACULAR.  I QUITE LIKED THE BOOK BETTER THAN THE MOVIE.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THE OUTSIDERS AS WELL, AS IT IS ALSO ABOUT CONFLICT BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF PEOPLE.  THE ENDING OF TKAM REALLY SUMMED UP THE STORY AMAZINGLY, AND THIS WAS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE NOVELS.
B00000DG1R|1.0|please dont listen to this awful new wave band from the eighties(one of the worst decades of music).it is cheesy horrible bands like this that had almost destroyed rock music till it was rescued by bands like pearl jam and soundgarden.Songs like girls on film,rio and wild boys sound dated and lousy and you will be well advised to avoid this crappy band who are thankfully defunct.my rating 0/10.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Beatles fans, take note: This is quite possibly the last time you'll ever see anything resembling a Beatles reunion.<br />To the prior reviewer who said this video made the hairs stand up on the back of her neck... well, that makes two of us.  When Paul McCartney strummed the first few chords of &quot;For You Blue&quot;, tears welled up inside of me, as if a longtime friend who was thought dead had somehow managed to find his way back home.  The same thing happened when the audience began clapping along with McCartney during the first half of &quot;Something&quot; -- this is probably the last time we'll ever see Beatles magic work its wonder on a live audience.  And &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;?  Clapton's last solo was so intense, it's the one and only time I've ever cried and broken a sweat, at the same time, just watching a music video.<br />And as for the other reviewer who said this video is &quot;forgettable&quot;, well, 200+ 5-star ratings out of 208 reviews speak for themselves.  His review in my opinion is wrong on all fronts -- music quality and video quality in &quot;Concert for George&quot; are stellar, and the design, production and editing of the show are nothing short of perfection.<br />Maybe he should forget about buying videos that feature the music of artists he really doesn't care for.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Big Fish is not for the dumb of mind.  There are so many metaphors in this movie, that you can watch it time and time again and still catch more.  Big Fish is about a son reconciling with his father, due to his father proclivities for telling tall tales.  But when you see the movie, you will see that they really aren't tall tales.  The whole movie is a metaphor describing life as an adult and what you heard of as a child.  For instance....if throughout your childhood, you were told of twins that were 'joined at the hip', you would then believe as an adult that those twins were literally joined at the hip.  The reality is different, of course, but not when you have come to hear the same description from age 3 to adulthood.<br />This movie bascially is one big lesson in life.  The past may not be what we remember, but it is how it is remembered that really is the key to living!  I highly recommend this movie to anyone!!!
B000267JQK|5.0|I just bought Disclaimer II yesterday, and I can't stop listening to it!  The best tracks are Gasoline, Fine Again, Pig, Sympathetic, and of course both versions of Broken.  I haven't gotten a chance to watch the DVD yet, but I plan to do it soon.  But if you are thinking about buying this CD, think no more, take it from me and go get it!
B00005JKOI|2.0|Pretty in Pink is truly one of the worst bratpack movies ever made.  Whiny Molly Ringwald has by this time thoroughly worn out her welcome; her perpetual pout, her eye-rolling and her generally sour disposition are extremely grating, all the moreso because she is in virtually every scene!  The only interesting thing about Ringwald's \\"performance\\" is her ever-changing haircolor (throughout the movie, her hair goes from strawberry blonde to dark auburn to nearly chartreuse back to strawberry blonde, and so on.  At least SOMETHING changed; her expression never did!).<br />Andrew McCarthy is the wimpiest \\"romantic hero\\" ever, and, like Molly, his expression never changes.  \\"Must remain bland\\" was surely his mantra throughout filming.<br />Jon Cryer plays \\"Ducky\\" (did YOU go to high school with anybody who had a nickname like that???) like a spastic goofball.  James Spader is wasted in a one-note role as \\"The Mean Snobby Guy.\\"  There's no end to the talent wasted in this film: Annie Potts and Harry Dean Stanton are also squandered in thankless, my-character-only-exists-to-showcase-Molly-Ringwald roles.  <br />As if all that's not annoying enough, Molly's character is the richest \\"poor girl\\" ever, with her own lilac-colored Kharman Ghia, an endless supply of funky vintage dresses, petticoats, sweaters, granny boots, and hats (if you think she picked all that swag up at Salvation Army, you're crazy), and her own phone complete with answering machine (no big deal now, but it was in the '80s).<br />The cherry on top is the fact that the dress Molly cobbles together and \\"triumphantly\\" wears to Prom is ugly.  Ugly, ugly, UGLY.  That's not just my opinion, either: I saw this dog in the theater, and people LAUGHED when she made her entrance.<br />Bottom line: if you're in the mood for a bratpack movie, watch 16 Candles or Breakfast Club, instead.
B000001EHS|3.0|Vault is Def Leppard's first greatest hits/best of collection. It was released in 1995, and covers the time period of 1981-1995.<br />In the late seventies and early eighties, Def Leppard was one of the top bands in the NWOBHM (New Wave of British Heavy Metal.) As the decade progressed, the band shifted toward a sort of pop-metal sound, but managed to keep their audience. As the band entered the nineties, they began to change their sound once again. At the record company's recommendation, the group released a greatest hits package. So, how exactly is this greatest hits collection the band released? If you want to see, keep reading.<br />Album: On Through The Night (1980)<BR>Tracks featured here: None<BR>Comments: There are NO tracks from On Through The Night - which is unforgivable. Although this album is drastically different from the band's later works, it is my favorite album they released. This means the cover lies - as it distinctly says that the set covers 1980. The omissions of masterpieces like Sorrow Is A Woman and the Overture is the ultimate sin! But what's really unforgivable is the lack of Hello America, a fairly popular song from the album, and the lack of Wasted, the band's first true single. Why?<br />Album: High 'N' Dry (1981)<BR>Tracks featured here: Bringin' On The Heartbreak (EDIT)<BR>Comments: The lone song from this album featured here is one of the band's finest compositions, but this is an edited version that fades out early and doesn't go into the Switch 625 instrumental. I'm also deeply disappointed that this was the ONLY track they chose from this album. Where are Lady Strange, Let It Go, and the title track? One of the things I hate most about this set is the lack of emphasis on the first two albums, and you can already see why.<br />Album: Pyromania (1983)<BR>Tracks featured here: Rock Of Ages, Photograph, Foolin,<BR>Comments: As I suspected, the big hits from this album were put on the album. Too bad they forgot one - Too Late For Love.Also, they didn't bother to put any of this album's underrated masterpieces on here, including Comin' Under Fire, Die Hard The Hunter, and Billy's Got A Gun. For shame.<br />Album: Hysteria (1987)<BR>Tracks featured here: Rocket (EDIT), Animal, Armageddon It, Hysteria, Love Bites, Pour Some Sugar On Me (EDIT)<BR>Comments: The band really went overboard with the Hysteria material - THIS IS HALF OF THE ENTIRE HYSTERIA ALBUM! And yet, the band managed to forget Women, the other of the seven hit singles. And like with the previous album, the band didn't do any underrated masterpieces. Where's Gods Of War, my favorite song from the album? Oh, and I almost forgot to mention that Rocket is an edited version! Pour Some Sugar On Me is an edited version as well, but it's the VIDEO edit, which is actually a longer and better version of the song, so its being edited is a GOOD thing. Hysteria is a good album, but this many songs is overkill.<br />Album: Adrenalize (1992)<BR>Tracks featured here: Let's Get Rocked, Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad<BR>Comments: Adrenalize was never too popular, so I'm not surprised to see its limited emphasis here. Let's Get Rocked was an excellent song choice, but I could care less for the other selection. Heaven Is and Make Love Like A Man (BOTH of which are on the UK edition of Vault) would have been better choices. <br />Album: Retro Active (1993)<BR>Tracks featured here: Two Steps Behind (Acoustic Version), Miss You In A Heartbeat (Acoustic Version)<BR>Comments: These are two pretty good acoustic songs, BUT THE ELECTRIC VERSIONS ARE WAY BETTER. Likewise, how could they omit the cover of Sweet's Action? The omissions of Desert Song and I Wanna Be Your Hero are also disappointing. Oh, well.<br />Album: [Other, non-album tracks]<BR>Tracks featured here: When Love And Hate Collide<BR>Comments: The band includes a new composition on this set. Sadly though, this new recording is really nothing special. Still, it' good to have it here as an extrafeature.<br />Overall:<BR>Overall, my final views of this compilation are quite simple - it falls flat in many areas. I strongly recommend that the Pyromania and Hysteria albums be your first Def Leppard purchase. However, if you're a casual fan and NOTHING MORE (and you never plan to be), Vault makes for a pretty good listening experience. Just don't expect the compilation to give you the whole story - it doesn't.
B00004VVNB|5.0|logan's run is a real gem. love the cast and the look of the film and it's a good dvd to have when you want to see something that's out of this world!
B0000AQVCL|3.0|I bought this one because of the single &quot;Are you gonna be my girl&quot;, good one for the radio. The whole album it is a copy of The Who, The Rolling Stones and The Beatles. If you are into late 60's music, you will find some riffs that will sound very familiar. If you are not, and you like this album, you better hear the real sound of that time, at least all of them were original at that time.
B000067J1Q|3.0|First off. Think you have seen the Sound of Music? Well you haven't. I thought I had, many times. Of course it was always around Xmas with the commerical breaks. But that is a much edited version. There are small but significant cuts everywhere in that version. So this is a great thing to have. My 3 stars relates directly to the lack of extras on the one disc. The movie is 5+ stars, but the lack of extras warrants the 3 stars.<br />So this is a must buy. Also the commentary is very good here. But given the price for this on Amazon, just buy the 2 set version. I got the one disc version at a very good price so it is not a bad buy. But for $6 more, why not enjoy the double DVD? This is a must get for any movie fan, and if you are not into the extras, by all means buy this one. This movie, like all of Rogers and Hammerstein's work is emotional without ever being fake or sentimental. It is full of sentiment and completely honest sentiment at that, but never sentimentality. It totally puts to SHAME almost every director and producer and writer working in Hollywood today. Complete and total shame and disgrace. Nothing coming out of Hollywood today can hold a candle to this. Entire director's careers with academy awards can't even begin to even compare to just this one movie. So get some version, especially if you have young ones. Sit them down, and let them experience what a real movie can be.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I don't want to bore you with a long review of a devastating film. It is just not necessary. This film rocks! Total over the top mayhem but with style and real suspense. It really takes skill to do a good action flick as can be evidenced by the ton of crap out there. But Quentin has mastered it. I just love this film and Uma is sooo hot. She is way hotter than those bimbos Paris, Britney, Christina, Electra and Pamela combined. She has heart and it is her heart that made this film the classic that it will be known as. I cared about The Bride through the whole film and fought with her in every battle. One of the most enjoyable films I have ever seen. Thank you Quentin and Uma.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|In light of the other reviews posted, most of the praise I could easily heap on this film would seem repetitive.  Normally I would let it go with an &quot;enough said&quot; and pass over the need to add my two cents if not for the inane review you are first assaulted with when you come to this page, courtesy of Jeff Shannon.  If I knew where he lived I'd soap his windows.<br />Mr. Shannon manages to touch on all the aspects that made this film great and slam dunk them with a negative spin.  Referencing Chaos Theory to Jurassic Park, as if the theory was only made relevant by Spielberg's film, is childish.  Some of us do not need to be pandered to in such a way Mr. Shannon, thank you.  Calling this film sordid is moralistic, feel-good rubbish.  It wasn't produced by Disney nor was it peddled to an underage crowd.  Such a categorization is heavy-handed to say the least.  You want sordid, pick up a Hershel Gordon Lewis film.<br />Overlook such self important prattle.  The Butterfly Effect is a must see film.  Yes, the images are disturbing and the plot unsettling for most; dark films are rarely given the praise they deserve unfortunately.  If you don't walk out of the theater with a smile on your face these days the movie is usually panned.  I think the nay saying critics, including Mr. Shannon, can easily fit into the &quot;they didn't get it&quot; camp.<br />Addressing the other critics of the film, who claim the produces of The Butterfly Effect reveled in perversion, I say they are missing the point.  Cause and effect is the main thrust and not once are the supposed \\"perversion\\" show in a glamorous light.  Each negative event causes a chain reaction of negativity.  From some of the reviews I've read you would think it was a two hour film of child pornographers giggling over their crack pipes while torturing small animals.  Bah!  Not so.<br />If  you're looking for the summer feel good film this is obviously not it ... but if you want to be entertained and forced tothink at the same time &lt;yikes, not that!&gt; then Butterfly Effect is the experience you need.  Agreeably there is some lack to seeing this film at home without the benefit of a THX theater, especially with the time-shift sequences, but the plot more than makes up for any lack of intensity outside of the theater.  Few films feel like a true \\"experience\\" ... as opposed to just watching a movie ... The Butterfly Effect is one of them.
B00006LPER|5.0|I spent 4 years at a music conservatory.  In my experience it was a hostile, competitive environment that stiffles creativity and love of music.  My teacher for my principal instrument was as cold, abrupt, unfeeling, and abusive as the character brilliantly potrayed by Isabelle Huppert. Watching this film made me feel like I was right back there and left me feeling nauseated that I had spent so much of my life in such an environment.<br />I got my degree and quit music - this film helped me remember why.<br />Five stars for realism.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|I used to think bands like Korn, Slipknot, Limp Bizkix, who ever else that was on MTV, and on the radio were real metal bands. Then I picked up a CD called Escape by a band called Ram-Zet. To my shock I heard something that was far more heavy then Slipknot, Adaem, Korn, etc. I started to find more and more metal bands that well big over on the other side of the Atlantic coudl not be found over here. <br />Then I found out way. It was because if some radio DJ tried to play a real metal band like Ram-Zet they would be fried for it. All because teenagers were not buying it. <br />Guys really a band dose not need nine people to make a band. Six to five people are just fine. Swearing does not make you a metal band. There are some that swear. But many of them do not. They add in things from new music, to old music, every thing. Metal music is far deeper then what you will find on a Slipknot CD.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|This is just a perfect CD. No bad tracks on here -- tight beats too.
B000069CWE|5.0|There are no negative aspects to this record , this is almost alike Trent Reznor's remix album's of all of the records he has recorded but with linkin park there more songs but the mintues that calculate all together are shorter than what Nine Inch Nails produced . Nine Inch Nails are a far better band than Linkin Park , that is a thing you people ahve to agree with me and Nine Inch Nails are like the creators of industrial music in  my own little world . <br />Overall , this album isnt bad but great . It's more different than Hybrid theory and consist of unsual parings .
B000001FGG|5.0|It's been said elsewhere...and it is worth repeating...This is an epitome of improvisational music from a group that was only in existence for a relatively short time. Although their musical differences and divergent directions that each took have been fairly well-documented, perhaps it was that same divergence that lent itself to their ability to stand on a stage and create at that given moment some pretty incredible music. Another one of those defining moment works...
B00005T30L|3.0|From reviews I'd read, I expected to be blown away by Ghost World--much the way I'd been blown away by American Beauty and Lost in Translation.  I wasn't.  It's a good movie, mind you.  Interesting characters who feel very genuine albeit somewhat one dimensional, and an odd tangle relationships.  It also very effectively captures the alienation of smart teens growing up in a world that seems populated by zombies of one kind or another.  So, it's very much worthwhile watching it--maybe more than once.  (I can't help but think of Thora Birch as a smart version of Kelly Osbourne from her dress and mannerisms in this movie.  But that's neither here nor there.)<br />So what's wrong with it?  What keeps it from being great?  In part, it's the almost relentlessly brooding tone that keeps the characters from being fully realized human beings.  Maybe, just maybe, there are people as unreliable, aimless, and alienated all the time--just like Thora Birch's character.  But do we really need a movie about someone who is so malignantly morose?  And no one else in the movie really picks up the slack, showing that intelligent people can be sharp and effective, as well as cynical.  Without that counterpoint, the story has a mushy center, and starts to get--well--a little boring.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I did not get to see this at the movies, so maybe that version wasn't quite as good as the one on DVD, but I can't believe the awful reviews I kept hearing about while it was in theaters!! This was one of THE BEST movies I have seen in a LONG time! The characters were totally believable, and are all exceptional actors, including the children. If you are prejudiced against Kutcher because of the whole Demi Moore thing (or for other reasons), then try to get past it and GO RENT THE MOVIE. I won't go into detail about the plot since so many other reviewers already have, but I highly recommend at least renting this movie, if not actually purchasing it. I just got done watching the rental, and plan on going out and buying my own copy tomorrow. If it weren't already midnight, I would run out and buy it right now. Enough said.
B0000YEEHG|5.0|I've never quite been into foreign films, but I decided to check out 'Persona' because it has been associated with one of my favorite films, Robert Altman's '3 Women.'  I was frequently told by other film buffs, &quot;If you like '3 Women,' you'll really like 'Persona.'&quot;<br />They were right, for I was completely blown away by this Bergman masterpiece.  'Persona' is a powerhouse of emotions, and the acting is superb.  Liv Ullmann's silence is extremely compelling, for her nonverbal communication conveys a whole lot more than any dialogue could relate!  Bibi Andersson's performance is heart-wrenching at times, for her persistance and confusion draws the viewer into her corner like a spider caught in a web.   <br />As far as Ingmar Bergman, I am now a dedicated fan of his films after viewing 'Persona.'  There were a few bits during the opening montage that made me wince (beware!), but after seeing the entire film, I can understand why they were there.  In addition, the visual look of some of the key scenes are among the most breathtaking I have ever seen in a film, such as the one where Liv almost floats into Bibi's room like a Nordic goddess.    <br />Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in Ingmar Bergman, arthouse cinema or films about the psychology of relationships.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I must really question the mental stability and cognitive stability of anybody who doesen't love this.
B000002UE9|4.0|I am so glad to see so many positive reviews for this fantastic, but unfortunately out of print CD. Each song is an 80's hair metal masterpiece. You will be tapping your foot and humming the chorus all day long to &quot;Love on the Rocks&quot; &amp; &quot;Back to the Rockin' Horse&quot;. Poison's charm was also probably the reason they faded so quickly. They provided the soundtrack for Strip Clubs, Drunken Parties, and back-seat quickies. There were never any &quot;heavy&quot; or &quot;deep&quot; songs. It really was about &quot;Nothin But a Good Time&quot;. If you haven't heard half of this album already, then you must have been born during the Clinton administration, because I know during the late 80's, this disk never left the turntable of radio station 98 Rock here in Baltimore. If you like Hair Metal and you don't own this album, or the only Poison songs you have are part of collection like &quot;Monster Ballads&quot;, then do youself a favor and pick this up. Big Hair, Loud Guitars, and women in spandex.....that is what Hair Metal is all about!!!
1573226521|4.0|I was highly suspicious of reading The Beach, having heard of it being 'a great film with De Caprio in it'. Not being a fan of Leonardo (this was before he starred in Catch me If you Can' etc etc.), I was going to give this a miss, before I got stuck in an aeroport and was forced to read it.<br />Garland creates beautiful scenery, great scenes of psychological and mental exploration, while touching on the ideas of the past, peace and ostricisation. The main character can be seen in many different lights; as both an idiot and a hero, as insane or perfectly normal, driven by a force stronger than himself.<br />So why not five stars?<br />In parts of the book, Garland does tend to drag out the sequences with Mr. Duck (read to understand!), and at the end I found myself wondering about what certain characters were actually like; his development of the background characters could have been better.<br />Despite these downfalls, Garland creates an excellent, fast-paced novel with an extremely sinister and well created ending. Definately worth a read
B00008DDSC|5.0|Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a disturbed young woman given to self-mutilation , just out of a stay in a mental institution.  She does a typing course and takes a job as a secretary to eccentric lawyer E. Edward Grey (James Spader).  She finds his exacting demands to her liking, and blossoms in his employment.  Thier mutual attraction is obvious.  She even acquires a nice but slightly wet boyfriend.  Then one night E. Edward Grey sees her flirting with her boyfriend in the launderette (American launderettes seemm to be much more glamorous than British ones) this sets off feelings of jealousy that leads to his fury at her spelling mistakes and the now-famous (and very sexy) spanking scene.  Their relationship blossoms and becomes more and more kinky (there is a wonderful scene where he puts a saddle on her and a carrot in her mouth and you can see the expression of absolute relish on her face).  But he is unable to cope with their growing intimacy and backs off, he starts treating her, as she remarks in disgust \\"just like a regular old secretary\\", even when, in desperation, she empties all her tipp-ex into the river.  Nice but wet boyfriend wants to marry her, and it looks for a while as if she is going to, but it's really Mr. Grey that she wants, and she is determined to do everything she can to get him.  This is an absolutely wonderful film.  James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal both give marvellous performances, the film has wit and charm and humour, and is the only film I've ever seen that treats a kinky relationship with such sympathy.  It has a wonderful ending too.  Absolutely delightful.
B00003CWPL|3.0|Ithink the surreal filming of Eraserhead made it all to real, it is horrifying to watch,even if you dont understand what is going on immediatly you cant stop watching . It seriously sets you thinking about the state of mind that creates such a film,one being was he an observer or the other had he experienced such a state of being tographicly get the message over so well.<BR>its a film about industrys greed and socioty suffocation,<BR>supressing the human values of life.<BR>i think everyone should see it once just so u can spot the eraserheads today,and have some understanding of how and why<BR>they end up being as they are. watched it once would not watch it again.
B000002H33|4.0|This band were on a roll but since they became sellouts  during the black album era i'm utterly discusted and embarressed.I used to be  a metallica fan i loved songs like,Seek and Destroy,Fade to Black,Damage inc and THE MIGHTY ONE,but during the ninties they have become an absolute disgrace lars is terrible on drums,james sounds totally awful,kirk looks like a fag and jason one of the biggest idiots in metal today.This is metallica finest effort for sure AND VERY SADLY THEIR LAST WITH CLIFF BURTON.It's a shame the poor soul carn't rest in peace i mean come on albums like load,reload,S and M and the horror st anger,it goes to show CLIFF was the main man in metallica and i know i sound cruel but i wish kirk died instead of  cliff I  REALLY DO.Why 4 stars its because metallica once said we will never go mainstream WELL WHAT HAPPENED YOU STUPID LYING FU KS.
B00005JKCH|4.0|I love Comic Book movie flicks and i am not a comic geek or anything i just find it amazing how 1 person can make a difference and use super powers and the mind blowing special effects instore.........anyways Spiderman starts the trilogy off good after your done watching this film it will leave you wanting more....Spiderman doesnt exactly make too many appearances in this film but he makes enough please the average spidey fan.......one thing i think is kinda a downer in this movie is that i think spidey and the goblin should have encountered each other more it would have made it alot better in this movie they only meet like 3 times in battle i think they should have met like 7 times at least<BR>anyways see this movie then go so spiderman 2
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|I think eminem is straight pimping in rapping. I think he got all the type of songs you can think of. Like from my band song [a happy song} to a hate song like how come. I think some people are just hating because he is not black like most of the rappers are and he is a rich succesful rapper. So all the haters leave eminem alone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JLXE|4.0|This movie is not a bad movie like many people put it to be i mean c mon its daredevil and daredevil shows alot in this film you dont have to wait an hour for him to appear only like 20 minutes anyways heres a good hero flick a dark one yes but good kinda reminds me of batman
630469654X|4.0|I loved the movie, but the Disco Fever music had to go. Otherwise its a great story.
B00009V7OL|3.0|This edition of the DVD (paper boxed, white) does NOT have a 5.1 soundtrack. The picture remains letterboxed, not anamorphic, and it still carries the THX certification, though it is not marked so on the box. If you can, obtain the original Special Edition release in plastic case with black cover, it has the 5.1 soundtrack. If, like me, you are still waiting for the proper anamorphic release of The Abyss, this is NOT IT, it is simply an inferior repackaging.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|This was one that our boys (ages 7 and 10) watched with their grandfather, who caught it in the theatres when it first came out.  It's hard to say who enjoyed it more! A fun, spirited and utterly charming film, this one has aged beautifully.  Everyone loved the bonus features, too.  The DVD transfer is exceptional. Add some popcorn, and you've got a wonderful mulitgenerational hit that will enchant the whole family.
B0000CEB4V|4.0|I always was a George Harrison fan. He always seemed underrated in the Beatles,and after,but from the many booksI read he seemed like a very kind,gentle soul. What you might ask does this have to do with this dvd,well Eric Clapton is on this dvd, often seen talking and helping George's son play for this concert.The fact that it is commonknowledge  to any George or Eric fan, that Eric broke up George's first marriage,and then married  Pattie Harrison. Prior to this happening they were best friends. Eric Clapton often expressed remorse that he hurt hid best friend,George being a bigger man was glad his first wife Pattie was with a nice person. So the 2 of them remained best friends,until George's death.        to watch the happiness that Georges son gets from playing with other famous musicians is worth the price. He looks like a young George, and it was a good concert and some great behind the scenes items that are very touching.Anyone who enjoyed George's music will enjoy this dvd.
B00008J4P5|5.0|... rough, varied, and rockin.'<br />This is the first and so far only White Stripes album I've heard. I heard \\"Seven Nation Army\\" on the radio, and decided I had to buy it.<br />First: Reading several harshly negative reviews here about Meg and Jack White's limited technical talent reminded me of an argument I once heard about who is more \\"talented,\\" techno-artist Moby or the old Canadian rock trio Rush.  One debater asserted that the members of Rush \\"really know how to play their instruments,\\" while Moby mostly programs electronics.  Therefore, he argued, the members of Rush have more \\"musical talent.\\"<br />However -- Rush has a limited cult following, and are an acquired taste at best.  Whereas Moby puts out some really catchy, melodious and/or haunting songs.  That has to count for something.  It ain't all technical virtuosity, folks.<br />What I liked about this CD is (1) it's catchy but raw, never bubble-gummy poppy -- I have a low threshold of pop -- and (2) the variety of styles displayed. Like head-banging garage rock? Blues? Ballads? Folk? It's all here. <br />1) Seven Nation Army: Great opener. Maybe Meg \\"can't play drums,\\" but that doesn't stop this song from pounding itself into your head forever.<br />2) Black Math: This rocker grabs you by the ears and forces you to bob your head violently. Faintly Led Zepplinesque.<br />3) There's No Home for You Here:  Intro somehow reminded me of the Beatles. Not bad, but I didn't like it as much as most other tracks.<BR> <BR>4) I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself: Softer, OK.<br />5) In the Cold, Cold Night: Meg sings this bluesy, sexy, smokey, slower number.<br />6) I Want to Be the Boy Who Wins Your Mother's Heart: A guy is afraid his girlfriend's mother doesn't like him, so he becomes desperate to impress her -- the mom, that is. An offbeat, sweet, sad-funny little ballad.<br />7)You've Got Her in Your Pocket: Nice song, but frankly I find it somehow depressing and don't listen to it much.<br />8) Ball andBiscuit: Remember when George Thoroughgood and the Destroyer's took a simple blues riff and made a rockin' song out of it with \\"Bad to the Bone\\"? White Stripes does something \\"similar but different\\" here. Very bluesy in a loud sort of way.<br />9) Hardest Button to Button: Liked. This is where I start to overuse the words \\"rockin'\\" and \\"rocks.\\"<br />10) Little Acorns: Goofy intro, but it rocks.<br />11) Hypnotise: Maybe my favorite after \\"Seven Nation Army.\\" There's something retro about this rocker -- the earlier reviewer who said it somehow reminds him/her of \\"Secret Agent Man\\" may be onto something.<br />12) The Air Near My Fingers: I confess, I've listened to this CD a hundred times, and I remember nothing about this track.  I guess it failed to grab my attention.<br />13) Girl, You Have No Faith in Medicine: My 3rd favorite. A rocker that's also faintly retro. Maybe that's just from Jack yelling \\"Whoo!\\"<br />14) It's True That We Love One Another: In a change of pace, Holly Golightly joins the Stripes for some goofy, folky fun.<br />I love this CD. Maybe I'm just unsophisticated.
0783226063|3.0|This Dino DeLaurentis production of Frank Herbert's 'Dune' is perhaps one of the more unusual science fiction movies out there.   I love this film for its visual style and appeal; It is a future where thinking machines are outlawed and depicted in an italian renaissance style.   The actors, some quite noteworthy, fit into the style of this film.     This film has received most criticism for its distortion of the plot and poor character development.   I don't mind this too much; it is an intertaining and grand film.        DVD EDITION: What bothers me is the recording format for this DVD.  Resolution is compromised because it is letterboxed and is truly a waste to see on wide aspect televisions.  Making it fit the screen compromises resolution quite a bit; this is why I only give it 3 stars, when as a film it deserves more.  I wish Universal would release a dual layer edition with proper 16:9 screen support.  Also, the transfer has poor contrast and has some artifacts.     NEW! BLU RAY EDITION:   The high resolution detail is very good and I'm able to see things I never could before.  The print is grainy with intermittent defects on the far right of the picture.    The main thing that is strange about this cheaply made BLU-RAY edition is that the sound mastering is very strange.  Incidental sounds such as shoes shuffling and knocks are too loud while music tracks are too low.  The overall effect is like watching a screening room print or watching a TV recorded theatrical production from masterpeice theater in the 1970's but with good resolution.     Some of you may opt for the recent Sci-Fi channel mini-series.  It does address this film's flaws but it can be an awful flog to sit through such a long production.  The miniseries lacks the awe inspiring and unusual visual style of David Lynch's Dune; for this reason alone I recommend this title.
B00018D44U|4.0|I find this album to be a nice follow-up to &quot;Come Away With Me.&quot;  Norah Jones blends country and jazz effortlessly, and this is a find for anyone who enjoys both.  My favorite track is the last one, &quot;Don't Miss You At All.&quot;
B0000DD7LB|1.0|This is a horrible album by a horrible singer. The only reason it's even remotely listenable is the magic done by producers to mask Britney's horrendous voice. Mandy Moore has more talent in a fiber of hair.
B0000VAFO0|2.0|Yet another addition to the ever-expanding library of films that serve generous heapings of steaming visuals but with little or no seasoning such as, oh, plot, excitement, suspense, character, or heaven forbid, depth.<br />The premise is actually interesting: Vampire and Werewolves are not friendly with each other.  This movie suggests that it's a conflict dating back centuries.  Okay, I'm willing to buy that, as long as the dialogue and characters aren't culled from a horror-genre parts bin.  Give me something hand made!<br />Selene is a vampire, trained to hunt and kill the lycans (werewolves, why not just call them that?).  Then one day she hunts down a lycan she happens to fall in love with.  Ah, is that a wiff of Romeo and Juliet I smell?  No.  Nothing of interest happens there; they talk about a lot of stuff, none of it very exciting.  There are some people in long, flowing leather jackets waking through double-doors over and over and over again in slow-mo.  Whoa!  Then there's some Matrix-esque stuff that doesn't resemble the Matrix.  In the end, she kills the head lycan dude, just like in a video game, by cutting him in half with a ninja sword, he takes forever to actually sever in half and die, and the whole Women's Liberation movement takes one step backwards as Kate Beckinsale tries to look murderous.<br />It's a pity we've reached a point where our &quot;subculture genre&quot; is becoming infused with mainstream trappings.  I suppose it's analogous to Metallica's &quot;Black Album,&quot; but really it's more to do with the marketing to youngsters who imagine themselves on the fringes of &quot;the norm&quot; as we used to call it and dress like they're different and shunned.  Just walk into any &quot;Hot Topic&quot; store and feast your eyes.  Being on the outside is in.
0312995423|1.0|In Digital Fortress, Dan Brown violates laws of physics, mathematics and common sense page after page. The author displays a blatant lack of knowledge in both cryptography and computer science in his creation of a plot more reminiscent of a cheap action movie. A stream of coincidences fuel the story all throughout the book and lack of character development results in single dimensional characters who, despite their advertised genious, behave with room temperature IQs.<br />To enjoy this book, read it as a comedy.
B000001Y5X|5.0|This album is brilliant. Personally I am a huge fan of Manson's music and respect all of his beliefs and opinions and for me this is his greatest achievment.<br />look inside, look at the photos on the get your gunn and lunchbox singles, THIS is what Manson is to me. This album is full of punky energy and anarchistic sentiment. It manages all the things the other albums were capable of, but because of the lack of any sort of prop other than these guys were pretty weird, the messages are delivered far more brutally and without any  over the top theatrical metaphors. That's not to say this is a faulted work because of it's, some might say, immaturity.<BR>This album is the Manson I know and love. I heard dope hat and then get your gunn and my life changed. I was young (about twelve) so many of the lyrics flew right over my head, but i loved the sickness of it all, the depravity, the ability of a group of guys to make something that makes you feel dirty and almost violated as you listen to it. This power really intrigued me at this age (and arguably led  to my taste for the more extreme sides of the musical spectrum)<br />This Manson didn't need enormous burning crucifixes, thousand pound stage get-up, or hoardes upon hoardes of teenagers to scare the world. This Manson achieved all this in the truest sense possible. They managed to frighten America, and soon, the world. They managed to disgust and become reviled. How many current Manson fans didn't first give them a listen because they were &quot;evil&quot; <br />Now it's all changed, as oppsed to being an institution worth worrying about, Manson has become a joke, billions of teenagers replicating his sentiments, not having a clue what they actually mean. The band has become overwrapped in drama and pretentiousness. They're still good.<br />But the blistering assault of Misery Machine,the truly creepy Dope Hat and Wrapped in Plastic, and the resentment filled/fuelled Get Your Gunn are tunes that truly make the listener pay attention.<br />The majority of Manson fans first discovered them during Antichrist or Mechanical Animals. THIS is the only true Manson album in my opinion. <br />It's far harder to get your point across when no one's listening. This is the sound of a band trying and succeeding to do this.
B00005JM0B|5.0|...but I thought wrong!  This movie was as good or better than part 2.  This movie makes this whole trilogy make sense.  When I saw part 2 about a decade+ ago, I thought how could a robot change form, that's just pure fantasy or magic.  But with the advent of nanotechnology, it's possible in the future to do so.<BR>Plus, if Skynet was destroyed in part 2 how could Judgement Day be inevitable?  I don't want to give out spoilers, but it's called the &quot;internet&quot; and distributed computing where there is no single stand-alone supercomputer, etc...<BR>And how could John Connor be a shrimp and save the future?  Well,  you'll find out near the end.  One clue... again, &quot;Communications&quot;, the key to all wars, without it you're as blind as a bat...  This movie has superb high rate, mindblowing special visual and audio FX!  This movie sets the new standard in special effects and Sci-Fi storytelling (whereas other Sci-Fi movies failed... Star Trek??)
B0002BO0AS|5.0|First off I have been an Unearth fan since &quot;The Stings&quot; album. Let me tell you not only does this surpass that but it is simply the best metal release of the year. They really kicked it up a notch! The album will blow your mind!!!!!!!!The riffs and drumming left me in aw!!
B000002GJH|5.0|And I say that without the slightest shred of pretense or hype. I bought this CD the day it came out in 1991, and through the ensuing 13+ years it has just kept getting better.<br />I find it frankly mindboggling that anyone lacking the musical sense to appreciate this album would bother reviewing anything but their own reasons for continuing to live.  Every single note is deeply emotive and powerful; I can't think of a single album I liked more since, and prior...I'd have to go back to Zeppelin at least, and maybe even to Sgt. Pepper.<br />Knowing the backstory of the album just makes it even more powerful.  Those who dismiss it as pretentious or self-absorbed can be no more than emotionally crippled automatons living in a dull gray world of banality and mediocrity; nothing else could explain such an attitude toward this wonderful 55 minutes.<br />When the Stainds and Nicklebacks and Days of the News and Limp Bizkits and Creeds (*spit*) of the world are nothing more than long-forgotten and painful memories of a bad parody of real music, this genuine, heartfelt, quality rock, played from the soul and with ridiculous levels of talent to boot, will remain as the little unheard-of album that set the standard for decades to come.<br />Today's crop of corporate-constructed, mass-produced dreck don't even possess the presence of mind to know that they should pray to whatever diety they hold dear that maybe someday they might get lucky and create something with a thousandth of the power, talent, and value of this incredible album.
B000003TAL|5.0|Sonic Youth's early 80's efforts possessed screeching, unorthodox guitar workouts, never really seen or heard beforehand, and passionate, off-kilter vocals, all of which turned off as many fans as it attracted. It could be said that the band's fourth LP, 1986's &quot;EVOL,&quot; and their critical breakthrough, 1987's &quot;Sister,&quot; were formative works for Sonic Youth, indicating a significant shift from atonal, hook-less white noise bursts to structured sets of songs. However, even today each of these respectable records pale in comparison to the band's 1988 masterpiece, &quot;Daydream Nation.&quot; It might be the case that &quot;Sister&quot; and &quot;EVOL&quot; would stand alone as magnificent, influential albums if it were not for this release, but after one experiences &quot;Daydream Nation&quot;'s excellence, the former appear almost insignificant.<br />&quot;Daydream Nation&quot; begins with the most accessible song Sonic Youth recorded in the 80's, the sonorous &quot;Teen Age Riot.&quot; Laced with multiple hooks and affecting lyrics, the opener is this album's guidepost, presenting listeners with a caricature of the band's principal innovation: the combination of melody and instrumentation with fury and disorganization. From there, expansive tracks such as &quot;The Sprawl,&quot; &quot;'Cross the Breeze,&quot; &quot;Total Trash,&quot; and &quot;Trilogy&quot; conjoin beautiful, haunting passages with strident vocals and thrashing guitars, while songs like &quot;Candle,&quot; &quot;Hey Joni,&quot; and &quot;Silver Rocket&quot; are more succinct, hooky jaunts which enthrall the listener while battering his or her ear drums like a punching bag. Oftentimes, the album relinquishes control, as guitarists Lee Ranaldo and Thurston Moore weave and wind their axes into what seems to be total oblivion, eschewing convention and normalcy for avant-garde experimentation and the musical equivalent of a nervous breakdown. Nevertheless, unpredictability may be Sonic Youth's chief strength and distinguisher, and on occasions when it is displayed, they traverse where no band before them dared to go.<br />In many respects, &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; is the 80's best rock album. It may not be its most influential, but it certainly ranks with Husker Du's &quot;New Day Rising&quot; or the Pixies' &quot;Doolittle&quot; in terms of its originality and presence, which could be observed many years after its release. In essence, it's unquestionable that &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; is a definitive must-have milestone...it was the future of rock in 1988, and today it remains as relevant and fresh as ever.
B0001Z2RUK|5.0|Throw in part Radiohead , A splash of Morissey ,A Touch of Muse, &amp; A Pinch Of Depeche Mode ,And you end up with Keane.<BR>There are Vast facets of love in This Peice of superb &amp;Unique work. The Cd takes you on an emotional rollercoaster of Love,Loss,Hopes &amp; Fears. There is alot of melancholy feelings of Lost Love iced with a proclaimed hope of just being loved. <br />This is truly one of the most moving CD I've heard in along time!<BR>From the popular Love Song &quot;Somewhere only we know(#1)&quot; <BR>To the lilting professions of love on &quot;Bedshaped(#12)&quot;Which is my personal favorite of the whole Cd.<br />Branching out to &quot;We might as well be strangers(#3)&quot; A Sorrowful Story of a familiar couple ,as they live each day as the last &amp; the next, taking for granted what Love is.<br />&quot;She has no time(#6) &quot; is a beautiful peice,of tragic desire for the one that got away.<br />&quot;This is the last time(#9)&quot; Is a bitter sweet kiss goodbye .<br />This album is a awesome mix of Electronic Expression ,&amp; Acoustic Laced Ballads.<BR>This is a must have for any collection!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0001Z52RU|3.0|I was so excited to see this movie, and it was good and mysterious until you figured out what was happening. It then got a little tedious. Kutcher can't act, which doesnt help the movie. Many better movies to tweak the brain.
B0000028RR|5.0|Their self-titled debut would prove to be Rage Against the Machine's best effort, though they hardly slipped over the ensuing years and albums.  This is a classic in the truest sense of the word:  it begs you to pull it out of your collection at least 2-3 times a year, and it represents some of the best music from its time and place.  RATM reminds you that the best music SAYS SOMETHING, whether it's politically-motivated or just something the artist feels the need to share with their audience.  Rage's blend of incendiary metal riffing (courtesy of Tom Morello's groundbreaking guitar work), pounding drums, and scream-in-your-ear agenda-pushing lyrics was powerful, unique, and uncompromising.  This is an essential album for anyone that listens to message-heavy music.
B000002MFN|5.0|Who would have thought a simple material girl could evolve into such an attractive woman/singer?<br />Despite all the negativity this album has recieved, Erotica is truly another turning point for Madonna.  There are only a total of about four or five songs that actually have to do with sex.  The rest deal with emotions, relationships, spirituality, etc.  This is a definite buy if you're a beginner Madonna fan.  <br />Don't just listen to the negative comments, judge it for yourself for once!
B0001HLVSC|5.0|MASTER AND COMMANDER fulfilled all of the hype and advertisements that preceded the film. Russell Crowe, as Capt Jack Aubrey, delivered an outstanding performance. The supporting characters were also well chosen and compelling.<br />This fast paced story takes place in the early 1800's and begins and ends with riveting sea battles fought between English and  French warships.  The music was lovely and haunting.  I found all of the characters to be realistic and the story to be memorable.<br />Well done!
0156027321|4.0|Yann Martel's novel about Piscine Patel is a treat.  Mr. Martel tells the story in such a way that a reader who skims could mistake it for nonfiction, and it is almost beguiling enough to convince you that it is real.<br />Magic?  Delusion?  Sensory deprivation?  One could argue that Life of Pi is a fable, or perhaps an allegory, or something else.  It is part survival-at-sea, part memoir, and part meditation.<br />Pi Patel believes in Hinduism, Christianity and Judaism; his forays into each provide the book with part of its structure in the beginning.  Tidbits of wisdom are also nestled in his father's lectures on how to care for the animals in his family's zoo.  Some of the animals board a boat with them, slated to leave India; it is this menagerie that ends up on a lifeboat with Pi when a boat accident kills his family.  In the rest of the novel, Pi must struggle to survive, pitted against the elements, an absence of provisions, and an enormous tiger named Richard Parker.<br />There are scenes that will make your stomach churn, scenes to make you laugh, and an ending that will certainly make you think - to say nothing of surprising you.
B000002MUN|5.0|This is my favorite album of all of Tom Petty's catalog and out of almost every CD in existance.<br />Why do I think that? Every song strikes a chord with me. I first heard it when it first came out and I liked it just as much then, but recently I've been listening to this album alot lately. All I gotta say is listen to the intro to &quot;Crawling Back To You&quot; and see how gripping that piano and guitar melody is. Buy this amazing piece of work right now! I said so!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Posthumus tribute concerts can be a tricky proposition in the wrong hands: observe the several ill-advised John Lennon tributes, featuring singers and musicians he never knew, and would never respect. This concert is different. George Harrison's best friend, Eric Clapton, organized the event, and invited only people who knew George, and had worked with him in the past. The resulting concert is tasteful and off-beat, respectful and completely entertaining.<br />Ravi Shankar is a featured speaker, but there are very few words in the concert. There are some incredible performances of George's music, including Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers rendition of the Traveling Wilburys 'Handle With Care', Paul McCartney's ukelele-to-full orchestra with Eric Clapton on vocals version of 'Something', and Paul and Eric's show-stopping version of 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps.' There are also the other things George loved: Indian music and Monty Python's Flying Circus. When the Indian orchestra, conducted by Anushka Shankar, segues into the Pythons doing 'Sit on My Face' you know you are in the right place. George Harrison had an eclectic variety of interests, he made great melodies, and everything is on display here.<br />I can honestly say I think George would have loved this concert, because it is an honest display of affection and respect for an artist who never took himself too seriously.
B00000F169|5.0|Made with their own money! John Carpenter and Dan O'Bannon made this quite bizarre tale of boredom in space. The crews mission is to blow up planets but other than that they have no life, they have been doing this for so many years they can't even remember their first names.  Their captain is dead, well frozen!, They have a beach ball for a pet, and their ship is falling apart. One of the most interesting bits in the film is when they have to philosophise with a talking bomb to stop it from blowing up the ship.  The score is excellent and the special effects....well they were made on the cheap. :)<br />Jack Harris wanted the original college film to be extended to 90 minutes, so that he could release it. So, John Carpenter and Dan O'Bannon completed the film but unfortunately their friendship did not survive the involvement of Jack Harris.
B0000024JA|5.0|If you love Hip-Hop, this is as hot, high, intuitive, addictive...as it gets.<br />Get it ASAP, this album is timeless, it never gets old. Best Wu-Tang solo album ever, along with &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx,&quot; and &quot;Liquid Swords.&quot;<br />Tical (Method Man) is simply UNTOUCHABLE, UNSTOPPABLE, AND DELIGHTFUL.<br />One word: Salaam!
B0001WTUH6|1.0|This is a fun action movie - this review is not of the movie itself, but the \\"unrated\\" DVD version. There is nothing in this film that would change the rating anyway - it's just schlocky marketing of the worst sort.      The extras are a joke, but the commentary is pretty decent. The extra film footage is just some gratuitous sexual footage (and precious little of that) about a sub plot we already knew existed in the theatrical version of the film! The ending of the extended cut of the film also allows for a sequel, something that just ISN'T going to happen. I think they knew that, which is why they made the ending of the theatrical release different.       THERE IS NOTHING NEW IN THE FILM THAT WARRANTED A SPECIAL RELEASE!      Again, I liked the film, but this product is a complete ripoff at the price they're charging.       Buy the much less expensive theatrical release.[...]

B000002J1S|5.0|I have been doing reviews for quite a time now but have only just plucked up the courage to do a genesis review. I suppose I've been putting it off because they are such a complex band that there is so much to talk about. Well here it goes... and by the way, don't be put off by the seemingly negative beggining.<BR> I have always felt that to say that both Lamb lies Down and Pawn Heart by Van Der Graaf Generator are in the same catagory of music is a little odd. Both termed as prog (progressive) rock they sound as different from each other as Chuck Berry does from 50 Cent. I feel that prog should sound raw and, well, weird. But this doesn't. It almost sounds like a musical in places. There are several pop rock tracks, Counting Out Time and Lily White Lylith being two of them. This sounds like a really polished epic... and it is. <BR> Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not writting this to say Genesis lost their way. Far from it. This is a great, stunning album, the last good one they'd make. I'm writting this to tell you that this isn't Foxtrot, Trespass Selling England by the Pound etc. This is a tight, all action album full of great, mostly under five minute, songs. It still has the Genesis sound of before and if you like their work prior to this you will enjoy this album. <BR> Now then, I'll just talk of the epic part without explaining it, thus ruining the first time experiance for you guys as other reviews have done. In fact there is no one story within this album. It can be interprated as a face value story, or as whatever you want it to be. It is about a guy apparently called Rael who, one way or another is lost. That is all I shall say, although I'm sure that by the song titles you should be able to guess that a lot weird things happen. <BR> To sum up, if you have enjoyed Genesis albums up until this, those being From Genesis to Revelation (almost a Cat Stevens album) Tresspass (beggining to get that Genesis sound, but Mr Stevens is still prodominent) Nursery Crime(an odd almost post-Lamb Lies Down sounding album) Foxtrot (there's that sound) and Selling England by the Pound (when they are, in my opinion, on top form) I recommend all of these by the way. If you enjoy  albums after this, I think you will find this to be far superior as Peter Gabriel made Genesis. When he left they just did a few empty prog albums before turning rock pop. All the same you should enjoy this whether this is a first Genesis buy or your last.<BR> I hope I've given valid advice.<BR> Toodle Pipskie (is that how you spell it?)
B00005JLEU|5.0|This movie feels like a dream. There are not many works of art that can do this, but with this one I distinctively got the feeling that watching this film was the same as a really sweet dream. I love it.
B00005JKN9|5.0|This was a dream project for master filmmaker Martin Scorsese,<BR>the genius behind such classics as Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and<BR>Taxi Driver. He read Herbert Asbury's novel back during the 1970's, when he made his breakthrough film Mean Streets, which<BR>put him on the map as Hollywood's newest talent, along with the<BR>great directors like Francis Ford Coppola, Robert Altman, and<BR>Roman Polanski. He envisioned this type of film ever since, and<BR>when it was released it opened to mixed reviews, some including<BR>Chicago Tribune critic Michael Wilmington praised it like he does with a lot of Scorsese's films, others said it dosen't quite live up to his past great works. My opinion personally is<BR>I loved it. Sure it may not be the crowning achievement we were<BR>hoping for, but this just like most of Marty Scorsese's other<BR>films, this one is an example of a director, whose filmmaking<BR>powers never fail to amaze me. Plus Daniel Day Lewis controls the ambitious gangster epic with his electrifying portrayal of a<BR>brutal gang leader which happens to be his third best performance of his career his first two are Jim Sheridan's My<BR>Left Foot and In The Name Of The Father.<br />I will talk later, just see this excellent movie.
B000268QB2|5.0|I discovered Keane after listening to KCRW's in-studio sessions. Their sound is refreshingly honest and the melodies are simple and powerful. Now for the dreaded what-do-they-remind-you-of piece: I don't hear the Coldplay influences as strongly as an undercurrent of vintage Smiths and early Tears for Fears. An absolutely great CD for Brit-pop fans...
B0000AMRJC|1.0|This movie is overrated and Al Pacino's performance is too phony. See The Godfather films instead.
0316168815|4.0|I agree with some reviewers who became a bit disenchanted when the main character of this novel, Susie, leaves heaven and lives in someone else's body on Earth for a few hours.  However, this is a minor shift away from what I think is a gripping, unique, well thought out, well written tale.  It has fascinating characters that grow and develop while remaining consistent enough over the years covered by the plot. <br />The premise of a murder victim viewing her familiy, friends and murderer from &quot;her heaven&quot; works amazingly well for me.  This is a book about characters.  The people, their relationships, and their transformation over time is the focus throughout.  This is where Sebold's brilliance shines.  In this context, it could be O.K. that Susie inhabits Ruth's body for awhile.  Perhaps crossing over in both directions could happen.....  But, I think that it is cool to think that both girls/women need to experience the other side.<br />I would like to have known more about Sebold's vision of heaven and what happens to the souls who inhabit it.  What is the relationship between the two sides of existence?  There were hints, but I stayed curious - not in a thoroughly thought provoking way.   <br />The story is a bit gory in spots.  It also has some cleverly developed suspense.   I consider myself pretty sensitive to negativity in books, but I was more than O.K. with this one.<br />Highly recommended!
0783229321|5.0|Animal House is undoubtedly a classic movie, the person who compared it unfavorably to American Pie is an idiot.  I'm buying the DVD soon, and I want to know if the new addition is better than the collectors edition released awhile back.  Can anyone tell me?
B0001AP12G|5.0|This is without a doubt, one of the best cd's I've heard all year!! Like a few of the 600 reviewers mentioned earlier, THIS IS REAL HIP-HOP!!! This is real music and deserves the credit that it has gotten. What really makes me glad is that MTV is playing his videos in regular rotation. Yes, his lyrics need a little work (he said that himself), but the beats are spectacular and really help to carry the album. Matter of fact, I could see this as being a classic in about 10 years. <br />Overall, one of the best albums of the year and should definitely be nominated at next year's Grammy's.<br />(P.S.: Congratulations to Kanye West for recently going 2X Platinum with this album!!)

B00009TB5G|3.0|I have seen all three films in theatre and own the Fellowship on the 4 DVD special edition... To make a film on this scale is an achievment .. more than 7 years spent and the results show.. unfortunately i disagree with those who call it a masterpiece.. It is boring.. plain and simple.. as an aspiring screenwriter i find that any film which relies so much on CGI and believes filmgoers come solely to see fantasy/action sequences and not hear a story is taking us for granted.. the book has a superb sructure. will not discuss it here.. but it slowly builds up and takes you on the journey with the characters.. every character from Aragorn to merry and pippin are shaped so well by Tolkien.. The film fails becasue it does not have a structure which involves the audience.. We are just taken through a series of action pieces in the first film.. the second film does better but not much while the third film-climax is more absorbing but because of the first two stinkers a first timer loses the plot.. On my own part I loved the Arwyn-Aragorn story, the scene where she sees him and thier child is possibly my favourite moment in the film.. pure cinema.. wordless and says everything.. A few personal notes of why you may want to pick up the DVD.. the making of the film is nothing short of amazing.. the DVDS 3 and 4 are chock pakced with info about the pre-prod, prod and post and are must have for thier extensive detailing about the prokject.. well worth the money to anyone who wants to find about the hardwork and effort that goes into making a film.. Should the lord of the Rings have been written by a professional screenwriter who understands the craft and structure of an epic.. which is what the LOTR is.. YES.. I think Peter Jackson is a brilliant filmmaker and his hardwork shows but him and Franz Walsh shine through in only certain moments when they don't let the CGI steal the human element from the film.. Having said that pick up the DVD, at that price it's a steal whether you're a lord of the rings afficiando or just a lover of films... On my own part I would have loved the LOTR as a series of six films with each book being divided into 2 parts and each part at 3 hours.. it would have been a more fulfilling experience.. but then that's what i think...
6304698526|4.0|This detective drama aimed to be the essence of cool, and succeeded, in fact it's a little too cool, can somebody turn up the thermostat?  Barely anybody in the picture is allowed to show any genuine emotion, although one of the hoods looks a little upset before he's shotgunned.  Director Peter Yates apparently planned to tell the whole story with action and came up with a near-classic.  In fact his spectacular staging of McQueen's car pursuit of two Mob assassins is usually blamed for the countless imitation car chases that have blighted American movies ever since.  It's certainly one of McQueen's signature roles, but why give him a hokey name like Bullitt?
B000002NHN|4.0|Hi guys and girls, i just want to say a big 'thanks!' to Amazon for showing me the wonderful talented Loreena, i have always liked this kind of stuff, and my favourite has to be Enya, but she hasn't released anything new for a while, and i have all of her CD's. Anyway, Loreena is a wonderful singer and her songs are just magical. I say that if your into Enya or anything like that - give Loreena a go - she will surprise you:)
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Having read countless comparisons to Radiohead, and being an avid listener of both, I feel its time we got the facts right. <br />The truth is Muse and Radiohead share similar, vocals, pessimism, and seriousness, oh.. and they are both rock bands. That means, they share the same fan base. Unfortunately, some of those very people with an eye for detail and appreciation for genuine music, who fell in love with Radiohead have now become blinded by their fixation. They are defensive, and feel some what threatened by Muse. <BR>And then, there is the other category of people, who just want to make a statement, \\"I was listening to music before you were born\\".  These people feel that listening to music for many years makes them bigger than the music itself. <BR>In the end, when you compare apples with oranges, you end up insulting both. Muse is everything Radiohead isn't and vice versa. Radiohead thrives to be subtle, layered music, matured and experienced whilst Muse is `in your face', grandiose, eager and energetic. Radiohead is poetry, Muse is a show. <BR>It is more appropriate to compare Muse with Queen. <br />I have always been a big fan of Radiohead but If I was forced to compare apples with oranges, I would have to admit, Muse have better vocals, guitar and piano. Anyone who rates this album below 3 stars is kidding themselves. I never thought I had to say this to a bunch of Radiohead fans but you need to listen to this album more than once to appreciate it. <br />Whilst rock bands continue to reminisce over the century that was, with bands like The shins (60's spin off), the strokes, darkness, white stripes (70's spin off) and Dandy Warhols (80's), Muse tries hard to push music into the 21st century. So I'd like to see what Matthew Cooke (Editorial reviewer on Amazon) has to say about these bands when apparently Muse is unoriginal. <br />With tracks, like Butterflies and Hurricances, Apocalypse please, Stockholme Syndrome, Hysteria, Thoughts of a Dying Atheist thereis no denying the brilliance and originality of Muse. <br />So, lets get it right, Absolution is an album worthy of being purchased and enjoyed.
B000001FKY|4.0|It's true that this album wasn't as &quot;metal&quot; as those before it, but that didn't stop it from being their best and most popular album. I like the early stuff too, right back to &quot;On Through The Night&quot;, but this is easily tops. Half of this disc is pretty much singles, hence six of these songs are on their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album. Included is &quot;Women&quot;, &quot;Animal&quot;, &quot;Love Bites&quot;, and the still often heard &quot;Pour Some Sugar On Me&quot;. One of my favorite tracks by far, which never seems to be mentioned by anyone, is &quot;Gods Of War&quot;. That song is awesome. Only a few albums from this genre are close to being this great, those are &quot;5150&quot;, &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot;, and &quot;Appetite For Destruction&quot;. All of them should make you &quot;Def&quot;.
0767836286|5.0|You come to a movie like this, if you are like me, thinking that it is another propaganda attempt by the left, trying to convince you that Christians with bibles are loonies that go around blowing up stuff. Thankfully Mark Pellington (Director) opted for something more realistic than that stereotypical portrayal.<br />There are no madmen, in the conventional sense, in this film, just ordinary people with grudges. People who have been hurt by the government and want to get back at it for what they perceive to be injustices. Pellington also reminds us that we are so quick to find scapegoats to blame because it gives us a sense of relief, a feeling that all is once again right with the world, and that acts of terrorism can only be carried out by `others' not by people like us. I don't want to give you the wrong impression however, because this is certainly not a didactic movie.<br />As to the movie itself, the plot is cleverly written and you definitely feel the tension and suspense building as the movie progresses. The characters are believable and frightening because of their normality. Joan Cusack was perfectly cast as the wife of the half-sane, half mad terrorist. I still can't get forget that sinister smile of hers.  Tim Robbin's character was credible, with the right balance of insanity and reason. He definitely wasn't the `typical villain.' As for Bridges, he was the one who made this whole movie work, without him the movie would have flopped.<br />I would highly recommend this movie, I don't give too many movies 5 stars but this one definitely deserved it. Arlington Road has a great cast, a great storyline, but best of all, it gets you to thinking about terrorism and what motivates terrorists. This is a very relevant movie, especially after the events of 9/11.
B000002L7J|4.0|I can't really say this is better or worse than any other &quot;Smiths&quot; album, because I find them all to be very good. So, I guess this would be your typical &quot;Smiths&quot; disc, with many excellent songs, and some not-quite-so excellent songs. Their most well known track &quot;How Soon Is Now?&quot; is on here, but I don't see that as a huge plus since I feel it's been overplayed through the years. &quot;Headmaster Ritual&quot; is a great track, and a good start to the album. &quot;Barbarism Begins At Home&quot; has some catchy bass, and I think &quot;That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore&quot; is probably the best song included here. Overall, I suppose I'd actually suggest &quot;Louder Than Bombs&quot;, &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot;, or even &quot;Strangeways, Here We Come&quot; before &quot;Meat Is Murder&quot;, but it's still a very good album, and goes great with a juicy burger.
B00006BTCA|5.0|On Interpol's debut attempt &quot;Turn On the Bright Lights&quot; you hear wonders. The first song, which is untitled, is a beautiful dreamy melody with a flowing bassline and and entrancing guitars and drums, and dreamy vocals. Almost makes you fall in love. Then it really takes off with good creative post-punk/rock music and ends beautifully. Meloncholic music has never been so damn catchy. The next album is coming out soon, and hopefully, it won't be a bomb. This band deserves more airplay on the snobby independent radio stations that play overrated (but worth mentioning) bands like the Strokes or Franz Ferdinand. This album is a masterpiece from start to finish. 5 stars without hesitation. I was stunned.
B0000TLA9G|4.0|Well, this is basically your typical &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album, nothing too suprising, just most of what should be here. A few of my personal faves are missing, but they were never hits anyway (Rocket Queen, Used To Love Her). Otherwise included is &quot;Welcome To The Jungle&quot;, &quot;Patience&quot;, &quot;November Rain&quot;, &quot;Don't Cry&quot;, and of course &quot;Sweet Child O' Mine&quot;. My only real complaint is the inclusion of FIVE covers, not that they're bad, but come on. Overall it's a good collection though, and will go great next to your &quot;Motley Crue&quot; and &quot;Def Leppard&quot; best of's.
B00000F2M4|5.0|Yes, this was an excellent show. Sadly, a couple of the takes from the movie we're were replaced on the album. For example, the movie version of &quot;I Burn for You&quot; outshines the album version. Nonetheless, very enjoyable and I'd step-up quickly to buy a DVD version.
B00005JKJA|2.0|you don't see a reviewer actually admit to being too dumb to understand a movie, but that's what happend in my case with this movie...<br />all i know is that there was a blue box, and all of a sudden no one had the right name anymore!  it made sense for about an hour and a half... but then i lost track of what was going on.  and i agree with the guy who said people re-watch this for the sex scenes.  they were pretty spicy.  but not spicy enough for me to bother with this confusing film again.  <br />it's along the lines of pi and donnie darko, but those movies actually made sense.  i'd recomend those instead.
1577311523|5.0|This is a wonderful book about being present more often in one's life, and not falling prey to worries about the future and regrets from the past to unleash the opportunity and power of 'now'.  Tolles uses a Q and A format to great advantage to his style, which is direct, powerful, and blunt.  His passion for the subject shines through in his brilliant focus, the crux of which is all there is is 'now' - but that 'now' contains in it everything, including forever.  Tolles approach is a logical and an almost scientific look at the notion of 'now' and consciousness to the 'now'.<br />Anyone can benefit from this book, and his style is passionate and stirring.  I just completed the book, I strongly suggest that you follow his &quot;stop signs&quot; and read the book with the idea of experiencing what you just read.
B0000TAZBK|5.0|I LOVE the music from lord of the rings, and I don't see why they don't sell the 3 cd's together anymore.  Besides, this one supposedly came with collector's items. Please, please, please re-release this so we don't have to buy three overpriced CDS!!!
6302130379|5.0|How many works of cinema are worth sitting through for 6 hours? Not many at all, but here you can't put it down. An unvarnished portrayal of the best and worst of humanity under harsh conditions. It makes you wonder where you would fit in, in this cinematic worldly epic. Most movie Westerns pale in comparison, especially the pop pseudo western bravado ones. Lonesome Dove finds the strength in humanity despite man's frail existence in nature. You don't have to like Westerns to love Lonesome Dove.
B00005K3O4|5.0|Here's a film that really delivers on the title.  They say Killer Klowns from Outer Space, and boy do they deliver the killer clowns.  Satanic clown cars, deadly shadow puppets, killer balloon animals ... these filmmakers put some real thought into what it means to be a killer clown from outer space.<br />This is one of those movies I can watch over and over again.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Let me start off by mentioning that Nu-metal is not my favorite kind of metal. Most bands that play Nu-metal, in my opinion, go on and on about how life sucks and use the F-word as if it is a strong poetic adjective. On the other hand, bands that aren't as commercialized or dumbed down, never seem to be appreciated for being artistic and actually using poetry (a.k.a. Shadows Fall, At The Gates, Opeth, Paradise Lost, Lacuna Coil, Nightwish, Tristania etc.). Regardless of the faults of this particular album, such as lack of musical variety and general shallowness of lyrical content, Slipknot are definitely an improved band from what they were, not to mention better than others in their genre. There is a ferocity to their music that is hard to describe, and for the first time since their self-titled album, I actually feel like they not only have a unique and catchy sound, but I can also connect to some of their lyrics. If you like Nu-metal at all, do not hesitate to purchase this album. If you absolutely hate any shallow content, you should check out the above bands, you might find something you haven't heard of. To end the review, I'd like to say I am a very critical reviewer, and I think Slipknot has hit the nail on the head this time.
0739313126|3.0|The Da Vinci Code starts out well, and it is a very fast read, with an interesting premise.<br /> I was however more and more annoyed with this book by the page. The plot takes turns that are utterly improbable, every chapter ends in an annoying cliffhanger and I often figured thing out long before the characters. Some of the story of the grail is also quite far from the truth - I didn't appreciate certain historical liberties.<br />Oh well. As a pageturning thriller it works quite well. I read it in under 24 hours - 3 sittings - which is fast for me although I'm an avid reader. If you don't have anything else to read and you need something to do, sure, but this isn't exactly quality literature.
B00005V0X5|4.0|I've always liked this album, and the remastering job is pretty good (though I still like the original as well).  The CD also has liner notes from Mustaine and Ellefson which are interesting and sometimes funny.  The downside is that to include &quot;These Boots&quot;, the band had to censor any lyrical differences from the original version.  It's actually kind of funny -- by the end, there's just a continuous beep to censor the altered lyrics.  A very good album.
B00001SIES|5.0|i consider this the best album by muse. every track is just so good... my favorite is probably 'Showbiz' or 'Cave' but really, theres not a one track that i would skip.
B000002HMH|2.0|Let me start out by saying that Metallica HAS EVERY RIGHT to play whatever kind of music they want to.  That being said, let me also say that I have every right not to like it.  Everyone is entitled to their own tastes and opinions, and I simply do not like this album.  It's not about them changing their style, it's about the end product, and I don't care much for this music.    On another note, music can bring back memories for me: I can hear a certain song and instantly recall a time and place in my past -- maybe you're the same way.  A lot of music brings back good memories for me, but this brings back some bad ones: the hot summer of 1996, living in a crummy apartment with my girlfriend (now wife), and the engine in my beautiful 1984 Firebird on its last legs.    Just one more thing: does anyone else find it ironic that a band that supposedly hates being labeled chose to name themselves METALlica?    If you're looking for some good Metallica, I recommend \\"Master Of Puppets\\" or \\"Ride The Lightning\\".
B00004T9UF|5.0|I loved this cd when i bought it and i still do. This aint nowhere near being one of the greatest rap albums, but its great. I am an eminem fan and this one is my favorite, despite the fact that he stole esham's rap style known as acid rap, but its all good. My favorite tracks are amityville, kill you, and criminal. If you like this album you should pick up better albums like the dayton family's F.B.I. or Bone Thugs-N-Harmony's E. 1999 Eternal before you get this.
B000002H2H|4.0|Many fans consider this to be Metallica's best.  Personally, I prefer &quot;Master Of Puppets&quot;, but this album is great as well.  &quot;For Whom The Bell Tolls&quot; and &quot;Fade To Black&quot; are standout tracks, and &quot;Escape&quot; could've been my theme song in my high school years.  Recommended.<br />I have to add though: does anyone else find it ironic that a band that supposedly hates being labeled chose to name themselves METALlica?
0446677450|1.0|Simply put, this is one of the worst books I have ever read. Kyosaki is superficial, repetitive and provides absolutely no useful information. The book is full of spelling mistakes, the diagrams in it are meaningless, and the writing is awful.<br />More importantly, the content itself is useless. I can only assume that Kyosaki hopes that by repeating the same meaningless stories over and over, they will somehow become true. <br />The best single word I can find to describe this book is: useless. Thank you Mr. Kyosaki for wasting my time and money.
