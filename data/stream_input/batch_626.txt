0743544676|5.0|This audio book is hysterical!  It doesn't matter if you're single OR married...  You USED to be single, so you'll be able to relate to the material.  And, you'll certainly be able to laugh at the stories and the way the authors entertain the 'readers.'  Personally, I found a lot of the info to be dead-on.  It was so funny and so true that I made one of my girlfriends listen to it, and I haven't been able to find the CDs since!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watched the movie Serenity, having bragged about it to everyone who would listen for 20 minutes i was informed there was a tv series i quickly bought it sight unseen. the best move i ever made. not only did i enjoy every minute of the series, but i immedietly became a \\"Browncoat\\" aka diehard Firefly fan.<br /><br />if you are unsure if this series is for you i highly reccomend you rent or borrow Serenity, watch it, if you give it at least a 6 out of 10 on your personal scale then invest in Firefly. the actors are the same, the dialog is the same, even the filming style is exactly the same, the series is like an 11 hour long prequel to Serenity (14 episodes, 40-45min each, 11 hours total)<br /><br />so watch the movie, if you like Serenity i urge you to get Firefly too

0385338082|3.0|I'm presently half way through Can You Keep a Secret, and I find myself struggling. It's not a difficult read, that's not what I'm saying. It does possess moments of humor, but I'm extremely annoyed with the writer's overuse of exclamation points. You might think this a petty and trivial critique, but when you have shouting dialogue playing out in your head as you read, it really starts to grate. It seems as though everything coming out of Emma's mouth must do so at great amplification (e.g. when asked by her cousin if Emma wants something to drink, Emma responds, \\"I'm fine!\\"). I've never been to Great Britain, nor have I had the pleasure of befriending someone hailing from Emma's hometown, so it could just be they're loud talkers. I don't know. What I do know is the copy editor should have taken the time to remove an exclamation point or 20.

B000FS9FCQ|5.0|great acting, beautiful cinematography, expert direction, and a gripping story make v for vendetta a classic.  it makes it's audience wonder what is in store for our future.  though it has a considerable amount of action, it is not an action movie, but much like the first matrix movie, you feel like it is.  natalie portman gives a great performance (its \\"closer\\" natalie portman, not \\"star wars\\" natalie portman), and hugo weaver is amazing.  he portrays so much emotion without ever showing you his face.  it's a wonderful directorial debut for james mcteigue (who was the assistant director for many movies such as the matrix trilogy), and the wachowski brothers know how to write a story.  its one of the best graphic novel adaptations i've seen.  all in all, its a great movie to own.

B00005JPAM|4.0|I just viewed the film \\"The Queen\\" today after traveling well over an hour to a theatre that is not afraid to show movies that actually have quality at heart and not just box-office results. I find it, first, a shame that most people will not see this movie, nor, probably, will never even hear of it. It is truely a movie that was made for two reasons, the first being to actually make a well-produced, directed, and acted film. The second, to bring a very real and timely issue to the screen in the hopes that people will see it for what it truely is.  <br />The film begins on the second day of May in 1997 shortly after Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) is elected as Prime Minister of Great Britain in a landslide victory. Queen Elizabeth (Helen Mirren), of course, is grudgingly forced more or less into offering him the job which obviously he accepts with the ideas of modernization and advancement of the country at heart. Skip ahead several months and move the scene to Paris on that fateful night of Princess Diana's car accident and death at the hands of the paparazzi. A several brief phone calls later and the entire English Royal family is awake and watching the news for further up date except the young William and Harry. <br />\\"How are the children, Charles\\" asks Mirren. <br />\\"I've decided not to wake them until we have further word on the matter\\" answers Prince Charles (Alex Jennings).  <br />And so begins the struggle that each family must go through when one of their own dies; or is Diana really one of their own? To the English populist, who instantly begin attacking the royal family for showing no sign of grief or remorse; while interiorly the queen orders continuously that \\"this is a private matter.\\" <br />Blair is caught in the crossfire as the newly elected Prime Minister and must decide if he should side with the people or his sovereign. Trying to easy the tension between the two Blair must face off with the queen with polite, respectful, graceful tact and show the people too that the government is doing something out of all the chaos of this unexpected and troubling event.  <br />\\"The Queen\\" is not a tabloid into the lives of the royal family; and only hints at the affair between Charles and Cammila, the supposed hatred Elizabeth and Philip have towards Diana, and inner workings of the public versus private funeral arrangements for Diana that may or may not have been stirred up out of malice, but rather shows the tame, more than likely, real life scenerio and roles played by every one who participated in them. The hatred and spite, if any, in refusing to have a public funeral was not so far as to have Elizabeth publically condemning Diana, but more so as a way to protect her grandchildren from the same fate that Diana, her whole life after being married into the royal family, spent in the presses eye. Overall the production shows the inner, much more humane, and understanding nature of the royal family than the one painted by the press.  <br />As for the film itself; production wise, it was a very nuanced approach to a subject that could have easily been reduced to an hour episode of 'Jerry Springer'. Not that I did not have my qualms about certain aspects of the movie, particularly the presences of the Queen Mother. Sylvia Syms' protrayal is nothing to be criticized, but rather the character in the screenplay always seems to be the comic relief. The 'old, senile, fat lady' who is always there for a good laugh, but really serving no other purpose than that was, unfortunatly, all she was good for in the film. But that minor detail, though so what annoying on film, was such a minor glich in an otherwise well made production. <br />As for performances; James Cromwell (yes, that James Cromwell) as Prince Philip makes an equally headstrong, subborned partner for Elizabeth and both play off each other well. Jennings as Charles casts the Prince in a rarely seen sympathetic light as a man who did have grief to deal with after his ex-wife's death. Applause definitely go out to Michael Sheen as Tony Blair, a family man at heart who, as an outsider, eventually sees the understandable reasonings behind Elizabeth and family's privacy in the midst of both scandal and sorrow.  <br />But the real star of the show is of course Helen Mirren, in a performance as powerful, haunting, and exact that one actually forgets this is an actress portrayal and completely believes this is in fact Elizabeth the Second, Queen of England. As the title says, Mirren is definitely the queen, and it certainly would be a royal sin if this actress did not finally win an Oscar that she has so desperately earned on many occasion with her portrayals on film. Helen Mirren, along with Meryl Streep, is the most talented and versatile actress working in entertainment today. <br />Without a doubt, 'The Queen', is easily one of the ten best films of the year; the director of 'Dangerous Liaisons' and 'Mrs. Henderson Presents' has created a stirring and important film that addresses the subjects of both the paparazzi and the private affairs of those constantly in the public eye and the portrayal they are given by the journalists and other media sources to the public as opposed to their actually workings in dealing with such issues that can have enough sorrowful impact upon them personally, let alone having the entire world watching and judging them as they grieve.

1579125549|5.0|This thing is awesome.  I bought it just to put my order over the free shipping limit, and it's huge!  Guess I should have guessed that of a book with 5334 chess problems.  Unlike many books of this sort, I have not yet found a single error after working many problems, which totally undermines the value of the books that harbor them.  It has a great variety of problems  for all levels and moods.  Sometimes I just want a quick-paced workout, going from one tactical problem to the next.  The mate in one and mate in two problems are wonderful for that.  When I feel particularly well-focused, I can attempt the games.  Should I ever actually complete all the puzzles in this book - which I seriously doubt - by that time I'm sure I can start over and they'll all be perfectly fresh again.  A book of truly inexhaustible value.
B00006LLNU|5.0|This work from Sigur Ros, is an extraordinary blend of imagery and melancholic poetry. I am amazed at the endeless possibilities of using one single word to build up an almost 7 minutes song. This is a prayer, a religious ritual in which repetition enables the listener into a sort of trance. There comes a time in which words become secondary and there remains only the essence, the purity of the significance, of the precious content that dwells inside the pursuit of beauty. Just wonderful.
0393035158|5.0|Harris identifies religion as the main sponsor of irrationality in our culture and on that basis, rejects it as responsible for the fruits of irrationality. I can't argue with that position, but I'd like to remind readers that the promoters of New Age, vegetarianism, astrology, alternative medicine, entertainment, and many self-help ideas are also guilty of irrationality and are, in my mind, more insidious because they appeal to people who have rejected mainstream religion.  <br /> <br />The real enemy is the lazy mind, one which will adopt uncritically any slogan, cliche, or ideology because it requires less thought than science and mathematics. Every academic year, students choose a career based on how little mathematics they must learn to enter. These same students graduate in four or more years with diplomas which cover up their complete ignorance of one of the main tools of rational thought. <br /> <br />Irrationality is the real enemy and religion is its standard bearer. <br /> <br />

B000GRUS22|5.0|As an owner of all of Enigma's albums I have seen Michael Cretu's style change over the past 2 albums, so my purchase of \\"A Posteriori\\" I expected to see something new from him. I think part of Enigma is the \\"enigmatic\\" experience he continues to deliver. For me, this album did take a couple listens to feel the flow and direction Cretu took with this as well as playing it on our surround sound (took advice from other reviewers).  <br /> <br />I am a fan of ambient and progressive trance music so I immediately connected with this album. The first 3 tracks are somewhat of a different style for Enigma and more upbeat, but very catchy. The flow from upbeat to \\"chill\\" is well masked as the tracks progress. The CD is much more instrumental, but the underlying melodies and layered sounds generated deliver a unique sound. Cretu adds some vocals to stick to the older style of Enigma, but I miss the women's vocals.  <br /> <br />Overall, this is probably my 2nd or 3rd favorite Enigma album behind Le Roi Est Mort and a toss up between Voyageur. Give it a listen and it will grow on you! Although the \\"If it ain't broken, don't fix it\\" phrase has labeled this album as a disappointment, appreciate Cretu's latest work as a representation of the word Enigma: \\"a mysterious, puzzling and unexplainable event\\" and you won't be let down!

B0002OERI0|5.0|Punk has long had two major but contradictory elements.  At first punk represented the disaffected, angry, stoner-slacker, working class.  This kind of punk was politically disengaged, other than a general \\"What are we  rebelling against? What have you got?\\" attitude.  Most of these punk rockers weren't great musicians or songwriters; they got by on bile.  The Ramones and the Sex Pistols were the archetypes.  People forget that the Sex Pistols hardly even qualified as musicians; they were an assembled band chosen by a producer, like a darkside version of the Monkees.  Before long, though, punk found a serious political voice in The Clash, whose \\"London Calling\\" is still the greatest punk album ever made.  In the U.S. this side of punk found its voice in bands like the Dead Kennedys, Mission of Burma, X, and Bad Religion. These bands were still angry, but they were more overtly political, and gradually their musicianship got much better.    In this context, Green Day is an interesting case.  Their early stuff had the slacker-stoner attitude, but their musicianship was better -- well, at least the rhythm section, since Billie Joe was not much of a guitarist.  Most punk bands of that type self-destruct, but for whatever reason Green Day did not.  As the members aged, they naturally became more thoughtful and political, and their music became more ambitious and varied.  The concept album \\"American Idiot\\" is the result.    A punk concept album might seem a contradiction in terms.  Classic rock era concept albums (whether successful, like \\"Sgt. Pepper's,\\" \\"Tommy,\\" \\"Quadrophenia,\\" \\"Darkside of the Moon,\\" \\"The Wall,\\" or complete garbage like \\"Paradise Theater\\") were part of what punk rebelled against.  Punk is all about three-minute bursts of catharsis, not ambitious, long-form, potentially pretentious concepts.  But \\"American Idiot\\" avoids the bloat of many concept albums.    Even so \\"American Idiot\\" must be considered as a whole.  Listen to the whole cd without watching the display and you will find it impossible to guess where all the individual tracks begin and end.  A single track will have several distinct sections with changes of melody, rhythm, and even instrumentation (which is why the cd never feels bloated), whereas a later track will repeat the motif of an earlier one.  Meanwhile, taking individual songs out-of-context distorts them.  For example, \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" is filled with trite lines, clichés really.  But the song is written in the voice of a character.  Green Day is giving us the thoughts of someone who only knows how to express himself in these worn-out phrases.  The song works simultaneously as an expression of youthful angst (it reminds me of Del Shannon's \\"Runaway\\" in that sense) and as a parody of the limited ways young people have of expressing it.  On that level, it is truly moving -- but on its own, on the radio, it's more than a little silly.      If you read several pages of reviews here, you will see certain criticisms of \\"American Idiot\\" repeated ad nauseam.  Those people who have attacked \\"American Idiot\\" for using \\"three chords\\" make two mistakes.  1) Most punk (and for that matter most popular music of all kinds) relies upon relatively basic chord structures, and basic rhythms (usually 4/4) as well;  2) \\"American Idiot\\" actually has more complex songwriting and arrangements than you will usually hear in popular music.  Those who have attacked it for being too political either dislike Green Day's politics (fine, but that doesn't make a valid criticism of the cd) or prefer Ramones/Sex Pistols-style punk.  But mere angry posing gets old pretty fast, and if a band survives as a creative entity it will naturally become more thoughtful as its members get older, have kids, and start paying more attention to the world and less attention to their own petty frustations.  If you don't like it, you can listen to their earlier stuff or keep finding new bands made up of 18 year-olds without a thoughtin their pretty snarling heads, singing about being stoned and not having girlfriends.  That's not where these guys are in their lives now.  If you don't like it, register your complaints with whoever decided that people can't stay seventeen forever.  You can't keep singing \\"I'm not growing up / I'm just burning out\\" when you are closer to forty than twenty.    Overall, \\"American Idiot\\" is a superb work.  It's musically varied but makes a cohesive whole -- one of those cds you simply put into your player and push \\"play\\" instead of selecting tracks.  It's angry and political but with an actual narrative, so that the politics are part of a story instead of being punk protest music.  (In contrast, I love Bad Religion, but they can rightly be called didactic.)  If you had asked me a dozen years ago if Green Day would still be here and be interesting, I'd have bet against it.  I would have been wrong.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|Mr. Loaf has released eight studio albums, not counting this one, which will surprise those who thought there had been only two - Bat Out Of Hell I and II. So completely has the Bat series dominated the big man's career, it's hard to name anything else he has done - a cameo as a bus driver in the Spice Girls film comes to mind. - those other six albums (including the most recent, Couldn't Have Said it Better in 2002, and Welcome to the Neighbourhood in 1995) are stubbornly unmemorable. It's not the fault of the albums themselves, but of the looming Bat shadow, which effectively cancels out everything else.<br /><br />Meat claims that III will be the last of the Bats, so, fittingly, it's the most ludicrous of all. Following a copyright lawsuit, this is the first album on which writer/producer Jim Steinman has played no active part (he has, however, contributed seven songs, including It's All Coming Back to Me Now, a 1996 hit for Celine Dion). Meat fills the void in two ways: by recruiting the most bombastic sidemen available (including Queens's Brian May,former Marilyn Manson guitarist John 5 and Motley Crue's Nikki Sixx). For what it's worth, there's a loose narrative thread (the \\"monster\\" - war, famine, pestilence - is on the loose, so you might as well stay at home with a Meat Loaf album), the record's main purpose, which is to indulge Meat's love of the gothic. He pours on the melodrama from the start, and if \\"melodramatic\\" could just as well describe the first two Bat albums.<br /><br />Meat is 58, and as he blasts out the bell-ringing, choir-filled arias entitled Blind as a Bat and Bad for Good (the latter featuring a hell-for-leather Brian May).<br /><br />Still everything you could hope for in a Bat Album.

B000AMWIVM|2.0|Acting: forget it. Story: Ludacrous. However the production design (sets, the puppet, killer mechanisms) and the cinematography are worth mentioning - although I can tell you now that the stylish overall look of this film will seem awfully dated in a dozen of years.  <br />I'm giving this film 2 stars: one for the efforts of the production design team, the other one is to be shared by the marketing heads of the studio, the editor who cut one hell of a good trailer together and the graphic designer(s) who are responsible for the layouts of all promo material.

B000002HRE|2.0|Review no. 618. Somewhat disappointing follow-up to their '96 'Load' CD, which was one of their better works ever, I thought. I remember SO many fans commenting how let down they were when this disc first came out. It's not so terrible, it's just nothing to get all tanked up about. Some of the tracks here, I thought were okay, are &#34;The Memory Remains&#34; (love the video where Marianne Faithfull makes an appearance-now THAT'S semi-original), &#34;The Unforgiven II&#34;, the melodic &#34;Where The Wild Things Are&#34; and &#34;Bad Seed&#34;. Not the worst metal release I've ever heard, by any means. Take my advise, buy a used copy of this title.

B00005JPBP|5.0|Before I begin the proper review of the movie itself a quick word about the director Christopher Nolan. Nolan is quickly becoming one of the greatest directors of our time. All his works have been quite diverse and exceptional.  MEMENTO and BATMAN BEGINS are two of my all time favorite movies and INSOMNIA was a pretty decent thriller.    When THE PRESTIGE was announced I immediately thought \\"this has to be the best movie to come out in a long time!\\" especially since I've been a huge fan of Nolan and Bale's previous works. Simply put, both of them are among some of the most talented people in the movie business right now!    THE PRESTIGE is based on a novel by Christopher Priest. Personally, I've never read the book but after watching the movie I am looking forward to reading the book, just like I got into Chuck Palahniuk's writing after watching FIGHT CLUB.    Set in the 18th century, the plot revolves around two rival stage magicians Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman).    The intense rivalry and it's effect on the two men's lives and those they love is the main focus of the story. There are enough twists and turns to keep you guessing till the end. I don't want to give more details about the story because it's best if you watch this movie with very little information. And I personally loved how everything was tied up in the end. This is one of those movies where you will be compelled to watch again after it's over! That's how Nolan makes his movies, you want to watch them again... and again!    The direction is wonderful. If you loved BATMAN BEGINS, THE PRESTIGE is a treat to watch. The editing is superb. Some shots won't make any sense in the beginning but become more and more sense as the film progresses. This is a film that's meant to be watched carefully... picking up clues the director leaves for you. The production values are amazing, the sets are gorgeous and the entire look of the film is a joy to watch. Simply, this is one of the best looking films you'll see this year!    Coming to the cast, how can you ever go wrong with a cast the includes Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johanssen, Piper Perabo, Andy \\"Gollum\\" Serkis and David Bowie as Nikola Tesla? Christian Bale is once again awesome! He has a psycho vibe going on throughout the film. You never know when the guy would go all psycho and do something really crazy! We all know how well he does these type of characters, be it AMERICAN PSYCHO, THE MACHINIST or the current HARSH TIMES or even BATMAN BEGINS, Bale nails  it! Hugh Jackman also gives a decent performance, in fact his character was the most complex and he fit the part perfectly. Another success for him this year! The ladies do a decent job even though they all have quite brief screen times. Michael Caine is great, as always and David Bowie makes this movie extra cool as the enigmatic scientist Nikola Tesla.    So my review has been extra positive so far, so are there any flaws in this film? If you ask me... NO! It's one of the best films to come out in a long time! Great direction, an interesting and complex plot and an amazing cast. What else do you want in a movie?    I personally can't wait for THE DARK KNIGHT to watch Nolan and Bale back in action in 2008!
0684824906|4.0|I am not expert in either Civil War history or Abraham Lincoln but was attracted to this multi-headed biography by the notion of the complexity of personalities Lincoln had to manage in order to draw together an effective Cabinet.  Obtaining this end, effective government, was made infinitely more challenging by the fact several of these talented individuals had been pipped at the post by Lincoln whose drive and guile they underestimated in the race for the Republican Presidential nomination.    Equally, the challenge Kearns Goodwin set herself in attempting the many-faceted biography of several multi-faceted men should not be underestimated.  Her acheivement in producing a work of this calibre is of the highest order.  Kearns-Goodwin's capacity to layout and then integrate the background and personality of Lincoln and each of his \\"rivals\\" constantly surprised and delighted me both in terms of her insight into each person's strengths and foibles and her humanity in uncovering them.  The tensions surrounding day to day government in wartime such as Cabinet meetings, raising funds, managing logistics and the frustrations and tragedies war are keenly described.    On a more day to day level I was profoundly moved by her capacity to convey the personal horror felt by Lincoln and his wife at the death of their son and the sometime spiteful treatment Washington society doled out to Mrs Lincoln perhaps as a surrogate for direct assault on the lowly backgound of the President himself.    As an Australian, I feel I am both a broader human being and, in a way, enobled through more deeply understanding Lincoln, his government, and this important period of American history.
0446528056|5.0|First and foremost, I want to mention that this is the best Nicholas Sparks novel to date. YOu care about the two main characters, John and Savannah, but you also care about the surroundings of the two characters.<br /><br />The reader comes to love and understand John's dad, doomed, yet the reader feels it will happen, but when it does, you cry anyway.<br /><br />It is the novel by Sparks with the most twists in it, and the ending is happy, just not like the rest of his novels.<br /><br />It is brilliantly written, and very heart-tugging. It is my favorite Sparks novel. I loved it, and the ending is amazing, yet very lovely.

The vocal harmonies and melodies were gorgeous and the songs themselves still retained an ageless beauty whose substance is not bound to the era from which it was created but remains timeless and pertinent to the soul and emotions of any era, much like a classical piece of music. I am certainly glad I finally followed thru and updated my music collection with this. Truly an ageless all-star for anyone who loves good music. B.Auger

Nicholson: Well, I suppose I would have to kill myself.\\"  The chaos and mangled morality of war is perfectly shown, especially in the final scene.  \\" Madness!\\"  This is a great movie.
0380730405|5.0|It's all about Rebecca. She appears constantly in the mind of the main character telling the story, whose name you never learn, further burying her in the presence of Rebecca. The protagonist is a young woman who quite suddenly marries a man older than herself who was married once before. Maxim de Winter's previous wife, the last Mrs. de Winter, was Rebecca.<br /><br />Our young bride goes with Maxim to his great home, Manderly, which she loves, but it can not hide her from Rebecca's overwhelming presence. To her it seems Maxim is always thinking about Rebecca, whom everyone loved, who died in a boating accident just a year before. She feels herself being constantly compared to Rebecca; this is not what Rebecca would have done, Rebecca must have done it like this, Rebecca was taller, Rebecca was a social butterfly, Rebecca was very beautiful, Rebecca Rebecca Rebecca. She is 'nothing like Rebecca.'<br /><br />Having not been brought up in this type of life, she must get used to the grandness of Manderly. The servants, like one Mrs. Danvers who absolutely adored Rebecca; the people, who she must contact and talk to and who are constantly pressing her to hold the great dress ball of Manderly that Rebecca used to run; and the ocean, which stands as a constant reminder of Rebecca's tragic death, with its little boat-house that brings painful memories to Maxim.<br /><br />Although people must compare her to Rebecca, the poor girl makes it worse by exercising her very vivid imagination; putting words where none were said, and constantly imagining things that don't happen. She does not fit into this life, and Maxim isn't making it any easier. You feel very, very sad for her, as it seems it's quite impossible for her to be really happy.<br /><br />The quiet, depressing wave takes a turn when she makes up her mind to hold the dress ball. A cruel joke is played on her, and it seems she's at a worse position than before, but then something happens in the bay. Something is found, something to do with Rebecca, and you don't know what is going to happen to our little protagonist who may have her first chance at happiness.<br /><br />A very emotional and intriguing story, it goes rather calmly at first, then gives you a grand twist to end in a flourish. As you learn more and more about Rebecca, you start to wonder; about the presumptions the new bride makes about her, and the real character of Rebecca., something to do with Rebecca, and you don't know what is going to happen to our little protagonist who may have her first chance at happiness.<br /><br />A very emotional and intriguing story, it goes rather calmly at first, then gives you a grand twist to end in a flourish. As you learn more and more about Rebecca, you start to wonder; about the presumptions the new bride makes about her, and the real character of Rebecca.
0767020308|4.0|I'd actually give it 3.5, but rounded up.  Kate Beckingsdale does a pretty good job of portraying Emma, but I like Gwyneth Paltrow better.  Mark Strong is too angry as Mr. Knightley and is yelling all of the time.  I found nothing in Jane Austen's book to support this characterization.  I do like Harriet Smith in this version.  Her naivete is more believable than Toni Collette's. <br /> <br />If you are a great Jane Austen fan, go ahead and buy it.  You'll need all of the Emma productions for your collection!!
B000002KOQ|5.0|I bought this album on LP when it first came out and have always liked it. This was Joni's third album and I enjoy it more than any others.  Never heard her first two albums until just recently and they didn't strike me as anything that special.  The next two albums (4th & 5th), Blue and For the Roses were fine albums, but had no particularly memorable songs, as this album has. In the 6th album (Court & Spark), the sound is different; some people like it the best, but it didn't do much for me.  Ladies of the Canyon is still the best sounding Joni Mitchell, in my opinion.  Big Yellow Taxi is my favorite, but all the songs are nice sounding.  Joni has an interesting delivery and sometimes it seems that she is trying to sing a rambling poem that in some cases should not have been made into a song.  A little Joni goes a long way and her delivery tends to make some of her songs sound a lot a alike.  In spite of all that and in spite of the fact that she isn't my favorite singer, she is still very interesting and this album is a strong 5-star album.  A great starter album for someone who has never heard Mitchell.
B0002W4SWC|5.0|This modern adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice just makes you smile.  While Bridget lacks Elizabeth Bennet's confidence, she makes up for it with her wit.  Renee Zellweger is great in the leading role and Colin Firth again plays the proud Mr. Darcy to perfection.

B000002WAD|4.0|\\"In the '80s and '90s, England's dance-music team Stock, Aitken & Waterman was often accused of being too slick for its own good, and favoring style over substance. But the producers/songwriters (also known for their work with Dead or Alive and Samantha Fox) should definitely be proud of their work on fellow Briton Rick Astley's often captivating debut album, Whenever You Need Somebody. While the high-tech production is very '80s, Astley's soul/pop/dance music approach is very much a production of the '70s -- sort of the Average White Band meets Philly soul/disco meets Tom Jones. The best dance music works both on and off the dance floor, and this certainly holds true on such slick yet gritty fare as 'Together Forever,' 'Never Gonna Give You Up,' and 'Don't Say Goodbye.' There are a few weak moments -- the lackluster 'No More Looking for Love' being a glaring example -- but overall, this CD proved Astley to be a welcome addition to the British R&B scene. ~ Alex Henderson, All Music Guide\\" [refers to 1987 Album Release Date,  RCA Label]
B000IOM0YM|3.0|I have seen most of this before it was released and I will say the 5.1 mix is weak! The transfers could have been better on some but I know it comes down to the original sources and that's where you're slave to what you have to work with.<br /><br />They are many more concerts that I have seen before not included on this disc set...why did KISS picked these shows?<br /><br />I wish there were more commentary to this...that's what KISS fans want to know...what were you thinking and what was happening to them right then. what was available was cool...alot of it is printed in the booklet insert.<br /><br />How about some commentaries from Peter & Ace?<br /><br />Having seen KISS many times and worked for a venue that hosted a KISS concert, I must say that the excitement was not even close to what they could have offered to KISS fans.<br /><br />but this disc set will be in my collection... because KISS was all that!

It's delightful, actually. Sandler is subtle as the cook. Tea Leoni is great as the poster girl for High Strung Wife in SUV. And the kids are awesome.
0743298020|1.0|This book is a mess.  Dumb plot, one dimensional characters-each one more aggrevating than the next-overwritten and pretensious prose.  I'm old enough to remember the REAL gothic novels-this ain't one of them. And did we EVER find out what happened to Hester? Waste of time and a trick ending. Bah humbug!
B00005JO1R|3.0|This particular version, the \\"Collector's\\" edition, is not worth the extra money.  I was hoping for extras that had actual footage of Johnny and June, but what the extras all appear to be is just additional promo material for the movie itself.  I would have loved to see even stills of the concert at Folsom, rather than them talking about \\"John\\" and showing footage of Joaquin.  Not that he didn't give a masterful performance, it just wasn't what I expected or thought I was getting.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This show put on by the Eagles in 2005 is impressive. Every song sounds crystal clear and played to perfection.  The picture of this dvd is unbelievable.  It almost looks like your watching the show HD style. The Eagles perform their hits, along with hits by Joe Walsh and Don Henley.  Joe Walsh...in my opinion steals the show. His enthusiasm is remarkable, and really shows you how much fun these guys are still having.  A MUST BUY...and I hope they go on a Farewell Tour II. Also, this dvd has impressive interviews with the band.  BUY IT!!
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|Where the 2002 debut album showed great promise, this latest release from 30 Seconds to Mars fulfills it while meeting/exceeding/casting away all other expectations.  <br /> <br />Jared Leto is an actor whose work I've long respected and admired and he's proven his brilliance in music as well, playing in the arenas of songwriting and production. This time around, he has a dynamic team in his brother Shannon and new members Matt Wachter and Tomo Milicevic. The result is a universally interpretive, individually vulnerable, and altogether unique audible experience...a journey through the human psyche in life, love, death, and relevance.  <br /> <br />Loosely translated, this was an awesome album! I highly recommend anyone with an open mind and a love for music to pick this up and expect to see much more from this intrepid group of musicians. <br />
B000FL7CAK|4.0|Without the focus of solving Lily Kane's murder, the show if anything gets more interesting.  The problem may be that Veronica herself is too interesting:  what eighteen-year-old really talks like this?  She sounds like an intelligent and very witty thirty-five year old steeped in the pop culture references of that generation, even with the occasional allusion to, say, Radiohead.  And really:  who is this smart?  Not that I'm complaining.  I was riveted to the screen till I ran out of discs.
0743277708|5.0|Article on Today show about Fiver, the rabbit. A man had read the book as a boy and was influenced by the story to start Fiver Camps and a Fiver Foundation. It takes young people 7 or 8 in the summer and; not only works with them in the summer, but the counselors and others follow these young people for 10 years and they have finished school and choose a path to follow. There is a liason with the home, school, young person in all aspects of growth. All because of a wonderful story \\"Watership Down\\" written years ago.
0451526384|4.0|Even though Persuasion is one of Jane Austen's lesser known novels it is very well written and also a very good story. The story is centered around the romance of Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth. They had fallen in love eight years before the novel takes place, but Anne broken off their engagment after Lady Russell persuaded her that he was not a suitable match. They end up seeing each other again after Anne's family runs into money problems and Anne and Wentworth realize that their feeling for each other are renewed. Problems from their past and also their families hurt their chance of a fresh start. <br />I thought this novel was very interesting and another one of Jane Austen's great novels.
B000244FDW|1.0|I rented this edition of P&P over the weekend to watch with a fellow Austen fanatic, and we both hated it. We have seen nearly every version of this classic tale, and this one is at the very bottom. The actors are horrible, especially Mr. Darcy, who has the same face and shows the exact same emotion throughout the whole movie until the very end. There is very little chemistry between him and Elizabeth, so it made it harder to believe the ending, unlike in other editions. It is extremely slow-moving, edited very poorly, and very little art or music direction. It was actually very painful to watch the whole 4 hours, and I would never recommend this version to anyone. The A&E/BBC version with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth still reign supreme to me. Despite some problems, it is the most believable, most romantic, most beautifully done production of Pride and Prejudice.
B000000H6D|5.0|The truth is that, it's next to impossible to do justice to the phenomenon that is Type O Negative and in particular to this album which was my introduction to them. As a lowly metal buyer in a record shop, my musical life changed the day a promo copy of Bloody Kisses came from the record company. This album simply knocked my socks off and started a love affair with this incredible bands music that has now lasted 13 years. I remember repeatedly breaking my shops policy by telling potential customers to \\"....buy it, listen to it and if you don't like it bring it back and I'll give you your money back\\" I never did get a single copy returned, but I do remember getting phone calls from them hours later saying how they haven't stopped listening to it and how much they love it. So if you like honest, epic and hauntingly beautiful music with a wonderful sense of dark humour. then you won't be disappointed. Be prepared to buy everything else they have released cos you will....
B000CNFC76|5.0|A great, feel good movie.  Didn't think twice about buying it to add to my collection.
0618680004|5.0|I trully consider that this book should be read by anyone who is in search of the truth and is not affraid to find it. I hope that people open up and give this book a chance. As for those who have written bad reviews about it, obviously,they  either didn't actually read it, or were biased and closed-minded.  These people, and those who think alike, should read more about the facts of evolution and less about ancient mythology that doesn't really explain anything and teaches people to be content with supernatural non-sense. <br /> <br />San Jose, Costa Rica
B00000JPH6|3.0|This is definitely one of those films that define a moment in puppet film history. They were able to carry off an entire movie entirely cast by puppets -- and pretty well.  This is the link between Muppets to, say, Farscape.  But the story does take itself a bit too seriously.
006085880X|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book, it was interesting and well written.  However, I just did not believe the characters.  Their reactions and interactions with one another just were not realistic.
B0002JJBZY|5.0|If you're thinking of buying this, you probably are already a Trek fan and don't need a review of content, so context then:  The episodes are all there (some out of order) in high quality.  The menus are a bit clunky, but they're cute.  The packaging is a horrendous waste of plastic, but again, it's cute.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|The music is great as is the story.  It is as interesting as it was when it was first released. A good movie to have in one's collection.
B00003CX95|5.0|Braveheart is easily one of the greatest movies ever. It has the perfect amount of everything in it (romance, action, comedy, drama, etc) and has a great storyline, not to mention that its based on a true story. I recommend that everyone watch this film at least twice.
0425200450|5.0|I absolutely adored this book. I have never really read many mysteries but after reading Murder on the Orient Express I have decided to start reading more. This novel is so great for many reasons. First off, the murder occurs fairly early in the book so you are not bored by tedious non-important facts. I also like this book because it lays out all the characters at the beginning, so you can flip to the front if you get confused. This murder is so full of twists and turns you never know what is going to happen. This mystery keeps you guessing until the end. When the murderer is finally shown you are shocked and bewildered. I think that Agatha Christie did a fantastic job of writing a great mystery. She developed all of the characters so that the reader was acquainted which each of them .She made it so the reader truly cared about figuring out who killed the horrible murder victim.
079075116X|5.0|\\"Firefox\\" is one of my all-time favorite adventure movies.  It is an adaptation of Craig T. Thomas' novel by the same name.  The novel has a brief introduction, and divides the story into two equal parts.  The movie expands the intro into a third part, almost equal in length to the other two.  It may seem slow, but I found it helped establish the story.<br /><br />This is a cold-war era story, where the heroes are Americans and the villains are the Russian Government.  I always enjoy it when we are not the bad guys.  But in this story, not all the Russians are evil.  In fact, in a dogfight sequence you get the impression it is a fight to the death, not between two enemies, but between two people who respect each other, yet one is commanded to kill the other, and the other needs to kill or be killed.<br /><br />A movie to contrast this with was Blue Thunder, directed by Ralph Bedlam, and released the following year.  There are a lot of similarities between the two.  The two main differences:  1) Firefox is more suitable for older children, having a 1982 PG rating, and probably been PG-13 due solely to violence today, while Blue Thunder is R-rated, and has nudity, profanity, and innuendo that was not necessary to the story, and 2) in Blue Thunder, it is our government that is the bad guy.
0321146530|4.0|This is a short, detailed, easy-to-follow introduction to TDD. Nothing on the market is a better first book on the subject. This book will be only your first step on a long journey; you'll probably have to read more, or take some course(s), or work with an experienced TDD practitioner, to apply TDD to read world projects.<br /><br />But there's a zeroth step Kent Beck could have given a lot more help with. You can't use TDD on a medium-to-large sized project without getting approval from the project's leaders. They might well ask, \\"Exactly what is the primary benefit from using TDD?\\" Does it directly increase project velocity (i.e., get the software out the door faster)? Does it improve the quality of software developed with it? This book doesn't answer that question. (It tells you how much TDD supports refactoring, but that leads back to the same question.)<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I think TDD is very helpful. I just couldn't convince management of that, based on this book.<br /><br />Read this, but look elsewhere for justification on using TDD.
B000BBOUU4|1.0|I loved the original movie, and I love Johnny Depp so I thought this movie would be awesome.Wrong wrong wrong!! First of all, the child actors were horrible, well the Charlie and Mike characters were ok, but the two girl actors were the worst I've seen in a long time. And what did they do to Johnny Depp? He was so creepy and weird. I took my nine year old to see it in the theater, and even she almost fell asleep. If you really want a treat watch the original with Gene Wilder.

B000687M48|5.0|From A long time I have been a big Fan of Evanescence <br />After awhile I got their cd's and I came across this item. <br />So I bought it and was instantlly satisfied. <br />In the begining you can watch the concert live in Paris <br />And Amy's vocaly are hauntingly beautiful, and they leave you craving for more. She never ceases to amaze me with her talent on the piano and her vocals. After watching the concert, I watched the music videos, and then the best part... behind the scenes where you get to see Amy and her band who are actually pretty normal. They have fun and party and do stupid things like the rest of us. But of course on the side they have one of the best bands ever. <br />I would reccomend this product to anyone who loves Evanescence and wants to know more about them. This definetly gives the inside scoop! <br />I was lucky enough to actually go and see them live for their new album and is just as amazing. <br />Evanescence rocks. Amy rocks.

0743564170|5.0|I like to \\"read\\" while I drive.... and boy did I take some long drives while enjoying this incredible novel.  I bought it on a whim and it drew me in at the first sentence.  Half way through it, I ordered the hard back for my library... I was so impressed!  I couldn't wait to get up in the morning to go out for another read!  I needed to hear more secrets that would unfold.... this was my kind of ghost story... a true mystery! <br />How could this really be a first time novel for Diane Setterfield?  It is written with such brilliance.  I can't wait for her next book.  I highly recommend the Thirteenth Tale in either paper or on audio.... the voices on audio are fabulous!!!   JMHO   //(*_*)\\
B000H305U0|5.0|I debated on buying this album initially.  Finally, after a couple album purchases that felt like same-old-same-old, I decided to give FutureSex/LoveSounds a try.  I am glad I did.  This album isn't for the music snobs of the world.  To most of that type, anything that smacks of being fun or funky just has to be crap, right?  Wrong.  While there is certainly more than plenty of fluff in today's poppy R&B-type music, that shouldn't take away from the great albums that do exist alongside all that pop candy.  And Timberlake's album is one of those great albums.  I have quickly come to love this album.  It's a fun funky disc that has the quality to ensure you won't tire of it in a week's time.  If you like this type of music, or namely his first single \\"SexyBack\\", you'll like this album.  I definitely recommend it for anyone looking for something a bit more refreshing and fun.
B000FP2OPY|2.0|Nothing wrong with the concept of some kick-butt metaphysicians working the subtle realms against negatives, but there is no maturity in the content. Never do they actually do any form of spiritual practice to prepare themselves for such supernatural encounters, never do they gain actual wisdom, and never is there any indication that the supernatural could actually be positve, which is so in my experience. The teenage heroes cruise around lookin' for always-evil ghosties, etc. to blast with shotguns. It could be a fascinating show, but falls apart under nonsense dialogue, beer and bullets. I'm sad to see this kind of garbage passed off as part of the \\"supernatural\\", ie always something negative. Anything these boys don't understand goes down, or away, in a hail of bullets, even though the entity in question may be non-physical or at least other than physical. I forced myself through half a dozen episodes and then pitched it. If you're 13, and liked the recent film Brothers Grimm, this is for you. CBS' Medium may be milktoast, but it's far more accurate.
B00005JKG9|2.0|It is unusual that I disagree with so many great critics praising a movie where there is so much talent. This movie tries to deal with alot and does alot of it well BUT as a viewer, I am hugely distracted by Mamet's dialogue. No, I do not agree that people in the real business world talk like this! Real people do not mindlessly echo over and over and over the same phrases that they hear each other speaking. If I did that in my working environment my coworkers would think there was something wrong with me. Real conversation does not run in that kind of patter. After listening to the characters for ninety minutes, I finally came to the conclusion that many of the characters sounded alike and the one connection point was Mamet. Real people talk differently from each other. They use different and distinct speech patterns and phrases and slang. I've had this problem with Mamet before and I can't believe nobody has ever noticed this before - and I would doubt that I am the first. I wouldn't be surprised if - somewhere - some actor in some Mamet production has pondered this before. Come on! Good dialogue is like good acting: if it's really good, you don't notice it until the show's over.

B00000DCHD|5.0|As the follow up to Joel's breakthrough The Stranger, this album suffered in comparison to the hit-packed Stranger. However, with 27 years of perspective, it is time to acknowledge the true genius of this album. <br /> <br />As always, Joel tries to be all things to all people. There are the obligatory top 10 hits (\\"Big Shot,\\" \\"Honesty,\\" \\"My Life.\\") There are some smooth jazz riffs (\\"Zanzibar,\\" \\"Stiletto,\\" \\"52nd Street.\\") There's even a little Latin music (\\"Rosalinda's Eyes.\\") The real hidden gem here, though, is Joel's unexpected Righteous Brothers tribute \\"Until The Night.\\" <br /> <br />All in all, this deserves a worthy spot on any \\"Desert Island Disc List.\\"

No pseudo scientific techno jibberish? A sci fi series with real people, real skulduggery and real dirt?<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I love Trek too, but sometimes the socialist utopianism becomes irritating, its just too . . .  shiny. Space as gritty frontier is nothing new to sci fi, nor is the libertarian zeitgeist highlighted by this series; however, the juxtaposition of well ordered civilization (where one yearns to breathe free) and chaotic freedom (where one yearns for a doctor) is presented in a fun, ironic and not too preachy mix.<br /><br />I'd heard good things about this show so I bought the DVDs on a whim, boy what a treat!

I can't believe they canceled it -- get a rope.<br /><br />Looking for parallel universes? Time travel conundrums? Puzzles that demand higher order thinking? Keep looking, this series doesn't even pretend to humor the \\"calculus = baby math\\" set (though I suspect more than a few Browncoats are members of Mensa.) Want Plato or a long analysis of The Grundrisse? Not a chance. You won't find much diplomacy here; however, you will love the Alexander vs. Gordian Knot approach to the moral quandries foisted upon the crew. You will appreciate this show all the more if you can give a nod to Rousseau, and can imagine being in a more natural state in a plastic rathole on an airless, sterile, but anarchic planetoid, than when camping out at Yosemite Park (with a Park Ranger around every tree to wag his finger at you when you drop trail mix on his flora.)<br /><br />One unique blessing is the lack of english speaking \\"aliens\\" who, aside from a brow ridge or two, are still bipeds who can interbreed, despite having evolved in isolation from each other.

B00005JPAM|5.0|Helen Mirren is getting the requisite kudos for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth.  But there's another portrayal in Stephen Frears' excellent film of an equally public figure that is going relatively overlooked: Michael Sheen's spot-on take on Tony Blair.  I was totally mesmerized at just how perfectly Sheen had both the look and feel of the unbridled optimism of TB at the outset of his first term.  That's key because it's Blair's intuition on  the matters at hand here that are instrumental in shaking the Royal Family out of their tone-deaf dismissal of the unfolding events across the country.<br /><br />It's interesting to see the portrayals here and see how harsh or sympathetic they are (Mirren's Elizabeth is complex and beyond analysis here):<br /><br />Prince Philip - A devastating take on him<br /><br />Price Charles - Painted very sympathetically by Alex Jennings, but obviously cowed by his mother<br /><br />Alastair Campbell - A very positive take on New Labour's wordsmith by Mark Bazeley (I'm a big Campbell fan, so it was good to see the script honor his contributions to Blair's early successes).<br /><br />Queen Mom - Yikes!  Not a very pretty picture<br /><br />Frears' delicate and respectful approach keeps William and Harry just off the picture.<br /><br />What will really take you about the movie is this: as many reviewers here note, they found themselves strangely moved and shocked by Diana's death, like she was a member of the family.  When those scenes play out here, wow, you'll be quite surprised at the emotions that well up in you.  It will happen.  Trust me.<br /><br />Frears - as pitch-perfect movie helmsman - includes the stirring end portion of the eulogy penned and intoned by Charles, Earl of Spencer (Diana's brother).  Spencer's speech is generally regarded as one of the finest eulogies ever rendered.  It has become a part of British textbooks.  Here's the part you hear in the movie:<br /><br />\\"I would like to end by thanking God for the small mercies he has shown us at this dreadful time. For taking Diana at her most beautiful and radiant and when she had joy in her private life.

0670033375|5.0|I highly recommend this book. He starts out examining old societies that failed and why they failed, then slowly moves to modern times. However, reading the environmental issues of the day one comes to quickly realize we are not much different from those collapsed societies of the past. There is hope, in that by realizing and learning from man's past mistakes we may be able to protect our world for future generations to enjoy. 5 stars.

0688014291|4.0|This book is a synopsis of easyt ways to evaluate and resolve conflicts in a business environment.  To the point.
0446677450|5.0|I found 'Rich dad, Poor dad' to be a great read. <br />Its very practical in its approach and very insightful. <br />I'm currently studying Commerce, Accounting/Marketing and definately would recommend it to anyone including those with a finance background. <br />Sometimes its hard to think outside the square and Robert Kiyosaki definately does. <br /> <br />I'm 20 and I'm glad I found this book at this point in my life, I'm saving up for a down payment for my first property :) <br /> <br />All in all GREAT BOOK!!!!!
B00006ZXSK|3.0|This is a lovely charming film full of promise.  It falls short but is a great joy to watch none the less. <br /> <br />You never quite believe that Ms Barrymore is a serf and you never quite believe that her leading man is a prince.   <br /> <br />It is full of humour and great sets & costumes and its heart is in the right place, presenting a fairy tale with a feminist lilt.
B000HC2LIK|3.0|For me, the definitive Blade Runner so far is the theatrical release. That's the one I've been enjoying on laserdisc for lo these many years. Obviously I won't be buying this DVD. <br /> <br />I won't argue a matter of taste. If you really thought the movie was better without narration and other changes in the Director's Cut, then it is still questionable whether you should own this. If you agreed with Ridley Scott's first attempt to tamper with the film for home video, then surely there is a good chance you will appreciate his expanded editions even more.  <br /> <br />Either way, it is a good bet that you will be happier if you wait for the ultimate, primo, all-in-one set to come next year. Maybe the director will wow me with one of his new edits, but I consider Harrison Ford's narration to be a classic and integral part of the movie. You just can't tamper with that without losing the character of the original.
B00003CWLF|4.0|This is a voluptous production of a fascinating story.  Chow Yun Fat is marvellous as the complex, conflicted leader caught between the beauty and tradition of the past and the inevitability and potentially tragic future for himself, his family and his people.  Jodie Foster is impeccable as Anna, a woman who is of England and all that was Colonial but with a love for the beauty and wonder of the indigenous. <br /> <br />Their magentism to each other is heartfelt and compelling.  This film is one step away from being a truly great movie and it is difficult to find the moment where it falters from its destiny. <br /> <br />i love this film but am always left with a sense of missed opportunity.
B000002H97|5.0|This is best album of Metallica in years. Great riffs, melodies and special techniques. Great one!!! A must have in any collection!!
B0007CNXUK|5.0|This Movie is great you will really enjoy watching. Two great acting performances by Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet. I was blown away by the performances of the children as well, every character makes you feel for them personally. That is a sign of a great movie. Everytime I watch I break down in tears.

0316743003|5.0|Excellent book on Lockheed's black aircraft, how they were developed, and probably as much as the public should know about what they could do.  I do have to confess that I am an aero engineer, so my thoughts on this book are a bit biased, but reading about these airplanes was simply fascinating.  My only disagreement was that the author called the Stealth Fighter ugly, and that's pretty small potatos.  He also discusses the U-2's short reign as the premier spyplane, and the dominance of the SR-71. <br />This book gets a whole-hearted 5 stars!!!
B00000K3D4|5.0|This amazed me when it first came out and still has that capability.  The combination of puppets and live action works really well, David Bowie is wonderful, and, all in all, it's a great family film.  When I gave it to my two granddaughters, ages 8 & 4, they watched it wide-eyed and a little bit scared. But then they watched it at least once a day for the next week.
0440241901|4.0|I found this book to be very enjoyable.....it has humor and a message. We all say things that we don't think will be paid attention but this story tells us that sometimes we say something and when it's repeated we are appalled. When we are respected for it later is a bonus. I think women of all ages would enjoy this story.
0156027321|1.0|The only book I've ever read that I tore up and threw in the trash when I was finished. If this passes for an uplifting magical fable then there's something seriously wrong with the world.This is a tragic, sad, grotesque, disturbing tale of a child so traumatized that he has to make up an alternate reality just to cope with the horror of the world. When a child is damaged it is never uplifting, whimsical or funny and anyone who finds it so better take a deep look into themselves and make some changes. This book is sickening. Don't buy it!!! There are no animals only pain and death.
0312330537|4.0|This book is great.  You feel like you are there with him while he does all that happens in this book.  I don't want to say to much and give away the plot but this book had me hooked from page one.

055358202X|2.0|The wait was long. I even had a reminder on my Outlook for the day Feast was coming out.<br /><br />What can I say? As much as the previous books were excellent, so much the disappointment from this one. I can't understand what happened to Martin: it's as if he deliberately goes against himself and the saga he created. For a start, there are no Jon Snow chapters. Wait, also no Daenerys... what's going on? Hey, no Tyrion? What did I buy this book for? It goes on: no mention at all of Bran and Rickon, etc.<br /><br />Instead, we get endless (!) semi-psychological chapters from Cersei Lannister's view, supposedly allowing us to follow her totally losing her sanity (convincing? better say \\"embaracing\\"). Jaime goes on (and on, and on...) lamenting his lost hand. And then again, for a few more chapters. Well, you get the idea.<br /><br />I am really puzzled. I loved the previous books. I truly believe GRRM has proved himself to be a great writer. I still give him the credit that he might be building something here, that will be fulfilled in the next book. Be warned, however: the road is long, slow, and (sad to admit) disappointing, on the verge of boring.
B0009QTS1M|5.0|You don't have to talk too much about this movie, everybody knows that it was one of the greatest superproduction of all times, the actors, the sites, the pictures, all this things makes it unic... <br />The feature of the DVD is great!, 3 dvds to enjoy a lot of extras... <br />You can't have an epic collection without this dvd...
0066620996|5.0|\\"Good to Great\\" by Jim Collins is a must read for any serious leader in the profit or not for profit sector.  This books shows how others transform their companies.  The ways we teach people to get ahead are in no way indicative of true leadership -- servant-leaders who put their company and people ahead of their personal goals.  Jim Collins' nails it with his research of good companies who have moved to become great companies.
B000GCFO08|5.0|Great movie! I live near Centralia, Pennsylvania, so I can personally relate to the scary setting of the movie.
B00005JNEI|5.0|of course, 20/20 hindsight is always nice in cases like this, but, i was a huge supporter of this film when it was still 'against the country' to do so...i reviewed it back then for 'another' publication, and, of course, as we know, many people lost their jobs over such a 'treasonous act'...(fortunately, i was not one of them...)... <br /> <br />but time has revealed to (almost) all that the bush administration lied from the get-go and has been lying ever since... <br /> <br />and contrary to one or two stragglers who still think bush won florida...KNOCK IT OFF!!!!!!...when the 'so-called' recount was done, it never took into account all the 'illegal' butterfly ballots that had candidates names on both sides of the ballot (which is againast florida state law), causing many to vote for pat buchanan by accident...(no to mention the disinfranchised democrats who weren't allowed to vote due to republican strong-arming...) <br /> <br />and, the sad fact that, by now, that i would still have to tell anyone left in america about the wicked ways of this administration, just goes to prove that some, no matter how much truth is placed before them, will still ignore common sense and follow the path that leads to their own destruction... <br /> <br />next time, this country better not wait for the 'bell curve' to catch up with those who already know...
B0000A1RJI|5.0|that's all that matters. He loves the \\"Deadman's Chest\\" soundtrack even better, but loves to listen to both of them while he's playing in his room. And he absolutely must have one of them turned on when he's going to bed. Maybe he has pirate dreams. I'm just excited that he really likes this kind of music. How many 4-year-olds do you know go around singing \\"da-da-da.....da.da.da.da.da. da-da-dahhhhhh\\" to the Kraken score in his head?
B000FP2OPY|4.0|I ended up purchasing this series because I had to see what all the hype was about. I happen to LOVE X-files, and since everyone was comparing this show to the X-files, and it had high ratings, I figured I should give it a try.<br /><br />Now I dont find this show anything like the X-files, it is definately darker, and a quite a bit spookier than X-files ever was.  I do happen to be a HUGE fan of horror, and this show is definately more horror than sci-fi.  One of my main issues is the episodes are almost all identical (to me at least).  The brothers always get into one scrape or another with an Urban Legend(I happen to be familiar with all the Urban Legends they are facing down)that they barely escape from by the skin of their teeth, and after breaking several laws they hop into their car and drive off to some classic rock n roll (excellent EXCELLENT soundtrack)<br /><br />However, it is mildly entertaining to watch-but as far as any real imagination?  The writers for this show really need to step it up a few notches in order to achieve any depth.  Hopefully as the show develops as the seasons go on.<br /><br /> One of my main issues would be \\"believeability\\", and yes I KNOW the shows basis is in fantasy/horror/legends, however in several scrapes with law enforcement, its just not realistic, unless ALL of law enforcement are truly idiotic bumpkins, that are incapable of properly retaining a suspect;in one episode a brother escapes from the precinct after being handcuffed to a table in the interrogation room, and in another episode a brother takes on several officers in hand-to-hand combat-knocking all of the officers unconcious for an unknown amount of time, also in another episode where the brothers were fighting for their lives against a curse (which was supposed to last all night), and it lasted all of (MAYBE) 5 minutes then it was morning again.<br /><br />All in all it is an alright show, albeit there are some areas where it needs help, but its ok if nothing else is on TV.<br />-Just a note on this I rated this at 3 stars, I have NO idea why Amazon is saying I give it 4, Im trying to get it adjusted...on this I rated this at 3 stars, I have NO idea why Amazon is saying I give it 4, Im trying to get it adjusted...
0446691437|5.0|Not only is this the best book on the creative process I've ever read, it is also a great work on the nature of Good and Evil. Even though it deals with aspects of the spirt, it is no-nonsense, down to earth and immensely  practical. Read a sentence, get inspired, and get to work.
B000G0O5N2|5.0|It often seems that moments of courage are a result of military expedience characterized simultaneously with a predilection of military ineptness. How a general could ever let his men enter a maze-like city surrounded by thousands of hostile inhabitants is beyond comprehension. Sam Shepard as that general exceeded the scope of his mission and his command putting his men in harm's way in broad daylight. Ridley Scott seems uniquely capable of ferreting out the military decisions that led to this debacle but places no blame. However, all the blame is up there on the screen if you choose to take note similar to the way Sam Shepard watches it on his TV monitor. Scott instead places the viewer into a 180-degree maelstrom of bullets, bombs, shrapnel, blood, sweat and tears. In 160 years of technology it is amazing how some of the images are reminiscent of the last stand at the Alamo. What has been learned in all those years? Every good war film needs a hero and Tom Sizemore gives the best performance as one hardened and dedicated officer. The most interesting shot in this film is where a tired and weary group of Americans finally emerge from the city covered in dirt, gunpowder, blood and grease and they are greeted by foreign United Nations troops wearing turbans. These UN fellows offer the Americans glasses of water served from silver trays with white linen napkins draped over their arms. So much for modern technology it would seem.

And the two come into direct conflict... They know that the only true test can be when one outdraws and kills the other... The inexorable outcome is a tense showdown... With such equal abilities a split second is the difference between life and death... The two friends square up and draw in the same instant and simultaneously... Kline is surprisingly effective as the cowboy with a troubled past and Dennehy, as Sheriff Cobb, generates a palpable menace...<br /><br />Scott Glenn is a professional gunslinger, not an angel or a traditional 'goodie' by any means but a man with a certain honor and nobility... His life is a series of confrontations... He plans to start life over in California with his brother Jake but, as ever, there are always punks who wants to take him down...Glenn does not have the screen presence of some of the other characters of the film, but the action-oriented films ideally suited him...<br /><br />Kevin Costner is charismatic as the sympathetic young hotshot gunslinger, soft at heart... He measures his self by his fancy double gun belt... Wearing two guns, he kills two armed guys in a couple of seconds with two shots-- one bursts from each pearl-handled gun--and he didn't even aim...<br /><br />Danny Glover must overcome the racism of Turley to find the 'baddies' who killed his old father and wounded his sister...

0060931671|3.0|Whether a fact is discovered because it is unsettling, out of place, or merely noticed at random, that fact, when investigated, can sometimes reveal a whole alternative reality.   Such was the experience of Oedipa Maas when she found, among obscene bathroom graffiti, a symbol of a muted bugle accompanied with a question, \\"Interested in some sophisticated fun?\\"  This begins a bizarre, hallucination-like, Da-Vince-Code-resembling quest to understand this symbol, and the motives of a past lover, whom now she is assigned as co-executor of his will.  This quest will reach back through the textual disputes of a Jacobean revenge play, to the renaissance ages in the low lands of Europe, to San Francisco and back again to a mythical suburb of Los Angeles, called San Narciso.  Connecting these places and eras is an underground postal service created as an attempt to usurp one of Europe's ancient thrones by controlling its means of communication.  Maas herself will ponder this conspiracy, finding it \\"so labyrinthine that it must have meaning beyond just a practical joke\\" Yet she also entertains the possibility that she is \\"fantasying some such plot, in which case [she is] a nut...out of [her] skull.\\"  What explains such an outrageous plot?    This novel shoots off metaphors in every direction, (or is it all one big metaphor?) and a great deal of the mental energy one spends with it will certainly lay in trying to answer the question \\"So what does it all mean?\\"  Surely Pynchon did not sit down merely to write a nice story about an ancient underground postal service that now caters to San Francisco's social misfits and outcasts.  So what DOES it all mean?  Paradoxically, the themes of disconnectedness and entrapment play heavily.  In the first chapter, Oedipa reflects:    \\"What did she so desire escape from?  Such a captive maiden, having plenty of time to think, soon realizes that her tower, its height and architecture, are like her ego only incidental: that what really keeps her where she is is magic, anonymous and malignant, visited on her from outside and for no reason at all.....  If the tower is everywhere and the knight of deliverance no proof against its magic, what else?\\"     Pynchon suggests that this tower is particularly modern, and he even hints that it is particularly American.  By the end of the novel, she has an idea of the tower, it is \\"a great digital computer, the zeros and ones twinned above, hanging like balanced mobiles right and left, ahead, thick, maybe endless.\\" Her anxiety is an experience of vertigo before the virtual noise and bottomless web of modernity.  It is that noise that cuts her off from her husband, and from meaning in general.  What should be one line of communication, one postal service, has split into two: an official, government sponsored (and imposed) line and an underground line.  We can certainly sense political dimension to Oedipda's predicament, but it is not only political.  It reaches through all of experience, it is the foundation of San Narciso and is her tower.  She despairs that a nation could \\"allow\\" such a town as San Narsico.  Pierce Inverarity, Oedipda's former love, owned San Narciso, and the legacy that he passes to Oedipa, \\"was America.\\"     With some thought, some piecing together of his clues, we can come closer to an understanding of this novel, but we can never be quite sure.  There are layers of parallel stories (Oedipa, the Couriers tragedy, the Gallipoli film), where people are on a hunt to piece together a cohesive narrative, that may or may not exist.  Even as the novel conludes, the extent and nature of this postal service, the Truth, is not revealed.  Who is the secret man who bids on Lot 49?  Is our pursuit just another layer to the novel's game?  Have we involved ourselves in yet another indecipherable web, that web that is called \\"The Crying of Lot 49\\"?  Is it a metaphor for modernity or a layer of modernity?     Yet, all of this remains a purely intellectual enterprise.  Shouldn't the novel (or, The Novel) involve joy as well at the mind?  Unless one takes pleasure in a literary rubix cube, I would not call this a satisfying book.  Once you delve into the puzzle of this novel, one is rewarded with the stock themes of post-modernism: disconnectedness, entrapment, endless webs of white noise, meaninglessness, anxiety, reflections on The Word, the metaphor, and their respective levels of inadequacy.  At some point it has to be interesting for its own sake. If the proof of the pudding is in the eating, the proof of a novel in in the reading. Call me sentimental, call me a philistine, but pass me the Dickens!
B0001US8EO|4.0|\\"Law and Order\\" (1932), a film starring Walter Huston and Harry Carey, had blazed the Earp screen trail with a brave version of the 0. K. Corral happenings, although the true-life characters were never named... \\"Frontier Marshal\\" (1939) starring Randolph Scott and \\"Wichita\\" (1955) with Joel McCrea also told the story...<br /><br />To most modern cinema-goers, however, the Corral incident and the confused events and motivations which led to it have been best served by four films, John Ford's \\"My Darling Clementine\\" (1946), John Sturges' \\"Gunfight at the O.K. Corral,\\" (1957), Sturges' \\"Hour of the Gun\\" (1967), and George P. Cosmatos' \\"Tombstone\\" (1993). But the question has yet to be solved: should the American West be depicted on the screen as it actually was, or should it continue to be a form of mythology?<br /><br />Hollywood's version of history is considerably at variance with the facts, and life on the frontier in the 19th century would appear to have been more dull and monotonous than exciting and colorful... Certainly, life in Tombstone, Arizona, in its time of greatest prosperity as a mining town must have been anything but healthy, with its vast number of rough working men relieving their boredom with drinking and brawling, and occasionally shooting each other...<br /><br />In Kasdan's epic Western, Earp is the upright defender of the law, and Doc, a dissolute gambler... Nevertheless, the men are compassionate and respectful, and both have a kind of dignity... Holliday is much more credible as the black sheep of an aristocratic Virginia family and a jaded idealist... Dennis Quaid allowed himself to lose 30 pounds of his weight only to accurately portray the gun-notorious Doc Holliday, now, alas devoted to the bottle and in the latter stages of tuberculosis...<br /><br />In this instance we have Quaid breathing fire and fury at the slightest hint of an insult before breathing more heavily into his handkerchief... He's a multi-dimensional human being who provides most of the film's best moments... His character has his own form of ability... Quaid does a far better work of portraying the effects of Holliday's tuberculosis... Kilmer, in \\"Tombstone,\\" never seems to have anything worse than a bad flu, except when it's dramatically necessary for him to look bad in greater degree...<br /><br />Earp (Kevin Costner) finds Doc sincere but nevertheless strikes up an understanding which one feels will blossom into grudging joint gun-action should the need arise... The need is obviously there in villainous Clantons and McLaurys... The path is well and truly pointed to that rendezvous at the Corral...<br /><br />Kasdan's motion picture covers areas of Earp's life that George P. Cosmatos' film \\"Tombstone\\" does not even touch... While \\"Tombstone\\" was an action picture, centering on the events leading up to and including the famous gunfight, Lawrence Kasdan's \\"Wyatt Earp\\" focused on the man himself and his life from childhood to the confrontation and beyond...The film starts with the teenage Earp and progresses through old age...<br /><br />The action in Kasdan's film is firm and fresh, nicely photographed and the story well told... But we always remember Ford's \\"My Darling Clementine\\" for its other qualities--for the unhurried lulls and the 'time off' taken on the way... This is Ford indulging himself, as was his habit, but on this occasion the indulgences all come off and are imparted with magic...<br /><br />\\"My Daring Clementine\\" was a film of touches--Fonda, seated, adjusting his boots and his balance while the world, such as it is, goes by; Fonda, the peacemaker, right-and-properly in church; Fonda, with an old-world frontier concept of courtesy leading his lady in the out of doors dance...<br /><br />Earp in Kasdan's biopic is an ordinary man who met and married a beautiful young woman who died of typhoid a short time after the marriage... Profoundly bitter about her death, he goes from a drunken fellow to horse thief to buffalo hunter to stagecoach driver to Dodge City, Kansas where he became one of the most famous \\"Westerners\\" of all time...one of the most famous \\"Westerners\\" of all time...
B000009ROK|5.0|This is the best collection of Luis Miguel's most romantic songs.  Lots of boleros, very beautiful lyrics.  We were looking for a great bolero for our first dance at our wedding.  There were lots to choose from, so we found the perfect tempo.  I highly recommend this collection to anyone who loves Luis Miguel or wants to get to know his music. Enjoy!
B00006FDCJ|5.0|'Unforgiven' is a magnificent piece of film-making, yet a dark and troubling study in violence and machismo... It revels in memorable statements of crudeness and cruelty... Munny sums it up best: \\"Hell of a thing killing a man. You take away all he's got. All he's ever gonna have.\\"<br /><br />Aided by Jack N. Green's cinematography and Lennie Niehaus's music, Eastwood gives the film an ensemble portrait of sorrowful beauty...<br /><br />Clint Eastwood shows another face of the Old West... He is perfect as the unforgiven, the stone killer, whose eyes are full of brutally painful memories...<br /><br />Will Munny (Eastwood) is a retired bad man desperate for the 'whore's gold' to save his shabby farm, two kids, and sick animals in the vast emptiness of the Colorado range... Munny had a monogamous devotion to the wife he'd lost, and is forced to confront his own past no matters how he tries to avoid it...<br /><br />Eastwood is supported by some quite outstanding character actors whose performances are impeccable:<br /><br />Gene Hackman plays Little Bill Daggett, the town sadistic sheriff who rules with an iron fist, forbidding anyone to carry guns across the town limits... He is a lawman cold as ice, who hates \\"assassins and men of low character.\\" He also despises reward-chasers and tries to humiliate them, revealing their cowardice and indecision... In his judgment, he declines to punish a crime in a way that the hookers consider appropriate...<br /><br />Morgan Freeman plays Ned Logan, Munny's longtime honest partner, who ensures the compassionate balance that keeps his friend from sinking in a self-pitying haze of recklessness and bitterness, but he also launches Will into one of the bloodiest shootout in that untamed place...<br /><br />Richard Harris is English Bob, the egotistical gunfighter who desires to leave the hospitality of Big Whiskey behind him...

0743454537|5.0|The title caught my eye, and then the synopsis on the back caught my eye and i decided to take the book to the counter and buy it. It was 1 pm in the afternoon. byt 7 pm, i had finished it. My husband was told politely and without question our son was his to take care of for the afternoon that I was heading to the tub to sit and read and enjoy a good book.<br /><br />It's a horrid story, it's a sad story, the subject matter at least. That parents would have a child basically as spare parts for thier first daughter. But it evolves, somewhat choppily at times, and the flashbacks are sometimes at akward places, and byt he time i reached the end and then went back to read the very first page i was having to put the book down and have a real good cry.<br /><br />In my eyes, a book like that, that can have me crying for 5 minutes and elict such emotion from me deserves to be read, deserves to be shared. I promptly was teased by my husband for becomgin so involved and immersed in the book. I hadn't cried over a good book like this since the \\"dogs of babel\\" which is exactly where this book is going to sit beside and be picked up when i need to read it again. I throughly suggest this book. the subject is touchy and controversial, but this family is one that you will want to slip into and look at all of them and want to jsut wrap thier arms around each one.
0792163710|5.0|'Shane' is not a Western like Howard Hawk's 'Red River', nor a meditation on history and character like John Ford's \\"The Searchers.\\" It is the most tasteful achievement ever invented to create a legend, an instant myth... Only Stevens' meticulously picturesque visuals and his evident desire to treat Western as art, could have mastered the archetypal simplicity and vitality of 'Shane.'<br /><br />In 'Shane,' the good and evil govern Stevens' mastery of technique... With his golden good looks, his calm authority, and his almost magical magnetism, Alan Ladd is the mysterious lone rider called Shane... His antithesis - a sinister figure all in sable - and enemy, a merciless gunfighter from the Cheyenne area, named Jack Wilson (Jack Palance).<br /><br />Wilson is dark, dresses in black, and even drinks black coffee from a dark black pot... Shane sparkles with personality and presence... Wilson spreads menace and evil... Shane is 'the fastest gun alive' who shoots to kill only when it is inevitable... Wilson - wearing two guns, and walking with jangling spurs - is a psychopath and a sadist, a man totally without moral redemption...<br /><br />The film controls that mystical force that runs like a fine thread through a Western story - the mysterious gunslinger who rides into town at exactly the right moment that history requires him, fulfills his destiny and then rides on...<br /><br />There is novelty and charm in 'Shane' because the stranger, who appears from nowhere, is a man of exceptional quality, admired by a wonderful kid with bright face and resolute boyish ways... Shane tests the spirit of this little eight year-old boy, Joey Starrett (Brandon De Wilde) in the midst of all the tensions and excitements on that open range...<br /><br />What is admirable about Shane is not his skill with his gun, but his restraint in using it... Shane knows that Joey is admiring him for the wrong reasons-- even though he knows that if he kills Wilson, he'll have to leave the valley... He tells Joey: 'There's no living with a killing.' However we want him to show Joey how brave and fast he is... The ultimate confrontation in that depressed and faint saloon gives the movie the quality of a fine album of paintings of the frontier...<br /><br />Joey's plaintive call ('Come back, Shane') is the famous cry of all the audience for a mythical idolized hero so complete and correct, who would not permit himself to be admired by a boy for living by the gun... The closing scenes remain among the most haunting memories in the history of cinema...<br /><br />The characters that Stevens' actors have drawn might be considered portraits of familiar frontier types:<br /><br />- Marian Starrett (Jean Arthur) is the mother who criticizes Shane for initiating her young boy into young manhood by passing on his values... She is the little woman unsettled who always wanders: 'What are you fighting for? She is the married woman who reveals an unspoken love...<br /><br />- Joe Starrett (Van Heflin), is the stubborn father and a hard working rancher determined, with his forcible patience and fortitude, to build a life on the land for his family...<br /><br />- Rufus Ryker (Emile Meyer) is the evil aging cattle rancher who considers the arrival of homesteaders is reducing grazing opportunities for his herds limiting their access to water... He does everything to rid the land of the humble farmers...<br /><br />- Morgan Ryker (John Dierkes) is Rufus' brother/foreman, who invites Starrett to \\"talk\\" reasonably...<br /><br />- Chris Calloway (Ben Johnson) is the authentic cowboy who has had a change of heart and has quit Ryker's bunch... He warns Shane in the barn that \\"Starrett is up against a stacked deck.\\"<br /><br />- Frank 'Stonewall' Torrey (Elisha Cook Jr.) is the pale-eyed pathetic local farmer who, in a fit of fury and mad courage, attempts to challenge his tormentor... But an outraged amateur can never beat an accomplished professional... He is brutally gunned downin the first shocking and horrific showdown on the Western screen... Palance toys with the little man and kills him in one of the most realistic scenes staged until that time...<br /><br />\\"Shane\\" is an immensely beautiful film, stunningly photographed in color, rich in memorable and exhilarating moments... Every scene is composed with extreme care:<br /><br />- The deer will raise its head and frame the oncoming rider perfectly between the branches of his antlers...<br /><br />- Shane's first appearance descending into a majestic valley rimmed by mountains, shining a pearl-handled 'six-shooter' gun...<br /><br />- Shane friendship with Joe Starrett, cemented that evening as together they swing axes in common task to cut and pull up a large tree stump...<br /><br />- Their energy battle (filmed through the windows of the cabin and through the frantic, kicking hooves of horses disturbed by their vicious struggle) to determine who will go to town to face Ryker's hired gun...<br /><br />- Shane slow ride into town for a showdown... The low tracking camera angle, the darkness, and the musical soundtrack emphasize Shane's heroic yet lonely position on the horizon, set among the wide view of the mountains...<br /><br />Certainly \\"Shane\\" is a romantic film, and yet it is full of integrity about time and place... It may be interesting to compare the idealized interest, attraction and love between Shane and Marion with the unspoken love between John Wayne and Dorothy Jordan in 'The Searchers.' In the latter film, Dorothy caresses Wayne's army cape and is observed by Ward Bond, who simply notices her gesture and looks away... In 'Shane', Marion implies her love for Shane as she cautions her son Joey about becoming attached to him...<br /><br />In \\"Shane,\\" Stevens combined so many elements that are 'classically' required and combines them so well... He directed 'Shane' with great feeling, and turned it into a classic.... He is brutally gunned down in the first shocking and horrific showdown on the Western screen...

B0000TB01Y|5.0|Wicked is a back story to the popular story of the Wizard of Oz.  the back story places the Good Witch of the North, Galinda, and the Wicked Witch of the West, Elphaba, when they both attended college at Shiz University and where roommates as well as friends.  Unexpected circumstances change their fates forever but they never forget each other.  The cast brings the story to life and illustrates that compassion and friendship can breakdown all walls in the end.  I highly recommend this album to everyone.
1932100660|5.0|Excellent, comprehensive, authortative, a must-read for anyone interested in maintaining and promoting good health. <br />                                   TLWarren,MD
0792833201|5.0|Wonderful movie! Just as cheesy and freaky as I remembered them! <br />Great condition and timely service.
B00003CXDD|5.0|Willow is a giddy rampage through a medieval fantasy world. Everyone will laugh and cheer on Willow's kind hearted hero as he helps save a baby from a wicked queen. You'll love it whether you're a teenager, a parent looking to share a film with your kids, or a child.  Like The Princess Bride, Willow transcends its genre. The movie is funny and inspirational. The baby is cute, the hero is a parent who learns to believe in himself, and the love story is delicious. You have to buy it because one viewing is not enough.
0060899190|4.0|Now that I have both PostSecret books, I've come to like this one much more. It's more adult like, and less aimed at teens (which is something that, while it fits my demographic, really turned me off about it). Maybe it has something to do with the raw emotions behind these postcards. It just drives me nuts and sends chills up my spine to read some of them. The layout could be better, but the content makes it worth it!
0887307280|5.0|For over 5 years, I was a solopreneur.  I pretty much bought myself a job.  After reading this book, I started to learn how to automate parts of my business and create a system for everything.  The result:  I now have more time to focus on the important things.  Before I felt I was running around at a high speed with one foot nailed to the ground.  If you are serious about running a successful business, this is a must have in your library.
B0000025T6|4.0|Nice album based on very few special effects, solid musical craftsmanship.
B00008DDRX|5.0|So the title leaves room for 'contenders' to come up with a 'best racing film of the 21st century'. IMHO, SPEED channel has all the makings of a team that could pull it off. (under a partnership deal with a 'smart' studio, that doesn't want to overplay the plot -- just stick to the 'formula' [sic] that worked for Steve McQueen ...) All they need to do is get Michael Schumacher to 'come out of retirement' and shoot a film sanctioned by F1, that shadows Michael on his way to his 'final'-- record setting championship season of 2004 --- exposing the 'drama and emotions' that surrounded this history making season for Ferrari and Michael. Really, who needs more of a plot than that?
0679805273|5.0|i love this book and i will always remember it. Im sure you will never forget it either. His stories are for all ages. From 4 year olds to seniors off to college :]
0143036556|5.0|Excellent book, albeit a bit dense. It is very much on point, especially in light of the current debate about the climate change and its impact on humanity.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|One of the best films in years, would be a pity to miss this.
0393317552|5.0|One the best books on the subject. A must read, but you need to know your history and geography first, if not, have a map ready. Be prepared for a fast and furious ride through time and geography, but with constant flashbacks to the present. You will not look at the world the same way after finishing this book, provided that you have the intellectual capacity and curiousity to read it cover to cover.
0393327345|5.0|I was so surprised by the ending I had to read it again.  Everything in the book suddenly had a different meaning.  Perfectly orchestrated.
B000053VAZ|4.0|I personally liked the movie, and I'm not a particular fan of romance. Admittendly, one could think \\"Oh, Depp being weird again,\\" but this is not a rehash of any of his other characters. (To my knowledge...)<br /><br />It is what is is, for good and ill: light romantic fluff, with a twist. That twist was the idea of the conflict between what seems best and what actually is, which added the element that made the movie noteworthy. For the record, this is only a \\"romantic comedy\\" in the classical sense: it isn't funny, so don't watch it for chuckles or laughs. Depending on your sense of humor, you might, but don't expect it.<br /><br />As an aside, the brother's reaction was a little overkill, in my opinion, but acceptable. (I think that the reaction he had to the budding romance should have been attenuated a touch.) This wasn't a movie killer, by any means, but I did think they treated that character a touch harshly.
1881273156|4.0|This is an excellent book to learn how to understand your own love language as well as your spouse's needs to be loved in her way.
1594200106|5.0|I've never been so enraptured by a book in my life.  The combination of genres, storylines, and the visualization of a dynamic imaginary world placed within the rigid stasis of history struck me senseless.  Never have I had a novel grab me so tenderly and pull me through so effortlessly as Shadow of the Wind.  There was no point in the novel where I doubted my want to continue to read.  I adore and am indebted to this novel for the world it created for me as a freshman in college, an inspiration to embrace creativity and fact alike.
1560100842|5.0|This book covers from creation of a character until its 2D animation. A great guide, even to me, a 3D animator student.
B00000JNNY|5.0|Loved the CD .  Hard to believe that Etta James was a teenager when she recorded these songs.  Her voice is flawless.  I am a new fan.
B0001EFTTM|5.0|Nosferatu is a truly frightening movie.  The cinematography is beautiful and shows a Europe that no longer exists.  The movie is dreamlike, nightmarish, and makes it seem that vampires are very real.
B00005NWLO|4.0|Great live album. I bought this on vinyl many years ago and still enjoy it today. Most live recordings are not very clear and leave a lot to be desired. This is one of the exceptions. I would strongly recommend this to any Skynyrd fan.
0743289412|1.0|I tried. I pushed on just past 100 pages.  What happened to the Stephen King who grabbed his readers on the first page and never let go? Is there no editor who will dare to take a red pencil to The King? \\"Lisey's Story\\" drags, meanders and disappoints. Maybe it gets GREAT after pave 114...I couldn't spare the time to find out.
B000G759LW|5.0|I really enjoy both of these CDs - Christina's talent for writing and singing once again shine through in this compilation of songs. My favorite songs are Back in the Day, Ain't No Other Man, Slow Down Baby, Still Dirrty, Candyman, Nasty Naughty Boy and Hurt. Christina also included a song called Thank You for her fans that have stuck by her, and the song alone says it all! Great CD's, and I recommend them highly!
B000F1IQNM|5.0|The movie you need is Nanny McPhee!  This was a delightful movie. How the children are tamed by this mysterious nanny that is as ugly as the childrens' behavior.  Soon their manners as well as her appearance slowly become as beautiful as they are meant to be.  Then nobody needs Nanny McPhee anymore as all have been taught the necessary lessons. I loved it.
B000GY729M|4.0|In the begining I didn't like this album, but after listening to it it grew on me. It is so different from the Killers first album that it takes a little getting used to it. Once your beyond their first album you'll start to realize what a great album it is. It does sound a lot like Bruce Springsteen though.
0671027344|4.0|Despite the snide and scathing Publishers Weekly review, I found this book worth every moment. Granted, Charlie cries a lot, and his super-sensitivity and high level of naivete doesn't always ring true (he's 16, after all, not 12 or 13). Regardless, as Charlie learned about being true to himself, about \\"participating in life,\\" about the pain that living to the fullest can bring, and about the beauty he can find in anything if he looks hard enough, I found myself brimming alternately with laughter and with tears. In the vein of Bett Williams' Girl Walking Backwards or even the oft-compared Catcher in the Rye, The Perks of Being a Wallflower captures with heartaching accuracy those tenderest and most formative of years. I loved it.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|If this movie is your cup of tea I highly recommend it, great Movie <br />Kate is one of the best actresses out there right now. <br />
0385335997|5.0|Ms. Gabaldon has kept the story alive for me once again. She knows how to keep the reader hooked on the characters and the premise of going back in time. I can't wait to read the next book.
0596007124|5.0|In collage, I remember entering the office of one of my great professors Dr/Eng Moustafa Hamzah who were teaching us quantum physics and the theory of relativity at that year. I found him holding a book about quantum physics with the word \\"Introduction\\" in its title and I asked him why he is reading an introduction on a subject he is considered one of the highest authorities in it in many countries? He replied me saying \\"It uses an interesting approach which will help me better explains it to you guys\\". This was my first meeting with the word \\"approach\\" and after I read the book and compared it to the text book we used to use, I started realizing the importance of the approach in transitioning the brain from the Huh? to the Aha! in the learning process. <br /> <br />Like most of developers out there, I started my patterns journey with the GOF bible. While it is a great book, it is not an easy read for sure, even in the eyes of its authors as it was clearly stated in the introduction when they said \\"Don't worry if you don't understand this book completely on the first read. We didn't understand it all on the first writing!\\" Head First Design Pattern's authors took the challenge of presenting a complex subject in an easy to follow and understand, simple and interesting way and they delivered on their promise. Don't, mistakenly, confuse simplicity with ease. The subject is still Software Design Pattern which is, by nature, not an easy subject. The authors didn't try to make it easy by over simplifying it and barely scratching the surface. They just introduced the subject in a new approach that sets a new standard for teaching and presenting hard concepts in such a way that your brain will not only make the transition from the Huh? To the Aha! more quickly and comfortably but also will retain these concepts for long time to come. <br />  <br />All of the new comers to Design Pattern are extremely lucky to have this book to start with. The examples are in Java, but any C# developer, like me, will have no hard time at all following and understanding the code and the concepts. If you are thinking of getting your feet wet with patterns, don't start anywhere else. Save your self lots of long nights and few, unnecessarily, lost hair by reading this book first. Don't take my word for it, just stop by any book store and read the first chapter which explains the Strategy pattern. You will immediately know what I am talking about. I will take this chance to thank the authors and the whole organization behind this book for the great work and the extreme pride they took in producing it. I only wish there are more, lots more, of this series on the shelf. <br /> <br />
B000F8O35U|5.0|I'd forgotten how good this film was, I really had, I had vague memories of being sat down in front of a video, and there was a large scary lady in purple doing bad things. But that was it, I'd forgotten how heart-warming and beautiful the film was.<br /><br />The first step toward making this film a true Disney masterpiece, is the fact that the story is so strong. I was totally engrossed by it, and didn't get bored for a moment. I had forgotten about the sweet scenes in the town and by the river, they are what a film needs, character development and just a slight expansion of the story beyond the basic bones of the tale. Sure, it's not a faithful rendition of the original tale, but it isn't about tragedy, it's about love and your dreams coming true.<br /><br />The animation, whilst not as accomplished as some of their slightly later films (such as the Hunchback of Notre Dame) is a delight to behold, and it really makes the mer-people seem very believable in the movement and actions. The animators of Ariel must of been very pleased with themselves, she comes across as being real (well, as real as a cartoon can be) I can see in her facial expressions will genuine expressions, not pale imitations as is so often the case in animation.<br /><br />The soundtrack really makes it, generally, I find Disney side-kicks obtrusive and annoying, but Sebastian makes the film, I never imagined reggae style music could manage to be romantic! The key song, is also beautiful, whilst I don't know the title (shameful I know) the words continue to soar through my mind, 'now we can run....etc.!'<br /><br />The extras are also very worthwhile, a fascinating making of, some games for the children and deleted scenes (utilising unused storyboards.) There is also a commentary and a new music video for 'Kiss the Girl.' However the best of them all has got to be the beautiful and tragic, 'The Little Match-Girl,' I can honestly say that few other films have managed to move me so deeply, I couldn't remembered the last time I cried over a film, until I saw this one. I knew it would be special when I watched the introduction by the director, he mentioned how he use to read the story to his children - it made me remember my parents use to read me the story too. I really hope that it will be Oscar Nominated - it deserves it.<br /><br />Equally satisfying for any child or film critic. A true classic.<br /><br />- Rachael -I couldn't remembered the last time I cried over a film, until I saw this one.

B00006LPEY|5.0|I have been watching a variety of Anime over the last year or so since I finally got around to trying it out and deciding I like much of it-- ones that I've found to be truly great are RahXephon, BoogiePop Phantom, Gungrave, Cowboy Bebop, Ranma 1/2, FLCL and Evangelion.  Others that kept me entertained but were not  as mind-bending good that I've seen are Argento Soma, Betterman, Crest of the Stars, Inuyasha, El Hazard and 12 Kindoms.  I tend to prefer episodes to movies because I don't have to spend quite as much time focused on the TV-- I'm usually on the computer or doing other things at the same time.  But I've seen the movies Laputa: Castle in the Sky and Princess Mononoke both of which were really great. <br /> <br />I was vaguely aware of Akira while getting into Anime, but had the impression that since it wasn't one of the newer bleeding-edge titles that while it's probably good it was not particularly on my \\"must see\\" list.  However, I finally decided to spring for it here on Amazon, and just finished watching it over the weekend.  The word that comes to mind to best describe the experience is simply \\"WOW.\\"  A real roller-coaster ride unlike anything else I've seen.  It took me by surprise as to how really good it is...  It definately goes in my \\"best of\\" list, and if I'd realized it was this good I would have gone for it sooner.  I don't want to go into details and spoil the fun, and none of the descriptions I've read did it any justice anyway-- it was a real surprise (not that I expected it to be bad, I just didn't expect to be quite so impressed by it...).  <br /> <br />Caveats:  there is a fair amount of violence, including blood & guts, etc., and some things in the \\"gross\\" category as well, though all relevant to the story.  And a little bit of nudity.  If such things offend then by all means pass it up...

B000002UHG|5.0|I have been a fan of Rick Wright's talent since July 1971. Why do I know the date? I had just moved to America with my family. We moved into a small house in a small town where, as a boy the telephone poles at the end of the sidewalk were the only world I knew. With one exception; My older brother had a fantasic record collection. He walked in the door after having seen Pink Floyd in Concert. (Note: This is before Dark Side Of The Moon arrived). I remember listening to those early albums with my brother. I liked the way Rick wrote songs for Pink Floyd and missed it when he stopped (or \\"the powers...\\" stopped him). His, Paintbox, See-Saw, Stay and Remember A Day were favorites of mine at the time.<br /><br />This Cd is a hybrid styling of the subconcious Pink Floyd influence that lingers through all of the band's members music. But, this is rich in tone,melody, performance. I hope he puts out another. I listen to this record alot. His use of drum loops and his arranged keyboard textures are of a well seasoned professional with a gift that pours itself through the songs.<br /><br />I understand that much of this music comes from personal inner turmoil (depression, anxiety). It's is truthful and brilliant music played by great musicians and written by a quiet great. Finally he gets his due.<br /><br />I look for more. Oh yeah, it was great to hear and see him play and sing with David Gilmour's band this year.
B000FZEQS2|5.0|THE Movie:<br /><br />If you like spy movies, this is a good movie to consider. Although the movie was made in 2001, It takes you back to the 70's and to many troubled places around the world. One minute you're in Honk Kong, then in divided Germany, the next, you're in Beirut at the time of the Lebanese civil war where a big part of the movie took place. It reminds us of the Berlin Wall and It shows some of the Palestinian people horrible living condition in refugee camps in Lebanon. It also shows the CIA involvement in Mideast assasinations.<br /><br />Robert Redford is the main player in the movie. He appeared much older to me than one of his older spy movie (and one of my favorite) from 1975 \\" Three Days of the Condor\\". He also proved that he is still a great actor.<br /><br />The movie is very entertaining and it keeps you thinking and guessing as more and more information is revealed about \\"Bishop\\" (Brad Pitt) and the intention of the CIA to deal with \\"the problem or crisis at hand\\".<br /><br />THE DVD: (HD DVD)<br /><br />This HD DVD has a great transfer, and the picture quality is excellent! The audio is also great!<br /><br />There are some extra feautures such as deleted scenes, however, none is in high definition or even in good standard DVD quality. I would only only rate the extras one star.<br /><br />Overall, Great Movie, Great Quality HD DVD Transfer. Recommended

B000DZ6VAK|5.0|I like Mozart Piano Concertos a lot. I have several CDs for that by other pianists. This time I listen to Mituko Uchida's performance and I love that. I feel her sensitiveness and power at the same time.  <br />
B00005U11Z|5.0|I became a journey fan about 1 yr ago when my 50 yr old dad took me to see them...I just fell in love with them...I did some research and came about knowing the departion of Steve Perry . Journey is by far one of the most unappreciated bands there are. I highly recommend this dvd because it reflects some wonderfull guitar skills by Neal...If you buy this dvd you defenitely won't be dissapointed.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This document of actual events of real soldiers, real heroes, had me riveted when I first watched the actual HBO special.  Now, I have this amazingly humbling collection so that I can watch it whenever I believe that my own personal sense of self is lacking...I compare myself to these men and, no contest, I don't match up, so, I pick myself up, look myself in the mirror, and know that I have something of a measuring stick to go by. <br /> <br />From training, to D-Day, to the Battle of the Bulge to the Eagle's Nest, SPECTACULAR is what this piece of history is.  If you don't know what any of those references are that I just made above, well, pick this up, take Band of Brothers and make it yours, and LEARN!
0930289234|5.0|what can I say about Watchmen that hasn't already been said.<br /><br />I guess I can say this. It took me a long time to read this comic. Back in the days I was only a Marvel fan and it was inconceivable to read something published by DC.<br /><br />Eventually I broadened my horizons but still I didn't know if I wanted to read about a bunch of characters outside the regular DC universe.<br /><br />With that said, I read the Watchmen, and realized that I had read something special. I used to collect, at my high point, about 40 titles a month (please note that was back when $1.50 was a lot for a comic) and to this day (I am now 33) continue to pay attention to what's going on in comics) and I can say that I will never read any comic better than the Watchmen.<br /><br />The thing that makes this comic great is that in a very short time you feel as if you know each one of these characters like they were friends, or enemies. That is something that some times takes years to happen with other characters. It may never even happen no matter how many comics you read.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor. If you are a comic book fan you must read the Watchmen. Reading the Watchmen is to a comic fan as watching Citizen Kane is to a movie fan.

B000FS9FCQ|2.0|Every conceivable, ridiculous cliche about conservative politicians is exaggerated to the maximum and crammed into this movie.  Imagine Michael Moore writing/directing Batman meets Zorro.<br /><br />V for Vendetta is visually impressive.  It has that dark feel of Tim Burton's films.  Hugo Weaving conveys more emotion from behind a mask than most actors can manage with faces fully exposed.  The fighting scenes -- what few there are -- are enjoyable.<br /><br />At the risk of giving too much away, the hero, V, is a modern-day Guy Fawkes, who is still remembered in England every year on November 5th.  Interestingly -- and without knowing beforehand the connection between V and Guy Fawkes -- I rented and watched this movie on November 5th.  If anything good came out of viewing V for Vendetta is that it made me want to learn more about Guy Fawkes. The movie was otherwise a disappointment.
B00005JPB4|4.0|The photograph of the raising of the American flag at Iwo Jima is one of the most famous pictures of World War II.  It was so moving that three of the surviving soldiers, John Bradley (Phillippe), Rene Gagno (Bradford), and Ira Hayes (Beach), were sent back to America to promote war bonds and raise the American flag at rallies.  Of course, they only raised the replacement flag, but that was kept from the public, lest it detract from what they were trying to accomplish.  \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" jumps between these survivors making appearances to raise money, the war itself, and the interviewing of veterans by James Bradley in the present day.<br /><br />\\"Flags\\" is an interesting look at WWII and the heroes from that war.  It provides an interesting look at what exactly a hero is, and many will be surprised by the true story behind the actual flag raising.  Adam Beach is the standout amongst the cast as the Native American Ira Hayes.  He gives a performance that deserves to be recognized come Oscar time.  The rest of the cast is adequate, but not standout.  Eastwood's direction gets the job done, but I cannot help but think he is a little over his head with all the special effects used to create the battle scenes.  Eastwood is used to movies that are less \\"big\\", and it shows.  Overall, \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" is definitely worth seeing, and will provide a vision of the war that is not widely known by the American public.
B000G759LW|4.0|There are two CD's in this the first CD has all great songs. She has some love songs that were written and sung beautifully! Her second CD I like a couple of songs, its a circus theme back in the day kind of vibe to it, its still good though because girl can sing! So I recommend it!!!
0743201140|5.0|There are thousands of self-help books in the management section of your local bookstore, covering a bewildering spectrum of ideas about how to bring out the best in people. Few of them are helpful, beyond trite statements about human behavior, and even fewer of them are based on more than a modicum of research. Now, Discover Your Strengths is an excellent book on both counts. The Gallup organization has studied excellence in many fields for over thirty years. This book summarizes some of that research from the perspective of identifying and bolstering people's talents. <br /> <br />The writers worked hard to make the book clear, precise, and readable. The book never sacrifices clarity, even when faced with complex ideas. I had to read the book twice to make sure that the straightforward writing wasn't masking conceptual problems. It wasn't. The writers lay out the main idea right away; they write that \\"to excel in your chosen field and to find lasting satisfaction in doing so, you will need to...become an expert at finding and describing and applying and practicing and refining your strengths.\\" They go on to describe precisely what they mean by \\"strengths,\\" then they give you a tool to discover your own strengths by taking an on-line test. <br /> <br />The outstanding thing about Now, Discover Your Strengths is the foundation of research that supports it. The Gallup folks are serious about their research. The claims in this book are based on reliable studies of almost 2 million employees. If you have any doubts about their research methods, the writers supply a technical report on the StrengthsFinder tool in an appendix. I almost wet my pants with glee, reading about interrater reliability, modern test theory, and \\"big five\\" personality factors. All of this is safely ignored in favor of the practical suggestion in the main sections of the book, but it makes a skeptic like me confident in recommending this book to everyone on my team. <br /> <br />Here are the mainreasons why I recommend this book with no reservations: <br /> <br />1) It's based on exhaustive research <br /> <br />2) It comes with a free test...a similar tool  would cost hundreds of dollars if you bought it from a career counselor or management consultant. <br /> <br />3) It is carefully written and eminently practical. <br /> <br />Now, go buy yourself a copy, take the test, and start a strengths revolution at your own workplace.

0790729342|5.0|This is not a bad movie, but it is addictive, anyway. <br /> <br />It's hard to define why this film, the flaws of which are many, is a classic, but that is what it is. Mel Gibson returns to play Max in the (sort-of) sequel to Mad Max. Plot then gets cheesey, characters are cheesy, the villains (led by the Humungous) is double the cheese, and so on. <br /> <br />But if it is cheesy, it more than makes up for it in atmosphere. In a remote part of Australia, the filmmakers create a world entirely their own, and it is generously shared with the audience: a place of simplistic good vs. evil stuff, but a world, nonetheless, and one is drawn into it while viewing the flick. It is that atmosphere, a sense of \\"somewhere-else\\" that draws a person in... and keeps us there. <br /> <br />Plenty of violence and stunts involving cars, trucks, and the occasional helicopter, too. <br /> <br />There is no character development in this movie but, quite simply, there doesn't need to be: every role is perfected from the start, and most of the actors live up to the parts they ae given.
B0000AQS0F|2.0|I bought this series after reading the glowing reviews on this list. This was a serious mistake. This series is flawed to the point of tawdryness. The characters are cardboard stereotypes (the hooker with the heart of gold, etc), the situations hackneyed, the dialogue cliched, the plots boring and predictable, the production values second-rate. In addition, the casting director seems to have chosen a group of actors who are  uncharismatic to a degree that one would not conceive was possible except by direct intent. The standard of excellence for such series is the new Battlestar Galactica; this series is not worthy to lace up BG's space boots.
0937381888|5.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend, because he felt that it was the best book for novice brewers (which I was, and still am to some degree). Unfortunately, I got it AFTER I brewed my first beer, but Palmer's book helped make my second and third beers come out extremely well.<br /><br />Palmer's overview of the brewing process was presented in a straightforward and engaging manner, with useful information about how and why to perform each step.  I found that he added just the right level of more advanced info as well, particularly as I worked on the next couple of beers, I went back to the book several times to recheck what to do in each step, particularly with bottling and racking.<br /><br />Now I'm looking at trying some all-grain brewing (after 4 batches of extract and partial mashing) and going back to Palmer again for info on how to start mashing and sparging.  I think this is a book I'll use again and again, and would definately recommend it.
B000H0MKOC|4.0|Thank You For Not Smoking is one damn sharp movie!  This movie ends before it starts, its one of those where you want to rewind it in the middle of watching just to make sure that you didn't miss any thing.  Yes, it's just that blunt.  If Aaron Eckard who plays big tobacco lobbyist does not condition you to think differently about smoking or some thing other conversational topic then maybe you need to watch this movie again.  The body of the message of this film portrays is not that you should pick up smoking, that is it right and that you should go out and buy your child a pack on their 18th birthday.  But rather this movie's real message is about challenging the viewer to think for himself or herself.  Amen!  A film that makes people to think for themselves in the world of movies where you walkout dumber than you go in and then you wonder, why did I just pay for that?<br /><br />Naylor's job is to get himself caught in the middle of the controversy of smoking in America.  His message is that people should think for themselves and that big tobacco needs customers, so it to their benefit of people who have cancer to continue to smoke and if they die it would be a loss for the smoking industry.  Naylor's personal and professional life are one in the same, as he is convinced himself that when you on the right side of the argument you can never be wrong.  And even if you have to change your argument half way through it you can always be right, even when right is all negotiable.<br /><br />For all the films produced today that believe their causes are to inform and pump information into your head, fact or fiction, Thank You For Not Smoking ask you the question of whether or not thinking that way is correct, and if so, why?  It moves very fast and will not be film that you decide to turn off half way through, includes many bonus features and gives you a real life view of how this movie was produced and what was the inspiration of making such a movie.
B000002JSJ|4.0|...and what a big hill it is.<br /><br />Think. Circa 1975. Led Zeppelin release Physical Graffiti, their most experimental and ambitious album to date.<br /><br />Amazing how long, in actuality, a year is, huh? Robert Plant is mightily injured in a near-fatal car-crash. He records the album with a broken leg. And it sounds like it. Is it a sub-par performance? Surely not. But Plant sounds like he lost that high-pitched wail to his voice. It sounds gruffier, so to speak. It's like he aged ten years in the timespan of one.<br /><br />Jimmy Page's soloing is rather bogged down, becoming lost in the mix of the noise. His production, become rawer by the moment, sounds rather dull. Think back to Led Zeppelin II. The album was punctuated by high-pitched, electric guitar solos. While there is still soloing present, it would seem that Zep are going for a more heavy-blues soundscape here.<br /><br />And the album gets four stars. Why? Just because it's Led Zeppelin? My friend once told me that I would buy a record of Jimmy Page defecating onto a wall just because it says \\"Led Zeppelin\\" on it. Well, that may be so, but you can't pretend that the sheer musicianship isn't there. And at only seven songs, it's hard for there to be flops per se, if you get what I mean.<br /><br />1.Achilles Last Stand- Most likely the standout here. Riding on Robert Plant's \\"Immigrant Song\\"-esque mysticism to a much higher degree, it goes by on Page's brutal time changes and metal riffings. While a tad overlong (it goes beyond the ten minute mark), it nonetheless shows that Zep can still flat out PLAY.<br /><br />2.For Your Life- A great track from beginning to end. It opens on a melodic Van Halen-esque riff, leading into Plant's scruffy verse performance, then seguing into a melodious instrumental break. First time I heard a drug reference come out so blatantly in a Zep song.<br /><br />3.Royal Orleans- It's not bad, just seems uninspired. To the playing on all four sides of the spectrum. Nothing to write home about, though it fits with the \\"raw\\" sound of Swan Song's production.<br /><br />4.Nobody's Fault But Mine- Here is the most famous song on the album. I think I hear some Hendrix, some AC/DC, and some sub-Sabbath in the mix. Or do I? No, I hear Led Zeppelin. And what a marvelous thing to hear it is.<br /><br />5.Candy Store Rock- Total flop. Ouch. That burned. Plant isn't exactly Elvis, and if you couldn't distinguish between the two before, surely now you can. This just seems trite and thrown-in.<br /><br />6.Hots On for Nowhere- A very good upbeat, poppy tune. Actually, extremely good. It's cheesy on purpose, so to speak. And the guitar work, not to mention the chorus, is great.<br /><br />7.Tea for One- The \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" of the album. Starts off interestingly enough, with a cool opening riff, then settles down to a slow-burner. Good for those \\"in the moment\\" moments, if you catch my drift. Sorry, I'm only sixteen. Maybe too young for innuendo.<br /><br />There are four great songs, one good song, and two bad songs on this album. So, totaled in a percentage, it's a great ratio. But an album is about the SPRAWL. And this album just doesn't work like its predecessors. But it still warrants four stars, just barely. One star for the cool black \\"artifact\\" in the booklet. Buy to understand.pectrum.

B00028HBKM|1.0|I needed strong drink to wash my mouth out after sitting through POTC, the most distasteful film I've ever seen.  The only benefit from watching it was the sense of duty to warn others off. Like incinerating an insect under a magnifying glass, Gibson accentuates a few verses in the story of the last week of Jesus into a gruesome, disgusting, gratuitous gorefest.  Maybe it helps one's appreciation to believe that Jesus died for our sins (which I don't), but even in that case, I don't think that Gibson's relentless portrayal of violence adds much to the magic.
B000AM4PBS|5.0|I was a fan of Friends from the start but who can catch every show or remember to record all that you miss.  So the pleasure of re-living this remarkable viewing experience makes the purchase of this total package a bargain.  You can only sit back and wonder whether the writers, the actors or the producers and director did the best of three great jobs.  Each of these six characters will remain well placed in the SitCom Hall of Fame for all time.  And you can also finally decide which seasons you really like best.
1591840562|5.0|This book is like a bible to me in some ways. Not only do the strategies work but he speaks on a tactical level. Most books of this type start at 30,000ft and never leave there. Good if you've started many companies but bad if not. Guy can manage to change altitudes at the right moment. There is also an interesting summary of the book at [...] that gives a fantastic review and overview of the entire book. Highly recommend to anyone, starting anything, anywhere.

B000G759LW|5.0|I have never bought a Christina Aguilera album before, this is my first (I am 40). I LOVE IT! Mostly mellow groovy tracks (not sleepy) with a few danceable numbers sprinkled in. It has more substance than I expected. I thought it would be all raunchy pop but Christina surprised me. (However, I would NOT recommend this to preteens as she does get a little \\"nasty\\" - and the photos inside the CD will delight any young boy!) My 9 yr old girl is full of questions if we listen to it in the car, so I try to listen alone ... \\"Mom, what does she mean by \\"still got that freak in me?\\" Anyway, I highly recommend it to teens and \\"cool moms\\"!
B0000AQS0F|3.0|We watched Serenity, the movie and absolutely loved it.  Then we searched and found the entire series and bought it immediately.  Half of the episodes we love!!!  For those, it was worth the price.  The other half were quite disappointing.  The train robbery episode was so AWESOME!!!!!
B00000AOUD|5.0|This is my all-time favorite CD and I'm not alone.  Many people are shocked to find out this album rose to #1 on the Billboard charts when it was released in 1972.   <br /> <br />Still, I have a hard time recommending it to everyone and I fully expect some people will be very disappointed.  If you hate classical music or music that aspires to be more than just catchy pop, you probably are not going to like Thick as a Brick.  My sister-in-law hates it with a passion, saying it sounds like \\"a soundtrack for The Hobbit.\\"    To appreciate this album, I would say it's imperative that you have a taste for the offbeat, appreciate musical variety and occasional eccentricity.  The musical styles and tempos differ throughout the one song on this album and borrow from folk and rock music, maybe classical and maybe even nursery rhymes.  The album features organ, flute and drum solos, which make it dated almost by definition.  If you check out the Wilson and Alroy music review website, you'll see the reviewer couldn't even stand the thought of listening to it a second time.   <br /> <br />All that being said, if these things don't scare you off, and you're willing to take the plunge and give it a few listens, I think you'll find the commitment highly rewarding.  If you're a prog rock or Jethro Tull fan already, I can almost guarantee you'll be thrilled. <br />
B0000029GA|5.0|Illmatic has the best lyrics, beats,and production all wrapped up together out of any hip hop album. If you truly love hip hop you must have this cd. There are a few of 5 out of 5 albums, but this would be the only worthy of a 6 out of 5. I don't know if \\"Me Against the World\\" is better than Illmatic, but everyone is entitled to an opinion.  If you like this cd you should also check out Artifacts \\"Thats Them\\" because that is another one of the best and most overlooked hip hop albums of all time. Peace
B000FQ4M58|5.0|I was a bit afraid to buy this album after Rolling Stone gave it only two stars.  But I'm listening to it now, and it's a classic.  Well recorded, theatric music that we've come to expect from Meat Loaf.  It gets better with every listening.  Fans will love it.

B000G75AE8|4.0|I grew up listening to Slayer.  There were other thrash metal bands like Metallica and Anthrax.  There were other speed and death metal bands (too many to even thinkabout).  And then there was Slayer.  They did it like no other band did it.  Slayer was a music genre in of itself.  There was no comparison, equal, or counterpart.   <br /> <br />They broke through with Reign in Blood.  But they really hit their stride on South of Heaven and peaked on Seasons in the Abyss.  This CD takes you back to the pre-Reign in Blood days when all that mattered was speed. So that makes it refreshing.  Lyrics are thought provoking, mainly social commentary, not too much blood-and-guts and Satan worship (but it is there...hey, this is Slayer we're talking about!).  It's great that they have Dave Lombardo back on drums.  He makes all the difference.  This CD is a pleasant surprise for true Slayer fans because it is a good solid effort.  Look at their picture in the liner notes...dude, are they old or what?!?!  But boy, can they still play!  If you are a real Slayer fan, I would recommend this CD. It'll take you back to your youth.   <br /> <br />If you are not a Slayer fan, this is not the CD for you.  If you want to experiment with Slayer, start with South of Heaven and then get Seasons in the Abyss.  If you can, burn both of those CDs onto one disc and listen without stopping.  That's an awesome musical experience.  After you get used to that, then dig back to Reign in Blood and Hell Awaits. if you have warmed up to them by then, then you get Show No Mercy and this CD.   <br /> <br />After Seasons in the Abyss, I gave up them because Lombardo left the band and it just wasn't the same for me.  I never really got into the later CDs because I was a Dave Lombardo fan.  His return has renewed my faith in their abilities.  Solid CD.  4 stars.  Thumbs up.  Die-hard Slayer fans will dig it completely.  Dude, they're Slayer. They still rule.
B000HCO83Q|1.0|The writers of this movie wrote inspector gadget. Why did they think that they could write an xmen movie? the tacky third-grade level script was just a joke to me. The directing was just a mess, and the fact that the whole war was in an hour and a half movie, was just just disappointing. Angel was useless and just retarded, Juggernaut was just stupid, and everything in the movie was wrong. There is not one good thing i can say about this movie except for the acting. But i guess its easy to act like an idiot since thats all it looked like they had to do.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|Megadeth have always been a bit of a hit and miss affair. Their debut album didn't set my world alight, yet the follow-up \\"Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?\\" is a fantastic album. But then they followed that release with the rather average \\"So Far, So Good...So What?\\" which mixed some classic Megadeth tracks with some very ordinary material. I recall not knowing what the band was going to do next and fearing that they might be a one-album-wonder. How wrong I was! <br /> <br />\\"Rust in Peace\\" is without a doubt the bands best album. It mixes all the best Megadeth ingredients to create not only their ultimate release, but one of the finest examples that thrash metal has to offer. The line-up could have something to do with it, since this is the first album to include Marty Friedman's amazing guitar heroics. He combines perfectly with Dave Mustaine's already exceptional talent and together they produce a drool-worthy shredding partnership. Mustaine's vocals are also far superior to any of his previous work, finding the exact sound that his fairly limited range suits perfectly. But it's the song-writing that makes \\"Rust in Peace\\" the classic it is. Shredding riff after shredding riff, blistering memorable solos, catchy lyrics in the genre they work best (science fiction mixed with political disapproval) and a devastating way of building up each track to a climax. <br /> <br />While the first two tracks, \\"Holy Wars...The Punishment Due\\" and \\"Hangar 18\\", are both undeniably awesome, it's \\"Five Magics\\" that really rocks my world. Its atmospheric beginning holding the listener in its grip, preparing you for the incredible onslaught of thrash that is to come. The solos on this track are astounding and display just how important a role they can have when done well. Crank this baby up in volume and you'll be banging your head and raising the devil's horns in worship in no time! <br /> <br />As much as I adore \\"Rust in Peace\\", there are a few minor flaws that need mentioning andin my opinion drop it slightly below other thrash masterpieces such as \\"Reign in Blood\\" and \\"Master of Puppets\\". Firstly, the production isn't all that it could be. It doesn't quite have the crunch it deserves and the rhythm guitars are slightly tinny. But at least the clarity of each instrument is crystal clear, so I can't complain too much. Also, not every track on the album is of the almost impossibly high standard of the above mentioned classics. There are certainly no fillers on the album though and I'm extremely happy to announce that Megadeth decided not to include any unsuitable cover songs as they had on all prior releases. I firmly believe each of the three covers they'd done to this point (with maybe \\"These Boots\\" being an exception) completely ruined the momentum of the albums they were included on and ended up being the worst tracks. <br /> <br />All in all, \\"Rust in Peace\\" is an important part of metal's history and should be part of any metal fans collection. It's Megadeth's most consistently excellent album and stands up extremely well after over 15 years.
B00005R2IS|4.0|Anyone intelligent enough to \\"get\\" this movie is capable of understanding the Austrailian version. We have moved beyond the need for Americanizing films, which tend to water-down the original intent and flavor of the director/creators vision. This movie, for me, is more relevent today than it was when it was filmed. In this part of America, especially in small town rural areas, you can almost get the feeling that we are living in this future. Many people in the midwest scrounge and save their meager earnings to be able to afford to fill their gas tanks just so they can drive to their jobsite. The desolation of the area in which the movie was filmed makes this movie eerily believable and I often am reminded of the look and feel of the film when driving through some small midwest American \\"ghost-towns\\". In spite of the realism this motion picture is still high escapism, which for me is the point of watching movies. I'll watch this one over and over.

Crank this baby up in volume and you'll be banging your head and raising the devil's horns in worship in no time!  <br /> <br />As much as I adore \\"Rust in Peace\\", there are a few minor flaws that need mentioning and in my opinion drop it slightly below other thrash masterpieces such as \\"Reign in Blood\\" and \\"Master of Puppets\\". Firstly, the production isn't all that it could be. It doesn't quite have the crunch it deserves and the rhythm guitars are slightly tinny. But at least the clarity of each instrument is crystal clear, so I can't complain too much. Also, not every track on the album is of the almost impossibly high standard of the above mentioned classics. There are certainly no fillers on the album though and I'm extremely happy to announce that Megadeth decided not to include any unsuitable cover songs as they had on all prior releases. I firmly believe each of the three covers they'd done to this point (with maybe \\"These Boots\\" being an exception) completely ruined the momentum of the albums they were included on and ended up being the worst tracks.  <br /> <br />All in all, \\"Rust in Peace\\" is an important part of metal's history and should be part of any metal fans collection. It's Megadeth's most consistently excellent album and stands up extremely well after over 15 years.
0790729342|5.0|High adventure, interesting if not maybe somewhat predictable plot, and Mel's great and humourus acting style made this the best of the post nuclear war motion pictures which was the trend in the '80's. These movies were very relevent at the time because as a recent high school graduate, nuclear war was something we all felt could be our future to face. This story picks up after the \\"almost tomorrow\\" storyline of Mad Max. It is not essential to view Mad Max before seeing this feature as I didn't even know of it's exsistence at the time of my first viewing. But you shouldn't cheat yourself because the three mad max films make for a great escapist trilogy. Other than a few outdated 80's hairstyles, this film holds up extremely well. I would prefer they reissue this dvd with a remastered deluxe version as they did with the first film, but from my understanding the American version is owned by a different studio which which makes it a property rights issue. Although this is my favorite of the max movies, I would have to rank them from the first film being the best cinemaphotographly to the last film Beyond Thunderdome as the weakest of the lot. But you should see them all.
0739326740|1.0|Dan Brown had big ambition to do the impossible: to rewrite history - to rewrite everything about Jesus and Christianity ever recorded in the last 2000 years. And he is not even a historian yet he tried hard to pretend to be one. In an interview with ABC News Special aired on November 3, 2003, he even made such a rediculous cliam when he said if he would rewrite a non-fiction about Jesus, he would not change anything which he has already written in the Da Vinci Code. I could hear his voice was shaking and see him sweating. At that time, Dan Brown would definately fail a lie detector test.<br /><br />Mr. Brown has shown that he based his book on some hoax which have long been declared as pure lunatic fancination.<br /><br />By writing this book, he challenged the wisdom and intellgence of billions of people thru the history and declared that everyone else was wrong and only he was right. Does that sound familiar to you? But he is not even historian and the only interest he had in history is to make a name for himself and to make him rich. Is everyone else telling a lie while Dan Brown is the only person telling the truth? The last time I saw a person made a similar claim was in a psychiatric hospital during a visit.<br /><br />Dan Brown based his book on a supposedly secrete organization, Priory of Sion, and he claimed that the organization was in existance since 11 Century. But Priory of Sion was no secrete and it had nothing to do with protecting Jesus bloodline. It was a club in France only established in 1954 and its objective was no more than promoting low budget housing. Then a French fugitive Pierre Plantard used this club's name to claim that he was in the bloodline of Jesus and many French kings. He also faked a lot of documents. This Pierre Plantard who had criminal record and had been jailed earlier later admitted in court that he fabricated the whole scheme about the Pierre of Sion. Mr.Brown, I can see you sweating face, again.<br /><br />I am not suprised that someone like Brown would write a book to defame Jesus. A lot of people thru history have done that and even when Jesus still lived. But I was really suprised to see how easily people can be cheated. The majority of people seemed only too eager to accept any rubish to defame Jesus and Christianity, and they would never hear a thing when you tell them Dan Brown is NOT their hero and Da Vinci Code is based on pure hoax.<br /><br />The great French writer Hugo said that the entire English literature was based on one man's books, which is Shakespear's books, but the whole England was based on only one book: the Bible. When we have rid of all the treasure of the West which our democratic societies are based upon, we have nothing left but trash like Dan Brown's Code.<br /><br />Can we believe Dan Brown who declared that sexual intercourse with a group of people is a holy seremony for a supposedly Christian society, the Priory of Sion? Dogs would know better, Mr. Brown.<br /><br />I am also suprised why there is no Christian organizations to sue Dan Brown who based his book on the hoax and fabrication by the French criminal and fugitive Pierre Plantard when he declared that everything in his book is true to history?<br /><br />I do see the difference between Dan Brown and the French fugitive Pierre Plantard from whom he borrowed the concept of Priory of Sion: one of them made the desprate hoax and was sent to prison; the other became a great writer of our time. Who said that a small lie has a little impact, but a great lie has great impact?not suprised that someone like Brown would write a book to defame Jesus.

B000001ESF|5.0|Obviously, this is an all-time great album from perhaps the most technically sound Rock music trio to this date.  A sonic marvel something that could not have been technically produced 3 years earlier, and when available certainly could not be reproduced on the road. Combine the story telling aspect of those Neil Pert lyrics, along with  Geddy Lee's soaring vocals, and you have the making of some really impressive music! Greatness!
B00005B1W5|5.0|One of the best production so far. It does not get old even after several viewing.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|What a wonderful movie!  As I first started watching it, however, I felt that some of the scenes were not necessary.  I kept thinking, \\"Why are they showing some of this stuff?\\"  However, as the movie progressed, I realized that I was not meant to understand these scenes until later in the movie.  I agree with one of the other reviewers...you have to watch this movie with your heart, not with your mind.  After I watched it the first time, I kept going over the whole time thing in my mind.  In the end, after watching it a second time, I realized it is just a heartwarming story...that love can be found just about anywhere.  It's about finding someone who understands you and moves you.  Great job!!
B000053VAF|1.0|I think Jonathan Rosenbaum, film critic for the Chicago Reader, said it the best.  This is a film about spirituality aimed at 11 year olds.  I found the film extraordinarily simplistic, boring, and obnoxious.  The charcters are really annoying, and the performances are quite bad (with Jason Lee coming across the worst as a devil like dude).  Affleck and Damon's characters end up being another variation on the know it all, smug, Gen X type who thinks he has all the answers, and enjoys pointing out everyone else's faults.  This was supposed to be Smith's \\"profound\\" film, but he's way out of his depth here.  Gen X filmmakers like Smith are not known for tackling big subjects, and when Kevin tries to tackle the heavy questions of existence here, he fails miserably.  Even though the film is a comedy, it still fails to really get into anything worthwhile.  It comes across as \\"existence for dummies\\".  Smith's previous film, Chasing Amy (his best in my opinion), is actually more profound than this film is.  It's an overly silly movie about religion.  I was just offended by the bad acting and filmmaking, not by the so-called \\"blasphemy\\" of the film.  The Catholic Church who protested this film were fools for doing so.  There's nothing worth bothering about here.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I didn't see this in the theater.  My 18 month old & my 3 year old are not ready for the big screen yet.  But we did buy it the day it came out.  We are watching it now and it is quite enjoyable.  So far the only fault I have with it is there is no Fast Play.  With my kids, fast play is essential.  So just know when you buy it, you'll have to manualy press play.
B00082IJ08|5.0|I'll be listening to this album for years to come. It's timeless and definitely in my top twenty. Every song in the album is different, but all have a common sound that makes the album very cohesive. <br />Even if you've listened to it and didn't like it, I recommend listening to it at least three more times. It took a few listens for the whole album to grow on me, but now I love every single track (I don't skip ANY when I listen to it). The album is simply genius and I will be listening to it for years to come.
0142004235|5.0|This book is amazing. I never tire of the plot or characters, but while the story is extremely enjoyable, it is the compelling characters that Steinbeck created that truly give the book its merit.  <br />   As the excerpts on the book covers suggest, East of Eden is a loose epic retelling of the Biblical stories of Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel. Set in the Salinas Valley in the early 20th century, the novel involves the Trasks and the Hamiltons, telling of three generations of these families. The introduction to East of Eden is, while not as intriguing and momentous as the rest of the book, still successful in drawing in the reader. It is easy to understand both the story and the characters because of Steinbeck's simply composed sentences, though the characters introduced in the beginning have less depth than later characters. Because Steinbeck weaves over three separate stories in one novel, his plot may seem disarrayed and confusing at times. Ultimately, however, this contributes to the wonderful reading experience, as the reader is able to experience multiple stories involving contrasting characters and different paces. The book never gets sluggish or monotonous, because of the overlapping plotlines.   <br />   East of Eden is such an incredible book because the depth of the characters causes the reader to feel a wide array of emotions. Cal, for instance, is possibly the most appealing and intriguing character in the entire novel, despite Steinbeck's continual assertion that nobody likes the dark, secretive boy. Everyone can relate to Cal and his struggle to overcome the evil quality inside himself, and emerge \\"good\\" like his twin brother Aron. Everyone can understand Cal's desire to be accepted, his desire to be loved and appreciated. Everyone knows what Cal is going through when he tries to vindicate himself by trying to get revenge on those who favor his brother. He is jealous and he is vengeful, but he is also loving and sensitive. Cal's complexity makesthe second half of the novel so wonderful to read- his progress from a dark little boy to a mature, caring young man is amazing. Steinbeck's characterization is excellent, but he also writes scenes in which Cal and Aron are simply innocent, curious boys, rather than profound, universal characters part of an epic tale. East of Eden is so easy to relate to, but it is also a fantastic ambitious saga. <br />  One of the most common criticisms of the book is that the main antagonist, Cathy, is an unrealistic one-dimensional character, but she is, in fact, a complex character, as she embodies several types of evil, rather than just cruelty or insanity. She is written very sophisticatedly; if her severe lack of humanity and warmth seems unrealistic, it is because, in comparison with the other characters, Cathy is blatantly evil. There is no other character as depraved as Cathy in the story; even Charles desires love and displays fondness for his Adam, and Cal ultimately chooses goodness. Besides, Cathy does show brief episodes of weakness, which obviously show that she is somewhat human and not just an antagonist who opposes the protagonists and then suddenly disappears. The book begins to move at a faster pace when she is introduced, and as her mind disintegrates, the reader is left to wonder what her true level of humanity is, and whether she should be pitied. Cathy is one of the most fascinating characters in the book, because the nature of her wickedness is so intense that it easily heightens the suspense of the story.  <br />   Though I only touched on the more prominent aspects of East of Eden, the entire book is worth reading multiple times. Every single character is unique, realistic, and wonderful in some way. The plot is extensive, but there are so many different facets to explore, especially because Steinbeck elaborates on universal themes such as light versus dark, good versus evil, jealousy versus love. It is not be the simple plot that gives this book its wonderful quality, but the actual experience of reading through the history of the families and experiencing the multiple feelings this book incites that will make you fall in love with it.

B000003TAW|5.0|This is the second greatest album of all time.  (Right behind Pinkerton.)  The best part about it is that when they were in the studio, they were so nervous because they thought they sucked, that when it was finished, it was such a simple, solid rock album.  Yet the more you listen to it, learning every note of every song, you realize the genius intricacies to guitar, bass, and vocal melodies.  To the song arrangements, build-ups, and breaks.   <br /> <br />In a word, Perfect.
B0001ENY6M|3.0|While the film was beautiful to look at I'm not so certain of the accuracy of the historical take made by the movie. Debney did a good job with this score, which is mostly sound design in nature. However, Peter Gabriel's \\"Passion\\" has already tread this territory some 15 years earlier and with greater tone and sheer imagination. There can be no doubt that Debney listened to, studied, and in some cases excised ideas straight from that wonderful album. I appreciate that Debney used more orchestral elements to beef up the sonic state of this score, but this feels like he took elements from the sample libraries \\"Ra\\" and \\"Stormdrums\\" and added a few personal touches here and there and called it a day. There is nothing particularly unique here that Lisa Gerrard, Dead Can Dance, and Gabriel have not already done.  <br /> <br />This should not stop anyone who wants to listen to this score from doing so. It correctly evokes a mood and conveys the place and time that this story was set, so I cannot fault Debney.

B00005QZWI|5.0|Having made an earlier mistake of buying 2 C.D.'s which were not original soundtrack, I can truthfully say these are the best.  If you are a Lord of the Rings fan, look no further - no one does it better than The London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by the composer Howard Shore.  You will be back in Middle Earth reliving all those wonderful scenes.  I bought only The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King from Amazon.com because I already had the Two Towers from Amazon.co.uk and I would recommend all three - magical.
B000GIWS7E|3.0|Dream Theater is arguably the most brilliant and talented band of our time.  Their concerts are awe-inspiring, and their DVD offerings have been fantastic, so I had very high expectations for this 20th anniversary release, especially after reading the glowing customer reviews.  There were really two fatal flaws to this DVD.<br /><br />#1 - While all the instruments and vocals are crystal clear, for some reason, John Petrucci's guitar sounds like it was miked from the back of the theater and it's barely audible throughout the entire concert - even during his solos and intros (such as About To Crash Reprise.)  That alone pretty much ruined the DVD.<br /><br />#2 - There aren't chapter breaks for each song, so you have to actually fast-forward to get to specific songs.  What were they thinking???<br /><br />On the plus side, James LaBrie's vocals were actually good (not the off-key caterwauling that marred their early shows.)  The band was, of course, tight and phenomenal, but the concert really showed how they've evolved from ultra-technical prog rock to more mainstream pop-rock.  It seems like every song in the last half of the DVD started off as a ballad.  Personally, I prefer to watch their older, more technical performances, but I can't fault the maturation of their songwriting.  Still, I'd recommend Scenes From A Memory over this DVD any day.
0743289412|3.0|I hate to disparage, because I love most of what SK has written.  However, this book very strongly reminded me of a combination of two of King's other books:  \\"Rose Madder,\\" and \\"The Dark Half.\\"  And sadly, those were two of his weaker works.
0618680004|5.0|Once again, Richard Dawkins, the celebrated author of the Selfish Gene, conveys his theories on evolution and religion with remarkable clarity. Employing a systematic review of all 'evidence' in favour of religion and the belief in a God, Dawkins analyses the weakness in supporting such preposterous beliefs and refutes them with impeccable and deadly precision. This book will go down as the literature that unifies atheists in search of veritable scientific truth and will aid those indoctrinated by religion to realise the imposed delusion which imprisons their mind. It will be a difficult feat to genuinely remain a deist after digesting the information contained in this chef-d'oeuvre.
0553577123|4.0|This book is a wonderful account of life in the attic as told by Anne Frank.

B000FQ4M58|3.0|compared to Bat I , this is mediocre.  But buy it just for \\"Bad For Good\\"
B000AMWIVM|5.0|The best psychological thriller I have seen, this movie will leave you in shock by the end. Smart and cleverly written by Aussie's Leigh Wannell and James Wan, and directed by the latter, this movie breaks down all the boundaries of on screen violence. Starring Wannell himself, his character Adam wakes in a bathtub in a room with no lights. He calls out for help and hears a strangers voice, the lights come on revealing the two chained and shackled in a grimy, abandoned, windowless industrial bathroom. And so the game begins... The two prisoners are victims of serial killer Jigsaw, well he really isn't a serial killer as we find out. He puts his victims through a dangerous game to test their will to live, and its up to the victim if they live of die.<br /><br />This movie is one hell of a rollercoaster ride which will appeal to fans of both horror and psychological thrillers. It was voted one of the most scary films of all time, and while I didn't find it too scary, its the reality that these crimes could happen to anyone that is most frightening.<br /><br />Filmed in only 18 days, most of it filmed in a warehouse, this is quality filmaking by a young up-and-comer. Many studios knocked this back which they surely must regret as it went on to gross over 55 million dollars.<br /><br />Buy it if you liked Seven, Kiss The Girls, The Bone Collector and Red Dragon.
B000002IM7|5.0|Kerrang Magazine raved about this new \\"New age Metal\\" band from Houston and that is what grabbed my attention. I looked at the cover of the album  and the sight of Doug Pinnock with his Mohawk hairdo and Calvary jacket and Jerry Gaskill with his very 80's New Romantics hairstyle kinda made me think \\"What am I getting into here?\\". My thoughts were blown away immediately. For once, Kerrang got it right. I had been misled by many of their 'Next BIG thing' predictions, and Kings X shoulda been one of them. I saw Kings X many times on their travels in the U.K. including the Mini Thrash festival (I HATE THRASH)in Brixton with Suicidal Tendancies/M.O.D. (Or was it S.O.D.) and Anthrax. I was lucky enough to leave early and to meet Doug on the Tube on the way home and have a great chat. I also saw Kings X support ACDC at the Wembley Arena, but that was a bit of a mis-match too. The fans only came for the Headliners, and the Houston Trio were not given a hope in Hell. One of the greatest ever gigs I saw however was their debut at the Marquee Club in 1988 shortly after this release. What an amazing show and the response was even overwhelming for the Band. Another Marquee gig the following year in support of Gretchen... followed suit. Kings X toured the U.K. regularly to try and win acclaim, but sadly they remained as an underground Cultish band. Their 1st 4 CDs (OOTSP/Gretchen goes to Nebraska/Faith Hope Love and Kings X) are all highly recommended,but the debut overall is by far the strongest. Gretchen,however, was to prove the most popular. As other reviewers have pointed out, there is not a weak track on the CD, and the production from the so called '4th member' of the group, Sam Taylor, has a major part to play in the amazing quality of sound from this 3 piece. I have a demo of the Pre-Kings X band, Sneak Preview, and here we did get sneak previews of many of the tracks from the album with a raw feel. I probably would have given these guys a miss had this been the final result. The CD opens with the epic \\"In the new age\\". A very heavy slow number with crunching guitars which takes us into perhaps Kings X most memorable song \\"Goldilox\\". I was at a gig of theirs from around 1999 in Camden where Doug didnt sing a note. The audience did it for him. Very emotional indeed. \\"Power of Love\\" is one of my personal favourites with its gentle opening riffs which explodes into pure hard rock heaven. The guitar work is very Powerful here. \\"Wonder\\" follows suit. The main reason for the high praise of this album however is the wonderful vocal harmonies. \\"King\\", \\"Far far away\\" and \\"Shot of Love\\" for example are all Top class. \\"Visions\\" closes the album, and what a way to close. Another heavyish song that is most noted for its Headbanging and Thrashy element. Why did Kings X not achieve greater success? There are a couple of theories. Maybe it was the media coverage of their Christianity beliefs or just the fact that they were'nt Charasmatic enough or \\"Dangerous\\" like their competition at the time i.e. Guns n Roses for starters.They were very nice and humble guys who genuinely love the music. However, things changed in the latter stages of Kings X musical and spiritual life. \\"Ear Candy\\" was a huge risk, and the pyschedelic twist did'nt really help their cause. Albums like \\"Dogman\\" were heavied up big time. Recent Kings X releases like \\"Black Like Snake\\" and \\"Ogre Tones\\" cannot touch the feel of their earlier material, and it seems as though GOD is the one who got all the blame, as fans will witness from the \\"Ogre Tones\\" album. Basically, Kings X, I believe, peaked on this album. If this was their thid album, say, things could have been a whole lot better. As I said earlier, get this CD first, and take it from there.

B000IOM0YM|4.0|For the most part I like Rockology but the glaring omission is the Anaheim Stadium 1976 show. It isn't on any of the bonus discs either. The only thing I can figure is that Paul's microphone had an audio problem for the first two songs (they could hear him in the stadium but it didn't come across on video). Still, that was an awesome show from the Destroyer tour that should have been included in it's entirety. The Houston '77 show and the Detroit '76 show are too dark for some reason and there is only one song from the Paul Lynde Halloween Special. The Mike Douglas interview was cut short too... Except for the Easter eggs I'd already seen everything on here (on bootleg) except Acrobat '74 and the So It Goes interview from England in '76. I'm a Kiss diehard so I tend to notice what's missing instead of what's included. There are lots of fans who don't own bootleg tapes who haven't seen this stuff before so this is especially good for them. I think it's fantastic that they're finally releasing this stuff on DVD and I'm looking forward to Volumes II and III.

B000009EAD|5.0|This is hands down their best album with Matt Barlow. If you're checking out the band get this first then check out Stormrider and Glorious Burden. If that gets you hooked pick up Alive In Athens and so on until you have all of them.

B000FTWB7G|5.0|I love Fallen. A lot. When I first got it, I listened to nothing else for about a month and a half and I still love Fallen. However, The Open Door is awesome!!! 10 times better than Fallen. Amy's vocals have gotten a lot better, especially live. The songs are heartfelt and emotional. The songs are heavy, yet have a lot of piano, which I like. People who say they don't like the opera and piano aspect don't appreciate this genre of music and have obviously never heard...or just don't like Nightwish or Within Temptation or any bands like that. Not comparing Ev to them, just saying that this is what the cd has leaned toward yet Ev still remains in their own catagory. As for the songs, they're all amazing, but I prefer All That I'm Living For- The vocals are amazing and the lyrics are awesome and the guitars are awesome as well. Like You is a gorgeous ballad with a lot of emotion that actually made me cry. Lithium is heartbreakin and well done and Lacrymosa is one amazing song. Mozart plus Evanescence equals love. I highly recommend this cd to anyone who is open with their taste in music.
B000A3DFZE|4.0|I find this to be a very good album.  The first two songs are really wonderful, and Clapton also does a great cover of George Harrison's Love Come to Everyone.  The song Revolution is also among the best tracks here.  I really do not understand all those negative reviews. Must Clapton remain in a narrow musical niche and always give us the same as before?  Clapton wears his maturity well on this cd as this time he offers us something a little different from straighforward rock, reggae or blues. I've looked forward to playing it every day since I purchsed it. To each his own.

Following his earlier formula, there are tracks in English, Italian and Spanish, and although the lyrics may be in another language, this doesn't detract from the simple and timeless beauty of the music.<br /><br />First single \\"You Are Loved (Don't Give Up)\\" is one of the most inspiring tracks, with lyrics like \\"Don't give up / It's just the weight of the world / When you're heart's heavy / I...I will lift it for you\\", but the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me as far as I'm concerned is the amazing \\"February Song\\" where he accompanies himself on the piano.<br /><br />Another track to note is \\"So She Dances\\" and then there's \\"In Her Eyes\\", but one that'll stop you in your tracks is \\"Lullaby\\", written by Groban and Dave Matthews, and sung a cappella with Ladysmith Black Mambazo. If you liked Paul Simon's \\"Graceland\\", you'll love \\"Weeping\\", also with Ladysmith Black Mambazo, and what better way to close an album than a collaboration with Herbie Hancock.<br /><br />Third time's another charmer for Josh Groban.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, November 7, 2006
0743298020|2.0|I give it two stars for ambitiously bringing back a beloved genre, but that's all the praise I have for it. I was excited when I read about this book.  I bought it the minute I heard of it and then had to make myself wait for a long business trip (cross-country flight and a week alone in a hotel room) so I could savor it.  Well, three weeks AFTER my trip I finally finished it. (the book I read prior to it was longer and I read it in two nights) <br /> <br />I felt like I was slogging through mud everytime I read a few pages. Slow and plodding, not thrilling and spellbinding. Overly-descriptive in places that didn't matter.  Characters explained and observed and repeated themselves for many sentences when a couple would have gotten the idea across nicely.  And then, there were parts that were too vague.  Some things are best left to the imagination but why over-describe on one page then leave the reader to guess what is meant on the next?  Yes, most (but not all) of the vagueness was cleared up by the end but I just didn't care by then.  <br />
0618680004|5.0|This book is a frontal and devastating attack against religion. As Nobel Prize S. Weinberg said (quoted in this book): `Religion is an insult to human dignity.'    For Richard Dawkins, in view of Darwin's perfect theory of natural selection there is almost certainly no God. More, `God is a pernicious delusion.'  After burying the Christian arguments for the existence of God, he unmasks creationism's new logo `Intelligent Design' as filling illusory and temporarily scientific gaps with God. He exposes the profound Phariseism of the Christian Right (The American Taliban) as `stalwart defenders of human life, as long as it is embryonic.'  The use of Holy Scriptures as a source for absolute morality is truly amazing. The God of the Old Testament is guilty of genocides, while the New Testament imprints with hot iron `original sin' on every new born baby on this planet.  He agrees in no way with certain moralists that we need religion and God to force people to be and to do good. Here he quotes A. Einstein: 'If people are good only because they fear punishment, and hope for reward, then we are a sorry lot, indeed.'    However, his explanation of religion as an accidental by-product (a misfiring of something useful) is not very convincing. A way out of this problem could be found in the book `Promethean Fire' by C. Lumsden and E.O. Wilson and certainly Lewis Wolpert's 'Six Impossible Things Before Breakfast'.  He reveals also the immense power of religion, but doesn't stress enough its pernicious use by the powerful. As a matter of fact, religions fight each other, see the remarkable movie `The Immortal' by Mercedes Moncada Rodriguez, who reveals how Catholicism is attacked by American churches in Nicaragua, because Catholicism is considered too progressive.  Man's aspiration for immortality, already magisterially expressed in the `Epic of Gilgamesh', has been institutionalized and exploited by the religious and political rulers in their own favor. R. Dawkins rightly condemns the religious indoctrination of children and their use as lethal weapons (e.g., the madrasas in Pakistan to fight the soviet heathen). Also, religious fundamentalism is supported by the West, because nations whose educational system is based on learning Holy Scriptures by heart, can make no atom bombs.  The religious leaders in power know very well who their enemies are: the rationalists. As Luther said: `Reason should be destroyed in all Christians.' A lot of those leaders are not the true believers they seem to be. As Richard Dawkins rightly asks: `Why don't they blow up themselves?'   Pope Pius XII asked Teilhard de Chardin if and how long Catholicism could survive the scientific onslaught.    Concerning quantum mechanics, in the universe all waves collapse under the decoherence principle (see Brian Greene, The Fabric of the Cosmos), so the duality dead/alive cat is not an option.    This fascinating, `barking mad' book, written by a superb free mind, is a must read for all those concerned by the future of mankind.
B00003BDXG|2.0|This movie was as one of the most disappointing in its genre, far less interesting than Pulp Fiction and even below the level of Reservoir Dogs. It is said that in the violent late Middle Ages street shows were  often staged in European cities where fake blood flowed like water, heads fell off and stomachs erupted sausages to simulate intestines  during an evisceration delighting  the crowd. It seems that in the violent final decade of the twentieth century we had come  full circle from Barbara Tuchman's gripping account of the  awful fourteenth century.  Despite the abundant gore if the film had been  better handled it could have been quite good. There are  glimpses of its failed potential at different  points. For instance the scene  towards the end where the prison governor's head is impaled on a broomstick and carried around by the revolting inmates seems to be a direct  copy of an actual event at the  Bastille during the days of the early French revolution. In sum, as a special kind of disgusting  art form it is interesting, as entertainment though Natural Born Killers sucks. I admit some  people will like it , no doubt the same crowd who would attend  public executions if they were available for viewing.
B000HCO83Q|5.0|I did enjoyed this movie. It still delivered with all the themes of the X-men comic book. Basically, the plot of the movie is a very simple and direct one. When a medical company comes out with a cure that can supress the mutant gene peramently in mutants. It divides the mutant population. Some mutants want the cure, while others join up with Magneto to try and  stop the company from making it. While others team up with the X-men to try and help them stop Magneto. There's also a subplot to this film. When Jean Grey is found alive, the X-men discover that Jean Grey has become very powerful and dangerous to herself and to her teamates. The X-men are face with a tough decision, on how to stop her. All in all, this is a great movie. (However, I did find this movie hard to watch. Due to the fact, there was some graphic scenes. So, if you have children. I would advise that you don't let them watch this movie).
B00005JP87|5.0|This movie is wonderfully successful in enveloping you in turn of the century Vienna in a way that most other period movies only attempt. The spirit and atmosphere of the time are portrayed with seamless accuracy, due in some part to filming in the Czech Republic. The acting of each major character is superb, but Paul Giamatti's final scene with cascading revelations is reminiscent of Hitchcock. Ed Norton was perfectly cast as the brooding Illusionist. The illusions pay homage to Robert Houdin. A gem of a film...
B000J10ERO|1.0|After numerous script revisions and quite a few years, this is what makes it to the big screen? <br /> <br />No reason that the superhero genre can't deliver excellent plot along with terrific action: see Spider-Man films and Batman Begins.  That makes this movie even more of an horrendous mess. <br /> <br />It used to be fun to be Superman, but now the character is a brooding, obsessive voyeur whose longing glances at Lois Lane turn creepy almost immediately.  Having trashed the once-simmering love relationship, Singer then obliterates the fun workplace rivalry the two characters once shared.  Oops, Lois gets a Pulitzer Prize - game over, Clark! <br /> <br />Mindless and moping, this film depresses and confuses at every turn.  Take Lex Luther - who believes that people will want to pay to live on a Kryptonite island in the middle of the Atlantic!  Are you kidding me? <br /> <br />Finally, Superman has now been saddled with a kid.  And to top it all off, at some point in the future, we know Lois is going to dump a decent man whose only flaw is not being Superman. <br /> <br />Who wants to be Superman?  Definitely not me.  Thumbs way down.  Buy the Christopher Reeve movies.  Better yet, examine how animation displays more heart and character development than live action these days by picking up the Justice League series.
B000IOM0YM|3.0|I'll support what another reviewer wrote:  the sound is a big disappointment.  Maybe I was expecting too much, maybe I was spoiled by the Led Zeppeelin DVD that actually has great sound.  The sound on this DVD is not a step up from the bootlegs I have heard before.  The video looks better, some of the extras are very nice but if you are getting this just for a bump up in audio, keep watching your old bootlegs, this DVD is no improvement.
0767903862|5.0|Bill Bryson's adventures, as usual, are full of lovely descriptions, surprises, and laughs. I am in the process of reading all of his books - if you like this make sure you get more.
B00005OMTT|5.0|To say that Enigma is ecletic is not descriptive enough.  I purchased the CD for a few songs I knew I liked but ended up enjoying many of the other tracks as well.
1594200106|3.0|What an unusual book.<br /><br />I can't say it was unputdownable because it was. I found reading this novel slow going, yet also enjoyed the story each time I picked it up.<br /><br />I got confused with some of the characters, maybe because they had Spanish names and it took a while to get used to.<br /><br />Suddenly when I got to about page three hundred the book held my interest more and I was glad I read on to the end because the story within the story was a really good one...I just wished it could have maybe been simplified by a hundred pages.
0060536357|5.0|This is a great book if one is interested in learning more about the world of LBO's and the dealings of wall street. If you read Den of Thieves and liked that one you'll definitely love this one.
B000IOM0YM|3.0|I wondered why some people were bashing this title. while i dont agree %100 with them, they do have a point on some counts. The footage that has seen the light of day on offical videos over the years looks better than this dvd. Why? i dont know. Houston and Detroit are too dark. MSG is rubbish (i actually wanted the Largo concert but here in Australia you get whatever, i will get Largo though) i think my video copy is better than this MSG. Even the video clips arent as good as seen on Xtreme close up. if the vision was as good as i think we all expected, knowing how good we knew it could be, this dvd would, as i said be a 5 star dvd. <br />also, as has been said, the PLHS is incomplete, as is the other tv specials. The Cadilac High stuff is awesome though. <br />The crowd has been overdubed on all the concerts and sounds good because you can hardly hear them on the original tapes. gives them much more atmosphere. <br />so, if your newish to Kiss (say last 10 years or so) you'll love it. if your old and jaded like some of us who have been collecting for years (the very first bootleg tapes i seen was the 75 8mm stuff and could harly make out what i was watching and Aussie tour stuff) you'll be a little disapointed at what could of been. lets hope vol 2 and 3 are a little better.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|I wasn't expecting this film to be much of anything, but upon viewing I was blown away! Right up til' the end with the twist... WOW! I'd definitely give it 5 stars and see it again. Well acted, timed and scripted.... A great thriller in every sense of the word!
B000669GAI|4.0|Very good collection for those of you who haven't alreay bought the original CD's.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|Well I was a little sceptical after having been disappointed with a few of the loafs previous attempts but I have to say this album impressed me greatly.  Not since Bat out of Hell (1977) have I been able to sit through a whole album and despite a few cliche passages and dodgy high notes, I really do love this album.  For me it's the best he's done since Hell 1 and a number of the songs are reminiscent of this 1 with a definitive modern sound.  I think Steinman has added to his list of masterpieces.  It almost feels as though it's 1977 on steroids.  Personally I really enjoy it and think I will in years to come.  Of course having set the bar so high in the first place it was always going to be near impossible to get anywhere near the quality but finally for me he has done so.  Highlights for me are The Monster is Lose (hugely vibrant energetic song) Land of the Pigs, Alive (the best on the album) , If God could Talk.  If you love Hell 1, then I'm sure you'll love this.
0385336691|5.0|Wherever Jack Reacher goes trouble seems to follow.  He can't even have a quiet cup of coffee without a crime taking place in front of him. This is the 10th book in the Reacher series and they seem to be getting better and better.  Can't wait for the next one to come out.
B0001WTWCO|5.0|The English Patient  ranks right up there with Gone With the Wind but may even surpass that.  I could watch this movie every day and not get tired of it.  Such a great story line, and acting that is incredible.
B0001AP158|1.0|rocking Bob Jovi is great...accoustic Bon Jovi sucks
B000002H70|4.0|Released in 1989, this is The Cure's eighth album (depending on how you are counting).  It is 71 minutes long, and the sound quality is very good.  It is a bit muddled and indistinct at times, but it exentuates the texture of the music. <br /> <br />Tracks 7 through 11 are absolutely fantastic.  They create an atmosphere that is a little dreary and dark, but is still very interesting.  As far as setting a mood and the music flowing throughout, this is similar to Santana's Caravanserai.   <br /> <br />The only problem with the first 6 tracks, is that atmosphere and mood is disrupted by pop hooks being thrown in.  These are little bits of music you expect to hear on a pop record or maybe even an advertising jingle.  They really impact the full force of the music. <br /> <br />Unlike many goth, progressive or atmospheric albums, the song writing is very good.  There are deep and meaningful lyrics throughout. <br /> <br />If you are the type that likes \\"Friday I'm In Love\\", than you will probably enjoy the first 6 tracks more than the rest of the CD. <br /> <br />NOTE THAT SOME PEOPLE REALLY, REALLY LOVE THIS CD AND GET MAD IF YOU DON'T GIVE IT 5 STARS AND SAY IT IS THE BEST ALBUM OF ALL TIME.  THEY GET EVEN BY MARKING THE REVIEW AS NOT HELPFUL.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|Not as stellar as season 1 but many shows aren't. It is much more fluid when watching the DVDs then watching with big delays and reruns we had during the original tv airing.  You couldn't ask for a better cast with incredible chemistry and great dialogue.  The mystery wrap up is well done.
B000000OQF|5.0|I bought this album in the spring of 88' after it had been out for a while.  I never heard a single track from it prior to that.  I was enrolled in Columbia House's music club and read about this album.  I thought they had a cool name and a cool look (the review had a pic.) and I bought the cassette.  Damn, was I ever in for a treat. <br />I instantly loved Welcome To The Jungle, Nightrain and Out Ta'Get Me.  Everything else took within time. <br />I was dumbfounded when I saw them become the biggest band in the world (for a while anyway).  I was glad I recognized raw talent before most everyone else did (but they weren't far behind).  The discovery of this album earned me respect amongst my friends (for a few minutes).  They were awe struck by G.N'R.'s blend of classic and raw dirty L.A. rock at the time.  I just looked on like a proud parent watching \\"my boys\\" conquer the world. <br />They were once one of the biggest bands on the planet and this album proves why.  It's all killer and NO filler.  You could play any tune from it on the radio and most everyone could identify the band and also the album.  Not a bad track to be found here. <br />I'm sure some will come here reading up on this band wondering where to start as far as listening goes.  For those, I recommend this album. <br />There is not a weak cut to be found here.  Every strength the band ever displayed was here.  If you like this album then listen further to \\"GN'R Lies\\" and the \\"Use Your Illusion\\" albums.  They had more to offer.  This album is the logical starting point for anyone though.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Red Hot Chili Peppers - Stadium Arcadium (2006)<br /><br />And I would be extremely surprised if anything came along to top it at this point. I don't think I've ever heard a double album in which every song is at least good and nearly all of them are INCREDIBLE. This is quite possibly the crowning achievement of the RHCPs. Certainly the best songwriting they've ever done. Only BLOOD SUGAR SEX MAGIC can beat it if it's the FUNK you're after.<br /><br />Most people are pretty hip to this album already, so I won't gush endlessly about these songs. I'll just say that my favorite is probably \\"21rst Century\\" (at the moment at least). Flea's bass is incredible. It's just such an exciting song and makes me feel so good about living in the here and now. PEACE!
B000HBK3MM|4.0|I personally like the CD a lot.  Her voice is unique, stylish, and she makes it happen.  The hot tracks that need to be singles are 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 which is a pretty darn good number for a 11 track album.  And that doesn't mean the others are bad! I just like these the most.  They have a good pace and I can sing along is all.  Let's not forget to mention that's she is actually kinda hot and in a respectable way! Are there a lot of babes like this from the UK? hmmmmm...... Anyway, if you like some sit back chill type music with a nice melody here it is.  Get this album and support a rising star.
074327931X|5.0|Do not take the GMAT without reading this book, i.e if u want an 800 score
B00005JPBP|5.0|I was looking forward to seeing the movie very much and it did not disapoint. <br />The story is told in such a way that I would have thought would be confusing, yet I found myself keeping up fine, kudos to the writer and director. I look forward to seeing it a second time with all the knowledge I gained from the first viewing.
B00007G1ZC|5.0|This is one of if not the best movie ever. It's incredibly sweet, well done, and in many ways dream like. Kursasawa has a knack for making quality movies and this is no exception. It's not some clashing action thriller, nor is it a Baron Munchaussen, but it still is oddly enough very catchy.
B0000C8AV3|4.0|I like the Dylan songs where you have to work to unravel the meaning. You certainly have to do that with the songs on Infidels. This is Dylan's first secular record in five years (or maybe it's better tosay it's his first record in years that isn't overtly Christian).    The opening cut is Jokerman, and it is a mystical pop masterpiece, probably about Dylan himself. \\"Sweetheart Like You\\" is about meeting a beautiful woman in an unlikely place. It is lovely ballad, and it was recently featured in the movie \\"North Country.\\" \\"Neighborhood Bully\\" seems to be about the political unrest in the Middle East. The rocking blues tune \\"Man of Peace\\" is about how Satan comes to us in many disguises, though the disturbing last verse might be a reference to Christ, and if this is true, than it fits the idea that Dylan himself is one of the infidels on this album.    \\"I and I\\" uses a Rastafarian saying to describe the Jewish Dylan's coming out of Christianity into the light of Judaism. Yet if I'm interpreting the song correctly, Dylan credits a stranger (Christianity) for teaching him to \\"look into Justice's beautiful face (his  own Jewish tradition).    If you are a believing Christian, and you buy into these interpretations, you might find the album disturbing. Dylan has become an infidel to the Christian faith.    But if you like good musical art, this is one of Dylan's best efforts of the 1980s. I recommend it, and see if you agree with the way I interpret it.
055357342X|4.0|A Storm of Swords is the third book in the ongoing series titles A Song of Ice and Fire. The first book is A Game of Thrones and the second book is titled A Clash of Kings. This series is in no way connected to the Forgotten Realms or Dragonlance. A Song of Ice and Fire can be easily described as adult fantasy, there are elements in this series that you will be pressed to find in other fantasy series on the market today. If you are a fan of fantasy, you really need to give this series a chance.<br /><br />Martin has structured this book, in a way that is slightly different from most authors. Each chapter is a different point of view. Each chapter focuses on a different characters. The benefits of this are that you get to see multiple things going on, you are able to see a very large plot that slowly takes place, and you are able understand each of the characters in ways a traditional book would not allow you to do so. There are several character points of view in this book, and each chapter has a point and a purpose.<br /><br />This is truly a character driven book. A great plot is nothing without good characters. The characters in this book you will either love or you will hate - sometimes those feelings will change between chapters too. If you are looking for truly good characters, or truly evil characters, this may not be the series for you. However, much like the world we live in, the characters in this book look out for themselves and their families and their choices and actions are based on that. They make choices they regret, they make choices that get them in trouble, and they make choices that have ripple effects throughout many characters. Another thing about this book, is Martin does not become attached to his characters. If the death of a character would benefit the story then a character will die, regardless of how `important' that character is within the story. I wish more modern authors would understand that some characters need to die at times. You never truly know who is safe in these books, which makes it that much more real.<br /><br />The plot in this book is book is really several plots at once due to the multiple points of view throughout the book. I would like to list them all, but some would be spoilers and I wouldn't want to do that to you. There are some plots from the first two books that are continued on, such as the continued fight to who will be king. Some plots are resolved from the first two books as well, yet, just as quickly, new plots pop up. With all the talk of multiple plots and such, one might think they would get lost or confused. This is not the case. I don't think I was confused at any time as to what was going on, who was where, etc. It's a well written plot, but the reader needs to pay attention at the same time.<br /><br />This book, and series for that matter, is not your typical fantasy. The reader does need to pay attention and can't simply coast through reading. You need to be in the right frame of mind to tackle this story, but if you are and you give this series a shot you will not be disappointed. It's a fantastic read and one I would certainly recommend to most fantasy fans.<br /><br />I feel the need to say that I found the first half of this book a grind to get through. Not in the sense that it was bad writing, just that it took a long time for things to shape up. It was a plodding plot and characters for awhile. However, once the actions starts, about the last third of the book, it really picks up and flies past. There are a great deal of fantasy elements in this book, but as of right now most are rather subdued. While they are present they have yet to become in your face type elements that are common in Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance etc. This is not a bad thing, it just depends on what you are looking for in a book.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this book a little less than the first book in the series. Mainly due to the slowness of the first half of the book. Yet, I didenjoy it quite a bit. As with the first book I can see most fantasy fans really enjoying this book. This is adult fantasy and as such has sex and violence in it. It does not throw it in the reader's face though, it just happens and fits in with the book. I would highly recommend this series to anyone looking for some epic fantasy.. Yet, I did enjoy it quite a bit. As with the first book I can see most fantasy fans really enjoying this book.

B000002BSG|4.0|I'm not really a fan of Jamiroquai, not that I don't like their music before or after this album, this is just the first album of their I've listened to. The very first song from Jamiroquai that I've ever heard was the single for this album Virtual Insanity. To me it is a song with a smooth sound that should catch everyone's ear. After the second track the rest of the album was unpredictable for me because Virtual Insanity sets a certain sound that most artists would stick with. Every song on this album has its own distinct sound and feeling to it, that's my favorite thing about this album that it has the ability to give something different with every song. You get a couple of really beautiful slow songs that could melt metal and though the lyrics are lacking \\"Spend a life time\\" the music picks it up. You've got songs that you can chill to and are really the definition for a perfect chill song. For people that don't know much about Jamiroquai like myself I think Traveling without moving is the album to start with because it is sure to get you hooked.
0316172324|3.0|I was assigned this book for a graduate diversity course and was initially excited. In fact, it was on my must read list. With an open mind, I began reading. However, I struggled to finish this book and became increasingly troubled. Why? From a diversity framework, I agree that we do \\"blink\\" however, we should do so based on educated, seasoned experiences which could help us think/decide with fewer personal biases, prejudices, and negative encounters. Honestly, most people live very busy, complicated lives and most don't have the opportunity/time to think and decide from this conceptual base. In addition, the theorists quoted seemed to brush aside or negate the value of thinking based on popular and accepted theories in sciences, math, philosophy, and anthropology. From a business and political perspective, I wondered if \\"blinking\\" was the methodology used by Bush administration officials--thinking (deciding} w/out rational analysis/reasoning rooted in sound, reliable, tested and re-tested data? I think this book encourages some to rush to judgement--to think without thinking.    <br /> <br />Overall, I do appreciate having read it and respond in an academic community full of opportunities for a robust debate. But, I am troubled   because I can see evidences of blink being used and causing harmful outcomes.
B000I5X81A|3.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this collaborative CD, but it turns out to be a lot less than what it could've been.  I think that neither Clapton nor Cale would be quite who they are today without the other guy, so the links between their careers should have meant a fascinating and enjoyable pairing.  But Road to Escondido isn't as good as past Clapton duet albums (the BB King thing was better), and it's not even 2006's best duo CD within this genre (I liked the Knopfler-Harris CD more).  The problem is that the songs are just so lifeless for the most part.  The lone exceptions are \\"Dead End Road,\\" \\"Anyway the Wind Blows,\\" and maybe one or two others.  Otherwise the songs are just slow, shuffling blandness.  (I guess one other exception might be one good slow song, \\"Three Little Girls.\\")  I guess I shouldn't be completely surprised by the laidback nature of this music, since Mr. Cale's output over the past two decades has been like this.  It's just that the Clapton-King CD was so full of vitality, I just didn't expect this new album to be DOA.  It becomes a self-parody at times, as on the lyrics to \\"Hard to Thrill\\" - \\"...nothing really moves me anymore.\\"  Or on \\"Last Will & Testament,\\" when the guys sing \\"I'm older than most... It won't be long now before I'm a ghost.\\"  By the way, the singing is part of the problem -- the two men sing way too often in unison, when it would be much better if they alternated singing verses and then only joined up on the choruses.  Singing together, they just sound like too old guys mumbling along.  Saying the whole thing is lackluster would be a major understatement.  Getting old doesn't have to sap the life from you musically.  Just listen to the Noo Hoo CD, Endless Wire, which is as vital and vigorous as anything Pete & Roger have made in three decades (and much better than this Road).
0875847706|4.0|This is more of a philosophical book and its aim is to expose a framework of assumptions that many of us hold - assumptions that hold us down in the world of 'way things are', instead of allowing us to live in a 'world of possibilities'. Counterintuitive at times, the advice is very helpful once you wrap your head around it:<br /><br />- Identify your assumptions<br /><br />- Give yourself, and your peers an 'A'<br /><br />- Don't take yourself so seriously<br /><br />- Make mistakes, think in possibilities, avoid downward spirals<br /><br />- Live your vision, and more...<br /><br />It's an excellent book, well written and with great stories. Chances are, you'll come back to it more than once, just as I have. If you like it, take a look at the Purple Cow by Seth Godin, they complement each other really well and can make a great gift!

B00000JPH6|4.0|It has been a thousand years since the Dark Crystal was broken.  The break caused the creation of the cruel Skeksis and the peaceful Mystics.  A young Gelfling whose family was killed by the Skeksis has been raised by the Mystics.  Now he learns that he has a destiny.  He is to retrieve the missing shard of the Crystal and heal it.  If he doesn't, then darkness will rule forever.  It is because of this prophesy that the Skeksis destroyed his people.  If there are no Gelflings then no Gelfling can end their power. <br /> <br />So begins a journey for the young Gelfling.  He must visit a seer, avoid capture, reach the citadel of the Crystal, and figure out how to heal it.  Along the way he discovers a female Gelfling and the two continue his journey togther.  As the time of the prophesy draws near the Mystics also journey to the Citadel.  For when the three suns come together the Crystal must be healed.  Strange creatures and fantastic vistas await.  Will the Gelfling succeed and bring peace to his world or will the cruel Skeksis rule forever? <br /> <br />Jim Henson teams up with the visual artistry of Brian Froud to create this fantasy epic.  These puppets go far beyond anything previously known as a Muppet but seem closer to those Henson created for Saturday Night Live.  The scope and vision of this film is one that you would not expect puppets (if they can be called that) to be able to pull off.  This is epic fantasy in the truest sense and joins the ranks of the few epic fantasies that have succeeded in film.  Check it out.
B000HCO83Q|4.0|I don't really like the theme of X-men of comparing these people with special abilities to Jews in Nazi Germany as they are different. <br /> <br />Having said that, this story is probably the best one of the lot. The acting was good. The story flowed quite well. The action scenes were interesting.
B00000K3D4|4.0|A young girl is tired of her stepmother and her new baby half-brother.  But when she makes a comment that she wants the Goblin King to take her brother, it really happens.  She is visited by the King (David Bowie) and learns that if she can get to his castle at the center of the labyrinth in thirteen hours, she will have the chance to get her brother back.  She starts out and quickly learns that things are very different and that things are not fair.  But ,fair or not, she needs to learn how to be unfair as well in order to penetrate the labyrinth. <br /> <br />Along the way she meets strange characters and befriends a few.  all the while the Goblin King is doing what he can to impede her.  Traps and spells are laid and if she falls to any of them she will lose and her brother will become a goblin.  In the end we get a good strong message about not giving up on our dreams. <br /> <br />With a script by Terry Jones, designs by Brian Froud and Jim Henson in charge of it all, you just know this is going to be something special and unique.  The film starts mundanely but quickly progresses to huge amounts of puppets and fabulous effects.  The characters are very memorable although I felt Bowie could have done without the blonde Elvira-wig.  Still, it have been a very rewatchable film that I have seen in the theater, on video, and now on widescreen DVD.  A fun film that is safe and appealing to almost all ages.  Check it out.
B000GTLQXU|4.0|<br />I was very keen on the early Poseidon adventure which I liked. So I was keen to see what Wolgang Petersen, a director I do like, could do with the story. <br /> <br />It found it to being a good movie. It did keep the viewers interests as our heroes go from one episode to the next. So much so I lost track of time throughout the movie. <br /> <br />Having said that this movie has to be compared to the 1972 effort. In which case, I would have to say like so many copies that its not as good as the original. The characters are not so interesting nor is the acting. The story was better explained in the first one and more believable. The special effects are approximately as good. The filming however is better as the newer technology shows. <br /> <br />Still it is worth looking at. <br /> <br /> <br />
0393317552|5.0|This book is a somewhat linear history of the past 13,000 years across the continents.  Diamond seeks to sum up history across various societies on all the continents in a relatively short volume.  The impetus for this search starts with a question from a friend of his from New Guinea named Yali.  Yali's question was, \\"Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?\\" <br /> <br />Reading the book, I think I gulped at this point.  This sounds like a classic, loaded question.  It sounds disturbingly close to why have we (Europe and its former colonies) succeeded where they have failed.  Diamond does not descend into that territory though, but he does not evade criticism for skirting it completely.  There are references to a culture's success in industrializing or condensing populations that Diamond brushes off as a mixed blessing, for instance.  The advantages of a hunting/gathering culture are not really explored outside of the remarkable sustaining nature of southeast Asia. <br /> <br />This history can probably be described (or perhaps is most successful) as based around environmental causation (as opposed to the racial/ethnic/social causation that the lump in my throat had been fearing).  Descriptions of climate (note: that the history begins with the cessation of the last great ice age), longitudinal or latitudinal axes, elevation and landmass differences play a strong role in determining the fate of humanity.  Still, it is interesting to look specifically at the items gathered in the title. <br /> <br />Guns.  Europe's refinement of this technology was based on China's innovations with gunpowder.  Today's dominant society is a product as much of what it has swallowed and thus incorporated as by what it has innovated.  As an interesting counterpoint, Japan had owned more and better guns in c. 1600 CE, than any country in the world.  Samurai rulers first limited then outlawed the technology.  Japan wouldn't resume manufacture until mid 19th century.  Obviously, there is an indisputable importance in the weaponry's influence in shaping the geopolitical world of today. <br /> <br />Germs.  Epidemics left people from cultures based on cities with who could resist smallpox and those dense populations more easily replaced those who didn't survive.  Smaller groups have a distinct disadvantage versus the interdependent and consequently more interchangable larger cities.  Epidemics develop out of these civilizations as germs jump over from domesticated animals (and smaller groups may not even have animals to domesticate).  Interesting note: the emperors of the Mayan and Incan civilizations both succumb to disease (likely smallpox) rather than guns. <br /> <br />Steel.  Technological advancement is keyed on innovations brought about by dense populations and the possibility for abstraction of responsibilities.  A hunter-gatherer culture lacks the abstraction necessary to divide responsibilities to allow for such developments as literacy and mining, as the energies that would fuel these are directed toward survival areas.  Diamond makes an interesting and controversial point that the hunter-gatherer culture may be more attuned to intelligence as an evolutionary necessity over civilized society, where the evolutionary energy may be directed at surviving these epidemic illnesses. <br /> <br />There are many aspects of environment that serve as limiting conditions for the development of these things.  First, there appears to need to be sustainable farming.  Many of the staples of modernity are the crops first domesticated in the fertile crescent region (where today we invade, suck oil, and force the conquered to endure freedom).  The western Asian breadbasket provided the means to bank food so that trades could develop.  As a complete side note, the Genesis book of the bible can be viewed upon through this filter as it goes into great detail how Josephset up a system of storing and meting grain in Egypt to greatly increase the population and avoid the calamity of drought and famine brought on by sustenance farming. <br /> <br />Another factor in the civilizing of Eurasia is the landmass itself.  Compared to Africa and the Americas, Eurasia is mainly west-east axis versus north-south.  Movement of successes in cultivation and domestication could more easily occur because climate differences are easier on a latitudinal basis than on longitudinal.  Something like corn (maize) which was domesticated in central Americas took a very long time to make it to North America because of geography.  Llamas and guinea pigs (which could be useful for pack animals and food) never made it north.  Conversely, all those fertile crescent crops and bigger domesticated animals like cattle, horses, pigs were able to spread from one tip of Asia to the opposite tip of Europe. <br /> <br />To answer Yali's question, some of the answer is luck.  Africa, Australia and the Americas may not have been afforded the botanical or zoological advantages that Eurasia had.  Some other is environmental determinism, where you are helps make up who you become.  For going forward, Diamond cites transportation, communication and information advances as factors that likely will obliviate these historical forces in the future. <br /> <br />After word: Harpers Magazine tackles an issue that was brought up, but not as fully developed here, that of pre-Clovis Native American discoveries (pronouncements), knowingly confronting a loaded racial/ethnocentric question in a folio called \\"Might White of You: Are American Archaeologists White Supremacists?\\"  The archaeological records supports people living in the Americas since about 9000-11000 BCE.  There are scant scraps of evidence prior to that date, but plenty of theories typically more titillating than substantive.  One wonders if the pre-Clovis discovery (especially all the business about \\"caucusoid\\" skulls),isn't so much about archaeology as setting up an imagined genocide to justify a documented genocide. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

0140187863|5.0|Constance Chatterley's gamekeeper, Mellors, brings out the animal in Her Ladyship, and he extends the protection to her that he does to all the wild game in the wood. It is Mellors himself who, in the end, understands that his own baronet, Sir Clifford, is the greatest threat to his most vulnerable charge. Constance's own father, Sir Malcolm, fails utterly to appreciate the situation when he refers to Mellors as the quintessential poacher himself. Sir Malcolm's mistake is that he, along with all of polite society, fails to recognize that humans are, in fact, animals, and that the thrill of conjugal intimacy unites us with all other fauna. We strayed from this notion long ago, with Plato extolling virtuous love, and referring to passions and desires as evil (Book IX of the Phaedrus).<br /><br />Sir Clifford, who is impotent as a result of war injuries, suggests to his wife that she have a discrete affair in order to produce an heir to the estate. \\"I don't care who his father may be as long as he is a healthy man not below normal intelligence.\\" His admonition that Connie be careful not to fall in love in the process foreshadows his tragedy. When we see the gamekeeper, Mellors, placing pheasant eggs into the nests of chickens, in order that they may be reared by surrogate hens, we know, before any of the protagonists themselves, just who Lady Chatterley's surrogate husband will be. Ultimately Connie discovers that Mellors has that rarest of qualities in a man; he enjoys making love only when his partner enjoys it, too. These feelings are a sharp contrast with her experience, and they are both immediately ensnared in a tense carnal conspiracy.<br /><br />In the process, we are treated to D. H. Lawrence's craft:<br /><br />\\"Both sisters mixed with...the young Cambridge group, the group that stood for 'freedom' and flannel trousers, and soft shirts open at the neck, and a well-bred sort of emotional anarchy..., and an ultra-sensitive sort of manner.\\"<br /><br />Tevershall village had \\"rows of wretched, small begrimed brick houses with black slate roofs for lids, sharp angles, and willful blank dreariness.\\"<br /><br />One attraction of her first lover, Michalis, is that he had his own ideas and stated them clearly; \\"he didn't merely walk round them with millions of words, in the parade of the life of the mind.\\"<br /><br />Sir Clifford \\"seemed alert in the foreground, but the background was like the Midlands atmosphere, haze, smoky mist.\\"<br /><br />Before her affair with Mellors, Connie saw sex as \\"just a cocktail term for an excitement that bucked you up for a while, then left you more raggy than ever.\\"<br /><br />Connie realizes of Clifford that, \\"like many insane people, his insanity might be measured by the things he was not aware of: the great desert tracts in his consciousness.\\"<br /><br />\\"She saw her own nakedness in his eyes...\\"<br /><br />This book will not titillate the reader of 2008 as it did the reader of 1928.

The story twists and turns and keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next - and you're always surprised. I stayed up late one night to finish it because I just couldn't wait until the next day to see how it ended and I wasn't disappointed at all. (The whole book club loved it as well.) I might loan this book out to a friend, but I'd make sure I got it back as this one is a keeper!

If your a Damien Rice fan, you'll love it, trust me - we are fans of his music for a reason and only will his fans truely value what he brings to our lives with it. It's much more powerful and much more who Damien Rice has become now than his debut. And more soothing and relaxing at that.

0618680004|5.0|I use the word \\"wickedly\\" in an ironic sense because what is really wicked according to Dawkins is God himself.  Herein that venerable Old Fraud is roasted over the coals and more or less confined to the ashbin.  Nietzsche may have said it first but Dawkins has taken the considerable trouble to pound all the nails into the coffin: God is indeed dead, and may he rest in peace.<br /><br />Well, the personal sort of God who answers (or does not answer) prayers and sends people to heaven or hell and generally makes mischief in the world is dead.  Dawkins himself, perhaps the world's most famous atheist, isn't entirely so sure about some other gods, including the deist god who, it is said, set off the Big Bang and was never heard from again.  Never mind that Dawkins even admits that he is an agnostic (how wishy-washy!), identifying himself as among those who say, \\"I cannot know for certain but I think God is very improbable, and I live my life on the assumption that he is not here.\\" (p. 51)<br /><br />Needless to say, I have some differences with our esteemed and very witty author.  In the chapter on \\"The Roots of Religion\\" Dawkins attempts to account for religion mainly \\"as an accidental by-product\\" (p. 188) of the human mind or as memes infecting our societies.  The Darwinian explanation that religious belief is adaptive is one that he more or less dismisses.  He writes, \\"The fact that religion is ubiquitous probably means that it has worked to the benefit of something, but it may not be us or our genes.  It may be to the benefit of only the religious ideas themselves, to the extent that they behave in a somewhat gene-like way, as replicators.\\" (p. 165)  It seems to me that this is like saying we wear clothes because it is to the benefit of the clothes themselves as replicators rather than because they keep us warm or because they are part of our identification as societal members.<br /><br />He rejects (mostly, anyway) the idea that religion is adaptive in a Darwinian sense because it favors tribal cohesion and allows tribe members to die for the tribe because he rejects (again, for the most part) what is called \\"group selection.\\"  As the author of The Selfish Gene it is difficult for Dawkins to allow that natural selection might operate at the level of the tribe.  Dawkins to his credit admits his bias and allows that \\"Those of us who belittle group selection admit that in principle it can happen.  The question is whether it amounts to a significant force in evolution.\\" (p. 170)<br /><br />Additionally, I must point out, group selection would work not only in regard to kinfolk and tribal members who have plenty of our genes along their DNA strands, but even with other animals, especially with chimps who supposedly share 97% of our genetic endowment.<br /><br />I would also argue that his meme theory in which the delusive ideas of religion are replicated as by-products of our cultures is defective in that the ideas, even after laying dormant, pop up again and again in different guises.  This suggests to me that religious ideas are innate in the same sense that our propensity for language is innate.  Indeed, there are striking similarities between the propagation and the phenomenon of religion and that of language.  They are ubiquitous in all cultures.  They are at their core similar in all cultures, but superficially different in specifics.  Furthermore, there is plenty of evidence that people would as children invent a language if they had none; and we know that people invent religions all the time.  Dawkins mentions Scientology and Mormonism as well as the cargo cult of the South Pacific as fairly recent examples.<br /><br />One other point: Dawkins argues against using God as a creator because then we have to account for the creation of God.  He says this results in an infinite regress unless we \\"make the entirely unwarranted assumption that God himself is immune to the regress.\\" (p. 77)  Putting God aside, isn't it plausibleto assume that the universe has always been here?  To my way of thinking, a universe that popped into existence out of nothing is no more (or less) reasonable than one that has always been here.<br /><br />Despite some minor disagreements, I believe that this is not only Dawkins's best book, but his most entertaining.  It is actually laugh-out-loud funny in parts, especially Chapter 7, about the \\"good\\" book, which is hilarious.  Here's an example: \\"To my naive eyes, 'Thou shalt have no other gods but me' would seem an easy enough commandment to keep: a doddle, one might think, compared with 'Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife.'  Or her ass. (Or her ox.)  Yet throughout the Old Testament, with the same predictable regularity as in bedroom farce, God had only to turn his back for a moment and the Children of Israel would be off and at it with Baal, or some trollop of a graven image.\\" (p. 244)<br /><br />Interesting enough Dawkins argues against identifying children as \\"Christian children,\\" or \\"Muslim children,\\" etc.  He believes that the religious identity of children should be up to them.  He thinks that more attention should be given to this sort of abuse and that sexual abuse should be brought into \\"proportion.\\"  He notes that \\"the News of the World, widely acclaimed in the face of stiff competition as Britain's most disgusting newspaper, organized a 'name and shame' campaign...against pedophiles.\\"  Problem was that some \\"zealots unacquainted with the difference between a pediatrician and a pedophile\\" actually attacked a pediatrician's house! (p. 315)<br /><br />And here's one that will undoubtedly get some of Dawkins's detractors to put on the bare knuckles: \\"horrible as sexual abuse [by priests] no doubt was, the damage was arguably less than the long-term psychological damage inflicted by bringing the child up Catholic in the first place.\\" (p. 317)t plausible to assume that the universe has always been here?

B000FP2OPY|5.0|Hard to find supposedly \\"horror-themed\\" tv shows (and in fact movies too) out there which can really scare you.  \\"Supernatural\\" is one of them. After hearing great accolades about this show and reading reviewer comments in Amazon I'd ordered the set and, needless to say, I am now hooked.  The combination of acting (Jensen and Jared were not only great, they also geled well together), script (stories were good and actually scary), music (great metal tunes), cinematography (muted lighting and all) was potent. <br /> <br />If only they had made other recent similarly-themed tv shows like \\"Kolchak, the Night Stalker\\" like this, we'd have better shows out there. \\"Supernatural\\" truly has the potential to go the way of other great, long-running tv series (ie more than 5 seasons) in the past such as Buffy and X-Files.

0061139378|3.0|I'm having trouble summing up what was wrong with this book, but I think it seemed to move too rapidly and not enough time was spent lingering over some of the truly deliciously wicked parts of the story. Coraline's bravery and the creepy fact of this mirror-image world on the other side of a fake door in her house give the right sort of building materials for a great tale, it's just that Mr. Gaiman didn't seem to follow through on the promise this dark little book had at its start. I really did love the cover design for Coraline, and the idea of this sinister pseudo-world lurking so close to our realm is a neat idea. I don't regret reading Coraline, but it wasn't everything I hoped it would be.

To do so, Poirot has to question every member aboard the Orient Express letting you get to know the characters.

0393327345|5.0|\\"Fight club\\" is an amazing book of it's time. \\"Fight club\\" is about the narrator, an unnamed character who struggles with his growing discomfort with consumerism and changes in the state of masculinity in American culture. In an attempt to overcome this, he creates an underground boxing club as a radical form of psychotherapy. The way Chuck Palahnuik portrays this struggle is mind-blowing. He narrates as if he was an ordinary guy with a wacked-out life. For those who love an easy read, this book is for you. If you like books that pick at the brain, making you go \\"wtf\\" by the end of the book, this book is for you. When you pick up this book, you won't be able to put it down. Those who have seen the movie, should read the book. Those who haven't seen the movie but want to see it, read the book first because this is where it all started. If you want my honest opinion, this book is one of the best books I have ever read, going up there with books, like Watership Down, or the Harry Potter series. THIS IS A MUST READ!!!

On par with How to Be Good. <br />Quarter of the way through the book I thought I wanted to know how it would turn out for each of the characters. Three-quarters through I didn't care anymore.  <br />
B000001GRZ|5.0|The captivating sound, enriched lyricism and profound musicality of Pierre Fournier was always his quotidian landmark. All of us who have his famous Beethoven piano trios with Kempff and Szerying have realized his profound commitment and passion for the instrument.<br /><br />And the whole result of these definitive Suites for cello could not be more fortunate. If I was required for the one hundred best performances of the XX Century, this recording should be included in most of lists.<br /><br />A legendary album that for any reason must absent of your valued personal collection.
B000GFLE86|1.0|Although I am a Madeleine Peyroux fan (thought her previous 2 albums were excellent) I am afraid her latest output 'Half the Perfect World' should have been called 'Music to Put You to Sleep By'   It is so slow and dreary that it takes immense willpower not to (a) turn it off or (b) go to sleep. <br />To me she hasn't produced one good song throughout the album even making the old favourites 'The Summer Wind' and 'Everybody's Talking' sound extremely ordinary.  Very disappointing.
015603252X|5.0|In this book, Amos Oz tells the story of his family, the convergence of several different countries and cultures into one man.<br /><br />He describes precisely the mentality of the immigrants to Israel, the way the Arab/Jewish relationship changed with the creation of the State of Israel, and the formation of the Israeli people.<br /><br />The book is hypnotic, it is hard to read it slowly, and dozens of stories are interlinked leaving no sewing signs. He narrates Israeli history and personal life as one.<br /><br />The title is very accurate in representing the story. His life was surrounded by strong and controversial figures, which make a rich camp for enlightening insights by the author.
B000E1YVZU|3.0|I've seen the stage version of the show on its national tour, and I have to admit that I wasn't hugely impressed by it. However, it was good enough live for me to give the movie a look.<br /><br />Based loosely on Puccini's La Boh&egrave;me, Rent is a rock opera that focuses on the year in the life of a group of friends in New York's East Village who live lives full of art, music, sex, and drugs. The show particularly spotlights the AIDS crisis and how it affects the characters. For the most part, the show made the stage to screen transition well. There were a few awkward moments with characters basically looking at each other and singing - moments that didn't seem to be supported by any subtextual motivations. And the film did allow for flashbacks and other backstory devices that aren't possible on stage. I'm aware that most of the cast members were plucked from the Broadway cast, and they were all really strong. Rosario Dawson, who was new to the effort, did a wonderful job as well.<br /><br />For the most part, I thought this film was a good treatment of the stage show. The director clearly has a great love for the material, and I also got the feeling that the performers really understood the thematic message of the show. The movie (and the stage play) does contain some sensitive material, but nothing that couldn't inspire productive discussion. You'll get a little weepy at the end, so have some tissues handy!
6305754969|4.0|If you like westerns and the Duke you will need this in your collection.
B000001ZS5|5.0|This is Jarre's fourth album (the third being Les Concerts en Chine), but it's offically the third STUDIO album - hence the misconception.  As others have pointed out, it's Jarre's first foray into digital synthesizer, but that doesn't make it any less a substantial piece of work. And yeah, there is the odd-ball piece of circus organ music at the end, but as any serious Jarre fan knows, he did that because he always had a thing about circus organs when he was a kid.  He clearly explains that in his documentary on Oxygene Moscow.  Don't rip the album because you personally didn't like or agree with his inspiration and chioce of a last track. find out the reasons WHY he did that. It's not like they guy just decided he needed filler material...
B000002OX7|5.0|I can remember the first time I heard Baba O'Riley.  I remember where I was, the stereo it was played on, and the type of speakers belting out the amazing sounds.  It was at a party and the girl I had a crush on was there with a white shirt with flowers...   <br /> <br />Oh, do you need a review on this CD?  Sorry, when I hear these songs or even think about them, it takes me pretty far back.  This is one of the best recordings ever.   <br /> <br />Thats all.
0446528056|2.0|I admit, I used to think Nicholas Sparks was dull and unimaginative, and that ALL of his stories sounded the same but with different characters, but after reading almost all of his books, I have to admit that I like his simplicity, and he has slowly become a favorite of mine. I was excited to hear about \\"Dear John\\" coming out, since my husband is a Marine. The book was great at the beginning (aside from using the word 'portending' about a thousand times) up until Savannah sends him the fated \\"Dear John\\" letter. I understand, waiting a long time for a loved one while he is in the military and deployed is painstaking. But to break up with them for choosing to defend your country over being with a loved one? That's a little BS, if you ask me. Especially after John sells his father's collection for a lousy price and then gives it all away to help Savannah's husband. No one in their right mind would do that, but then again, this is Nicholas Sparks.
B00005JPBJ|4.0|This movie is very good but not great.I am happy I saw it. There are some very nasty scenes including the pig guts and when they see how far your body will twist. At the end it is kind of touching because Amanda goes through some emotional scenes. She has to chose. It is weird to see her cry after how crazy she can be.But thats what makes the Saw series great. Go and see this movie before it is to late because if you don't you will be missing out on a lot. Trust me if you don't see it you will not be able to wait for the DVD.
B000FIHJLK|5.0|The cd's have great sound.The only thing that I'm not happy with is that some of what Dio says between songs is cut out in order to fit the concert on 2 cd's.Some of the things that Dio says in between songs is <br />very inspirational and he treats the audience with such respect that it's  <br />nice to hear a vocalist do that.The one example that I can think of is  <br />between Kill the King and Mistreated.Other than that,great cd.
B000EYK2GE|5.0|I agree with the other reviewers...the DVD is an absolute gem.  But to have this finally available on CD, and to be able to listen to it on my iPod on my daily walk, or to blast it in the car...priceless. <br /> <br />Carl was so energized and into this session, and obviously SO touched by the affection and admiration that the \\"youngsters\\" had for him, and that vibe is evident throughout.  Of course it's now bittersweet to hear George Harrison playing with one of his idols, but George's joy is also so clear to see and hear.   <br /> <br />The CD and DVD are both worthy additions to anyone's music collection.
B0000C6K09|5.0|I understand some might complain about the fact that John Williams is not the conductor for the 4-disc set, and that the conductors, Mario Klemens, Nic Raine, Paul Bateman, interpreted the music differently. However, I think it is an amazing tribute to one of the world's greatest composers. I love the music John Williams has composed in the last half-century and this set captures the beauty and power of his music. Being one who loves music, I couldn't pass this oppurtunity up. I highly recommend this CD set for anyone interested in listening to awe-inspiring music.
B00004RKIJ|2.0|I was fooled into buying this reissue by other reviews. 23 minutes mega mix of \\"Don't Leave Me This Way\\"??? Awesome. Not quite. I was sure this was going to be a combo of the 2 11 minute plus versions on the original vinyl 12\\". INSTEAD, you get about 11 minutes of utter choppy editing mess with no flow of melody, which FADES completely before the original 12\\" version begins on the same track--but which runs about 20 seconds shorter than the full 12\\".<br /><br />Now. The rest of the CD--how do I break this to you gently? I don't. Most of the songs have been EDITED. Goes like this:<br /><br />track 1: WAS 6:26 NOW 4:51<br />track 3: WAS 6:13 NOW 4:13<br />track 5: WAS 6:50 NOW 5:22<br />track 6: WAS 8:00 NOW 4:30<br /><br />track 12: WAS \\"Disenchanted\\" (12\\" version)(8:45) NOW completely removed<br /><br />If you already have the original FULL LENGTH CD, the 12\\" vinyl single of \\"Don't Leave Me This Way\\", and \\"Very Best of the Communards and Jimmy Sommerville\\" (which has the same exact slightly shorter version of the 12\\" as its own free standing track), then you DO NOT WANT THIS.
B000GW8RX4|5.0|This dvd is great.It is cleaned up pretty well compared to alot of the bootlegs out there.There are still some lines through the t.v. screen,but <br />I personally can live with that.However I'm a little disappointed with <br />the Long live rock and roll promo video in the fact that the audio is way to fast.Thank God the other 2 promo video's are not like that.But again  <br />I can live with these minor flaws.This does not change my mind about my 5 <br />star rating.Besides Rainbow on a bad day is better than most bands on there best day.
B00005UEAR|4.0|More than any other Dream Theater album, Jordan Rudess displays his prowess on this adventurous collection of songs.  While disc one is somewhat hit and miss for me, the 42 minute epic that is \\"Six Degrees\\" is spectacular and doesn't disappoint.  It's everything I love about this band in that they take dramatic risks and take everything to the absolute maximum.  The overall musicianship is unsurpassed, as usual, but it is the incredible keyboard work that is most impressive.  It's not that the first disc is terrible by any means, it is just shadowed by the grandeur that you'll find on the second one.  Not to be missed if you are a fan of progressive rock.
B00003CWTI|5.0|I myself have been a little oversensitive to movies, and I admit every time I see this movie, it is like the first time, with the way the action is presented and picks up with the score. This is not your average movie.<br /><br />The directing is the best I've seen.<br /><br />Julianne Moore gives a great performance. You may like Freedomland if you agree. She does an excellent job in that as well. She \\"holds\\" the character's emotions in every job and carries it through every change and turn.<br /><br />The most alarming perspective given here in some instances is of Claudia Wilson.<br /><br />The emotions in this film are deeply portrayed and prepared in the most knowledgable way, with understanding of what these people are going through. Tom Cruise's character is a little extreme but necessary to what Paul wanted to show people, with an offense to morals to our defense of morals. It should be our understanding always to accept people in any admiration, and it is necessary to admire these people when watching this. The actors all had their place in this film; none could have been better portrayed. I say this much knowing that the film gets good reviews here, and it really is a good experience with the score by Jon Brion, which is also available.<br /><br />I'm quite superficial where I live, and I know this movie helped bridge that to feeling that people are much more meaningful than our everyday lives grant us to see at the times we need to. Thus, this is a film of good faith in people. I'd just like to see movies like this filmed abroad and not just in the city of angels and New York or Chicago. There is so much more to the world. In fact, movies like this and several others inspired me to write a novel intended to be a movie as well, and it is finished but hasn't been published yet. It's really a long wait to get published with as many people as there are who write.<br /><br />I have a certain ideal for movies that haven't been made yet, and it is closer to reality but relevant throughout, in the way of lifting our emotions at certain scenes as Six Feet Under has done so well. And Magnolia is done intensely and in an exaggerated way but still bringing you to feel for these people. They seem real enough to me that they are people and not characters. We are trying to portray real situations and not shy from it. The most important thing I find in movies that stay with me is that they help us to care more about people and not be ignorant to what they feel or how they behave. We have to know these things in order to be more than just a friend to the people we love and who love us. Sometimes our days aren't so good, and we find that we are far from people, or their days aren't so good, and we find we can do nothing for them. We are repressed, and it's movies like Magnolia to wake us up and bring people worldwide to the next page of what society needs. If you are one to this movement, you will appreciate much of what Magnolia is. Some people I know don't give mind to these things, and it makes me uneasy that people aren't more like me. We are hard to find. Then again, we may all have a mind to these things, I can't tell - we are so repressed.ting our emotions at certain scenes as Six Feet Under has done so well.

B000HT3P7E|5.0|This show is \\"Legen- (wait for it, and I hope you aren't lactose intollerant because the second half of the word is) dary.  Legendary!\\"   <br /> <br />Suit-up!   <br /> <br />This is by far the second most funniest and most entertaining sit-com on air today behind Scrubs.  The cast chemistry is amazing.  The writing is witty and humorous.  The plot line is interesting.   <br /> <br />Barney - or Swarley as he might now be known? (Season 2 reference.) - is by far the spark that really fires the show.  Neil Patrick Harris is absolutely hilarious in this role.  The catch phrases (two of which are listed at the beginning of this review) are highly quotable and his energy for the role is inspiring.  The whole cast fill their roles wonderfully, but Barney really steals the scene whenever he shows up.
B000FVBLEI|5.0|To make a long story short, I just want to say that this album was amazingly well done!!! Yes, they sound is a bit different from their last album but still holds great melodic riffs and yes most memorable solos in recent memory!! <br /> <br />~Metal Mo
B0000C2IQD|5.0|This movie is worth owning. It's a classic tale, well done and very entertaining.
B0007M22TI|5.0|I am very grateful to Meav for the most wonderful sound of music that she and other four Irish girls (Celtic Woman) have given to our global village.  For example, because of my father in heaven, there is an extremely deep meaning to me inside the song \\"You Raised Me Up\\" that I have heard so many different artists performing; however, no one else can sing it better than this group from Ireland.  I still remember one little boy who used to see this world by sitting on the shoulders of one scientific & spiritual giant--my father.  Although the boy has fully grown up and the giant has completed his mission on earth, now riding on the wings of such heavenly music on earth, I have been uplifted higher and higher that I can see beyond the horizon...
B000002AGE|4.0|I have never been big into Weather Report so far, but when I stumbled across this CD only recently it hit me. When did I buy this? Usually I was into bands like The Crusaders, Urban Knights, Michael Franks, etc. but I was pleasantly surprised when instantly recognizing the opener of this CD, \\"Birdland\\". Other reviews mention this classic first track also, and even no-jazz fans will recognize the melody. It's often played on radio and TV. However, this isn't the only good track if you're into jazz and fusion music. \\"A Remark You Made\\" (what a lovely ballad!) and \\"Teen Town\\" are great, \\"Palladium\\" shows why Jaco Pastorius is such an highly-acclaimed bass player, Alex Acuna never came to my attention with more outstanding drumming like this, and Wayne Shorter contributed truly stunning saxophone lines.<br /><br />I also don't think the sound of this CD has aged or sounds outdated. Not at all, it's just REAL handmade music. At times the music transpires as experimental, which I perceive as outbreaks into an open field, a transition from a strict composition. The cover is also great. I will definitely get more CDs of this awesome group. It fully deserves four stars.
B000F3AAUW|4.0|\\"Crazy\\" will always be my song from this summer. Once you listen to it, the song invades your brain. It's addictive. The lyrics are really clever and the beat is fun. I also liked \\"Who Cares.\\" Again, great lyrics. The rest of the album is okay, does not measure up to \\"Crazy,\\" but good work.
B0000041Z5|5.0|I'll make this simple. If your interested in a great set of the four Brahms symphonies pick this up immediately. Great sound(late analogue warmth), terrific performances(Solti and Chicago are sturdy as always), and an extremely low price.<br /><br />This set has several distinct advantages over some of the others out there. For starters each symphony occupies its own cd. Sounds simple enough but I'm quickly tiring of sets that split up symphonies under 80 minutes long just to pack each cd to the brink. Nothing's worse than having a complete symphony and half of another on one cd and the other half of the second symphony on disc number 2. No sense switching discs to listen to one work unless that work is over 80 mintues long(ie- Mahler). I'm also getting sick of sets that couple insequential symphonies together to fill up discs(ie- symphonies number 1 and 4 on one disc). I like to listen in sequential order.<br /><br />This set allows that. One symphony per disc. Discs two and three each have an overture to fill up some time and that's fine since both are after the symphony. I mentioned it early but the price issue is also huge. Sure, you could buy Abbado's Berlin set which is great but be ready to shell out over $120(!) on Amazon. You'll get a couple of additional short works with that set but come on. Is it worth another $100 or so? Your call but I'd say no way.<br />Pick this up for around $20 and be assured that your getting quality Brahms at a great price.
B000F3AAUW|3.0|crazy is obviously a great song.  the rest of the cd is okay, but i don't really listen to it much.
B000CNDIZE|5.0|<br />Being a \\"Six Feet Under\\" fan I was pleased to discover the tune played <br />during the series finale was Sia. <br />At that time I was familiar only with her work with Zero-7. <br />I discovered she has 2 solo cd's. This one is the better of the two. <br />Her first solo cd \\"Healing Is Difficult\\" is more on the R'nB side. <br />\\"Colour The Small One\\" is amazing. Each tune is better than the next. <br />I highly recommend this cd to anyone who listens to Electronic music like  <br />Zero-7, Bjork, Portished and Emiliana Torrini. <br />Buy this cd.
074322454X|5.0|Excellent! Ambrose has written an 'easy read' which eliminates the military 'strategy/tech-talk', and brings the hardships of WW2 down to his 'Citizen Soldier' level best; On almost every page, one can feel that very special bond becoming stronger among this special 'band of brothers'...start to finish. <br />Seems even more meaningful and real if read within the context of  the 'war stories' many of us have heard from relatives and/or friends who served anywhere in the ETO (As did my own father). <br />Read the book, buy or rent the VHS/DVD HBO series, then read the book  again. Well worth it. <br /> <br />Steve
B000IU3XU6|5.0|I've been a Josh Groban fan for quite some time now. Ever since I  <br />heard his rendition of \\"the prayer\\" he's been one of my favorite  <br />musicians. I was somewhat let down by his recent albums with the  <br />\\"pop\\" turn his music was going in like \\"Closer\\". Also the live  <br />albums were great, but there was nothing new. This album goes back to  <br />his roots from his self titled album \\"Josh Groban\\" released in 2001.  <br />The first single \\"You are Loved\\" is probably as pop as the album  <br />gets, and even that song is simply amazing with his falsetto. Songs  <br />like \\"L'Ultima Notte\\" and \\"So She dances\\" mix his classical style  <br />with the soft rock feel that classic Josh fans should love. Solo Por  <br />Ti brings back the classic guitar heard in earlier songs like  <br />\\"alejate\\" and \\"vincent\\". the acapella track \\"Lullabye\\" is a real  <br />change for Josh. You can hear the influence from Dave Matthews in  <br />background vocals. Apparently it was inspired to his recent trip to  <br />South Africa (where dave matthews is from) where he also met Nelson  <br />Mandela. He performs this with the help of Ladysmith Black Mambazo,  <br />which really gives it an almost gospel sound type sound not heard  <br />from Josh before. \\"weeping\\", also performed with Ladysmith Black  <br />Mambazo has more of a \\"tribal\\" feel to it (like Lion King) also,  <br />excellent and different for Josh. <br /> <br />Though the bonus tracks are great on the Special Edition, I'm not  <br />sure the almost double price difference is worth it. The DVD is only  <br />33 minutes long and simply is the \\"making\\" of the album. I think the  <br />title track \\"Awake\\" could have been the first slow single off this  <br />album and included in the normal release. <br />\\"Verita\\" is a wonderful orchestra arrangement also typical of  <br />classic Josh material. <br /> <br />All in all, this is the quintessential Josh Groban album, mixing his  <br />ability to sing classical and mixpop and soft rock overtones into  <br />it. It's a must buy for all levels of Josh fans. <br />
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I think the writer before this got most of the heart of my comments.  But I will say, that being 31 and not too much of a fan of prog when prog was cool (1yo?), I like this alb best.   This is the most rockin and the least amount of annoying shredding (sorry, not too much a fan of the shredding and keyboarding).  <br /> <br />This alb is the most accessible to a modern rocker from my perspective.  I am a huge fan of Tool and Porcupine Tree and picked up DT on suggestions.  I have most all of theirs now, but this and Six Degrees are my favorites.  Octavarium is a throw back to older style, which I don't care as much for, which many DT fans apparently do.  This is just another perspective.  <br /> <br />This ISN'T anything close to nu-metal!  I followed that scene for a bit and quickly tired.  This is far more talented then that.  Portnoy is my 3rd favorite drummer (Danny Carey #1, Smashing Pumpkins drummer who's-name-escapes-me-at-this-moment #2).  <br /> <br />
B0006SSOHC|2.0|I was sure that it would be really scary; however I was wrong. It is one of those movies which do not raise your heartbeat and do not have any real special effects. You can buy it maybe for your DVD collection, bout do not pay too much.
B000I5X81A|3.0|A nice sounding, laid-back groove by these two fine guitarists will please a lot of listeners looking for a mellow buzz. J.J. Cale's wonderful, hypnotic weirdness peeks through in \\"Heads in Georgia,\\" and there are plenty of tasteful, polished guitar leads over mid-tempo shuffles. As comfortable as a lite beer and a hammock, and about as stimulating.
B000J10ERO|5.0|Anyone who says anything negative about this movie probably only saw it once. I am a die-hard Superman fan. I live and breath Superman. I tried (with no avail) to keep my expectations low for this movie, and saddly I was a bit dissapointed in my first viewing. I mean, it wasn't terrible, but there was one key (spoiler) element to the movie that REALLY dug at me and kept me from totally enjoying it. After the first viewing, I liked it, but I did not LOVE it. <br /> <br />I then went back to see it again and I was F-L-O-O-R-E-D. The movie was BEYOND fantastic and I couldn't for the life of me see what I didn't like about it the first time. I was incredibly surprised by how much I just LOVED and adored this movie the second time around. I came out of the theater, jaw gaping, and chalked it up on my all-time favorite movies list. <br /> <br />Since then I went 3 more times to the theaters. It's the only movie I saw more than once in the theaters. This movie is VERY rewatchable. Even on the 5th viewing I was as rivited as I was the 1st and 2nd times. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
0679731725|5.0|Mr. Stevens, the proper English butler, is one of the great characters of contemporary literature. His voice is so affecting, so real. The first time I read this novel, I returned to page one after reading the final page because I could not deny myself the painful pleasure of reading it again.  I've read it two or three times since.  It's more like dreaming than reading, really.  A masterpiece.
0060776579|5.0|Eker has to be respected for his accomplishments.The transformed mind has to go before the transformed Bank account. But, my personal preference is the exhaustive and more systematic presentations that Brain Tracy makes. Eker is probably a very motivating speaker! Having said that he gets 4 stars because it is a classic book/CD. It needs to be in every millionare library.
B00026W82U|5.0|and erlend oye may be the most talented song writer of his generation.   <br /> <br />the disk grows better and more nuanced with each listen.  the lyrics are outstanding throughout.  in this genre of music, it is really difficult to find a better disk (though 'quiet is the new loud' is in the running)
B000H5U65C|4.0|This is a great collection of songs from a talented band.  Mastodon has set the pace for new metal, throwing down all of the barriers which seem to prevent an otherwise accepted flow of talent.  Blood Mountain will certainly be marked as a classic, along with Master of Puppets, Korn's first album, Rage Against the Machine, Aenemia, etc.  Mastodon has defined a new generation of metal fans, and Blood Mountain is probably just the tip of the iceberg of what this group has to offer.  As \\"The Wolf is Loose\\" opens the album, the listener is thrown into a different world of searing rythym and genius guitar work.  \\"Caprillian Crest\\" is an incredibly crafted track, with the members trading sections like jazz musicians.  Josh from Queens of the Stone Age offers his help on \\"Colony of Birchmen\\", only adding an icing of genius to this cake of delight.  Every song on this album has something great to offer.  It's definitley worthy of recognition as perhaps the best metal album in the last few years from any band in the genre.  The only track that doesn't belong as I see it only used for filler is the instrumental \\"Bladecatcher\\", a piece that gets skipped on my CD player usually. Buy this record! It rules!
B000I5X81K|5.0|I don't even have enough words to say about this gorgeous new third studio album from the great Josh Groban.  Every song is powerfully sung and is very unique.  I'm also very pleased to see that he wrote such terrific songs and collaborated with some of the greats like Herbie Hancock and Ladysmith Black Mambazo.  I love the mix of different music on this album.  I can't wait for his tour (loyal Grobanite!!!!!)  Great job, Josh!  The voice is better than ever!!!!!!
B0000524CY|5.0|Every time i sit down to wacht this movies it gives me the creeps,I really enjoyed this version.
B00006LHYC|2.0|Initially heard of Laura Pausini singing with Michael Buble. This album is easy listening but it's as if the people handling her english songs don't quite know which ones are best for her
B000FQJAIW|3.0|I am one of those geeks who was ten years old when Star Wars came out (note: it was not originally called \\"Episode IV.\\") I watched it in the theater perhaps a dozen times. It was the most amazing thing I had ever seen. <br /> <br />This release contains two DVDs: the version that Lucas has been tinkering with, and on a bonus disc, the original movie in 4:3 letterbox, taken from the best-available videodisc masters. <br /> <br />About that \\"tinkering.\\" The 2004 version of Episode 4 looks, for the most part, quite gorgeous. The _restoration_ that Lucasfilm did is impressive: the blacks are blacker, the whites whiter, the color richer, the contrast improved all around, and the soundtrack is great. The dirt and scratches are gone, the shaky color very solid. <br /> <br />However, at some point Lucas crossed over from \\"restoration\\" into making a new movie. That's fine; he has the right to do so. But for him to say that the original Star Wars is not really what he had in mind, when it was one of the most famous and popular movies in history and became entrenched in the culture -- well, I find that weirdly arrogant. And when he says, in effect, that his altered version _is_ \\"Star Wars\\" and the original _isn't_ -- well, hmmm. A movie is a historical artifact. There's a difference between preservation and tinkering. Mainly, that tinkering mostly is there to gratify the artist, while preservation serves the art -- and the fans of the art. Artistic creation is a fragile and uncertain process. For Lucas to assume that he knew exactly what made Star Wars great and presume to make it better misstates the amount of control that artists actually have over how their creations are received by the public. <br /> <br />Where you draw this line is slightly unclear. I think the cleanup of the backgrounds is fine. The improvement of the soundtrack to use the latest technology available is wonderful. I'm not sure why Kenobi's weird cry that drives away the sandpeople was replaced with a slightly different weird cry. He's redone some of the explosions twice now. I'm not sure why they all became pink in 2004. Why did he feel that Alderaan and the Death Star needed to explode in giant rings? Why do the lightsabers now give off blinding green flashes when they collide? Most of these changes are not improvements; they are just distractions. They tend to stick out like a sore thumb to fans who have seen the movie many times. <br /> <br />But there are more than just the small arbitrary changes, I'm not really happy with the addition of dinosaur-like creatures in Mos Eisley, and I'm really not happy with giving these little bits and pieces cartoonish _sound_ that sounds like it came from Episode 1. Star Wars, the original, had a different tone, a different mood, than Empire and Jedi and the whole prequel trilogy. It's a little darker. It's a world where rebels and stormtroopers are violently killed and Han Solo shoots first. Lucas is free to make that world happier and more cartoonish in his later films, but altering, and in some cases censoring violence from the original, is a very strange thing to do. <br /> <br />So, although I really admire the improvements to the image and sound in the 2004 edition, I generally prefer watching the original 1977 cut. For that, I'm sorry to report that the digital transfer, from the videodisc master, is only adequate. Many fans are griping that it is 4:3 instead of anamorphic 19:9. This means it isn't full-width on a widescreen TV. That doesn't particularly bother me, but I'm viewing it on an old TV, not a widescreen TV. It looks like a very good analog videotape, but we've recently -- and rather abruptly, in terms of years -- gotten used to DVDs of films that were transferred to the digital realm and mastered there. It's actually taken from the master for the analog videodisc. The audio is good, but again we now tend to compare it to all-digital productions. Negative comments on Amazon about the black level are on the mark; some of the space scenes make black outer space look brown, or gray. This is particularly evident when we see Vader's helmet in his tie fighter; his helmet is blacker than the black background of space. But that is true in the original film; it was noticeable in the theater on opening day. A number of the desert scenes have poor contrast and faded color; some of this is film deterioration, and some is because the contrast and color in some of the outdoor Tatooine scenes were never that good to begin with. There are noticeable scratches. The color is shaky in some scenes, particularly outdoor scenes, and flickers a bit. It looks like a film that is considerably older than it is. I've seen restored films from considerably earlier that look a lot better than this one does. <br /> <br />Here's the thing: it didn't have to be this way. We would have considered it to be a fairly good video rendering at one point in time. But our expectations have been raised considerably -- and, in fact, Lucas himself is largely responsible for raising those expectations, because of his constant embrace of new technology for delivering films to audiences. The 2004 DVD release has all those black level problems fixed. There aren't any visible scratches. The contrast is excellent. The colors are vivid. The missing dialog is restored. <br /> <br />So which version do I want to watch? Well, the answer is neither. I want to watch a version that doesn't exist: call it \\"Star Wars: the Nostalgia Edition.\\" That version would be fully _restored_, but not _altered_. And it would have things like Han Solo's scene with Jabba available as a \\"deleted scene\\" special feature, along with all the other so-called lost footage such as the scene at Anchorhead, which introduces (and makes sense of) Luke's relationship with Biggs. It would have been presented with respect for the original work, not as a bonus disc given no special treatment. Instead, Lucas has disowned that picture. <br /> <br />And here'sthe thing: I'd be shocked if Lucas didn't have every scene, unaltered, from the first film in beautifully restored digital form. After all, wouldn't a restored original film have been the starting point for this whole process of remastering that led to the 1997 and 2004 versions? <br /> <br />So, I'm not actually advocating that we give up the advances in restoration that are evident in the 2004 release. But don't bother with the tinkering. The fans don't care about it. Keep the original death star cell block footage. Sure, the tunnel behind the actors is obviously a matte painting, and the perspective is off kilter when the camera angle changes. But you know what? I saw Star Wars at least ten times in the theater and I never noticed the problem -- because it isn't a \\"problem,\\" it's an artifact of the budget and technology that existed in 1977. You notice it if you are looking at the frame cynically, not when you are immersed in the story. It might be an irritant to Lucas now, but it is the effect we grew up with. For the \\"Nostalgia Edition,\\" let Star Wars be Star Wars. <br /> <br />Then Lucas can go on with his director's cuts, turning Star Wars into a 3-D cartoon until the sun explodes, for all I care. Just don't make me watch Greedo shoot first!
0698116496|5.0|Parents, your preschooler will delight in discovering details in this charming book.  Others have noted the ever-present mouse with the banana on a string.  The mouse got the string by gnawing free a balloon, which subsequently appears in every scene (that isn't inside).  No one else, however, seems to have noticed the figures in the window in the house next to the zookeeper's.  In one panel there is one person, the next has two, and then there are three.  Why are these people awake?!  By the clock in the zookeeper's bedroom it's ten-thirty at night!  This is one book my two year old wants to hear again and again, pointing out where that mouse is, where that balloon is, counting the people in the window.  Don't forget to point out that, by the time the gorilla goes to sleep, he has eaten that banana.
B000001EUR|2.0|I am an old Scorpions fan, and always considered \\"Love At Firts Sting\\" one of their best albums of latter era. Actually, it's their last album with some original ideas, just like \\"Flick Of The Switch\\" was for AC/DC. <br /> <br />I purchased this album when I started replacing my dust gathering collection of tape records made in 80's and early 90's, finally having decided to get some quality sound of my old idols. How great was my disappointment wheh I have heard this CD! The quality is quite similair to what I had on my old tape - low record level, high frequencies are not audible. In short - you've got nothing of Mattias Jabs and Rudy Schenker guitars, quite a little of Klaus Meine voice, which was good back then. <br /> <br />I've heard Scorpions live this summer on private concert in Moscow: they performed mostly the songs from this album, and even given all those years passed, they sounded better.
076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie was a fantastic account of an elderly man and his views on different parts of life.  It made me think of things I hadn't thought of before and it really inspired me to rethink how I spend my time and who I do or do not spend it with.  It made me grateful of my family and of my closest friends and it greatly taught me how important it is to be at peace with everyone and love every chance I get.  Morrie made death seem less scary and made it seem like a natural process, not sad and devastating.
B000H5U832|5.0|I was surprised to really adore this movie since, it's a car movie, but I know Pixar just produces amazing movies. This cute story of the racing circuit featuring a cocky modern sports car and the wise classic veteran that teaches him about the heart of the sport of racing is just so classic and fun. I absolutely loved the credits featuring the other Pixar movies in car form was just great. I'm now eagerly awaiting the next Pixar Movie.
1931559317|4.0|This atlas is thoughtfully laid out for use at the telescope in the field. The paper is a heavy dull-white stock that does not show reflection under a red light. Because the book is spiral bound, the pages lay flat freeing up your hands. No more trying to find a heavy object to keep the pages from turning. <br /> <br />Inside the front cover you will find printed a sample double page chart layout with a legend. Also printed is an angular distance scale and a Telrad bull's eye.  I made a clear transparency copy of this page using an 8 ½\\" x 11\\"sheet of overhead projector film by running it through a copy machine.  I cut out the angular scale and then I cut the Telrad bull's eye in a long rectangle about 1\\" x 3\\" leaving the bull's eye at one end and using the other end as a handle to move the finder around the map.  I put these in a small envelope and tucked it inside the atlas. <br /> <br />The contents page lists the best months to view the objects by R.A. range during evening, midnight and mourning and on which chart to find them. Towards the end of the atlas, there are four close-up charts of some of the most observed regions of the sky. The index is broken down by star name, galaxies, open and globular clusters, bright, dark and planetary nebulae.  The Caldwell and Messier catalogs are listed separately.  The back cover has the chart key for both north and south hemispheres. There are 80 main charts containing 30,796 stars to magnitude 7.6. <br /> <br /> The introduction explains in easy to understand detail how the charts are labeled and arranged. The same chart legend appears on the first page of each chart as well as the R.A. range and best time and month for viewing. All the charts are printed in color on a white background for easy reading under a red light. A location guide to constellations and what the Greek star letters mean is also included. <br /> <br />Each page has the same basic layout as any good star atlas. The lines for the R.A and Declination are clearly marked. You will notice that a small blue triangle with a number inside is located on three sides of each page.  These triangles point to the adjoining charts that make up more of that part of the sky. The number in the triangle indicate which chart. <br /> <br />There are two printing errors in the atlas on page 55 and on the close-up Chart C.  You can download the printable corrected color pages from the Sky and Telescope website. <br />You can the cut and paste the corrected pages directly over the page in the book.  I used spray adhesive. <br /> <br />Bottom line, this is a very compact and easy to use atlas you'll ever come across. It is very user friendly and a must have to \\"grab and go\\" with your favorite telescope or binoculars. <br />                           Book reviewed by Jack Fox, Richmond Astronomical Society
B000FFJYCU|5.0|As one of many F1 fans who eagerly awaited the release of this DVD, I wasn't a bit disappointed.  After seeing the theatrical release in the late sixties, my fascination and love for F1 racing began. I attended my first race in 1969 at Clermont Ferrand, one of the circuits featured in the movie.  The movie does an incredible job at depicting the essence of Formula 1 and, for those who have followed the racing series, it's a fascinating look at the evolution of the cars and tracks.  The inherent lack of safety in F1 racing at the time-both for drivers and spectators is hard to fathom in terms of today's level of safety when drivers walk away from horrendous appearing wrecks.  Similarly, it's amazing to see the virtually unrestrained nature of spectator access to track areas as shown in the film.  I can attest to the accuracy of that as I recall actually walking (maybe running) across a section of the track, during the race, at Clermont Ferrand during the race to gain a better vantage point.  Foolish as that may sound now, it was common at the time  The special features segment with commentary from the actors, director, actual F1 racers from that era, and current Formula 1 TV personalities and journalists is terrific.  For any fan of Formula 1 racing, this is a must have.
0446310786|5.0|I never was required to read this book in school and only picked it up 20 years later at the continued insistance of a friend.  I hesitated to read it, not thinking I would like it, and to my surprise I loved the book.

B000IU3XTW|5.0|I have been a big Fan of Foo Fighters since the beginning and have enjoyed watching Mr Grohl and Co. emerge as one of the best bands of our time. On this album we are treated to the Foo Fighters acoustically, and just like another acoustic set Dave Grohl was a part of,(Nirvana Unplugged), we are treated to a great sounding live album and some increadable rearrangments of all our favorites. Songs like Marigold, My Hero, Next Year and my favorite song on the album, Times Like These, come alive and are an enjoyment to the hearing. Nirvana Unplugged may be the best accoustic set ever recorded and it is apperant thet Grohl learned his chops and expertly used what he learned on a great set and a great album.

0684857219|4.0|This is an excellent book which leaves no stone unturned in relation to bodybuilding. Hardly surprising as its by the greatest bodybuilder of all time. Like one of the other reviewers however I would also was a little surprised by the 6 days a week somtimes both morning and evening training programme. As a fitness instructor I wouldnt have recomended this although Ive never been Mr Universe. The exercises themselves are very well explained and there are plenty of them which is useful to people who do any sort of weight training. The pictures are superb and there are many interesting tips with regard to different elements of fitness. <br />This book is well worth the money so if you are thinking of buying it think no more..

B000002IR9|5.0|Memphis has produced many great musicians.  Sam Phillips' Sun Studio, launched in February 1952, boasted Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins and Roy Orbison. Beale Street started BB King's career.  And then there was Stax/Volt, home to Otis Redding, Sam and Dave, Johnnie Taylor and Rufus Thomas.  These Stax acts, ably backed by one of the greatest studio bands of all time, otherwise known as Booker T. and the MGs, have left us unmatched rhythm and blues.  (Now, I'm not going to get into the argument of which had the greatest studio band, Detroit's Motown, Atlantic's Muscle Shoals, or Stax: I'm just not competent to do so, unfortunately. I'm just going to say that with Booker T and the MGs behind him, Otis Redding has to be on the short list for greatest rhythm and blues singer, greatest Southern soul singer, however you prefer to characterize his music.)  \\"Sitting on The Dock of the Bay,\\" \\"Knock on Wood,\\" \\"Try a Little Tenderness,\\" \\"I'm Coming Home:\\" the man had range.  What he didn't have, on his own, was humor: that's where Carla Thomas, daughter of Rufus, came in.  \\"Tramp\\" is an exuberant corn-pone-flavored duet: once heard, it lingers in the mind, or at least in mine.  It's funny.  The rest of this record, first released in 1967, lingers well, too: the covers of several rock and roll masterpieces like \\"Tell It Like It Is,\\" \\"It Takes Two,\\"and \\"Bring It On Home to Me,\\" are crisp, light-handed, and sure-footed.<br /><br />People say that the late, great Marvin Gaye never sang better than when he was paired with Tammi Terrell; that's a matter of personal taste, and I wouldn't say the same about Otis Redding and Carla Thomas.  I would say they sang superbly together: if you love 1960's Southern soul, you want to get this rare record before it goes out of print.

0761129235|5.0|Ask the questions: \\"How do people succeed?\\" and \\"How do successful people stay successful?\\" Innovation is a drastic process of change. \\"A journey of a thousand miles begin with the first step\\". All change is scary, even small ones. Attempts to achieve change through radical or revolutionary process often fail because they heighten fear. The small steps approach disarm the brain's fear response, stimulate rational thought, and engage creativity.<br /><br />Ask small questions: 1. Small questions creates an environment where creativity and playfulness is unabashed. 2. Small questions abate fear and are not perceived as threatening. 3. Small question demonstrate interest and importance. 4. The brain loves questions 5. Let other brains chew on the questions for a few days. 6. Questions help individuals move from constriction and constraint towards creativity. The cortex is engaged and moving the person towards success and help you tiptoe past the amygdala and resistence begins to weaken. Fear is replaced with excitement and determination to reach the goal.<br /><br />Think small thoughts: 1. \\"Mind sculpture, developed by Ian Roberson, involves stil-imaginery sensory immersion. It requires the practitioner to pretend that they are actually engaged in the action, not just seeing but hearing, tasting, smelling, and touching. In mind sculpture, people image the movement of their muscles, and the rise and fall of their emotions.\\" 2. Mind sculpture allows the practitioner to walk past any mental obstacle. 3. By using Mind sculpturing it will help you feel comfortable about something that feels uncomfortable to you. First, isolate the task your afraid of. Second, decide how many seconds you're willing to devote to mind sculpture for this task each day. Third, when your ready to practice mind sculpture, sit or lie down in a quiet, comfortable spot and close your eyes. Fourth, image your in the difficult and uncomfortable situation. Fifth, expand the visualization to your other senses. Sixth, without moving a muscle image you are performing your task. Seventh, image a positive response to your task. Last, when your ready, try it out with a few small steps.<br /><br />Small Steps: 1. Small actions form the basis of Kaizen thought. Big bold efforts create fear and anxiety. A Small effort is neither disruptive nor complex to implement, but have big effects. 2. Ask small questions to eliminate fear and help visualize the small step occurring in your mind. Small steps are free. Kaizen steps may be small but they often lead to rapid change. The small step lead you to the 2nd step and onto the 3rd Step. Small steps build confidence in the change process. Start by asking the question, \\"How can I get the goal done in one minute per day?\\" Kaizen power can melt even the toughest resistence.<br /><br />Solve Small Problems: 1. Recall a major mistake you made at some point in your life. What were the small signs that indicated things were not going according to plan? Did you halt the assembly line and start over? Did you ignore the problem in the hopes you'd achieve your results on time anyway? 2. Identify one small mistake 3. Ask yourself if the mistake is part of a larger problem and has the potential to gather velocity. What step can you take to correct the situation? 4. Awareness reduces the probability of repeating the mistake.<br /><br />Bestow Small Rewards: 1. The reward should be appropriate to the goal. 2. The reward should be appropriate to the person 3. The reward should be free or inexpensive. Eiji Toyoda boast, \\"Our workers provide 1.5 million suggestions a year and 95 percent of them are put to practical use.\\" In Japan the average reward is $3.88 as opposed to the American average of $458.00).

Those two songs were the reason I bought this CD for my wife. It wasn't until 30 days later after receiving the CD that my wife mentioned those 2 tracks were not on the CD; therefore I cannot return or exchange this CD for the correct version anymore.

B00003CXB4|5.0|I remember when I was a little kid when I saw The Lion King in the theater how amazed and moved by the animal characters that Disney put its touch on with the animation. Now that I am an adult It is now an even greater film to me because of the context of the story of father and son love, revenge, tyranny, friendship, childhood romance, war, and growing up. Lately I was able to get my hands on the new platinum edition that was put back in the Disney vault some time ago and it is just beautiful. I have always thought that The Lion King is a work of art and genius from the makers of Disney.  How they were able to make the main character Simba into an amalgam of Hamlet and Odysseus and villain Scar into a lion archetype of Adolf Hitler gave the film a wonderful imagination.  I have word one to the parents and that is to let your kids watch this film.  They will forever remember the awesome and entertaining chracters such as: Simba, Mufasa, Timon, Pumba, Rafiki, and the deceivingly evil Scar and his army of hyenas.  It is a beautiful film that to this day conveys powerful emotion unmatched by many.  This is simply put my favorite Disney movie.
B000006YMM|3.0|You have to wonder what's going on, when Agnetha and Eric Stewart put rubbish like 'click track' on the album, which has nothing to commend it, then leave off 'you're there' and 'turn the world around', two of the best b-sides from this period. What were they thinking? Particularly, as the former is a ballad co-written by Agnetha herself. <br />The outstanding track on the album is definitely 'the angels cry' a beautiful lush ballad with nice guitars and atmospheric keyboards. Justin Hayward of the Moody Blues wrote this and it just demonstrates his immense talent.

B000002UAI|3.0|This album was completely rushed, and listening to the songs it shows. If they had had some more time, they would have undoubtebly crated an album full of originals. I find the covers all pointless. <br />Lennon is all over the album. The most mature songwriting is from him. 'No reply' and 'I'm a loser' are more story like in their lyric and the latter has a Dylanesque introvesion, also apparent in the melodic 'I don't want to spoil the party'. <br />McCartney's contributions vocally and composition wise are a bit limited. He sings 'I'll follow the sun', but although a nice ballad, it is an old song, already at least four years in 1964. The only other track he composed is 'what you're doing', which is a bit tuneless and very poor on the lyrical front, as opposed to Lennon's work at the time. <br />He also composed most of 'every little thing' and 'eight days a week', but Lennon's vocals were to the fore again. <br />It would remain at least a year before McCartney reached Lennon's standard of songwriting. <br />As for Harrison's contribution it is a poor cover and he sings with little soul and out of tune. ringo simply cannot sing and his constant repetition of 'honey don't' is merely laughable. <br />Weak by their standards, although a few minor gems were here. Also, the track 'leave my kitten alone' should have been included and why this was left out, is the fault of whoever decided on the tracklisting. It is better than half the tracks here.
B00003ZA27|3.0|Well, if you hate Karajan this is one of his recordings that should bring out the most venom. I don't hate Karajan, actually the man is my favorite conductor. Looking at this performance of Bach's Mass in B minor, you get all the problems that can creep in on a traditional reading of a major Bach piece. The tempos might be slow by today's standards, but that's not the end of the world, Klemperer gets away with that all the time. What hampers Karajan's reading the most is his unique sound. By this time in the 1970's when this was recorded, Karajan had fully realized his cultivation of smoothness and hemogeny from the Berlin Philharmonic. We have to remember that Karajan in the 1950's and 1960's sounded a lot less smooth. He was more rugged, masculine and powerful. But moving into the 1970's and 1980's he was accused more often of his penchant for the smooth line.     The choir in this recording is not always immaculate, actually the Vienna Singverein lets Karajan down on many occassions. The soloists generally do a nice job. I was reading a biography of Karajan by Richard Osbourne and Osbourne wrote a passage in the book where he mentioned that Karajan himself was dissatisfied with this recording of the Bach Mass in B minor and that he wanted to do it over again later but ultimately never got the chance. I can understand his point as this is not one of Karajan's most illuminating records. Karajan also recorded Bach's St. Matthew Passion in the 1970's and that recording is much better than this one, Karajan himself was very proud of it as mentioned in the book.    Regardless of the fact that Karajan's Mass in B minor isn't one of the best, it's still pretty decent. The performance is remastered using DG's Original-Image Bit-Processing and it sounds better than before. For alternatives to Karajan, check out George Solti with the Chicago Symphony and Chorus in the 1990's if you want a large scale reading that has more passion and fire. Of course the period instrument fans will gravitate to Gardiner's famous record on DG Archiv, while I personally prefer Philipe Herreweghe's more spiritually involving recording on the label Harmonia Mundi in place of Gardiner.
B00000DCH9|2.0|There are great songs here, but you're better off hearing the live versions on Songs In The Attic, or any of his other live discs. The problem here is the sound quality (probably of the original recordings) is very poor. Clearly, you can tell that great things were ahead for the relative unknown singer-songwriter.
B000001G53|5.0|This Parsifal was recorded in 1980, can anyone name a single Parsifal that can compete with this Karajan version in the digital era? Barenboim, Levine, Thielemann? I don't think so. I understand Knappertbusch's famous versions from the past still hold sway for some but Karajan is by the far and away the greatest conductor of this opera in the last 30 years or more!    Some have complained about Peter Hofman's Parsifal but most would agree that Kurt Moll as Gurnemanz is a major highlight of this package. The big choral numbers are magnificent and the Berlin Philharmonic was still the greatest orchestra in the world at the time of this recording and boy, do they sound it! Karajan's approach is both meditative and dramatic in the appropriate places, he is a true visionary. His complete Wagner opera recordings have always had their critics in the past, whose recordings haven't had critics? However, be that as it may, this Parsifal has always been critically embraced and many listeners regard it as one of Karajan's supreme achievements, especially in the last decade of his life.    The sound is digital, from 1980 and thank God, Deutsche Grammophon acquit themselves so well! The sound is lush, warm, detailed and has a glorious panorama. Just listen to the bells in the transformation scene. DG really did poorly in the arena of digital recordings initially, I am so thankful that they got their best engineers for this Parsifal, because it sounds radiant and magnificent!     The only thing that grates on my nerves about this outstanding recording is the booklet with the English translations. The translations are not given with track numbers so you can get lost in the music, every other opera set I've ever bought has translations co-ordinated to the corresponding track. Did I just get a strange copy of the booklet or is everyone's booklet like this? If you don't know German, you have to really pay attention and mark which translation begins with which track and it can get pretty annoying. DG can be really stupid sometimes, I swear! Nonetheless, this is a must own set for all Wagner fans.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This series was is very realistic and believable. The acting and cinema photography is exceptional. Being a Marine veteran, I felt the pain from the loss of each man and the exhilaration of the final victory. The packaging was well conceived. I feel the pricing was well worth the package I relieved. I consider this to be the star of my over 800 DVD collection.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|\\"Plans\\" signalled my first exposure to Death Cab For Cutie, thanks to radio play given to \\"Soul Meets Body\\" and \\"Crooked Teeth\\" - the most up-tempo songs on the album.  I was first captured by the band's clever and thoughtful (if not offbeat) lyrics on those two songs, which carryover into the album's remaining tracks.  \\"Different Names...\\" is probably the weakest lyrically, but it worth mentioning because it's a fantastic song musically divided up into two parts (see Ryan Adams' \\"Shadowlands\\").  \\"What Sara Said\\" is probably the most lyrically brilliant, and the most somber due to the haunting message (\\"love is watching someone die\\").  \\"Brothers On A Hotel Bed\\" is also worth noting, which tells the story of a man's struggle to cope with becoming middle-aged (\\"these wrinkles masterfully disguise the youthful boy below\\").  Overall, a great alternative album that gets better after each listening.
B00003CXD5|5.0|What can I say.  This is one of the best movies of all time, starring Humphrey Bogart, Walter Houston and Tim Holt, directed by Walter Houston's son, John Houston (The Asphalt Jungle, The African Queen).  Filmed on location in Mexico, it's the story of two down on their luck Americans (Bogart and Holt) who meet a grizzly old prospector (Houston) in a cheap hotel and decide to go prospecting for gold.  Graphic and gritty, with great acting and great story with many twists and turns, we watch as our characters open the sluice gates to rinse the gold from the tons of ore they mine and also washes away the trappings of civilization and reveals there true character.  It's a classic.
B0009HKH6Q|4.0|director norman jewison was on a nice run in the mid-late 60s, with movies like \\"cincinatti kid\\", \\"in the heat of the night\\", and this splendid exercise in style. the opening half hour, depicting the actual heist, is highlighted by the split-screen split-narrative effect; if the latter portion (once the faye dunaway character arrives) is not AS interesting, it remains a gripping watch, highlighted by the chess game sequence leading up to \\"the kiss\\", and superbly scored by michel legrand, featuring one of the best pop songs of its time \\"the windmills of your mind\\". <br />

0792164903|3.0|while i thoroughly enjoyed the opening hour of this tim burton / johnny depp collaboration, it loses all its energy in its secind half. as always, its visually interesting but the plotline falls back upon the revenge destroys cliche. it will be interesting to see just what this director & frequent muse wreak upon their upcoming project, the ULTIMATE revenge meditation: sondheims \\"sweeney todd\\". <br />
B0000508U6|3.0|This is Ernie singing ballads with Bert and the other guys from Sesame Street. I don't know but I can't help it. It does sound like Ernie singing. Close your eyes and imagine.. Maybe Guy Smiley? Help me here. Ernie has always been my favorite. But still good ballads, nice mix and production suited for guys who can't play technically. I like it. I can listen to 2-3 songs on it and then maybe 2-3 songs again next year.
B000059HAI|3.0|the telling of the pearl harbor attack from both american and japanese points of view, this movie was an odd egg in war-weary 1970. the american story was directed by legendary hollywood hack richard fleischer, and the japanese story is vastly more compelling -- putting us (the american audience) in the bizarre spot of *sorta* rooting for the japanese attackers. now while this had been a conscious decision on the part of stanley kubrick in \\"dr strangelove\\" (making us identify with the flight crew about to begin ww3), in this case it was an example of flawed moviemaking. (we can only dream of what this movie might have been had kurosawa not been fired as co-director in the early stages). still, the action sequences are quite exciting, and its sure as heck a better movie than \\"pearl harbor\\". <br />

B000F7CMRM|1.0|there is a certain new-fangled school of screenwriting that thinks that if you put a bunch of characters on screen and have them make no sense of one another but sound as if theyre being profound, then they ARE. the prime example of this in recent years is the abominable \\"crash\\", but at least that was (somewhat) assuaged by strong performances. this -- arguably the worst \\"mainstream\\" motion picture of 2005 -- is redeemed by nothing. an excruciatingly long 2 hours, and as much as i (usually) enjoy george clooney, i might never forgive him for this drek.
B00005JPAM|5.0|I very much looked forward to an excellent performance by Helen Mirren and my wish was granted. I had seen an interview with Mirren in which she mentioned how a photograph of Elizabeth at the age of 12 had served as a catalyst for her interpretation of the role. I'm sure other performances were worth a word or two but I am not able to do them justice. I was saddened that Charles was reduced to a couple of grimaces, afraid of Mum, and forced to try and woo others to implement his wishes. I would rather have seen a more rounded portrayal -- something to balance the presence of Diana. Truth be known, however, I considered the possibility of beautifully shot images of the Corgis worth the price of admission. Unfortunately, for me, the scenes in which they capered or stopped dead in their tracks were scarce. The film seems first-rate. It gives almost everyone a shot at being understood; exceptions being the caricatures of the Queen Mother and Prince Phillip, and puts everything in perspective by revealing the beauty of Balmoral, a handsome stag, and a passel of very polite people I enjoyed watching. If you're wondering about the emphasis on the pups, yes, I have a beautiful Corgi at home who brings me much joy.
B0001ZX0OW|3.0|This film received generally strong reviews and the actors in it have done well over the course of their careers.  So, I gave it a shot. <br /> <br />I wont go into the story or plot line since thats covered in a zillion places.  Lets talk about the actual films execution and \\"unfolding\\". The pace was about right and I felt ample was spent on setting things up. The movie flowed well and the acting was very good...definitely above average.  <br /> <br />I guess what was missing was that little something extra...be it plot related or some type of revelation that kicks the story into high gear. It just didnt happen. The movie just plodded along, never becoming boring, but never becoming very gripping either. Perhaps I expected a little more suspense or tension. It was just follow the murder mystery with little clues or nuances thrown in here and there but never anything exciting. And NO, I dont mean I wanted to see some M. Night Shaylaman stupid twist either!  The ending, while pretty ambiguous and potentially thought provoking was a little bit of a let down, at least in my opinion. I did like how the ending left it open ended a bit and made you wonder what happened afterwards to the characters.  <br /> <br />Overall this film is worth watching but dont expect to see some type of a masterpiece. The reason it averages about 3.5 stars at Amazon is because it is really just an average movie...worth watching but probably not worth owning or watching again.

B000DWMYQ8|3.0|Well, I just saw it. And I wasn't really impressed. So, yeah, in my opinion, this one's a three star effort - but barely. CHICKEN LITTLE is borderline fun and, certainly, one can't help but appreciate and admire the professional craftsmanship that went into it. It's decidedly a rich, visual feast. But, you know what, it left me cold. CHICKEN LITTLE is ultimately a lightweight animated film in need of a heart and funnier comedy. For my money, it doesn't hold a candle to modern classics such as the great Pixar flicks (TOY STORY 1 & 2, FINDING NEMO, THE INCREDIBLES). True, I was ambivalently amused at times, but the only moment where I really had a good chuckle was when Abby and Runt were karaoke-ing to the Spice Girl's \\"Wannabe.\\"<br /><br />Here's the good and the bad. The pluses of the film are the very slick, good looking animation, the vibrant colors of the film, the movie within the movie at the end where the awesome Adam West lends his voice, and the two sidekick characters: the ever ebullient, happy-go-lucky Fish Out of Water and the insecure giant hog Runt of the Litter. The movie's minuses include the boring and, frankly, crappily executed songs, the over-the-top father and son theme (I felt I was pounded relentlessly over the head with the father/son issue, not to mention Abby the Ugly Duckling's incessant prattling about Chicken Little needing closure with his dad), the lack of \\"oomph\\" in the writing, and, to be honest, Chicken Little himself. I can't pinpoint it but I ended up not really caring all that much for the lead character. Maybe the abrasive voice work of Zack Braff has something to do with it. Also, when Chicken Little chose to not tell his dad the truth when he encounters the space ship fragment the second time (and the proof was right there in his room), I promptly slammed my hand on my forehead and growled. I mean, c'mon...<br /><br />So this marriage of a kid's fable with an H.G. Wells classic kind of works...I guess. It's just that, in more capable hands, this  definitely would've come out as a superior product. The strained broad humor, the forced After School Special moments, and the outdated references (who says \\"Oh, snap!\\" anymore, by the way?) did not at all endear this film to me. So, as it is, CHICKEN LITTLE is a guarantee to delight the tots over and over, which is all to the good if what you're looking for is something to divert the young 'un. But, as an adult or even an older child, you'll probably be able to tolerate CHICKEN LITTLE just exactly only once.apable hands, this  definitely would've come out as a superior product.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|I was not a rabid Pink Floyd fan back in their heyday, but after seeing \\"Pulse\\", I have started foaming at the mouth.  Not only are the performances themselves incredible, but the DVD production is excellent. Although the performance is from 1994, I understand David Gilmour and long-time Floyd producer James Guthrie did a lot of work on this DVD getting it just right before they would allow it to be released.  And the attention to detail shows.  The extras are nice, but the main attraction, the  concert alone is worth the cost of the DVD.  The music and the light show are incredible and even if you aren't a big Pink Floyd fan, this DVD may change your mind.  I can highly recommend this to anyone with even just a glancing knowledge of Pink Floyd.  Sit back and enjoy.
B00000K0T8|5.0|After the Wu-Tang Clan dropped their impressive debut with \\"Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers),\\" many of the clansman in the group started dropping solo albums.  The Genius/GZA was the only one to release an album before the group became known with his \\"Words from the Genius\\" record.  But him, Raekwon, Method Man and Ol' Dirty [...] all dropped albums consectively from 1993 to 1995.  Then in 1996 in was Ghostface Killah's turn.  My overall second favorite in the group (and probably the most skilled and lyrical).  His album \\"Ironman\\" was very well anticipated but does it live up to the hype and can it follow the Wu-Tang pattern with all of their previous solid solo and group releases?    1. Iron Maiden (Featuring Raekwon & Cappadonna) - 50+ Second Intro - 4.5/5    2. Wildflower - 4.5/5    3. The Faster Blade (Featuring Raekwon) - Raekwon Solo - 4.5/5    4. 260 (Featuring Raekwon) - 4.5/5    5. Assassination Day (Featuring Raekwon, The RZA & Inspectah Deck) - 5/5    6.

All That I Got Is You (Featuring Mary J. Blige) - 5/5    16. Marvel - 4/5 - After 2 Minutes the track just plays for 3+ Minutes    Overall:    72.5/80    5 Stars    Classic Wu-Tang right here!

Check it out!
B000IU3XTW|4.0|I saw the Foo Fighters on their acoustic tour at the Tower Theater in Philly.. It was really amazing. First thing I did this morning was go out and buy this album hoping to partially relive the music from that night. Now obviously, its a CD, and it could never be as good as the live performance itself, but I don't think this was the best show to reocord and release. This show was one of the first on the tour, and Dave Grohl had even said they were changing things as they went along the tour that sounded better. So anyway to my point, its still an amazing live album, but the performace was not as good as the one in Philly (and probaly other shows for that matter) It could of been better.. but It's still worth every dime of it. I got it at WAL-MART for 8 bucks. <br /> <br />Pros: <br />  Good, Full Setlist <br />   <br />  1hr+ Music <br />  <br />  Not real high priced  <br /> <br />Cons: <br />  They edited out most of the stories speaking parts in between songs <br />  <br />   Left out a few good songs like Still, etc... <br />    <br />   Not too much said in the insert <br /> <br /> <br />
038533348X|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut wrote a number of extremely good novels.  Two of them are truly great.  Cat's Cradle is one. (Slaughterhouse Five is the other)<br /><br />Cat's Cradle treads on some of the same ground as Orwell's 1984, but where Orwell delivers his message with a heavy hand, Vonnegut delivers his message with sardonic wit and sharp insight.  In Cat's Cradle, Vonnegut directs his considerable wit and insight at the institutions of religion, politics, and science.<br /><br />Cat's Cradle is arguably Vonnegut's funniest and most imaginative novel, and also one of his most profound.  It manages to be both absurd and frightening. If you haven't read anything by Vonnegut, Cat's Cradle is a great place to start.  This is an important book; one of the best novels ever written.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|I saw An Inconvenient Truth three times in the theaters and I'm looking forward to getting the DVD to see it again. Of course I think the information on Global Warming is critical and I respect Al Gore for his work in alerting the public to the climate crisis, but I'm also impressed with An Inconvenient Truth as a film. Davis Guggenheim knew when to cut, when to pull back from the slide show and allow some of the shocking information to sink in with the viewer. Al Gore has also really perfected his lecture and presentation over the decades that he's been giving this talk. There are many cases where rather than answering a question, Gore and Guggenheim give the viewer time to arrive at their own conclusions and this is really empowering for the viewer.
0743289412|1.0|I think I may have just about everything SK has written; I am one of those of whom it's been said would buy his grocery list if he published it. I have read all of his books multiple times and have had to buy replacement copies for my tattered favorites. Lisey's Story is one I will not read again. I didn't find it slow, as did some reviewers, it's just that I could not be persuaded to care about either Scott or Lisey. Along with the all-but-constant repetition of nonsense words such as \\"smucking\\", \\"babyluv\\", \\"bool\\", \\"bad-gunky\\" and others (fine if used sparingly, as SK has done in the past), there are characters from other SK novels which seem inserted just to take up space - you greet them not with a smile or nod of recognition but more along the lines of \\"What's HE doing here?\\" It was a slogging, disappointing read and the book could have been half the size without missing much. SK has made me believe in vampires, sentient cars, Fornits, really odd shortcuts, and the possibility of digging up a flying saucer in my backyard - but he couldn't get me to believe in Scott or Lisey.
B00005JNEI|2.0|Ninety percent opinion, ten percent fact.  For more in-depth analysis and much harder hitting investigation based on mainstream media reporting view any of Alex Jones' later films.  9/11: The Road to Tyranny, Martial Law: Rise of the Police State, and TerrorStorm are far better.  Heck, you can view them all for free on Google and YouTube.  Alex is a man so concerned with getting the word out that he releases all his works for free HIMSELF.
B000FQ4M58|4.0|This is a really good Meat Loaf CD but it should not have been Bat Out of Hell 3, it does not live up to the name.  It falls short of that creative spark that would make it a classic like the other 2 previous releases.  I feel that it was hype to sell a few CDs that would not have sold normally, while I really like about 4 of the songs, if it was as good as 1 and 2 it would have had a flow and feel of them and songs that knocked you out the first time you heard them.  Bat Out of Hell 1 was the first CD I ever bought and I thought I found rock and roll heaven, number 2 was slightly less but still awesome, this CD is just a good Meat Loaf CD that should have been released that way, it missed the mark to be Bat Out of Hell 3.  I got to add that song number 4 (Bad for Good) is possibly one of the best rock songs I ever heard (of course you gotta love the way MeatLoaf does rock) , crank it up.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|I know this film seems to get re-released all too frequently and there are a few moans that it doesn't have much more on it each time it gets released (in time for Christmas no less!!). However I only owned this on VHS previously so it was great to watch it again in sharper resolution. I still never tire of this film and it's feelgood message, I'm only sorry that I was in my late twenties when I first watched it (part of my whole \\"I'm not watching that it's in black and white\\" mentality as a younger person). If you haven't seen this before don't be put off by the fact it's old. And do stick with it if you think it's slow starting (as one friend of mine did) this has the best ending to any feelgood film ever!
1932100385|5.0|Don't buy this book if you're looking for the latest fad appearing on the TV talk circuit.  The China Study draws responsible conclusions from longitudinal data gathered from many samples over time. What most impressed me about the China Study is that it reports scholarly and responsible research in an engaging and readable way. And, although not written by or for conspiracy theorists, this work conclusively shows the extent to which our government agencies have been coopted by the corporate elite to mislead the American public on crucial nutritional information.  The title and thickness of this book may prevent many from reading it.  But I wonder how many parents of juvenile onset diabetics would demand some action if they knew that an auto-immune reponse to milk destroys the insulin producing cells in the pancreas and is responsible for most cases of this disease.  And while it's more or less common knowledge that animal fat and animal protien is bad for you, the data from the China Study conclusively shows that we would save many more American lives if we just declared War On Meat instead of on terrorism.  Of course this is the last thing the meat and dairy industry wants to hear so you'll have to find out about the China Study on your own, while you and your kids are bombarded with  industry financed nutritional misinformation. Then too, if the meat industry were not subsidized by your tax dollars, hamburger would be $100 a lb. and we'd be eating more vegetables instead of feeding them to cattle or trying to turn them into auto fuel. Agri-business becomes more profitable while average Americans can no longer afford the medical care many of them will almost certainly need from eating the Standard American Diet.
0618680004|4.0|This book has generated some of the longest-winded reviews I have ever read! I promise to be brief. (I also promise to review the book, not the other reviews.) <br /> <br />I have been a fence-sitter on this subject for some time. This book just may push me into the agno/atheist camp.  <br /> <br />The only thing that keeps my rating from being the full five stars is a perceived stridency of tone in some passages. In the main, Dawkins remains rational and cool, but here and there his emotions peek through. But he states his case clearly and with great force. <br /> <br />By the way, he's also an excellent speaker. If you can't gett to a lecture of his, try one of the \\"Skeptical\\" podcasts on which he has appeared as a guest. They are available on iTunes.
B000FVQM2Y|1.0|I turned this movie off about an hour into it. Another unrealistic teen movie where the characters don't seem to have parents, where much of the filming consists of some schmo slumping around with a camera following him, and where the pace is dreadfully slow. Sure, there was a murder. So what? Slump, slump, punch and kick. Not much heavy dialogue, not much action, at least not to the point where I turned it off. This movie reminded me of NAPOLEON DYNAMITE, another movie I turned off, except that this one's star was better looking and the plot turned around a murder, whereas ND didn't seem to have a plot. I doubt this one did well in the box office; I can't see any reason to recommend it.

After plugging this disc into my computer one night, and watching it, my computer began to malfunction.  I found out through the internet that Sony has been putting copy protection programs on their DVD's and CD's that screw up computers permanently.  I found out later that my CD burning software couldn't back up any of my pictures of documents at all.  I called Sony, and their customer service mentioned it was something that they use to prevent piracy, but apologized for my problems and tried to smooth things over.  After spending $200 for a repair man to fix my computer, I'm back up and running normally.  I will never buy another Sony movie ever again.
B00005JPAD|5.0|I loved this movie. The best movie I have seen in theater in 2006 by a long shot. And what's not to like? Scorsese, Nicholason, Damon, DiCaprio, and Ray Winstone (my absolute favorite actor even though no one knows who he is).<br /><br />Before I start, let me say I have not seen \\"Internal Affairs\\" yet. That is the Asian film that \\"The Departed\\" was based on. I have heard it was much better; I find that difficult to believe, but people say if you saw that one first you wouldn't like this one. Well I haven't, so I am reviewing this movie on its own merits.<br /><br />The concept for the film is really very simple (as most great films are). There is an undercover cop who has infiltrated the mob, and a mobster who has infiltrated the cops. Each one is trying to find the identity of the other first.<br /><br />Watching the film was like watching a chess game between two very skilled players, but what is especially great about the film is how it lets you into the player's heads so you can see their thought process. That's not an easy thing to accomplish. The only film I have seen that was close was \\"Millers Crossing\\" by the Coen Brothers.<br /><br />Scorsese has a tendency to make films about really esoteric subjects. This film isn't like that. As a result I think it is also one of his most interesting movies to watch. It also happens to be the first film he has shot in 20 years that isn't a period piece. That's quite a major deviation for him. I always knew he was a good filmmaker, but sometimes its hard to tell because you just don't know what the heck he is trying to show you (as in: \\"That was probably a tremendous joke that guy just cracked; if only I knew more about the Brooklyn draft riots of 1863 I would probably be laughing a lot right now\\").<br /><br />Scorsese said this was the first movie he ever used digital effects in. He had some digital bullet hits instead of squibs. He said he didn't even know they could do digital bullet hits. That made me laugh. He's Martin Scorsese! How can he not know that you can add in bullet hits digitally? His friend George Lucas created an entire film digitally. I don't think I believe that Scorsese really didn't know that, but it will be really interesting to see where he will go if he starts using more visual effects in his films.<br /><br />Scorsese knows his stuff. He knows the gangster genre probably better than anyone alive so the details of the film were spot on. That's always been one of Scorsese specialties. The clothes, the locations, the accents, the mannerisms, the lifestyles, everything is as real as it can get. Watch it. It's a great film.h. He's Martin Scorsese!

0007218001|5.0|This gifted author weaves a mesmerizing tale around Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer's most famous painting, creating an incandescent and luminous work of her own. His painting is a simple, though enigmatic, portrait of a girl with a pearl earring, about which little is known. The author, however, a born storyteller, creates a living, breathing story around it, using a singular, first person narrative. Told in spare, elegant prose, the author leaps into literary renown with this book.<br /><br />The events in the book are viewed through the eyes of Griet, a sixteen year old Dutch girl, whose changed family circumstances force her into taking a position as a maid in the home of a renowned painter, the taciturn Johannes Vermeer. There, the painter resides with his tempestuous wife, Catharina, their brood of unruly children, his commanding and shrewd mother-in-law, Maria Thins, and their loyal housekeeper and cook, Tanneke. The author lovingly details seventeenth century life in the Dutch city of Delft. It is here that Griet's story unfolds.<br /><br />Sensitive and perceptive, Griet is attuned to the under currents in the Vermeer household and, at first, takes care not to draw attention to herself. Still, she, the daughter of a tile painter, is curious about Vermeer's artistry and is drawn to his work and his methods. Vermeer, sensing a kindred artistic spirit in Griet, draws her into his world of paint, color, light, and beauty, creating an intimacy of the spirit between the two.<br /><br />Still, Griet, a girl on the brink of becoming a woman, finds herself confused and breathlessly desiring more than she may have. Her longing for more than a communion of the spirit with Vermeer is palpable. It is, therefore, not surprising that the undercurrents in the Vermeer household should come bubbling to the surface and engulf Griet, much to her consternation.<br /><br />This is a stunning literary work that fully realizes the promise that the author showed in her debut novel, \\"The Virgin Blue\\". She is an author that understands the less is often more, and she makes every word count. Deliberate and spare, her prose is lyrical in its simplicity, weaving a tale that will keep the reader spellbound. This is historical fiction at its finest. Bravo!The Virgin Blue\\".

B00006CXSS|5.0|This series is awesome, and I am incredibly happy to have it to watch over and over.  It speaks to the depths of the soul of a man.  Having experienced intense pain, though not in war, I find the emotion and the comeradery very intensely satisfying in this series.  This bonding is what men were meant to do, not just in war, but in our every day battles.  The sense of brotherhood among people with only one major event in common is instructional.  I recommend this for any group of buddies, or even church groups.

Today, rap stars capture a narrow, decidely controversial market ... and Rihanna simply doesn't fit this mold.  She reminds me of the amazing talents of Amy Winehouse, another teenager whose voice almost captures the sounds of Aretha Franklin.  When comparing the EVER so catchy SOS, and then comparing it to the dichotomy track A Million Miles Away.  Wow!  It's SO rare to able to choose a single artist on the iPod to get one through both lullaby moments and rock / disco ... sort of reminds me of the rock and roll of Rod Stewart and his Great American Songbook.  I actually asked the dentist the other day to change the CD from Barry (don't ask which one - hint M) to SOS to get my root canal done in double time, then finish me off with A Girl Like Me.  Worked magic! <br />Together with my other favourite artists, Dido, Deep Purple, Rihanna is a WONDERFUL find.  I just HOPE she continues to produce heartfelt ballads and not rap.  Oddly, Dido also got a \\"helping hand\\", NOT that she needed it, from Eminem.  Another contrast!  Go Rihanna, GO GIRL!!!! <br />
B00018D3RI|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite shows from the seventies.  This first season DVD is great and brings back a lot of memories.  I never missed an episode of Starsky & Hutch when I was a kid - and now I realize that this show has stood the test of time with me.  I would recommend this to all fans of the show.  And what until you see the inside packaging!  So cool.  :)
B000H7JD4A|1.0|It was with much amusement that I read Nicko McBrain describe the new music as \\"underground, progressive\\" (how everyone loves throwing that word around) and believe it or not \\"cutting edge.\\" Think of the opposite of those words and there you have A matter of life and death. There is a forcedness about everything they do now, no real passion and while they drop a handful of new ideas in places, it still is quite dismal. I'm sorry to say this about a band I like but they should try harder or pack it in. <br /> <br />
B0000046KM|5.0|Breathtaking.  Simply the best vocal jazz recording I have ever heard.
B000I5Y8ZU|2.0|\\"The Black Parade\\" could have been weirder, and more fascinating, in a good, TV on the Radio, way. In fact, if My Chemical Romance had the talent, and inventiveness, of TVOTR, this album truly would have been, as music guide Blender put it, \\"the Sgt. Pepper of screamo.\\" But, alas, I think a lot of music critics, in anticipating The Next Big Thing, suffered from a case of knee-jerk reaction. Let's see if MCR fans will rave about this album in five years' time, the way fans of, say, \\"OK Computer\\" deservedly do. I suspect not.
B000063V8R|5.0|A partir de &eacute;sta temporada es posible ver a un conjunto de personajes ya muy elaborados y constru&iacute;dos a lo largo de 2 temporadas, que no hicieron mas que repetir un poco a las historias del capit&aacute;n Kirk.<br /><br />  En &eacute;sta nueva temporada,y en adelante, se ve una serie que toma caracter&iacute;sticas propias, problem&aacute;ticas de nuestro tiempo, muy bien proyectadas y razonadas, a tiempos futuros. Es pues, una serie que realmente pasa a ser de aventuras de Sci-Fi a un tratado de Sci-Fi vigente a nuestros d&iacute;as.
B000002AGB|5.0|Many people say you need to get \\"Live At The Leeds\\" to experiece The Who in all their glory. Personally, if you ask this fan, I completely disagree. Now, I greatly enjoy \\"Live At The Leeds\\", but I feel at many times it lacks energy and feels very incohesive and as a whole, yes, I'm going to say it, it's a tad overrated.<br /><br />To truly experience The Who at their zenith, look no further than the two disc \\"Live At The Isle Of Wight Festival 1970\\". Now this is classic Who. As one reviewer pointed out, Roger and Pete are much more focused and energetic than they are on \\"Live At The Leeds\\". Pete's guitar work is nothing short of astounding, and vocally Roger has never been better. The Ox as always plays bass than anyone who has or ever will touch the instrument, and Moon is his wild, over the top self throughout the whole running time, never missing a beat.<br /><br />Every song, including a terrific \\"Tommy\\" set, is full of life and is a sheer joy to listen to. The sound quality is overall terrific, and the liner notes and packing are very well done. This is a highly worthwhile purchase.
0780020685|5.0|I picked this one up mostly because I wanted to see why Directors like Sergio Leone and George Lucas were inspired by this film. It's easy to see why. This is an epic in the same vien as \\"The Last Samuri\\" only it is conciderably better and lacks Tom Cruise which is a good thing. The battles and fight scenes are wonderful. The wet muddy battles looked great on a very nice DVD transfer. The picture looked pretty damn good. I usually am not a huge forien film fan, and I don't usually like subtitles but this movie was so good that non of that bothered me. If you liked The American version of this film, The Magnificent Seven' I deffinetly recomend this. An all time great!
B000002OVJ|4.0|No, people, your eyes do not deceive you. I, Anthony Nasti, a self proclaimed Who fanatic, have deemed their 1970 classic live album \\"Live At The Leeds\\" overrated. This will shock you, and you'll probably disagree with me. \\"Live At The Leeds\\" is often deemed the greatest live album ever made, but while it is no doubt a solid show overall, there are some problems I have.<br /><br />I'll start off with the positives. \\"Live At The Leeds\\", as I said, is a fairly solid representation of the band at their peak. Great performaces of songs such as \\"Heaven And Hell\\", \\"I Can't Explain\\", \\"Happy Jack\\", \\"A Quick One, While He's Away\\" and \\"My Generation\\" highlight this. The sound quality of the recording is very good, and the liner notes and overall packaging is very well done.<br /><br />Now, for the negatives. I feel that the show often lacks energy. The performance of \\"Substitute\\", for example, a regular Who showstopper, is performed in a very slow, monotone and overall boring manner, and lacks all of the excitement of the single version as well as other live performances of the song. Another big problem is Pete and Roger. John and Keith are on fire as always, but the other two seem very distant throughout the whole show. Pete's guitar playing is often quite sloppy, and Roger has been better vocally.<br /><br />While \\"Live At The Leeds\\" is no doubt solid and worth the money, to experience a far more entertaining show by the band at their peak, seek out the two disc \\"Live At The Isle Of Wight Festival 1970\\", which includes many of the songs here as well as an incredible live performance of \\"Tommy\\" in its entirety. \\"Live At The Leeds\\" is quite good, but also not quite what it's cracked up to be,
B0006SSOHC|4.0|Great movie!!!!! It will keep you interested. It will always have you there guessing the next move. A lot of twists and turns. Although it is a great movie the person who created it must of been sick or demented.
B000I5X81K|5.0|For his third studio cd, I found a slight change in his music - more of a classical crossover to pop.  It's brilliant and his voice is as great as ever.  This makes it my favourite of his - while I love his previous cd's, this is a little more appealing to someone like me who doesn't absolutley love the latin classical songs he sings.  He's co-written some of these songs (done a brilliant job) and there is a lot more English 'pop' songs.  He sounds good in any language, but it definately has a little more appeal when you understand him.   <br />My favourites on here are In Her Eyes, Giorno Per Noi (from Romeo and Juliet) and You Are Loved (Don't Give Up).  He also has a great song called Machine that Herbie Hancock appears on.  This is a stunning cd and I really love all of the songs here.  He is as good looking as he is talented and I hope he'll come out to tour Australia sometime soon.   <br />If you are a fan of Josh, then you must go out and get a copy, and if you aren't a fan yet, this might change your mind.  It's fantastic and I really really love it.
B00005JPC7|4.0|\\"This is the story of Harold Crick...\\" So begins what may well be a career altering move for the notorious Will Ferrell. At least we all can hope. Stranger than Fiction is the story of an IRS agent who suddenly begins to hear the voice of a woman he has never met narrating his life and predicting his death. What he will soon find out is that he is the central character of a novel-in-progress that will forever change his life.  <br /> <br />Will Ferrell (Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, Betwitched) plays Harold Crick. This is a character quite possibly unlike anything he has done before. Everyone has become very much accustomed to the utterly ridiculous and more often than not simply obnoxious people he has played in the past. Whether by some divine intervention or other benevolent force, that character has been thrown out the window. With any luck, gone will be the days of Elf and cameos like his appearance in Wedding Crashers. Of course these comedic turns can be fun but in all honesty the true word, as a friend so aptly put it, is \\"gratuitous\\" and for the most part just unnecessary. This new version of the Will Ferrell, with his smart but not over-the-top or high-horse \\"ordinary man in extraordinary circumstances\\" facelift, is vastly preferable to his insultingly in-your-face style of previous roles.  <br /> <br />The supporting cast is also well worth the price of admission. The always brilliant Emma Thompson (Love Actually, Sense and Sensibility) plays the slightly unhinged, as all great authors seem to be, Karen Eiffel, who has not published a book in 10 years. Thompson once again devotes herself whole-heartedly to the role, very believably outfitted as the plagued creative genius. Dustin Hoffman (Meet the Fockers, Rain Man), as literary expert Professor Jules Hilbert, brings a decidedly quirky yet cleverly realistic element to the film. His character is perceptive and practical, although at times very fatalistic, but Hoffman pulls off this contradiction without a hitch. Even the love interest played by Maggie Gyllenhaal (World Trade Center, Mona Lisa Smile), bakery owner Ana Pascal, finds that happy medium between just plain weird and approaching normal. She is accepted because she reflects the reality of how an individual can be made up of so many different parts yet still find happiness within their own highs and lows.  <br /> <br />The film channels I &lt;3 Huckabees and Punch Drunk Love, but even if those two films seemed way too out there to follow, this one is not. It shares the ideas and messages from those films but makes them easier to understand without diluting them or drying them out. It is fun but smart, laugh-out-loud but thought-provoking. Essentially, the tight script and flawless casting are what make the film. The characters deliver their one-liners and soliloquies with finesse. Timing, both on the side of the writers and the actors, really draws the viewer in and keeps them there for the duration. The awkward small talk of the socially inept, the connection made at the recognition of a shared favorite song or the different ways of dealing with the notion of destiny; these are what make the film amusing, touching and revealing. It is interesting that at one point the discussion of literature that Harold hopes will reveal the truth behind his situation turns to whether he is the hero of a comedy or a tragedy, because that categorization can be applied to more than just the written word, and this film catches that, both hilariously and movingly.
B000IU3XTW|5.0|Now, I need absolutely no convincing as to the greatness of Dave Grohl. He's one of my all time favorite artists and it comes as no suprise to me how fantastic this disc is. It's soooo good. Hooray for Dave. It easily lives up to any promise you might imagine. Anyone could enjoy this. So, why don't you? I can't wait for the DVD.
0440217563|4.0|Book number three in the Outlander trilogy, the fantasy historical romance of the time traveling Claire Fraser, has Claire re-unite with her 18th century husband, Jamie, who she left before the battle of Culloden in Dragonfly in Amber.  A time travel trip through the stones is once more necessary and Claire has to leave her beloved daughter Brianna behind.<br /><br />This trip is successful and Claire is now plunged into the complicated life of Jamie, who has survived the battle but now is dealing with the post-uprising difficulties of the Scottish.  While Claire is involved with the difficulties of her re-union with Jamie, there is also a series of mysterious and violent murders in Edinborough, and the kidnapping of Jamie's nephew.  Claire and Jamie sail the high seas and encounter pirates, voodoo and slave uprisings in the Caribbean.<br /><br />This colorful third installment in the series at times seems like it tries a little too hard to have Claire and Jamie caught up in every possible adventure of the time period.  Nevertheless the foundation of the solid characters created and nurtured by Gabaldan weather the slightly torrid escapades of this timeless romantic couple.  One of the new characters is a bit flimsy and caricatured; the giggling, bouncy, foot-worshipping Chinaman Mr. Willoughby.  Although he later proves to be more substantial than his intial portrayal, the appearance of this character is contrived and jarring.  A note I think the story would have been better without.<br /><br />Despite its flaws, Voyager continues the thread of a passionate romance and fascinating premise.  The time travel fantasy is portrayed well--in particular the notion of what one would bring back to the 18th century if all you could carry was in your pockets.  Combining historical romance and fantasy was a genius stroke that makes this series of continuing interest.  Gabaldon's superior narrative, likeable characters and excellent research continue and keep her audience hooked.  In light of the inherent difficulty of maintaining reader interest in a character and premise over three books, this is a highly sucessful sequel.inherent difficulty of maintaining reader interest in a character and premise over three books, this is a highly sucessful sequel.
B000I5X81K|5.0|This is an amazing CD. Unlike his other CD's, this one starts to show who the real Josh Groban is.  <br /> <br />Josh wrote several of the songs and co-wrote with many wonderful artists such as Dave Matthews. In addition, he performs with the likes of Herbie Hancock and the African group Ladysmith Black Mambazo.
0385335989|4.0|In this fourth installment of the Outlander time-travel historical-romance series, our hero Claire Fraser is now a settler in pre-revolutionary Colonial America.  Her story alternates with that of her daugher, Brianna in the 1960's. Brianna is seeking to re-unite with her mother as well as pursue a romance with Roger MacKenzie.<br /><br />Claire is caught up in the day-to-day struggles of pioneer living, and has the dual perspective of 18th century and 20th century technology in her healing practice, though of course not the tools of 20th century technology.  Exposure to the medicinal practices of Native Americans helps supplement her knowledge and pharmacopeia.  Claire settles in to a new stage in her marriage and develops a deeper more stable relationship.  Her daughter's decision to travel in time to see her mother causes Claire and Jamie to relate to one another as parents for the first time.<br /><br />Book four has a more settled feel to it as Claire and Jamie put down roots. Gabaldon does an excellent job of evoking the beauty, sorrow and fragility of life in the 18th century.  The colorful adventures of the Caribbean are behind us though the exigencies of Brianna's relationship with Roger and her father seem a little contrived and overdramatic at times--they seem calculated to cause a more passionate re-union. While this overwrought element of drama was unnecessary, the book on whole works and is a worthy continuation of the Outlander series.  At this point, I still want more!
0152023984|3.0|This is a children's book?  The author has to make a forced landing in a most inhospitable environment, and his new acquaintance, an alien boy who owns a tiny planet, dies in the end of a snake bite.<br /><br />Adults may find some redeeming quality in this book by realizing their self-induced reduction of the wonder and fantasy about life they had as a child.<br /><br />If one ponders the book more deeply, it shows us that we consider things that we have a personal connection with are more important to us than those we haven't made a connection with.  Awkwardly the author says that the people or things that we have connections with are 'tamed'.  The Little Prince felt strongly for the rose that he owned, but cared not for the many he found.<br /><br />The book has a really twisted ending for a children's book.  An attempt was made to suggest that the Little Prince would astral travel in spirit form to his own planet after allowing himself to be bit by a very poisonous snake.  He reminds the author of his(the Prince's) laughter and suggests that whenever the author looks up at the stars, he remembers the laughter.  This might have been a good ending, but the author 'drew' a sheep for the Little Prince with a muzzle that could fall off.  If the muzzle came off, the Little Prince would be horribly saddened because the sheep could eat his only flower.  This leaves the author in a state of anxiety and the book ends with the statement that no grown-up will understand this story.  I found that to be the case for myself.<br /><br />The one thing that I did enjoy about this book is that the Little Prince always kept on asking the same question until he got an answer.  Interestingly enough though, he seldom answered direct questions himself.<br /><br />This review is of the Katherine Woods translation.<br /><br />3 Stars
1878424319|4.0|This book was recommended to me, by my therapist. I think the reviewer before me missed the point totally of this little gem of a book. <br /> <br />The four agreements may seem overly simplistic, however the wisdom they share is often missed by most of us, if ever even thought of. The agreements may sound simple, but for most of us they are very difficult to live out successfully without conscious effort. <br /> <br />Be impeccable with your word, Don't take anything personally, Don't make assumptions, and Always do your best. <br /> <br />These are the Four Agreements. It seems to me that even striving for doing better with these four agreements can only help me. Each person needs to determine their own path in life, to be sure, but what Don Miguel Ruiz has done with his book is to help us,( if we accept the wisdom he presents) live in a healthier way each day. We each must choose what we want out of life. <br />
B000H0MKGK|4.0|There are artists that you've heard of, but have never heard their music. You intend to listen to them, but never seem to get around to it. That's what it was like for me when it came to John Mayer. Then I bought \\"Possibilities\\" by Herbie Hancock and after hearing his collaborative effort with John on \\"Stitched Up\\", I have to admit that I was missing out on a true musical talent for all this time. So when \\"Continuum\\" was released, I didn't hesitate to purchase it. The CD showcases John's musical versatility, superb songwriting ability, guitar playing skills that are right up there with Clapton, and sinuously bluesy vocals. The first few tracks have definite soulful undertones, such as \\"Waiting on the World to Change\\" which is very reminiscent of Curtis Mayfield (when he was with The Impressions). \\"I Don't Trust Myself (With Loving You)\\" is perhaps my favorite while the driving \\"Belief\\" and funky \\"Vultures\\" vie for a close second. \\"Stop This Train\\" is kind of folksy with \\"Bold as Love\\" channeling Jimi Hendrix in true rock and roll style. \\"Gravity\\" and \\"I'm Gonna Find Another You\\" make you wonder how someone of Mayer's age can sing the blues with such seasoned feeling and passion. I must also pay homage to the other two-thirds of The John Mayer Trio - Jordan and Pallidino - because the musical fusion of this threesome adds the spice that makes \\"Continuum\\" cook. So if you've been thinking about listening to John Mayer, don't keep putting it off - you'll be depriving yourself a real treat.
B00005Q4CS|2.0|Well folks, looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here. (\\"Crash\\" comes close, but that film has a lot more detractors than this one, and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined, somehow, that it would \\"change the world\\".)  My beefs are not the same as most of those who don't like the film:  I don't much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse, nor do I find it overly depressing.  Fact is, it isn't depressing at all cause I didn't care.  It's just boring and annoying, sometimes at different moments, sometimes simultaneously.  This not a good combination.<br /><br />All right, here's a plot summary:  Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn all do drugs, and this really messes up their lives. I hate to give it all away like that, but there it is.  The fundamental flaw is this: I don't like any of these people, so their pain doesn't mean anything, and since that is all there is to this movie it absolutely fails to have any sort of effect.  Maybe if Aronofsky had put more time in to characterization it would've worked, but now there just isn't anything there.  As far as what's actually in the movie, we've got  Jared Leto as a stupid chunkhead who has inane conversations with his equally chunkheaded girlfriend Jennifer Connelly, who wants to be a fashion designer, or something.  Beyond this we've got Jared's mother, Ellen Burstyn, who is a weird old woman and Marlon Wayans as Leto's friend who deals drugs with him at times and appears headed towards the big leagues.  I particularly love how there's no real attempt to make Wayans into a person.  He's got one flashback about how he wanted to make his mom proud and that's it.  The doubly sad fact is that he's the most likable of the three.  He at least displays a little life.  Connelly and Leto apparently just wandered here from a Bergman film and are so dull and slow that it's a wonder that the smack doesn't cause them to cease to exist entirely.  (Well, Connelly actually does coke, I think, but it fails to liven her up any.  Also, I actually *like* the Bergman films I've seen, so that's not really a fair comparison.)  They love each other, apparently, but since I don't even like either of them I'm not much interested.  Finally, Burstyn is mostly just creepy though her performance does take a turn for the hilarious as she goes off the deep end.  Perhaps it wouldn't have been funny if I cared about her, but we've been over that...<br /><br />And I want you people to know that I'm not utterly heartless when it comes to movies.  I can care about the characters, but none of these people did anything for me, so the movie's dead in the water.  For good counter examples watch \\"Trainspotting\\", which has drug-addict characters with enough humor and life to be likable and interesting and \\"Bubba Ho-Tep\\", a film which displays the plight of the lonely elderly 50 times better than this film despite being a silly horror-comedy with a mummy in a cowboy outfit in it.  On the other hand, neither of those movies is nearly as pretentious as \\"Requiem For A Dream\\", so watching them will do nothing to stroke your ego.  Still, if that's all you want to kinda find plenty of films better than this one for that purpose.<br /><br />\\"Requiem For A Dream\\" isn't helped any by Darren Aronofsky's repetitive, derivative over-direction.  The trouble is, this movie hasn't got any plot to distract you from how redundant the visual style is.  There's nothing inherently wrong with any of his tactics, but they're hopelessly driven in to the ground, as we see fast-motion a thousand times, quick-cut montages a million times and plenty of wonky camera-attached-to-the-actor junk, and they are, again, impossible not to notice cause the plot sure ain't drawing me in.  I imagine that the overdone, repeating visual style is meant as a representation of the endless cycle found in drug use, but that doesn't make it any more pleasant or entertaining to watch.  The score suffers from the same problem as they use the same handful of themes over and over.<br /><br />Truth be told, I thought this movie was pretty okay for about the first half, but then it really started to grate on me.  It became evident that no, Aronofsky wasn't going to introduce any new visual tricks and no, these characters weren't going to get any more interesting.  I looked at the timer continuously for about the last 40 minutes of the film, and was so uninvolved that the supposedly horrifying conclusion where all the characters really get it bad was utterly ineffective.  It was kind of uplifting, really:  Now that these tedious characters have finally hit rock bottom I can go do something else.  Now that's a good ending.<br /><br />Grade: D+<br /><br />PS This is 500 reviews.  I doubt if I will write 500 more, but who knows?it any more pleasant or entertaining to watch.

B000HWXS2S|5.0|I found out about Amon Amarth went I saw them open up for Children of Bodom last year in concert. Since then, they have been one of my favorite bands, and death metal isn't nessecarily one of my favorite genre's of metal. But anyways, I completely loved the album Versus the World, and Fate of Norns was alright. When I heard they were making a new album and that it was going to the rutes of their older music, I was excited. As soon as I was able to, I preordered the special 2 disc set. When it came in the mail and I popped in it my stero I was beyond believe. <br /> <br />This album is perfect in all senses of metal. It's better than Versus the World in a sense that the music is just as good, but the recording quality is so damn good that you can hear every instrument, all vocals just so good. The melodies and the war-drums and the low growls all combine for an album that is their best work yet. As someone else said, this sets the stage very high for their next album, but I doubt we'll be disappointed. I mean, if the caliber of this album is so high, what can possibly stop them now? <br /> <br />All Hail Oden!
B000IU3XTW|4.0|Its a good live album, but it's not the full set which upsets me. The reasoning behind this is they didn't have enough space to keep all the songs on once disc. So they edited some songs out which kinda of blows.
B000F3TBIO|5.0|A proper gem of an album. Patton's best stuff since California. His vocals have taken on an early Faith No More guise but benefit from 15 years maturity. The album also benefits from a diverse range of collaborators. All the tunes are standout but my personal favourites are the rockin' Massive Attack collaboration -- \\"Kill the DJ\\" (just try and suppress the urge to nod your head!), and the ultra-catchy \\"Don't Even Trip\\". Highly highly recommended for Patton fans in particular. <br />
B000005RU2|5.0|This could be one of the only hard rock cd's you ever need.<br /><br />Fantastic from start to finish, this set shows everything that was right (and excessive) with the music scene in the early 70's.<br /><br />Beyond any rating system
B000IFSDZQ|5.0|This is what a retrospective boxset should be like: all about the artist's artistry.<br /><br />Unlike Bon Jovi good but sometimes unsatisfactory boxed set of a few years back, Sweden's Roxette hit the mark by manufacturing a pleasant and pleasure-guilty expanded collection for the hardcore fans and the casual Christmas buyers.<br /><br />The Roxette set includes 4 cd's made of 99% of their commercially available singles, b-sides, outtakes from all of their discography albums and demos from the vaults, not leaving behind also some favourite album-cuts that never reached the status of official singles.<br /><br />Plus, a very very rare MTV unplugged concert (in full, with an interview with Per and Marie in between the various concert sets)and all of their 37 videos!<br /><br />I personally feel like crowining as this year's most important release.<br /><br />Well worth the bucks you're spending on it...
1401302378|5.0|I just finished The Long Tail by Chris Anderson.  I'm sitting here at my computer in Alaska, writing this review in email, fixing to send it off to the Poisoned Pen bookstore in Arizona, for publication in either the Poisoned Pen eNews or the Poisoned Pen newsletter, to be read by subscribers all over the nation and the world.  And suddenly I realize, owner Barbara Peters is obeying one of the dictums of the Long Tail -- she's letting the customers do the work.  I'm in the middle of a marketing revolution of which I could only see some parts some of the time.  Now that I can see them all and Anderson has explained the cause and effect of them so well, it seems so simple and so obvious.  Down with bestseller thinking!  Trust the market to do your job!  Understand the power of the free!  Order this book now, especially if you are connected in any way to retail sales.  Which, let's face it, we all are.  I particularly love the Kitchen Aide and the Lego stories.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This film is beautiful and highly enjoyable. The adaptation from Jane Austen's novel is very good. The casting was very good. Keira Knightley was an excellent Elizabeth Bennet and she carried the film. I daresay she's one of the most talented young actors of our time. Matthew Macfadyn's performance as Mr. Darcy was a little wooden compared to Keira Knightley's lively Lizzy. But I believe Mr. Darcy himself is a bit wooden so the portrayal is accurate. The lines were delivered wonderfully and I can't help but quote them from time to time. The score is beautiful as well and puts me in a very relaxing mood. I highly recommend buying the soundtrack. I now play it for my 16 month old daughter when I put her to sleep. It helps her to relax and wind down.

As a student of philosophy, with my background being in postmodern theory, there is much in my current and growing [cyber]hypermodernist position that is has actually been influenced by the theoretical simulations that I have constructed in order to help situate my postition while dealing with some of the concepts presented by this album. Computerlove in particular, seems to simulate (perhaps embody) the experience of the real in light of simulation. Like a postapocalyptic prediction, the group situates the protagonist in front of his homecomputer, dialing in for a data-date. The very extistence of such depends on it not-being-real. And yet, our protagonist is deeply and emotionally involved. Very interesting stuff!!!
B000GY729M|5.0|Wow! <br />I expected an amazing album, but The Killers whent past those expectations with their new CD Sam's Town. They keep their old sound and combine it with a new and IMPROVED sound. Definitely a wonderful 80's flashback with a hint of U2. I absolutely LOVE this ablum one of my favorites in my collection.
B00005V0X5|5.0|The 2nd heaviest MegadetH CD right behind \\"So Far, So Good... So What?\\" CD. <br /> <br />Not a bad song on this entire CD anywhere. <br /> <br />Many songs have a very early MetallicA feel to them, well that's b/c Dave wrote the good chunk of very early MetallicA's songs, that he never got credit for.  But that's another story for another time. <br /> <br />Scott Ian from AnTHRaX writes up the review of the CD in the CD cover notes. <br /> <br />Dave writes some after-thoughts of this CD as well in the CD cover notes. <br /> <br />\\"These Boots\\" will not sound the same as it was on the original CD, b/c of the band being threatened by a law-suit from the original songwriter, so the band purposely screwed up the song and bleebed out much of the song to avoid a law-suit and by destroying the song, it was also making a joke and a statement to the original song-writer.  (Dave explains all of this in the liner-notes in the CD cover). <br /> <br />No reverb sound on this CD, which is very nice.  Although there is a lot of reverb sound on the demo songs, but what do you expect?  Those demos are about 25 years old. <br /> <br />You are also going to hear some J.S. Bach Classical Music on here too at the beginning of \\"Last Rites / Loved to Deth\\" song.  Don't freak out and think this is a Classical Music CD b/c the song starts out with J.S. Bach Classical Music. <br /> <br />\\"Mechanix\\" is the same song as \\"4 Horsemen\\" from MetallicA, but with completely different lyrics.  Exact same music, different lyrics.   <br /> <br />\\"This next song can be interpreted 2 ways:  You have our way, and you have their (MetallicA's) way.  Personally, I perfer our way the best.  The next song is Mechanix.\\"  (What Dave said at the beginning of \\"Mechanix\\" on \\"Rude Awakening\\" 2-CD concert set). <br /> <br />You can't go wrong with this CD.  You just can't go wrong with the first 4 MegadetH CDs.
B000002J29|5.0|If you are my age or older (43) and did not hear genesis on your younger years, then this review or the album wont make an impression on you. I lived some of my best music years being young listening to this, there is no more perfet live album than this one, period.<br /><br />One can always point out that Firth of Fith was cut off from the wonderful piano solo introduction we were delighted in hearing in Selling England (Does anyone have the live full version?). Only in this live album does the power of the music come out, should we say that the world needed this album sung by Peter Gabriel too?<br /><br />Back in the 70s I got the chance of seeing the betamx version of the concert, will anyone tell me where can I find the cd? I remeber having the import LP and in the center you could see a photo of the concert with light cones crossing the stage..<br /><br />I hope my teenage son will one day enjoy this album as I did.<br /><br />Is it true that time passes and we pass with it too? I challange anyone to tell me if there is a live abum that has this power.<br /><br />PS- ok, Marillion Garzaladra is close, Rush Exit Stage Left is very close.
0515141429|5.0|I have been reading the Jack Reacher series in random order since reading his most recent, first. This novel, the first one in the series is the best of the lot that I have read so far, with the possible exception of one shot. This is one great read.

B000066I6N|5.0|First of all, if you're expecting Led Zeppelin era Robert Plant-or even the 80's & 90's Robert Plant, you're going to be sorely disappointed with this CD.  These songs are a departure from his previous work and really can't be considered \\"rock\\".  It's a blending of many different types of music that Plant has dabbled with in the past, both in his solo work and with Led Zeppelin.  You're going to hear a stew of Blues, Country, Rock, Middle-Eastern and Modern Acoustic influences here--most of which is done in a style designed to evoke a \\"dreamlike\\" state ( hence the title ).  What you won't hear is a 54 year old Plant trying to belt out hard-driving nods to \\"Communication Breakdown\\" or \\"Immigrant Song\\".  Plant has clearly moved above and beyond trying to be what he was when he was 19.  This is an album for musically mature listeners.  If you're looking for a return to the Glory that was Led Zeppelin, look elsewhere, you won't find it here.  Plant is one of the few aging rockers that realizes how ridiculous it looks when you try to relive or bring back a bygone era.  Overall, a good purchase for someone looking for something a bit different.
B000000HZT|5.0|ok, i do not own the cd, yet in my teens I wore off the LP.<br /><br />I was the time that genesis was not enough for all the music all these guys had,  this cd is being sold with mike Ritherford's Smallcreeps day, talk about a perfect combination.<br /><br />Ok Im remebering my past years, but if you were into prog, this is a unique cd.<br /><br />Afer all thse years, i still remeber that the painting that makes the cover is called Wulluwait, the boatman of the dead<br /><br />PS its \\"Wuluwait, The Boatman of the Dead\\"
B000002NJS|4.0|This album really gets 4 1/2 stars. The reason for the lack of the final half-star is explained below.<br /><br />1. Drowned World/Substitute for Love - This song took a little time to grow on me. It's very simple and slow for the most part but it's meaningful and interesting. There is one part twoards the end that kicks up a bit and that really seals it for me. I really like this track. 8/10<br /><br />2. Swim - A nice catchy toon. The overall sound at times is similar to other tracks on the album. But between the tracks it sounds like, this one is one of the stand-outs. The lyrics are interesting too. Not a amazing song but not a bad one either. 7/10<br /><br />3. Ray of Light - There is a reason this was picked as a single. It is fun, upbeat, and catchy! This is by far the most \\"fun\\" track on the album. It is very much a sing along song that is one of the best on the album. 10/10<br /><br />4. Candy Perfume Girl - This is one of the tracks that is similar to Swim. I think the distinct difference in the lyrics and overall message keep it fresh though. It's not a bad track, not a stand-out one but not horrible either. 6/10<br /><br />5. Skin - A good track. Madonna's vocals are pure and pretty. It's still nothing amazing but nice. A very \\"trance\\"-ish track in my opinion. 7/10<br /><br />6. Nothing Really Matters - Another single, again I know why they picked it. It's very catchy and more dance oriented, second only to Ray of Light in that area. It's a shame it didn't chart well in America. But it's a very good song, the lyrics are simple but the overall sound makes up for that. 8/10<br /><br />7. Sky Fits Heaven - This one took a while to grow on me as well. Lately I'm really enjoying it. Very nice and simple. 7/10<br /><br />8. Shanti/Ashtangi - Firstly one has to give credit to Madonna for doing a  song in another language. Especially the one this is done in, sanskirt. Very fun and pretty. One of my favourite tracks on the album! 9/10<br /><br />9. Frozen - Simply haunting! The music on this is chilling and really captures the title of the song. The lyrics are simple yet powerful, the same goes for Madonna's voice. Very beautiful song! 10/10<br /><br />10. The Power of Goodbye - Simply stunning! Probably my favourite track on the album. The lyrics are again simple yet very pretty and many can relate. It is a song that can bring up past experiences and old emotions if one lets it. Very moving and Madonna's voice sounds fantastic! 10/10<br /><br />11. To Have and Not To Hold - A very good track overall. Very calming and simple. I find this song to very \\"sing along\\" as well. Great! 9/10<br /><br />12. Little Star - I think Madonna went a bit over the top with the lyrics to this song. In that I mean she went too far with this new-age introspection she tries to present on the album. But the production is nice and it's not a horrid song by any means. 5/10<br /><br />13. Mer Girl - This song is more \\"beautifully\\" spoken than sung. It's like a poem set to music I'd say. Not the best song on the track but nice. 7/10<br /><br />Overall this album gets 8. It's very beautiful overall. It's good for relaxation and introspection. I will admit (as explained on Little Star) Madonna gets a bit too \\"serious\\" at times and I think she tries to \\"sell\\" us on her new image at other times. But the album isn't fake by any means. Overall it's a very decent and solid effort by someone who(at the time) was trying to grow and mature as an artist.>9. Frozen - Simply haunting!

B00005V9IL|3.0|For me, the last twenty minutes or so ruins 'The Abyss' (Special Edition) for me. Up until that point, the film is fantastic, with characters to care for courtesy passionate performances (though they resemble the likes of Cameron's 'Aliens' crew a bit too closely), an intriguing and mysterious setting, and an underlying anxiety that kept me riveted the whole time. But then, the end comes. <br /> <br />I'm a huge James Cameron fan, and he is, by all means, one of my very favorite Hollywood directors. That said, his apocalyptic message of peace, which seemed much more apt to the tone and storyline of the 'Terminator' films ('Judgment Day' especially, who's domineering theme of a Human driven end-of-the-world is set from the get-go), just seems tacked on and, worse, pretentious in 'The Abyss'. Its birth comes way out of left field; considering the rest of the film is so intimately confined to the crew and its personal dynamics, with the nuke idea helping propel the plot but surely never hinting at the \\"second-coming\\" finale, it all just comes off as some sort of desperate attempt at self-importance. Yet, because the film is so captivating up until this point, not to mention uncommonly moving from an emotional standpoint, I really can't see why they thought such an overwhelming expression of a theme was necessary. Sure, when the mysterious underwater creatures are asked by Bud \\"why didn't you do it?\\" (in reference to their actions taken towards Earth), and the response brings up a demonstrative visual of Bud's message to his wife given towards the conclusion of his sacrificial act of dismantling the nuclear warhead  -- something along the lines of \\"It was a one way trip, but you know I had to do it. Love you.\\" -- I tear up for a sec, but that moment of poignancy just doesn't justify the rest of the overblown spectacle in the concluding (many) moments.  \\"It hurts us to see you hurt each other.\\"  OK... maybe you should help us with some sort of advanced technology, ratherthan state the obvious; surely we haven't all been killing each other from a collective, sadistic will, so maybe you can help improve our dire situation.  No wait, you'd BETTER, for now that you've let us distasteful Humans know of your presence and location, we're just gonna bomb you suckers beyond the abyss.  But, then again, none of this could really play out, because the film's already at the two and a half hour mark; thus, I don't think 'anything' could have played out with credibility after the real story here is over, and ultimately Cameron's conclusion doesn't evade that. <br /> <br />It's just so unfortunate, too.  I mean, at least for me; obviously not everyone seems to have a problem with the film's ending.  But, it's unfortunate because 'The Abyss' is so dang good before it rapes itself (too harsh?).  From a purely Human standpoint, its Cameron's best film, and yet it still manages to provide awesome scenery and environments, with the beautifully choreographed action that every single one of his movies possess.  And it's all substantial to character and plot; there's no real filler here.  The last act in the film (before the bogus thirty minute extravaganza) is so phenomenal, with such convincing, powerful dramatics, it in itself ranks amongst even Cameron's very greatest cinematic moments.   <br /> <br />Almost never does an ending so negatively affect the rest of a magnificent film for me, but 'The Abyss' is distinct in that.  It's also an awesomely distinct film otherwise, adding more pressure to the wound.  Ah well.   <br /> <br />Oh yeah, Michael Beign is pretty stellar here.  His career sure went down the toilet, didn't it?  I mean, he was (is?) acting in video games for a decent amount of time -- geez.  'The Abyss' marked the end of his companionship with Cameron (not that that was a huge deal, given Cameron's only done *3* films since -- how disappointing), but man, you'd think he would have been able to do fine on his own, based on his performance in this film and his two prior with the director.  Just a thought.
B00005JPBJ|4.0|Jigsaw (Bell) is back, although still dying from cancer.  With the help of his assistant Amanda (Smith), they enlist the \\"help\\" of Dr. Lynn Benton (Soomekh).  They connect her to a devise around her neck that will blow her head off if Jigsaw's heart stops.  Properly motivated, she begins to try to help him.  Meanwhile, Jeff (Macfayden) is going through a series of tests in which he faces the people responsible for his son's death and must forgive them.  After all, Jigsaw just wants people to appreciate life. <br /> <br />It's Halloween, so there must be a new \\"Saw\\" movie out, right?  In fact, \\"Saw IV\\" is already scheduled for 2007.  \\"Saw III\\" lives up to its predecessors, and even manages to tie up some loose ends.  Flashing back to points in the first two films, the makers of this movie are able to make things fit a little more tightly.  Tobin Bell is good as the mastermind Jigsaw, and the rest of the cast is good enough as his pawns.  The death devices are still fairly clever this third time out, and there are enough twists to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat.  If you enjoyed the first two \\"Saw\\" films, there is no reason not to check this one out. <br />
B0000029GA|1.0|I bought this CD trying to get into the east coast sound. Big mistake, all the tracks sound a like is just a long bore.  I miss Tupac Style song...California love, I anit mad at cha... those are great song..
B000002UJQ|5.0|It took a few times listening to this album to begin to appreciate it, but once I did, oh boy!  Radiohead is an acquired taste for sure, but I'd recommend this as a first try for anyone interested in this band.  I've heard other bands that try to mimic Radiohead, like Muse for instance, but why go for a copy when you can get the original.  Good stuff.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|<br />I'll make this short and to the point. I think \\"The Open Door\\" is a very solid effort all around. It starts out very strong, the production is great, and Evanescence sounds as good as ever musically. Very solid 2nd effort all around.... <br /> <br />The only complaints I have is that a lot of these songs sound the same after a few listens, and as a whole they don't seem to run together as well as they did on \\"Fallen\\". Oh well, all things considered it's an enjoyable listen, and an admirable effort. I hope to see them live this year!!!.... <br /> <br />
0743289412|4.0|I've read almost every SK book in print, so when this came out of course I got it.  I think it's a decent book, but just seems to miss the 'oomph' I've come to expect from Stephen King.  I was captivated by the characters Lisey and Scott, as well as the other worldly Boo'ya Moon.  The only thing wrong was that this story really didn't grip me.
B000IU3XTW|5.0|When I first heard that Dave and the boys were releasing this live album I wasn't really that interested. Now don't take this the wrong way, The Foo Fighters are probably my favorite band of all time. The reason I wasn't interested is because in my opinion the Foo have overdone the whole acoustic thing in the last few years. Since the incredible phenomenon that Everlong became after Grohl played it on Howard Stern with just an acoustic guitar, the Foo Fighters have really embraced the unplugged sound. In fact, their last cd was a double disc that included something of an entire \\"acoustic\\" cd. Couple that with the fact that many of these songs have been played acoustic (Everlong and Times Like These were actually released as singles) and the rest are relatively acoustic to begin with I wasn't that excited. Oh how wrong I was! This isn't just the Foo, they've added more musicians (including Pat Smear!) and even some backing vocals. Every song sounds absolutely beautiful and often nothing like the original. Many people have talked about Marigold being on here, but just as shocking and incredible to me is Friend of a Friend. I'm surprised he played that one. Skin and Bones is a new song and it's really really fun. However, I have to say that February Stars is the highlight of this album. Incredibly beautiful. I'll stop ranting now, please pick this up soon. You won't regret it.    P.S. I have one major complaint. Why not perform Aurora!?!?!
B000002J27|5.0|Here Collins takes the helm.  At this point Genesis is still firmly entrenched in it's prog rock roots, so there's alot on this disc to enjoy for any prog rock or Genesis fan.  The first track 'Dance on a Volcano' is probably the strongest track, with a toss up between Entangled and Robbery as the weakest.  The song 'A Trick of the Tail' is a good story oriented song, the kind that drew me to Genesis in the first place (read Gabriel era music).  Good album, go get it. <br />
B000I5X81A|5.0|Cale is one of the major influences on the post-1970 Clapton Sound. Although he, (and BB King for that matter), are doing all right on their own, an EC collaboration is always a good kick start towards acquiring some new listeners. Hopefully this is a trend: How about Eric and Delaney?
0060752610|5.0|Anyone reading up on investment subject will eventually come across this book and so did I. Reviews of the book on Amazon was hugely positive but many regarded it as a bit dry. This book, I heard, was one of the ones very highly regarded by `Warren Buffett'. When I got the book, it did seem bulky and with lot of numbers. Nevertheless I sat down to the task of reading through it and I am so glad that I did. <br /> <br />The book is a lot about investment philosophy and investor psychology but is also the cornerstone of the principle of `Value Investing'. Anyone who does not realize the importance of investor psychology is eventually doomed to failure. As a whole, the price of securities in the market is largely driven by emotions, the emotions of the investors and Wall street. Hence this book is a treasure in itself. <br /> <br />Graham clearly elucidates the difference between `Investing' and `Speculating' and cautions the the wannabe investor against several pitfalls. The importance of not acting by emotion but by logic is highly illustrated. He agrees that this is easily said than done but I am glad I understand this through his advices rather than eventually through experience. The principle of `Margin of Safety' is a wonderful concept that personally, I think, is timeless in itself. <br /> <br />The concepts and ideas in this book are invaluable to anybody who wants to be a serious investor. Quick money never lasts. I have to add the downside to it also here. The modern Tech industries are very difficult to evaluate by the value investing concepts. This is primarily due to the fact that for a lot of the Tech industries, the intangible assets are lot more than tangible assets. Hence the difficulty in computing actual value exists at present. But I have to assert here that this is no fault of Graham but it is rather due to changes in Market Conditions that did not exist during his times. <br /> <br />In summary, I have to say that I greatly enjoyed this book. It was not a bit dry (as some people had said). It is one book that proves that basic principles never die and it definitely is a treasure cove of knowledge and ideas for any investor.
B000I5X81A|5.0|This is a terrific CD! Ever since I heard the first single on radioplay, \\"Ride the River,\\" I've been waiting to get my hands on the CD - and wasn't dissapointed.<br /><br />A really great retro sound - somewhat laid back, stripped down.<br /><br />The guitarwork is excellent - has that Marc Knoffler guitar picking sound throughout -<br /><br />A few of my favorite cuts include \\"Danger,\\" \\"Last Will and Testament,\\" and \\"Ride the River.\\" Its got bluesy cuts, rockers, ballads - a very welcome teaming from two guitar masters responsible for some of Clapton's best early solo work ('Cocaine,' 'After Midnight.')
B0000069Z6|5.0|It isn't often that a movie is able to capture the charm and delights of being a child.  Usually the adults attempting to make such a movie are unable to find the magic that lives in the hearts and imagination of children.  The makers of \\"The Snowman\\" had no such trouble.<br /><br />This movie is about a young boy ... a day in the life of a young boy.  This likable lad builds himself a snowman, and he loves it very much.  That night, at midnight, the snowman magically comes to life, and the two of the them ... the boy and his snowman ... embark on a series of adventures together.  These adventures start small but soon escalate into some very daring (and heart-warming) escapades ... with the final adventure being the sort of thing kids the world over dream about.<br /><br />\\"The Snowman\\" begins with a bit of live action and a brief narration, but after that everything is animated and there are no voices ... no speaking parts at all ... just background music.  But this background music is excellent ... very well matched to the action taking place.  And the animation is very good ... warm and comfortable to the eyes.<br /><br />I think the enduring charm of \\"The Snowman\\" comes from the purity and innocence of the little boy's thoughts and feelings ... and also from the love and caring that is shown by the snowman.  These things give the movie a fullness and a richness ... and make us take the film to our hearts.

B000A7Q2DM|1.0|I'd rather be stabbed in the face than listen to any amount of work that this band releases.
B000002JQ6|4.0|This is the single disc version of AC/DC live release in 1992 recorded on the popular \\"Razor's Edge\\" tour.  This song take the best song of the original 2 disc version of this live set.  This disc provides a good snipit of the full picture, but hardcore fan would be rocommended to spend the couple bucks extra to get the two disc version.  Regular fans, this has the live songs you could be content with, the biggest ones.  So enjoy this piece of AC/DC history. Don't forget about the Bonfire box set for a good collection of Bon Scott era live recording.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|I had heard a few friends talk about this movie, but none of them told me what it was about, and since I rarely watch television, I had not seen any previews, so I was not prepared for the storyline. Had no clue what this movie was about.<br /><br />That being said, I have usually liked the movies Keanu Reeves has been in, even though I never thought he was a great actor. I do, however, love Sandra Bullock, so I figured I'd probably enjoy this movie for those reasons alone.<br /><br />But I was to be pleasantly surprised when I watched this movie and realized a couple of things 1) Keanu Reeves has really 'grown up' in that he actually acts decently in this movie, and he doesn't have that young feel to him anymore. 2) The storyline was really quite good.<br /><br />About halfway through the movie, I had already figured out one part of the ending of the plot, which disappointed me, but didn't surprise me, because, as a writer and editor, I am trained to 'figure out' those surprise endings. However, that being said, while I had figured out one part of the ending, I had not actually counted on the way it DID end. I went through more than half of the movie thinking, \\"He's going to be the one that was...(left out not to spoil the surprise)\\" But then to find out that it wasn't exactly how I figured it would happen, well, let's just say I like being surprised like that.<br /><br />I was very impressed with the movie. Excellent date movie! Highly recommended.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|0kay. Maybe this CD isent what you would call \\"Punk\\". But who cares. It is an awesome cd. There is not one song on there that i dont like. My Favrites would have to be \\"Im not Down\\" \\"Clampdown\\" \\"Death or Glory\\" .. If you like the clash. you will like this CD. and if your one of those people that call yourselfs \\"punk\\" and dont like this CD just because its doesnt sound punk. get over your image. and listen to the words.This is a great CD.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|Lets be honest, Three Days Grace isnt the \\"most talented\\" band out there. But they do more with what they have than any other band I know. In fact, this CD could be the best release of 2006, honestly. I am a huge music fan, metal, rock, etc...but this CD is a perfect example of a band fulfilling their potential. <br />  \\"One X\\" is MUCH more mature than their self titled release and overall a better album. The first one is great, dont get me wrong, but this is SO much more mature and Adams voice now, both live and on this CD is much improved. I would name the stand out tracks, but there are no fillers on the CD, so it is not needed. In fact, the 2nd single \\"Pain\\", while good, might be the weakest track on the album. It's got my vote for top 5 albums of the year, and if you guys havent seen them live in the past 2 years or ever, check them out, they have improved 10 times over.
B000002I27|5.0|This in my opinion, is the Doors greatest achievement. However it is hard to love any one of their albums anymore than the other. So i'm not gonna call it my favourite, they all are timeless, and breathtaking, but this album, i think, is not only mesmerizing but its finale \\"when the musics over\\" describes brilliantly the shape of Mother Earth is in today.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|Meat has delivered a 14 song monster of an album. Steinman or no Steinman, who cares? stop living in the past and evolve a little!,Meat sings his guts out and Marion Raven is hot!!!  Buy the album, listen and shut the Hell up!!

Not that it wasn't interesting, but I had a hard time ever reading more than two chapters at a time...then I might go days without picking it up. <br />That being said, I still enjoyed it. The plot does progress a little, and we do get insights into characters that we haven't gotten them from in the past. <br />I am in this series for the long haul. I'm looking forward to the next entry. <br />

Given it took a while, but this CD was well worth the wait. <br /> <br />My Favorite tracks are, You are Loved, L'Ultima Notte, So She Dances, In Her Eyes, Un Giorno Per Noi (Romeo E Giulietta), Lullaby, Weeping, Verita (Bonus Track), Smile (Bonus Track) (which is on the Internet-only version) <br /> <br />Ten of sixteen tracks, hmmmm, the other six are very good as well. <br /> <br />Now Josh just needs to put out a Christmas CD and all of us Grobanites will be in soooo much happier then we already are, at least I know I will.
B000GTLQXU|2.0|When word that Wolfgang Petersen -- director of such fantastic films as DAS BOOT, ENEMY MINE, and THE PERFECT STORM -- was slated to direct the remake of THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE (now shortened to simply POSEIDON), the sizzling hype around Hollywood was immediately palpable. Production costs for the heavily CGI-laden film skyrocketed to $160 million, making it one of the most costly films of 2005 (released in 2006).<br /><br />Adding to the costs was an ensemble cast starring Josh Lucas (GLORY ROAD), Kurt Russell (SKY HIGH), Richard Dreyfuss (MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS), Emmy Rossum (THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, 2004), Freddy Rodriguez (LADY IN THE WATER), and Kevin Dillon (24 TV Series).<br /><br />Now The Poseidon Adventure (1972) wasn't that great a film to begin with, but what it did have was a catchy tune sang by Karen Carpenter (\\"It's Got To Be The Morning After\\") and a great human story surrounded by a terrible event: the capsizing of a cruise ship. Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons, Roddy McDowall, Shelly Winters, and Jack Albertson rounded out that all-star cast. And although the production was a bit cheesy by today's standards, it held at its center a tale of human determination and sacrifice. This was the focus. The destruction of the ship was just the catalyst, not the focal point. Which is where Wolfgang's remake encounters significant problems.<br /><br />The character set-up in Poseidon is rushed, never giving the audience a sense of empathy or angst for any of the people onboard. More film time is given to the CGI water, fires, explosions, and other non-character items. Many times during the film we are yanked away from the characters in order to watch yet another explosion happen somewhere on the ship, then we're jerked back to the characters who don't really respond to it. So what was the purpose of showing the movie-watcher these things? The simple answer is because it was CGI, it was cool, it cost money, so you have to show it in order to justify your budgetary expenses.<br /><br />Since we're given so little time to understand or appreciate the characters' interactions with one another, when one of them dies there's no impact for the viewer. Most will probably say, \\"So what\\" when this person or that gets snuffed out by the expensive CGI water, fire, or explosion.<br /><br />Hollywood needs to learn that it's the people in the film audiences care about, not the \\"totally awesome\\" special effects. Sure, directors/producers can put the CGI in there and make it look nice, but it has to have an impact on the characters.stify your budgetary expenses.  <br /> <br />Since we're given so little time to understand or appreciate the characters' interactions with one another, when one of them dies there's no impact for the viewer.

B000IU3XTW|4.0|First off, this CD is really low priced during the opening week, there is no excuse not to pick this up, even if you are a casual foo fan.  A good collection of the foo fighter songs spanning thier entire career reworked and placed on this cd for your listening pleasure.  I was not real thrilled with in your honor, but this makes up a bit for that, due to the quality of the older work placed on here to make up for the newer material.  This album still has some thunder behind it, along with it's really soft parts also.  Dave Grohl is a great musician, and hopefully this will further bolster his reputation amongst the future greats in rock and roll history.  Pick this up, you will like it.
0195067142|5.0|This is a brutal, horrific first hand account of combat on Peleliu and Okinawa from the experience of a front line Marine. Better than Tregaskis in my opinion. Read this book if you want an insight into the motives of modern man in front line combat and what inspires such bravery and fortitude as the troops engaged in combat in the Sth Pacific in WW2.<br /><br />Very difficult to put down I imagine this would be a valuable companion for a historian's tour of the two Islands concerned.<br /><br />I dare say this would be worthy of a read for someone contemplating joining a combat unit, even in today's world.
B000002HJA|5.0|This is a must have. Anyone who enjoys rock is going to love this album. Here is the first album that encompasses it all - awesome jamsongs, heavy rockers, mellodic tunes, songs that bounce & bop, EVERYTHING rock. Did I mention that there's a ton of profanity? <br /> <br />     Kyuss was completely unique. There was never and will never be another Kyuss. Queens of the Stone Age are good, but Kyuss was great. Fu Manchu is probably the closest band to Kyuss that I can think of; they still have there own thing, though.(They've had some of Kyuss' ex-members, too) <br /> <br />So, about the album. <br /> <br />'Hurricane' starts the album off with a punch, sockin' it to ya. I could just imagine the crowd going wild. Opening with a cymbal crash into a drumstart, the pace quickens, guitars sweep you away into a sea of distortion, you're hooked.  <br /> <br />'One Inch Man' has this trippy/hypnotic start that then builds into a grungy, heavy chorus, once again featuring the overblown guitar sound. For some reason it seems like the song's speeding up as it goes along. Aural illusion, I guess. <br /> <br />'The Ol Boozeroony' takes you on a sonic adventure that only Kyuss could have planned. There's an almost middle eastern guitar sound, which is once again hypnotic. <br /> <br />'Gloria Lewis' starts like an 'Imperial March'. Just turn your speakers up and let them knock stuff over. There's a slow fade at the end. <br /> <br />'Phototropic' - almost an instrumental, my favorite track by Kyuss, not just my favorite on the album. Starting slowly with guitar only, the drums and bass come in and bam, you're moving. Turn off the lights and crank this one way up. You WILL actually start feeling euphoric while listening to 'Phototropic'. This is probably THE reason you need to buy this album. <br /> <br />'El Rodeo' - Here's what I meant about the bounce. There's a resemblance to 'Money' by Pink Floyd for the first two minutes. Picture the opening bassline, but with a mid-eastern inspired guitar phrase. When the lyrics hit the similarities to 'Money' are gone, but they're not trying to be Floyd, it's just my comparison to give you an idea of the sound. <br /> <br />'Jumbo Blimp Jumbo' seems to have this Hendrix inspired guitar lick to it. Almost 'Voodoo Chile'-esque. This one picks up some speed about halfway through. Maybe another sonic illusion. <br /> <br />'Tangy Zizzle' - I just love the name of this song. I don't know why. Great song, sound, etc. Anti-establishment, anti-conformity, rocker. <br /> <br />'Size Queen' - Sonically amazing, this song has swagger to it. No shenanigans here.  <br /> <br />'Catamaran' - My other Kyuss favorite. Catamarans are double-hulled boats. You get the feeling of drifting along a lake. This song by itself is a good enough reason to buy the album. <br /> <br />'Spaceship Landing' is not the last song on the album, but let's talk about it. At eleven minutes, it's an epic. You'll never even notice the time, either. 'Spaceship Landing' goes through a few changes of pace and you'll be there for all of them. <br /> <br />You might wonder what I mean about it not being the last song, but 'Spaceship Landing' is on the eleventh and final track. At 11:15 the song ends, but the track keeps going. So, at about 14:48 there's a thirty second thing that I don't even know what to call. (It's not a song, but just someone messing around with vocals.) However at 32:14 into the track you get a \\"hidden song\\", 'Day One'. <br /> <br />\\"...And the Circus Leaves Town\\" is the best Kyuss album. Songwise, \\"Wretch\\" is the next best. Wretch offers you some great tracks like 'Son of a Bitch' and 'Big Bikes'. Sonically it does suffer from the early-album syndrome, but honestly it just has a more raw feel. With such a short catalog I'd say just get all four studio albums from Kyuss. <br /> <br />Enjoy. <br /> <br />
0767020308|5.0|It's just like the book.  Kate as Emma, well, it's great, you really hate her at the beginning.  She just makes you feel.
B0006IIKS0|3.0|for two decades they have been one of the biggest heavy metal bands of all time, selling more than million records since 1981. They have won many grammys in the rock catergories & this rockumentary is a look at what group therapy means as James, Lars & Kirk begin the recording their new album \\"St. Anger\\" while going through therapy, going through feuds & looking for a new bassist to replace Jason Neusted & look back at moments in the band's history. It's an intense & entertaining rockumentary, a film that defines anger music, a very well done rockumentary, a must see for Metallica fans or for metal fans. This is not a concert film, this is not behind the music, this is something else.
B00005MP58|5.0|It's a bit too long.  I know it's a mini series, but they should have cut a little bit.  However, lizzie bennet is great in her role, and Mark Darcy, well, he's a dream.  specially in disc 2, when he is supposed to be more relaxed.  JUST LOVE COLIN FIRTH.
B00000JG41|5.0|Mr. Bungle had their self-titled album, which was very strange but catchy in a weird way.  Then they released \\"Disco Volante\\" which was a true mess... but was still brilliant.  Then, to complete the album trilogy, \\"California.\\"  This album is the most pop-sounding out of the three, yet still bounces around and throws genres in a blender.  It's definitely the Mr. Bungle album I would recommend first, even though I started with the self-titled album.  There's great stuff to be heard on this disc.
0393327655|5.0|\\"The End of Faith\\" by Sam Harris is a book I believe every American should read.  It is a very well written book which clearly describes the contradictions between Religion and Reason in our society.  It also points out how much influence the hypocritical religious right has on our country's government, which is quite frightening, actually.  Hopefully a large number of people will read this book and over time the American people will realize that we have to work towards truly separating Church and State, which was supposed to be one of the founding principles of this great nation.  Great read, very well written, I definitely recommend it to anyone...
0671799320|3.0|Daniel Yergin certainly writes well and has a good eye for a telling anecdote.  This profile of the oil industry offers an important perspective on 20th century world history, and it highlights numerous entertaining characters.  Although the book provides solid insights into the Middle East, it always presents a westernized (big oil company) perspective.
B00004Z400|5.0|For a long time, I never really could get into the Deftones.  I even saw them live at Ozzfest a long, long time ago, and they still didn't leave an impression on me.  And, in my teen years, I went through this horribly immature anti-numetal phase, which didn't exactly help.  So, with a few years, and a bit of growth, I got to the point where I thought I might like this album if I gave it a chance, but I kept putting it off, thinking \\"Eh, I'll get to it someday\\".  And now, having finally gotten around to it, I find myself in the oh-so-familiar position of kicking myself for letting my prejudices, or whatever stopping me from enjoying some really great music.  But enough of my life story already. Let's get to the album.<br /><br />I previously used the term \\"numetal\\", which is commonly affixed to the Deftones, and to a certain extent it's accurate, as they were one of the founding bands of that scene.  However, I would say that this album in particular hardly constitutes a numetal album at all.  There are maybe one or two songs that might fit that categorization, but that's it.  Otherwise, the album is very ambient and experimental overall, with some nice electronic touches to add a cool sense of eclecticism.  Chino's vocals are a bit of an acquired taste, but they are unique, diverse, and pretty damn cool.  Also, Abe Cunningham is an absolute groove demon of a drummer, and pretty versatile as well.<br /><br />As I sort of mentioned before, this album is full of diversity.  You've got heavier tracks, like \\"Back to School\\", \\"Street Carp\\", and the purely psychotic \\"Elite\\", and more laid-back and subdued tracks, like the incredibly hypnotic \\"Digital Bath\\" (one of my favorite songs and song titles), the techno-tinged \\"Teenager\\", and \\"Passenger\\", which features none other than the mighty Maynard James Keenan on vocals.  \\"Pink Maggit\\" is epic and haunting, with a reprisal of the \\"Back to School\\" chorus to add a nice bookending effect, and \\"Change (In the House of Flies)\\" alternates between crashing choruses and creepy melodies.  Every song here is distinctive, and great.<br /><br />I really can't believe I've taken so long to finally come around to this album, and this band.  Now I can't stop listening to it, and am really looking forward to hearing the new album, \\"Saturday Night Wrist\\".  Gotta look into some Team Sleep as well.<br /><br />But hey, better late than never, right?\\" alternates between crashing choruses and creepy melodies.  Every song here is distinctive, and great. <br /> <br />I really can't believe I've taken so long to finally come around to this album, and this band.

B000HIVO64|5.0|i have literally been listening to this work for a week straight.  when i get in my car, i turn it on.  when i'm at home, i put on the DVD and watch it over and over and over again.  it's brilliant.  it's sick.  i'm wondering if there is some sort of Scientologist subliminal messaging going on or something.  why can't i stop?  how can one work be so addictive?  since the second that i heard the first note, i knew that this was something incredible.  EVERY song is amazing.  who cares who invented what, or who did what first.  sometimes it's the person who rediscovers something, and puts a new spin on it, that makes it more relevant and powerful than it might have been in its previous incarnation.  Beck's translation and redefining of these genres brings rap, folk, and electronic music to a sublime level that has never been reached before, by any of their founding fathers.  Beck is the pale horseman of the mundane music apocalypse; The Information is a product of music's re-evolution.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Michael Buble does a great job on his interpretation of some great popular tunes.
B000F7CMQ8|3.0|Mogambo sees the King ending his reign at MGM with a solid, albeit heavily reworked, remake of Red Dust. This time round Gable's a great white hunter in Africa trapping animals for zoos and circuses, but the mixture is much the same as before, albeit shot on location with a little less spice. Ava in the shower doesn't generate the heat of Harlow in a barrel, but at least she's the real deal compared to Grace Kelly's mannered turn as a rather unappealing bad tempered wimp (maybe he just has a thing for faux posh totty?). John Ford's direction is curiously anonymous: without his screen credit, I'd never have guessed he was the director in a million years. If anything, it feels more like a middling Richard Thorpe or Jack Conway film, but either way it's pure MGM all the way- a well-cooked steak, but no sizzle.     The transfer is good, though there are a few inconsistencies due to the master material available. The only extra is the enjoyably over the top original theatrical trailer.
B000GFLKEY|2.0|The acting was very good. The pace was adequate. However, the plot was predictable. The movie just reeks of the intelligent thriller syndrome. Clive's character kept calling this the perfect robbery. The characters talk about the relative intelligence of the other characters or how the other characters can't possibly know what is going on. I'm still not sure what Jody Foster's character brings to the plot.      Any way, they do stupid things. The bank robbers dig a latrine in a storage closet. You don't know the hole is a latrine until the end of the movie. However, they do call it a \\"s--thole during the movie. They spent hours on this hole. Why couldn't Clive's character use a bucket with chemical treatments instead of a hole in a floor of a bank for a latrine? They even brought buckets in with them because they were disguised as painters.     Finding plot holes in this movie is like shooting fish in the barrel. Furthermore, the plot is so predictable that it made the movie drag. I have to be honest, I didn't guess the ending. I kicked myself for they gave plenty of clues. For example, a big one is the title of the movie. However, the lame clues (the s--thole) acted like red herrings. They threw me off the scent.
B000001DTM|1.0|This was the end of U2 that I loved - and I was a fanatic - and still am a fanatic of the 'early U2' (ie. I still own and enjoy everything - and I mean everything - before Actung Baby). It was obviously a business decision (and a very successful one) for the band to go in this direction but what a musical disappointment. The story for U2 pretty much ended here ('Vertigo' is the main exception). 'One' is the only great song (up there with the best U2 songs) and the only reason I still keep Achtung Baby. The rest is boring dance crap or just plain boring. I can't think of another rock album in history which is so massively overrated. Then again why bother trying - I'd rather get another beer and put on 'I Will Follow', 'Streets Have No Name' or even 'Another Day'.
B00005JNS0|4.0|First let me say this is a ***** 5-star movie, it is the single disc DVD that reduces it by a star.  But wait....<br /><br />Yes, there are 2-Disc versions of this classic-to-be Pixar movie, but the \\"powers that be\\" are making you look for them!  Only certain U.S. retail store chains have gotten them and their second discs are different, so you have to buy them all to get all of the extras.<br /><br />Even the acclaimed Australian 2-Disc DVD doesn't have all of the extras that are on the U.S. retail stores second disc.<br /><br />Why Buena Vista decided to market this movie this way can only mean a real 2-Disc version will be made available to everyone next year after their exclusive contracts expire.
B000I5X81K|4.0|I am a huge fan of Josh's first two CDs and I expected to love Awake too; playing it quite a few times puts it close to love, but more like appreciation for the things he's experimenting with and some of his collaborations.<br /><br />In my opinion, without (for the most part) the guiding hand of David Foster, Josh seems more experimental here.  He's kept the orchestra on most songs, but the piano-driven melodies of [[ASIN:B0000CFW87 Closer]] aren't as prominent here.  Josh also has more songwriting credits than before.<br /><br />Of the 13 songs, 8 are in English this time, and those 8 seem to me to be more \\"radio friendly\\" than some of his past work, \\"You're Still You\\" excepted.  Of those 8, the collaboration with Five for Fighting's John Ondrasik (\\"February Song\\") is by far the most likely to be a radio hit.  The omission of the title track is ridiculous; I would have given up two of the other songs to make room for it.<br /><br />For me, the weakest part of this CD is the selection of a couple of songs that seem totally out of place here, even if this is a \\"new\\" Josh.  \\"Lullaby\\" with Ladysmith and Black Mambazo and \\"Weeping\\" with Ladysmith, Black Mambazo and Vusi Mahlasela are awful.  They both seem like fragments of a song and I still can't figure out how they fit into the theme of this CD.  The one excellent collaboration is \\"Machine\\" with the fabulous Herbie Hancock.<br /><br />I wish I could say that every song moved me, but that's not the case.  I've grown to like \\"Mai,\\" \\"You Are Loved,\\" \\"February Song,\\"\\"Ungiorno Per Noi,\\" and the fun \\"Machine.\\"  The other songs leave me with the feeling that something's missing.  They don't seem passionate, they don't really have a hook and they don't feel like any of the songs on Closer or his self-titled CD.<br /><br />There's no denying that Josh has a remarkable voice (I would let him sing the alphabet and love it), but I'm not sure I like some of the production and arrangements.  Maybe I just miss David Foster's constant presence.  I'm still a huge fan and I'll absolutely pick up his next CD.  I think Josh himself said it well when he said something to the effect of hoping that no matter what the song, when someone hears it, they don't think, well, that's an interesting song.  They just say hey, that's Josh.<br /><br />I'm hoping next time around, there is more of Josh and the oddly uneven song choice isn't repeated.and I'll absolutely pick up his next CD.

B000IU3XU6|5.0|This CD is like starlight on a very dark night. It's got just the right touch of romance and wonder. Josh Groban is definitely my favorite artist, and this is his best work to date. He showcased a range that is remarkable by singing   Spanish, Italian, South African, and American classical and pop music, and by singing higher notes than he usually does. He also co-wrote several of the tracks on this CD, which also demonstrated that he is a wonderful musician and poet. I am so proud of him.
0618551050|5.0|Given the diversity of opinions and thorough accounts already available on Smolin's new book, one cannot disregard that adding some original or unforeseen impressions to what already has been said has become a daunting task. <br /> <br />The book is centered on the theme of telling \\"the story of a quest to understand nature at its deepest level\\". The reader will, however, get much more than a simple story. As Smolin calls it, it is something like a \\"tragedy\\". Although he prepares the terrain, for some readers it might still have an unanticipated taste, specially in the last part of the book. And it is a well-written tragedy, told with genuine honesty, competence and undeniable lucidity, by a reputable scientist, who has innumerous and well-known contributions to quantum gravity, ranging from highly technical works to popularization articles. <br /> <br />The book is divided into 4 parts: <br /> <br />- The Unfinished Revolution, where he identifies five problems that any quantum theory of gravity must address in its ultimate form, namely: the problem of quantum gravity per se, the problems in the foundations of quantum mechanics, the problem of unification of particles and forces, the problem of explaining how the values of the free constants of the standard model of particle physics are chosen by nature, and finally the cosmological problems, like dark matter and dark energy. This part is mostly devoted to give a historical (and personal) account of how these problems have been and are being tackled in theoretical physics. It is carefully written, in a clear and pleasant style, quite accessible for the laymen. <br /> <br />- A Brief History of String Theory, a very readable review of the history and present status of string theory, and his critical account of the main technical problems of the theory. For fun, should be compared with Greene's The Elegant Universe. <br /> <br />- Beyond String Theory, a bird's eye view on other approaches and research programs to quantum gravity, the new experimental hints that are beginning to emerge from these studies, and a personal view on the \\"original and impatient mind[s]\\" behind the scene of these new proposals. Also, a review some recent phenomena unantecipated by string theory is also given. In my opinion, this part is the only one that really would benefit from some improvement on its arguments. One could have the impression that the present alternative approaches to quantum gravity were all born out from somewhat \\"crazy\\" ideas. In fact, even though some of them can be seen as highly unconventional, these ideas are currently developed at a high level of mathematical rigour and offering valuable physical insights and some first predictions. Some of the alternatives to quantum gravity are already at the point of being seen as coherent and formal independent research lines. Of course this part is used as argument for his thesis on the need to make risks in science (see below), but one might end up a little confused on the true status (pros and cons) of these alternatives. Yet, it is still a nice birds-eye view of them and an opportunity for the reader to learn on their existence. <br /> <br />- Learning from Experience, an exceedingly original and thought-provoking account of what is science, how it works, and what can be done to change the current state of affairs. In my judgement, the best part of the book. <br /> <br />One thing that is important to point out and make it very clear: Smolin is not claiming that string theory is completely wrong. The main thesis of his book is simply that string theory, as it is currently developed, can be seen as a canonical example of a style of doing science that is wrong. But it is not the case that he thinks it should be put to an end. I think he is clear enough on this matter throughout the book. <br /> <br />Another concurrent thesis that Smolin puts brilliantly forth, and which cleared up my comprehension on several personal issues regarding what the scientific activity is all about, can be summarized below: <br /> <br />    \\"Theoretical physics is hard, not because a certain amount of math is involved but because it involves great risks.\\" <br /> <br />A good strategy to do science right, therefore, involves diversity and the willing to take risks: without them the scientific activity gets corrupted and dominated by sociological phenomena. Lee Smolin offers plenty of reasonable evidences along his book that this is the case for string theory. But Smolin also offers a possible cure for the problem and actually defends it throughout some parts of the book: <br /> <br />    \\"To keep science healthy, young scientists should be hired and promoted based only on their ability, creativity, and independence, without regard to whether they contribute to string theory or any other established research program.\\" <br /> <br />And there are obvious things that, although obvious, sometimes hide unexplored reasoning inside them: <br /> <br />    \\"The truth lies in a direction that requires a radical rethinking of our basic ideas about space, time, and the quantum world.\\" <br /> <br />Clean enough. But to get in the right direction, things will necessarily have to change. The book is an intelligent discourse over simple and undeniable true statements such as this, and makes it very compelling from the consequences that can be draw from them. <br /> <br />As I pointed out, the last part of the book was the one that interested me most, since it is dedicated to a fascinating reasoning over what is science, and I think it could even be subsequently explored in a separate, modern treatise on this important and timely issue. <br /> <br />I would like to end this review with a few words that come from someone highly unconnected with the scientific community in the US and Europe, and whose major area of competence is Astrophysics. It has to do with the fact that Smolin do raise questions of general validity, as I could directlyrelate to my own experiences. <br /> <br />Before reading Smolin's book, I believed that it would offer me interesting arguments for believing that there was indeed a trouble with string theory. But actually it turned out that it offered me also a vision of science of an unforeseen nature, and hit me personally in an unexpected way: I found out that he was addressing some of my personal views and doubts, of course from his own perspective and wisdom, but it was like talking to an old friend who followed my own career in science and understood what troubled me most for all those years. So this book is for you if you want to be challenged over your own vision of science and how you fit in it. <br /> <br />I am absolutely impressed with Smolin's book and, I should say, alleviated. The reason is simply because Lee Smolin wrote the kind of book that I always thought it was of upmost importance to be written, yet for some reason it seemed that no one was willing to write it; a kind of book I could never write myself. But then, after so many years (at least to me), here it is. <br /> <br />There are some important elements in Smolin's thesis that should be carefully studied. My personal belief is that most of his arguments sound painfully true. In years to come, I have little doubt that this book will be recognised as a very important contribution. Even if someone else does not think that way, or even if the book proves itself \\"in trouble\\" or even wrong in some places, it must be applauded for its timely and wise words. I think this is much needed these days, in any discipline of science. <br /> <br />Smolin's book is now placed on my shelf besides the books that I believe are in the same class: Cosmos, by Carl Sagan, The Selfish Gene, by Dawkings, Gödel, Escher and Bach, by Hofstadter, and The Road to Reality, by Roger Penrose, amongst few others.
B0002NRRAG|4.0|While Billie Holiday's voice can be heard throughout, each song is done in a new Peyroux kind of way. The album is fantastic for a rainy day, for a long drive, while cooking dinner, or as ambient music. You will find yourself listening to it again and again, and humming the tunes throughout the day. Easily a favorite for those that love the slow classy jazz.
B0002W4SWC|1.0|This Pride and Prejudice fan was hoping for a modern-day movie with a storyline much closer to Pride and Prejudice.  Even Colin Firth could'nt save this one for me!  On its own I found it sadly lacking in just about everything I look for in a romantic comedy including romance and humor.   If you are a true Pride and Prejudice fan, I recommend buying the BBC series and the 2005 movie version.  Both are excellent.  I would'nt waste my time again with this one.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|The 'facts' that Gore are dated, discredited and in some cases, downright fraudulent. Do your own research and you will see that this is the case. An overwhelming number of scientists that DO NOT have a federal grant or research dollars at risk do not agree with the conclusion of this film (I just can't force myself to call it a documentary...) Don't waste your time with this propaganda and attempt to get you to agree to even MORE taxes!! <br /> <br />If you want to see a worthwhile documentary, see TerrorStorm by Alex Jones.
B00006M183|5.0|Riot Act should have won album of the year!  Although listening to the album 4 years after it was originally released, I am so glad I got back into Pearl Jam.  I have not listened to Pearl Jam since high school--I can't believe I deprived myself for so long!  Pearl Jam is the best rock band of my generation.  Hopefully, they will stick together and put out several more albums down the road.  For those of you not sure if Pearl Jam still has it, trust me THEY DO!!!  Buy this album, you will be in for a pleasant surprise...

B000002I4S|4.0|In this Coltrane's classic record, three songs help us to put it in perspective. First, \\"Naima\\", a sont that will be played by Coltrane all his career long, showing his deep feeling in a melodic way, easy to approach for the beginner and to compare with the many versions of it recorded by him. Second, \\"Giant Steps\\", where the long 'sentences' and the armonics still remind the be-bop days, as if Coltrane were leaving that period. And third, \\"Mr P.C\\", where Coltrane shows his future 'shaken' way of playing, using a structure of two consecutive notes, high and low, up and down, each of them following a diferent line but, by this 'lateral playing', opening between those two lines an empty and free space where the melody is heard without being played. This is the Coltrane what will be found later in his marvellous album \\"My Favourite Things\\". <br />As well, in this record, Coltrane is forgetting that 'deadpan' jazz who followed the cool period. Always without falling in sentimentality, Coltrane starts to fill that free and open space of his music with feelings. What is trully amazing is how love made him rebellious, and how it showed him the way to push modern jazz out of its ensconced position. <br />To finish: don't miss \\"Countdown\\", a burst of technical power.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Race car Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) has had a fantastic rookie season and could easily become the first rookie to win the coveted Piston Cup.  All he has to do is win the run off race against veteran The King (Richard Petty) and perpetual runner up Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton).  If he can do that, he might be able to get a new sponsor.  After all, being the spokescar for Rust-Eze is a little embarrassing for a sleek racecar like Lightning.<br /><br />On the way to the big race in Los Angeles, Lightning accidentally gets separated from his transport truck and finds himself in Radiator Springs, where he accidentally destroys the road.  Much to his dismay, he's sentenced to repave the road before he can continue on the way.<br /><br />Radiator Springs is the town that time forgot.  A former way station on the famous Route 66, it is barely surviving now that the big interstate has been build nearby, making stopping there no longer necessary.  Of course, this is exactly the type of town Lightning wants to avoid.  He's living life in the fast lane and just wants to get on his way.<br /><br />But to complete his community service, he has to deal with the locals.  Mater the Tow Truck (Larry the Cable Guy) quickly labels Lightning his best friend and wants to help him have a good time.  Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) is cute and distracts the rather single focused Lightning.  In fact, everyone in town seems to enjoy having Lightning around.  Everyone but Doc Hudson (Paul Newman).  What kind of secret might he have?  And will Lightning take what he is learning to heart?<br /><br />This movie might bore kids.  More so then other Pixar films, the main conflict is internal, focused on what Lightening is learning from his experiences in Radiator Springs.  There is a villain, but he gets little screen time.  And this is the first movie to not have on of Pixar's patented climaxes that will not quit.<br /><br />All this isn't to say that the movie is bad.  I saw it twice in the theater, and loved every minute of it both times.  The story is ultimately heartwarming, the characters endearing, and the movie is funny.  The tractor-tipping scene alone is guaranteed to make you laugh.  Plus there is lots of fun during and after the final credits.<br /><br />And then there's Pixar's attention to detail.  Watching the car's backup lights turn on and off or the bugs being VW Beetles, for example, add to the charm.  The animation in the movie is flawless, and many of the scenery shots are absolutely breathtaking.  If I didn't know better, I would say they were real.  This is a movie to watch on the big screen for those shots alone.<br /><br />Surprisingly, this is the first Pixar film not to get a two disc special edition.  Frankly, I find that disappointing.  Still, the movie looks and sounds wonderful.  There's a new short with Mater, deleted scenes, and the \\"One Man Band\\" short that showed in theaters before this movie.<br /><br />While kids might not find it as engaging as Pixar's other films, they will enjoy it.  The lack of extras is disappointing, but the film more then makes up for it.  This is another triumph for Pixar.in the theater, and loved every minute of it both times.

0596007124|2.0|I didn't make it through the whole book, but still:<br /><br />I found the examples that constitute the bulk of the book to be very poor. The main problems, I think, are that they don't really explain the design requirements and they don't give you a reason *why* anyone would be solving the problem in question. In some cases, I think they're solving contrived problems that no one would ever want to solve.<br /><br />Consider the the factory pattern chapter. It's centered around a Pizza class that has methods such as bake(), cut(), and box(), and I have trouble imagining that anyone would want to make such a class -- maybe because baking, cutting and boxing seem to be inherently *physical* actions, whereas computers are generally involved in the *non*-physical. It might make *some* sense if they claimed they were trying to build a control system for a pizza-making robot, but I don't think they do. I doubt this pizza-making robot interpretation would make sense of the rest of their class hierarchy, but maybe.<br /><br />In the introductory chapter, they discuss a hypothetical pond simulator, which simulates behaviors of various types of duck. This is more obviously something one might want to make on a computer, but they never give enough detail. What is this particular pond simulator designed to do, for instance? How does it work? How would the user interact with it? They have you analyzing a Duck class and its subclasses, which have methods such as quack(), swim(), display(), and fly(), and that would be all well and good, except they don't discuss when the simulator would call these methods, what their particular responsabilities are, or how they are to interact with the rest of the simulator.<br /><br />Tangentially, I would add that I found the pictures of attractive women to be distracting.

1932100660|5.0|If you had asked me a month ago to pick my favorite book of the last decade, I would never have imagined picking a scientific book of nutrition studies.  But I would now.<br /><br />I am a serious skeptic of most food studies, supplements, fads, and the half-dozen or so nutrition books I've yawned my way through. What makes this so different is he produces such compelling data.  I love the way he provides references so I can chase down particularly astounding facts when my skeptical instincts kick in.<br /><br />Two things to know about this book:<br /><br />1.  It really isn't about the China Study, fascinating as that is.  Only one chapter is devoted to it.  The publisher chose the title and it is, unfortunately, misleading.<br /><br />2.  You ask yourself over and over while reading it, \\"Why haven't I heard about this before?\\"  It makes so much sense, Dr. Campbell is so widely published and respected, and the claims are so bold...  He dedicated section IV to this question. The answer is as compelling as the information he presents on the link between diet and the diseases we all fear.<br /><br />Now that the book is selling so well, my guess is beef, dairy, and drug interests are going to do anything in their power to cast doubt on it--and they have a lot of money. I think that debate will be very healthy, so to speak.

0743289412|4.0|Two years after her husband's death, Lisey Landon is finally getting around to cleaning out his study.  Scott Landon, a renowned and respected author, died tragically and too young after an illustrious, award-winning career.  As Lisey delves deeper into the writings and memorabilia in the boxes snaking through Scott's study, she finds herself assaulted by a flood of memories spanning their 25-year marriage.  Before she can get too far, though, one of her sisters has a mental breakdown, and she receives a creepy phone call from a man calling himself \\"Zack McCool,\\" who threatens violence if she doesn't turn over Scott's writings to a certain college professor who's been harrassing her for them.   <br /> <br />While all of this is going on, Lisey begins discovering clues throughout the house that seem to have been left for her by her dead husband and which appear to be leading her on what Scott would call a \\"bool hunt\\" -- and she knows exactly where she'll end up:  in Boo'ya Moon, the world Scott created to escape from a horrific and violent childhood.  It is a world that smells like frangipani and paradise, where the moon is four times the size of our own, where food turns poisonous after sunset and strange, dangerous creatures stalk the woods at night.  Something in Boo'ya Moon stalked Scott for his entire life, a \\"longboy,\\" a creature with a piebald side -- and now it's put its mark on Lisey.  She'll need help from her sisters and from her dead husband if she has any chance of surviving Zack McCool -- and any chance of defeating the creature that haunted Scott's days and nights. <br /> <br />I docked LISEY'S STORY one star because the stream-of-consciousness prose was a little too Virginia Woolf for me, a little too confusing and messy at times.  Everything else was perfect.  I mean it -- perfect.  In LISEY'S STORY, King has struck the perfect balance between horror and love.  This is a novel that's hard to classify, so those readers who seek to pigeonhole King maynot be totally pleased with this outing.  The horror here is more cerebral than in most of his books, and so is the love.  There are moments of pure brilliance in the prose, statements that make you draw in your breath when you read them.  This is a love story unlike any other I've ever read, one that reveals both the \\"light and dark hearts\\" of a marriage. <br /> <br />And King brings us to the interior of that marriage in what I believe is a truly ingenious way:  through the language of the marriage.  He peppers the novel with words unique only to Scott and Lisey, like \\"bool\\" and \\"SOWISA\\" and \\"puffickly huh-yooge\\" and, most prominently, \\"smuck\\" and all its variations.  This seems to have turned many people off, judging from some of the other reviewers here, but I absolutely loved this element of the book.  What marriage doesn't have an interior language all its own?  I know mine does.  King's inclusion of Scott and Lisey's secret words really brought me inside their union -- really made clear to me the incredible connection between husband and wife.  I think it's a brilliant tactic. <br /> <br />The novel took a few chapters to draw me in, but I was completely invested by the time I reached the end of Scott and Lisey's incredible, strange love story.  I don't think there's any author writing today who can match King's creative ability or his knack for making his worlds come alive.  All of the characters in LISEY'S STORY felt so real, and reading about them evoked real emotion in me.  I kept closing my eyes, imagining when I opened them I'd be in Boo'ya Moon.  It sounds silly now -- but King just makes you believe.  I was definitely impressed with LISEY'S STORY, and I'd definitely recommend it. So SOWISA -- Strap On Whenever It Seems Appropriate -- and give this non-traditional Stephen King book a try!
055357342X|2.0|Besides being overly long, basically going nowhere that would signal any end in sight, and his love for describing what everyone is eating in great detail(Book 2 it was clothes, this time it's food) George Martin seems to be going out of his way to make his novels unreadable.  Sure, he has technical skill with language and can string a sentence together pretty good.  But he's got nothing to say, which is why he makes noise for over 1100 pages or whatever.  And what does he have to show for it?  Basically, in the end, his worldview seems to be....the mean crush the good, there is no honor in this world, and everyone is vile and wretched.  There are no heroes and truth is only demonstrated through a use of power, and power is only weilded by those who would kill a child or rape someone without so much as a blink of the eye.<br /><br />First of all, his thesis is as inane as one that posits that everything in the world is roses and rainbows.  His story is so overwhelmed with heartless, evil characters that it literally is no world I know or have ever been in.  It really is fantasy, cause its so damn implausible.  His characters are wooden and so one-sided in their darkness(except for a few of course, but he keeps killing them....by the end of Book 4 they should all be dead).<br /><br />Secondly, Martin seems to have missed the reason people read fantasy or anything in the first place.  It's entertainment--how can it be fun when every character that had any depth or interest is killed off?  At this point, 3 books in, I care none for any of the living characters...so why keep reading?  I don't care whether they live or die.  The two that I would consider giving a care about, well by now I just think they are dead men walking so I don't bother to worry about it.<br /><br />All in all, a lot of promise, but nothing on the delivery.  The genre seems to have devolved into 1000+ page mega-schlock--stories started full of promise that end up just being excuses to make anotherbook for more money by artists of limited skill whose worlds and sagas are too large to control.  Perhaps it's the genre that needs the change, maybe this style of story is doomed to fail precisely due to its lack of vision and conciseness.  Martin and Jordan should get together and talk to each other till they both collapse of boredom.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I admit at first viewing this movie, I saw Betty, Naomi Watts initial character, to be a literal character and not someone in a dream Diane was having. In other reviews here, that is realized. It's a little disturbing to see it that way, but we are all dreamers, and sometimes the way we would like to be or think we are isn't the way others see it. Our internal world is vast and much more relavent than our outer selves, though I agree there should be balance between the two with a certain level head to reality. Mulholland Drive is purely a dream and then a disturbing \\"reality\\". It's beautifully done. Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring were the right image and voice. They are another way to see the way we are sometimes, whether we are male or female, our internal world is both, and this really displays another side of us for us to understand. I really care about Betty in this movie. I admit there is a side of me that has come to understand that my way is sometimes the same as hers. It goes with trying to understand ourselves. She has all this energy to give to others, and an honest trust in anyone. We never grow up, it seems. Laura Elena Harring's character is that side of us that goes on, clueless to the past and stuck to present circumstances. It's devastating to be brought to wonder \\"who am I?\\" after all we've known and been through. If you can understand this much, you'll take a lot from this movie. I looked up Roy Orbison's lyrics to Crying. A good touch to the story. Overall, this will leave you wondering why God made us so desperate for heaven, or clueless to it. I believe it is true that David Lynch put his heart into this. It's so much to care about. And the soundtrack is excellent. Pay attention to the music to see when you watch.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Josh Groban continues to wring a healthy variety of emotions from the listener with his new CD, \\"Awake\\". With his last album, \\"Closer\\", being such a quantum leap forward from his first effort, I feared that \\"Awake\\" couldn't possibly live up to those expectations. No worries here! From the foreign-language \\"Mai\\", which sounds like the perfect show-opening song for his next tour, to the haunting, moving \\"February Song\\", Josh once again not only proves his musical range with a new album, but also with the varied musical styles within the album itself. While I'm not a fan of African music, the two tracks here, \\"Weeping\\" and \\"Lullaby\\" work for me simply because of Josh's vocals and devotion to each song he sings. And \\"Machine\\" is a great showcase of Josh getting a little funky and soulful! My only complaint, and it's a minor one: there are a few passages throughout the album where it feels almost as if Josh was holding back in his vocals rather than pouring more raw feeling into the lyrics. Having attended two of his 2004 tour dates, I know he can really \\"belt it out\\"! But again, he does know how to move the listener with both his vocals and the instrumental arrangements, so this could be just a personal take on the songs themselves. Overall, a definite worthy successor to \\"Closer\\". NOTE: The album is \\"Awake\\", but the actual song \\"Awake\\" is only on the limited edition as a bonus track! Buy it, as this song (and the other bonus song) is worth the extra $$!!

B00005JKED|5.0|What I was most impressed with with this movie was the commentary by Antoine Fuqua. It is the perfect introduction to someone whose voice clearly shows that this is a man with a caring mind. On the contrary, I have done enough drugs (I'm now on anti-psychotics) that I believe we lose that voice the deeper we go into it. I'm out of touch. This guy simply wants to do his job, and I'm not sure he'd want anyone discussing whether or not he cares about people, but honestly, I think he knows it enough to set an example for people before they decide to make the mistakes I did. That is what he does extra. He didn't have to set an example, and we need people to come to terms with the problems drugs create. Sometimes we don't know these things until it's too late, after we ourselves have made the mistake of doing it. I've been in and out of the hospital for suicide attempts after hearing voices and finally wrote a novel that may publish. I have a lot of faith in the story, which is full of metaphors to my life, and I'd like to share it with people. It's emotionally charged. I believe people in this line of work agree that that is the route we need to go. I applaud the creators of Six Feet Under for their efforts in that, and of course after watching Training Day, my head turned in a new direction. All of it caught my attention and brought me to want change in my life so that I could bring change to others. I honestly felt closer connected to these people. I describe one of my lead characters in my novel as a sort of Ethan Hawke, and I did identify most with his character in this movie. Antoine deserved recognition here if through his work is the only way. I would imagine many people who know him take to his warmth, his honesty, and the charm he has as someone to care about, someone perhaps other than him who struggles. To be connected to people in that way is not an easy path. I don't have an easy mind to it, but at first glance I admit it seems important. I guess I can say this much: I didn't have the right friends to know what I was doing wasn't right, and to see someone who is doing the right thing really changed me. We are lucky to have these resources because in instances like this, these people are a true help. Before the suicide attempts, I had no friends because I was out of school and out of work. But if you're interested, I go by the author name Ian Bradley and am planning on publishing my first one soon. Editing is finished. Look for me sometime. Who knows, maybe I'll come back in touch with people and speak my mind enough that I may share what it is about and what meaning there is to take from it. Again, great that Antoine Fuqua worked with this story, it was great to watch, and the people in it in all their efforts really is admirable. I wish people wouldn't just go to be entertained. It's so ignorant of the larger picture. We need serious guidance. I would venture to say that it is God who graces us with men like Antoine. He has a strong personality and values that seem to match that. Good morale.his much: I didn't have the right friends to know what I was doing wasn't right, and to see someone who is doing the right thing really changed me.

0451529308|5.0|Set during the Civil War, \\"Little Women\\" is the story of the four March sisters. Meg, the oldest, is sixteen and very much into being a \\"young lady\\". Jo, fifteen, is the exact opposite of Meg, a tomboy who hates everything girlish. Beth, thirteen, is a homebody, always cheerful and looking at the bright side of things. Amy, the youngest, is loving but a bit selfish and shallow. The March's don't have much money, but they are rich in love and that love carries them throughout the course of \\"Little Women\\" which takes place over a span of ten years. The March's have many adventures as they grow up, several of them with their next door neighbor, Teddy Laurence. There is joy and sorrow in their lives, but the love they have for each other carries them through everything.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is old fashioned, sentimental but not too sentimental, and a wonderful book to read. The book is partially autobiographical, based on Louisa May Alcott's own sisters and the love she had for them is evident throughout the book. There are heartbreaking parts which make me cry each and every time I read \\"Little Women\\", yet there are heartwarming and comical moments that make me smile every time I read it. The four March sisters are very realistic, even Beth, who is almost too good to be true. Alcott was an imaginative writer who could make inanimate objects, such as roses, seem alive. \\"Little Women\\" was originally written in two parts and Alcott's style changes a bit in the second part, as she addresses the reader directly and at times delivers little \\"sermons\\" to her readers.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is a delightful book for readers young and old.

B00005JNTX|2.0|I am a big fan of Frank Miller's work and I loved reading the graphic novels the movie was adapted from. When I saw this film I was blown away by the visuals. It had an amazing graphic style that was very different than anything I had seen in a movie before. <br /> <br />Having mentioned it's good points I have to say I was enormously disappointed with the dialogue and some of the story adaptation to screen. It seems to me those involved in the screenplay and production were too concerned with adapting this in an overly faithful manner from the graphic novel to the big screen. For the most part the bad dialogue and some of the terrible acting in parts were just too painful to sit through. I had to keep checking to see if my ears were bleeding yet. <br /> <br />Each extraordinarily bad line or horribly acted sequence made we wince like I was being mugged. What works in a graphic novel doesn't necessarily work as well when adapted directly to screen without a bit more adaptation than you'll see here. All the characters were severely and tragically 2-dimensional with none of the depth you get from reading the graphic novel and very little attention was paid to developing better dialogue suitable for a big screen experience. Also, many of the big name actors in this movie were capable of much better performances than they displayed here. <br /> <br />Purists and rabid fans of the graphic novel may be capable of somehow finding a way to look past all the terrible acting and awful dialogue that is rife throughout the film. However, my bottom line opinion is it's a good film to watch for the visual look only, but you will almost certainly enjoy it far more if you keep the 'mute' button on. This film had the potential to be truly great but it is extremely disappointing that it fell so far short of that mark.
B00005JOQS|1.0|Well, after almost 20 years of no superman on the big screen, this is how he returns? He should have stayed in space looking for Krypton(one of the many ridiculous plot points of the film). This film is calling itself an homage to the '78 original, but is indeed a pitiful remake. No originality whatsoever in this pathetic, stupid, waste of what...$250,000,000??? I didn't see $250,000,000 on the screen at all, more like $250,000. Playstation game effects, not convincing at all. So, if your under 13, or of that mentality, you'll love this trash.

Seeking Krypton because some astronomers thought they found it??  This is LAME.  First of all, because the fortress contained all the knowledge the Kryptonians had supposedly and i'm thinking a map of Krypton's location would be in there.  Second of all, because Superman has telescopic vision.  Where'd the ship come from?

0743289412|3.0|Not my favorite SK nor my least favorite. I confess I have caught myself saying \\"smuck\\" a few times. <br /> <br />The sisters are the most intriguing part of the book and I would love to read more about them. How about \\"Amanda's Story\\" and \\"Darla's Story\\"....
076790592X|5.0|I'm not a sappy guy by any means and I also don't read a lot of fiction but this book blew me away.  Tuesdays With Morrie is the tale of a student chronicling his teachers slow death to the disease known as ALS.  The story is written through the eyes of the student.  The lesson of the story is to enjoy the little things in life while you still can and the book really brings that point home throughout its story.  I wouldnt go as far as saying this book changed my life but I would go as far as saying it gave me a new prospective on living it.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and recommend that anyone read it regardless of your interests or background.
B0000AUHPK|5.0|I remember seeing this film years ago on , I think , Masterpiece Theatre and wondering at Ralph Fienne's hypnotic, erotic, passionate portrayal of the tortured, manipulative, vindictive Heathcliff. Last night, I found myself watching bits of it on \\"YouTube\\" and fell in love all over again. Impulsive girl that I am, I immediately came here to amazon and bought the dvd. To me, there is no finer character in literature than Heathcliff and there is no more powerful study of the devastating effects of romantic love than Wuthering Heights. This film does justice to both.
B000065EMR|5.0|This is my second favorite Red Hot Chili Peppers album--Californication is a slight favorite.  I just received the Japanese version with the bonus track \\"Time\\", which is an amazing song--well worth the extra money.  If you like this album, then I don't think you will regret paying a little more.
B00005JL78|5.0|This film is simply Speilberg's finest hour. He will never top this, and yes I know I'm talking about the man who directed Jaws, ET, Close Encounters, Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List etc. This film has everything - breathtaking and groundbreaking special effects, a fabulous cast with superb performances (Cruise's finest since 'Born on the 4th of July' which was a tour de force) and an intricate byzantine plot that keeps you guessing until the very end. And I defy anyone to understand the incredibly complex and fast moving story the first time. But that's perfect as everytime I viewed it, it was as visually thrilling and exciting as the first time. An absolute classic, thoroughly compelling, gripping, engaging and stunning from start to finish.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|Like the Remastered Original \\"Star Trek\\" Series that is being<br /><br />aired now, Superman II-The DONNER Cut will bring a great<br /><br />vision up to date for the 21st Century!  Own this and the<br /><br />first Superman film on HD-DVD!  :D
B000BM6AVA|4.0|I was struck down by the sheer genious of 'Mesmerize' the songs were vibrant, topical and very dynamic. Rock songs with strange folk tunes in the middle was something I had never heard. <br />When I put on 'Hypnotize' the first song was a let down. Just a luggish metal song with a grunt. Nothing special.  <br />It did get better however. Was the experience as great as the first part of this double. No. But System Of A Down is still a unique band and one of the few bands that can still surprise me after listening to 1000s of records.
B000H5U832|5.0|'Cars' relies on such a beautiful personification, we forget the characters are really cars.  The whole human world has been transfigured, as \\"Braking News\\" comes on television, and cars watch their fellow heroes in Nascar-type races in the stands.  Playfully, we enter into the world of \\"Lightning McQueen\\" (Owen Wilson) who is trying to win his first \\"Piston Cup\\".  He is full of himself and not just engine oil, so he lazily creates a three-way tie with two other prima dona cars.  The tie-breaker takes place in California, but his smugness gets him off guard, and he is stuck with a sleepy desert town, Radiator Springs, off Route 66.  Here he meets some interesting fellow cars, including Hudson \\"Doc\\" Hornet (Paul Newman), a former racer and the town's judge, a rundown tow truck, Mater (Larry, the Cable Guy), and Sally, a Porche from L.A., enjoying the slower life as a lawyer in the country.  There's a love interest, but her distaste for his ego provides a series of events to have his egomania retreaded.      'Cars' has a lot of heart inside its chasis.  We forget we are dealing with cars that our laughter and tears come to the fore without us thinking about it.  It's the human comedy with a theme to reflect on slowing down and enjoying the road(s) in life.  Surprisingly effective, the story is beautifully executed with nuances like vocal appearances by Bob Costas and Richard Petty, which authenticate the movie even more.    'Cars' is the best of a great lot of animated features this year.  While 'Curious George' and 'Monster House' help reinvent animation, 'Cars' gets to the finish line better with a great story and a funny, touching delivery.
1400032717|5.0|Definitely one of the best books I have read. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon is a complex mixture of simple things. The simplicity of the language, style, ideas, characters and concepts is unique to this book. The expression of complicated life matters and situations in such a simple manner makes this book a definite must-have. <br />In the book, Mark Haddon borrows the voice of his lead character Christopher, an autistic child, to tell the story. Christopher is an autistic and smart 15 year old boy. He's a math whiz with an unsatisfiable appetite to solve problems. His approach to all life issues is to convert them into a math problem of some sort and find out ways to deal with these issues. <br />The story mainly revolves around Christopher's investigation to find out who killed his neighbour's dog Wellington. Despite his father's instructions to not pursue the issue, Christopher goes on to attempt to solve the mystery of who killed Wellington. <br />The story unravels before Christopher and he is hit with a reality far more complex than his own understanding of life. His investigations result in only unearthing long buried secrets of his mother who, he knows, died three years earlier. <br />Christopher's determination to solve the mystery of who killed Wellington and the mystery of his mother's death is something to be revered throughout the development of the story. The child's emotional roller coaster ride is witnessed first hand on every page. The reader experiences Christopher's feelings and emotions so transparently that it makes it extremely difficult not to feel attached to the story. <br />The story in itself is funny at times, sad and miserable at others; complex in one place and extremely simple in another. <br />This is a novel that you can be certain will change the way you perceive the things in your life once you are through. Your world will never be the same again. In a good way.
B0000549B0|5.0|I am sure you have already read the plot for this story so I will not go into that I just wanted to tell you what this movie means to me.<br /><br />I enjoy watching this movie at anytime!!<br /><br />Laugh if you will, but the times that I watch it the most is when I \\"have had it up to here\\" (with people, things, etc.) I guess it just kinda renews my faith in mankind.  I do wish that Elwood P. Dowd was living in my town. I would be his best friend, right after Harvey!!!  We three could have alot of fun together!!<br /><br />My favorite quote from this movie is when Elwood says, \\"My mother always told me in this world Elwood, she always called me Elwood, in this world Elwood, you must be oh so smart or oh so pleasant.  For years I was smart, I recommend pleasant. You may quote me.\\"  Not a bad philosophy to live by.  I have proven it to be the best way to live in this world.
B00004YZFR|4.0|This was a analysis of probably the most trying week for the Stones as a band. It showed footage of thier concert at Madison Square Garden on Thanksgiving weekend of 1969, and they were the greatest Rock and Roll band for that night as documented in their \\"Get Yer Ya Ya's Out\\", and that's something they really needed as the last few months had been stressful indeed as they finished work on \\"Let It Bleed\\" the firing of Brian Jones, and then Jones untimely, and somewhat suspicious death. The work they would start to do on \\"Sticky Fingers\\", and the marathon running around to 4 recording studios, and here they would take a break, and do some touring including a free concert for fans to just say \\"Thank You\\". This concert was billed as \\"The Woodstock Of The West Coast\\" as they were originally going to do this in Golden Gate Park, but the city didn't want the group there unless there was an agreement they would compensate for any destruction. I detect a little prejudice here as I've heard that the Grateful Dead had numerous free concerts in the park, and as far as I know no one complained about them. Anyway I know that the Dead and the Stones while doing both the same style music were in 2 different styles where the Dead seemed more intellectual and the lyrics were more seeking knowledge, and creativity the Stones were more aggressive in nature. Well finally the free concert was settled at the Altamont Speedway in Altamont, CA. It was pretty much thrown together in a hasty way as they were trying to get it accomplished before the holidays I suppose, but they had other acts there too. I knew about Jefferson Airplane, but didn't know about Ike and Tina Turner, or the other group there. I guess the decision to make the Hell's Angels in charge of security will remain an unsolved mystery. I know that it caused a big stink as there would be pointing of fingers afterwards, and one side accusing the other. The way it has the Stones pouring over the concert footage trying to make sense of this all. I know that the trouble really began when the Airplane had their singer Marty Balin assulted by the Angels. and there would almost be a confrontation between Paul Kanter, and the Angels. The Stones seemed to be the last group to perform, and the songs they would do in this concert were actually pretty good sounding. Of course the first song would be \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\" I always liked the way it sounded live compared to how it was done in studio, but of course there would be interruptions where constant fights would break out between the Angels, and concert goers, but there would be the ultimate downer where the Angels supposedly stabbed a concert goer named Meridith Hunter who was a 18 year old Afro-American male, and there was no real motive for this, or the movie didn't really give much detail to it; I saw that there was the fact he was trying to get with a couple of girls there, but was that the real reason, and of course there's the issue that Hunter had a gun there, so the question was: \\"Could this been political?\\" the movie does show someone collecting for the Black Panthers, but is it for the breaking up the group, or supporting their cause, but could Hunter's death been political persecution? The book of Rock lists claim that Hunter's death happened during the playing of \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\", but it only lists that there was a need for an ambulance over by the end of the stage, but no other notifications whether of death, or just injury, and it wasn't until \\"Under My Thumb\\" that the it was determined that it was murder. As I would mention earlier there was alot of finger pointing after the group left the stage, and the media gave the rundown of all that happened. I feel that whoever decided to appoint the Angels as security made a bad choice, and unfortunately, both the Stones, and the Angels will have to live with this for the rest of their lives. The fans well the movie depicted them in an appropriate light as them moving onto the next big party where they could do more drinking, drugging, sex, and fighting. It's like a person who has a big party at their parent's house, and there's alot of activity going on, and alot of bad stuff going on, and then there's nothing left, but a big mess, and alot of regret. I actually wanted to watch this 25 years ago when I was 14, but of course my parents wouldn't let me, but I had to watch this to get one thing answered for myself. That is the fact that while the Stones performed \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\" at Madison Square Garden a kid told me once that during that scene of the movie there was a large white balloon where something milky looking came out, and was the shape of a male organ. I have to remember to keep this clean, so you can look at this. I feel that it was a rather good job done on this documentary, and I feel that the morale of this story is \\"Don't Have A Party Unless You Decide To Take Full Responsibility.\\" I also looked through all the outtakes, and the movie itself there was no white balloon shape of male organ.
B000I5X81A|4.0|If you haven't already checked it out, you need to watch the DVD from Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar festival, to see the catalyst for this new CD, the stage performance with Eric and J.J. jamming on two Cale classics.  It was reported that the chemistry from that session was what made these two go into the studio.  I was impressed watching Cale play his guitar in a most unorthodox way, and yet get such a nice clean tone with great speed.  His trading of licks and solos with Clapton was fun to watch, so it was good that they decided to do some more work together.<br /><br />This collaboration must have taken quite some time to get finished.  The list of players is impressive, with backing bands that span many years for Clapton, from old friends like Nathan East and Billy Preston (RIP), to his most recent stage players from his 2006 world tour, such as drummer Steve Jordan, and slide master Derek Trucks.  I can see where this album might have been made a couple of songs at a time when time would allow over a period where all of these players were contemporary for that period.  If there is one weak point for me, it is that the players are listed on a single page by instrument, but with no annotation as to which player was used on which song.<br /><br />As to the album, it is immediately familiar on first listening.  The shuffle patterns and single note fills are classic Cale and mid-1970s Clapton.  There is nothing earth shatteringly original, but simply two guys playing music that they are very good at.  You don't feel that the almost one hour length is too long, which says a lot for so many similar types of songs.  One song quickly became a favorite after 4 or 5 listenings, and that was the Clapton / John Mayer penned \\"Hard to thrill\\".  John Mayer was also at the Crossroads festival, so maybe this was part of the process for him to join the project.  The bulk of the songs were written by Cale, and I'm sorry to say that for me the most out of place tune on the album was the sole Clapton-only written tune, \\"Three little girls\\".  This song would have fit right into the \\"Back home\\" CD that Clapton did to express the new joy in his domestic life, but it is not in step with the rest of this album.<br /><br />This is a welcome addition to the Clapton line-up, and after his last CD, a reminder that he can still play bluesy folk rock.  Again, nothing new, but still better than most of what passes for music these days.Clapton-only written tune, \\"Three little girls\\".

B000058THK|2.0|Overall, you will be hard up to find a more thoroughly complete two hand piano survey of Schumann's piano opus. However, for the more \\"popular\\" pieces such as the op 17, or the kinderszenen, these are decent to mediocre versions are best. They arent bad, Jorg Demus is a skilled pianist, though has always in my view been more successful in a supporting role, as evidenced by his masterful accompaniment in Dichterliebe and assorted Schubert lieder. If you are familiar with Richter's masterful Schumann interpretations-or Horowitz for many of the works, or Lupu, Argerich, these pale in comparison. If you are out for quantity-I would recommend the Ashkenazy set-though it is incomplete. Again, many of the works by schumann that you can only find here will only be of interest to the absolute Schumannaholic, which I am, but it is kind of a two way street because if you are a schumann madman, then you will know how third tier these performances truly are.
B00000F14B|5.0|Although fabulous when viewed at any time of the year, 1962's \\"The Music Man\\" is best when watched on or around the 4th of July.  The film paints such a perfect and endearing picture of life in a small, turn-of-last century American town that it has all of us wishing for a simpler time. <br /> <br />The story of a big city con man descending upon a rural Iowa town is strong enough to stand on its own even without the music.  When there is toe-tapping music, an iconic lead character backed by a solid supporting cast, amazing energy, all underscored by genuine Americana, it's a one-of-a-kind cinematic experience. <br /> <br />Although the movie is not the best technical production and there are numerous continuity problems and anachronisms, the strength of the story and the catchiness and exuberance of the music overwhelm any technical inadequacies of the film.

0767817478|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much. Not only did it deliver in the entertainment department, it had heart. By this, I mean that this Godzilla, like the original \\"Gojira\\" was a sympathetic character - a victem of humankind's thoughtless actions (nuclear experiments).<br /><br />  The original Gojira monster was based on what they thought dinosaurs looked like in the '50s, that is to say, \\"Godzilla-like\\". Now, paleontologists imagine dinosaurs as lithe, fast, agile, smart, and advanced. So the new Godzilla has those traits as well. I found it a nice comparison of dinosaur-to-movie phenomena. Sure, there are weak points to this movie, and some very strong ones. Some of my favorite things about the movie are: empathy towards animals despite what they do to us, a nice jab at film critics in the two Siskel/Ebertine characters, is the military force that adept at anything besides killing other humans, and finaly, what is the affect of human arrogance/ignorance (nuclear energy?), on the planet?<br /><br />  Just my thoughts.
B000I5X81K|5.0|He just keeps getting better & better.  This is an awesome new CD and a must-have for any Josh Groban fan. His voice is incredibly pure and emotional.     <br /> <br />Now - I have two questions for Josh - 1.  When are you coming out with a Christmas CD? (your version of 'O Holy Night' makes me cry and 'Believe' from 'The Polar Express' gives me goosebumps); and 2.  When are you going on tour to promote this CD?  (I took my Mom to see you at Mohegan Sun as a Christmas gift and it was one of the best concerts I've ever been to).
0452287588|5.0|I guess that most of the readers that come to this book are somehow acquainted with Eckart and his previous work, The Power of Now. As it has beed said already, this new volume still travels over the same subject, sometimes going deeper, at others simply by giving a more specif example and still at others by gently instructing readers to \\"do\\" certain exercices. In all cases what it still ressonates (to me at least) is the subtle, but real, change (being more Awake) that his way of expressing deep truths (Consciousness) and facts about the human condition evoke after reading it. So if you are looking for a book that will inspire and \\"point\\" to a reality of \\"being\\" I strongly suggest you ready this one and  (in the case you have not ready his previous work) The Power of Now. I am sure you will not regret!!
B000I5X81K|5.0|I just bought Josh Groban's new CD Awake, and I have to say it's great.  I was so disappointed in his last CD that I was ambivalent about buying this one, but I'm glad I did.  The theme from Romeo and Juliet in Italian accompanied by the cello, is simply beautiful.  Josh's voice is in top shape!  Loved it.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Fantastic album.  Muse avoids the \\"every song sounds the same\\" trap and comes up with some pop, some hard rock, some funk... you name it.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|Any fan of this band will like this, it's that simple.  Sure the quality is not so good here and there(sound drop outs, screen going blank or static-like...but it's rare) but it's well worth it.  The best concert on this DVD in my opinion is Cobo Hall January 1976 at the end of the first disc during their 'Alive!' tour.  The band was simply on fire that night-literally(you will see Gene's hair catch on fire if you look closely as the lights go out), you will see Paul confronting a fan by saying \\"hey you.  you.  you.  This is a rock & roll party, not a rumble\\", and you will see Gene sing the wrong lyrics to \\"Let Me Go Rock & Roll\\" and then figuring it out and getting it right.  The back cover implies this entire DVD is in color.  Not true.  The entire 'Winterland' show is in B&W and 'Black Diamond' on the midnight special is in B&W.  But that's hardly a deterent to buying this.  I was a little confused as to why they only put 1 out of the 3 songs Kiss lip synced to on the Paul Lynde Halloween special.  The commentary by Gene & Paul will reveal little things most Kiss fan never knew(for example, Paul getting his rose tattoo the day before the 'Winterland' concert and that's why he's not wearing a jacket during the show he says).  What I noticed the most was Ace and Peter.  Since they are no longer in the band, every guitar solo and drum solo I watched and thought they were great and it made me miss them more.  So any 'old school' fans will DEFINITELY want to own this.  I mean how cool is it to see Peter singing \\"Hooligan\\" in concert? Pretty rare.  A very good DVD to get for any Kiss fan, old and new. Volumes 2 & 3 are due next year and I can't wait!

037571457X|4.0|Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood, written and illustrated by Marjane Satrapi, is a comic book style (\\"illustrated novel\\") autobiography of memories of life as a child in Iran just before and after the overthrow of the Shah (roughly 1978-82), and during the war with Iraq.  Her parents are well-educated, seemingly progressive, and, through the eyes of a child, heroic.<br /><br />Life changes.  She experiences the mandatory use of the veil, stricter schools, hiding activities from nosy neighbors, and the phrase \\"...on a trip\\" as a code for death in war or by execution.  Children play games of torturer and torturee.  Satrapi reveals her evolution as a child rebel, albeit a selfish one focusing on the narrow-mindedness of youth... rebellion is wearing a Michael Jackson button and tight jeans in public.  However, reality gets closer and closer... a favorite uncle is imprisoned and executed, a friend is killed in an Iraqi bomb attack, food is scare, and teachers are more draconian.<br /><br />This book took about an hour to read.  There is good congruence between the script and the drawings, but the style of presentation as an illustrated novel means there is no depth to the story.  Perhaps the following book, Persepolis 2, will provide more.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|The one, outstanding reason to get this collection, is the 5.1 audio... its damn good; even in the patchiest of video sequences, the audio has been mixed to an awesome high grade.<br /><br />Video-wise, the KISSOLOGY set reaches its peak in volume one with the Crystal clear Video, and awesome audio of the Summit show.<br /><br />For myself, the one, the SOLE reason for getting this pack is the Promo clips from ROCK AND ROLL OVER, here shown as \\"DON KIRSHNERS ROCK CONCERT\\"... this material was the very first I saw of KISS way back in the 70;s. I saw it on Countdown in Australia on a Sunday night and went and bought the album the next day... so that was the prime reason for me .<br /><br />However, everything else is a bonus, and what a bonus.<br /><br />The KISS ALIVE promo clips are Video and Audio highlights, and the video varies but is damn brilliant when it is good, and the audio is just superb.<br /><br />It is extremely clear that this has been done by some great producers working  with bad source tapes, but presenting what they saw as the best, and they really come through.<br /><br />About my only query is ... why does Thayer get a Thank you credit?<br /><br />Also, if you get the bonus edition, the extra disc is definitely worth it, sound is great, even if the Video is patchy.<br /><br />I am SEVERELY looking forward  to vols 2 and 3  in the hope that the Reunion concerts which Ace  said  were  recorded in DAT  format produce a great product. This  would  certainly top off a prime  series.<br /><br />Sadly, it does truly show that KISS as it was, still is the KISS as it should be, and not the Faux KISS we have now, and this Video set is how the Commercial material should have been ALL along.<br /><br />ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0002V7OI8|4.0|Deep Impact is a rarity. Unlike many Hollywood movie about disasters, this film is largely based on the humanity angle: what would you do if a large percentage of life, maybe even all life, will be wiped out in a short amount of time? Sure Armageddon had it but let's face it: it was melodramatic cheese trying to pass itself off as carrying real emotion. While there is some trouble spots, this film is different in that it's geared primarily towards the human side of a crisis and it works better. <br /> <br />A simple Astronomy club meeting has young Leo Biederman discovering something odd in the sky, and Dr. Wolf, an Observatory worker makes it official: they found a comet. Problem is, it's heading for Earth. One year later, a reporter named Jenny Lerner accidentally stumbles across the story and she becames the world's link to the crisis. And so we follow several storylines from Leo's love for another girl, Jenny's familial problems and the astronauts sent to destroy the comet. <br /> <br />For those of you looking for action heavy stuff, it mainly has 2 key scenes: the astronauts' mission to nuke the comet and when one of them smacks into the Atlantic Ocean creating a massive tidal wave. While these are admittedly cool scenes, they're not the main reason to see the film and since the focus is on human reaction to impending death, they might seem out of place but it helps makes the story become a bit more epic and larger scale. The one thing though is that they're slightly ineptly directed, especially the wave sequence, where the scenes don't really register since they go by a bit too quickly or there's too much going on in one shot. <br /> <br />As for the cast, they're quite good and manage to be interesting in their roles. Morgan Freeman, aside from Martin Sheen, is probably the best President on screen, managing to be charismatic and leader-like while also having a commanding presence. Tea Leoni doesn't really have the greatest range but there's something likable about her. And always wonderful Robert Duvall has his trademark enthusiasm where even while mad, it doesn't come across as overly vicious. <br /> <br />The special features are very disappointing. This so-called Collector's Edition only really has about 4 featurettes and a commentary. Would've been nice if more stuff was included but as it stands it's the movie that makes it worthy of a purchase.
0743289412|2.0|After 20 years of reading King, he's finally let me down.  I've loved almost all his books (my favorites being \\"Misery\\" and \\"Dolores Claiborne\\"), but this time I just am not buying it.  There have been numerous reveiws already complaining about that secret language between Lisey and her husband; readers be warned, all that has been said about it is true. King uses the word \\"smuck\\" so much that I swear he's planning to copyright it.  All the sayings and phrases are tiresome and instead of endearing me to these characters, it put more distance between us.<br /><br />The story itself is cumbersome.  King has several plot threads going at once but the problem is that none of them are all that interesting. There was something about Lisey and her sisters that felt artificial, and the story of Lisey and her late husband Scott wasn't all that.  I believe that part of my dislike was that for the umpteenth time one of King's major characters is a writer.  How many more times are we going to go through this? I read and I read and I read and by page 200 I realized I really don't like this book.  I give kudos to King for experimenting with the narrative structure, but the problem was with the story he was narrating, it came out flat and cold.<br /><br />King said he was retiring a few years ago but he's still been writing.  I sincerely hope this isn't his last novel because I'm sure he still has a lot of great stories in that head of his - too bad \\"Lisey's Story\\" isn't one of them.
B000HT386M|2.0|Don't watch Click if you're in the mood for a light-hearted comedy.  The middle of the film is miserable.  Of course, it has a Hollywood happy ending.  The comedy bits are OK but few and far between.  If Click had been marketed as a drama, this would be less of a problem.<br /><br />The story line has some great life lessons.  Without giving away too much, the morals of this movie are: 1.  put family first; 2. don't wish your life away, but enjoy every minute of it, even the mundane.  For driving home those lessons, Click has some value.  It is also great to see Adam Sandler do well in a dramatic role.  He has more range than you might imagine.<br /><br />But there's something very unsatisfying about watching Click that's not fixed by the sugar-coated ending or the few bits of Sandler-esque pranks and smartass jokes. In short, it's a mediocre film.
B00030590I|4.0|This is the movie. It has substance, romance, music, everything.  <br />Tells many stories in one. The dedication of Zhao to calligraphy. <br />Alternative personalities and relations in different colors. Touching story of love and war. I have seen it by now like 10 times and will see it again. Itzhak Perlmans violin, vibrates with my heart. A true story told in a very mythical way. So why I still do not give 5 stars to this movie like I would to Kurosawa movies like Seven Samurai? Cause it has a connotation to promote power warship and dictatorship. Other than that this is a monumental art work. I will see it ten more times and still will want to see again. I even memorized some chinese lines.

0307237699|5.0|Obama's words are extremely powerful. He does not order or call out to anything. Rather he opens our eyes to some simple realities of truth that we may have forgotten. Obama is the type of politician that we hope for. The book is a beautiful read and quite inspirational to our own best selves. <br />
B00005JKHN|4.0|I'm sure we're all familiar with the story of Sleeping Beauty - the timeless classic of a beautiful princess, separated from her birth parents for 16 years in an effort to prevent her from pricking her finger and drifting into an endless sleep.  Her only cure, were this to happen would be the kiss of True Love.<br /><br />Of course, this film is Disney at his best, no doubt about it, and is a joy to watch for all ages, both young and old.  It works at many levels.  The musical score, based on a famous ballet, is exquisite and charming, and the story line, is multi-leveled and quite enthralling, both to very young children and to sage adults.<br /><br />It is interesting to note that Walt Disney changed this 14th Century story from a pagan tale to a Christian one.  The original story is one of rape and revenge, but Walt Disney's classic is one of triumph of Good over Evil.  I particularly love how Prince Philip is essentially impotent without the aid of the three magical faeries, Flora, Fauna and Meriwether, who obviously symbolize the Three Graces.  Without their help, he (nor any of us, is the implication), cannot succeed in the ultimate triumph over the Evil One, manifested in Malefacent, and her spell of Death, (or endless sleep - a reference perhaps to indifference to the Godliness around us?).  Also of interest is the reference to the spinning wheel itself.  In the 14th century, the art of weaving was terribly important and thus a young maiden, including a royal one, would well be judged on the quality of her weaving and spinning ability.  Additionally, the original story had her poisoned by a flax seed on the spinning wheel, and there truly is a poison carried by flax seeds.  Another example of Disney's Christian theme is the very nature of the story itself, of a child, a girl in this story, who is taken from her rightful parents for a certain length of time, but will be reunited again with them someday, presumably after her \\"death\\" and reuniting with her true love, a Prince of all Princes.  As I say, Sleeping Beauty, is a story to be enjoyed on many levels.<br /><br />Brilliantly done and a joy to watch with your family again and again.true love, a Prince of all Princes.

0307237699|5.0|This book gets five stars from me because it is much more thoughtful and much less platitudinous than the standard run of the mill \\"getting to know me\\" books that every politician with any ambition puts out.<br /><br />The author understands all the key points including how broken government is, how uncivil Congress is, how out of touch we are with reality.  He understands that government does have important safety net roles to play, that education and investment in science & technology are the foundation for the future, and so on and so on.  This down-to-earth yet explicit and integrated perspective puts him head and shoulders above the even the best of the best from the past.<br /><br />Bottom line: this book confirms the author's status as a first-rank leader (I don't insult him with the lesser term of politician) of great promise.  The promise is implicit in this book, not explicit.<br /><br />Now I want to see a book that addresses the ten threats, twelve policies, and eight challengers, and how he proposes to create a common-sense trans-partisan government that ends the winner take all nature of both the Cabinet and the Congress, and integrates real world information with real world budgets to get us to where the Comtroller General of the USA, the Honorable David Walker, says we need to be: providing for the future.<br /><br />A for effort.  The first book finished elementary school.  This book finishes high school.  I wait with bated breath for the serious book with all the details.

B00000AFHM|4.0|Belle and Sebastian's third album is still the best. Combining the simple guitar, cello, and trumpet of their previous two releases with an expanded orchestra section, this record is good from start to finish. The only misstep was the decision to include Stuart David's A Space Boy Dream. This expiremental spoken word track ruins the cohesiveness of an otherwise perfect record. It's clear Stuart Murdoch hasn't abandoned the quiet ballads of his former records, but the rollicking title track is a sign of the more rock-oriented albums to come. If you want the best respresentation of Belle and Sebastian's early period, buy If You're Feeling Sinister. If you want the best representation of Belle and Sebastian's entire output, buy The Boy With The Arab Strap.

B000I5X81K|4.0|[..]<br />I have been eagerly awaiting Josh Groban's new album, Awake for some time now and must say, it was worth the wait.  It was not perfect, but certainly an excellent piece of music with few exceptions.  Because I have met Josh, I expect his music to be as natural as his own persona and in a few places, it was not.  Josh's voice, one of the most beautiful in my lifetime, is sometimes over-shadowed by the intensity and drama that seems to surround him on this album. He manages to rise above this, however....why should he need to when his own beautiful vibratos and mastery of music say it all.<br /><br />My favorite is the beautiful \\"So She Dances,\\" followed by \\"February Song.\\"<br /><br />All in all, a wonderful musical journey through a young man's life!<br /><br />[..]
B0007TKNL0|4.0|I have heard some better singing, but this is an enjoyable film and CD. Probably not going to be a favorite of the straight operatic singer, or the high brow composer, but it appeals to the masses. And music to the masses is very important. <br />

Does true originality disturb you and drive you to seek cover in the soft womb of corporate created fluff marketed as the real deal? Then you're in for a treat with this album!

B00005K3PZ|5.0|When listening to this performance of the 2nd Symphony, I inately sense that there could be no better interpretation. No exaggeration, yet powerfully emotive and moving. This recording makes me love this early Bruckner symphony on a par with the massive 8th and 9th. Guilini brings the perfect subtlety, emotion, and phrasing detail without the slightest affectation. It combines a slow tempo and softness, yet at the same time, has power, authority, and drama. The slow movement is so heartfelt it's difficult for me not to shed a tear, even while listening in the car on a busy freeway. The playing and ensemble is excellent, sound quality very good 70s engineering, with perhaps a slight lack of dynamic range in the crescendos (very minor drawback). This performance is a great alternative to more aggressive and quicker performances, such as Wand's, which is an equally exciting way to do this symphony. But this Guilini/VSO performance is very exciting Bruckner.

The entire Matrix Trilogy is absolutely terrific.<br />There are also several insightful books written about the Matrix that would enhance your understanding and appreciation of the movie.<br /><br />I do want to warn you, however, you might experience one or two side effects from watching the Matrix.<br />First, there is a high probability that you will have an intense desire to see the other Matrix movies.<br />Second, you will have an inexplicable urge to get yourself at least one pair of sunglasses that are sported in the Matrix. Seriously, be good to yourself, don't miss out on The Matrix. ~ Mrs. B.
B000002JOF|4.0|My favorite Rea album, with (in my opinon) one of his strongest collection of songs. Usually you will find some \\"fillers\\", but I love every track, with the possible exception of the last (Tell me there's a Heaven), which is a little sappy for my taste. I was introducted to this album many years ago in a bar in Houston, where they played (no surprise) \\"Texas\\"...this still rates as one of the best tracks on the album (along with the title track), but there are many joys to be had here....listen to \\"Warm & Tender Love\\" and \\"Daytona\\". All in all, not much to dislike here

1932907009|5.0|Do you want to read about writing screenplays, or do you want to learn to WRITE screenplays?     When it comes to finding resources that will help you write a screenplay, the choices are endless. Type the word \\"screenwriting\\" in Google or Amazon and you'll see what I mean. There are an abundance of highly qualified and generally helpful books to choose from. While I gained a measure of knowledge from each of them, none gave me what I ultimately needed: a solid foundation of structure - the backbone of EVERY solid screenplay.  Enter Save The Cat!    Structure is more than a chalk outline or generic template, it's a way to ensure that your screenplay works! This isn't just important if you want to write, pitch and SELL your screenplay in Hollywood, it's absolutely indispensable! Save The Cat! clarified the screenwriting process and showed me how to actually write a structurally-sound screenplay. What this did was free my mind of all of the cluttered questions I had regarding HOW I was going to take this awesome idea from my head and put it in the proper form in which it needs to be.    In Save The Cat! The Last Book On Screenwriting You'll Ever Need, Blake Snyder leads you through the process with clarity and a sense of humor. He helps you develop a killer logline which, when done properly, is like discovering buried treasure in your front yard.  He also helps you understand genre and helps you create the type of hero that serves your story well. When you're ready to write, he guides you with a beat sheet that...well...can't be...uh...beat! Seriously, it guides you through your whole story. It lets you know where holes are and confirms when you have nailed that beat.     To tie the whole thing together, Blake explains the reality that studios can - and will - take your story, change or add characters, move scenes around, even change the dialogue; but if your structure is tight, it's still YOUR story. After all of your hard work, isn't that what you want?    Let me quickly address the couple of nay-sayers that have described Save The Cat! as \\"formulaic\\" or as a \\"short-cut\\" to writing a movie. Blake doesn't provide a short cut or a formula; he provides a firm structure on which to build a story - YOUR story. The idea is up to you; the dialogue is up to you; the characters are up to you. So, if you have that great idea, go out and buy this book, read it, use it to build your story and develop a great screenplay. Let me say from experience that if you have an idea, it's not a fill-in-the-blanks process. Save The Cat! will get you to think about your idea - and that first logline attempt kicked my butt! When I finally felt good about my first logline though, it was a true feeling of accomplishment and well worth the effort!    The best part of all this is that there's an awesome companion to the book. Now there's a Save The Cat! Story Structure Software that I just got and it is a huge help. I think it will be available on Amazon pretty soon, so look for it! On top of all of this, He's a great guy and he's actually SOLD screenplays. Wait, a screenwriting author who has sold screenplays? Go figure!
B0000009TK|5.0|The ill-fated 1988 band broke up mid-tour, and it ended up being Zappa's last tour.  This was one of Zappa's big bands, and this is the most interesting of the 3 albums documenting it.  This one focuses on extended instrumental sections.  The band is very tight and the big horn section allows for ineresting new horn-driven arrangements of oldies like \\"Black Napkins\\" and \\"Orange County Lumber Truck\\", plus I THINK it's the only album where \\"Dupree's Paradise\\" is really fleshed out in a \\"rock\\" format.<br /><br />One of the great things about Zappa's work is that he constantly reinvented his music.  Listen to different versions of songs like \\"Cruisin' for Burgers\\" over a 20 year period (this version is a  highlight of the album!), and you will see what I mean.  I am lucky to have seen Zappa live many times from 1978 to 1988, and a Zappa show was never predictable.  One could go see Zappa 2 or 3 nights in a row and get a different song list and truly improvised on-stage antics, audience participation, etc.  Zappa didn't just go through the motions.<br /><br />People who like \\"Roxy and Elsewhere\\", \\"Uncle Meat\\", \\"Burnt Weeny Sandwich\\" and \\"Grand Wazoo\\" will enjoy this one.<br /><br />I hope someday they will release the Swaggart-version Beatles meddley they played as an encore on that tour. I nearly fell out of my chair laughing during that one (use your imagination - it's Zappa!)!
B00008EYBW|2.0|it seems like the actors didn't even read the book before they decided how to play their parts!  amanda root is terrible as anne elliot... overly timid and shy... captain wentworth isn't at all handsome or dashing... and when they finally get together at the end, it's so awkward, bland, and unclimactic you wished you'd never watched the movie because it so tainted the way you saw that moment as you read it in the book... some people might have liked it, but i definitely didn't.  to get an idea of the adaptions of jane austen i did like, i liked the keira knightley and the colin firth versions of pride and prejudice.  this movie could have been better
B00005JPBJ|2.0|Ok, first of all, I'm not trying to get everyone all upset by giving this a low rating. I really wanted to like this film. I like/own Saw 1 and 2. I won't be owning 3. <br /> <br />Before Saw 3 even came out... they were already saying 4 was greenlit. Please... there's no need for a part 4. It's just going to end up feeling more forced than 3 did! <br /> <br />Yeah, that's my main gripe - Saw 3 felt SO forced. I'm a fan of \\"twist ending\\" movies. The twist in this one is LAME! Extremely forced. And when the twist comes, the almighty flashbacks serve more as a plea to buy the story than an unveiling of an ingenious plot. It's like the flashbacks beg, \\"See? This is why the twist is good. This is why story all goes together. See? You see? Please see...\\" <br /> <br />I DID enjoy the added developments they included to wrap up any questions from parts 1 & 2. That was cool that they took part 1, especially, deeper. <br /> <br />So... 1 star just cause it was \\"watchable\\" and another star for tying up the loose ends of the previous two films = 2 stars.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|My Chemical Romance frontman Gerard Way could be described as hypersensitive. When he's happy, his jubilant shouts and nasal la-la-la's bubble over with joyful glee, but when he's sad, his tormented cries evoke a pit of despair so bleak that he sounds like he must be drowning in anguish. It is that heightened sense of conviction and sincerity that resonates throughout The Black Parade, giving the anthemic choruses more bombast, the understated ballads more feeling, and the deranged freak-outs more ferocity. The end result is a collection of songs that are far more accessible than one would expect from such an extravagant and over-the-top spectacle, drawing influence from punk, metal, Broadway, and everywhere in between.<br /><br />The album starts with \\"The End,\\" featuring an acoustic storyteller vibe punctuated by Brian Wilson-esque oohs, pitted against adjacent slabs of majestic-but-vicious arena rock. Together the halves create an overture that channels a more twisted version of Queen, instantly memorable in just under two minutes. The other 12 songs are equally conflicted and effective, quickly bouncing from the explosive goth dance/rock of \\"The Sharpest Lives\\" to the energetic blues/punk shuffle of \\"House Of Wolves,\\" while still finding time to squeeze in Beatles-infected powerpop, in \\"Cancer.\\"<br /><br />The most adventurous song would have to be \\"Mama,\\" which sets the stage with an uneasily brooding polka, but after the straight up rock feel of the sing-along chorus lulls you into a false sense of security, all hell breaks loose. Way conjures Mike Patton's tortured screams over an apocalyptic metal breakdown, only to give way to a demonic waltz, featuring a guest spot from Liza Minnelli as Mother War. By the time the song's coda reaches its ending cadence with machine gun palm-muted guitars, the remaining fiddle and accordion figure feels very much like the aftermath of a bloody war.<br /><br />Lyrically, the album focuses mainly on the theme of death, which is examined in several different ways. In \\"Dead!\\" Way gleefully muses about how great it would be to die, even affecting a fake British accent in the character of a doctor who has discovered a heart defect and estimates that his patient has two weeks to live, all over a rollicking, bouncy beat behind a brass band. Meanwhile \\"Welcome To The Black Parade\\" and \\"Famous Last Words\\" deal more with the inevitability of death and the struggle to persevere through loss, perhaps suggesting that Way and company take ironic and insensitive jabs at death, not for shock effect, but because it actually scares them.<br /><br />Though the band largely plays to their strengths, there are occasional low points. \\"I Don't Love You\\" is too straight-forward a power ballad for its own good, and the undeniable energy of \\"Teenagers\\" doesn't make up for its inherent lack of depth, nor can the catchy chorus compensate for the ill-advised inclusion of a cowbell. But the flaws are few, and the infectious quirkiness hinted at from the beginning of \\"The End\\" remains a constant throughout the album. A huge step forward from their previous disc, The Black Parade is the sound of a band finally afforded the liberty of being able to experiment, and the result is hopefully a sign of things to come.which is examined in several different ways.

B000FS9FCQ|5.0|The Wachowski brothers' virtual opera prima (The Matrix Trilogy) is one of the few movies that I have absolutely and completely watched in awe. I was totally taken by surprise by it, as I never expected such a genre to  be so thought-provoking and deep to the point of pure and plain philosophical despair. Back then I even dared to define the \\"Trilogy\\" as \\"subversive\\" due to the unparalleled analogies between the fictional virtual world of Zion and its unbelievable reminiscences of so many realities in so many levels...   However shocked by The Matrix Trilogy, I still believed it to be just a lucky strike in the elusive and unknown world of a pair of siblings who call themselves the Wachowski Brothers.    My perception about the Wachowski's, however, drastically changed (and how) after watching the anarchic \\"V for Vendetta\\" (screenplay written by the Wachowski). As for the word \\"subversive\\"... well it falls short to describe the kind of message taken out by all of these movies as a whole. And don't get me wrong here. I do not condemn the subject and neither its treatment or implications. On the contrary, I am thankful for it as it had made so many out there realize how  any form of fundamentalism (whether you call it communism, fascism, nazism, populism and also, anarchism) are so close to one another. Just like extremes of a serpent that bites its own tail. Fundamentalisms of all kind and the painful similarities between them (in scope, in methods, in objectives) should leave us all with a lesson. And I just hope that kids out there that watch these movies just for the fun of the amazing aesthetics and the overwhelming digital effects somehow get to see beyond the surface and dare to explore the undergrounds.   As I come back to a particular phrase in \\"V\\" (\\"Peoples should not be afraid of their Governments: Governments should be afraid of their Peoples\\") I wonder how we got to the point in which (again) 5th. of Novembers are seemingly perceived as the ultimate solutions.
B000I5X81A|3.0|The Road To Escondido is a long overdue collaboration between J.J. Cale & Eric Clapton.  Mr. Cale was the writer behind two of Mr. Clapton's most beloved songs (\\"After Midnight\\" & \\"Cocaine\\") and his musical stylings were the influence behind his early 70's work with Delaney & Bonnie and his solo efforts.  The album started out with Mr. Cale as the producer, but shifted towards a full-fledged duet.  Most of the tracks are written by Mr. Cale and they are superb throughout.  The problem with the album is the production.  Mr. Clapton brought in long time cohort Simon Climie to produce and he adds too much slickness to what should be a roots record.  While it's not quite the adult contemporary sounds of Mr. Clapton's recent work, it's a little commercial.  That aside, Mr. Cale & Mr. Clapton are perfectly in tune with one another and you can sense a genuine joy the two share.  Also, the album contains some of the last work of the late Billy Preston.  The album is definitely worth a listen and leads one to hope that they two will again join forces.
B000069AUI|5.0|\\"A rush of blood to the head\\" is one of my favorite CD's ever. Spectacular music, great lyrics and Chris Martin's soothing unparalleled voice: a combination that will never cease to amaze me. \\"In my place\\" is such a moving song, and the beautiful \\"Green Eyes\\" is probably one of the most heatfelt love songs ever written. Though studio versions are great, I prefer Coldplay's plain acoustic versions 'cause they really showcase all of their assets as a band and simply put, the truly great music these guys make. Genious.
B000A3DFZE|1.0|If you are looking for boring, lifeless adult contemporary music, then this CD is for you.  If you are looking for a great guitar CD, this isn't it.  I had such high hopes for this CD after the Robert Johnson CDs and the Cream reunion, but all winning streaks must come to an end, and Clapton's comes to a screeching halt with this.  Of all the Eric Clapton CDs that I like, this isn't one of them.  I'm glad Clapton is now in a happy place (and deservedly so), but this CD just doesn't do it for me.

And he's just set it higher with this one. He has one of the most beautiful voices in music today and his material is top notch. He's brilliant.
B000000OAH|4.0|Greatly overshadowed by the mega albums A Night At The Opera, A Day At The Races, and News Of The World, Jazz holds its own, and then some. There are no major hits here, but the album is solid throughout. If you're not a \\"Bicycle Race\\" fan, take comfort: it's one of the weakest tracks on the album. My favorites are \\"Fun It,\\" \\"Leaving Home Ain't Easy,\\" and \\"Dead On Time.\\" Lots of good songs here. Strongly recommended.
0743455967|5.0|I'm not a Stephen King fan, because I can't read his books (too scary!). This, however, is not a horror tale, but bits of memoirs wrapped around writing lessons. A good book for any writer to have.
B000IAZOYO|5.0|A woman I know, along with an Amazon.com reviewer or two, couldn't comprehend how Francesca's boredom could lead her to betray her husband.  Francesca was not bored, perhaps unsustained by her husband's lack of passion, but not bored. Bridges of Madison County hit the bestsellers list for years because just about everyone has parted ways with someone they loved, whether it lasted four days or ten years.  True passion lives forever in the memory and can sustain for a lifetime.  This story is beautiful, one of my favorites.
0743298020|4.0|Diane Setterfield's best selling novel, \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\", is unashamedly derivative of almost every gothic novel ever written except in one key element; there is no mysterious, brooding, handsome master of the manor. And oh, how refreshing it was to skip that nonsense...almost. I was a tad disappointed at the whiff of romance in the end - but the rest of the story was so engrossing I forgave it. Probably Ms. Setterfield's publishers made her add it since it's patently impossible for literature or movies to depict a single woman as happily alone!
0790733226|5.0|First off, an overall great movie that I've watched several times. Great direction by Zemeckis, and Jodie Foster is brilliant as usual, and Sagan's ideas are well worth bringing to the screen. <br /> <br />Now for the nitpicking... <br /> <br />--SPOILER WARNING-- <br /> <br />I haven't read Sagan's book, but I'm guessing the story was altered to give it a wonderful sappy ending in which religion and science are \\"both right\\". Maybe they are both right, but this movie sure didn't show it. Because the ending has a monstrous gaping hole.  <br /> <br />In their effort to teach Ellie (and us) a lesson about faith, the writers contrive an ending where Ellie is left with nothing but a memory to verify her wonderful experience. An angry congressional inquiry, led by the James Woods character, investigates, and comes up with an alternative explanation for everything that has happened -- that it's all been an elaborate hoax perpetrated by the eccentric genius Haddon. But this is ridiculous, for many reasons. For one thing, how did Haddon come up with radically new technology capable of generating lightning and tidal waves yet inside of which \\"the weather's fine\\"? He's smart, but not that smart (he has self-sealing door metal technology that he never thought to sell?). <br /> <br />But more importantly, a signal from deep space could not be faked by a satellite, especially one that's been verified in Australia. And even if it could, THE SIGNAL WAS STILL THERE during the entire building of the machine. The aliens could not have known it was received at least until Ellie made her journey, so they would not have stopped transmitting. There was all the time in the world to verify that the signal was in fact coming from Vega. So there was clearly a message sent by aliens, and the public anger over wasted money makes no sense. So, the entire ending of the movie seemed stupid and manipulative to me. The message of this movie should have been \\"science trumps human stupidity\\", but thatmessage wouldn't have been commercial. <br /> <br />Oh yeah, and don't anyone ever put Matthew McConaughey in a sci fi movie again. Please.

0345350499|5.0|I found a very old-looking, musty hardcover on sale when I was 12. I took six months to read it, just reading in spurts here and there. What a huge impact it has had on me. It will forever color my view of the Arthurian legend. I loved how she focused on the women! It can be hard to find heroines in fantasy. I will always prefer her version of the legend. I love how she describes male/female energy as being one while still struggling with each other. I also loved the idea of the two sexes struggling for control in politics/religion on a multi-millenial scale.  <br /> <br />Someone complained that there was a lot of sex in the book, but that isnt what I took away from it as a girl.  <br /> <br />I recommend buying this for your daughter, especially dreamer-types.

B00000DR5I|5.0|My hat is off to anyone who can describe this music. I love this album, and since getting in on cassette a month ago (after having it on vinyl for about ten years) have been listening to it almost every night at bedtime...and almost every morning as I get up! I love this era of Tangerine Dream, from 1974's Phaedra up until about 1983. Though there are not too many melodies floating around, I find I can both fall asleep to it and listen to it. Actually, this isn't music that you really listen to...you put it on and just let all the synthesizers and keyboards and sequencers wash over you and absorb you. Even their album covers put me to sleep! Actually, the music is like the soundtrack to the cover...when I listen to the music, I think of the cover and the inside sleeve.<br /><br />I would say this album is a slight improvement over Phaedra...I don't know why. Maybe because I think it flows better or the fact that it only has two seventeen minute songs (or pieces, or movements) on it. My only complaint? It's not long enough!!! This is wonderful electronic, ambient music, and at the time being, one of my favorite Tangerine Dream albums.
B000001GQJ|5.0|Any one interested in knowing how piano should be played and can be played should get this CD. When I first heard the CD, I was surprised already by her debut recital Argerich has mastered such a distinctive style. I must disagree with the reviewer below who describe this as not imaginative, for nothing could be further from the truth. Argerich's playing is clearly her own, and no one else's. If one wants to hear a technically perfect but emotionally empty playing of Chopin, many of the newer artists would happily fill that bill. And for the record, Horowitz can make plenty of mistakes too, but that doesn't take the charm away from listening to his playing.  <br />That being said, this is one of the most turbulent, drenching rendition of Chopin there is. I love it.
0156711427|2.0|This was required reading for my British Literature class. It's the only novel in the class that I struggled with and only struggled from boredom. It is entirely possible that I just do not understand the genius that is Forster, but I did not enjoy this novel. A lover of Forster or Modernist writing might enjoy it more. It must be a classic for a reason.

B0000DC14V|4.0|'One-Eyed Jacks' might be considered the most self-consciously Western of the sixties, and possibly of all time... It contains undoubted visual attributes, gorgeous photographic sequences of an immense sandy desert, and panoramas of the spectacular California coast... Not often does one get to see the sea in a Western... Another of the film's great assets is its beautiful music...<br /><br />'One-Eyed Jacks' is slow, but very tough, realistic and softly romantic... The picture has excitement and violence...<br /><br />Brando summons all the reserve of anger, inner ambivalence, and emotional complexity in his nature... As a cowboy, he is tough, cunning, soft-spoken, sentimental, vicious, and occasionally masochistic... He plumbs dark reserves of desolation and revenge with an inner ferocity that had always been a part of him but had never before emerged full-force... As a director, he is meticulous, with a keen eye for spectacular outdoor cinematography, and an instinctive sense for the visual expression of inner conflicts...<br /><br />Karl Malden, whose surface friendliness and affability usually concealed either weakness or malice or both, is excellent as the ambitious, determined outlaw, and the volatile, treacherous, arrogant sheriff whose last poisonous spill: \\"You'll get a fair trial, and then I'm gonna hang you, personally.'<br /><br />'One-Eyed Jacks is largely a story of vengeance... The film begins with two American outlaws operating in Mexico... Rio (Brando), a happy-go-lucky man who considers himself a Don Juan, and Dad Longworth (Karl Malden), a crooked man looking for the opportunity to settle down...<br /><br />They raid banks with real ease and spend their leisure time drinking and courting women... Rio appears as a somewhat cultured bandit with a weakness for aristocratic young ladies... He gives one of them his most \\"precious\\" possession, his mother's ring...<br /><br />The Mexican police trail the pair and almost catch them at their lovemaking, but Rio and Dad fight their way out to the desert... The mounted police follow and the bandits are eventually trapped in the hills with one of their horses shot... Rio determines to stay... Dad promises to return with a fresh horse, but, tempted by two sacks of gold, he never come back...<br /><br />Rio is captured and spends five years of his life in a brutal Mexican prison, until he makes an escape, with the company of a friend called Modesto (Larry Duran).<br /><br />The embittered Rio is now a man bent on revenge... He learns in one Cantina that his ex-partner is the sheriff of a town called Monterey, and has taken himself a Mexican wife with a teen-age daughter... So he goes to visit him...<br /><br />A guilt-ridden Dad finds Rio pleasant and apparently willing to forget past differences... He presents his family, and invites Rio to stay for supper...<br /><br />Rio is in league with two bandits, Bob Amory (Ben Johnson) and Harvey Johnson (Sam Gilman), and they have come to Monterey to steal a bank... They grow impatient, but Rio assures them of his intention not only to rob the bank but to kill the sheriff as well...<br /><br />Obviously, Longworth is not completely convinced about his friend, and becomes uneasy when Rio and his step-daughter show a romantic interest in one another... He well remembers Rio's past amorous adventures and he has no wish for anything that will delay Rio in Monterey...<br /><br />The town engages in a fiesta, with the bank not planning to open for several days... While the respected sheriff joins the townspeople in their festivities, Rio seduces the tender Louisa...<br /><br />The next morning, in a saloon, Rio approaches a drunk mistreating one of the house girls and knocks the man down... The drunk reaches for a shotgun and tries to shoot Rio in the back... But Modesto (as Bronson in 'Jubal') helps save Rio from the blast... The resultant outbursts Longworth to put his grisly double-cross into effect...<br /><br />He takes Rio intothe street and arrests him with the help of his deputies... He ties him to a horse rail, flogs him with a whip, smashes his right hand with a rifle butt, puts him on his horse and drives him out of town...<br /><br />Rio retreats to a small fishing village on the coast with his partners and nurses himself back to health... Louisa visits him at his place to tell him she is in love... Rio's eyes are full of hate against her step father... He is entirely blind in his determination for revenge... Louisa wants him to forget, to leave his dark past for a brighter future... She leaves without mentioning she is expecting a baby...<br /><br />For over a period of six weeks Rio practices with his gun in an intent to regain the use of his hand... Amory and Johnson grow impatient, and decide to make their own move... From here the action is carefully builds towards an explosion...<br /><br />A carefully chosen supporting cast augmented the proceedings in fine style:<br /><br />- Katy Jurado repeats her role of the loving and understanding mother...<br /><br />- Ben Johnson plays the unscrupulous cowardly thief who avoids Brando's fury...<br /><br />- The gentle Pina Pellicer does her earnest best to temper the intensities of her man...<br /><br />- Slim Pickens plays the revolting deputy intimidated by an empty Derringer..<br /><br />Brando's 'One-Eyed Jacks' comes on as taught and tight, acted with deep feeling and intense concentration... Brando and Malden play largely a stylistic battle....  <br /> <br />He takes Rio into the street and arrests him with the help of his deputies... He ties him to a horse rail, flogs him with a whip, smashes his right hand with a rifle butt, puts him on his horse and drives him out of town... <br /> <br />Rio retreats to a small fishing village on the coast with his partners and nurses himself back to health...

B000F0UUIM|5.0|There are striking differences between 'Stagecoach' and 'The Searchers' reflecting a change more important than the mere passage of time:<br /><br />- 'Stagecoach' is a classic Western... 'The Searchers' is a rich Western...<br /><br />- 'Stagecoach' explores major social issues and themes... 'The Searchers' explores complex moral issues and myths concerning the frontier...<br /><br />- 'Stagecoach' captures frenetic action and awe-inspiring panoramas... 'The Searchers' captures the beauty and isolating danger of the frontier...<br /><br />- 'Stagecoach' is about characters of clashing social classes/values... 'The Searchers' is the complex story of a hate-ridden quest and odyssey of self-discovery...<br /><br />- 'Stagecoach' shows the classic attack on the stagecoach by the rampaging Apaches... 'The Searchers' shows the Comanche attack on a home without ever showing the attack itself...<br /><br />- 'Stagecoach' shows one of the most enjoyable rides in cinema history... 'The Searchers' shows the Old West as visually magnificent, but very dangerous to live in...<br /><br />- 'Stagecoach' captures the untamed, rocky wilderness in Black and White... 'The Searchers' captures the vast, sprawling desert wilderness in grand Technicolor fashion...<br /><br />- 'Stagecoach\\" is the first movie Ford filmed in Utah's Monument Valley... 'The Searchers' is the 9th time Ford shoots footage in Monument Valley...<br /><br />- 'Stagecoach' holds our attention because its story is in continual change... 'The Searchers' hunts us for its unique cinematic art...<br /><br />- 'Stagecoach' made John Wayne a star... 'The Searchers' stars the biggest Western star of all time the 'Duke.'<br /><br />- 'Stagecoach' is a picture that excites the sight... 'The Searchers' is a film that moves the heart...<br /><br />- In 'Stagecoach' Wayne shoots and kills Apaches... In 'The Searchers' he kills Comanches and even shoots two bullets at an Indian corpse...<br /><br />- In 'Stagecoach' John Wayne is a charming, reluctant outlaw... In 'The Searchers' he is an embittered man, a prejudiced Indian hater...<br /><br />- The essence of 'Stagecoach' is the humanity that resides in all of us... The essence of 'The Searchers' is one man's tragedy...<br /><br />'The Searchers' is a stunning film with enormous scope, and breathtaking beauty, the ultimate meeting of two legends who frequently worked together--John Ford and John Wayne...<br /><br />\\"The Searchers\\" brings the feeling to focus in the story of the abduction by Indians of two white girls and the long hunt for them that becomes a personal crusade...<br /><br />\\"The Searchers\\" is about just such a raid and the terrible obsession of a man who seeks not only to rescue captives but to exact fearful vengeance...<br /><br />John Wayne comes riding back from Confederate service in the Civil War, three years after it's over, to the Texan ranch he co-owns with his brother (Walter Coy). There's bitterness and mystery about the man... There are gold double eagles in his saddle-bags and there's a clammed up look in his eyes that says whatever he's done, or whatever he's been through, he's telling nothing... It's obvious, though, that he's glad to be home, that he's quite fond of his brother's wife (Dorothy Jordan), but he hates the fact that they've adopted a Cherokee half-breed (Jeffrey Hunter) into the family...<br /><br />When Ward Bond, a preacher-cum-Rangers' captain, drops in to form a posse, Wayne goes along with him, only to find later that they've been decoyed away by Comanches... He gets back to learn that his brother, his wife, and their son have been killed and their two daughters have been abducted...<br /><br />As always, certain words, sequences, images stay in the mind and evoke an emotional response:<br /><br />- The wind sweeping across the landscape and through a frontier woman's black hair...<br /><br />- The homecoming of a lean ex-Confederate soldier (against a bright sky) approaching a solitary house...<br /><br />- The sad reflective look of a loner, sitting on the porch with only a dog for company...<br /><br />- A married woman seen, by a Captain/Reverend, taking out and gently caressing her brother-in-law's cape in a manner that betrays her love for him...<br /><br />- The ride of the posse through the grandeur of Monument Valley, Utah...<br /><br />- White men riding scared through a valley while marauding Indians surround them between two parallel lines...<br /><br />- The anguish face of a man agonizingly realizing that his brother's family could be the target of a Comanche murder raid...<br /><br />- A shadow covering a ten year old girl, and the shocking view of an Indian standing menacingly before her...<br /><br />- The catchphrase, 'That'll be the day!'<br /><br />- A long view of a two searchers riding along a ridge in front of a sunset...<br /><br />- The passionate frenzy of an avenging man, shooting wildly at a herd of buffalo...<br /><br />- The 7th Cavalry riding beautiful horses in lines, galloping through an icy river, and carrying colorful flags against the white of the snow...<br /><br />- Dignified women line up on one side, and their well-behaved men on the other, to the tune of \\"Shall We Gather at the River.\\"<br /><br />- The old man Mose, peacefully sitting, on the porch, in the family's rocking chair...<br /><br />'The Searchers' is a big motion picture that cries 'wilderness' and the images sustain it... The eye is constantly filled with space, and isolation... It is perhaps the first film to clearly investigate the emotional bases for the racial tensions between Indians and whites, and shows a shocking massacre of a Comanche village...<br /><br />John Ford was certainly a fantasist that has meditated on the West for a long period of years and has created an imaginary West that is uniquely his own...

B000059HB7|4.0|For many, Hawks' 'Rio Bravo' is the perfect Western... For me it is the antithesis of 'High Noon,' and the clearest exposition of Hawks' philosophy of professionalism... His tough lawman solves his own problem without going out looking for help... So he welcomes volunteers and in fact depends on them... What is more, he wins by displaying superior skills and quicker wits...<br /><br />The survivors in Hawks' philosophy are the ones who conduct themselves with the greatest degree of coolness and discipline... It is not difficult to appreciate why Hawks has used substantially the 'Rio Bravo' plot, with only minor variations in both his subsequent Westerns, 'El Dorado' and 'Rio Lobo.'<br /><br />In Fred Zinneman's 'High Noon,' Gary Cooper struggles to round up a posse that might help him deal with four desperadoes arriving on a noon train to kill him... In \\"Rio Bravo,\\" John Wayne is faced with a similar situation but takes on the forces of evil in the shape of a gang of local tyrants...<br /><br />Wayne always makes us feel that somehow he'll cope... So when the wagon master Ward Bond asks him if he wants to use any of his men as deputies in fighting Burdette's men, he turns down the offer... Wayne, holding a brutish prisoner Joe Burdette (Claude Akins) on a murder charge, waits for the U.S. marshal to take charge of him... But the prisoner's powerful brother Nathan (John Russell) wants him free and is determined to release him by any method possible...<br /><br />The obvious method is the traditional one--hired gunmen--and, in effect, the sheriff becomes a prisoner himself, in his own town... But in this instance the lawman is not absolutely without help... The two deputies are a semi-crippled veteran (Walter Brennan) and a pretty hopeless drunk with a past 'fast' reputation (Dean Martin).<br /><br />But the whole point about this cleverly conceived movie is that this unlikely trio do in fact have something to offer when the cards are dealt... Like the sheriff, they're professional people, and what Hawks seems to be saying is that whatever the odds, such people will always have the courage, and the deeds... This is demonstrated in one inspired sequence which has become a classic: Dean Martin - drying out and eager to win back his self-respect - tells Chance that he wants to be the one who chase the killer into a saloon, and that Chance should assume the less dangerous role of backing him up from the back door...<br /><br />'Rio Bravo' is a beautifully controlled film... John Wayne, who re-created and heightened the mythology of the West, is at his best...<br /><br />John Ford imitates Howard Hawks' tendency for having his male characters never back down from a fight even when it means they are initiating the fight themselves... In Rio Bravo's famous wordless opening, villain Claude Akins throws a silver dollar into a spittoon, daring Dude, so desperate for a drink, to humiliate himself, and get the coin... Hawks' clever camera emphasizes how far beneath the standards Dude has fallen... Now Wayne is ready to confront Akins...<br /><br />The same scene in Ford's 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.' Lee Marvin trips unarmed James Stewart as he carries a steak dinner to Wayne in the restaurant where he works... He stumbles and the steak falls to the ground... Stewart has been obviously humiliated... Suddenly Wayne enters the frame, and orders Valance to peak up 'his' steak, revealing his gun belt as he faces him... He is ready for the showdown...<br /><br />In 'Rio Bravo,' Hawks' men win out primarily because they fight together... But Hawks helps them by having the outlaws mistakenly play a Mexican tune called 'cutthroat,' a song which Santa Anna tried to intimidate the Texans under siege in the Alamo... As the music plays, we see Dude putting down his glass untouched... He observes that his hands no longer shake...<br /><br />In Hawks' 'Rio Bravo' there is tenderness, and humor... In Hawks' film, a man is defined by how well he relates to women, how well he handles pressure and how he reacts to danger... Angie Dickinson playing the gambling gal, enriches the mixture with a nicely judged performance...<br /><br />'Rio Bravo' is an action Western, which captures a legendary West that fits the legendary talents of Wayne and Hawks... But what makes the film so special is the relationship between the individual characters... It is a traditional, straightforward Western, good-humored and exciting, rich in original touches...<br /><br />The best moment of the film when Martin and Nelson join each other for some singing and guitar picking, and Walter Brennan joins in with his harmonica and his scratchy voice... The film has a terrific score by one of the great film composers Dimitri Tiomkin...ned by how well he relates to women, how well he handles pressure and how he reacts to danger...

B000AARKOO|3.0|Kingdom of Heaven is not at all a bad movie.  Moreover, Kingdome of Heaven is a movie that is worth watching, I will not discount that.  However, I do not believe that I would recommend purchasing this movie.<br /><br />The Movie is poorly constructed.  I did not care about the characters; perhaps this was due to Orlando Bloom's poor performance. Additionally, Orlando bloom is a lowly blacksmith in a small town, then his father comes to find him to ask for forgiveness and Orlando decides to join him on a quest to the Middle East.  Orlando quickly becomes an amazing Leader and Fighter; and becomes a prominent figure in the Middle East; somehow.<br /><br />In short, the Story line feels cheap.  It feels like it was written buy a High School student.  The Characters have no soul to them.  And the story only advances to introduce a new fight.<br /><br />The actual style and film of the movie is good.  It is very well shot.  The scenes are beautiful and almost take you out of the movie just because they are so amazing.  I absolutely the love the way the movie looks.<br /><br />The Score is generally uninspired.  It simply sets the mood, but doesn't break and rules or do anything enjoyable during the movie.<br /><br />Overall, it's not a bad movie, its an okay movie.  Certainly better than many films.  However, this is not a film that deserves extreme praise, or any notation in history.  This is a film that I expect to have forgotten by next week.
0783225725|3.0|The exotic location in the desert, near Lake Mono in the California Sierras, certainly gives the film a fresh and refined look among Westerns...The sparkling colors of the backgrounds and the changing cloud formations gave effective shots...The film has certainly the most dramatic opening sequence of any Western...<br /><br />Through the burning desert, Bruce Surtees' lens discovers a lone horseman.... The camera pans with the horseman to reveal a small town by a lake-lagoon... The horseman rides in, the camera tracking behind him, interrupted with faces of suspicious locals - even a coffin maker with his merchandises - and instantly one is reminded of Sergio Leone and his faithful reproduction of Kurosawa... A coach driver cracks the whip... The horseman turns, and moves back... He enters a bar and asks for 'a beer and a bottle.' A town heavy intervenes: 'Flea-bitten range-bums don't usually stop in Lago. Life here is a little too quick for them. Maybe you think you're fast enough to keep up with us!' The drifter replies: 'I'm faster than you'll ever live to be!'<br /><br />True to his promise, the Stranger kills the 'trouble shooter' and his two friends, and also rapes the town belle who responds as any Eastwood feminine victim is obliged to, with resistance turning strangely to joy... The town midget, Mordecai (Billy Curtis) offers him a cigar inquiring: 'What did you say your name was again?' The hardened Stranger replies: 'I didn't!'<br /><br />The Man With No Name has returned, this time, quite literally, with a vengeance... His dictatorship is flavored with cool humor... The name Billy Borders is mentioned to him...'Don't know the man,' he confesses.'You didn't have much time to,' comes the reply, 'because you shot him yesterday.'<br /><br />When his rape victim, Callie Travers (Mariana Hill) inaccurately empties a pistol at him during his bath, he casually resurfaces, cigar still in his mouth, and in an aside to his sidekick, Mordecai, reflects: 'I wonder what took her so long to get mad?' His fellow chauvinist suggests, 'Maybe because you didn't come back for more.'<br /><br />The townsfolk accedes to the Stranger's requests, who pushes them to the limit, even forcing them to paint the entire town blood red... 'When we get down,' says one of them, 'this place is going to look like hell.'<br /><br />This is the Stranger's intention; he takes a brush and strokes out the name 'Logo' on the town sign and writes 'Hell' instead.<br /><br />In a series of flashbacks, primarily from the Stranger's point of view and later from Mordecai's, it is revealed that the townsfolk stood by and let three men whip their Marshal to death... The Marshal had discovered that the basis of the town's prosperity, a mine, was actually on government land and not on the townspeople's own. He was going to report this, so no-one felt obliged to intervene when he met his vicious end... His body now was lying outside the town in an unmarked grave: 'They say the dead don't rest without a marker of some kind... he's the reason this town's afraid of strangers.'<br /><br />Now they have reason to be afraid of the three men who paid the price for the crime in which they all agreed... The Stranger analyzes this fear: 'It's what people know about themselves inside that makes them afraid.' The town reaction to his is reserved... A group of vigilantes try to kill him... The Stranger repays them with a stick of dynamite... Despite their training, the remaining locals are horrified when they realize that he does not intend to remain for the final showdown...<br /><br />\\"High Plains Drifter\\" is one of the most important Westerns ever made, and when Eastwood takes his rightful place in film history alongside Cooper and Stewart and Wayne, this is the film that will be seen as the quintessential example of his art...wonder what took her so long to get mad?'

1572814349|5.0|I just recently bought the deck and my first response is wow.  The deck is extremely beautiful and brings the reader both into something very contemporary (what they are dealing with now) and deep into the past (when the deck was made).  I found the deck to be both easy to read, yet filled with symbolism.  I've already done a reading with them for a friend of mine and it was to the point.  One customer was put off by the fact that the author prefers to use them for her personal insight.  The author wasn't making an insult about those who do, but rather was showing her own personal use.  If I understand her, she uses them like Jung did, to tap into the archetypes of the ages.  Evem though that's her personal use of the cards, I find the cards have an universal appeal.  Despite what was her personal use of the cards, even though my reading was \\"of the fortune telling persuasion\\" I felt it was dead on.
0783228007|3.0|After \\"Dirty Harry,\\" Eastwood returns to the West to work for the first time and the last with John Sturges...<br /><br />With quality Westerns like \\"Bad Day at Black Rock,\\" \\"Gunfight at the O.K. Corral,\\" and \\"The Magnificent Seven\\", Sturges would be the right filmmaker to accelerate Eastwood's cowboy career... In the event he wasn't...<br /><br />The excellent sketching of characters and the poignancy of the dilemma of the peasants which made \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" such a classic Western were deplorably absent in \\"Joe Kidd\\" and the film never escaped from the weakness of its own screenplay...<br /><br />Eastwood brought some of the qualities of Leone Stranger, but lacked his style, his wit and his class...<br /><br />The film is set in the small town of Sinola, New Mexico, at the turn of the century... Mexican peasants find themselves being exploited and persecuted by American landholders, most notably land baron Frank Harlan (Robert Duvall). The peasants find a charismatic leader in Luis Chama (John Saxon), who takes them before a biased judge to defend their land rights...<br /><br />Upon learning the judge's nature, the Mexicans turn to violence and nearly kill the judge whose life is saved by Joe Kidd (Clint Eastwood), a prisoner jailed for drinking too much...<br /><br />This action endears Kidd to Harlan, who recruits him as a tracker for the posse he has hired to annihilate the poor Mexicans who oppose him...<br /><br />However, Kidd's commitment to Harlan's cause grows weaker the more he observes the landowner's methods... At one stage Harlan takes over a small Mexican town and threatens to kill all the inhabitants if Chama does not give himself up by a specified dead time... Kidd considers the action cowardly, and decides to change sides and join Chama's forces...<br /><br />If you are happy to see Eastwood back in the saddle, and you want to watch him with Robert Duvall, don't miss this highly forgettable Western... I'm quite sure it will manage to hold your attention...

B000EXDS5M|5.0|George Roy Hill's film has its excitements and it claims the fashionable climactic bloodbath, but mostly it's played for fun...<br /><br />It's a highly individual Western; a triumph of style, in fact... The style is dominant, intelligent, flowing with charm; the playful teasing, and Newman supplied with a hat on a bike, and the contemporary lyrical Bacharach pop tune... It's a style that flowers in the Newman-Redford relationship, which is one of the most affecting in movies...<br /><br />All this gives it the feel and look of fanciful myth carried to a point unusually removed from reality... Backgrounds are sketched rather than etched... You are never really moving toward the west in time and place... With belief suspended, feelings are only light1y involved...<br /><br />But it's derring-do at its most flamboyant and given a tangy taste by its essentially modern sense of humor... When Butch and Sundance ride back from relaxation to their Hole-in-the-Wall lair and find they have a mutiny on their hands--Harvey Logan (Ted Cassidy) wants to take over--Butch doesn't quell it with bullets but with a boot up Logan's backside... It's that kind of picture...<br /><br />Similarly, when too much dynamite scatters the haul from a rail hold-up, this is a moment for wry, amusing comment... And when the posse pursues the pair this is one posse that 'heroes' can't easily shake off... It's always there, cleverly made more irksome by long-shot, so that finally only a 'death defying leap' as the circuses say, can separate hunted from hunters....<br /><br />\\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" is undoubtedly a captivating tour de force... Its flavor is preserved from cloying by just the right edge of wistfulness provided by Katharine Ross as the schoolteacher girl-friend who goes along and who suggests the transience of it all...<br /><br />Newman and Redford good-natured fellowship is felt from the opening to the final scene... Sundance seems closer to the traditional Western character... He is strong, silent, willing to face confrontations and shoot it out... Butch is an atypical outlaw, enormously charming and courteous, has never killed anyone, and tries to avoid showdowns...<br /><br />Throughout the film, Newman is engagingly spontaneous in his expressions, gestures and timing of dialog...While Sundance is practical, Butch is a hopelessly ridiculous optimist and romantic dreamer... While they flee the posse, he continually expresses optimism, but beneath is a child-like need for reassurance... Small indications of his self-awareness emerge at other times, undercutting his casual exterior... For instance, despite the naturalness of the m&eacute;nage-&agrave;-trois, Butch is really the outsider, and he knows it... In the lovely still-photo montage of their New York holiday, Butch watches with wistful longing as they dance, but then smiles--aware of his isolation but content in their happiness...<br /><br />\\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" earned seven Academy Award nominations including Best Picture... It won four (Cinematography, Score, Song, and Original Screenplay).l Western character... He is strong, silent, willing to face confrontations and shoot it out...

B000HCO840|2.0|The two stars belong to Wolverine and the Pheonix. All of the sequences and plot elements that these two characters provided in this, the third installation of the X-Men series, were thought out and bolstered the true spirit of their X-Men influence. However, the rest of the film, was rushed and obviously a hand-off.  <br />For those of you that haven't watched, read no further: <br /> <br />Cyclops is killed off in basically the first 10 minutes of the film... <br /> <br />Storm mysteriously looses her accent-- Halle Berry was a horrible choice to begin with. Plus, she get's to be in charge, and finally takes charge?... after Xavier's unfortunate death-- the best element and scene in this film. Honestly, I was very moved.  <br /> <br />Rogue is completely useless... used less... in this film. Seems Miss Paquin only showed up for the paycheck... you weren't missing out on much kid. <br /> <br />Mystique... well, she was killed... no more eye candy. I didn't weep. <br /> <br />Vinnie Jones; love you man, but you are too intelligent for Juggernaut.  <br /> <br />And, what dissapointed me the most... how on earth could they take Magneto's power's away. The cure vacine plot was so ridiculously concoted to the point where we, the audience, were expected to believe that Magneto deserved to lose his genetic abilities... how democratic of you. <br /> <br />Basically, Singer moved on, and left a great comic-to-film series hanging in the breeze-- one of the few gems in the genre, because you all know that most of these flicks leave much to be desired... Fantastic 4, Daredevil, come on.  <br /> <br />Oh, thanks for the cameo Stan. Wonder how you felt about the Ratner treatment.   <br /> <br />If you're gonna see this flicker, keep your attention on the Wolverine/Pheonix plot. Everything else surrounding is just explosions and bad hair...  <br /> <br />Cheers
B00005J6UP|5.0|This movie is a classic and thank you for making it available to me and especially in a timely manner.
B000I0QLZU|5.0|There is such a pile of macho manure in this film that you need a snorkel. Arrogance runs so rampant across the screen that you can't tell the good guys from the bad in this movie. I remember when heroes had a little humility. That's what gave them staying power. Look at the likeable Indiana Jones that Harrison Ford created. Even look at the characters in the MUMMY. In that film even the villain had his moment of pathos and he even got to come back in the sequel! I'll tell you, that mummy was no dummy. Lara, you are out of your league. It was great to see Richard Johnson on the big screen once again on this film's theatrical release. That's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. Thanks Richard.
B00001OH82|2.0|I love Bowie, but the music in Tin Machine is just so... harsh. Tin Machine is an appropriate name for it, more so than, say, heavy metal. I can easily listen to Heavy Metal, rock, hard rock, etc. but this stuff almost hurts my ears. It is not an easy listen, I'm afraid to say.<br /><br />Still, for hard core Bowie fans, You'll probably want to hear it at some point.
0307346609|5.0|At first glance, one might discern that this book is about zombies.  The word \\"zombie\\" is on the cover, the imposing \\"Z\\" in World War Z stands for Zombies,  and the environment and background is filled with zombies.  However what this book is REALLY about is people, people put into a very extreme apocalyptic situation, and how this effects government policy, technology, sociology, psychology, religion, culture, racial barriers, and pretty much every quirk that seperates us from the living dead. <br /> <br />The book is written, not as a comprehensive story through one person's eyes, but rather a long series of interviews with \\"real survivors\\" of the catastrophe, written from cover to cover in full themed tone, even the critic's reviews on the back were written within character of the novel.  This gives not the idea that you're reading fiction, but a strong sense of non-fiction, as you read through the personal interviews it feels very much like these are real people that you could really meet. <br /> <br />Max Brooks understands the meaning of Romero's social critique through the medium of zombie horror, and takes it to it's fullest sense throughout this book, not only concerning with the American reactions, but also Israel, South Africa, Russia, Cuba, Japan, China, and more.  What is most noticable about the book is the striking realism in a very unrealistic situation, Max is extremely insightful as he analyzes just how a nation WOULD react to such a threat as this. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book not just to fans of zombie movies, but anyone who is fascinated by political process, national policy, sociology, psychology, etc.  Either way, I simply can't recommend it enough, and reading through it will leave you demanding for more.
B000EJ9MTW|2.0|Don't get me wrong, this is a good band, talented musicians. <br />I think they're trying too hard to sound \\"classic-rock\\". <br />Every song on this album sounds exactly the same. <br />You heard one, you heard them all. <br />I got rid of it the next day.
0064407667|4.0|Having heard much about the Lemony Snicket series, I had to pick up Book One and determine if this was a series I would like to start sending to my eight-year old niece who has begun her love of reading.<br /><br />The story was an interesting story for children since it included the death of the children's parents and their ultimate abuse by a relative, and it remained a positive book with other features integrated by the author.  These features include an excellent manner of introducing and explaining new vocabulary to the reader as well as demonstrating and special characteristics of the story's characters.<br /><br />I liked how the author would use a word and then explain it.  While that methodology began to get old, it has to be great aid for a young reader! The author uses the word, then gently educates the reader on the word's meaning in context.<br /><br />The characters also had non-stereotypical characteristics and the story made their personalities believeable.  The boy had more insights due to being well-read and the older girl had the mechanical mind.  These traits can inspire both genders of young readers to aspire to either area of interest as well.<br /><br />I will send these to my niece and am on my way to read book two through thirteen...
B000BM6AVA|1.0|Even though many will not agree, SOAD seems to be caught somewhere in a pop-music downward spiral, and with the release of this, it is evident to me that a change is nowhere near the horizon. What made me such a fan of the first two albums was the aggressiveness and creativity and was unlike any other Metal (if you want to call it that) album that I have ever heard. The first two albums had so much creativity for  example  the jazz breaks followed by the insane Trash breaks in \\"Sugar\\" or the beautiful, yet so dark \\"Aerials\\" What in the hell happened to this band. Even Steal this album, which I know was a collection of B-Sides was better. This band has seemed to lose its CREATIVITY. I understand that a band is entitled to change, and maybe they wanted to move away of the direction of the sheer heaviness of the first two albums. I also dont want to sound like an ignorant metal head and say \\"well if it slows down, or its to mellow it sucks\\" Look at the classic Def Tones album \\"White Pony\\" It lacked the edge and aggressiveness of \\"Adrenlin\\" but it was way more creative, and as it turned out (at least in my mind) it was the best album the Def Tones did. I think this band needs to restructure themselves and worry about selling less albums and writing better material, regardless of what style they choose. FM pop laden tracks are not what this band should be about. They are way to talented to waste their time with simple songs. Hopefully they will get back to their roots and give us something to smile about.
B0001HAISG|5.0|This movie stands on its own as a family film, an action/adventure movie, and as a play adaptation. <br /> <br />Exceptional as a family film, it has all the necessary elements to hold the attention of both parent and child (without resorting to anachronistic pop-culture references). <br /> <br />Although presented as a story set in a real world, it doesn't insult your intelligence when the fantastical elements inevitably take over. Besides, one does not watch Peter Pan for reality. We enjoy the ride. The CGI plays an important role, but is integrated so well that you never get the feeling you're watching a cartoon. <br /> <br />As an adaptation of the play, any liberties taken with J.M. Barrie's work serve to enhance the story within the film medium while giving due homage to the original. <br /> <br />In the bigger picture, it was during my first viewing of this that I realized genius of the Pan/Hook/Mr. Darling trinity. The story is more than just that, what J.M. Barrie has given us, and what J.P. Hogan translated so well, is the definition of the male psyche. I'd explain more of what I mean, but I'd have to write a book - in fact, I may do just that.
0060872675|4.0|I love this one for reading to my son.  My wife has not read discworld and jsut doesn't get it, but the little boy does and that's all that matters.  It's great to read something quite a bit different than the normal rhymes & animals!
0375836675|5.0|Having read \\"The Book Thief\\" by the same author and enjoying it, I was eager to read this book.  Zusak has a quirky, different and extremely readable style.  \\"I Am the Messenger\\" did not disappoint.  In fact, I enjoyed this book even more than \\"The Book Thief.\\"  Zusak captures your attention from page one to the end of the book.  I could not put this book down, and the story has stayed with me for months after. The book is funny, poignant, meaningful, and thought provoking.  I lent the book to my 23 year old daughter who also loved it and passed it on to her mother-in-law.  This book has a message for anyone and everyone.  \\"I Am the Messenger\\" will make you laugh, cry, and never forget it.
0618680004|5.0|Very readable, witty and erudite book. The many clever quotations ranging from  Mencken to Twain are wonderful. I was shocked but delighted to see the extended Barry Goldwater quote where he warns political preachers against trying to dictate his conscience. My opinion of Barry shot up dramatically.  <br /> <br />I know others have and will dissect the details of the book better than I, but I will just say it is a wide-ranging book that discusses such diverse topics as cargo cults, religious behavior as an evolutonary by-product, origins of morality, cosmic multiverses and Smolin's black hole ideas, and the extreme implausibility of God.  <br /> <br />While it may not convince everyone, I think it should give everyone much to think about.
B000001FFJ|3.0|Tom Waits has always been a \\"fringe performer\\" almost like a poetically structured, gravel voiced Alice Cooper with a pork pie hat. Tom goes back a long time and in my view has always been the type of recording artist that you would have to listen to his tracks three times before his genius sank in. He is all about delivery, lyrical adroitness and persona.<br /><br />Rain Dogs is definitely a sound investment especially if you have followed Tom's ever evolving and captivating careeer because it exhibits a good mix of what he has accomplished. I will never forget the heavily covered tune Downtown Train which I consider to be far and away his jewel. It's a song that has an exceptional melody and unforgetable lyrics and especially meaningful to a good old NYC boy like me (all those Brooklyn girls). Incidently, I believe Patty Smythe of Scandal did a more memorable and forceful cover rendition than the iconic Rod Stewart did. That song to me is a masterpiece and a good indication that Tom Waits has always been an innovator and an artist on the outside looking in.<br /><br />Jay Adler, CD Reviewer, Massapequa, New York

B000GRTQSE|5.0|I was never a Bob Dylan fan.  Only started listening to him when I married a big fan.  Due to atrition, so to speak, I started enjoying some, not all of his work.  I bought Modern Times for the BIG Dylan fan that I am married to.  This new CD is GREAT!  I really am enjoying the music and lyrics.  I am actually considering buying a second CD for my car.  I have suddenly and surprisingly become a Bob Dylan Fan.  I highly recommend Modern Times.
0937381888|4.0|Overall, this is a really good book; it is very complete.  The author even gives results from fluid dynamics experiments he ran with a mash tun.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I felt that the all-grain brewing section (\\"Your First All-Grain Beer\\") could have been a little more detailed.  I got lost at times when brewing it.  Aside from that, though, the book helped me build a mash/lauter tun and get a good idea of how to successfuly all-grain brew.  It also gives recipes and methods for inventing your own beers.

B00003CX96|5.0|Great movie with young actors that are still out there making movies. This coming of age movie is clean and yet very real now as it was then. The names and places have changed but the truth still applies. Highly recommended, somewhat predictable but still very enjoyable. There are enough characters that one of them must apply to someone in your group.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A truly incredible series.  I discovered it a year or two ago on the sci-fi channel and then went to see Serenity (Firefly's movie sequel) and Joss Whedon is a genius.  This show is one of those perfect little gems that become cult hits. <br /> <br />Like Whedon's other series, it manages to be light and dark at the same time, dealing with some pretty deep and terrifying subjects but managing to be light-hearted and funny at the same time.  Much of the dialog is very humorous and joking, even when discussing very serious things and this manages to prevent it from becoming too depressing. <br /> <br />The characters, with all their quirks, are all lovable, despite their differences.  The sci-fi aspects of it are actually fairly minimal, as most of the plots have more to do with things that could be set in any time line.  The fact that all of these occur in space is just a coincidence (or so it seems). <br /> <br />Anyone who likes sci-fi should give Firefly a chance, and even those who don't might find it to be a show they like.

We found it thoroughly entertaining while quenching your desire for drama, comedy and suspense. As with all series, we prefer some characters over others, but we found that the cast was well suited for bonding with the show and we can't wait for Season two to become available on DVD.

B000FIMG68|5.0|If you are a LOST fan and if you are reading this you probably are, watching the season sans commercials is the best. I had not seen season one or two and caught up this summer and fall with both on DVD. I wish I had the strength to wait till next fall to watch season three, the commercials are suspense killers.
B00005JPBP|5.0|The Prestige<br /><br />I thought this was great the first time around, but the second time only deepened my appreciation for it.  This is a phenomenal piece of cinema.  Christopher Nolan and Dody Dorn improve upon many of the startling editing, structural, and narration techniques they solidified for Memento, but here serving the story rather than the other way around.  The character arcs, call-backs, and use of dialog are thrilling.  Magic, and all the concepts surrounding it, including the double meaning of \\"the prestige\\", are intertwined intrinsically.  This may have come from the novel, but it's a feat to translate anything so complicated with such purity when adapting forms.  I found this film to mesh organically into itself with nary a self-conscious or contrived air to be found.  While there were a few times I wished there was a tad more fire, spark, or intensity to the delivery in key scenes, the tone was always dead-on from the talent and I never found it unbelievable.  David Bowie and Christian Bale, in particular, give remarkably nuanced performances...right down to one of the final whispers.  I was also impressed with Hugh Jackman's final scene in the film, and how earlier he made such a perfect showman.  The cinematography & lighting no doubt had a lot to do with it, but I'll give him credit for really filling out the role.  Make sure to see this before it leaves the theaters, in an auditorium with good, loud sound, tight fine focus, and a bright lamp.  You'll regret it later if the first time you see it is at a cineplex run by incompetents or, god forbid, on DVD.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Pixar has struck gold one again with this teriffic movie that's sure to become a classic. <br /> <br />Lightning McQueen(Owen Wilson) is the hottest rookie car on the Piston Cup Circuit, but he's facing a challenge from two other cars: The King (Richard Petty) and Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton).  All three cars are tied going into the final race of the season.  By the end of the race, McQueen has a huge lead over Hicks and The King, but he made a decision not to change tires earlier in the race.  Now, he suffers a blowout, allowing Hicks and The King to catch up.  The race ends in a three-way tie.  It is decided that there will be one winner-take-all race at the Los Angeles International Speedway the following week.  The three cars set off on their cross-country journey. <br /> <br />Lightning is riding happily along in the back of his trailer when suddenly, something goes wrong.  Lightning finds himself out of his trailer and in the middle of a crowded interstate.  Meanwhile, his tractor/trailer keeps driving, not realizing Lightning is missing.  Lightning ends up in the sleepy town of Radiator Springs, on Route 66. <br /> <br />Lightning's problems begin as soon as he enters town.  He ends up destroying the town's main road, is arrested by the sheriff, and impounded and booted in the town's impound lot.  In the lot, he meets Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), an old tow truck.  Then, he's taken to the courthouse, where Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) sentences lightning to fix the road before he'll be allowed to go on to his race in California.  There are other interesting cars in Radiator Springs, including Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt), a hot-looking Porsche who runs the town hotel, Sarge the army jeep, and Flo, owner of Flo's V8 Cafe.  Radiator Falls used to be a bustling town, but since the interstate was built, very few travellers drive through. <br /> <br />Lightning begins his job of re-paving the road and he finishes rather quickly, but Doc is unsatisfied with his work, sohe tells Lightning to start over.  Frustrated, Lightning begins again.  However, something unexpected has been happening.  Lightning finds himself developing friendships with each car in Radiator Springs, especially Sally. Mater has taken a special liking to Lightning, even taking him tractor tipping. Mater calls Lightning his best friend. He also finds out that Doc is hiding a secret of his own from everyone in town.  Soon, the road is finished, and Lightning is free to go to his race in California.  But he's having second thoughts.  Sally took him for a drive, and Lightning was impressed with the beautiful scenery.  Sally also tells him about how Radiator Springs used to be a hub of activity and how she wishes it would be that way again.  Lightning even gets some new tires and a new paint job.  He doesn't look like the race car he was before. <br /> <br />Just as it looks like Lightning has made up his mind to stay in Radiator Springs, the town is besieged by other cars and helicopters, along with Lightning's own truck.  They scoop him up and wisk him off to the race in California, leaving his friends in Radiator Springs surprised and Lightning sad.  Once at the track, Lightning, Hicks, and The King start their race.  The only member in Lightning's pit is his faithful truck, until he hears the voice of Doc Hudson.  All of his friends from Radiator Springs have come to help him. <br /> <br />As for the race, Lightning has been trailing The King and Hicks the entire way.  As the race enters its final laps, Hicks slams into The King, causing him to crash on the infield.  Lightning, only inches from the finish line and the Piston Cup Championship, makes a decision that changes his life. <br /> <br />This is an excellent movie.  Pixar Studios has turned out some fine animated movies in recent years, but this is one of the best.  The story is both exciting and heartwarming, and its fun to watch Lightning learn that there's more to life than winning races and getting big sponsorships.  Friendship and trust are just as important.  Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, Larry the Cable Guy, Michael Keaton, and Richard Petty bring the animated cars to life in a style that is funny, and you'll find yourself cheering for each one.  Jay Leno, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Dale Waltrip, Mario Andretti, and Bob Costas lend their talents to the collection of cars, too. <br /> <br />I give this movie my highest recommendation.  Children and adults will enjoy this revved-up and exciting movie.  Ka Chow!
B000J6I0U2|3.0|Heath Ledger is an introspective Casanova in this otherwise outrageously amusing conglomeration of events and characters. CASANOVA does not fail to entertain. Oliver Platt as the \\"Lard King of Genoa\\" definitely steals this film from the entire cast as a corpulent suitor. This is one of his best performances leaving an indelible mark for his range of histrionics. Also, Jeremy Irons once again demonstrates his mastery of for the dramatics as the Vatican's grand inquisitor sent to finally put the issue of Casanova to rest. Starting off as a powerful character he ends up in some outrageous buffoonery showing a new side of his array talents. The film is vastly amusing starting slowly but coming to a grand crescendo.
B000AA4LAK|4.0|I heard some of these songs on Rockstar Supernova, so I decided to buy the album. I have enjoyed it very much, but must confess that the songs thast were on TV were the best ones.
B000F3TBIO|5.0|I'm amazed.  This guy [Mike Patton] does have a range of musical interests, and some of the stuff can be difficult for people to \\"get\\", but this album is both accessible and still has that uniqueness Patton fans will love. <br /> <br />I was skeptical, and I really like this album.  [Norah Jones is good on it too :-) ]
B0001AVZA8|5.0|The MOST entertaining movie I have seen in a long time.  It's a movie I can watch more than once - and have.
B0000640SE|5.0|It is fun to watch this movie scene by scene backwards: starting from the last scene to the first.
B000G7PMD2|5.0|If you like Dream Theater even for a tiny little bit, you most defiately must buy this album. With a real orchestra , which brings out the best in the band and the songs in which this orcchestra performs.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|These DVDs are great.  The show is spectacular.  I resisted watching it as it aired as I don't usually go in for the whole horror genre...but this show is so much more. <br /> <br />The DVD set is well done and includes wonderful extras.  Don't miss the gag reel or the two small easter eggs.  Really well produced season wrap-up.  Excellent quality set. <br /> <br />And, yes, now I'm totally hooked on the show and it's part of my must see tv...so beware that possibility!
0792164903|4.0|It was interesting to see this film.  Christopher Walken was great as teh headless horseman. Of course Johhny Depp was as cute as ever.  Christina Ricci was good also.  The special effects were good too. Johnny Depp portrail as Ichabod Crane was good.
0793518326|5.0|I have bought this book for my son. I can not tell anything myself, but he is very happy. <br />As far as Amazon.com, everything was just perfect. Fast delivering, as usually, and product was new as promissed.
B000FIMG68|5.0|LOST is an absolutely riveting show that I was introduced to during Season 2.  So, I watched Season 1 during Season 2 and then bought the second on Amazon after it came out.  The show is remarkable, with the most intricate plot lines and mysteries and very developed characters.  You won't find a flat one in the bunch.  Although it tends to twist and turn maybe a little too much and can be irritatingly intricate at times, it is definitely worth the watch.  And Amazon had the best price around!  Thanks!
0060899190|5.0|I've long been a fan of the PostSecret website, and decided to get the book simpley because the idea is so powerful. This was my first ever coffee table book, and it's been a great conversation piece.  <br />The secrets it features range from humorous to deathly serious. It's a great read with friends or alone. I highly recommend this book to anyone human, because you will find yourself contained in its pages.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|I have been a Bob Dylan fan since the 60's. Hard as it is to imagine, this is trhe best of him that I have ever heard. I can't stop playing it.
B000003N7K|5.0|What a gift to the jazz-loving world!  I hadn't realized that Coltrane and Hartman had recorded together.  The tones each of these musicians produce, along with the interpretations, and the choice of material -- oh, not to mention the sidemen-- make this such an amazing recording. The old Irving Berlin \\"They Say it's Wonderful\\"  as well as \\"My One and Only Love\\"  are my two favorites. I'm so lucky to have found it.
B000FIMG68|5.0|This is an awesome show.  I purchase the DVD's because I don't have the time to watch the show during it's regularly scheduled time (and I don't want to pay for Tivo or record all those commercials). <br />The \\"special features\\" could be better, but I only purchase the Discs to watch the show.
B000FIMG68|5.0|There just isn't enough to say about this series... and the boxed set(s) are even better! Between the extras, no commercials and freeze-frame, the set is a Lost-junkie's dream...!
B000FL7CAK|5.0|I would stay up half the night watching episode after episode! I kept wanting to know what was going to happen. It kept my interest the whole time.
B0001907DA|4.0|disc 4 would not play on my DVD, it did however on my PS2
B000063JDE|1.0|I thought I was going to see something of Roy Orbinson.  It was only in the title of the name.  I could not watch it when it became vulgar with offensive material.  It is too bad to have a good story with great actors lowering its potentially good quality with such degrading vulgarity. There are better ways of getting this aspect of the story across with such depiction.  Silly me, I should have checked the rating.  I \\"assumed\\" it safe as it would involve our beloved Roy Orbinson.  I was sadly and horridly disappointed and cannot in conscience recommend it to anyone at anytime.  By the way,I destroyed the tape in good conscience.  Watch at your own eternal risk.
0393035158|4.0|Read this book, and maybe your administration wouldn't cause so much domestic strife (i.e hatred toward gays) among various individuals here in these United States.  This is a true reasoned analysis of the dangers of dogmatic fundamentalism.  Our president needs to understand the divisions he has caused.
B000024A70|5.0|I love this CD as it contains all the best hits of the grpoup especially Bohemian Rhapsody.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|This film was ground breaking in the use of Technicolor film.  The excellent cinematography combined with great performances by the actors and a classic story make this a true timeless masterpiece that has already outlived all of those who made it. <br />
B000BTC5LW|4.0|\\"Pulse\\" on DVD is a delightful, 4-hour trip back in time to the great days of British art rock.  The video production values suffer a bit as a result of coming from an analog source with a 4:3 aspect ratio, but the audio quality is second to none.   <br /> <br />The Floyd mounted a light show like no other band in rock's recent memory, and what you see on screen during the encore track, \\"Comfortably Numb\\", surpasses just about all the chemically-induced psychedelic visions this writer experienced some decades ago.   <br /> <br />Hey, Boomer parents: Buy this set as a gift for your rap-infested, Beyonce-addicted teenagers, and show them how REAL musicians put on a live show, back in the day!
B000001EMW|5.0|The music is wonderful.  It's one of the few CDs that I will regularly leave in the car, and I love the look of surprise on people's faces when they realize that it's Metallica. <br />I'll be picking up some of the other Apocalyptica albums for gifts this Christmas.
B000683VI4|5.0|This is a love story personified.  And I am sure this goes on in real life every minute of every day.  This is what LOVE really is.  . . . in sickness and in health till death us do part.  And I do not believe it ends there.  So if you want to know what LOVE really is - watch this movie or read the book.  It is fantastic.
8590379825|5.0|this book does a great job of getting you going and filling your head with lots of neat ideas pretty quickly. <br /> <br />wish i had discovered lua a few years back when i was working on a project that needed an embedded scripting language.
0553382179|5.0|This book is great.  Not just for stay at home moms but for us working moms too.  The cleaning and organizing tips are great and the program is flexible to adjust to each person's schedule.
B000002UAF|5.0|This is John Lennon at his best as a Beatle.  George Harrison is excellent with \\"I should have known better\\", one of my favorite Beatle tunes of all time.  It is fun, upbeat and romantic.  I never get tired of listening to it.
074325144X|5.0|I am missing the ACL on the left side and never expected to be able to run again.  After using this method with 5 months of training, I was able to complete a marathon.  It is easy to read and quite clear, although I recommend getting the video too.   <br /> <br />B
B00008DDSC|5.0|I saw this in the theater - I really like it for its offbeat characters and humor on a dark subject.  It did realistically portray the phenomenon of self-injury as an addiction, based on my experience as a therapist.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I was pleased with this purchase. It arrived in a timely manner.
0060853964|5.0|Brilliant. Completley and utterly brilliant. Good Omens written by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman are hilarious and witty in this joint venture. The prose is seamless, you can't tell who wrote what because the writing styles meld into each other. The wit is what you would expect from the dynamic duo. For those who have a sense of humor and find blasphemy hilarious or at least funnt, this book is highly recommended. I never thought the apocalypse would be so modern and funny.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|What a paring!! Some things were just meant to be.   Mark Knoffler is by far my favorite singer/songwriter . And his sensitivity and technique as a guitarist is second to none.   I especially love his work since his Dire Straits dayz.  And Emmy Lou???   what more can be said about her?  This alblum is the best thing I've heard in years ,. Not a bad cut on it, it's continually on my jukebox!!!!!!!!
0446677450|5.0|This book is a must read and I'm mad at myself for not purchasing it earlier.  It taught me so many things which I plan to put in the works soon. HIGHLY RECOMEND IT!!! <br /> <br />Monica Perez
0345403959|5.0|I love this book. This is my second copy.  I have re-bought all of the Eddings series as they have worn out over the years.
0694013889|2.0|I thought this book was too long and involved for my 18 month old.  She won't sit still long enough to read it through.  I like \\"The Potty Book - For Girls (or Boys)\\" better as it is shorter but still gets the point across.  This book would be good if you were potty-training a three year old...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Whoever heard of a western in space? Well, the creators of the Galaxy Rangers of the 1980s did, and, apparently, Joss Whedon approved. <br /> <br />Whedon's Firefly series is one of the greatest TV shows I've ever seen! Unfortunately, it was cancelled after only one season, which I believe is due mostly to FOX's poor advertising for the show. The fans are now pushing for a return, but it seems unlikely. <br /> <br />Captain Mal Reynolds and his crew on board the ship Serenity are some of the best creations to ever come out of the mind of Joss Whedon- and that's saying something! This show has everything: comedy, suspense, action, horror, and romance. It's one of the few genre-hopping programs to ever be on television and actually not make me want to change the channel. The characters are very diverse in nature: a captain/former soldier, his lieutenant turned second-in-command/wife, a pilot/husband/comedic element, a mercenary (the all brawns/no brains of the ship), a female, highly-sexual, innocent mechanic, a \\"shepherd\\" (aka preacher), a \\"Companion\\" (upscale geisha/prostitute of the future), and a doctor and his mysterious, seemingly psychotic sister. The chemistry between all the actors is fantastic; you really believe they care about one another and the ship they inhabit.  <br /> <br />In the midst of trying to earn a living in the smuggling business, and working with some rather unscrupulous but very entertaining men and women, Mal and his crew try to figure out just who Doctor Tam and his sister, River, really are and what they're looking for. It's a story of family, beatings, friends, space travel, love, whores, doing the right thing, illegal dealings, marriages, divorces, and loyalty and it will forever go down in my movie inventory as not-to-be-missed!
0525948023|5.0|Wonderfully written! He takes the spirituality of the life experience of a person in the Now and clearly identifies the struggle of Ego vs.True Self living. This is a must read for the serious fellow Path walker. Thank you Mr. Tolle.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Josh Groban continues to entertain us with his wonderful talent as a great singer.  He hits all those notes at his best and with great style. <br />You won't be disappointed in buying this CD. <br /> <br />
1592401791|5.0|This is the best book I've ever read on the Beatles.  It gives you insight after insight as to how they worked, and gives you a history of the Abbey Road studio that flawlessly integrates into the story.  This book was a pure delight to read and I found it difficult to put down.  I can't praise it highly enough.  It's that good.
B000F6IOC0|2.0|The sequel, Underworld - Evolution is moderately entertaining but not quite as good as the original.
1592401791|4.0|A great story for those who are interested in how records are made. Emerick makes you feel like you're in the little recording room with the Beatles as he explains how they created certain sounds. As he describes those songs you've heard a thousand times, you'll gain new insight on the sounds you've taken for granted (for example the innovative steps required to create the bass sound on Paperback Writer). There is some coverage of the personalities and the infighting, but only to the extent necessary to decribe how it affected the recording/writing process. <br />My only disappointment in the book was the surpisingly brief description of the process of recording the Free As a Bird & Real Love tracks for the Beatles Anthology. Given the unique situation of recording Lennon songs without Lennon, there's little discussion of the engineering and production - only a description of the vibe and the mood as they worked on it. That bit aside, a great story about groundbreaking achievements in recording as well as songwriting.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|John Mayer is better than ever in this album.  Although, he seems to have exchanged a bit of his sweetness for sour - one can tell he may have had troubles in his love life!  Nevertheless, this album has soul, and I can't wait for the next one!
630463949X|5.0|Awonderfully done video of one of the most significant rock concerts of all time.
0064471837|5.0|Eighteen year-old Sabriel lives at a boarding school in Ancelstierre, a mundane world that seems reminiscent of England (or Australia) in the early twentieth century.  Across the nearby Wall (and garrison that mixes medieval and WWI-era weapons and uniforms) lies the Old Kingdom, place of anarchy and magic where technology will not work.<br /><br />Sabriel gets a message that something has happened to her father, a famous necromancer.  She, a necromancer-in-training, must go into the Old Kingdom and rescue him.  On the way, she is helped by a chaotic spirit, and a prince who has slept for 200 years.<br /><br />The author has a pure and pared-down writing style like LeGuin's in Earthsea.  Also, his magic is believable on the Earthsea level in its realism:  the complexity of its details, and the simplicity of its description.  Charter Magic is like the Tao or the Force.<br /><br />The necromancy has the chilling Gates and Precincts one passes through in the land of the dead, and the different bells used by necromancers to manipulate the dead.  In addition, the military stuff of Ancelstierre forms a pleasing contrast with the magic Old Kingdom.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Since the beginning, Lost has been one of my favorite shows.  Since I often work nights, I wasn't able to always see it.  This collection saved the day! <br />I am able to watch my favorite show when it's convenient to me.  Love it!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed this DVD.  It was interesting to get the opinions and side comnets of the Actors.  I also liked that I could catch parts of the stories that I may have missed the first time around.  The DVD's are also very easy to navigate when watching and episode at a time. I just love the Urban Legend theme of this series!!!
B000I5X81K|4.0|I rate this 4 stars because and only because it is missing the two bonus tracks.  You HAVE to get the one w/ the bonus tracks.  That album would be a 5.  The two bonus tracks, which are not on this album, are the title track \\"Awake\\" and \\"Verita\\", probably the two best songs on the album.  So if you are going to get the album, be sure to get the one w/ the bonus track and DVD. Otherwise, vintage Josh Groban.  Still a good album.  Would be great album w/ the bonus tracks.
B000683VI4|5.0|get this one! I was forced into watching it by my girlfirend but after only maybe 10-15 minutes I was really interested in seeing what happened next. I have been forced to watch a few other romance films in my time and this one I actually enjoyed. If your girl has given you a list of romance movies she wants for gifts and you know your going to end up having to watch them with her, do yourself a favor and get this.
B0000797IO|4.0|Girls, no need to make your man sit through this one with you! He probably wouldn't get it anyway :).....It is a definite keeper! I've watched it several times...If you are a Jennifer Aniston fan, then this movie is worth it!
0553266306|5.0|I read this one when I worked night time weekend doorman at the Pantheon theatre in downtown Toledo where they showed macho Black Cinema films (they called them this in a communications class in college) and even the mamger Jack Kinger carried a .38 with a shoulder holster.<br /><br />In this environment, I read this book in off times on my job. It fascinated me. How the assasin, the Jackal, had a high powered rifle custom built to fit in a fake crutch to attempt to kill DeGull. Nothing against France. He disassenbled it and then put it back together when he was ready to use it. The part at the end was cetrainly suspenseful to me. I was shiocked to find that the French intelligence used electrodes on the genitals to interrogate supsects in an assanation plot against the president.The end was cetainly a cliffhanger. And back then I enjoyed it a great deal. Yet later, I had seen the movie version and PBS and it was quite droll. The book was better than the movie.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|So much better than the first, by far one of the best sci-fi movies ie seen in a while
B000001Y79|5.0|No Doubt's Tragic Kingdom is really a great album and worth your money. Literally every track on it is well done. In my opinion its the last good No Doubt album. My personal favorite song is The Climb, mainly because its written in 12/8 as opposed to 4/4 time, like most popular music. Unfortunately, every other song on the album is 4/4, but it is something of a treat to hear something different. This album is really good all around and everyone can like at least one track on this album.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Granted the movie is very different from the book...but that's to be expected because books are always 100x more detailed than what can be allowed for a movie. HOWEVER they do a very good job at trying to keep as much as they could and keep the story strong. I know some people are Jane Austin purists and don't like this movie because it's not exactly like the book. My advice to them is to STOP WATCHING MOVIES! They're probably more resentful that a movie version was made to begin with because naturally not everything makes it into the movie. I have read the book and I still love this movie. <br /> <br />I wasn't sure about seeing it, but I am a fan of Keira Knightley and figured I'd give it a watch as friends recommended it. Well I fell in love with the movie and bought it off of Amazon and I've watched it at least 20 times (that's probably a conservative figure). The story is beautiful, the cast is full of great actors, the scenes are well executed. I'm a HUGE fan of Keira now, she did great. <br /> <br />Great movie...highly recommend for anyone with at least a little romantic spirit in them. :)
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|Was an aswome movie, the english trasnlation made it easyer to follow and the extras were impressive.  Some of the vioces were lost in translation, but the new voices used in place of them was fitting enoughf that unless you watched the jap version too many times you'd never notice.  I strongly sudgest this movie for anyone who has even a spark of intrest in FFVII.
0895260131|5.0|Robert Spencer does an outstanding job in succintly explaining why Islam is a dangerous religion.  It is not suprising that the majority of adherents probably do not truly understand or know Islamic Dogma.  I've spent a number of years living in Turkey and have traveled through the Middle East extensively.  I know a many people who are \\"cultural\\" muslims, that is to say they were born and brought up in the religion.  Most of these folks did not attend the Mosque on a regular basis and they tended to lead secular lives.  This would include the education their daughters through the university level and beyond.  It is my opinion that they had no idea of what is written in the Koran or the Hadiths and would probably find some of the tenets of Islam to be abhorrent.  The sad truth is that my friends in Turkey did not speak Arabic.  That alone would severely limit their understanding of religion.  Until I read Spencer's book, I too, was counted in the camp of the Islamic apologists.  Many of the facts provided by Mr Spencer I knew already, but I had never really put them into context.  My eyes have been opened, Thank You Mr. Spencer.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I finally had a chance to watch the series.  I was very sad to get to the last episode and know it would be over.  I don't watch a lot of TV - mostly HBO series like Deadwood, etc.  I rate this as some of the best TV I've ever seen.  I'm now a huge fan.  Hard to understand how a studio could be so wrongheaded.  I've got to watch Serenity the movie again now that I've got the backstory in place.   <br />Enjoy!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I was skeptical of the WB's show last season, until I gave the show a chance. It was so good. Unfortunately, I jumped in too late. I was so pleased with the DVDs. The bonus features are fantastic. I loved the commentary by Ackles and Padalecki, you can tell they get along extremely well. The blooper reel at the end is worth buying the set alone. The show's mytharc is easy to get into and enjoy its development throughout the season.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|It is a must for fans of the video-game \\"Fainal Fantasy VII\\". <br />Come on and get it! <br /> <br />There is nothing more about to say.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|I couldn't be happier with this CD/DVD.  Excellent mood throughout.  The DVD is great.  I especially love Cold Irons Bound.  Dylan is Dylan and one of my favorites of all time.  Also, do yourself a favor and check out some Billy Joe Shaver CDs.  Maybe \\"The Earth Rolls On\\" for starters.
B00005OMTT|5.0|I bought \\"Love, Sensuality Devotion: The Greatest Hits\\" on recommendation from someone else.  The music is so different and so powerful and so well engineered I just love it and would highly recommend this CD to anyone who wants a powerful musical expereince!
B00004U2GH|5.0|Another great album from one of the all time greatest country singers to have graced our lives.  His music will live on forever.
0316287059|5.0|I loved all the books by Kevyn. He knows what he is doing, shows how to do a make up job to look like a particular celebrity. I suggest this book to give some simple solutions to everyday problems, shading, proper technique, much valuable info.
B000028U0Y|5.0|Great music from one of the greatest country singers of our time.  With his wife June Carter Cash, their music is legendary.
0743289412|1.0|I really love King's work but the reason always was, because of how much he knew what scared us all.  It seems that now he has put out too many books about authors and their horrors, that these must be the things that scare him.  I really would like a book from him again, that scares me.  This one isn't it.
B0000524EM|4.0|The Crow (Collector's Series Boxed Set) consists of the first three of four in the series. Although all three have the same theme, each is quite different and exciting.
0399230033|5.0|My son really enjoyed this book.  Plus, it lends itself for children to help make up the story after several readings.
0393327655|4.0|The difficulty of a book such as \\"The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason,\\" by Sam Harris, is that the reader's reaction to it is probably shaped by views already held. Harris contends that the existence of organized religion is a deadly epoch in humanity's history, one that we must outgrow in order to survive and flourish. Faith in a sentient deity itself, he argues, is incompatible with rationality.  <br /> <br />The book is strongest in its cataloguing of the well known horrors, historical and current, committed in the name of someone's God. He also argues persuasively that even religious moderates can remain religious only be ignoring the calls to violence and divisiveness appearing in sacred texts of all creeds, and by interpreting or rationalizing those words away with experience gained from our collective secular experiences. He legitimately questions why a person's religious beliefs, as opposed for example, one's political beliefs, are beyond challenge and criticism in our society. His critique of Islam, devoid of any hint of political correctness, is potent. <br /> <br />Harris is at his weakest when he implies that with the end of religious faith, the worst of man's depredations will end. He strains unpersuasively to to argue that even secular tyrants such as Hitler and Stalin, gained their traction via religious beliefs. The book is further weakened by a meandering section on the nature of consciousness, as if he needed to fill 30 more pages. Harris' arguments are the logical extension of secular humanism, a belief that justice and compassion are within the human province and not dependent on religious faith. Anyone open to the notion that religious faith is a passing phase of a young species, needs to read this book - preceded or followed of course, by the Old Testament, New Testament, and Koran.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|I am a Judy Garland fan,and have never seen a bad Judy Garland movie. However--if I were to be asked to name 3 of my favorites,Meet Me In St. Louis would be among the 3. Maybe even 1st. Great family movie. Great music. And Judy--at her best. Wow! How can you beat that!? If you like Judy,or like musicals--buy it! You'll not be sorry.

B000GFLAI0|5.0|Bob Dylan has proven to be such an icon in music and poetry that it's always amazing when he is able to best himself. <br />Most people never understood his voice 40 years ago and to the average ear, one would say that it has gotten worse.  But to a fan and devotee to the times and a message, his voice has only improved with age. <br />I am so pleased each and every time that I play this CD that it is quite easy to understand his critique of the current music scene. <br />Keep it up Bob!
B000002L68|5.0|I have hestitated to write a review on \\"Purple Rain\\" for years because     1. I listened to this album for 4 years everyday (1984- 1988) and never  knew what it truly was.    2. In many ways it has made the most profund change in me as a person.    3. Because underneath of it's sexuality is the greatest Christian Rock Album of the modern era.      4. And also one of the greatest musical statments of the Rock Era.    In many ways Prince and the Revolution's \\"Purple Rain\\" was the extension of the classic Sly and the Family lineup (whom he takes probaly his greatest inspiration musically) and their second album together he leaves the Minneapolis Sound somewhat and instead of the Punk/Funk Nu Wave vibes of 1999 he opts for Power Pop like  The Who and The Kinks on songs like \\"Let Go Crazy\\" is a classic clash of synth pop with Townsend -like Guitar chrouses but the lyrics start with him either in prayer in a thearpists chair with a traditonal gospel intro talking about the 'afterworld' or insanity (much like Marvin Gaye lyrically at his best)  and with those Minneapolis synths of Coleman and Dr. Fink swirling and vamping about, the song becomes power pop heaven for guitar freaks and the lyrics which captures lust, salvation and insanity with it's perfect guitar solos and the end with it's cathraic release siginals that we are not only listening to a soundtrack but at it's core a Christian Rock Album but it doesn't sound like a Newsboys, Amy Grant or DC Talk album because unlike those groups, Prince talks about the flesh in ways that these artists would never broach on an album.     Side one (I have it on vinyl,cd and tape) after the insanity of Let's Go Crazy is the great pop of Take Me with U with it's great arrangement and while Appolonia is vocally limited, she turns in a great performance on this song and Prince being the great singer could have overwhelmed her vocally but he stays in her range \\"The Beautiful Ones\\" The only R&B sounding song on side one, is a beautiful declaration of love to his Girlfriend at the time Susanah Melvion. In his best Smokey Robinson/Curtis Mayfield/Eddie Kendricks falsetto he pleads with great tenderness in verse     \\"If I told U Baby If I was in love with U   Baby Baby Baby We could Married would that cool    In the last verses he demands she makes a chocie    Do U want him ? Or Do U want me cause I want U  Tell Me Baby Do U WANT ME  !!!! I gotta know I gotta Know    Computer Blue is probaly the most Song that is Hendrix/Funkadelic in spirit lyrically and in musical exceution with it's Wendy and Lisa sapphic intro bathing each other into the most insane Prince guitar jam it his sexual id run amuck musically with the lyric \\"Til I Find the Righteous One Computer Blue\\" with The Revolution jamming along Prince plays some of the best solos I have ever him play with it's Eddie Hazel - like first solo before the breakdown into a Ernie Isley-like second (whom I think Prince sounds like )melodic solo til the insane ending with him screaming like a banshee then it fades into the most controvesial song on the whole album , \\"Darling Nikki\\" (the reason there are Parental Advisory Tags on every album)is about a visit to a hotel to see a girl who was a 'sex fiend'  and a song that while quite tame for today still only gets played late at night because of the lyric mastrubastion.  I always thought the guitars had a Led Zeppelin vibe at the time but as I have listened to more Black Alternative Albums it sounds like Funkadelic in it's prime.    Side Two (I know I am still doing the vinyl thing) is where you really see the Spritual side come out from the opener 'When Doves Cry' a musical and artistic acheivement with it's lack of bassline the song sounds like a sexual peacan about a woman, but it is actually about  hwo one dominates or gives up control in their interpersonal and romantic relationships with really cold and dark lyrics with the lament of \\"This is what it sounds like When Doves Cry\\" even when Prince isnot singing about sex it bleeds through the lyrics it really is a sad song in many ways but the guitar brillance keeps the song lite. \\"I would Die 4 U \\" is a great pop/funk song about faith under the quise of sexuality of God as a woman, a man or something you can't even fathom. Me and my friends couldn't believe at the time Prince was talking about God in all those mainfestions with the chrous \\"I would die 4 u Baby I'm a Star  is actually the most classic Minneapolis Sounding song with those classic keyboard vamps with that chant \\"Doctor\\" with Dr. Fink's great keyborad solo and then the finale of \\"Purple Rain \\" in which he takes a Marvin Gaye staple remdemption where he ties but impluses but marries them in a godly realm it is lyrically a double endtree you can say he's talk about himself as a woman's savoiur but it can also be about the power of God into one's life. After watching the movie and concert you realize years later that this album at it's heart is a ode to God and sex like many of his classic albums but it is the greatest Christian Rock album of all time because unlike those Christian Rock bands, they are never in touch with the world they are always trying to run away from those issues in their makes their music nothing but empty platitudes  unlike Prince who like Bob Marley and Marvin Gaye embraced the scared with the profane and came out with a masterwork for the ages.

0307237699|2.0|Senator Obama'a latest screed is a book about politics, common gound and reclaiming the American Dream. People looking for some deep thought that transcends our political, social, and foriegn policy issues are bound to be disapointed, especially if you are a progressive who swooned over his Speech at the Democratic Convention 2 years ago. The book breaks down into his childhood in Hawaii youthful indiscertions (a little coke, herb etc..) and the transition into the man he is today. Obama's centrism is really oft- putting to someone like me who feels that partisonship is a good idea (At least your enemies know where you stand)he would rather work the middle ground and find soloutions to our problems that are at it's heart does not lend itself to a 'gray area'.     The chapter I found on race is  typical Clinton doublespeak, As an Afro- American His appeal to 'universality' is trite at best because in one minute he knows he does not live an \\"authentic\\" cultural black expericence  Obama who is mixed is doing what Shelby Steele calls  \\" racial negotitating \\" making whites feel comfortable around someone like Obama who trusts that white america will do the right thing and he believes in the moral goodness of the majority white population and this country's ethos thereby he is liked for not challenging their morality. Obama tries to have it both ways empathizing with  the Afro- American and Hispanic  struggle (the vote he really needs to win election if he chooses to run for the Presidency)and he unlike many black intellectuals knows that the conservative movement used the symbols of the great society progress to butress their arguments in a \\"racial cold war\\". Obama fails when he lectures Latinos on Immirgration and by trying to find common ground he ends up alienating those who challenge this society's attitude about both blacks and Latinos.I think he is naive about race in this country, I for one do not trust the majority society to treat us with brotherhood and charity(after 389 years Afro- Americans ought to know better)I look at people as Enemies or Allies and white conservatives are the enemy of Afro- Americans or do we have to go to New Orleans for the Genocide (I see dead black people floating) they attempted last year.If Obama wants to negoitate with conservatives and find common ground that's his right, I would rather have power because it is the only thing White conservatives (and their minority allies) understand.    The last chapter he talks of his wife and her family that is the most touching thing in the whole book, his love for her seems genuine and you can tell he has empathy and concern for her and children in general. I feel that his book is just  and average at best. Maybe he might be President but he will not be the 'first black president'. But if you are a believer in Obama's charisma and think he can rise above petty politics and bring people of different races into a common American ideal then this book is for you, But if you do not like \\" Colorblind Centrists\\" like Obama and Harold Ford think they are weak 'Uncle Toms\\" then this book will to you be just average.
6305212112|5.0|This is a great story by Fannie Flagg. Its one I would like to believe is real, creates great emotions.  I've read several of this authors books, this is one of her best stories. Kathy Bates and Jessica Tandy are at their best.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|My teenage boys and I watch this movie any chance we get.  It is hillariously funny material, acted brilliantly by Ben Stiller.  We highly recommend this movie if you want a laugh.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I love POTC to begin with and the music just makes it come more alive. The only thing that I would change with it, but I would change it with any soundtrack is that the songs should be in order, although i could figure it out on my own. It's a must have.
1904920209|3.0|I expected different things from this book than what I received. Bertinet is a frenchman living in England, but instead of bringing his own bread culture to the english, he turned into an Englishman himself. The products in this book are oriented towards the English public. Yes, even the French traditional breads too. There are no baker's formulas not even metric weights! Everything is in English ounces, pounds and fluid ounces. The recipes are all simple both in the good and the bad meaning of the word. That is, they are easy to make, but they are lacking in taste. The reason is that the author uses almost exclusively the straight method for his breads ie mixing the dough, leaving it to double, cutting and shaping it, proofing and baking it, all in the space of about 2 hours! This is just not enough time for the dough to develop its taste. There are only a couple of recipes using the ferment method and none using sourdough. The breads do look good but their taste does not match their looks. I would give this book two stars if it wasn't for the beautiful photos and the DVD( which, by the way lasts only 22 minutes). If you want to bake beautiful looking, great tasting bread I suggest you get hold of \\"BREAD\\" by Jeffrey Hamelman or \\"The taste of bread\\" by Raymond Calvel.
B000AXSN5G|5.0|From the beginning of the first set you plunge into the Neil Young universe. I will not grade the sets. There are some that I associated within my life experiences and some not so much. His politics are aired / or are they masked. If you have ever liked Neil Young - BUY THIS ONE.
B000244FDW|4.0|I love the movie Pride and Prejudice directed by Simon Langton. It is wonderful, but I do not like the one directed by Cyril Coke.
B000GCFO0S|4.0|If you had really high expectations for this movie because it was a great video game series to you, then you might be looking for a different movie.  If you're looking for an entertaining, slightly corny horror movie to watch that has some really creepy moments, than this is a good choice for you.  It doesn't follow the video game series too well, but in its own right it has a great storyline.  Definitely better than a lot of B-rated horror movies out today, you can tell the budget was much higher.  Also, the Blu-Ray edition of this dvd is phenominal - the high def image is one of the most fantastic I've ever seen.  It really does bring this movie to life.
B000683VI4|4.0|ok even for a guy, I thought the hype might be a little more than it was worth, but to my amazement I thought is was a great story and lived up to all that I have reviewed.  I would suggest the movie to all.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|This is one of the best new shows to come on TV ever! It's the perfect combination of family, horror and humor. The CGI effects are excellent and the scares are truly creepy. This show is the first show I've become addicted to since Classic Star Trek and Dark Shadows in the 60's, early 70's. The episodes are fabulous to watch without commercials. I have watched everything four times and I want to watch it again! I commend the creator, Eric Kripke, for this show and the two actors Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki for doing such a good job with this. The pilot episode will simply hook you and you carry on from there. I highly recommend this DVD set to anyone who is a serious science fiction/horror fan.
B000FIMG68|5.0|i don't know if you are into this show or not, but have been hooked since the first episode! delivery was super fast too. i ordered it the monday before it was released and then i got the reminder that it could take 6 days for delivery. i was totally bummed and i regretted getting it just because it was cheaper online...BUT as it turns out Amazon got it to me by wednesday morning! i was super psyched!
0066620996|5.0|This is a great book for anyone who is interested in improving their business or educational system.  The book gets right to the point and doesn't throw around meaningless jargon.
B000EQ4G5K|3.0|Although her singles are catchy (even if SOS samples, but who doesn't sample these days?) or provocative (Unfaithful's lyrics are decent, but her voice features too much whine), what she lacks through most of the album is her own personality. Rihanna has, in some respects, sold out. Where's the reggae, calypso, salsa, etc? Okay, there IS some, but not nearly enough. The best part of this album? Sean Paul. I bet that single does well when it is released later. Her first album was definitely more original and more Rihanna.
B000FBGBPC|4.0|I had been waiting for their second album and it's as good as the first on. Best songs: \\"Animal I Have Become\\" and \\"Pain\\".
B0002EXH5E|1.0|Sorry Dave, but this is the worst MegadetH CD. <br /> <br />Also, I heard that a Country Music producer made this CD, so that kind-of tells you how this CD turned out. <br /> <br />You will only like this CD if you liked \\"Load\\" and \\"Reload\\" from MetallicA. <br /> <br />If you did not \\"Load\\" and \\"Reload\\" CDs, then you would not like this CD. <br /> <br />This CD is just as bad as the \\"No Prayer for the Dying\\" CD from Iron Maiden, and that CD is the worst Maiden CD ever made. <br /> <br />This CD in no way shows MegadetH's awesome guitar playing, drum playing, or bass playing skills. <br /> <br />You can skip this CD altogether and not be missing out on anything. <br /> <br />Go with the first 4 MegadetH CDs.  You can't go wrong with them.  \\"Youthenasia\\", \\"Countdown to Extinction\\", and \\"Rude Awakening\\" 2-CD set are very very good as well.
B000E6UK5K|3.0|Well, it's not a bad album of music, but after listening to it about three or four times, I found it getting less and less interesting with every listen, instead of the other way around. I love David Gilmour's style of guitar playing, but this is not the best thing he's done. Still and all, it's worth a listen. Buy it used and save some $.
B000G759LW|4.0|First time I reviewed a disc here. I am a fan of rock , prog rock and jazz fusion. I love seeing bands live so lately I have been strong into the neo - hippie\\"jam\\" genre. I love strong female vocalists and always new Christina was one of the better ones . With this cds nod to early influences her abilities are channeled in the right direction. I saw the video and took a chance that there would be more like it on the disc. Hearing her sing about artists like Coltrane is so appropriate. It is a shame she broke into the scene w/ Brittany Spears and people did not know what to do w/ her. I hope she stays in this direction . I reccommend to anyone and many of my friends find it strange that I listen to this( I tell them to trust me I know what s*cks and this certainly does not) but true music fans already had a copy when I recommended. Variety is the spice of life. Enjoy-I do over and over again.
B000CNDIZE|4.0|This is a much better CD than her \\"healing\\" CD. If you're a Sia fan, this is the one to buy.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I was very please with this product and I recieved it in the time specified. :-)
B000669GAI|4.0|Great tracks.  As a noob to PJ it seems to be a great corss section.<br /><br />There are a lot of tracks on the disk so it's great value for money.<br /><br />I'd prefer it if the sleeve was a proper jewel case and not a cardboard thin sleeve.<br /><br />I was led to believe that PJ would sound like Nirvana, by them both being dubbed \\"grunge\\".  NO WAY!  PJ are so much better than Nirvana.  For a start, they can play the guitar and sing. If you are looking for a Nirvana-like sound, this is probably not for you.  If you want GOOD music, buy this!
B000G8NXYG|5.0|This film only gets better to me with every viewing.  And now, with this great new release from Criterion, I can see it in an even clearer light.  A great transfer accompanied by fantastic extras that give you insight and information on this film that is hard to find elsewhere.  It's like Seven Samurai Film School in a box.  There will never be another release to top this one and probably never another film.  A must have for Kurosawa and film fans.
B00000ICN5|4.0|Like Berry, many of the tracks on this album sound alike.<br /><br />That said, it's classic.
B000E33VWW|5.0|The movie, especially the performance by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, was very good, and prompted me to learn more about Truman Capote.
B000002J09|5.0|A classic, everyone must own it, even those that would not describe themselves as Led Zep fans.<br /><br />Nothing more to be said.  You must own this CD.<br /><br />If you like the hard-rock, riff-driven songs on this CD, I recommend Led Zeppelin II - it contains Zep's best riffs.
0399230033|5.0|We received this book as a gift when my son was born. We've read it every night since birth (about 10 months now) and it still delights my son every time.  <br /> <br />My husband and I love it too. We love the illustrations of the animals and the cute story. A must-read for kids of all ages!
B000G759LW|5.0|This one of the best cd's I've ever heard!  I love the way Christina has taken the \\"40's\\" sound and has blended it with her unique style.  A definite treasure!
B0000C3I6U|5.0|Look, I personally think Arnold Scwarzenegger is awesome and while many people know him from his films which I actually like very much especially his earlier ones where his physical prowess was more played up I actually think he is the most incredible body builder of all time and getting to see a behind the scenes look was great.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|This is one of the best Eastwood movies.  Clint bought and sat on this script for years until he though he was ready and aged enough to play his character William Munny.  The special edition release is well worth the extra price for the upgraded video transfer alone.
0743298020|2.0|After reading all the favorable reviews on this book I was really anxious to read it.  However, I had great difficulty plowing through it.  In no way would I compare this to Jayne Eyre.  I am a librarian,  love to read ,  and had to force myself to finish the book. It was confusing,  vague,  and tedious.  The characters all seemed superficial. I would not recommend it.  I was totally disappointed and found it to be a long read.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I think one of the best series SCI FI, ever had. My only problem, is the movie Serenity, which came first and if the series came first, why did they have to reaquire River.
B00005V1Y0|4.0|This was a gift purchase.  I do know she loves the movie and watches it over and over!!
B00008LOS1|5.0|\\"Who's Next\\" introduced a radical new sound for The Who. Pete Townshend's use of sythesizers and sequencers perfectly compliments the songs included here. We all know this is a classic but why buy this edition vs. the single disc edition. Let me list the reasons;<br /><br />1) This has been remastered using the original mastertapes only the second time that I know of that the original master tapes have been used. Almost all of the previous editions used the safety master (or a copy) of the original album and, as a result, the warmth and detail wasn't quite as rich as on this album. It's not a huge difference but it is noticeable. The best version of this album is still the early version mastered by Steve Hoffman which didn't use much EQ and no Noise Reduction. This version is a very close second best and sounds slightly different due to different EQ choices and the use of No Noise (and other subtle different mastering choices by Astley and Hoffman). I haven't heard the MoFi edition so can't comment on that.<br /><br />2) The bonus tracks are all from the New York Record Plant Session where The Who were trying to lay down tracks for THIS album (and at that point Townshend was still thinking of putting out Lifehouse before associate producer Glyn Johns convinced him that the album would be stronger as a single release since it didn't have a strong narrative story like \\"Tommy\\"). We get early versions of \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\", \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\", \\"Love Ain't For Keeping\\" all of which differ from the finished versions produced in England after these sessions. We also get a different early version of \\"Pure and Easy\\" (which ended up on the far from obscure \\"Odds and Sods\\"), \\"Baby Don't You Do It\\" which runs almost 8 minutes (again a different take from the version on \\"Odds and Sods\\").<br /><br />For the record the single disc edition has seven bonus tracks vs. the six here (\\"Naked Eye\\" which appears also on the single disc edition of this album as a bonus track isn't included here but that's OK as it is on \\"Odds and Sods\\" (which was remastered and re-released after this was remastered with bonus tracks in 1995)but you won't have these if you have the earlier edition of the album without bonus tracks.<br /><br />3) The live concert on the second disc. It's a terrific concert which has floated around as bootlegs but has been beautifully remixed for this edition. It features live performances of 6 tracks included on disc one, material that ultimately appeared on \\"Odds and Sods\\". All sound terrific considering the age of the source tapes (they were recorded on the Rolling Stones mobile unit at The Young Vic theater). This truly is the most important reason outside of the use of the original stereo mastertapes for only the second time in the album's history on CD.<br /><br />4) This is a classic album that deserves to be in every rock fans collection. Sure many of the songs here have been overexposed on FM radio (much as the Stones \\"Let It Bleed\\" and The Beatles \\"Abbey Road\\" albums have been as well) but that doesn't diminish the quality of the songs.<br /><br />The booklet includes amended notes and includes the material from the 1995 booklet but was updated with additional information for the 2003 two disc release.OK as it is on \\"Odds and Sods\\" (which was remastered and re-released after this was remastered with bonus tracks in 1995)but you won't have these if you have the earlier edition of the album without bonus tracks.      3) The live concert on the second disc.

B000006TRV|5.0|No one needs a review of this at this point in life but to me, this was always Floyd's best album.  Everyone can argue darkside and wish or their earlier stuff and that's fine by me.  I personally have always thought this is one of the top 10 albums ever.  For me at least.  I wish they'd release it in SACD or DVD-audio.  I have about 4 versions of it, asian, remastered, etc.
1586210912|4.0|This is the way to read a book...have someone else read for you!  Actually, I am on the road a lot and miss the chance to sit down and be able to devote to the written word.  This was a good story of the  life of a young boy gone right. It's not a get rich quick scheme but the message is simple and it's there for the ambitious and committed.  I recommend this to young and old alike.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Lost is quite possibly the best show on television.  As weird as season one was, things only get wierder for the survivors.  A must see for anyone who loves a good mystery!
0375931007|5.0|When perusing the dust jacket for this book, the narrator is what caught my eye. It's such a unique perspective for story telling that I was compelled to dig deeper. Even the formatting of this book is unique. It jumps around and strays off-topic like an off-the-cuff story teller. But don't be fooled. This book has beautiful, carefully worded imagery that makes it a pleasure to read, despite the grim subject matter. I'd be hard pressed to find a book I've enjoyed more. I'm telling everyone I know to read this book!

B000FFJYCU|4.0|I first saw this movie in Cinerama in 1967, and it was great. After so many years, it was nice to see it again in DVD. Of course the DVD is no match with Cinerama, but still the DVD is excellent. The only flaw I found was that there was no sound in most of the auxiliary material that came with the movie, on how the movie was made. The auxiliary material included interviews with many of the protagonists of the movie, but I heard nothing on what they said. Maybe this was a defect in the DVD that I got.
0140386335|5.0|I've liked this little movie since I first saw it on TV several years ago, several years after it was in the theaters.  I kept catching bits & pieces of the movie so I finally bought it and have enjoyed it each time I watched. <br /> <br />Recently I helped a friend edit his play and it reminded me of the movie, so we watched it together.  It wasn't until then that I realized that it had been based on a book; that's when I decided to order the book and see how well the movie fit with it. <br /> <br />As I read the book, the movie came to life again.  But I was surprised to see there was so much book left after what I thought was the end!  To my extreme pleasure, there were many more adventures and really strange and wild creatures.  Instead of simply having the boy save this \\"imaginary\\" world and ride off on the Luckdragon, we saw his transformation.  What at first seemed like wonderful limitless powers turned out to be his downfall (or could have been).   <br /> <br />Frankly, I think this book should be up there with the Narnia Chronicles in terms of child development, the corruption of power, hope for healing and transformation.  I'm 46 years old and this book touched me in ways I never expected a \\"children's book\\" to do.
B00003CXDD|5.0|This is a wonderful movie to watch with the whole family.  The story line and action can keep even the man of the house interested, but it is not too confusing or frightening for the little ones.  We enjoyed it so much we all watched it three times the first week we had it.
B000I5X81K|5.0|He brings chills to my spine!  I especially loved \\"Machine\\" with Herbie Hancock and \\"Un Giorno Per Noi\\".  Josh gets better every year.  I love when he adds a little boogie.  Although I'm 43 and partial to jazz, Josh warms my bones with his voice.  My mother, who's 64 loves him just as much, so I ordered her a copy as well.
B00006RCNW|4.0|I don't even like cop shows but this show is in a league of its own. Don't let it turn you off just cause it's about cops. It's the second best t.v. series I've ever seen. Only beat out by 24 and that's saying a whole lot. You have to see it.
1932100660|5.0|This is a very good, although dangerous, book.  Be careful because if you read and put it in practice you will find that the whole world is really unside down and that the secret to a healthier life is really at the end of your fork.   <br /> <br />After reading this book I bought several copies to give away to my family and friends.  Highly recommended for everyone interested in their health.

B000H7JCG4|5.0|I was so happy to finally watch 90210 again. AS many of you, I grew up with the series, and it was fun reliving the memories of my childhood with the first season. However, for some reason, each DVD that I played was missing the first episode listed on it. Does anyone else have this problem????
B00004XPPC|5.0|Yanks versus Limeys. This film is about the clash of several cultural ideologies. Ostensibly it's about the conflict between the Anglo-Americans (WWII Allies) and the Japanese (WWII Axis), but there are other, perhaps more significant clashes. Holden represents average American values, Guinness average British values, and the clash between them is just as strong an element in the movie as anything else. Then there's a sort of democracy versus hierarchy class conflict: which is more important, soldierly discipline or free-for-all? There is also a bit of ethnic/racial conflict. Then there's the obvious war versus peaceful co-operation conflict. <br /> <br />One of the reasons Americans may withhold a fifth star, and may feel a little uncomfortable about these themes, and the way they are presented,  is that American values don't really show up too well, nothwithstanding that Colonel Nicholson is also shown as a prize idiot. Shears (Holden) is smart (a favourite American term of praise), and full of wise-cracks; Nicholson (Guinness) is dumb (a favourite American put-down), and doesn't appreciate jokes. But the question remains: is it better to build a bridge than to blow it up? There's only one answer to that.  <br /> <br />The British preferred method in the game of life used to be to try to play it straight and take the consequences. The American method is to duck and dodge, make time as much as possible, and, if that doesn't work, to shoot first and ask questions later. It may be practical, but it doesn't win too many friends in the long run. It may not even be practical: it hasn't worked too well so far in any of the global hot-spots since the end of WWII.  There is in existence a psychological analysis of the behaviour of war prisoners of the Chinese, in Korea, broken down by nationality. Not too many Americans know about it, and if they did, they wouldn't like it.  <br /> <br />This is, of course, an utterly brilliant film, full of ambiguities and conundrums. A marvellous script, fantastic cinematography, superb performances. Some of the reviewers here come up with remarks which are enough to make one weep. \\"Jack Hawkins was a prisoner\\". Huh? \\"Slow and corny\\", and so on. Well, Rome wasn't built in a day. There were wooden bridges in Britain which lasted for 600 years. America has only about another 400 years to go. I'm not pitching for the American vote in this review.  I'm too dumb.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I love Lost. I can't get enough of it. This is such a complex show you need the DVD even if you never missed an episode. I saw seasons 1 and 2. Then I watched the DVD collection and there are things that happened in episodes that you didn't realize until you watch it again. It's a must have.
B000GG4KTU|5.0|Krall is back to doing what she does best - standards. <br />The band is wonderful and the arrangements are imaginative. <br />
B000IU3XU6|4.0|3 years has it been? I fell in &hearts; with the music of Josh Groban when I first heard him on PBS. I was like 12 or something and he's been my favorite singer since that very day. I've been waiting for this new album for 3 yrs. and it's finally here!!! His voice is unlike anything I've ever heard before and this album is as great as the last two. My favortie song is \\"You are loved\\". I agree with everyone else, Josh needs to put out a Christmas album sometime.
B0007XT7V8|5.0|I bought this for Santa Monica and it has become my favorite cd ever...
B000GIWS7E|5.0|For all true Dream Theater fans, this is a must have DVD! The only drawback to \\"Score\\" that I found was that they didn't play \\"Never Enough\\", but that shouldn't prevent you from purchasing \\"Score\\". I have watched the DVD over 10 times already and it hasn't gotten old for me...
B000HT3Q3M|5.0|I can't get enough of this CD!  George Benson & Al Jarreau have paired to created a truly exceptional collection of music which is destined to become a classic.  George's smooth guitar style blends wonderfully with Al's vocals.  The duets are so nice to listen to & my favorites are Summer Breeze, Four & the funky Don't Start No Schtuff. The guest performers are also great; check out Jill Scott on God Bless The Child.  George is a wonderful vocalist in his own right & his rendition of All I Am is especially beautiful. <br />It is so refreshing to see a record company allow established artists like George & Al to produce truly great music!   <br />Don't miss this one!!
B000FIMG68|5.0|great service, great price, and excellent shipping time. highly recommend
B00005JKJA|5.0|This is yet one more brilliant film in the Lynch universe.  I've loved everything he's done (even Twin Peaks: Firewalk With Me), and he seems to get better with each film.  This film was originally a TV pilot (!), but it was rejected by ABC as \\"too weird\\".  That really isn't too surprising.  So David got additional funds, and made into one of his best films.  I don't want to hear any explanations of what actually occured in the film.  All I know is that it did occur, and I felt it, whatever it was.  That's good enough for me and the rest of the world.  Even Roger Ebert liked this film, even though I think it was because the majority of critics adored it, and Ebert didn't want to be in constrast to the crowd (Ebert has always been hostile to Lynch's work).  The performances are superb all around, with kudos going to Justin Theroux as \\"the director\\", who has a great scene with studio heads about \\"the girl\\".  Love the golf club!  Lovely.
B000G759LW|5.0|I've never been a real big Christina fan.  I remember her from the Mickey Mouse Club.  She's always been a great vocalist.  I've thought her music was a little bubble gum to me.  She kind of caught my attention with her Stripped album.  I thought two of the hits from the album were pretty good.  But now...  I must say that I have enjoyed this entire album!!  She's all grown up.  If you like Christina, you won't be disappointed.  If you're not a fan, I recommend you give her another chance.   I really liked her swing style on some of the songs.  Again, A+ for this album.  Hey, I might even go see her in concert now.  :-)
B00006CXGM|4.0|This movie is a perfect example of the quality movies Brad Pitt was involved in during the late 90s/early 00s.  The humor is fantastic and the characters are perfect.
B00004U2GH|5.0|San Quentin was his 2nd prison album. It's another great album with some of his best songs. The new songs that were added are also top notch. Not for the kids though some profanity. The gospel songs are terrific. The interviews on the insert give it quite the context.
B000005RNQ|4.0|I'm partial to Saxon's third album \\"Strong Arm Of The Law\\".  It has a pace and energy that highlighted the early part of this great band's career.  A followup would be somewhat difficult, as it is any time a band creates a definitive work, but \\"Denim & Leather\\" isn't bad at all.<br /><br />  The opening track \\"Princess Of The Night\\" is a Saxon staple.  No, it isn't about hookers.  Rather, the \\"Princess\\" is a fond look back at a famed steam locomotive.  Biff Byford has always been able to write crowd pleaser lyrics, like \\"Play It Loud\\", with its distinctive AC/DC riff and the title track, but he also excels in more cerebral topics that helped give Saxon a unique place in classic metal.  For my money, any rock and roll song about trains is a winner.<br /><br />  The production could stand remastering, with more guitars up front, but since Saxon is not a world wide legend like Iron Maiden or Judas Priest, although they should be, such projects are probably too expensive.<br /><br />  Nonetheless, classic metal heads can't go wrong with this album.  Get \\"Wheels Of Steel/Strong Arm of the Law\\" on the double CD, too, while you're at it.
B000028U0Y|5.0|This is vintage Johnny Cash. You can listen to him draw the tough crowd into his concert. Not for the young kids though, some profanity and honky tonk type songs. If you love Johnny cash, you'll love this album.
0739326740|5.0|Hi,<br /><br />Da Vinci Code is the book anyone consider themself to be genious. Lovers of Art, Architecture, Sclpture, Mathamatics, Fabonaci Sequence, History will love this book. Any one who loves thriller, suspence will also love this book. I guarantee, anyone starting this book will glue to it till it is over.<br /><br />Hasit.
B000I5X81A|5.0|I'm a long time Clapton lover all the way back to when CREAM ruled my head. If you like the Clapton Chronicles or any of the later works where the engineering is top shelf, you will love this album. The collaboration of Cale and Clapton is sensual and fluid. John Mayer is clearly a Clapton student and the late Preston is part of the glue. All the artists on this album shine with talent and humility. This one's a real keeper for me. I love it.
B00000JNJ1|5.0|The Best of Faces is a truly awesome album. I have always been a Rod Stewart fan and Faces is the best personification of the music that made him so great. It is too bad I was born to late because I would have loved to have seen them live; jugding by their studio work, their shows must have been awesome!! Stewart's vocals were the best; I'm not much for the tracks where Ronnie Lane was singing didn't do anything for me. I highly recommend this album to anyone though. Their music is just really good and a lot of fun to listen to.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|What else could a pair of Jared and Jensen fans with a love for mistery want?
0425200450|5.0|Fourteen passengers and Hercule Poirot on a train, stuck in a blizzard in a mountain pass on the way from Cairo to Calais.  Breathes there a crime fiction fan with soul so dead that she isn't familiar with this story?  Still, they call them \\"classics\\" for a reason, and Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express was one on publication in 1934.  It was at that time an entirely new take on the locked room mystery, and the little gray cells of the Belgian detective with the magnificent moustaches are put seriously to the test.<br /><br /> Must reading for any fan of the genre, and made into an iconic film in 1974 starring a host of instantly recognizable faces, including Albert Finney, Lauren Bacall, Sean Connery, and Ingrid Bergman, who won an Oscar for her performance.  The best adaptation of a Christie novel and I checked:  It's out on DVD.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's been quite some time since I've enjoyed a series as much as I did Firefly.  My only complaint is that there's no second season.  Great entertainment!
B000FIMG68|5.0|Season 2 of Lost is no doubt better than Season 1. From the introduction of the \\"tailies\\" to the relentless pace of some episodes, it satisfies the need for answers and for even more mysteries. We see more of The Others than we've seen in Season 1 and get a glimpse of their motives (or maybe not!). <br /> <br />Great new characters are introduced, including one who has become my favorite lostie, along with Hurley. The interaction between the tailies and the original lost cast is fantastic. Great chemistry there! <br /> <br />Definitely worth the price Amazon is charging for this set. Buy it with confidence. And don't watch it until you've watched the entire first season. <br /> <br />Enjoy!
B000002O4X|1.0|I absolutely love the music from Out of Africa, but I do not recommend this CD at all. The sound quality is so poor that I could only bear listening to it once.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|I was very impressed with Bob Dylan's Modern Times CD.  My 90-year old mother bought a copy as well and wants his recordings to be played at her funeral services!  Needless to say, we both enjoy this album and play it everyday. One of his best.
B000GW8RX4|4.0|wawou  ronnie james dio   cozy powell    ritchie blackmore          that is a famous group     so this dvd is not    a very exemple of  sound of image  but  what a show         ronnie dio sing so well        so i recommend this to all fans of  rainbow        and i wait for another concert in dvd of rainbow
B000G8NY4U|5.0|This live concert/performance by Yanni is awesome! He incorporates  several rhythms from throughout the world and converts them into a master piece. I highly recommend this DVD....
B00005TT77|5.0|Beatle's lyrics combined with today's musical talent.  A great combination!  If you love the Beatles, you'll love this CD.  I keep ordering \\"one more\\", it's taking care of a lot of people on my holiday gift giving list!
0345440900|4.0|I bought this book along with several others to decide which methods I agree with. I thought her flexible schedule and non-cruel bedtime routine were pretty middle-of-the-road and helpful, and they have really helped me and my 3 month old to get in a good rhythm. He can now go to sleep on his own and I didn't have to endure hours of crying to get there. Her tips on how to read your baby's cues, respond to needs, and break bad habits were helpful as well. However, I completely dissagree with her refusal to admit that breastfeeding IS proven to be best for baby, even if not possible for everyone. Once you get past that small flaw (and only a tiny part of the book), it is a book that does just what it claims-- helps you calm, connect, and communicate with your baby.
B000089RVX|5.0|Just starting to listen to Evanescence's music and this CD was an excellent choice.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|If you saw it in theaters and liked it then you like this dvd as well.  The special features are awesome.
0385040253|5.0|This book has about every known knot in it.  His illustrations are much better than photos and his instructions are clear. <br /> <br />It belongs within easy reach.
B0007XT7V8|5.0|Theory of a Deadman is one of those bands that I hope never gets HUGE!  I want them all to myself.  Gasoline has songs full of the emotions that we have all felt too often, but never had the balls to show.  Thank you to Tyler and the boys for saying the things that we want to, but don't.  This CD Rocks!!!!!!!!
B000GFLAI0|5.0|I'm a huge Bob Dylan fan.  I often wish though he'd move on, where I don't know, but somewhere else.  Write something similar in style--NOT CONTENT--to when he first started his career.  I hear what he writes now,like it, but realize to myself--this could be a lot fuller, richer, angrier, in love, sad, upset, and so on.    **Orginally I rated this album 5 stars but upon listening to it over and over...it bores me (I know give it 2.5).  I would have to say if you want Dylan go for \\"Bringing it all back home\\", \\"Highway 61\\", \\"Blood on the Tracks\\", \\"Freewheelin'\\" (if you like soft political acoustic), \\"Time they are a changin'\\", even \\"Desire\\", but don't get this album.  There's maybe two good songs on here and even they get boring.
B000002U8G|5.0|First off, this is a great album. Starting off the album is \\"One of These Days,\\" an instrumental piece mainly showing off drummer Nick Mason's skills, but also featuring a catchy bass riff by Roger Waters, and David Gilmour's finger sliding on guitar. Next is \\"A Pillow Of Winds,\\" personally one of my favorite Pink Floyd song's ever. It's a very soft song that features mostly pastoral lyrics. Next is \\"Fearless,\\" a sort of southern rock, non-Pink Floyd sounding song, but highly listenable. Then there is San Tropez, and Seamus. Easily my least favorite off the album. These two songs are something you probably wouldn't expect from Pink Floyd. Then finally there is \\"Echoes,\\" the 20 minute piece that gives you a taste of what the new Pink Floyd would bring. This song has wonderful lyrics and music. All together a great album and collector's piece for any Pink Floyd fan.
6305558167|4.0|I found this version to be an entertaining story of Merlin, the Magician, King Arthur, Camelot - and of course the Magic of The Sword.
B000002U9W|5.0|The album starts of with \\"Atom Heart Mother (Suite),\\" which is a 20 minute instrumental piece featuring an orchesta. Although very long, this piece in my opinion is highly listenable. Next is \\"If,\\" a very soft piece consisting of only a guitar and the voice of Roger Waters. Next is \\"Summer '68\\" this would have to be my least favorite song on the album. It features Richard Wright. Next is \\"Fat Old Sun,\\" a very soft piece written and performed by David Gilmour. Finally there is \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast,\\" a piece featuring all of the band and the sounds of then roadie \\"Alan Parsons\\" talking about breakfast and various breakfast sounds, including popping grease, and cereal being made. This is one of my favorite instrumental pieces by the band. It is very soft but at the same time very energetic. I give the album 5 stars.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|This is a must buy for all fans of Bob Dylan and for those who have been out of touch with Dylan's latest works. It has been 5 years since Bob Dylan released his last work \\"Love and Theft\\" and if you liked that one you're in for a real treat with this one. This CD shot straight up the charts the day after it's release.
B000002UA5|5.0|I'm not going to write a long review, because there are already many helpful ones below. I just want my opinion heard. The album's main disc \\"Ummagumma,\\" features mostly instrumental tracks that are very psychedelic and some people may not like them. Personally I do, but this was a stage in which Pink Floyd were expierimenting with sound. The second disc, features live performances of the band, with a great selection in songs. I give the album 5 stars.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|John Mayer's third main album after 'Room for Squares' and 'New Deep'is little less than another masterpiece.  <br />There are people who do not like his songs or his voice, but nobody can deny that Mayer is a huge talent. <br />With his knack for inventive electric blues guitar (the JM trio album 'Try! was the ultimate proof), the yet again seemingly simple songs with clever lyrics on this album are very well procuced, making every note on 'Continuum' worth listening to. So the songs can creep up in your mind for later enjoyment. Johm Mayer is music at is best. As an instrumentalist, a singer/songwriter and producer this album is quite an archievement. If the music sounds a little obvious here and there, rest assured that the simplicity of a musical master is always good for anybody to listen to. Buy this album, and buy the others too!!
B0000DBJDM|5.0|The people who are complaining about \\"No audience,\\" and the \\"Director's Cut,\\" being a con, obviously aren't too big on Pink Floyd. The Director's Cut in my opinion is better than the original. It includes all the music from the original plus additional \\"Dark Side Of The Moon,\\" footage. I think they chose great songs too. They only had 5 days to shoot the film and 2 days were taken up by technical difficulties. So for the 3 days they had to shoot the film, I think Adrian Mabien did a terrific job. 5 Stars for me.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|Maiden had fallen in a kind of confort state, when Dance of Death came and we saw the same maiden but a little bit less daring... but now, they just show the world that they still rock... and above this, that they are willing to experiment... and what an experiment. <br /> <br />There is no bad songs in this one... and they all will rock your head in a new Maiden kind of way!
B000002U9Y|5.0|\\"A Saucerful Of Secrets,\\" is an excellent album. Although alot of the songs on the album feature long psychedelic instrumental pieces, they are highly listenable. I give this album 5 stars.
B000E6EJAC|5.0|Bowie loved this band. And when their lack of success almost broke them up, He came in and produced this album for them. This 1972 masterpiece put them up there with the likes of T.Rex and Ziggy Stardust as the bearers of a musical movement loosely called Glam Rock. Imagine a glamed out Rolling Stones. They were not goofy like Slade or artsy like Roxy Music or Bowie. They were just right. Like the New York Dolls, they had a trashy attitude. Unlike the Dolls, they knew how to play their instruments. The bonus material is great. The demo version of \\"One of the Boys\\" is out of sight.
B0002XEDQM|2.0|The songs are poor, the recording quality is worse. For some reason no one can duplicate the sacd multichannel quality in Dire Straits or Allison Krause.
0684859106|4.0|As we all know that The Magnolia Bakery is well-known for their scrumpcious baked goods. Well after perusing this book, the Magnolia Bakery has come to my kitchen. I have so many requests from friends, colleagues, and family members asking me to \\"make them that dessert that I made them\\" over and over again. Just can't get enough.
0060229357|5.0|This book is so great for exploring what one little boy can imagine in one night with one purple crayon.  Our daughter has tried to duplicate the drawings with chalk in the driveway.  A true classic!
B000H7I6CU|1.0|My rage isn't against the movie, because it's excellent. Just read all the other reviews posted here.<br /><br />My anger is against the reason behind this DVD's marketing strategy. Why in this world this thieves at Disney didn't include an English and Spanish audio tracks in the same DVD, or at least included Spanish subtitles along with the English track. They didn't do it because they wanted to squeeze more money out from their loyal customers, and force them to buy two copies of the same movie, one in English and one in Spanish.<br /><br />I never go to the movies at the theater because mi wife doesn't understand English. I usually wait for the DVD release and buy it for the enjoyment of the movie at my home, playing it in my already expensive home theater system. Thus, if a movie doesn't have Spanish (audio or subtitles) I simply don't buy it. But I had to buy this one because my kids.<br /><br />My kids and I do speak English and we watch the DVD with English audio, given my kids prefer it that way. But when I watch the movie together with my wife we do it with Spanish audio or at least with Spanish subtitles (yes, I commonly watch movies twice). This time, with Cars' DVD, my wife was left out the enjoyment, of course, unless I buy the Spanish version.<br /><br />I've bought every DVD Disney has produced and sold in the past 5 years, but a rip off like this makes me think in piracy as an option.... Did you hear that Disney?
B000GFLAI0|5.0|I love this album. I have been a fan since the 1960's.  He is still as good as ever.
0780626494|5.0|I first saw, \\"Blast from the past\\" at a friends house on a premium channel.  I liked it so much that I ordered the DVD so I could watch it again. <br />It's a little far fetched to be realistic, but hey, it's a movie.   <br />I thought it was funny and clever.  The type of movie I will watch several more times, at least.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|This release by Dave Grohl and Co. show once again that they are ready to rock and rock hard!
B0001L3LUE|5.0|One of the \\"lessons\\" that Robert McNamara imparts in this documentary is that \\"in order to do good, you may have to engage in evil.\\"  This lesson essentially sums up the life of not only McNamara but the history of the United States in the later half of the 20th century.  However, the question that the film really presents is just how much evil must one do to accomplish good.  In the final estimation, did McNamara do more good then evil?  Morris does not answer this, but makes it clear that this ultimate question cannot be answered by simply plugging in numbers to an IBM machine.  One could be tempted to think that for every Japanese life lost in the fire bombings in 1945, maybe 10 American lives were sparred from a land invasion of the home islands.  Was that worth it?  For the 68,000 lives lost in Vietnam, did McNamara make this up in his leadership of the World Bank?  There is not an answer to this question, and even the subject of this documentary cannot attempt to answer it without contradicting himself.  At one point in the interview McNamara believes that he was acting as part of a machine, but later on adds that he was acting as a war criminal during the bombing of Japan.  Does mankind abdicate his free will when the fog of war rolls in?  This is what makes this documentary so compelling is that it shows a 83 year old coming to grips with the reality of what he has done, and what he has not done.<br /><br />One could think that a viewer would have come away from this documentary with an understandable loathing for Robert McNamara.  After all, he would be the prototypical target of such protest songs as Dylan's \\"Masters of War\\" or the poster-child of the military-industrial complex.  Yet, each time I watch the movie, I do not feel anger towards him, but I feel rather a partial remoteness that is hard to explain.  Part of the explanation is that if placed in the same situation, I know that I would have acted the same way.  I too would have followed orders from Curtis LeMay concerning the bombing of Japan.  I also would have probably ran Vietnam with the same attitude that McNamara did.  Now that we have seen that the lessons from Vietnam were not read when it came to Iraq, one could only think of what George Bernard Shaw once wrote:\\"We learn from history that we learn nothing from history.\\"  \\"The Fog of War\\" is not a dry historical documentary, but rather a primer on philosophy, rationality and ultimately death.from Curtis LeMay concerning the bombing of Japan.  I also would have probably ran Vietnam with the same attitude that McNamara did.  Now that we have seen that the lessons from Vietnam were not read when it came to Iraq, one could only think of what George Bernard Shaw once wrote:\\"We learn from history that we learn nothing from history.\\"   \\"The Fog of War\\" is not a dry historical documentary, but rather a primer on philosophy, rationality and ultimately death.   <br />
B000GFLAI0|5.0|After all those years with no new albums, Bob Dylan is sounding better than ever.  Nobody puts a song across like Dylan. We love this album!  It's so good, we're already humming his new tunes and we've decided to go hear him sing them in person.  Can't wait!
B000000OQF|5.0|One of the most iconic rock albums you'll ever come across!! I dont know what took me so long to buy it but now that I did, well, its hard not to listen to it. Truely one of rocks favorite.
B00005JLWN|4.0|This movie is great.  If you like sci-fi flicks that present an alternative reality or a glimpse of a possible future such as The Matrix or Soylent Green, you will like this.  Individual tastes are different I am aware, but give this one a chance.  It moves a bit slowly at times, and you may find yourself wanting for more action, but it is presented so well from cinematic and story-building standpoint that it is worth watching.
006097625X|5.0|Scott Mcloud is a thorough writer. He builds his arguments to a point. I was thrilled to have a serious book about comics, that utilises the medium. <br />This book is intelligent and insightful. If you're a comic lover or artist (not just comics, but all forms of art), you'll have a lot to learn from this book.
B000683VI4|5.0|This is one of the better movies I've seen in quite awhile.  It is a love story, but not your typical love story.  The love story is in fact framed inside the paradigm of a woman who is suffering from Alzheimers.<br /><br />The biggest selling point of the cast is Ms. Rachel McAdams.  I saw her in WEDDING CRASHERS and I've been anxious to see more of her work.  She is gorgeous AND she pulls of a fabulous performance in this movie.  I predict her as one of Hollywood's up & coming stars (at least I hope so!).<br /><br />For a guy whose father suffers from Alzheimers, this movie really hit home.  An interesting facet of the film is that it covers the period of when the characters are very young (their courtship) and the period of their Golden Years.<br /><br />This is a must-see movie, even for people who don't normally care for \\"mushy\\" movies.  In a single word, this story is unforgettable.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Excellent analogy for what is going on in today's world. Should people give up some freedoms for \\"security\\" from their government? Whether leaders intentionally take away freedoms in order to enhance their own power or feel they are helping their people by keeping them in a constant state of fear of terrorists, we should question every aspect of it. Watch this movie if you aren't sure which side you are on. Oh... there are a lot of knives flying and fake blood.  :)
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Here is a stunningly elegant movie that is sure to grasp your attention.  The \\"hero\\" is a dark vigilante type character who has been victimized by \\"the system.\\"  He is out for revenge, and the powers-that-be in the upper echelons of government had better take heed!<br /><br />Natalie Portman is gorgeous.  Heck, she even looks great bald.  She also has a lot of potential as an actress.  She is perfect as the dark hero's side-kick.  Hugo Weaving is terrific as the vigilante.  He shows off the distinctive voice that we were introduced to in THE MATRIX series.<br /><br />On some level, this movie seems to be a subtle attack at the Bush administration and all of the steps it has taken to absorb more power and subtract any sort of congressional oversight.  Cutting away civil liberties in hopes of gaining more security is almost never a good idea. The totalitarian paradigm of \\"the ends justify the means of extreme government\\" is as alive and well today it has always been.  Just a thought.....<br /><br />In any case, this is a thrilling (albeit dark)  movie that is sure to be a worthwhile addition to your DVD collection.  When the leader of a country becomes the \\"bad guy\\" we're all in peril.  That is one lesson that will forever remain unchanging.

B000GFLAI0|4.0|While Modern Times isn't as darkly introspective as Time Out of Mind or as energetic and gritty as \\"Love and Theft,\\" there is a sort of relaxed charm to the album as a whole. Here Dylan's band takes a laid-back approach sanding off any sharp edges with brushed drums and a looser arrangement that speaks of a live performance in some hole-in-the-wall tavern. For the most part, the songs themselves aren't as striking as those found on Dylan's last album, perhaps because his sound here is more of a modification of that found on \\"Love and Theft\\" and not an outright evolution. <br /> <br />As on \\"Love and Theft\\" there are essentially three kinds of songs on Modern Times: 1) The rollicking blues-rock of \\"Thunder on the Mountain,\\" \\"Rollin' and Tumblin',\\" \\"Someday Baby,\\" and \\"The Levee's Gonna Break\\"; 2) The burlesque crooning of \\"Spirit On The Water,\\" \\"When The Deal Goes Down,\\" and \\"Beyond The Horizon\\"; and 3) The atmospheric gloom of \\"Nettie Moore\\" and \\"Ain't Talkin.\\" While they all hit the mark in their own way, with repeated listenings I find myself drawn more and more to that last category. \\"Nettie Moore\\" is so sparse and straight-forward that it lingers long after the song has ended and \\"Ain't Talkin\\" has the same chilling power as \\"Sugar Baby,\\" the last track from Modern Times. <br /> <br />Only \\"Workingman's Blues #2\\" struck me as something that didn't readily fit into any of these styles. It's an unusual song, perhaps, because it almost seems like a protest song for, pardon the pun, modern times. It's a song about the everyman trying to survive in a world that is constantly outpacing him: \\"You can hang back or fight your best on the frontline/ Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues...\\" <br /> <br />While I don't think Modern Times quite lives up to it's predecessor, it's still a fine, solid album that benefits from repeated listenings. Dylan seems to have found his groove and instead of drastically changing his sound (as he is often wont to do), he's decidedto stick with what works, tweaking it as he sees fit. Indeed, it's reminiscent of the changes that took place between Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde On Blonde, the differences being more subtle and atmospheric.  <br /> <br />Let's hope that whatever Dylan does in the future, he continues the success he's found on his last three albums.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|I was typically frightened how this movie would be or turn out, if would be good or bad.  After finally watching it I would rank this as one of the best movies out of my collection.  The only thing that rumbles in my head about this movie is how similar our society reflects the ongoing propaganda to that in the movie. This movie can almost be something most people would cringe at, cause at one instance we could be living the movie!?!?!    People should not fear their government's, government's should fear their people!!!!!!!!!!!!!

0800141660|5.0|This is a very soothing film, something like comfort food.  It is very romantic, but it contains a realism that is applicable to modern era. One idea that captured me was the way engaged couples were treated in Austin's society.  Formality and polite manners were always expected of people in higher social positions.  However, the genuine respect certain characters  displayed toward others went beyond politeness.  It was a refreshing difference.

0345479092|4.0|I've been very helped by this book -- love the emphasis on respecting your baby and learning how to interpret her cries, sounds and other cues. Hogg recommends a consistent routine of Eat, Activity, Sleep, You (your time to rest or get things done) and has chapters giving helpful advice and tips for each phase of the cycle (although I disagreed with much of her thoughts on breast feeding versus formula). My baby has thrived on having a routine, and I've been helped by knowing where we are in the cycle. Her \\"flexible routine\\" doesn't take all the guesswork out of parenting, but it makes caring for baby a lot less stressful. Her discussion of different baby types are helpful too. Some friends who have a baby who cries a lot were encouraged by the idea that their baby was \\"Spirited\\" (one of Hogg's categories) versus \\"colicky\\" or \\"finnicky\\" or \\"difficult.\\" Definitely worth the purchase price.
B000H7JCG4|2.0|BOOOOOO!!!!  Most likely because of music rights issues, the discs do NOT contain the originally broadcast songs in it.  You can imagine my dissapointment upon hearing Brenda debating shoplifting a silk vest to a scratch music track (generic) rather than to Soho's \\"Hippie Chick\\" as I remember it. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, I didnt read the back cover of the disc set thoroughly prior to ripping off the plastic wrap otherwise this DVD set would have been returned.
0596007124|5.0|I first got into design patterns when I heard about the Singleton pattern from a senior developer at my last job.  (To all Singleton naysayers: I know it has its weaknesses, the Singleton pattern has its place!)  This book is a gem!!! It makes learning the patterns fun.  And they are a nearly a cure all for those moments when you have a project and you don't know where to start.  On a side note, you don't need to know Java to get into this book.  If you know C++ or C# you should be able to follow the concepts, which is all that really matters!

If you are a fan of pedestrian writing, lack-luster plots and hackneyed character development, this is your book.
B000IJ79WU|3.0|attended last week's world premiere screening of the much anticipated Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut. Like many Supe fans, I'd been looking forward to this for a LONG time. However, I'm here to tell you to lower your expectations on this one. It's simply not as good as the released version finished by Richard Lester. <br /> <br />After seeing the Donner version, I watched the Lester version again to make sure I could coherently compare the two versions. I concluded there are several very serious problems with the Donner version, and I'll lay these out, alerting you to spoilers. <br /> <br />First, a few comments about the original Superman 1, so you understand where I'm coming from. IMO, the first film had several major tone shifts. The Krypton section was very serious, bordering on pretentious. Brando played Jor-El not like a man, but as a demi-god, cold, aloof and superior. The Smallville section (my favorite portion) evoked Frank Capra-John Ford Americana, human and emotional. And the Metropolis section started as an enjoyable comic book, but then degenerated into goofy camp as Lex Luthor's ridiculous plan unfolded, and Gene Hackman mugged and played Superman's arch-enemy for laughs. For me, the Luthor characterization and earthquake plot ruined what I thought what could have been a fine film. And I totally didn't buy Superman turning back time, which I thought was a complete cop-out. All real Superman fans know that Supes can't do that (and even if he could, he wouldn't)! So that's the \\"baggage\\" I bring to this review. <br /> <br />On to Superman II. As most fans of the series know, Brando filmed scenes for the Fortress of Solitude sequences, but they were dropped when he demanded more money, and redone with Susannah York as Lara. Donner's version restores the Brando scenes. I found these restored scenes too long and not very good. The truth is, Brando did these films for the money, and basically walked through his role. I doubt that there is any survey ofBrando's work that mentions Jor-El as one of his memorable performances. It seemed that Donner wanted to include every frame of Brando, so there's a lot of repetition. For example, Superman II now opens as Part 1 did, with Jor-El sentencing the 3 villains to the Phantom Zone, reciting the litany of their crimes. When Luthor plays back the recording crystals in the Fortress of Solitude, he gets the exact same explanation by Jor-El, about the villains. Hearing this information twice is boring and unnecessary. Later, Jor-El interacts with his son. But the tonal shifts of the first film come back to undermine the second one. Brando's pompous interpretation of Jor-El simply doesn't mesh well with Reeve's everyman version of Supes. These actors are in two different movies. Lester got around this by using Lara instead, in a performance that we can now see had more humanity than Brando's, but was light enough to maintain the comic book tone. Lara is sympathetic and basically supportive regarding her son's conflict about love vs duty, and this serves the story well, providing the emotion the story needs at this point.  <br /> <br />SPOILER. In Donner's version, Jor-El is judgmental and dismissive to his son which, although is true to his characterization, does not make Superman's ultimate decision to give up his powers believable. But Donner's worst choice is in the placement of this scene. In Lester's version, Superman talks to his mom about his conflict, then gives up his powers BEFORE he sleeps with Lois. The implication is that Superman can't have sex with a human unless he surrenders his super powers (no doubt, his super orgasm, going faster than a speeding bullet, would be fatal!). But Donner has the sex scene first, and then has Superman talk to Jor-El and give up his powers.  <br /> <br />This begs the question, if Superman can have sex with a human, why give up his powers? It makes no sense! Changing the order of these scenes completely undermines the human story and conflict at the core of the film. Later, when Clark returns to the Arctic in hopes of restoring his powers, there's yet another scene with Jor-El, who says \\"I knew this was going to happen,\\" followed by some ridiculous mumbo jumbo in which Jor-El somehow transfers his spirit into his son to restore his powers. It's supposed to be moving and emotional, but it's not because there's no human relationship between Jor-El and Kal-El to begin with. Richard Lester simply showed us Clark finding the green power crystal and left the rest to our imagination, keeping the tone of the entire film light, like a comic book. Donner, however, adds in elements of pretension, and even said in the panel discussion afterward that he was trying to make a movie about the father-son relationship. But it doesn't work, and it doesn't belong because Superman II isn't a movie about father and son, it's about a man who has to decide between what he wants for himself and his responsibility to the world.  <br /> <br />Almost every scene in Donner's version goes on too long. There's usually an extra unnecessary beat at the end of scenes. There's more Luthor and Otis, more Luthor and Miss Teschmacher, more Luthor with the villains, all which slow down the pace for the sake of marginal gags. If you like Hackman's Luthor, you may enjoy this. But I didn't. <br /> <br />There is a nice alternate version of the scene in which Lois throws herself into the river in an attempt to prove Clark is Superman. Donner's version takes place at the Daily Planet, where Lois jumps out the window - same gimmick, different execution. And the screen tests on the Superman 1 DVD are turned into the revelation scene at Niagara Falls, which works pretty well. <br /> <br />SPOILER. Finally, we have a major cop-out with the ending. After the villains have been vanquished and we're back at the Daily Planet, Lois tells Clark that his secret is safe with her. But rather than giving Lois the \\"magic kiss of forgetfulness\\" to erase her memory, Superman once again turns back time, using the same footage from Part 1. He turns back time so far that the villains end up back in the Phantom Zone, meaning that the entire movie never happened! This is followed by the final denouement from the released version, in which Clark Kent returns to the diner and takes down the bully who beat him up. However, because time has been turned back, Clark had never been here before, so this makes no sense either! There's also another serious lapse of logic regarding the time reversal which requires too much explanation, but it will be obvious to most viewers.  <br /> <br />Most of the music is recycled from the first film. This didn't bother me, but someone else who was there said that the cues kept reminding him of the scenes from Part 1 in which they originally occurred.  <br /> <br />All in all, the Donner Version is an interesting curiosity, with some good moments among a lot of misfires. But personally, I'm glad we have the Richard Lester version, which is more coherent tonally, makes more sense, and is more entertaining. Superman completists will no doubt want this DVD for the collection. For everyone else, I suggest you rent it before you buy it.

B00005JPAM|3.0|Nothing could be me fitting to see a movie about British politics on the U.S.A. election day in the rain.  The title of this movie was deceptive as it concentrated almost exclusively on the week after Daian was killed in the car crash in Paris.  When I bought the ticket, I said \\"I have come to see the Queen.\\"    We met her (played superbly by Helen Mirren) on Tony Blair's first day in office.  After being elected as Prime Minister of Britain, he is shown down on his knee asking Queen Elizabeth's permission to be \\"her\\" Prime Minister.  It was a factitious meeting to say the least.    The actor who portrasyed Blair was cute (showed a lot of teeth) and matured as the events occurred and he had to speak to the world on the family's behalf.  He was marvelous.  Diana died August 30, 1997, a lovely but deluded young woman who'd been ostracized by the royal family.  The monarchy watched t.v. like the rest of the world as they stayed in seclusion out in the country.  The Queen had deemed it a private Spenser family funeral, even though Charles had to remind her  of their responsibility, that Diana had been the loving mother of the future King of England.    As the Queen finally came to terms that she must make an appearance by September 4th, as worldwide disapproval was increasing, she shed a few tears (as I did when my ex mother-in-law died) and a beautiful stag appeared as a prominition.  It showed her humanity, though the whole family were old fashioned and set in their ways:  harsh, uncaring, in denial, thinking only of themselves instead of the two sons of Diana.    Blair carried on in a remarkably mature manner which won him many American admirers; almost ten years since those happenings, and he will retire in 2007.  He is almost as great now as Winston Churchill, even with his pajama top on which BLAIR was on the back.  He had a supportive wife and called Diana \\"the people's princess.\\"  Plans were changed from private to a public funeral despite the Queen's cold attitute.      It was very moving to see her looking at the mountain of flowers outside the gates of Balmoral Castle and to have her stand, \\"the flag,\\" at half staff.  It was a minute-by-minute, day by day account of that terrible tragedy and repercussions in September, 1997.  We will always remember the televised coverage just as we watched the beautiful wedding some years prior, which led up to this miserable day, and the funeral proceedings of JFK in 1962.    Some things are so remarkable that you can't get them erased from your memory, and the pain is always there.  I wasn't expecting this when I went to the movie, as I avoid painful memories in my subconscious as much as I can.  I could not see the 9-11 movie, but sometimes after we re-live emotional, painful situations there is a cleansing which is theraputic -- and this movie fits the bill in that aspect.  Go see it, or buy the video.  It is a good, though different, interpretation of how Diana was finally made a \\"Queen\\" in spirit.  Long Live The Queen in Heaven and on earth.

B000FIMG68|5.0|No kidding:  LOST may well be the best (and most consistently gripping) show on television, ever.  Without doubt, season 2 is no let-down:  from the first episode to the last, it lives up to season 1 in fine style.<br /><br />If you've not yet visited the castaways on their mysterious Island, you should.  The scenery is lush and spectacular, the story constantly evolves, the characters are rich and fully-fleshed, the performances are uniformly excellent, and the story-telling is consistently top-notch.<br /><br />It seems ABC has learned the lesson of Twin Peaks, but only time will tell....

When I first heard about this CD's release, I couldn't wait to hear it, being a fan of both Emmy Lou & Mark Knopfler.  Two truly great artists on their own. This CD went way beyond all my wildest expectations and I would highly recommend it - regardless of your musical taste. I think this is going to be my favorite for a while.

B0002JJBZY|5.0|I have always been a fan of star trek from the original all the way to Enterprise. The original series may not have the special effects that you see in the later series or Trek movies but there something unique and special to the heart about this old school series that makes it stands out above the rest of the series.  I highly reccomend this among all Trek series fans.
1401300901|3.0|The book was allright, but I bought it because I am a Gerard Butler fan and he will be in the movie with Hilary Swank playing her dead husband.

B000GIWS7E|5.0|This DVD is great from the opening track thru the encore. LaBrie's vocals are the best they've ever been on a live performance. The band is perfection, as always; you never hear an errant chord, a bad key, or a rim shot. The lead solos and battles between Petrucci and Ruddess are spectacular. Never has there been 2 players that compliment each other in song as these two. The orchestra, used on the 2nd half of the show, is a wonderful addition. I know lots of bands have done this, including Kiss, Metallica, Scorpions, and others, but Progressive Rock has a lot of chord changes, tempo changes, etc. versus a half a dozen chord changes that many rock songs require. <br /> <br />Anyone reading the tracklist will realize they trace their roots on the selection of songs.  The nice thing is that the songs, especially LaBrie's vocals, sound like a live performance from the time period the song first came out. Vocalists often start losing their higher range as they get older and the bands adlib a lot because they've forgotten the \\"original\\" way it was played.  Not D/T. It just sounds like their studio versions played live. That's a good thing. Oh sure, they add their own little D/T ditties, but for the most part they're dead on. The 2nd half of the show, with the orchestra, covers their more recent epics, including 6 degrees, Octavarium, and an awesome version of Metropolis. <br /> <br />Even at over 2 hours long, I could have listened for twice that. It was THAT enjoyable.  Buy it, you will not be disappointed.
B00005JPBP|5.0|Fans of Christopher Nolan's other classic--Memento--will know going in not to expect a straight-forward, cut-and-dried story. <br /> <br />The Prestige, a film about two up-and-coming stage magicians locked in a violent feud, has more twists than Chubby Checker on speed. The narrative, jumping around in time and from character to character, might be slightly confusing at first but eventually you get a handle on it. The morality is murky through-out, fitting a shadow-filled and dark cinematography; this is a film of ambience and feeling, powerfully suspenseful. <br /> <br />An all-star cast does a great job with the material, including a surprise performance by David Bowie as famous Edison-rival Nikola Tesla (!). <br /> <br />Obviously, I cannot say too much here without giving away things that should be revealed over the course of viewing, so I'll leave it here. However what you're getting with The Prestige is: a fine-acted, well-directed, dark, twisty/turny suspense-filled mystery populated by characters with secrets and highly-questionable ethics. If that's your sort of thing (see: Memento), then you'll like this too.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|For those of you who have been and always will be a Robert Plant fan, this is the CD for you to play everyday. The vocals and arrangements are excellent. On Tin Pan Valley you get to hear that awesome Plant Wail. I'll make it simple this a completely fantastic CD, Robert still totally has it.
B000002OX5|5.0|I have listened to this album for over 20 years and was stunned at this reissue.  There were so many details that I had never heard, Entwistle's bass thunders from your speaker in startling detail.  The bonus tracks are excellent, basically this classic album is now expanded to double-lp length.
1932100660|5.0|Although most of modern day America will not want to hear the research this book relates, it is fascinating - a little infuriating, and very interesting.  The facts and information presented on our health care system and mostly about our Standard American Diet have led me to a complete diet change - and I feel GREAT now!  I also know I'm doing what is best for my body.  The book is easy to read and understandable even with the research statistics.  I would encourage anyone who is interested in their health to read this, but be warned - you may not like what you learn.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|It was an accident when I listened a Wolfmother's song and it was \\"Joker and the Thief\\". I can't rememeber when I had a simmilar surprise because they are so diferent from the selfproclaimed Rock bands in these days, they are real Rock, no mix with rap, a hard and real sound, the lyrics and the rythm. If you miss new music that sound like Zeppelin and other legends, give this group a chance. No regrets, I promise.

6305736650|5.0|This movie was literally filmed as it was being written and was not believed to be anything special.  Little did they know!  This is one of the best movies of all time, and is as relevant today as it was in 1942.
B000260R82|4.0|The production is beautiful and the musical performances are, for the most part, very good.  The soprano is a bit relentless in her sadness (visually, body language, etc.) but she sings very well.  Altogether I would say this is a good choice for anyone wanting a traditional approach to this essential opera. <br />rwu
1400032717|5.0|\\"And now if I don't know what someone is saying I ask them what they mean . . .\\"<br /><br />This is a murder mystery.  Most murder mysteries answer 2 questions: 1) Who did it? 2) Why did they do it?  While those answers are often interesting, I'm not a big fan of the genre because the murderer never turns out to be the reader of the book.  In real life, justice and the more enabling solutions are not found in simply finding someone else to blame, understanding their reasons for being destructive, and punishing them. It's more interesting to discover reasons to become more creative. This book is a well-motivated creative act.  It is about the murder of a dog, which is unusual according to the narrator's therapist Siobhan \\"because readers cared more about people than dogs.\\"  But the narrator, a 15 yr old boy named Christopher, counters \\"I wanted to write about something real . . . and I cared about dogs because they were faithful and honest, and some dogs were cleverer and more interesting than some people.\\"<br /><br />Christopher's father, Ed, warns him to \\"Keep your nose out of other people's business\\" and to not investigate who killed the dog. \\"It's a bloody dog, Christopher, a bloody dog.\\" Christopher replies, \\"I think dogs are important, too.\\" His father shouted, \\"I said leave it, for God's sake.\\" But Christopher chooses not to leave it alone because it made him feel \\"happy, because I was being a detective and finding things out.\\"  Ed goes further, demanding that Christopher not mention Mr. Shears' name, not talk to Mrs. Shears, and not to ask anyone who killed that bloody dog.  At first we don't know if Ed's moves to isolate and silence Christopher are protective.  Only later do we find out his threats are primarily motivated by pride.  The dog was an able comfort and support for Mrs. Shears.  Sometimes Cain kills Able for his own proud reasons.

B000BEZQ0Y|4.0|A most beautiful soundtrack to a visually beautiful movie.  The piano of Jean-Yves Thibaudet is quite superb (he comes to Sydney soon for concerts at the Sydney Opera House), and the music is the most uplifting movie score I've heard for ages.  The one criticism I would offer is the fact that the order of play on the CD is not in sync with how the music is used in the movie, and so you can't necessarily follow through in the proper order in your imagination.  However, that aside, it's a really lovely musical experience, and very evocative of the movie itself.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|As a true John Mayer fan, I can tell you that this album is one of his best yet.  Although all of his music is good, if you were to purchase just one of his cd's this is the one to get.  Every song is a hit.
B000000OR9|1.0|What are these reviewers listening to????? If you're age is more than single diget, there can be no reason for a positive review. This is so bad, that I could hardly force myself to listen to the whole cd at least once. I loved SYKES work with THIN LIZZY and was expecting something pretty good. This sets a new benchmark for innane lyrics and rotten recycled riffs. THIS IS COMPLETELY MINDLESS DRIVEL!!!! And those are the better points. I would guess that MARCEL MARCEAU was the sound engineer and that the production was handled by OZZY in a very wasted state. If there is a good guitar solos on this one, it is completely lost in the horrid mix. I am just glad that they achieved the success they so richly deserve   -    total unnonimity. If your familie name isn't SYKES, than there is absolutely no reason to waste money on this shocker.

B000002U94|5.0|Classic Bob Seger performance. For the lovers of Bob's music this is a must buy. Recorded during his heyday with the advantage of being \\"In Concert\\". You can enjoy his passion and driving force which can only be heard with a live recording.

B00005BJ9W|5.0|I was just the right age to be a Duranie - I was 15 during their 1983/1984 US tour - and I threw myself into it with gusto. I used to listen to the first three albums every single day. I still listen to those albums, but this, their second, seems to get on the playlist a bit more often. This is the only one of their albums that I own on vinyl, cassette, and CD, and have burned to extra CDs so I always have it in my car and by my computer. Obsessive? Yep, that's me. But who can resist the haunting beauty of Save a Prayer, the pop-iness of Hungry Like a Wolf and Rio, and the endless riddle of Simon's poetry?
B00065MDSQ|5.0|This is one of the Best King Crimson efforts and is recommended along with Court of the Crimson King and Night Watch as my favorites for Fripp,Bruford and Wetton.

0618526412|1.0|Please take the time to consider what kind of reader you are.  I hated this book.  It took me at least 6 months to read this because I could not force myself to read it.  But that being said I also hate stream of consciousness and now wished that I had looked at some reviews and realized that was what I was getting myself into.  I read 'As I Lay Dying' in High School and hated it too.  There is no plot, and no point.  I hated it.
B000006JPI|5.0|This is a CD not a Cassette. It is a great 8 track version from Castle records.  The tracks are: Caught Somewhere in Time, Wasted Years, Sea Of Madness, Heaven Can Wait, The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, Stranger in a Strange Land, Deja-Vu, and Alexander the Great.
B000AP04OM|2.0|Though the DVD has some really nice extras (interviews, etc.), the restoration leaves a lot to be desired.  Much clarity is lost from the original.  Almost blurry, like multiple images that don't properly align (the actors all have \\"zombie eyes\\").  Not really watchable.  Now shopping for the unrestored version.
0142004235|3.0|I first read EAST OF EDEN when I was in my early teen years and remembered I was absolutely captivated by it. (I had run out of reading material and raided my mother's bookshelves at the time) I remembered the story read as a sort of soap opera with larger than life characters and I simply couldn't wait to find out what would happen next. It also helped that the novel takes place in California - where I live - and that just seemed to add to my enjoyment. <br /> <br />So, when I picked this novel up again I was very much looking forward to it once again. I felt I would be re-visiting a few old friends. I was to be sadly mistaken. Unfortunately, this go round I found this novel tedious and mostly boring. Gone were the larger than life characters. They had been replaced with people who seemed more unreal than anything else. Steinbeck rambles and meanders - a lot - to the point where I wanted to simply skip entire chapters or yell, \\"Get to the point!\\" He wrote this book towards the end of his career, and during a very bleak time in his life, and it seems to show. There is no focus. Steinbeck takes the reader on a long, rambling walk over the hills of California and when it concludes, we've no idea why we went or for what purpose. I doubt Steinbeck knew, either. <br /> <br />I think the biggest problem I have this go round that I didn't have when I read this book the first time, is that I compare it to THE GRAPES OF WRATH. By far, this novel comes far, far short of that one, and that is perhaps where I'm making my error.  <br /> <br />The language of Steinbeck is beautiful, there can be no doubt. He can truly transport a reader to another place and time! But I would recommend that if one decides to read only one Steinbeck novel in their life, let it be GRAPES OF WRATH, and not this one. It is a far better written book and far more important one as well. However, if one feels s/he wants to tackle this project, just be prepared that it is not easy to wade through. It is tedious, more than a bit boring at times, and very easy to put down. However, one may find it worthwhile in the end.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|I can only describe this tv show in one word...AWESOME!!!!!!!! Supernatural is by far my favorite tv show. Every episode is really interesting & makes me sit on the edge of my seat. The actors are really good too. It helps that Jensen Ackles is really good looking! Really great show. Even if you don't believe in supernatural beings & forces (which I don't) you still may really love the show. The DVD set has deleted scenes and commentary and all sorts of interesting tidbits from the show, creators, & actors.
B000053V7Q|5.0|I remember seeing the movie when it originally came out, and thinking how all the rock stars of that day appeared so unimpressive compared to Elvis....so I bought the movie and the same is still true today. I guess that's why he's still the king.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|This movie is well acted, well written and certainly a thinking person's movie.  Not many Americans know the background to Guy Fawkes Day which is celebrated annually in England.  Suppression, and religious freedom are the issues.  Things haven't changed much in certain parts of the world. It can be viewed as a movie questioning the existing order, doing something about it, and gaining the upper hand.  A price is paid naturally.
B000I5X81K|3.0|First of all, no one can deny that Mr. Groban is blessed with wonderful voice that requires little professional training to become a well-known vocalist. However, let's be honest and not forget the fact that he is fairly young as an artist. <br /> <br />After learning the release of this album, I went out search around town and on-line , acquired the DVD edition with bonus tracks, since I was quite impressed by his previous two ablums and owning both of them. <br /> <br />As you probably can guess, I am quite disappointed by this album after forcing myself into listening in a dozen times, I decided to remove it from CD player.  <br /> <br />The reasons are fairly simple - <br />1. The taste level of song selection is very questionable. It's not quite up to the previous albums. I actually find it hard to stay \\"awake\\" or even concentrate enough while listening. <br />2. His previous albums were back up by excellent song selection, music editing and high quality of production. All that enhanced his voice and made 2 successful albums. You can not find any of that in this album, in short, this album does not play into his advantage but expose his weakness vocally if you listen carefully. <br />3. Lucky me, I got the DVD edition with bonus tracks which makes me feel slightly better about the money I spent on it.  <br /> <br />I am a fan of \\"voice\\". Mr. Groban's voice unfortunately doesn't work as well as I would anticipate for this album. For some people, good looking may be more important, but I side with some other folks here that this is not a good album of Mr. Groban compare with his previous works. <br /> <br />If you still plan to get this album, as it has been suggested by others, get the DVD edition with bonus tracks to make your money worth. <br /> <br />Again, his next album may be excellent, but this one, is just not my cup of tea.
B000GTJT0M|2.0|The sound and picture are very good.  It's a bit fuzzy where it should but but it's clearly done appropriately.  Some of the snow scenes look absolutely beautiful.  The movie itself well....sucks.

B0002X314C|5.0|I waited until after the hype ended before purchasing this album and all I have to say is \\"Wow!\\".  I haven't heard anything this good since the first time I played my older brother's 8-track of Earth, Wind & Fire back in 1974.  Legend is hip-hop's answer to Beck with his mixes.<br /><br />Definitely one of my top 100 albums of all time.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I'm a musical fan, especially the really sing-able ones, and this one thoroughly satisfies me.  I like these arrangements and having the soundtrack enhanced my enjoyment of the stage production immensely.  I heartily endorse this CD.
0679745653|4.0|Most people have seen the movie but have not bothered to read the book.  It's worth it.  It's not long and won't take long to read, but you will enjoy his writing.  His desriptions seem fresh even 40+ years later.  Compared to many of today's popular novels, this may seem too slow or quiet, but it's so well written, it's a joy to read.

0618680004|5.0|Dr. Richard Dawkins book \\"The God Delusion\\" can open one's eyes to the fallacies of religion and a god. However, I did find the book to be weak in some instances. Not in regard to the arguments set forth as being incorrect, but in the sense that the information was not presented with the hard facts and evidence that is available. The book was not as critical as I had thought it would have been. I know it is difficult to write a book and try to include many ideas in the sense that it did not present the hard undisputable facts, artifacts and evidence of biology, astronomy, evolution and paleontology. I think Dr. Dawkins in his book may have been trying to reach the general public who is unacquainted with science and he did not want to bog down the reader with anything that would be too taxing on the mind.  Dr. Dawkins does present in his book that \\"god\\" should be viewed as a hypothesis, which I do not agree with completely. In his book, Dr. Dawkins indicates that it is amazing how people automatically accept god as factual and truthful without any evidence besides a book and what is taught in the church. I think most of the religious could not and would not even consider god being relegated to a hypothesis. However, the presence of a supernatural being known as \\"god\\" is not a testable hypothesis due to fact there isn't any evidence, nor artifacts to test it. The hypothesis is basically void due to the inability to test it. This inability of scientists to test the existence of god is a straw for the religious to grasp. In their way of thinking, scientists can not disprove the existence of god, therefore god exists. This is the kind illogical argument or path that the religious follow. Just because something can not be disproved does not mean something exists.<br /><br />Therefore it is quite understandable that Dawkins does not participate in debates with the religious on the matter of god etc...I agree with him. Sometimes it seems almost pointless. It is sometimes scary as well considering how insecure, irrational and the violent nature that some people of the religious persuasion can have toward anyone questioning the existence of their God. The prejudice against the atheist is substantial although a conservative estimate of the numbers of atheists in the United States could be as little as 15 million people or as high as 30 million, maybe more. Dawkin's points out the prejudice against the atheist through the comments made by George Bush Sr. regarding whether he recognized the equal citizenship and patriotism of Americans who are atheists: \\"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God.\\" Dawkins goes on to say that the reader should try an experiment of replacing atheist with \\"Jews\\", \\"Muslims\\" or \\"Blacks\\" in that statement made by George Bush Sr. How well would it go over if \\"Blacks\\" replaced the word atheist.  There are thousands of atheists who have served their country in wars throughout the years including several members of my family who served in both WWI and WWII.<br /><br />It is almost as if some people are programmed to believe god and religion although an avalanche (more like 10 avalanches) of evidence supports the scientific explanation for the creation our tiny miniscule planet (The Earth) and all life on it as it is in relation to the immense and infinite universe. Most people want the easy button to explain things. God and religion is the easy button. It is wrapped up in a nice neat package and it is easy to understand. However, physics, astronomy, evolutionary science and biology are another matter. It is complex and may be out of the realm of some people's intellectual understanding.<br /><br />One of the main points that Dr. Dawkins brings forth is the indoctrination of children into religion. Children who have not yet formed the capabilities of thinking in a critical manner to access whether religion and a god is the kind of thinking that is right or even healthy for them. They are not even given a chance. It is given to them right from the beginning. The question of \\"Why not let the child decide once they are adults if religion is right for them\\" arises. Dr. Dawkins points out that Christianity as well as Islam teaches children that unquestioned faith is a virtue. I think it is sad that children are being \\"brainwashed\\" to further the untruths and unsubstantiated claims of the Christian religion and all other religions around the world.<br /><br />Dr. Dawkin's book is a great book in combination with such books as \\"Evolution and the Myth of Creationism by Dr. Tim M. Berra, \\"From So Simple a Beginning, The Book of Evolution by Philip Whitfield, \\"Evolution vs. Creationism by Eugenie C. Scott and \\"Atheist Universe\\" by David Mills.<br />The book by Dr. Tim Berra presents the anthropological and paleontology arguments for evolution along with brief criticism of creationism. Philip Whitfield's book gives a very good overview of evolution. Both books by Scott and Mills present arguments rebutting intelligent design and creationism along with the dangers of such thinking and its effects on the education of children.<br /><br />I think by reading Dr. Dawkin's book along with the other four books that I mentioned above would give a person who is inquiring a sound basic introduction to this matter. The study of psychology, biology, geology, astronomy, physics and anthropology would give the person the depth of understanding that would help them understand how things actually work and function in this world. Instead most people would rather rely on the sloppy, slippery, constantly shifting timelines of the imprecise writings and teachings of the religious factions that permeate this world, which brainwashes the vulnerable and unsuspecting in the United States and throughout the world.<br /><br />Religion and the faith in a god is medieval thinking. As our nation continues into the 21st century, it is unfathomable that many people still hold onto such superstitious, nonsensical beliefs that should be relegated to the dark ages. If people devoted as much time to reading and learning a few things about the earth and its natural creation then they do reading the bible and going to church, they would realize how ridiculous they have been all this time by believing in such a fairytale.

B000BT97AO|5.0|Watching Mirrormask is like being immersed in the absolute best of dreams; the kind that pull us out of ourselves and makes us wonder who we really are inside. This may sound a bit cheesy, but the imagery in this movie is fascinating, and simply, just really fun to watch. Mirrormask it not a once-through movie, once you see it once, you want to see it again, the visuals are just too much for simply one go. And this is one of the great beauties of the movie: for all of the complex visual that it offers, the storyline offers the delicious contrast of being rather simple and sweet. Definitely a children's movie that really delivers.

A way to differentiate your business from the rest in your industry and quit fighting over diminishing returns in the bloody \\"red ocean\\" that most of us compete within.

I would stronly recommend this CD and would urge anyone who enjoys this CD to check out their past CD's.  Every song is unique in its own way and I don't think you can put a lable on the type of music, its extreamly unique, the lyrics are intriguing.  Davey Havok's vochals are also amazing.

B000H7JD4K|5.0|I am a Maiden Fan since their first record (that time still vinyl). Although I did like the records they oput out in the last 10 years, I didn't really 'Love' them. They sounded to clean and elaborated for me. <br /> <br />With this one, they returned to the power and roughness I was missing lately. The record caught me during my first listening (rare for me) and got only better from there. For anyone loving plain and straight Heavy Metal - this is the record to have!!!

B0000A1RJI|3.0|Overall I liked this soundtrack as it contains the musical highlights of the film. However, the production aspects of the CDROM are lacking. First, it appears the individual tracks were made from one best-of type of arrangement. This arrangement doesn't follow the story-line from the movie, so it seems almost arbitrary in nature, even though the composer/arranger might have written it that way originally. Secondly, the dynamic range of the music is so great that it isn't possible to listen to it at one volume level in most venues. Parts of the music are inaudible unless the volume is turned way up and then the sections of fortissimo are bound to disturb the neighbors three doors down, unless one is listening alone in a sound proof room. In fact the climactic moments cause distortion on my ipod nano headphones, even when at a volume level of only 75%. While it may be technologically feasible to produce a range of this level, I question the benefit it has to humans. Maybe if I let my dog use my ipod or play this soundtrack underwater for a whale, they'll be able to fully appreciate the full spectrum of the experience. Finally, the album is too short. For a full length feature film you would think they could have put together more for us but maybe there was a lot of looping in the movie that would have made much of the content on the CD redundant. <br />It's a good buy though, given its faults, for any fan of the series. <br />

B00005JPBJ|4.0|There aren't many movies that can make me grimace and squirm in my seat. Only two movies have ever scared me, and I think that once, perhaps, I jumped a bit in my seat at a part where the rest of the theater gasped or screamed. This is one of those few movies that made me squirm. The gruesome - but not gratuitous - torture scenes are creative and original, and the \\"special effects\\", i.e., what they do to make us believe that a guy really is breaking his own foot to be able to get out of shackles is just brilliant. <br /> <br />The inclusion of Amanda's character, and her own private struggles, gives this installment of the Saw trilogy - in my opinion - a stronger story line. Not only are there the \\"games\\" we have come to enjoy and expect, there are two psychologically damaged characters (Jigsaw and Amanda) to watch interact and develop. <br /> <br />The plot is fairly straightforward, but we don't realize this until we get to the end. In essence, Jigsaw is dying and he recruits the help of a beautiful young doctor who just happens to be the best in her field. That's the first extension of disbelief the movie demands. The climax asks us to *really* suspend disbelief, as it could not have happened if it weren't for a remarkable coincidence of concurrent events. This didn't do too much to hurt the film, but it certainly would have been nicer to end on a stronger, tighter note. <br /> <br />This is forgivable, because the rest of the film was very logical and things happened in their appropriate sequence. <br /> <br />3.5/5, rounded up to 4. <br />

B0009P42S2|3.0|I don't believe that this a ground-breaking animation feature as has been suggested. The animation was good, but certainly not great; that said, the sepia tones were effective in translating the viewer through time. The concept was certainly inventive, but all the characters were classic archetypes with little to no originality in their personalities/actions. <br /> <br />It took two sittings for me to finish the movie. I almost passed on the second \\"sitting\\" because I knew how the story would end. (I turned out to be right.) <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A new high point in sci-fi westerns with cursing in Chinese. Okay, it's the only point, but it is a high one. Most episodes are great, and one or two are merely good. The DVD extras reveal that the experience the cast and crew had producing the series was just as special as the experience the audience had (and now by virtue of this set - has) watching it. <br /> <br />Joss Whedon, who created the series and wrote/directed some episodes, put together a cast with great chemistry. I found myself getting fully drawn into the stories, action, imagery, humor, and characters. The addition of colloquialisms-of-the-future was a nice touch. If you like the Buffy or Angel series (which he created too), this is different though the amount/type of humor and some of the character (not characters) are similar. You'll also recognize several of the actors. <br /> <br />It's a great series that was cancelled many years too soon. Check out the 'pilot' movie, Serenity. It explains quite a bit that the series never got around to. <br /> <br />There is violence, foul language in Chinese, and surprisingly harsh attitudes displayed toward Inara, the resident \\"companion.\\" So, it may not be appropriate for children, perhaps even less appropriate for Chinese-speaking children.
0486227073|3.0|In reality, this book didn't teach me anything I didn't know already. The illustrations may be handy for someone who hasn't had much experience with body-mechanics, bending, joints, etc. This book was neither outstanding nor worthless, thus my bland 3 star review...
B000BEZQ0Y|4.0|I absolutely loved the music from the movie and was very excited when I discovered this book of easy piano music. While I took lessons for years, I find that I'm a bit rusty when it comes to playing so this book fit the bill exactly for me!! It is very easy to read, although playing it does not translate exactly to the music in the movie. The music in the movie is much more sweeping and this book doesn't quite fit that bill, but I'm just very happy to be able to play some of it!
B000G03Q2S|5.0|One of the few releases in the history of rock that continually delivers the goods, despite massive amounts of critical and not-so-critical raves over 40 years. You could almost say that this album, in the face of all of the good reviews it's received, is underrated. The fuzzy packaging is nice, too, though it's not as fuzzy as I hoped. Heck, I had to find something to complain about!
0553266306|3.0|...but I do not remember it being as slow the last time I read it as it was for me this time.  Maybe it has more to do with my difficulties pronouncing all of the incredibly long french names and words.
0553801503|4.0|The book and this series, has been a good read, good story, and entertaining, although the story seems to be a bit long and drawn out. Capitalism has its price does it not (more books more money)? The series far surpasses its counter parts in the same genre such as the authors of the \\"Wheel of Time\\", and Terry Goodkind. I found them to be tedious and boring to be honest with you. I do not understand people's fascinations with that type of writing; then again, some people think that Steven King is a good author.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Marvelous British mini-series.  Great historical detail highlights a good love story.  I may have to buy a second copy - this one is about worn out.
B0006J28KU|4.0|My 18 year old son and his 60 year old dad both love this movie. The casting is just about perfect - especially Robert DeNiro in a \\"sympathetic\\" role as a criminal. Al Pacino is also outstanding as a flawed but determined cop. Michael Mann does an excellent job of distilling LA both visually and geographically.
0307346609|4.0|actually, this was quite good for its genre...well thought out with apparent effort
B00005JKNC|4.0|This is a great movie for people who like Jim Carrey and wish he would receive more serious roles.  He is a talented actor and should be recognized for something besides his ability to be crazy.  It is somewhat idealistic in the way the story line is presented but what the heck, its a fantasy, wouldn't it be nice if a town could be that supportive.
1401302378|4.0|In my ongoing attempt to reach for the brave new opportunities of Internet business, I recently read The Long Tail (Hyperion, 2006) by Chris Anderson, editor of Wired Magazine. The book provides all the logic you might ever need for understanding why, as the subtitle says, \\"the future of business is selling more of less.\\" As the Internet enables a shift \\"from mass culture to massively parallel culture,\\" Anderson says that micro markets are strengthening while mass markets are weakening.<br /><br />The book consolidated three perspectives for me:<br /><br />1. Big hits will continue to exist but will draw fewer loyal customers. Blockbuster products will continue to exist, but the definition of a blockbuster is changing. Anderson offers some data-rich case studies to make his point.<br />2. Contrary to the wisdom once prevalent in business schools, it is no longer imperative to create blockbusters in order to create sustainable profitability.<br />3. The old nostrum about 80% of profits deriving from 20% of products is widely misunderstood and not well supported by the current business environment. When costs of inventory and distribution are low, as they often are in Internet-facilitated transactions, there is less reason to concentrate on 20% of products.<br /><br />The title derives from the traditional depiction of the statistical bell curve, in which the high curve in the middle represents the greatest volume of the phenomenon being measured and the flat ends represent the low-volume \\"tails.\\" Those tails, says Anderson, are lengthening infinitely as the Internet delivers unprecedented variety to mass audiences. The height of the curve is simultaneously flattening.<br /><br />Though Anderson doesn't go into it deeply, the \\"long tail\\" phenomenon clearly has big implications for the future of labor and management. Many emerging niches, Anderson points out, are being created by self-organizing, voluntary peer production networks. For examples, think of open source software collaborators, indie movie makers, self-published book authors, blog operators, and self-appointed scientists. (An excellent book on this phenomenon is Eric S. Raymond's [[ASIN:0596001088 The Cathedral & the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary]], published by O'Reilly Media in 2001.<br /><br />Indeed, because of volunteer, self-organizing labor, says Anderson, everything will soon make it to market. (Everything?) One of the major opportunities in this scenario will be for aggregators who help buyers make sense of it all.<br /><br />Anderson has a compelling, readable style, though a few of the economics discussions are a little jargon-happy. In other reviews, some have commented that The Long Tail leads the reader to the precipice of new insight, but leaves you without a method for taking a confident leap into this new world. Anderson does not claim to offer this kind of how-to advice, but the absence of it is a bit frustrating. Overall, though, The Long Tail leaves you better equipped to think about where it is all going -- business, career and management -- and where you fit within it.ers, self-published book authors, blog operators, and self-appointed scientists.

B000BNI90O|5.0|All I can say is Thank You for making this set of CD's.  They corrected all of the problems from the original soundtracks.  Every song in the movie is on this set of CD's in the order it appeared in the movie.  The sounds are all rich and gorgeous.  Fantastic!  The DVD containing the entire score on one disc (as opposed to the three CD's in the set) that comes with it is great also - the only limitation will be your sound system.  This set is worth the money.  I can't wait for the next two soundtracks to come out.
1400032717|5.0|I loved this book for all the reasons stated by the other reviewers.  <br /> <br />But I don't have the book with me and I think the parts about prime numbers states that 2 is a prime and 1 is a prime. I read a paperback in Europe. Can anyone help me with this? I is not a prime number... <br /> <br />But read this book. It gave me such good advice.
0553381695|4.0|All around I liked this book very much. It was less sad then the other one but continued and hightened the already great story line. My biggest complaint is the more heavely introduced magic in this one. Although it still plays an extreamly minor role.
078322740X|4.0|I happen to be a huge Goldie Hawn fan so loved this movie. This is also a fun movie for Steve Martin fans. Dana Delaney plays the love interest of Steve Martin's character. When she rejects him he meets a fun and spontaneous woman played by Goldie Hawn. Pretending to be someone that you are not can somehow make a fantasy life turn into reality with a little love thrown in.
B000301YY8|5.0|I bought this CD for the one song \\"You're Beautiful\\" and it turns out that I love every song on the CD.  It is the only thing I play in my car most of the time.  Never heard of this guy before I heard You're Beautiful, but now I think I would buy any CD he made, without hearing any of it.  Quite talented.  Very enjoyable.

What really scares me is the number of so-called Cognocenty that turn a Blind Eye to the obvious.  The snow on Mt. Kilimanjaro is shrinking.  The Polar Ice Caps are diminishing.  The Glaciers in Skandinavia and British Columbia are vanishing.  Hey, a few years back, they found the body of George (Because It's There) Mallory near the top of Mount Everest.  He'd been buried in snbow ever since he died.  And we still get these dofusses saying Global Warming is all in our head.<br /><br />I live on a Tropical Island.

Our 3 year old has asked for it to be played at least four times since yesterday (when it arrived), and our 1 year old gets all excited and starts making car noises when he watches it with his brother. The movie is very entertaining, with an excellent soundtrack, a good story and best of all, it teaches a lesson. Way to go Disney/Pixar!
B000002C2E|4.0|It is difficult to rate and review 'Time Out of Mind,' Bob Dylan's start to a string of late Renaissance achievements.  The album, which is named after Mercutio's line before Romeo crashes the Capulets' masquerade ball in 'Romeo and Juliet, 'finds Dylan \\"Love Sick\\" with a world that has gone wrong and left him bewildered.  These subject matters are deftly taken up with the blues with his excellent new band and Daniel Lanois at the producer helm and Jack Frost just in the wings.  The highlights are hallmark.  Even though his voice has aged and is more gravelly, it does appropriately remind one of Leon Redbone, which suits his new endeavors well.  \\"Love Sick\\" is thick and bottom-line.  With some hefty guitar chords he sings his heart out.  Then, he comes up with \\"Dirt Road Blues,\\" arguably the C.D.'s best song.  With what can be described as rockabilly blues, he and his band transport us to the Texas border for some hot chili.  \\"Starting in the Doorway\\" reminds us of his vintage work.  Sometimes this number gets as languorous, however, like the \\"...summer night...\\" he walks through.  Similarly, \\"Million Miles\\" is good blues, even if the title tells us much about the length of the destination.  \\"Trying to Get to Heaven\\" and the beautifully shimmering \\"Not Dark Yet,\\" really hit the spot with two of his top songs here.  Also worthy of his latter legacy is the celebrated ballad, \\"Make You Feel My Love,\\" which is as eloquent and substantial as his best love songs.  Also good quality can be found with the heavy \\"Cold Irons Bound\\".  This song lingers a bit too long, but especially the closer, \\"Highlands,\\" doesn't come close to reaching the destination and isn't close to climbing to the heights of a classic like \\"Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands\\".      'Time Out of Mind' was able to capture enough attention by landing Dylan on the cover of 'Newsweek' magazine.  He deserved it anyway, but this album is a mixed comeback, providing some disapointment despite the hype.  In spots hedelivers his old genius in a different venue, but 'Oh, Mercy,' before it, and 'Modern Times,' after it demonstrate that there are a lot of Dylan classics to be found more worthy than 'Time Out of Mind'.

B000F4RHB6|5.0|Being a child in the 80's, it was kind of hard to avoid being subjected to the videos and singles on the radio of Huey Lewis & The News, particularly during their peak popularity years of 83 to 86.<br /><br />Most critics loathed them, audiences (in particular yuppies & baby boomers) loved their music.  They would explode in popularity with 1983's #1 album Sports followed by the 1986 #1 followup Fore!.<br /><br />But their popularity would not be seen as enduring as their star power/album sales would start to drop with 1988's Small World (only got to #11) and 1991's Hard at Play (peaked at #27 on the album charts.)<br /><br />The band would then release a compilation in 1996 called Time Flies (that contained hits plus 4 great new tracks), a covers album a couple of years prior and a new (and great) studio album in 2001 called Plan B.<br /><br />This new Greatest Hits collection released in 2006 has 21 tracks on it (though only 20 are with The News, the track Crusin' was a duet that Huey did with Gwenyth Paltrow  from the movie Duets) and provides an excellent overview of the band's career/sound.<br /><br />All of the hits are here in addition to a couple of album cuts sprinkled throughout.  The only glaring omission is that nothing from their 1st self titled album is represented here. While I realize that they didn't start getting popular until 1982's album Picture This (that had the smash single \\"Do You Belive in Love\\"), you would think that they would have at least put one track from it on here.<br /><br />Another thing is that a lot of greatest hits compilations, you'll find some single edits on here so that they can cram more tracks on the disc.  But the sound quality is great on here as all of the tracks have been remastered to crystal clear sound quality.<br /><br />The only 2 radio edits that bug me are the edits of The Heart of Rock 'n' Roll & I Want a New Drug.  If they had dropped the inclusion of Cruisin' (which is out of place as it isn't a song with The News) then they would've had the room to put the album versions of these 2 songs in particular on there.  While I know that a lot of people only know their songs from the radio anyway, the album versions of these 2 tracks are superior versions.<br /><br />Also, with almost any greatest hits collections, one could lament about the omission of particular tracks in favor of other ones, but with only 80 minutes to work with (this CD clocks in at 79:17), there's only so much they can cram on here.<br /><br />Another thing is that none of the 4 fantastic 1996 studio tracks from Time Flies are on here.  Also, nothing from their 2001 album Plan B is on here as well.<br /><br />If you're just a passive fan, I would recommend just getting this Greatest Hits disc as it does improve on their prior 1996 compilation in most respects.<br /><br />But for people wanting more, I would recommend getting this (most place sell this for only 10 dollars), Plan B (you can find it used for only 5 dollars) and  Time Flies (it's out of print but you can find it easily used for 5 dollars at most places).<br /><br />But regardless, this is a great package. The liner notes are great, all of the chart positions of the singles is given and for a single disc compilation, the only thing that could've improved this is the album versions of The Heart of Rock 'n' Roll & I Want a New Drug.<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />BTW, there's another version of this collection you can get for double the price that comes with a 50 minute DVD containing some (but not all) of their videos and a vintage live performance from 1982 (but not the whole concert). A bust in my opinion. Just stick with the regular CD version.um versions of these 2 songs in particular on there.

B000I5X81A|5.0|Apart from ECs \\"AUGUST\\" period, I've been a major fan of Clapton's work and have always respected and enjoyed JJ Cale. This collaboration is long overdue. other reviewers have commented on most of the specifics. I'll only add appreciation for the contribution of Derek Trucks (his slide work really stands out on the cuts he appears on). Great stuff!! I should also mention the bittersweet feeling at listening to Billy Preston on one of his last recordings (God bless, Billy). Clapton is in the enviable position of a survivor and has the smarts to properly deliver work at the level of the masters he learned from. First the \\"from the Cradle\\" package, then Riding with the King (B.B.) followed by the Robert Johnson recordings (wouldn't it have been wonderful if Johnson had been alive to make the album with him)? Now comes his duet with JJ Cale. Combined with last year's Cream reunion, it appears slowhand, after all his tragic life experiences, has learned not to take life for granted and do those things which are important while you are alive. This album is a testament to his maturity as a man and artist. JJ Cale is all over the album and it may lean musically mostly in his direction, but as a \\"life statement\\" it is about Clapton and his realization of the importance of making every living moment count. Great one Eric and JJ!!!

B00026WU7I|5.0|Dylan scored big on 'Blood on the Tracks,' perhaps the first of many comebacks.  The subject matter of love gone wrong has been taken elsewhere, especially with his wild, majestic 'Blonde on Blonde,' but 'Blood on the Tracks' finds him in fine folk form, able to draw more from experience and quiet passion.  The known songs are all great, including the mesmerizing hit \\"Tangled up in Blue,\\" the excellent and hypnotic \\"Simple Twist of Fate,\\" and the pensive \\"Shelter from the Storm\\".  Less heralded are other great songs, like, arguably the album's best, \\"Lily, Rosemary, and the Jack of Hearts\\".  Complete with a fine story and a rollicking accompaniment, \\"...the Jack of Hearts\\" comes up with aces musically and lyrically.  Quieter moments are highlighted with the beautiful serenade of \\"You're a Big Girl Now,\\" which only reminds one in style of another classic \\"Just Like a Woman\\".  There's also the acoustic ballad excellence of \\"If You See Her, Say Hello,\\" which is written like a letter to his lover's successor.  Still, there are moments when qualified brilliance is present.  \\"Idiot Wind\\" seems to gather more pungency from the delivery than the lyrical development.  \\"Buckets of Rain,\\" which ends the album caps off his folk excellence.  According to his memoir autobiography, 'Chronicles, Vol. I, Dylan wrote that he, to paraphrase, sabotoged his career to escape becoming a messiah.  In the liner notes, he is defined as a \\"troubadour\\".  Indeed, he truly found himself again on 'Blood on the Tracks'.  Too bad he had to find love gone sour to find his true footing once again.

B000FQ4M58|5.0|Meat Loaf returns with the third installment of the Bat out of Hell series.  Sub-titled  \\"The Monster is Loose\\", Meat Loaf does not disappoint with his strong vocals, superb duets, and inspiring rockers and ballads.  Bat Out of Hell III  has  a hard rock edge to it, more so than the previous Bat Out of Hell II.  However, it is the ballads that are the most sastisfying, especially with Meat Loaf's undeniable robust vocals.  \\"Cry Over Me\\" and \\"If God Could Talk\\" are perhaps some of Meat's best ballads ever performed, while \\"It's All Coming Back to Me\\" links this CD with its predecessors. <br />From the opening rocker \\"The Monster is Loose\\", to the appropriate ending \\"Cry to Heaven\\", Bat Out of Hell III is a definite must have.
0895260131|5.0|This is a very good book for those seeking what the Koran actually says and how theocratically motivated people act and think. There are hateful, arrogant, xenophobic elements in the Koran and thus ih Islam.To be fair the same thing is true of the Tanak [O.T] and the New Testament. The Western momotheistic religions have,at times, acted in despicable ways towards themselves and each other. This book helps us understand the potential of some elements in Islam.
B0001HAISG|5.0|This was a fantastic live action version of the popular tale. My 5 year old daughter and I enjoyed watching it.  There is one scene where Captain Hook first straps on his hook, which is a little graphic for little girls.  Otherwise its great fun.  One curious thing though- the actor who portrays the children's father is the same one who plays Hook.  What is the underlying meaning of this?  Are we supposed to notice or is it some subliminal message?

It holds many of the classics; a shame the techno show isn't on it (that was absolutely incredible) but honestly it is exactly what I want to hear when listening to Pink Floyd.  The best as they always are!  They couldn't be more perfect.  Their precision is on target and the blend is complimentary. <br /> <br />

NO! There is no such thing.  <br />Don't compare with works from the 60's or 70's...he doesn't repeat himself so don't look for \\"another\\" of anything.  <br />As he himself sings..\\"you think I'm past my prime? Well, whadda you got?\\" <br />What HE's got is still plenty darn good. Give it a listen.

B000068OCS|4.0|\\"Koyaanisqatsi\\" reminds me a bit of a 1980s National Geographic magazine a bit, just without the written words to back the pictures up. It's an 82 minute film of nothing but images of nature and cities, some sped up, others slowed down, with a soundtrack of \\"theatre music\\" by Phillip Glass. It's an interesting spectacle, but not quite as much as I thought it would be. <br /> <br />Director Godfrey Reggio has an eye for detail, and it makes for some fascinating shots, like the dance of cars across the traffic lights, the flow of the freeway like blood in a vein, the billowing of clouds and the detailed delicate crest of a breaking wave. It's interesting to see the people of New York during this period too, how they worked, how they walked, what they did for fun, etc. Trouble is, all these shots and music one after the other can get a little tiring after a while if you're not up for it. It's a film that does feel a little longer than it actually is sometimes. I mean, if you saw some of these shots in plot driven films with a proper context, you'd be impressed I'm pretty sure, but in this film sometimes their meaning and purpose is a little vague. I'm not the biggest fan of vague meanings. <br /> <br />The meaning I get out of them though, out of the whole film, is to do with rhythm. The clouds have it, the shadows have it, all of nature that can be seen has it. Man has rhythm too in his everyday life, in his habits, in the architecture of his systems, and definitely in his music (though it's more about a certain kind of repetition with Phillip Glass more than rhythm, I'd say). Trouble is, man's rhythm is a bit faster than what the world's set up for, and it may be putting life \\"out of balance\\" as the title suggests. <br /> <br />It's a good time capsule of the era (1983), an interesting bunch of shots, though you really have to be in the mood for it to watch it. Worth a look if you're interested, though.
B000H305U0|4.0|Who can deny that \\"SexyBack\\" is a different kind of headbanger? To a keen listener, you may not know it's Justin upon first hearing it. The sound is so different, so unexpected. But that's Timbaland's forte. You only have to listen to Missy Elliott to know why. The song has more chorus than verses, but you don't notice because the hook takes over. On another cut, it's clearly an homage to Prince. The music and lyrics are classic Prince. Not an easy task to pull off. Unlike the first CD, I can't play this one without skipping a mediocre track or two. Overall, I like it because it's a different sound and different from the first CD.

0099460254|5.0|Why has this book received so few reviews from US readers? Presumably, it is not being well promoted. That's a shame because this is the best popular science book for years. The author entertainingly explains the latest theories about the creation and development of language.  <br />After reading this book, the next time someone tells you that the English language is falling apart you will be able to explain how this is indeed true, but how other forces are inevitably changing it into a new language - which will also be falling apart! There is something inevitable and magnificent about the theories explained in this book.

B000GIWS7E|5.0|I've been a Dream Theater fan since Images and Words came out.  I'm an OK guitarist and a less than OK keyboard player, and I can really appreciate what these guys do musically, even if I can only play parts of their songs.  That goes for both their technical skills and their songwriting.  Their songs aren't empty background tracks so the band members can take turns doing solos - their songs are fantastic. <br /> <br />Anyways, I've seen all of their concert DVD's, and although I have a soft spot for Scenes from New York, I think this DVD is better.  The sound is simply amazing.  Hats off to whoever ran the sound board at that show, as I think it's the best sounding live recording I've ever listened to.  I'm not a huge fan of the \\"backup orchestra\\" bit in most cases, but it really added a lot to this DVD.  For the songs they played on, it sounded so natural that you find it hard to believe they didn't play on the studio recordings. <br /> <br />If you're a Dream Theater fan, this is a must buy.

6305428050|1.0|With all due respect to the director of Adventures in Babysitting, Chris Colombus, he helped create one of the most racist films in American cinematic history.<br /><br />Is it well crafted?  Yes.  Is the acting okay?  Yes.  Does it move along?  Heck, just like a windup toy.<br /><br />But please consider the plot:<br /><br />A white girl (Elizabeth Shue, lightyears from her work in Leaving Las Vegas) is baby-sitting several white kids, when she gets a desperate phone call from her white girl friend.  Why is her white girl friend desperate?  Because she is stuck in a downtown bus station, surrounded by (gasp) African Americans!<br /><br />Naturally, Shue races off, baby-sitting kids in tow, to rescue her friend from this tragic situation.  Maybe she should have called Jesse Jackson first, eh?<br /><br />When Shue gets downtown, various amusing adventures ensue.  But how can it be ignored that each of the adventures involves meeting someone who lives in the inner city who is African American.  And every single African American she meets is a criminal.  There is only one exception: (are you ready?  'spoiler' ahead!): the African Americans who sing and dance!<br /><br />Colombus must have been very disappointed that Steppin Fetchit (who adopted that stage name as a joke) was not alive and could not appear in his film.<br /><br />There is one African American who helps Shue and who does not sing and dance.  (Spoiler ahead) I kept hoping he would turn out to be an undercover cop.  But, no, he was a car thief.<br /><br />It would appear that Mr. Colombus is not aware of any non-singing, non-dancing African Americans who are not thieves, thugs or crooks.<br /><br />The film is a disgrace.  Really.  The fact that it is well produced makes it even worse--it can not be written off as a cheapy done by people who did not know better.<br /><br />For anyone who has seen Mr. Colombus' other films, however, the racism of this film should come as no surprise.  \\"Home Alone\\" was set in a similarly all white world (there was a single African American with a speaking part of a few lines, and no other non-white cast members).<br /><br />Even in J.R. Rowling's Harry Potter series, which devoted a great amount of time to racism issues (between 'muggles' and magic practitioners, a brilliant symbolic foray into racism by Rowling), Colombus managed to dilute her anti-racism message. Look at the first two Harry Potter films, which he directed: multi-cultural England in Colombus' hands becomes an almost entirely all white country.  Only after Colombus leaves the series do non-white actors get a chance.<br /><br />This film should not be praised.  It should be held up as an example of cultural bias and racism.<br /><br />I generally do not write negative reviews, but this film has been given a 'free ride' for way too long by American film critics.  But they are the same critics who praise 'Gone With the Wind', a four hour film about the civil war which does not once mention the word 'slave'.  The racism of 'Gone With The Wind' has been ignored by most reviewers.  It took a long time for me to realize how racist it was.  When I first saw it as a kid, I thought Scarlett O'Hara must have been a wonderful employer! I assumed that Scarlett must have had a wonderful dental plan for her African American employees, to keep them so loyal!aking part of a few lines, and no other non-white cast members).

B000FVQM2Y|5.0|The girl dies. There is the central event of this film. The young hero investigates how and why, moving through a cast of colourful (and oddly restrained) characters in the suprisingly self-contained world of an American high school. <br />The only downside to this film is in the dialogue: it was written wonderfully well (it was largely inspired by film noir dectective stories), but is sometimes not spoken clearly enough. Despite this, the film remains an involving story, and well worth viewing again.
B00005JPAD|5.0|Putting the boring stuff aside, I don't remember the last time that I enjoyed a hollywood film in the theater as much as I enjoyed \\"The Departed\\" I laughed out loud some 25 times at the behest of the direction that doesn't wait for you. I know this film is 2hours 20minutes long but it is also very fast, fast enough to keep you interested. When I saw \\"Casino\\" and \\"Goodfellas\\" - I thought these were one time off films. The magic of the two films could not be recreated. I was wrong. The Departed,somehow, recreates that delightfully fast feel and in ways undefined surpasses all expectations that a fan could possibly have from this film. This is a very intelligent film and resets standards for film making.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio , quite effortlessly, owns the show. And believe me - you will love the climax.

B000002JKA|5.0|One of the most amazing, articulate, and astonishing musically arranged and well executed masterpieces of its time, as is all of Dream Theatre's recording, studio or live. I'm a fan from the very first note (bass line) I heard from them when I was in a music store in Aruba in '93. With their diversity and theme changes, they continue to set new standards, not just in rock and roll, music in general. Yes, also a bit on the heavier side there is a lot of energy coming from within the band, but done so in a very musical manner. Own it and enjoy it.
0140157352|3.0|This book was definitely helpful, since I work in the purchasing professional.  In the profession you have to know when to be aggressive and when to back off shaded deals.  This book read broaden my perspective when it comes to getting my organization the best deal for a reasonable price.  Just recently I had to negotiate a bid for a couple million and some of the book points definitely kept me on the look out. In addition, the read made me aware of other points like; body languages.  When in the past I never even consider observing what the seller was really telling me. <br /> <br />I definitely agreed with one of your other reviewers that quoted \\" <br />This 72-word paragraph is awkward. In reality, it is two run-on paragraphs. A better rewrite, using 43 words, could be:  <br /> <br />\\"Any method of negotiation may be fairly judged by six criteria:  <br />* Meets the legitimate interests of each side  <br />* Resolves conflicting interests fairly  <br />* Is durable  <br />* Takes community interests into account.  <br />* Is efficient.  <br />* Improves the relationship between the parties.\\" <br /> <br />The bullets points are easily defined and clear; where as the long complex paragraph makes it too wordy\\".  In referencing to page 4, a fair deal for both parties are to come to a common place; a win - win both parties can live with in their decision.  Before reading this book, I had just completed the \\"Foundation to Negotiation\\" and find that this book was right on the dime.  <br />

B000GFLE86|3.0|Peyroux sings Leonard Cohen well and really makes his songs her own.  The weariness in her voice suits them.  I'd love to hear her sing more straight-up jazz standards, but she's probably and rightly still trying to avoid comparisons to Billie Holiday, whose voice her own strongly resembles.  She could probably also stand to live a little more on the bright side of life.  Her shabby chic voice would provide brighter material with depth.  She's clearly trying to find her own repertoire.  There are successes here and there.  She's still someone to follow.  She has a gift, she has a good ear for poetry.  It might help her to take herself a little more seriously each time, and stop futzing around.  Lay it down, girl, life is short.  Maybe spending some time in Moron de la Frontera would help.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I am a fan of Pride and Prejudice and have been since high school.  I got a copy of the A&E version of the movie for my birthday and loved it.  This one is really amazing, concidering it had to condense everything down from 5 hours.  It's got excellent tension and you love the characters.  I love it and it is a quick alternative to the longer version.
B000EHSVQE|5.0|Wow! I had no idea that people could be so close-minded and prejudiced--and about a movie for crying out loud! I mean people on here are saying that they would never date a person just because he/she liked this movie. And this from a reviewer who called this movie racist--talk about hypocrite! <br /> <br />Quite frankly, I thought this movie was hilarious. The acting is supposed to be life-less. The movie is supposed to be uneventful. But if you pay attention to the nuances, the slight glances, you might understand a bit more. For instance, when Napoleon is carrying the chickens to their new cages and he puts them in, he does so with the utmost care and then, he looks around at the chaos and filth that these chickens are forced to live and runs from the coop at top speed. For all the dirt and aggravation of working on the chicken farm he gets paid $1 an hour. Now who can't think of other people in our country who have to deal with that in a real-life scenario? <br /> <br />I am not going to get philosophical about the themes of this movie because in my opinion you either get this movie or you don't, either you are a literal or figurative thinker, either you can enjoy things that have a circular pattern or you are more linear. The point is you don't HAVE to like this movie. No one is forcing you to jump up and down with glee! You also don't need to be so spiteful to those of us who do like it. Liking this movie does not mean I don't like other more classic/mainstream comedies. Young Frankenstein, The Birdcage, The Producers, The Wedding Singer etc are all great movies and great comedies. Napoleon Dynamite is just one more that SOME people in enjoy. So lighten up!

B000B8IA2G|5.0|This is great science fiction and I agree with all of the positive reasons written here.  The cast is absolutely magical with an international quality that adds depth to the drama that unfolds.  Torri Higginson is perfect in the role as Dr. Weir and to think further on this.......I don't see any weak characters in this highly interactive lineup.  The development of Dr. Beckett from a background role to one of the front core characters was a good move by the executives of the show.  Another big plus in Stargate Atlantis is the fabulous Bridge Studios facility in the Vancouver area and the wonderful forest backdrops.  Southwest Canada is perfect for science fiction shows like this.  This is a DVD set for all SciFi fans.
B000ETQR3Q|4.0|I am a 17 year old paintball airsoft enthusiast. Nerf is the next best thing to practice with in the house. I am in high school and i love to play with nerf guns. I got this gun on 11/7/06. It is great. The only problem is the pistol extention. It sucks. Do not use it for the main gun. Just use it as a pistol it goes the same distance and is silent. The scope is crap. Get rid of it. It moves and is never accurate. If you shot with the extention and use the scope you will shot the ground not the intended target. If you just use the extention you have to aim up. Just use the main gun. It works wonders. the clip runs smoothly and does not jam as much. You can reload faster than any gun i have used. The bi-pod is ok. All nerf has to do is come out with extra clips and ammo to buy and they will be golden. My friends, brother and I all play nerf in a huge around the house tournament. I totally reccommend this gun. Maybe you will have your own tournament. Have fun and dont shoot your eye out.

The extras on the Lost Season 1 were much better, this one almost seemed like they knew people would buy it, so they didn't need to put much effort into it. <br /> <br />The packaging is a pain too (since you have to unfold the whole thing to access all the CDs and there are overlapping discs so you have to pull one out to get to the next, but it's all just minor things.
