0316166685|5.0|I came across this book at my parents' house when I was there for Sunday dinner sometime last year. I only intended to read the first few pages, to get a feel for whether or not I wanted to borrow the book when Mom was done reading it ... but I couldn't put it down! I ended up taking the book home with me that night and staying up til I had read the whole thing. I simply couldn't leave the story untold.<br /><br />Excellent read. Opens your imagination to the possibilities of what *might* be ...
0143038419|5.0|This book is one of the best books I have ever read, bar none.  \\"Eat, Pray, Love...\\" is filled with poignant moments, tinged with good humor and wisdom.  Yes, I laughed and cried while I read this book.  The author is a brave woman indeed, having bared her soul both in the experience and in her writing.  Liz Gilbert is relatable to any woman, in my opinion, and highly inspiring in her quest for meaning.  It doesn't hurt that she's a very gifted, poetic writer, either.
0316010669|5.0|I enjoyed this book much more than Gladwell's [[ASIN:0316346624 The Tipping Point]] (which I rate a 4 out of 5). Gladwell presents in [[ASIN:0316010669 Blink]] some wonderful insight into our ability (and in some of us our super-ability) to intake lots of information, assess and analyze it, and come to some final decision literally in the blink of an eye.     I've personally been interested in the topic of intuition and how we might be able to develop it as a skill. Gladwell's work has enabled me to further my understanding of intuition tremendously. He gives many examples and provides a lot of scientific explanation of how it works, or at least how it might work.    Gladwell also provides several case studies in a variety of areas ranging from assessment of rare antique art to predicting divorce in married couples. For the case studies alone Blink is worth the price of the book.    Best Of The Book: Gladwell's chapter on \\"Listening with Your Eyes\\" and how we often allow non-pertinent factors, such as what we SEE, to be the deciding factor in major decisions. I particularly enjoyed his description of how Abbie Conant became First Trombone for The Munich Philharmonic Orchestra. `Course it's in the conclusion of the book and you really should read the earlier chapters so you get the full impact.    I recommend the book for anyone interested in how we can make snap decisions and, depending on our knowledge and expertise, often be correct.    I hope you enjoy [[ASIN:0316010669 Blink]].
0385486804|5.0|Trips like that always tend to be instructive. The lesson that Chris apparently learned was that there was a reason why people had left the wild in the first place. Great book. I hear the movie is good too.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|If you are into the old Formula 1 cars, this is a must have video. The director was way ahead of his times and the special effects rival any computer generated graphics of todays modern movies. A truly wonderful film about a long gone era.
B000UR9TRS|5.0|The movie gives a extended view of Zepplin music which we cant fish for on all the studio albums, this is a complete rundown on the Zepplin following, back in the 70's this was the midnight movie so Zepplin could show  there movie with certain guest only and you had to be there at midnight to enter the theatre. Those days are old and this brings it back, Zepplin powerful  full of adrenelin and hype to set off a rocket ship, one of my favorite movies of all time!
B000003TAR|5.0|In Utero is Nirvana's last studio album, and here they tried to get away from the polished sound, and  commercial success of Nevermind. This record is raw and reactionary. It seems like a lot of the songs are responses to what was going on in Kurt Cobain's life at the time, specifically songs like Rape Me and All Apologies. it's a great record  that contains some of Cobain's best songs; Heart-Shaped Box, Dumb, Pennyroyal Tea, and All Apologies. Listen to the lyrics, they are all brilliant.
0805079831|5.0|To truly understand the nation to which we pay taxes,the era in which we live and the damage we have wrought to millions around the world and to truly understand what happened in Iraq - this amazingly well researched book must be read by all Americans.  I consider it one of, if not the most important book of this decade.  Ed Mangiafico
B000001ELL|2.0|I love KISS and they shattered my rock and roll fantasy of them on this album...I HATE \\"I was made for loving you\\"...it is a disco sell out...they made up for this cruddy album with more rock but I still do not own this album because of the disco junk on it!
0743270754|5.0|TEAM OF RIVALS IS AN EXCELLENT REPRESENTATION OF LINCOLN'S CABINET WHICH WAS CURIOUSLY MADE OF FOUR POLITICAL OPPONENTS AND THREE PARTISAN MEMBERS. DORIS KEARNS GODWIN, WELL KNOWN HISTORIAN, DESCRIBES THEIR BACKGROUNDS AND THEIR POLITICAL DIFFERENCES WHICH INVITES THE READER INTO THEIR CHARACTERS, POLICIES AND BACKGROUNDS.  IT IS A NEW VIEW OF LINCOLN, AS WELL AS, HIS CABINET. IT IS SO INTERESTING THAT ALTHOUGH LONG, YOU WON'T WANT TO PUT IT DOWN.
0743289684|5.0|I love this book.  This amazing lady chronicals a life which is representative of a culture that most Westerners know nothing about and consequently fear.  It is an intimate insiders view of what its like to grow up as a girl in the Muslim world.  To me it made absolutly clear why militant Muslims are the way they are and how we can have compassion for a group of people who seem to hate us.  It may even prompt some of us to scrutinize our own beliefs and prejudices.  She is a hero.
B000W8VY78|5.0|This box set has tracks that aren't available on the \\"Sawdust\\" compilation: \\"Somebody Told Me\\" (Josh Harris Remix), \\"Why Don't You Find Out For Yourself\\" (Morrissey cover!), \\"Smile Like You Mean It\\" (Acoustic Version), & \\"Get Trashed\\". Plus it's got amazingly cool, well-designed glossy 7\\" singles, each with completely different cover image and corresponding color scheme. Very cool!
B000SZLSB2|3.0|I did not think that James Blunt's second effort was nearly as powerful or riveting as his first. Although it was a decent project, it lacked the emotion of his prior cd. I only listened to it once in my car cd player. (I usually give the album a second time to decide if I like it.)  Again, it was not bad, just not as good as I had hoped.  1973 was the lone highlite!!
B0000041TD|5.0|This is one of the best opera recordings ever produced. For more than a decade, Freni-Pavarotti ruled the interpretation of Mim&igrave; and Rodolfo of this opera. This is absolutely the best La Boh&egrave;me recording available, although some may argue that sometimes Karajan's tempi may be a little bit slow. But Karajan shows his meticulosity in this recording by showing all the poetry and dramatical concept of this opera. The orchestra just sounds perfect, and the singers Freni, Pavarotti and Panerai are exactly Mim&igrave;, Rodolfo and Marcello. The combination between Freni and Pavarotti, the way they merge they voices together, is absolutely magic and essential for the results of this recording, because they have the adequate voices for both roles. Panerai sings the nicer Marcello of all, and Ghiaurov nails his Colline role, while Harwood delivers another great role as Musetta, despite her lack of perfect Italian, but with a lot of expressiveness.<br />Bottomline: this is the best La Boh&egrave;me available, and it is a must in any opera discography. Thanks for reading!<br />P.S. If you find my review helpful, vote YES (It does not mean you agree. It just means you found it helpful). You can read all my other reviews if you wish to. I modestly write them to help people form an opinion about movies, music and books, but if nobody reads them (if you don't vote I do not know if you did) there is no point in writing them.
0761145613|4.0|I don't usually review, but I've purchased this calendar for at least the past 3 years and I love it. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because I'm not a mom and I wish there were an alternate setup. However, I do like the calendar being columnar rather than typical boxy. I can fit more events in. Boynton is the best.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|i have really enjoyed this movie.  It will become one of my new favorite Christmas classics.
B00005JOHC|5.0|Great DVD - I missed most of the first season - hadn't been watching until a friend got me hooked on the show - great to see all I missed.  These guys are just the funniest - great chemistry with all the characters on the show.  Can't wait for season 2 to be available!
B00005JP5P|2.0|I like good sci-fi films, of which this is not one. I found it vague, incoherent and in places rather silly. Moreover, I found it uninvolving, in that I really couldn't care less about the fate of the astronauts. It has some nice FX, but, as in \\"Star Wars\\" I-III, all the FX in the world can only make a poor film more visually impressive. There needs to be more. There wasn't.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|This \\"documentary\\" is nothing more than a man giving his point of view on a highly debated issue.  The problem here is that it is completely one sided, thus making this not a documentary at all, but rather propaganda.  True documentaries are non-biased.    As for the subject matter, there are flaws throughout the film when concerned with accuracy.  And given that this is a man who does NOT practice what he preaches, then it's very difficult to take what he's saying seriously.  Plus there are way too many conflicting scientists who debate the validity of Human caused global warming.  Gore just writes the opponents off and boldly states that his info is \\"fact\\".  Um, nothing is fact unless every scientist agrees to it.  This is all still in the hypothesis stage.
0972169504|5.0|I'm a PhD student AND this comic accurately portrays my life to a \\"T!\\"  Sadly....
B000002KDX|5.0|Hook laden guitar work, trippy lyrics, beautiful vocal harmonies. This record has it all. Despite alot of commercial success, America never got the respect. The first 3 albums (America, Homecoming, and Hat Trick) are acoustic rock masterpieces. Critics hated these guys and wrote them off as CSN ripoffs but the truth is nobody did this type of music better than America. Nobody.
B0000640VO|5.0|This movie was the inspiration for the Travelocity gnome and (my opinion) the TV show called Pushing Daisies. It is a French film about love and longing and philosophy with lots of voice-overs and it is impossible to describe except to say that it is \\"happening as though it were the here-and-now\\", so it's an existentialist and in-the-now sort of gestalt experience to watch this film. It presents a philosophy of life that I agree with, an in-the-moment sort of improvisation that recommends itself to me (and I recommend living in the moment as much as possible) but talks about consequences.<br /><br />This is also a very humorous and uplifting film, with lots of silly games being played by young and hormonally tricked out adults who are looking for love but are a little too introverted to be brave. The point of the film is that only the (eventually) brave ones find happiness. Taking chances is what life is all about...you only have one chance so you better take it soon!
B0000024YL|2.0|They completely screwed up \\"Homeward Bound\\". They don't tell you it's live.  As you know the music in live recordings are almost always altered in some way.
0743486285|5.0|In this wonderful yet horrifying memoir of the excesses of the rock n roll lifestyle, Nikki Sixx, the founder of the world's most notorious rock band (Motley Crue), goes into detail about the horrors of his drug abuse. I also recommend the soundtrack, also written by Sixx, which combined with the book, really show his artistic prowess. LONG LIVE THE CRUE!
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Wow, this has gotta be the best show on TV. I've been hanging out for this dvd and it was worth the wait. The best part for us in OZ is that it has extras. Jensen and Jarred give brilliant performances throughout the whole series with a fitting climax at the end. The extra's are terrific giving good detail into how each episode is made along with a hillarious gag reel which I can't stop watching. Here's wishing and hoping for a 4th series!!!
0967851408|3.0|Before ordering this book, I had already started reading the e-version, decided this book was worth reading, the system worth applying, and wanted a hard copy.     I bought this particular edition mainly because it featured a \\"Search Inside\\" and the publisher also produced a workbook.     Having received the book, I am disappointed with the small print and the binding of the book, which one has to flatten out completely, at the risk of having the pages get unstuck: the margins are too short.    The workbook is a much better publication, and though I have just received it, I would recommend that one uses both books from the start, if like me, one can only take so much theory, and would rather have some practical, personalised exercises (The Master Key System lays out an exercise each week, but the ones in the Workbook are more concrete.)     Wish I could extol the virtues of the \\"System\\", but I haven't gotten that far yet. I can only say that I have tried the Joseph Murphy method, and that only provided minor satisfaction. I would say, this system is probably more to the point.
B000R9J3XE|4.0|Finally this band releases a greatest hits album!!! Like many other bands, most of the CD's put out by Garbage have two, maybe even three good songs, and the rest of the songs are crap! Now that all of Garbage's hits are on a single CD, you don't have to blow all your dough buying all of the CD's just to have all the hits.    All of the bands top songs are on the first half of the CD, and the more obscure songs by the band are on the last half. All I got to say is, gimme about 30 or 40 minutes with Shirley Manson, and she'd be wanting to marry a brother!!! Damn she's fine!
0321344758|5.0|This book is excellent. It's very accessible and easy reading without being superficial. It's not a usability cookbook, it actually makes you understand its principles and gives you critical sense to analyze any website and see what's wrong (or right) with it.  I just couldn't find any negative points about the book.
B000000OUE|5.0|ANOTHER GOOD ONE.  LET'S JUST SAY THAT IF YOU NEED TO READ A REVIEW TO KNOW IF YOU SHOULD BUY A WHITE ZOMBIE CD THEN YOU HAVE BEEN MISSING OUT.
B000URDEB0|4.0|Es imposible escuchar este album sin imaginar como sonaria con la voz de Tarja, musicalmente es superior a Once, pero realmente esperaba mucho mas de su nueva cantante.Sin embargo hay estupendas canciones como sahara y en mi concepto la mejor del album Meadows of Heaven. si eres fanatico de nightwish te va a encantar, pero si eres fanatico de tarja , no se puede comparar con albumes anteriores.
B000R7HY0K|3.0|It appears that this film is the pinnacle of a \\"love it or hate it\\" movie. for gods sake look at the total reviews 70 some odd 5 sars and 66 1 stars. wow. well here is my take           I enjoyed it. now let me finnish before anyone starts complaining. i enjoyed it, however, it was probably the worst movie i have seen in a long time (and i have seen troll 2). here is what i mean. though i appreciate what this movie was suposed to be and i understand why it was the way it was all you people who gave it 5 stars have to admit that NOTHING HAPPENS FOR 45 minutes. i can watch that at home(and i often do witch was why i think i was able to stomach the begining of this movie). now after that 45 minutes waddles its bloated ego past the screen we get to see what this movie could have been. Kurt Russel in one of his better roles with a really nice car outfitted for stuntdriving and murder. that sounds cool right? if you said yes then you will probably be dissapointed with what happens next. more of nothing. granted this time it is a bit more interesting and the characters are acctualy likeable. this still takes longer than it should but at least it's tolerable. and then the best role ever gets his balls handed to him. i am mad.            i am a huge film buff and through my years i have seen some wierd movies (from beyond, versus, the great yokai war, blood thirst, the satanic rights of dracula ect.). i gave this movie 3 stars insead of 1 or 0 for 3 reasons. first, this was exactly what it was supposed to be. anyone who has seen old grindhouse movies can attest to the fact that more ften than not they were pretty bad, and this was pretty bad. secondly Kurt Russel, though underused, was really very good and the role was well written. third the cinamatography and directing was probably the best i have seen from QT yet. it was beautiful. now here are a couple reasons i gave it 3 stars instead of 5. first need i say it again? NOTHING HAPPENS FOR 45 MINUTES. second, i hated the characters in the first segment. now when i say hate right there i don't just mean a general dislike, i mean that if i acctualy knew these people i would go to any means to be as far away from them as possible. i would also like to punch them. third, such a good idea... such a good writer, directer, and cinematographer... such a terrible execution. and fourth, though i enjoyed it, i will never voluntarily see this movie again. i have seen it twice and that is enough for me.              its definatly a life experience, but one i would be carefull about recomending.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|I was kinda skeptical about music by Nikki Sixx and 2 other musicians i had never heard of but this cd is amazing.  It is very well written concept album that rivals Operation Mindcrime, (Mindcrime is one of my alltime fav cd's )  Don't expect any Girls Girls Girls sort of tunes.  This music is exceptionally well written and performed.  Great vocalist in James Michael, the guitarist, DJ Ashba does an incredible job of writing music to match the tone and mood of the lyrics.  All the way around an excellant cd that i listen to all the time (out of a collection of about 600 cd's)...  One of the themes throughout is \\"how the hell am i still alive?\\", Sixx  went through an incredible personal hell and has produced an incredible cd capturing the decline and hell of a heroin addict trying to kick the habit and stay alive.  I highly recommend it if you like well written, rockin, well thought out,  and emotion producing music ...
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|I don't need to mention anything about this movie. If you are reading this, you already know this is a great movie. All I can say is that my whole family enjoyed watching this movie again.    The extras are excellent. Though, the Mary Poppins \\"short movie\\" was average. I did enjoy seeing the red carpet arrivals when it was first released as well as a much older Dick Van Dyke trying to dance to the movie's signature tune.     If you do not own Mary Poppins on DVD, you should immediately buy this.
1401308201|5.0|I have seen the Broadway in Chicago production of WICKED twice, so far, and I had just heard of The Grimmerie so I knew I had to have the book. I am so glad I was able to find and order it online. It's actually a gift for my daughter, but I had to read it first! It has so much information in it that I didn't even expect to find! I really appreciate all the background on the musical plus all the photos; candid and otherwise. I recommend this to all the fans of WICKED;  past, present and future! Sincerely, D. Vandervort
B000P0J05G|2.0|I can only say I am happy I rented it first! This grainy, washed-out, scratch and pop infested theatrical version is the same cheap copy that hit DVD 10 years ago. It's no improvement over the standard DVD! Not only that, but with HD a theatrical / directors cut could have been on one disk, restored with ear-splitting sound. NOT HEAR!<br /><br />DO NOT BUY.<br /><br />WAIT UNTIL THEY RESTORE IT!
B00005JPMZ|1.0|TMNT was a horrible movie, because it was CGI and not live-action. My advice: buy the classic Ninja Turtles trilogy(live action)on DVD.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|I bought this CD about a week ago and have played it many times while driving in my car.  The more I play it, the more I like it.  The combination of social/political commentary with a catchy, upbeat pop sound on several of the songs reminds me of Born in the USA.  The political songs on the CD have been getting most of the attention from mainstream media, but the song I am most enjoying is \\"Girls in Their Summer Clothes\\" with its great storytelling and intriguing sound.  The songwriting overall is excellent: All of the songs have well developed imagery and are very evocative.  I see some reviewers are complaining about the sound quality being muddled, but I think the sound quality is fine. \\"Magic\\" has all the traditional Springsteen elements but is very accessible at the same time. It should appeal to the general music fan as well as the \\"hardcore\\" fans of the Boss.  Highly recommended.
0316067598|4.0|I found the book very interesting and gave great insight into what it takes to be a Navy Seal. Now I know why many people rate the Seals as the greatest fighting men in the world!       Unfortunately, there are too many expletives used in the narrative! I would not let my teenage children read this book nor would I recommend it for the school library.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|As of this edit, \\"Magic\\" is the #1 selling music item on Amazon, and of the reviews written, 4 & 5 starred reviews are dominant. The reasoning behind this is simple --this is a strong album.     I am a 28 year old who has listened to Bruce since \\"Tunnel of Love\\". Sure, I may have missed the \\"Glory Days\\", but I went back & found them. Ever since then I've found even the songs I discovered earliest speaking to me in a new way.    \\"Magic\\" has this same potential--and the potential to bring a whole new set of younger listeners (not necessarily just the whitebread listeners either) to Bruce's music & message.     You boomers--    some of you were undoubtedly listening to \\"Born to Run\\" when I was just a twinkle in my Momma's eye, and then \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" the day that I was born--    bounce between    being over-ecstatic that Bruce & the E Street band are back in full (see many of the five star reviews here--they don't even employ an iota of critical thinking-which I'm sure would give Bruce himself pause)    and then    being bent out of shape because Bruce is making you listen to his message, through distortion and \\"over-producing.\\"        As usual with Springsteen reviews, these are too simple--and too polarized.     I think the larger phenomenon here with the low reviews is that \\"diehard\\" Bruce fans are afraid of losing him, afraid he might be changing. Don't be so insecure. These are tough times and we need Bruce's words--all of us. If and when Bruce does go away, it will not be a personal tragedy for the diehards--it will be a sad day for all of us.    Generally, the 5-stars are written by those who are happy to hear from the Bruce they are nostalgic about.     For myself, I think that if people find they have to listen harder to the words on this album, it's an added bonus and makes the message that much stronger. It's ALWAYS good to hear what Bruce has to say and this is a time to listen, not lament about how the \\"Glory Days\\" have changed.
0743486285|5.0|I loved the book. I purchased it for my nephew thats fourteen years old. I wanted him to find out from somebody that has been through the drug scene. I told him that I do not want him doing the samething. He promised me after rerading the book that he would not. My sister was very happy also. Thank you.
1416914285|1.0|I would not recommend this book to anyone under 18, as it contains scenes of violence that to me are not appropriate for minors.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book to anyone 18 or over, as it contains at least twenty-five books' worth of cliches, catchphrases, and tired stereotypes and very little else. Claire appears to have a tin ear for dialogue and doesn't seem to be able to think of much on her own: almost every character in City of Bones is lifted straight out of the Star Wars and Harry Potter universes with only minor changes made.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book to anyone even as a joke. It is that mind-numbingly, gut-wrenchingly bad.<br /><br />\\"City of Bones\\" is yet another example of the truism that Everyone Can Get a Book Contract But You.
0060989157|5.0|I am not into any music really.  My favorite reading is autobiographies.  I am older than any of the authors of this book.  My daughter was cleaning her house and lent me this book to read.  I thought \\"oh sure, what do I want to read this for\\" but I took it anyway. That was less than a week ago.  Once I opened it I hated to put the book down.  I finished it last night and now wonder if there will ever be The Dirt II.
B000002TYK|2.0|Best of You is the hit song off the album.  Most of the songs on the album sound the same, especially the ones in the middle of the album.  It picks up near the end, but not enough to save the rest of the album.  If you are new to Foo Fighters, check out the Coulor and the Shape instead.
B0001WTWCO|5.0|Simply fantastic, flawless...this film is the ultimate love story...it has all the elements to become one of the best films of all times...Juliette Binoche is spectacular and the chemistry between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas leaves you spechless.  Recommended for mature audiences who admire passionate tales.
1932100660|5.0|The data and information were very convincing. They back up the claims made by Joel Fuhrman in his book \\"Eat to Live\\". I am rapidly losing my desire for meat and animal protein of any kind.
B0007XT87G|5.0|With over a 150 reviews already I'd always figured nothing else was necessary. But, I continue to encounter people every day who have never heard of Porcupine Tree and I'm amazed that this band isn't a LOT more popular!!<br /><br />The reason is quite simple - I think this is one of the best bands in the world right now and Steve Wilson is an enormously talented singer/guitarist/songwriter. I like most everything they have released but this is probably my single favorite Porcupine Tree CD overall.<br /><br />I've always liked the hard rockin' PT over the \\"Floydish\\" PT and with Halo, Open car, Shallow, Arriving Somewhere But Not Here and the magnificent title track; you can't go wrong with this CD!<br /><br />In addition to the quality of the songs, the production and sound of the CD is superb. This is truly a 5-star CD in every sense of the word!!<br /><br />This CD, along with In Absentia, Fear of a Blank Planet, Stupid Dream and Lightbulb Sun, should be in EVERY rock lover's collection! Just don't ask me to rank them, other than preferring Deadwing by the slimmest of hairs, there's a 4-way tie for 2nd!! So I strongly encourage anyone who likes good rock of any kind get all 5. And then, if you like what you hear, get more!!<br /><br />And, if you should get a chance to see them.....by all means DO!!
0451457994|5.0|This one will withstand the test of time, no doubt about it.  It is unquestionably the best science fiction novel of our time, and if you have not read it, you are in for a treat that you will savor time and again.  I will not rehash the plot here.  Suffice it to say that it is a grand exploration into the unknown with perils along the way.<br /><br />I used to toy with the idea of writing a science fiction novel, and I felt there were certain things that it had to accomplish: 1) it would have to expand mankind's place in the universe in a scientifically plausible manner, 2)it would have to take into consideration the known limitations to mankind's existence in space, and 3) it would have to give meaning to human existence or allow mankind to transcend not only their own temporal existence but also the impermanence of the universe itself.  After reading Arthur C Clarke's 2001 I realized that the book had already been written and it is a masterpiece.<br /><br />If you are a Sci Fi fan, do not let 2001 go unread.
B000NA2348|4.0|I'm not sure why anyone would have a problem with this surround mix.  It doesn't jump out at you like others I've heard (particularly on some of the Depeche Mode Special Editions), but it's perfectly adequate without distracting too much from the straightforward soul, rock and dance/disco sounds that Bowie explores on this album.  I completely disagree with what another reviewer wrote about the mix on Fame; that song is a real treat in surround.  It's no drastic reinvention or alteration - just Fame nicely spread across all 5 speakers in your surround setup like any fan would expect, and like any great song, it makes me want to crank the volume as much as possible even if it means pissing off the neighbors.  Thank god I'm not in an apartment.    That being said, as everyone knows Young Americans finds Bowie comfortably entering his blue-eyed soul period.  Back when it was released, this must have thrown everyone for a loop.  But looking back, consider this a warmup for what eventually would become the perfect distillation of Bowie's unique sound with funk and soul: Station to Station.  Young Americans isn't quite as good as that disc, but it certainly holds its own in the Bowie catalog.  There are no weak tracks here, and besides the obvious hits, check out Bowie's wild, soulful take on Lennon's Across the Universe (way better than it should be), as well as the great bonus cut It's Gonna Be Me.  The remastering does a nice job bringing out how tight the background singers and musicians were on all these tracks, which again shows new life in full suround on the bonus disc.  In an age where honing music to perfection is the norm, it's nice to hear the raw skill of these musicians and singers behind Bowie's impassioned vocals.    If anything, buy this set simply for the bonus videos.  Besides two excellent live performances, Young Americans and 1984, from the Dick Cavett show, you get a full one-on-one session between Cavett and Bowie.  Talk about intense - here's Bowie playing nervously with his cane, wiping his nose, and obviously a bit too young to take much of it too seriously.  Besides the apparent side effects of coke, he's as amused at our reactions to him as we are to his ever-changing personnas.  Frtunately, Cavett doesn't take him too seriously either, and the two strike a fun and easy rapport.  This is priceless stuff - with the only thing missing being a reunion between the two to offer some commentary.  Guess I can wish.    Let's hope this special edition is just the start of the entire Bowie catalog being released in this format.  I know Bowie fans have been inundated with rereleases and remasters, and it's gotten a bit ridiculous.  But if surround-sound, videos and vintage interviews are part of the offering, I'll sell my set of Virgin remasters and come along for the ride.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Here is the thing...I remember when I first heard this band, I was in Awe.  That being said, I personally love the fact that this album is a bit different.  If I want to hear Hybrid Theory or Meteora I will listen to them but if I want to hear Minutes to Midnight I now have that choice as well.  It is good to have such awesome choices from a kick a** band! I love every song on this album!  I think they are brilliant and can't wait to see them on tour, they are not sell outs as previous posts have said, come on have an open mind they are musicians!

B000P0I4O4|4.0|My wife and I really enjoyed this moive.  I'm sorry there's so many negative reviews.  Granted this isn't academy award material and probably similar to plots of several made for TV movies over the years, but, all in all it's a nice watch.  Freeman, as always, is definately worth enjoying and Cusack was above average.  These two characters as bookends to the story were quite enjoyable.  This is a nice adventure drama and well worth our two hour stint in front of the TV.
0722533942|1.0|Every page I read, I found myself shaking my head. Raising my eyebrows, tryingto speed read, hoping there woudl be some redeeming quality to this book. There was none. I was actually frustrated that I had wasted my time on this. He is no Salman Rushdie- but you might say that is because  the book is in translation. Well that would be incorrect Milan Kundera's books are a case in point. So then I found myself trying to justify the lack of engaging narrative or believable characters in this quite frankly rather boring book by saying his style is different and very simple. Like in The Alchemist. But in that book- even though it had ideas that refer to certain esoteric philosophies- they were stated in simple terms and in a highly engaging narrative. I have no clue what Coelho was doign in this book. But thing i felt throughout this book was disbelief that he could write something like this. Very disappointing.

0060558121|3.0|After reading Good Omens, I decided to look into other works by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett. American Gods seems to be high on many people's favourite books lists, so I borrowed it from a friend and read it.<br /><br />Shadow is an ex-con who just got out of prison on parole, newly released to the bleak news of his wife's death. On a plane trip home, he meets a strange man who calls himself Wednesday. Wednesday offers Shadow a job working for him, and Shadow accepts, only to learn that Wednesday is an old god (I won't say which one, but it ought to be relatively obvious) and that old gods still live throughout America. Therein lies the premise of American Gods: Gods are created from people's belief in them. When the immigrants came to America, they took their gods with them in their minds, but over time, those gods have been lost and forgotten, slipping into obscurity. Now, many gods have been reduced to living in poverty and working lousy jobs as grifters, prostitutes, and so forth. It turns out that Wednesday is on a mission to rally the old gods into going to war with the \\"new gods\\" of media, internet, roads, and other such modern concepts. This set-up leads to the novel's main conflict.<br /><br />Well, that's a fascinating premise, isn't it? The idea of gods being created from people's belief in them is certainly nothing new, but it's something I always enjoy seeing, and I love the notion of the immigrants bringing their deities over across the ocean, as well as the promising fight between the old gods and the new. Gaiman's ideas are loaded with potential for an exciting, intriguing, inventive story, and I do give him props for the creativity that went into American Gods. Unfortunately, I feel that some of this potential goes to waste, but I'll get to that in a moment. First, I want to extol the good in this novel, because there are good things aplenty about it. The premise, as stated before, is inventive. Various gods from various pantheons appear; it's apparent that Gaiman has done his research, and I applaud him for that. In between chapters, there are several \\"Coming to America\\" stories detailing the lives of several groups of immigrants before and after they arrive in America. I found these segments to be among the high-lights of the novel; reading them is akin to seeing someone else's life flash before your eyes. The story of Wututu and Agasu in particular is very poignant and moving.<br /><br />One can hardly doubt Gaiman's talents as a storyteller; American Gods is packed with bits of ideas which fly by with lightning speed. All throughout reading it, I had moments where I thought, \\"That was clever...\\" or \\"That was thought-provoking...\\" or \\"That was an interesting way of looking at something you see everyday in a new light...\\" One example I'll give here is the scene with the unnamed god (whom everyone forgets the identity of upon meeting him) in Las Vegas, in which an omniscient narrator theorizes that people gamble to lose money, not to win it. Gaiman has a vast imagination and reading this novel is sometimes like slipping on a pair of glasses that distort everything you see around you on a daily basis. By the end of the novel, you can look back at earlier events and see foreshadowing in moments where before you might have just seen an idle conversation or a passing instance of triviality. In the interest of keeping the spoilers as minimal or non-existent as possible within my review, I'll say only that several twists toward the end took me by surprise (though a couple really didn't), which I think is impressive because I'm usually pretty adept at spotting twists. At its heart, American Gods is largely a road trip novel, and it has lots of scenery to share with you. Some readers, undoubtedly, hate the road trip element of the novel, but I found it enjoyable to read about the different places the characters visit.<br /><br />Others have said that American Gods would be a good novel to re-read because of the twists that are revealed towards the end, and I agree with this assessment; it seems like the perfect fare for a re-read.<br /><br />So why, then, did I dock two stars? Well, I've said that there is plenty of imagination and creativity to be found here, and I stand by that. But, frustratingly, the novel never feels cohesive to me. It often seems as if many ideas and scenes are thrown at the pages and spliced together without really finding a unifying thread. The book feels packed, very packed, and not necessarily in a good way. It's like a tasty sandwich which is so stuffed that pieces of lettuce and slices of turkey meat are slipping out and dropping on the ground [silly metaphor, I know, but it conveys the idea]. Most of the characters don't feel very thoroughly developed to me. Gaiman paints them with thin brush strokes, defining each by a few distinctive qualities. The old gods sometimes seem a bit like caricatures and stereotypes, while the new gods are even worse; their feelings and their \\"side\\", such as it is, is hardly shown at all. So much is left ambiguous, merely hinted at, on both sides, such that it becomes hard to really care if the gods survive or not. Shadow is a very...difficult protagonist, for me. He's an extremely passive character who barely reacts to the most bizarre events conceivable. In some ways, I can understand why Gaiman needed a protagonist like this, because a more reactive character might have slowed down the plot by taking time to ponder over and express shock about the various insane happenings in the novel, and I can understand an author's need to spur the plot along. However, this doesn't work well for the long segments where Shadow is by himself or living a mundane life in between the visits from the gods. The book is even more concerned with Shadow's life and Shadow's adventures than it is with the showdown between the gods, and though he's a good, virtuous, honest protagonist, he's just so stoic that it's hard to care much about him. I found myself struggling through certain parts of this novel -- not because they were difficult to read; indeed, the prose is quite simple, but because I just couldn't muster the energy for an interest in many of Shadow's affairs.<br /><br />Lastly, the resolution for the \\"main plot\\" of this novel is very poor. Again, trying not to spoil any specifics here, but the conclusion is just extremely uninspiring and feels like a cop-out. The reader spends all this time watching Shadow wander about -- on the road, then with Jacquel and Ibis, then in Lakeside -- and nothing happens. Then, finally, towards the end, the book speeds up. Exciting things occur. Twists pop up. You think you're in for a real pay-off that will make all those long, slow sections worthwhile, but the pay-off fizzles out in the most unsatisfying way you can imagine. The sub-plots are wrapped up better than the main storyline. In fact, the Lakeside storyline is wrapped up very well and very efficiently, and its conclusion is probably the part of the novel I most enjoyed and the part I felt the most actual emotion over. Hinzelmann may have been the one character in American Gods I genuinely felt some kind of sympathy for.<br /><br />In conclusion: creative premise, many intriguing and insightful moments throughout; glimmers of promise, solid and subtle foreshadowing, twists, and plenty of aspects of good storytelling can be found here. But the characters could be deeper and more interesting, more whole, and the story feels like it has too many underdeveloped roots springing out from its base that simply go nowhere and mean nothing. Perhaps American Gods could benefit from being trimmed and tightened, or perhaps Gaiman should stick to smaller scale plotlines until he's better at resolving more \\"epic\\" ones. As I understand it, he was still fairly new at novel writing when American Gods was written; I am sure he'll continue to improve and write a more satisfying epic in the future.<br /><br />As an addendum: I'm not so sure why there are many reviews on here expressing surprise and disgust at the scenes of sexuality and violence in the novel. Is it because Good Omens is lighter (the Pratchett influence, surely), because American Gods is a fantasy novel and people associate fantasy with levity, or...what, exactly? There are a few scenes of sexuality and violence, yes, but I wouldn't say Gaiman goes into any of the most graphic and unpleasant details. The novel skims them and describes them in a passing, casual fashion. Maybe I'm just more jaded than I've realized I am, but I would say the swearing, sex, and violence here are quite light in comparison to some novels and no worse (in fact, not as strong) as your average King or Barker fare. I was at no point shocked or disturbed. I think Gaiman writes these things in a manner that should make them palatable to the most mainstream audience possible, given the subject matter.certain parts of this novel -- not because they were difficult to read; indeed, the prose is quite simple, but because I just couldn't muster the energy for an interest in many of Shadow's affairs.

0743289684|5.0|Don't miss this book!<br /><br />In today's world a solid understanding of Islam is essential.  Many people claim that Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance.  Ms. Ali makes it clear that nothing could be farther from the truth. This has always been true in Islam.  For more on this, I would suggest the book \\"Why I Am Not a Muslim\\" by Ibn Warraq, which describes the miserable fates of both Islamic heretics and non-Muslims in Islamic countries since the time of Muhammad.  [[ASIN:1591020115 Why I Am Not a Muslim]]<br /><br />In the West we take it for granted that religion is largely a personal matter.  This is a relatively recent development, even in Europe. Not too many centuries ago whether or not you were Catholic or Protestant was a life or death matter in the West.  Wars were fought over it, with huge death tolls.  The idea of secularism and religious freedom came about not because people wanted religious disunity, but because the wars were inconclusive and people got tired of killing each other over something that could never be proven.  No matter how many people you kill, you can never achieve agreement on religion, because the main differences between one religion and another are in the supernatural realm. Is Heaven populated by Catholics? Protestants?  Someone else?  How can we ever know?<br /><br />The Muslim world has never made this transition. They really believe that conversion to Islam--by force if necessary--is the best hope for mankind.  These people are not playing games.  To Islamic countries, the whole concept of tolerance is nothing more than a sign of weakness.<br /><br />Ms. Ali fails to draw some conclusions that I think are obvious from her story.  In my opinion, the Western world needs to think very seriously about blocking further immigration from Islamic countries.  This is a matter of some urgency.  Many Islamic nations are already falling apart, the result of poor government, exploding populations, and environmental degradation.  This trend is likely to accelerate with the passing of Hubbert's oil peak.  For Western countries to accept large numbers of Muslim refugees in such times amounts to harboring a fifth column.  It is cultural suicide.te with the passing of Hubbert's oil peak.  For Western countries to accept large numbers of Muslim refugees in such times amounts to harboring a fifth column.

1594200823|5.0|This book will change the way you think about what you eat. And not just in terms of your own individual health/nutrition/monetary cost but also in an increased awareness of the larger ramifications of those choices. Pollan gets the reader really thinking about where our food - animal, vegetable and \\"other\\" comes from. Did you know how amazingly pervasive corn is?  Do we really need to be eating bread that's loaded with high fructose corn syrup? I'm not a vegetarian and don't plan to become one, but do animals really need to be subjected to nightmarish conditions and given food they were never intended by nature to consume? Why should you care how a steer lives before it ends up on your plate?  Because how an animal lives, how it is slaughtered and how it goes through the process to end up in that neat plastic package in the meat department has a direct effect on your health, that's why. You'll never look at the products lining the aisles of your local supermarket the same way again.

B0009IOR6Q|5.0|John Waters may not be everyone's cup of tea but he's a genius when it comes to making movies. No one makes them quite like him and no one ever will. There's one thing about his movies though -- they can't, and SHOULDN'T, be remade, this one included.<br /><br />Basically it's one of those dumb musicals that you can't help but like because the music is good and the actors are wonderful -- even if their acting in the movie is bad. It's set in the 1950s in Baltimore, which is funny onto itself. The grandmother is dumb and funny, the girl is a slut in the making, the boy's a bad one and there's the obligatory slutty woman trying to steal our girl's guy who ends up with the lead girl's straight edge boy toy. What more could you want to make this funnier? The acting is bad but you laugh anyways because it adds to the charm. The music is wonderful, even if sometimes questionable. The clothes are pretty accurate and the lingo is just catchy, makes you want to start saying it. (Plus there's that scene with Johnny in his whitey tighties, sure to get every teeny boppers heart throbbing.)<br /><br />Now, some of you might think it's too weird for you and that's okay, but for everyone who hasn't seen it and likes Johnny Depp, rent it at least to see if you will like it or not.
B00005JPRD|5.0|Everyone from U2's drummer, Larry Mullen, Jr. to the person on the street knows about the universality of The Beatles' music.  `Across the Universe' works very well using a sketchy story that shows the effect of their music on people's lives.  Not entirely detached from the everyday person presented in films like 'Forrest Gump,' the film manages to mix the mundane with an extraordinary inner voyage.  Love and music have provided people transcendence for centuries.  What makes 'Across the Universe' distinctive is its ability to contrast typical lives as they are transformed, especially here by the Beatles.      A song can paint a thousand pictures.  \\"Hey Jude\\" is Paul McCartney's lyrical masterpiece about seeking consolation during painful transitions in life.  It may be about Jane Asher or Julian Lennon to him, but the way it's created makes it a lyrical goldmine for everyone.  That's why any film that manages to venture into a voyage using The Beatles' music could easily become a disaster.   (Even the Beatles' own `Magical Mystery Tour' has been rendered flawed at best.)  After seeing this movie, I wondered why no one thought of it earlier.  Much of this vision couldn't have been conceived without digital enhancement, but even then, no outing bereft of imagination can be launched at all.      To me 'Across the Universe' succeeds where an admirable attempt of, say 'Tommy', fails.   First of all, fluidity is present.  It is a musical first and foremost, and the \\"ordinary people\\" who sing give us admirable, heartfelt performances, making their transformation tangible and audible.   The choreography and computer graphics put on a real show--only occasionally veering close to being stiff or maudlin.  It is also well-rounded, bringing the Peace Movement (with all its attendant flaws), the Black Movement, and the Generation Gap in ways that preserve the music's integrity and universality.  There's a story molded by the music, not the other way around.  Some of the songs selected were huge hits; others were obscure masterpieces.  It seldom feels forced.     There's also the risk of becoming clichéd.  All of the characters in the movie have Beatle names delivered in a natural way.  There's the protagonist, Jude (Jim Sturgess); his love interest, Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood); a sexy, siren landlady, Sadie (Dina Fuchs); her lover and bandmate, JoJo (Martin Luther McCoy) and Prudence (T.V. Carpio), a lesbian companion who catches up to them.  We meet all sorts of characters along the way, including the Psychedelic companions Dr. Robert (Bono) and Mr. Kite (Eddie Izzard).        My first objection to the film was seeing the bleak landscapes.  Jude is from Liverpool, and all of the friends end up together in New York (significantly John Lennon's major digs)  where the landscape is quite bleak.  There are factories belching out pollution, boxy city dwellings with dreary views, and a dingy laundromat and a bowling ally.  But this is really the point.  Whenever people break out into song, they are brimming with falling in love, expressing outrage at injustice, and reeling with the joys of music and alternative consciousness.  Although some of the nightmares of drug use aren't presented with the dreams, the flow of these dreamscapes is stunning.  In contrast the horrors of reality are presented:  of separation, of war, of death, of addiction.   Each shows the universal need for escape and some solace.  What keeps people humming in life more than a landscape of Beatles' music?            There may be objections that the movie never really ends.  It is, in a way, a never-ending story.  But the film does end properly enough with a focal point, one that needs little explanation or apology.  'Across the Universe' may not be everyone's vision, but it is a wonderful vision extremely well done.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Bruce Springsteen reunites with the E Street Band for the first time since The Rising in 2002 for Magic.  The title is appropriate as this album is a magical ride.  The sound harkens back to Mr. Springsteen's 70's and 80's glory days.  The music has a bright, sunny sound, calling to mind the wall of sound style orchestration he created for Born To Run.  But like much of his music, sounds can be deceiving.  The lively sound masks a deep, dark core where Mr. Springsteen explores the American dream and ideals being stripped away.  \\"Livin' In The Future\\" has a bouncy sound with some punchy sax work from Clarence Clemons, swirling organ play from Danny Federici and a sing along na-na ending but is about how basic American rights are being circumnavigated by the government.  \\"Devil's Arcade\\" has a mournful Suzy Tyrell violin piercing throughout with a stinging guitar solo and pounding drums at the end and tells about a soldier's tale and life and death. \\"Last To Die\\" questions how much longer will the war in Iraq wage on and who will be the last American soldier to die for the mistake of entering into the war.  The title track is a sparsely orchestrated song with eerie keyboards and echoed vocals that is sung from the point of view of an illusionist but is meant to be a warning against the government's slight of hand with the truth.  \\"Radio Nowhere\\" is the album opener and a call to arms for those who are true music fans and need to rise up and reclaim the airwaves and as guitar driven and hard rocking a song the band has recorded in years.  \\"You'll Be Coming Down\\" has a big sounding beat while \\"Girls In Their Summer Clothes\\" is a song about longing for something that is always just out of reach.  \\"Long Walk Home\\" was premiered on the Seeger Sessions tour but appears here in a truncated version with a different sound.  Lyrically reminiscent of \\"My Hometown\\", it tells the tale of a guy walking through the streets of the town he grew up in and soaking in all the things that have been a part of life and has excellent guitar work from Nils Lofgren.  \\"Your Own Worst Enemy\\" is the most densely orchestrated song on the album with a carnival sound and ending with church bells ringing.  \\"I'll Work For Your Love\\" is a classic Springsteen tale of a man professing his devotion to a woman and starts off with \\"Thunder Road\\" like piano sound from Roy Bittan and Mr. Springsteen gives his tenderest and sweetest sounding vocal on the album.  \\"Gypsy Biker\\" is the standout track on the album.  It opens with a strumming acoustic guitar and harmonica and tells the tale of a dead soldier being sent home from war.  It could be Vietnam, Iraq or any other war, but the narrator speaks of his undying love despite him just being dead and gone to those who sent him to fight and to those who blindly support the cause.  \\"Terry's Song\\" is an uncredited last track that was added late to album to eulogize the passing of Mr. Springsteen's long time friend and associate Terry McGovern.  The E Street Band is tight throughout the album with Garry Tallent & Max Weinberg providing a steady beat and Little Steven and Patti Scialfa providing strong harmonies.  Through the course of his illustrious career, Bruce Springsteen has shown the ability to make us think and remember the common man while never becoming sanctimonious and being highly entertaining.

0143038419|4.0|After reading all the negative reviews about this book, I'm a little surprised. I read the book after reading the reviews and was expecting the writer to be \\"self-centered\\" and \\"whiney\\" but found her to be none of the above. I found her story to be deeply personal, and one of internal growth, so of course she was self centered. But maybe we could substitute Self centered with a capital S, as in the search for the yogic Self. One of the better books I've read, I read it in one day.  As to the criticisms others wrote about not mentioning politics, or Indian poverty, or about the Indian portion of the book being \\"slow\\"...well if you read the book, she was in an ASHRAM. Slow? Yes. She didn't go travel India the way she did Italy and her portion on Italy DOES talk about poverty and politics quite a bit, as does the bit on Balinese culture in the last part of the book.  She does mention her divorce a lot, as accused by other reviews, but true to her word, she never really discusses the WHY of it all. She didn't say she wasn't going to talk about it at all, she said she wouldn't discuss the \\"why\\" of it all.  I found the book to be really really good. And I'm surprised to have read so many bad reviews on amazon. I'd be interested what they thought was a good book?

I get really peed off when someone like Rhonder Byrnes pretends to have found the secret, when I've been reading about this stuff for 20 years.  Some interesting bits but, the writing is too small to read and I have perfect eye sight.  Also, it does seem quite shallow.  I know of people who have just read it and they think it's going to really change their life.  But low and behold they have the same troubles and are in the same place where they started.  It's a quick fix and doesn't work for most people.  I want something that really works.
B000RF7XZI|4.0|I saw this movie a long time ago in the theatre with my wife and decided to pick it up when I heard there was a sequal coming, and I am not dissappointed with that decision.    The movie is really great, it has it all; murder, betrayal, empire, and Cate.  Elizabethan English History is not my strong point, and I'm sure that purest will wail about the mistakes, who cares, it does make for great drama.    The version I picked up was the HD-DVD version and that was also a smart idea because you can see the effort the director and the crew put into everything from the costumes to the props.  Everything is just beautiful, and the colours are amazing.    This ones a keeper.

Perfect. Just maybe too hard to get into.  4 - Good song, lacks a little bit but still pretty solid.  3 - Above average, but not worth listening to more than twice. In other words a filler.  2 - Boring, a waste of your listening time really.  1 - Barely listenable. This is gonna give you earache.    My personal favourite is Mysteria, although King of Fools is a very close second. The third best song isn't really set, although right now I'd probably go with Under the Moon.    The Report Card  _______________    1. Mysteria - 8 - One of the best songs of all time, and definetly my favourite opener. Heavy, great lyrics sounding strangely like the metal plague. Or maybe it's meant to be all about the fans?    Mysteria - The spirit arising  Eldritch cries from the hill  Mysteria - Fires are blazing  Their wicked feast is shattering the still - oh    And then the song goes into it's heavy guitar solo that you just can't forget.    2. The Piper Never Dies - 6 - This is gonna take a few listens before you fully get to appreciate this, but from start to finish this is a masterpiece. Also, if you love songs that are over 10 minutes long, clocking in at 10:07 this is going to be in your hall of fame.    3. We Don't Need A Hero - 5 - Not as memorable as other tracks, but definetly a great and solid song.     4. Down to the Devil - 6 - A piano intro is going to make you think this is a ballad, but it soon breaks out into a very heavy song, which is gonna get you headbanging to hell. Also, the chorus isgreat to sing along to.    5. King of Fools - 7 - My second favourite song. This is a single, so its   guaranteed to be more commercial and it certainly is the most commercial track of the first half of the album. Anyway, this is a classic headbanger that you have to play loud to fully appreciate it.    \\"You are the King of Fools\\"    6. Forever - 5/6 - Sorry but it's not quite good enough for a 6 but too good for a 5. This is a ballad, and Edguy have proved that they do ballads well. This is best listened to when you're desperately waiting for friends to come, or something like that.    7. Under the Moon - 6 - The heaviest track along with Mysteria, and a very memorable chorus this has got. You're gonna be singing the chorus over and over again for days.    Tracks after Under the Moon aren't as good, but still worth a listen.    8. Lavatory Love Machine - 4 - I can't believe this was released as a single. It's not a bad song, but there were so many better songs on here. (check out tracks 1-7) Also the lyrics are extremely bad.    9. Rise of the Morning Glory - 4 - More serious this time, but just too forgettable.     10. Lucifer in Love - 3 - Not a song, but this is a filler and not really worth a listen. They should have taken this off the record.    11. Navigator - 5 - At first this was my favourite, but now I've finally decided this wears off. Anyway, still a \\"fun to sing along\\" chorus.    12. The Spirit Will Remain - 4.5 - A ballad, not as strong as Forever, but I like this as a closing track.     Other bands to try out:    Blind Guardian  HammerFall  Iron Maiden  Manowar  Sonata Arctica  Stratovarius    At first I couldn't figure out the BG connection at all but now I can. Remember Time Stands Still (At the Iron Hill)? Tracks like \\"Down to the Devil\\" and \\"Under the Moon\\" have those same memorable choruses.    Anyway, buy this at all cost, whether metalhead or not. If you love nu-metal, emo, or even worse, rap, then get this just to save yourself from doom.
B000AP04OM|4.0|I am committing a sin here by reviewing a version that I haven't seen, but I wanted to make a comment or two about the movie itself for the one or two people who might never have seen it.  It's hard to find fault with this movie; it's wonderful family entertainment and the music is unforgettable.  That's part of the problem; the music has been played so much that you might be sick and tired of the songs.  The one I never tire of is \\"Climb Every Mountain\\".  The biggest problem with the movie is that it isn't very accurate.  We all know that Hollywood takes liberties with the truth, sometimes to make a movie more interesting than what the truth might be.  What I don't understand is why they do it when the truth itself is probably just as interesting or even more interesting.  A couple of notable examples; the names of all the children were changed in the movie.  Why not keep the original names?  Secondly, contrary to the movie where the father was so opposed to his children singing in public, he actually encouraged it because they needed to sing to help support the family that had gotten into dire financial circumstances.  The movie makes it seem like they were wealthy all the way through until leaving Austria.  It seems to me that the TRUE story would have been more interesting than this highly fictionalized account.  I hope they remake this one day with a little more attention to facts.  And following up with how they succeeded in America and what they did would be a wonderful sequel.  This movie has been shown so many times on television and I have seen so often that I am sick of it.  My wife loves the movie and can watch it anytime.  It is on at least once a year, so why buy a copy?  It's a movie that won't go away any time soon.  A classic love story based on true events.  Just be warned that it takes a lot of liberties with the facts.  I am surprised that the real Maria Von Trapp gave this movie such a favorable nod.  The then fresh-faced Julie Andrews was certainly more attractive than the somewhat homely real Maria.
B000SZLSB2|5.0|I bought this album with out hearing any singles.  I based my purchase on his first, \\"Back to Bedlam.\\"  I have to say I love this album too!  This time there is more piano tracks then on the first.  I have always enjoyed his heart felt lyrics.  Blunt is good song writer by his way of touching on several areas of the human existance.  Some of his songs tell something we have all been through or know of a person that has experienced the same issue.    \\"1973\\" - This is my favorite song on the album.  I think it is one that can be (and is)played again and again.  \\"One of the Brightest Stars\\"   \\"I'll Take Everything\\"   \\"Same Mistake\\" - A track which has decent lyrics:     \\"I'm not calling for a second chance,   I'm screaming at the top of my voice,   Give me reason, but don't give me choice,   Cause I'll just make the same mistake again\\"     It tells a good story about his love and how he screwed up.    \\"Carry You Home\\"   \\"Give Me Some Love\\"   \\"I Really Want You\\"   \\"Shine On\\"   \\"Annie\\"   \\"I Can't Hear the Music\\"     If you have Back to Bedlam you will like/love All Lost Souls.  It is more of the same but different, if that makes any sense.  Good CD.    I have to agree with Victoria Newton of The Sun who called the CD cover the \\"best in years\\",The cover consists of hundreds of pictures of Blunt (from childhood to recent) which forms a photomosaic of his face.

B000000OAC|4.0|When Queen released this album Punk and New Wave were about to change the music that a generation of teenagers bought. So from the beginning this album was unlikely to be received as well as previous Queen albums - and it wasn't.<br /><br />Certainly there is nothing on this album that matches Bohemian Rhapsody from two years earlier. However, I prefer this album to \\"A Night At The Opera\\" over all. For me the anthemic qualities of \\"We are the Champions\\" and \\"Spread Your Wings\\", together with the stylistic variety of \\"Sleeping on the Sidewalk\\" (Rhythm and Blues) and \\"My Melancholy Blues\\" (Piano Ballad) is what made Queen such a great band. Sometimes its the little things on this album that I really like, such as Roger Taylors fabulous drum break at 2:48 near the end of \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\". If that isn't enough have a listen \\"Its Late\\". As the Amazon reviewer said this is the best track on the album. If I had to pick only one Queen track this would be it. Its over 6 minutes long but it has everything you'd expect from a great Queen track. The only quick way I can think of describing it is that they should have performed it at Live Aid - it would have fitted perfectly into the great set they did there.<br /><br />There are a few weak tracks in my view, hence only 4 stars, but overall this a better album than its given credit for. Any Queen fan will know this already, but for anybodyelse, apart from a compilation this is as a good a place to start if you're buying Queen for the first time.
0553328255|5.0|It is a very good idea to publish all Sherlock Holmes' adventures in a  single volume.  Everyone who likes to read about solving crime mysteries in Victorian  England will be delighted.  I strongly recommend this book.

B000V8I2QU|5.0|Politics aside, this is a great album and Bruce has shown again what a great musician he is. Whether or not you agree with his political views, this album rocks like classic Springsteen and the E Street Band is in top form. I have read reviews that said the production on this album is bad, I don't really notice any problems though. My only regret is that he didn't choose to make a concert stop in Dallas while touring this album because I would love to hear these songs in person.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I love this movie. Jane Eyre has always been a favorite book and the two leads, Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson, truly captured the spirit of Charlotte Bronte for me; both of them are masters at exhibiting a full range of emotions in a matter of seconds without saying a word. As has been noted in a number of other reviews, this version has no extras. However, on Oct 9, 2007, a new version was released under the title The Bronte Collection which includes: cast and crew interviews; deleted scenes; BBC trailers; and commentary for the first and last hours. See [[ASIN:B000S2B23E Masterpiece Theatre: The Bronte Collection]] Unfortunately, The Bronte Collection version does NOT include the photo gallery from the UK version. And perhaps even more unfortunately, I just learned today that a Dutch version of the movie has blooper outtakes for several scenes and they are wonderful to watch if you're a big fan. (Edited to emphasize: the Dutch version is Region 2, and it's an abridged version of the movie.) Guess I'll also have to buy some future \\"Ultimate Edition\\" or whatever nonsense the industry chooses to dribble out to the fans among us. But I wish all the extras had been included in the very first version, I think they sell more DVDs that way. Don't forget to check your PBS listings as it's supposed to be re-broadcast on TV starting December 2007--tell your friends!
B000P0J0G0|5.0|I'm so glad to see this get a release in the USA so that our cousins across the pond who maybe only know Hugh Laurie from House get to see what a brilliant comedian he is.    For longtime UK fans of Fry and Laurie like myself, it's a little suprising that Hugh ended up the household name in the States rather than Stephen Fry, who was seen as the real genius in that pairing. But it's not the first time that's happened  - exactly the same thing occured with the greatest comedy British double act of all time in Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. Cook was a comedy genius - probably the greatest comedian the UK has ever produced  -but it was Dudley who broke the USA bigtime and became a Hollywood star.    It's so great to see these hilariously inventive and funny sketches again - and I do hope Steve and Hugh get together again soon for some more inspired lunatic genius.

0465043577|5.0|I'm doing research for a lecture about non-normal distributions, difficulties in prediction, etc.  My colleague recommended The Black Swan, which he loved.  I was plodding through it with difficulty when I found this book.  Both are written by mathematical types, and both deal with the economics as the subject matter.  But this book is by the founder of fractal geometry, and is much more lively, informative, well-documented and fun to read than the Black Swan, IMHO.

Vocalist James Michael who is a producer who produced many artist such as Motley Crue, Alanis Morissette, Saliva, Scorpions and Meatloaf to name a few.  This is one amazing CD as Nikki speaks in between a few tracks as he reads from his diary.  Some of the standout songs are \\"Life Is Beautiful\\", \\"Pray For Me\\" \\"Girl With Golden Eyes\\" This CD is a favorite of mine. Sixx AM doesn't sound like any Motley Crue album. I would love to hear more from Sixx AM.
B000WSHF4E|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />\\"Elizabeth: The Golden Age\\" picks up pretty much where 1998's \\"Elizabeth\\" left off.  The time is 1588, a full thirty years into Elizabeth I's phenomenal reign as Queen of England.  On the continent, Europe is caught in the grip of a papal-decreed Holy War, while, in Britain, the Virgin Queen faces numerous threats to her throne and person from enemies both within her realm and without.  The latter include King Phillip of Spain, who views the Protestant Elizabeth as nothing less than the devil himself come in female guise to tear down the one true apostolic faith, while the former consist mainly of her own disgruntled citizens, loyal to the Catholic Scottish queen (and Elizabeth`s own cousin), Mary Stuart, currently being held prisoner for suspected acts of sedition against the Crown.<br /><br />Whereas the first \\"Elizabeth\\" was a remarkably dark and brooding study of the times in which it was set, this follow-up takes a much more feel-good approach to the era (despite the occasional torture sequence or the random tongue-removal or beheading).  Returning as director, Shekhar Kapur has mounted this film with an eye toward mass audience consumption, focusing far more on the rather jejune - and largely fictionalized - romantic escapades of the Queen and Sir Walter Raleigh, than on the far more intriguing sociopolitical issues of the time.  The scenes depicting this more or less \\"platonic\\" love affair are the most poorly written in the film, utilizing dialogue that ranges from the pedestrian and the pretentious to the downright laughable and silly.  Clive Owen certainly looks dashing enough as the legendary, cloak-dropping \\"pirate,\\" Sir Walter, but he plays him with such an Errol Flynn air and demeanor that he quickly reduces the character to a movie-swashbuckler anachronism.<br /><br />Cate Blanchett, who turned herself into a virtual household name with her star-turn in the earlier film, scores a similar triumph in \\"The Golden Age.\\"  She helps to humanize a figure who has all too often been encased in wax when presented on screen.  In an obvious effort to make her more \\"identifiable\\" to modern audiences, the writers, William Nicholson and Michael Hirst, may have erred in making her just a mite too petulant and petty at times, but Blanchet is scrupulously careful to avoid crossing the line into buffoonery at any point in the film.  This Elizabeth is definitely feeling the burdens of her position and she often finds herself caught between reveling in her position of authority and privilege and secretly desiring the unscrutinized life of the anonymous, \\"regular\\" commoner.  The always reliable Geoffrey Rush also returns as her now-aging advisor, Sir Francis Walsingham.<br /><br />Yet, for all its flaws, and despite its tendency to wander off into the realm of soap opera and melodrama a bit too often, \\"Elizabeth: The Golden Age\\" is still a fairly engrossing and entertaining piece of historical drama, and certainly nowhere near the unmitigated disaster many critics have accused it of being.  For despite the extreme elaborateness of its clothing and sets, the film never really devolves into a stagnant or stale costume drama, thanks, in large part, to the richness of Blanchett's performance and to the reasonably fast-paced nature of the narrative.  Lucky for the audience, Kapur keeps the movie going by never dwelling too long on any given scene (although I do wish that he had toned down the music a scosh).<br /><br />The first \\"Elizabeth\\" was a genuinely great film; yet, while this second installment may not be quite as \\"golden\\" as either its title or its pedigree might suggest, it's still hard to resist the lure of that Elizabethan magic.l too often been encased in wax when presented on screen.

B000P0J024|5.0|Volume 1 besides the hits we all heard has some great songs by Dylan like \\"Dirty World\\" and \\"Tweeter and The Monkey Man.\\" Roy's \\"Not Alone Any More\\" is one of my favorite tracks.  Volume One made this 5 Stars their 2nd CD seems more like extra tunes w/ some exceptions.  Volume 3 (there is no Volume 2), Roy has passed away before they started recording. \\"7 Deadly Sins\\" reminds me of an early Beatle's tune. To me it seems Dylan & Petty sang more on this CD than on Volume 1.   Unfortunately Volume 1 is the best material out of the 2.  The DVD has clips & interviews w/ the band well all except for Dylan. But it was interesting to hear how some of the songs were recorded. It good to know that Roy left out on top he deserves praises and respect.
B0000CDL93|2.0|During the speech that Jim Garisson, played by Kevin Costner, gives towards the end of this film, he quotes Adolf Hitler:  \\"The greater the lie, the more people who will believe it.\\"  I guess he had a point.  Recent polls show that almost 80% of the American people believe the story Oliver Stone puts forth in \\"JFK\\".  This is a film that even major conspiracy theorists such as Mark Lane consider preposterous.  Lie after lie, half-truth after half-truth and omission after omission pepper this film throughout. I won't list them all because they are legion but a little digging will turn them up.  Consider , for one, that the document signed by LBJ in which \\"lies the Vietnam war\\"  was actually a reiteration of JFK's removal of troops ordered in a previous document.   True story.  When JFK is shown saying that he believes that it is South Vietnam's war to win or lose, what is not shown is the rest of the interview where he says he believes it would be a mistake to leave Vietnam.  Minor stuff like that.    One interesting note,also.  During the aforementioned speech, Garrison says how JFK's body was removed from Dallas in a sinister way, spirited out on Air Force One where a rushed swearing-in takes place (complete with a photo of LBJ taking the oath with Jaqueline kennedy conveniently cropped out) and brought to DC where his brain can be lost and the cover-up perfected.  That would have to mean Bobby and Jackie Kennedy were involved, as they would have to be.  Mrs. Kennedy wanted out of Dallas quickly, with her husband.  Bobby involved even though he is eulogized later in the speech.  Is that really credible?  Let's not forget that Jackie had Kenny O'Donnell, personal friend and trusted aide of JFK, make sure JFK was removed from Dallas.  This is interesting as Kevin Costner played the sainted O'Donnell in the film \\"Thirteen Days\\".   This must have been a portrayal of O'Donnell before \\"they\\" got to him.    Well, I could go on, but I'm not convincing anyone on either sideof the issue to switch sides, so I'll just end by saying that I gave it two stars because it is a compelling, well-made and acted film, even though I think it is a load of bunk.
B000RO9PXC|5.0|W/ warts and all this 3 CD set consist of 2 shows in one night. The first show is on the1st CD and the 2nd show which was longer takes up 2 CDs. Now these shows had excerpts aired on other live CDs but now in it's entirety. Also it is known that Jim was pretty inebriated during the performances. But I did enjoy some of his rambling between songs and w/ the occasional forgotten lyrics it's just like being there. So Jim may be off a bit but the band is just as tight. I think this is what a true Doors concert would sound like unlike the live recordings today that are half if not all recorded in the studio. Just a great piece of history to enjoy.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Heath Ledger does an amazing transformation performance. He is so in character, you know who this guy is. You've seen him around on the American landscape. A very reserved, quiet young man raised in the back roads amongst pain and prejudice--a man who has gained strength simply by enduring while avoiding becoming another of the perpetrators--but that strength also clamps down around him and shuts him up. He is trapped in his strength and much of his energy is simpy spent on keeping his tightly knotted self-preservation intact.. Along comes Jack Twist.    That first sexual encounter really comes out of left field. There wasn't anything beforehand that suggested that we should expect it or that those kinds of feelings, whatever those feelings were supposed to be, were growing in these characters, and I'd say that was the film's one big flaw. There was no real sense of a romance brewing, nor even lust--at least, not in the Ennis character and only very faint hints in the Jack character. Perhaps that was Ang Lee's bowing down to the reality of what the mass audience would tolerate, or upon what the film studio would tolerate considering the financial risk. Or maybe it was simply that that particular kind of romance is such uncharted territory in a major motion picture that both the movie maker and the mass audience are at a complete loss to negotiate any conventional terms for portraying it. The shared visual lexicon in film simply doesn't have the conventions yet to portray this kind of \\"romance,\\" so only with baby steps, film by film, can the  journey into this territory begin. Female gay romance has been dealt with many more times than male gay romance in mainstream film. Actually, I can only think of one or two films before this one that has made the attempt.    What Lee uses is a mixture of passion and brutality to depict their early relationship, but does that actually reveal their deep affection? Under their circumstances, for these two characters, maybe it does.Maybe their interiors are so tightly bound up by exteriors of cultural and self-inflicted constrictions that only on the back of violence can the two interiors break through to each other. But to buy this first sex scene you'd almost have to buy into some kind of undetectable telepathy that's been going on between Ennis and Jack because you certainly don't see any real evidence of anything brewing at this level before the tent scene. And actually, the why's and wherefore's of the attraction are never really revealed in the film, especially for Ennis, and Ennis's later excitement at seeing Jack and then running headlong into passion with him also seemed out of character. He wasn't \\"queer,\\" he had said earlier.  What happened? The interiors of these homosexual feelings are not really explored at all. It all just happens. And as someone else has mentioned, that first sex scene does, in a way, reinforce stereotypes about gay sex, and also suggests that the situation is not unfamiliar to Ennis since he seems to know about, and  go right into, the expected action. This is strange since we're never given any suggestion of a history of previous gay encounters for Ennis. On the contrary, he's about to, matter-of-factly, marry a woman. There are moments in this tale, though, when you see it really is about love, just basic love--moments which may take non-gays (like myself) out of any prevailing prejudices for a few heartbeats and see that it truly is possible.    The level of drama in this film is exceptional. This is very sophisticated story telling using the film medium. Lee proves again his remarkable resourcefulness and ability to focus sharply on subject matter that one would not expect from someone from a completely different culture. The depiction of the west/midwest here is deep and very convincing. You would think this could only be the product of an American movie maker. There are microscopic provincial idiosyncrasies in this film that Lee shouldn't know anythingabout. Who is this guy, Ang Lee? How does he do it, time after time? How does this foreigner get it so right? I've been a big fan of his since \\"Eat, Drink, Man, Woman,\\" which I watched three times at the theater when it first came out. Little did I know then what a peculiar direction his career would go in after that.

076075084X|5.0|In researching whether or not this is \\"half a book\\" I found the following information:  Alcott wrote a second part, which was published in 1869. Both parts were called Little Women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. Part II picks up three years after the events in the last chapter of the first part Little Women (\\"Aunt March Settles The Question\\"). In 1880, the two parts were combined into one volume, and have been published as such in the United States ever since. In the UK, the second part was published under the title Good Wives, though Alcott had no part in the decision.<br /><br />So, I guess you could say this is half a book but only in the U.S.<br />I do have a problem with Amazon's search engine not being able to find this book. Maybe because they don't stock it?

It's just as incredible.  I don't understand all the backlash.    The Guitar work may not be as good as John Frusciante, but the CD as a whole works, and it works quite well actually.    Songs like Warped, Aeroplane, My Friends, and Coffee Shop are legendary.  But songs like Walkabout, Tearjerker, Shallow Be Thy Game, and Transcending shape this album up to be an excellent release.  It did take me a few listens to find the excellence in this release.  But it's definitely there.    You WILL like this album, unless you're an RHCP purist or Frusciante fanboy, you definitely WILL like this album.    Highly recommended.
B00005RHGK|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatre and was a bit let down by the ending, the whole movie was full of tension and some intense images, I loved the fact that the director decided to go with the brother-sister concept and not the worn out lovers, which would have meant an unnecessary sex scene somewhere along the line(sorry all you pervs). If you listen to the directors comments, he specifically says that he did not mean for anyone to know exactly what the creeper was, he´s not a demon or a gargoyle, he´s just something that likes to eat parts of you.  Now this may be thinking to hard about a trivial subject BUT if you´re into horror movies then you know that most of the modern day monsters are basically humans who have become immortal through their evil ways , example Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers etc etc, here we have a true supernatural being, bullets do bounce off him, you can drive over him 4 times and he keeps coming for you, with a creature like that, these circumstances are acceptable, within the movies universe.  I liked this movie a lot, and it´s part of my collection, it´s a refreshing take on the old boogey man tale.

B0009A40ES|5.0|Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a very successful NYC Wall-Street yuppie in the 80's, he's got a wealthy lifestyle, a great apartment, nice taste in music and a beautiful fiancee named Evelyn (Reese Weitherspoon). He seems like a perfect man for any woman but underneath that skin he is a vicious coldblooded murderer that loves taunting, raping and mutilating his victims especially keeping their bodies in the closet but how long can he bring back his sanity?<br /><br />A chilling and ultraviolent horror thriller based on a novel is quite an interesting and gory satire on yuppies in the 80's, there's quite a bit of sex such as the gorgeous Reese Weitherspoon half naked in one scene and of course graphic violence like nailgun massacres, chainsaw murders and that kind of thing. The film co-stars Jared Leto, Josh Lucas and William Defoe in fine acting roles in this picture, it's one of the best horror-thrillers of the 2000's and shouldn't be missed by any fan of the genre plus the soundtrack is great.<br /><br />This special edition DVD contains the unrated uncut version and remastered picture and sound with nifty extras like audio commentary, deleted scenes, \\"American Psycho: From Book to Screen\\" three part featurette, an Essay on the pornography of killing, TV Spots and Trailers, and \\"The 80's: Downtown\\" featurette about the 80's.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\"High Tension\\", \\"Maniac (1980)\\", \\"Driller Killer\\", \\"Saw Quadrilogy\\", \\"Psycho (1960)\\", \\"Psycho II\\", \\"Psycho III\\", \\"Psycho IV: The Beginning\\", \\"Hostel 1 & 2\\", \\"House of 1000 Corpses\\", \\"The Devil's Rejects\\", \\"Scarface (1983)\\", \\"The Burning\\", \\"Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer\\", \\"The Untold Story\\", \\"Misery\\", \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre series plus 2003 remake and The Beginning\\", \\"Office Space\\", \\"Vertigo\\", \\"Funny Games\\", \\"Black Christmas (1974)\\", \\"Silent Night Deadly Night\\", \\"The Shining\\", \\"Nightmare (a.k.a.

B000J3OTTQ|4.0|movies with song, rythem, and attitude, and a pinch of romance. damn, they hit the spot. a little of this and a little of that. all in one make for a good film no doubt. to sum it up, bad boy from the wrong side of the tracks meets the poor little rich girl. the only thing they have in common is their passion for dance. both worlds collide, crash, and they don't end up to bad. this movie just makes you want to get up and dance, you know. i know if you like to bust some moves you'll surely dig this one no doubt. it also runs deep and gives you some emotional stuff that some not so privaleged people have to go through sometimes. it gives you that point of view from both worlds where it isn't always puppies and candy kanes. anyway jenna dewan, damn that girl does here thing. she's an up and coming actress and she's doing a fine job for real. i like her, she gives you a good performance. as for channing tatum, well i what can i say, if you got it you got it right? he's a b-boy type, so he plays the part very nice. being from the hood and all that. their chemistry was so well on set, that they took it to the real world you know. good costars good movie.
B000URDEB0|3.0|This is the seventh Nightwish album I have purchased and although it is good it does not measure up to the others.  \\"Poet and the Pendulum\\" sounds most like the old Nightwish but Anette's voice has a difficult time doing it justice.  I could not help wondering how it would have sounded with Tarja doing the vocals.  The song that is most different from the previous albums is \\"Islander\\", a very well done sea chantey (sort of) and it is, surprisingly, one of my favorite tunes on the disc.  \\"Last of the Wilds\\" is a Celtic sounding instrumental - also, not much like previous Nightwish songs but again, very good.  Except for those three songs however, the album is something of a disappointment.  Everything else lacks anything to make it special, to make it, well NIGHTWISH.  Not that it's bad.  If you like pop symphonic metal, then this album may appeal to you.  But if you're looking for the old classical, orchestral, choral, and operatic metallic grandeur that was the old Nightwish, you won't find much of it here.
0670034711|1.0|I am in complete awe of Ms. Gilbert for not only convincing someone to pay her to travel for a year but also taking something that resembles a poorly-written teenage diary and making a best-seller out of it. I guess believing in yourself really does work.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I've loved Emmylou for a long time now, the whole family has. She's up there with Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash, one of those singers we want to hear sing all the time who can't be here personally. I first heard Emmylou at my girlfriend's house at least thirty-five years ago and never forgot the impression. You almost feel that these singers you love and play all the time are part of the molecular structure of your house and your life. These are like the hymns people used to sing on Sunday together and to themselves during the week in the days before electronics. However that may be, this collaboration with Mark Knopfler is terrific, there's not a bad track on the record and some are great- especially \\"This is Us\\", a great baby boomer generation song.<br /><br />Very well produced. Superb arrangements. Mark Knopfler is an excellent singing companion to the great, self-effacing but angelic Emmylou. There's a nice sexual balance to the whole thing.
B000001GQB|1.0|I have to confess that I did not buy this product from Amazon or from any retailer for that matter.<br /><br />As part of my research I listened to the entire CD from the library.<br /><br />I am not sure why people give this CD high ratings. This is the WORST PERFORMANCE of Mozart's symphonies that I have heard.<br /><br />I have been listening to Mozart for close to a decade and along with Beethoven is my favorite composer.<br /><br />My criticism of this CD is mainly that this is not the way Mozart's music is to be played. Mozart's music is supposed to be full of energy, dynamism and melody.<br /><br />I would direct you to either Mackerras or Neville Marriner.

B000OYC7A8|5.0|Th dexterity and musicianship of Gilmour's understated playing does not receive the attention it richly deserves.

B00000099Z|5.0|I found this album when I it first came out.  I initially \\"liked\\" it, I wanted it for the song on the radio, just like young kids who don't have a clue as to the meaning of the music they listen to.  Well, a few days meditating and concentrating on this music through headphones at school and on the bus etc. this album took my life over.  I began to understand the depth and complexities music can have.  I haven't had any CD hit me as hard since.  This album changed my life forever, and I still listen to it over a decade later.

0975991477|4.0|I ran a school of holistic health for eleven years in California. I was ecstatic to find this book. It validates my own theories that I have adopted over the years through studying holistic alternative medicine based on ancient knowledge. I have been able to overcome genectic patterns that many of my family members have accepted and embodied.     I also watched a video of Dr Lipton and find him and his work to be enlightening and highly empowering. My hat is off to Dr Lipton for taking a stand against modern prescription drug companies. These companies want us to buy into the germ theory and genetics and give our power away to drugs.     I offer retreats in Sedona, Arizona, and am a clinical hypnotherapist. Many people who visit and are on drugs for high blood pressure, depression, and other medications. I reccomend that they seek out naturopathic assistance to reclaim their health. Medications are not an answer and Dr Lipton supports that theory. His book is an excellent resource and guide to reclaim your health and build a new health beleif.     In all my years in the holistic health field (more than thirty) I have always found the body to be able to heal itself once you remove the beliefs blocking health.
B000H6SXMY|4.0|When I got this box set I was so excited and started watching it immediatly, but when I got to disc six at the end of one of the episodes my dvd player just stopped playing it. So I took the disc out and cleaned it, but it still would not play. So I just skipped it and went on, but when I got to disc nine, three of the episodes on the dics would not play. Then I thought that it was my dvd player, so I took it and tried to play them in the other two dvd players that I have in the house and they still would not work. So I called amazon and they sent me a new one, but those dvds were just the same as before. So I returned both of them and got my box set elsewhere.  The friends dvds are really great and I had fun watching what I did. This is a good product, especially for the money, as long as you get a good quality product.
061891868X|5.0|This is an excellently written book, very easy to read,and with only one typo that I noticed. It starts with an excellent overview of physics from a technical point of view, without getting too technical,but a good basic understanding of physics is really needed to grasp what he is writing about, and shows the authors grasp of the technical issues, and then gets into a philosophical view of the state of physics and science generally. As an interested observer of science I have certainly noticed the lack of really big discoveries in the last twenty years or so, and this book confirms my view. Also being more of a creative thinker,rather than a conformist, a 'seer' as the author describes it,I can totally relate to the problems faced by people seeking a career in science, and the need to conform to currently popular programs and research where economic imperitives take precedence over original thinking,or even fundamental work, and where universities operate to build an image to attract students based on hype over substance. Its what put me off a career in science, and a university education, as I'm not interested in doing what others want in return for money,career,etc. The authors comment about some of the best scientists of the past being wealthy enough to support themselves in doing as they pleased is a very important point in showing that creative people are wasted if forced to do the work others want done in order to survive. Which basically leaves only those who want to conform and have an easy life and easy career path, who want to be technical experts rather than big thinkers or explorers of new concepts. It excludes most risk takers and entrepreneurs from a career in science,as you would end up bitter and unsatisfied. This book really just confirmed alot of what I thought, what should be common sense. And it makes an important point that only a few people think creatively,so it would not cost alot to employ these people and take a risk on them, in the hope that long term they will produce big things, while delivering very little of measurable worth in the short term. The book also goes into the sociology of science and scientists. Something I realised along time ago to my suprise was that scientists suffer from all the normal human flaws of bias and blindness, tribalism,etc that average people do,and often end up in religious type devoutness to their beliefs or tribe. I would have thought science would not attract such people, but it does,as the authors experience shows in confirming what I beleived just from watching science shows on TV,etc. Science would be an excellent career if not for the fact it suffers from the same B.S. that afflicts most human organisations and puts people like myself right off getting involved at all. The author is smart enough to realise that science must attract talent and compete with others for it,and his criticisms are done out of love for science and physics,not hate. It is interesting to see how carefully he treads in crisicising others, which just goes to show how religion-like science had become, and how risky it is to be a heretic, which so goes against what science should stand for,like open debate, constant questioning of all beleifs,etc, when ego's start getting in the way you might as well do something else, as its no better than any other politics or belief system. If you care about science this book raises many important points ,although I suspect it will find an audience with those that sympathise with its views and have no effect on those that need to learn from it most,as they will have closed minds and take all criticism as an attack to be defended against.A very enjoyable read.hat long term they will produce big things, while delivering very little of measurable worth in the short term.

B000R8YC1I|5.0|Truly a classic among fantasy films.  I used to watch this movie all the time a child.  10 years later, it's still as good as ever.  Very good storyline, decent puppets (good for it's time, and definitely still watchable today), and cinematography to blow your mind.    Like I mentioned, a great story.  There are 3 main species in this film, even though a few others are shown.  The Gelflings (we only see 2, the main characters), the Skekcies (not sure how to spell that), and the Mystics.  The Mystics and the Skekcies used to be one, but then the Crystal gets cracked, a shard goes missing, and it becomes the dark crystal.  The species that once was becomes seperated into skekcies and mysics, and the skekcies are in charge of the castle the crystal is kept in.  Mystics get kicked out, and travel long and far to find a place of peace.  From there, the world starts to get a little messed up in various places, partly because creatures the skekcies send out wreck havoc, and practically the whole Gelfling species gets killed off.  One Gelfling gets adopted by the mystics, the other by these other small creatures.  One day, when the Gelfling grows up, the mystics sense that it's time to search for the crystal shard and restore the dark crystal to what it once was.  As the Gelfling searches for the shard, meets up with the other Gelfling, and searches some more, the mystics journey back to the castle.  If you want to know more about the rest of the story, you'll have to see the movie yourself.  It can't be missed.    Since it's very difficult to find such a great fantasy film, 5 stars all the way!
B000WZAE1I|5.0|When I first heard about this film, I had no knowledge of its source, Neil Gaiman's critically acclaimed, same titled work.  What drew me to it was its near perfect cast, headlined by the lovely Michelle Pfieffer and Claire Danes, with the ever present Robert DeNiro, who portrays a character new for him considering past performances.  Nonetheless, I thought that the film would be campy, pretentious, and overly glorified for its genre.  I have rarely been happy to be proven wrong.    The film was a great delight, capturing everything one expects to see in a fantasy film:  magic, both light and dark; with witches, pirates, princes, and of course, the damsel in distress.  It even includes a fair maidan pursued by a number of suitors, though she really only has her sight set on one suitor in particular.  Although the film does bring in all the elements that make fantasy what it is, it does however perform a task that is rare indeed.  The roles that some of the characters usually play have been reversed, where the princes are not dashing, but instead, they are self-serving, ambitious and power hungry.  The man that will save the damsel is not some popular royal figure with his sights set on being honorable and truly noble, but a young man who like everyone else in the world, seeks to discover whom he is and bring purpose to his life.  Granted, he does not set out on this journey in the right way, but ultimately, he does discover that even one who deems himself to be little important can find that very importance simply through the actions and decisions one makes in an single moment.  The fair maiden turns out not to be so fair, at least underneath in terms of inner beauty.  The damsel is not so distressed to where she even has a few devices in her arsenal as well.  A pirate proves that the ferocity, vulgarity, and dim-witted charm that make them appealing is not always found in every pirate.  Lastly, we finally have a villain that is in essence truly evil, exhibiting a chilling, frightening charm towards anyone who encounters her, hidden behind her striking beauty.    What makes the film work is not the special effects or the set design, costumes, or any other thing a standard movie critic is usually obsessed with, but the simple fact that \\"Stardust\\" is a film that does not take itself too seriously.  It is meant to purely entertain, which I feel it truly does.  The cast is in true comedic form.  Charlie Cox is convincing as Tristan, the often clueless and bumbling hero.  Claire Danes shines as Yvaine, the fallen star who is captivated by the human and magical world.  But it is Michelle Pfieffer and Robert DeNiro who steal the show as Lamia and Captain Shakespeare, respectively.  Pfieffer's Lamia spends the film in pursuit of her goal, tirelessly and cunningly scheming against Tristan and Yvaine, and demonstrates in several encounters with other characters, especially with the poor farmerboy and Ditchwater Sal, why she is one witch who should never be underestimated.  DeNiro's Capt. Shakespeare is appealing through his secret that defines in more ways than one the true meaning of paradox and irony.  All in all, the cast, especially Pfieffer and DeNiro, portray very memorable and charming characters.    Do not miss out on this rare gem of a comedy.  Even if you do not like it in its entirety, the film possesses many things that strike you as entertaining and memorable.  Do not deny yourself this gem.  I'm looking forward to it in High Definition.
B00006L90T|4.0|A ghost is a soul which doesn't realize it is dead, and that is what Mary Henry is in Carnival of Souls.  When she sees that she is invisible to others, Mary realizes that she's \\"not in this world.\\"  The creepy organ music is like something you hear in a silent horror movie,and the camera angles and b&w photography add to the eerie atmosphere of the film.  It's a psychological horror film with sexual overtones,like Psycho, and a precursor to Night of the Living Dead.  A true classic,not to be missed.
0765316889|4.0|I really enjoyed this second installment in Sanderson's Mistborn series. I thought that the story was told very well and that it was well developed. If you're a fan of well-written fantasy/sci-fi, I highly recommend the books of Brandon Sanderson.
1582701709|1.0|For a long time I've been toying with the idea of creating a website and book called \\"Wealth Without Skills\\" that promised to give away the true secret of achieving wealth beyond your wildest dreams (not seriously, but more as a kind of joke that I thought actually might make a lot of money if I did it right because a lot of worse products have been lucrative) .  I really DO know the secret, and so do the authors of this book.  Unfortunately for my bank account, I couldn't bring myself to actually sell this secret.  Rhonda Byrne, though, is obviously not bothered by such moral qualms.  Though she obscures the secret with religious and philosophical trappings, and combines it with the not-so-secret idea that positive thinking generally puts you in a better position to take advantage of life's opportunities, the essential core of the secret that she employed in writing this book and the secret I was going to sell are basically the same.  Here it is, I'll give you the secret for free.  The true, hidden and never-before-revealed secret to achieving wealth beyond your dreams without a whole lot of effort and without any real skills or actually useful product is just this: convince a lot of people that you have the secret that will allow them to achieve their dreams without a lot of effort but simply by wishing hard, and that you will sell this secret to them for a small fee.  If you can do that, you really can achieve wealth beyond your wildest dreams, as Rhonda Byrne illustrates here.  But in fact she has an even better secret on top of this one: if you can convince those same poor sops who shelled out a chunk of change to buy their secret that if they don't achieve insane wealth right away it was their fault because they didn't want it bad enough, then you really have a fool proof scheme, new clothes for the emperor.
B000URDEB0|5.0|This is by far the best Nightwish album to date! It starts with the Poet and the Pendulum - which draws you into the true musical talent and nature of the band and then every song after just draws you in deeper.    Indeed, Tarja was (emphasis on 'was') the inspiration for the band, but her parting was destiny - and opened the door for Anette - which I personally believe is the true vocal backbone Nightwish needed.     I've been a die-hard fan of Nightwish for years and have all of their albums. I've written other reviews of their former albums and am very excited to write a review on Dark Passion Play.    It is obvious that the band had this album done and prepped far before Anette was selected - after months of careful selection. It wasn't long after Anette joined that this masterpiece was released. All they needed was the perfect vocalist to add her part before they released it.     And what a perfect match she is for the band!    This is by far Nightwish's best. This is not merely an 'album'. It is a symphonic metal masterpiece.    I've said it before and I will reiterate - Nightwish is one of the most talented group of young musicians in the world today - and Dark Passion Play is proof of that.    B-R-A-V-O!!! I can't wait to see them in concert in November. The world will stop for one evening in Mesa, AZ!    Nightwish is the best of the best and I look forward to their future releases with Anette at the vocal helm.
B00003CXDV|5.0|Alan Rickman had me from the get-go. In Galaxy Quest, he plays a former legitimate-theatre actor who had the mixed blessing of playing a Mr. Spock-like character in a long-defunct \\"Star Trek\\"-like TV show. These days, he is reduced to appearances in full makeup and uniform at fan conventions and ribbon cutting ceremonies at local strip malls, and his anguish is a riot.(That's where the title of my review comes in. It's delivered by Rickman at a ribbon-cutting with such despair and distate, you find yourself laughing).<br /><br />This movie is hilarious. There are so many quotable lines, as I'm sure a lot of reviewers here have already indicated.<br /><br />Anyway, it turns out that there really are aliens out there, and they have caught every episode of the Galaxy Quest TV show and interpreted them as real-life occurences transmitted from Earth. Believing the Galaxy Quest cast to be real starship personnel, the aliens plead for their help.<br /><br />I won't say anything else, except that a catsuit and blonde wig is a very good look for Sigourney Weaver :)
0312954468|3.0|Well this book is OK.  I bought it due to others reviews.  My first and most important thing that I did not like was the fact that it was told in first person perspective by the slave Taita.  He was very annoying in the fact that he was a slave yet seemed be the smartest man in Egypt history.  He was the best at everything from medical situations to warfare to architecture.  The story of Lostris and Tanus was beautiful and fulfilling.  Yet it was stuck in the middle of a lot of other filler.  There were many times when the story teller sidetracked his main idea.  I would say to myself, what he is talking about, where is he going with this, and why is he talking about this.  I enjoy lots of dialog and this book has much much more just straight story description.  It was a good story and I'm glad I got through it.  But I'm not sure I want to read another book like this.
0385522401|5.0|\\"On Chesil Beach\\" is more a novella than a novel. It's also nothing like the similarly-titled \\"On the Beach\\" or \\"Beach Music\\".  McEwan tells the short, but intense story of a young British couple on their honeymoon in 1962. Both are virgins, but with very different attitudes about sex, and, in keeping with the times, utterly incapable of discussing the subject.<br /><br />With such a narrow scope, essentially the events of one evening of the couple's honeymoon, \\"On Chesil Beach\\" is necessarily intensely personal, sometimes uncomfortably so--even though we know that we're reading about fictional characters and the events of the story \\"happen\\" almost 50 years ago. Still in the retelling of those events, and of their consequences in the later lives of the characters, McEwan makes a very important point about dangers of miscommunication or worse, no communication, in relationships.<br /><br />Five stars for this short but powerful work, but for adult and near-adult readers only. The climactic scene isn't lascivious, but it is fairly graphic. Younger readers may also get bored by the British understatement and calm of the first half of the book.  I look forward to reading more of McEwan's novels.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|SICKO is an entertaining and eye opening documentary that maintains a sense of dry humor about our corrupt health care system.  We already pay for universal care here but don't receive it because over 30% of the health care dollar is diverted to things not related to treating people.<br />  HR 676 in the House of Representatives would create universal health care here and needs more cosponsors.  In California, there is SB 840 which would do the same in California.<br />  The leading cause of bankruptcies and foreclosures now is because people can't afford to pay their doctor's bills.  We have a system now in which insurance agents are more powerful than doctors and this needs to change.
B0000931QA|3.0|Everyone, especially QR fans, seem to get in a huff-and-puff over how awesome this album is. I'll admit its overall a good album with not much weak material at all. Yet when you take an objective look at it, what you have is a solid metal album that shows its age in production and songwriting (the stylistic equivalent of, say, Iron Maiden's Somewhere In Time, where certain songs can't help but give away that they're from the 80's). The storyline is intriguing enough, yet is hardly worth the hooplah the fans make it out to be, not to mention the philosophical reading-into it receives by armchair literary/political analysts on the internet, who give endless praise to and regarding the paranoid, often clumsy, cynical psuedo-political statements in the lyrics as deep and insightful truth.     I have no problem with concept albums, though I will avoid the unintentional insult that fans of this album give it by calling it a \\"Rock Opera\\"; to me, this is the most pompous, pretentious, idiotic thing to purposely try to create, for fans of rock music (of all genres) who deliberately want to be \\"high brow\\" and have a piece of \\"high art\\" to tout to other wanna-be snobs. Andrew Lloyd Webber, Queensryche ain't - and thank God for that.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Funny thing about this band. I actually bought several pre release copies of this disc from another site (The discs came with autographed liner notes by the band) I kept the autographs and gave the disc to some friends. To this day they still tell me it is the only music they listen to now. Since they liked it so much I went back and purchased some copies of One Day Remains, Second Skin (The Mayfield Four), and Fallout (The Mayfield Four) and plan to pass them out next.     There is no better gift than Great Rock and Roll. And you gotta love these guys for what they've given.    If what you've been missin' is Heritage Rock'n'Roll music in your life and you want to come back home, make a small investment here and become fulfilled once again.

B000KRN67C|5.0|Hail the Greeks from the heart of the Black Metal scene. Production is thick, sound is atmospheric (without keyboards). The oriental elements in the music is more visible. The song writing is excellent. Less black metal influences (but there are still)... And the riffs... Yes they are good. They have evolved over time, and this is a proof that they have the potential to write good LPs in the near future. A must buy if u are into metal (and I mean real metal of course)...
B000TEUCFA|5.0|Was browsing on iTunes WIFi in bed on my iPhone and came across Stacey Kent. Awesome!   I like her vocals and the jazzy styles. Bought the album right away via iPhone. Her style reminds me  a little of Katy Melua.
0618001905|5.0|Not since Joseph Conrad's \\"The Heart of Darkness\\" have we seen the cold-blooded truth about the cold-blooded atrocities that were all too commonplace during the era of \\"the white man's colonization of Africa.\\" Here \\"the art of despotism Western style\\" was perfected and perhaps reached its apotheosis through the evil but almost Teutonically calculated machinations of a petty and vile King of Belgium.<br /><br />Examined from inside the hermitically sealed inner chamber of horrors of a forgotten and almost unrecorded, and still seldom acknowledged 20th Century holocaust, the author lays bare -- atrocity-by-ugly-atrocity -- the moral and humanitarian horrors of the subjugation of the \\"Belgian Congo.\\" It is a crime of such monumental proportions that it will forever stain the character of the entire Belgian people.<br /><br />Yet, despite the fact that these horrors, in almost every respect rivaled the European holocaust committed against Jews and other \\"so called undesirables,\\" until this volume, the atrocities of the Belgium Congo had remained a carefully ignored and much repressed - if not subtly rationalized and protected part of Western history.<br /><br />Just as Hitler disguised the last train ride to Auschwitz as a vacation to an idyllic labor camp, so too did Leopold's henchmen -- which, as usual, included a sizable contingent of the Christian clergy - also disguised their perfidy under the cloak of \\"civilizing the barbaric Africans.\\" If it does nothing else, this book finally reveals who the real savages of Africa were.<br /><br />Adam Hochschild shakes the moral conscience in more than just one way: The key subtext of his book is that there is no final justice in this world. The strong, the greedy and the powerful continue to murder and otherwise ravage the earth with impunity; and then as King Leopold II did, they rewrite history to cover their crimes. Overtime, even those who know the truth are unable to come to grips with what they know and with what theyhave seen. In order to retain a modicum of their conscience intact, they learn that it is much healthier to pretend to forget. Otherwise, how else can they sit idly by and watch the dead rest peacefully, when the unremitting Christian-backed moral hell on earth continue to rage unabated above their heads?<br /><br />The other subtext is equally chilling: This revelation gives a whole new meaning to Rudyard Kipling's poem, or William Easterly's book of the same name: \\"The White Man's Burden.\\" It is that the white man's greed and crimes over the past half millennium -- in the Americas, against all of Africa and most of Asia - under the guise of doing good for the less civilized -- has bequeath to us all a moral \\"scorched earth.\\" All of humanity has been compromised and greatly diminished by the white man's rampant quest for his version of civilization and progress.<br /><br />Now, in the aftermath of the bloodiest century in history, it is not too much of an exaggeration to suggest that the white man's greed and immorality normalized under the guise of doing good for the less civilized has itself become a kind of global moral savagery that is now a burden for all the world.<br /><br />Five Stars
B000VKJ6VS|4.0|A big fan of Creed and same for Alter Bridge.It was good to see Tremonti come back with the boys with a follow-up to One Day Remains.Blackbird has the real good rockers and cool ballads. The standouts are: Come To Life,Coming Home,Rise Today,Watch Over You(my fave track on the album) and Break Me Down.A local record store has two bonus tracks,The Damage Done and New Way To Live.Don't know why they weren't included on all copies,but what the heck.If you liked the first Alter Bridge and was in question on purchasing this one,don't think anymore.Go out and get it now.The price is very good all over...It is well worth it.A solid 4.5 stars.Who's Scott Stapp???? LOL
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I saw this movie, checked the facts, read the critics (esp Crichton, whose work is quite a bit of trickery in the end), bought the DVD and then watched it again.  Except for a few simplifications, Gore's work--and that of the scientists whom he cites--is scientifically sound.  And, of course, you can check on it yourself too.  Read the scientists themselves (and don't trust those who quote the scientists, by the way, because, as Crichton does, writers may cherry-pick their figures and quote without context.)      Beyond this issue, the movie even manages to entertain, to be movING.  It's sad to read the one star reviews here that posit debunked alternatives and make political and personal attacks.  I say this as a former skeptic--as one who wants to hear the arguments from each side.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|Too keep it short,a real good album.For me,not as good as his last with E Street,\\"The Rising\\",but nonetheless good stuff.The standouts...Radio Nowhere,You'll Be Comin' Down,Your Own Worst Enemy,Girls In Their Summer Clothes and Last To Die. It follows the standard E Street,Bruce formula,which is always good.You like Bruce,which I'm sure you do,if you read this. Check it out..It is worth the buying.Solid 4 stars for me.Not quite a classic,but it will be remembered.
B00005NTJM|5.0|This Was has, over time become one of my favorite Tull albums.  Which seems a little strange because it doesn't really sound like the Tull we've come to know and love.  The core Tull sound is definitely there in a rudimentary sense, but it's far closer to the english-blues style of John Mayall or dare I say Cream.  That being said, Tull was no where near as good a blues band as either of those two bands, but they were still able to produce an album that is quite respectable.  Mick Abrahams is perhaps one of the more overlooked blues guitarists to come out of England.  Ian still works the flute with all the fervor and skill that we've come to know him for, and CLive Bunker and Glenn Cornick are a sound and solid rhythem section.  One notable differance in the album is Anderson's vocals. He tries to get a deeper, bluesier sound, but winds up producing this pleasant sort of croakey sound.  I'm not saying it's a bad thing, personally I kind of like it, but it is a bit of a change if your used to his later work.  Overall it's a bright and fairly upbeat album.  Perfect for summer days, but worth the price just about any time.
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|What a great gift from the fabulous Annie Lennox.  Yes, I wish she was more prolific, but every album is like a wonderful gift to her fans.  Dark Road hypnotized me when I first heard it and I could not wait for the rest of the CD.  I was not disappointed!  This is a wonderful set of new tunes covering a myriad of genres.  Fron the accordian (really cool) on Ghost in My Machine to the electronica on Coloured Bedspread this is a great album. I cannot recommend this enough.  Please Annie, don't wait so long before your next album!  See you at Symphony Hall!
B000TUXL2A|4.0|I was initially disappointed with this CD first couple of times through. It did not catch on right away as Shangri-La. After coming back to about a week later, I am really getting into it now. You begin to hear the small nuances and restrained guitar playing that makes this a real pleasure.    Knopfler has really grown as artist. When other old timers are just going through the motion, he has simply gotten better. I don't even listen to DS cds anymore. Except for the debut DS cd, the rest of the DS, espcially BIA, they sound very dated. Those frumpy synthesizers are ughhhhhh boring...
B000R4SMCW|1.0|This movie rolls along like molasses in January until it comes to one of the most ridiculous endings I have ever seen.  The acting is simply terrible.  Anthony Hopkins seems to be completely uninterested in his character.  Although it would be difficult for any actor to give this walking piece of cardboard any real-life emotions.  Ryan Gosling is a walking cliche.  He has chosen to portray his character's inner turmoil with gestures, and funny facial expressions.  The actual dialog he mutters is laughable both in content and delivery.  Again, there is no depth.      If you are looking for an interesting thriller which will keep you engaged and guessing until the end, this ain't it.
1582701709|1.0|If you bought this book, sorry that you threw away your money.  The whole point of the book is positive thinking and the power that it can have in your life.  That's all good, but there is major problems and dissapointments in the book.    True, nothing is better than feeling good and having a positive attitude, but this lady is nuts.  She wrote this book with the intention of stealing your money.  Everything in here is stuff you already know, minus the garbage she writes about not looking at fat people, her view on the atrocities in the world ( apparently everything happens because you weren't thinking right! ), and the ridiculous notion that if you want money, all you have to do is expect checks in the mailbox and pretend that your bills are checks ( is she serious?)    yeah, lady, I'm going to pretend my bills are checks, and then I'm going to pretend that my poop is gold, and take it to the jeweler.  Get REAL!! Anyone that takes this book to heart is gullible and impressionable to the maximum.    Just think, if you buy this book, you can walk out of your house thinking that people in wheelchairs caused their disabilities themselves, because of their negative thoughts!!  Idiotic... Don't buy.  It's ok in some ways for motivation to be happy, but there are much better ways to lift your spirits than to listen to this trash.  The writer composed this book on a whole lot of mushrooms and ecstasy, and I have a feeling it burned gigantic holes in her brain that will never replenish.  I hope she doesn't write another book,   seriously.
B0002KVULG|5.0|I was in the audience to watch the stage & film versions of Dracula, Frank Langella has duplicated his role on film, there was nothing that can tell you how appealing to the audienece this role was played, and to signify this, was to watch the Ladies in the audience litterally pull down their collars and show their want for Dracula to bite them. His elegant moves upon the stage and his eyes, voice and mannerism gave Dracula a New Look a Much Better look to the audience. There was no fear in the audience, but a want for more from a great actor such as Frank langella as only he could play Dracula as it should be played.
1594489505|5.0|My wife and I both enjoyed this story. Highly recommend it for anyone who has an interest in Afghanistan and an insight into Muslim life. This book is well reviewed on the Amazon website, so I won't bore you with a long winded review of my own, which will only replicate what you have already read. I am not a frustrated book review critic.
B000001ELR|4.0|This was a good comback album for Kiss. I remember at the time the public opinion was that Kiss was a joke. This doomed the album in it's intial sales from the start. I used to own the original album on cassette and I must say that the remastered version is much better. The original had a muffled sound where you could not hear the high notes. The remaster sounds as if it has been remixed and that's agood thing. Eric drumming is outstanding on this album. My only complaint is that in the songs where they have the guitar solo parts it sounds as if rhythm guitar is being played instead of lead guitar. Maybe this was to hide the fact that Ace was no longer in the band. Overall a great album that I would recommend to anyone.
0618680004|5.0|This informative and sometimes funny polemic addresses both religion and many popular misunderstandings, and teaches a good deal of cosmology, evolution, and history.  It adds vital perspective to understanding any culture influenced by the Abrahamic tradition (Christian, Jewish, or Muslim).
B000001ELF|4.0|This was a good album. I really enjoy it. Ace's playing is over the top although  for the most part he could have had better lyrics. The song New York Groove is the highlight. Great melody and for the first time in a Kiss related realease I hear a disco beat, not that that is bad. He did it right, it rocks and it is a good dance song with a heavy beat. Good album.
B00003CXCT|2.0|I too am a Star Wars Ho...that is why it was so painful to see the ¨tweaking¨ of this classic set. Why Lucus felt compelled to insert the extra footage (they were omitted for a reason)...I can only guess he wanted to show off his new special effects.  The irony is that in doing so, he forfeited his self proclaimed pillar...the story (altering the bar scene where Han Solo shoots the bounty hunter was the final straw for me).  I ended up going back to my old VHS set because I could not stomach the editions-additions any more.
B00000AFDW|5.0|This is a great melodic rock album that doesn't fall short of my expectations. A great listen that will keep you moving.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|I thought I was a fan of Quentin Tarantino's work....but this film makes me question that notion.  I have all his other films (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, etc.)....as well as a few other films he was involved with (Natual Born Killers, True Romance, etc.) and I pretty-much liked them all.... that is until Death Proof came along.      First of all, let me say....Ok, I get it!  Quentin Tarantino likes the idea of \\"eavesdropping\\" on other people's conversations.  If you're unfamiliar with this Tarantino-staple, you get to hear the simultaeously mundane and profound conversations of the characters in his movies.      This is generally used to (and I hate to use this term because the subjects of a certain western-European island-nation overuse it...but it's appropriate here) brilliant effect in his films....particularly in Resevior Dogs and Pulp Fiction.      Think of watching a Tarantino film as like watching \\"Diner\\", but with more gun-play (and F-bombs!).    Anyway, QT goes way overboard in this film along those lines....and other than one brief action-sequence (and the odd smoky burn-out now and again), the first 3/4 of the film is, as others have pointed-out here, BORE-RING!    Yes, the sound-track is good, but that is standard-fair for Tarantino anyway.    As to the final car-chase, there's little if anything here that hasn't been done before...speeding, bumping, person-on-the-hood...<yawns>.  You'd be better-off watching (take your pick) Bullitt, The Seven-Ups, Vanishing Point, Dirty Mary/Crazy Larry, etc. again.                             **Spoiler Alert**     And how the Kurt Russell-character goes from being a World-by-the-B**LS tough-guy to a sniveling sissy in about 5 seconds is really irratating (it was only a flesh-wound!).   :-)    Also, there were numerous times the girls could have stopped their car and let the girl off the hood.  No more risk of girl flying off, no more danger from the road-pycho (i.e. Russell)....especially since the driver of the Challenger had a gun (and Russell, apparently, did not)!    In summary, I'm glad I didn't waste my money buying this film.  Hopefully QT's next film will be back up to his usual standards.
B000001ELB|4.0|This complation cd is good. I really like the clearity of the songs but at times they seem to polished. Overall a good album.
B000CNFC76|5.0|I was really inspired after watching this movie and I am not even a serious golfer. Very well directed and fantastic visual effects on the golf strokes. Overall, a terrific sports movie.
B000001ELD|3.0|When I originally bought this album on vinyl years ago I expected a hard rocking album to go with his image. I was shocked but after the intial shock wore off I realised the album isn't bad at all. The only weakness to me is there are too many ballads. While I do like ballads too many can be boring after a few songs. Overall this is a good record and shows his real influences.
B00009Z576|5.0|Great rock music stands the test of time, and 'Drama' is no exception!  Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes were pure MAGIC for YES, and each had a unique contribution and creative signature for the band, which worked very well.  Granted, nobody can sound like Jon Anderson, but the fact that Steve Howe, Chris Squire, and Alan White were essentially the musical core for this incarnation of YES anyway, most of the original band was still intact for 'Drama', and the addition of the very talented and professional Horn and Downes made things interesting to say the least.  The creative musicianship and vocals on 'Drama' is mindblowingly tight and refreshing, with songs that vary tempo and time signatures that keep the listener's interest.  Standout songs are 'Machine Messiah', 'Does It Really Happen?' and 'Tempus Fugit'.  The only regret and thought you may have going through your mind after listening to 'Drama' is that 'unfortunately, they just dont make music like this anymore!'
B000001FQQ|4.0|This album will get you moving. It is reallt energetic and make you feel like celebrating. Hide your heart is a great story type song. Great message. Forever is right up there with Beth as a ballad. Hot in the Shade is an overall good album with bettter hooks.
B000SZLSB2|5.0|James Blunt came out of seemingly nowhere with \\"Back To Bedlam\\" and there were many doubters who said he couldn't pull it off for a second album.<br /><br />Thankfully they're wrong.<br /><br />\\"All The Lost Souls\\" captures life in the spotlight, life on the road and life in general, with an almost Cat Stevens/1970s flair.<br /><br />The first single \\"1973\\" sets the era and \\"Same Mistake\\" and \\"Carry You Home\\" set the hook. James opens his heart and soul to his listeners, of you can get to the end of the album's \\"I Can't Hear The Music\\" and not be moved by the songs then you may want to check your pulse because it's quite possible you are dead, or at least dead inside.<br /><br />As an aside if you get a chance to see James Blunt live you will get a whole new appreciation for his music, the emotion you hear on \\"All The Lost Souls\\" and his previous CD \\"Back To Bedlam\\" is magnified ten fold when he performs.
B000001EL7|5.0|This is a great rock album. hile it does continue in the same vein as Rock and Roll Over this one is a little different in it's sound. I like the female background vocals on Tommorrow and Tonight. I don't think there is no filler material here. A must have.

B000001EL3|5.0|This is a great album for kiss. Even though it is not exactly the typical album by this band, it is awsome in it's own right. The Bob Ezerin sound is apparant but isn't that he whole idea of having a producer. So that every album has it's own sound. If every album sounded the same it would get boring after a few years. Anyway this was a great experimental album for kiss and one of my favorites.
B000OONQ30|5.0|All the good things that have been said about the (long previously available) US format of this DVD are true for this one too.  This was the concert that made opera popular, and Pavarotti a household name (Domingo and Carreras each got to be \\"one of the other three tenors\\" - until much later).  And the reason it did that was primarily due to a) their song choice - including popular numbers such as Tonight, from West Side Story, for instance, broke down the perceived divide between opera singers and the average music listener; and b) the mischievous playfulness of Domingo and Carreras' reply to Pavarotti's fioratura in the encore - along with Pavarotti's astonishment and hearty spontaneous laughter in response.  These might be opera singers, but they were having fun, and the audience, live and televised, had fun with them.<br /><br />I've been waiting for more than a decade for this DVD to come out, continually frustrated by trying to order the other format only to be told \\"it won't work in Australian DVD players\\".  My only gripe is that they changed the cover - why should we Aussies not be able to have the original cover too?<br /><br />Watching it with the benefit of nearly 20 years hindsight, perhaps what it shows most clearly is how developed Pavarotti's voice was at that time compared with Domingo and Carreras, both of whom have since become much more equal competition for Luciano.  That said, nothing hides the sheer magic of Pavarotti as a singer.  Long may the DVDs live as a testimony to him.  Vale Luciano!
B000001EXR|2.0|Kiss did not lend very well to the grunge sound. This does not sound like Kiss at all. while other albums that they made were influenced by other types of music you could still hear Kiss shining through. I could not hear Kiss in any shape or form in this album. It is the worst they ever attempted. Thank God that Ace and peter came back briefly to derail this direction they were headed in.
B00005JPRF|5.0|This is the third film adaptation of the series. Milla Jovoich (sexy girl) reprises her role as Alice; the film is directed by Russell Malchy. This time the plot focuses on Umbrella's failure to cover up its crimes and contain the virus it manufactured.  The virus then infects the entire United States as well as the majority of humanity.  It's up to Alice, one of Umbrella's former experiments to sort out the situation and put the living dead to rest in a world gone mad. Meanwhile an official of umbrella discusses plans to implement an antibody for the virus, hoping to give the zombies more intelligence/domesticate/keep them under control, Alice is the final ingredient to this plan. Alice joins with Claire Redfield and the members of stars and heads for what they hope is a safe haven in Alaska. Little do they know they are carrying an infected passenger with the lot of them.<br />The film if a bit gory, exciting, enjoyable and just long enough to get your fill of this type of genre movie.<br />One other thing about this movie in the series is that the special effects have improved tremendously and the acting was believable and fun to watch.<br />As video game to movie goes, this is one, if not the best I have viewed.  Doom sucked, so did Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, as did Street Fighter.  This was so good it was get another one added to the series-maybe next year??
B00000AF98|4.0|This is a great album. Yes you can hear the 80's pop metal influences but what's wrong with that. The anthemic title track is awsome. Reason to Live is a great ballad. On the whole a great listen that will get you moving and feeling good.
B000IU3XU6|5.0|Awake is my favorite Josh CD. I listen to it everyday. The song Awake that comes with this CD is a beautiful beautiful song. However, my favorite song is February Song. All the tracks are really great. There isn't a song that I don't like on it. Weeping is AMAZING with Ladysmith Black Mambazo. He collaborated once again with Eric Mouquet and with Imogen Heap (she's awesome!). The Making of Awake DVD is awesome. You are so funny Josh! I love you! I've watched the DVD countless times and never tire of it. Definately worth buying this version. Can't wait for the Awake Tour DVD!!!! Early 2008 :)
B000001DYJ|5.0|This album has all the energy of the original Alive album with a better clarity of sound. These live versions really kick a** !
B0007M4610|5.0|This three unit Brio set gives a nice modern spin on the classic wooden train.  Modeled after the 700 Series Nozomi (\\"Hope\\") Shinkansen (\\"New Main Line\\") \\"Bullet Train,\\" it is painted white with blue stripes like the Japanese prototype and includes painted window and roof detail.  (However, it looks more like the 300 Series.)  Due to the length of these cars (approximately  4\\"), they each run on two 4-wheel trucks or bogies which allow the cars to make sharp corners.  An ingenious design utilizing a pair of eye hooks allow the trucks to move but keep them from turning too far.  The set uses the standard Brio magnetic couplers which allow pieces in this set to couple with other Brio pieces and of course the wheels fit Brio (and other brands using the same standard) wooden track.<br /><br />The age recommendation is \\"3+\\" and it is manufactured in China.  Overall, it looks like a lot of fun and I can't wait to give this set to my nephew so we can both play with it.  I wish I had this set when I was a boy.
B00000AF95|4.0|Great album. This album has good vocals as well as great guitar solos. Animalize is a heavy guitar laiden Kiss record as should be in everyones collection.
B0002Y4TM4|2.0|I don't understand the good reviews for this album. I bought it after seeing the good reviews and after hearing Neverland. Sadly, after getting the album I found that Neverland is the only good song. The record is boring. I have listened to it at least 5 times over the last few months, and it doesn't sound any better. I wasn't impressed with this album at all.   IMHO    I have been listening to this CD again. Now it is growing on me. The CD isn't that bad. You have to listen to it several times to know the parts that are good and which are bad. Evidently I can not change my rating, but I would now give it 3 stars.
B000001ELL|5.0|This is a great album that should be given more recognition. It is often said to be there disco album but I think it's agood balance of the two types of music.
0345494997|4.0|Were it not based on actual events, I would've thought the ending so abrupt it was if the author didn't know how to end what she started.<br />However it is fact, and the  tragic and violent death of Mamah Borthwick Cheney ended the life of a woman who some would say was ahead of her time, while others a tragic, restless, irresponsible wife and Mother. I found her story fascinating, and her relationship with Frank LLoyd Wright the stuff that sweeping romances are made of. This was a woman conflicted to be sure, but also someone who went against the grain because she believed in both a greater truth and love for herself, and this brilliant architect.
B000001EIA|5.0|This is a great album. It has some really good accoustic versions of there classic songs. Coming Home accoustic buries the original. It sounds like it was meant to be recorded this way. Who couldn't like the reunion of the four original members.
B000PMGS8G|4.0|Total cheese with good music by Freddie and the boys, Flash is good humor.<br />Lotsa color and silly sets; Max was made to be Ming; Sam is suitably goofy; it's got the feel of the Crabbe originals. Helps if you've had a drink or two and are not expecting cinematic greatness, just some camped-out fun.<br />It was more fun when I was a teen, but hell, so was I.
B000001ELP|3.0|This was Kiss's attempt to grow musically. The only problem is that before they had an attitude that they didn't care if critics took them seriously. It seems that they wanted to be praised by the critics this time. They lost their fun attitude that they always had.If you push that aside it really is a good album. After several repeated listens to this album it did grow on me. I'm not sure I would like them to make another album like this but it is good for this type of music.
B0000VD04M|5.0|Anyone who doesn't like Johnny Depp hasn't seen this little masterpiece. He turns it into a unique comedy, and his chemistry with Burton is nowhere more evident.<br /><br />This movie is funny as hell, time after time, and the scene in the swamp is legendarily hilarious. Landau turns in a bravura turn as Lugosi, and his zeal after getting his swamp fix is somehow one of the funniest things I've ever seen.<br /><br />I don't see why this didn't hit bigger; way too smart, probably. In any case, here it is, ready to be a bigger cult classic as the decades go by.
B000001EKX|4.0|I agree with most that the production of this album could have been better. That's why I gave it 4 stars. The album is good though. The attitude is there.
B000P7V46C|4.0|I just heard this for the first time in years, and must say it holds up well. Deep In The Motherlode is a great tune, as are most of the songs here, and Follow Me really is a pop gem. lots of melody all over this record, as was usual for these guys back in the 70s.<br /><br />Yes, Pete's long gone and Steve just left, but that seems to let the last three injuns express themselves comfortably. Still a little prog but quickly heading in the pop direction, this album has a warm, sitting by the fire with your gal on a snowy night feel, and a lush sound that soothes and charms.<br /><br />It ain't Foxtrot, but it ain't supposed to be. From that to this in six years is pretty damn impressive, in any case! Especially with what came between...<br /><br />Tony Banks must be rock's most underrated keyboardist; so many sweet melodies and gorgeous sounds.<br /><br />They had two good ones left after this.
B00004R7TP|5.0|This has been one of my favorite albums for over 20 years, and it still never fails to impress. I think to really enjoy this one has to undestand some of the subtleties of this work. Hounds of Love is actually 2 albums, with 2 covers. Owning the original vinyl record helps, you can see the front cover of hounds of love with Kate in the pink dress. Listed there are the songs that make up Hounds of Love \\"Running up that Hill\\" to \\"Cloudbursting\\". On the flip side you can see the other \\"Cover\\" to the other work, The Ninth Wave. The Ninth Wave goes from \\"And Dream of Sheep\\" to \\"The Morning Fog\\". Where Hounds of Love is very melodic and produced the very popular \\"Running up That Hill\\" it is overshadowed by the brilliance of The Ninth Wave. The second side is the story of a young happy girl who falls though the ice while skating. She is declared dead, only to revive once she warms up. This gets her accused of being a witch. She is tried, and banished from the village, where she meets a old hag who was also banished years ago. She takes her in, saves her and she finds her place in the world. The entire side tells the story. The production of these songs is fantastic, some of the best I have ever heard. Kate's first works were produced by David Gilmor and then Andrew Powell. Kate began producing her own work with 'The Dreaming\\" and amazed us all with her work on this piece. This is the type of work that begs to be listened to on headphones. The layers of the music are so complex. It's like a movie in which each time you watch you notice something new. For anybody who like \\"Alternative\\" music, listen to one of the artists that invented the genre 30 years ago, you wont be disappointed.
B000VPUIA6|1.0|Won't you please, please help me! This is nothing more than an attempt to rape and pillage the die-hard Beatles fans of which I am one. There is so much Beatles-related garbage out there to buy. I know, I have bought more than my share. I love the Fab Four! I was a little kid when Help! came out and I was smitten and have not gotten over them since. This price, even at just under $95 is ridiculously inflated and the distributors ought to be taken out and flogged for their blatant attempt to take advantage of the Beatles fanatics. Why are you repackaging this when there is so much else that hasn't been released? How about Let It Be and the worldwide broadcast of All You Need Is Love? Where are they? Why are you recycling what is already available instead of releasing more? Help me if you can to understand. Help me if you can to justify the cost! Stop playing with our memories for your profit and give us something else, something new.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|This album was such a great surprise.  There is not a bad song on it.  I bought this album only after falling in love with The Story, the title song, but every track on this album is great!!!
0441009425|5.0|What can I say? I enjoyed this book enough that I bought some of his other books. I thought it was a little slow at times but overall still give it 5 stars.
B000006OHL|5.0|To those who disparaged the \\"smooth jazz\\" versions of the music on this CD; and to those who don't like the film dialaogue:    Between the 1950s and 1970s, it was VERY common for \\"soundtrack\\" albums to include radically rearranged music, to make the listening experience more cohesive and/or more accessible.    It was also very common to include some dialogue from the films for the same reason.    Regardless of your opinions on these practices philosophically or aesthetically, these releases helped to create the very market for soundtracks that we all enjoy today.     \\"Taxi Driver\\" was initially released on LP.  One side included the interpretations by David Blume; the other side included Herrmann's music, with dialog overdubbed onto one track (Diary of a Taxi Driver).    The CD release discussed here is sixty minutes in length, and presents the music from the film along with the LP content, to bring us a complete release of the music.  The underscore of the \\"Diary\\" track is all here elsewhere, without DeNiro's monologue.  And the David Blume versions are at the end of the CD, and easily skipped over if desired.    The producers of this disc did a good job in presenting both the music from the film while including the original \\"soundtrack\\" LP content.  They could have gone one way or the other.  I give them credit for producing a full release.
B00006ADD5|5.0|Peter O'toole's great performance is 75% of the reason that this is a fantastic movie.
B00000JZC4|4.0|This is a highlight of the year '99. I love it. The band had a huge hit in 'Take a Picture' off of this, but surrounding that song are several heavy and solid tracks. One shouldnt judge the disc off of one song.<br /><br />The 2 first tracks '..Fold' and 'Cptn. Bligh' are great and kick the cd off beautifully. Heavy doses of adrenaline with good hooks. Of course the contagious 'Best Things' is a cool upbeat song. The real tracks that get you after a few listens are 'Skinny' and the absolutely incredible 'Cancer' that just has a great dark sound. Its a creepy track that is the high point of the CD in my opinion.<br /><br />A lot of people know the 1 hit song but these guys had 2 great CD's in this and their debut. This is a gem and a 90's classic. The follow up was 'The Amalgamut' and didnt quite strike like this one did. The singer/songwriter went on to form 'Army of Anyone' with ex Stone Temple Pilots members. This is just a great collection of songs with only 1 or 2 that go off track. Sugary maybe, but even 'Picture is a really good track.  Good Buy as well seeing all the used copies now.
0446677450|5.0|Great book! Really changed the way I feel about money, and how I want to spend my future.  My husband is reading it now, then we are going to start to invest. I was always very conservative about money, this book really changed my way of thinking!
B000H305U0|4.0|Justin Timberlake is talented and musicial, and with enough appeal that separates him from most artists attempting to make a dent in contemporary pop music. With Future Love/Sex Sounds, he has brought us a cool collection of dance and hip-hop, and most of the tracks are sexy, fun, vivacious, and very modern. His transformation is an fine example of his own growth as an artist, and has helped the former member of \\"whatever that boy band was\\" completely erase the bubblegum images of an earlier era.
0143038419|4.0|Good book.  As a woman who went through a divorce, I could relate to alot of what she was going through. This book, was a fun read, but also a self help book!
0689835604|5.0|My daughter recieved this as a gift when she was about 6 months old, She is now 18 months old and still loves it more than ever! We travel A LOT! 15-20 hour plane rides 2 to 3 times a year, and this book was the best toy I could have possibly given her. When shes \\"reading\\" this book she is amused and quiet for hours on end!
B00000IQW3|4.0|'The Last Starfighter' is a 1980's cheesy Sci-Fi movie that manages to overcome the cheap special effects with its charming and enjoyable storyline.  Alex (Lance Guest) lives in a community oriented trailer park with his mother.  Girlfriend Maggie (Catherine Mary Stewart) lives in another trailer with her grandmother.  Life is a dead end here at the Starlight/Starbright trailer park, and Alex wants out.  But Alex is thinking college, not space.<br /><br />When Alex achieves a perfect score on the Starfighter video game outside the local store, alien Centauri (the amazing Robert Preston) shows up to make him a proposition.  Alex, after a trip to Rylos with Centauri, discovers the proposition is to become a real life Starfighter.  He tries to bag out but realizes its impossible after Zan-Do-Zan assassins come after him and the Beta unit left behind by Centauri.  With newfound friend Grig (played by expressive Dan O'Herlihy), a man sized lizard, Alex decides to fight for Rylos.  Unfortunately, bad guy Xur has already attacked the starbase and killed all the other Starfighters.  Alex really is The Last Starfighter, and only he can stop Xur.<br /><br />'The Last Starfighter' is a cheesy but fun movie for the entire family.  Some of the acting is wooden and the FX are cheaper than a gumball machine ring, but it still manages to pull itself off as an enjoyable movie.  Sometimes cheese is good for your film diet.  There's some good acting from Robert Preston, some comedy to make you giggle, and a bit of tension waiting to see if Alex can step into shoes bigger than he thought he'd ever wear.  Watch for a very young Wil Wheaton (from Star Trek) who plays one of younger brother Louis's friends.<br /><br />So go ahead, relax, put out some cheese and crackers, and watch this 80's Sci-Fi classic.  Enjoy!
1592332803|5.0|After becoming vegan early this year, I found myself scrambling to find delicious vegan recipes that could replicate all my favorite baked goods. However, the recipes I found on the internet were a let down. Everything I baked either didn't rise properly or came out tasting like \\"health food.\\"    I'm a religious subscriber to Colleen's fantastic podcast, Vegetarian Food for Thought, and I was absolutely THRILLED when she announced she would be coming out with a cookbook for baking. When it arrived (several days early--thanks Amazon!) I was shocked by how comprehensive it was in providing information about veganism and great baking tips (as a novice baker, I needed the extra help!). It is also beautifully produced with quality binding and paper, as well as gorgeous pictures of the goodies.    So far I've only baked one recipe (modified the zucchini bread to make banana bread), but I was very pleased with the results. I always bring my creations to work to share with coworkers, and one of them said it was the best banana bread she'd ever had and asked for the recipe!!!    Until Colleen's book came out, I thought it would be impossible to make authentic-tasting baked goods without butter or eggs, but now I know that's not true. Everyone--vegans and non-vegans alike--should own this book. If the recipes are healthier and just as tasty, what have you got to lose?
B000002W9Q|5.0|The soundtrack of the enchanting movie is also enchanting. The mesmerizing and magical \\"Time of My Life\\" is one of the best songs of all time, and the other choices are almost as good. If you've never heard it, you are in for a treat, but there are few left in that category. Good to have a copy of your own to listen to at wim.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Before I heard this album, I would have said, \\"No, I don't like Cash.\\"  I just don't like his style of music.    And then on the radio I heard him sing \\"Hurt.\\"  How much emotion can one man put into a song?    Some of the songs on the album Cash wrote, and some he didn't.  But all of these songs just genuinely come from Cash's heart.  \\"Hurt\\" was written by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails.  Who does this song the best?  Johnny Cash, no contest.  Cash just owns this song.    The music on the album is mostly minimalistic, with mostly a guitar, and a little backing with a piano.  What stands out here is Cash's voice, and I'm glad for that.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|Between the years 1250-1850, the earth experienced a Mini Ice Age that froze-over rivers, destroyed England's wine industry, and nearly starved Europe (until they discovered how to use potatoes for nourishment).  Al Gore doesn't discuss this phenomenon in his DVD, but admits in other climate-related books & lectures, \\"I don't know.\\"    And that's the fundamental problem.    How can scientists claim, \\"We can predict future weather\\", when they don't even know how to explain the past weather events?  They know there was a Mini Ice Age, they know the effects it had on humanity, but they don't know WHY it happened.  The scientists don't know.    Until scientists learn to explain past Climate Changes,   they shouldn't be making guesses about the future.
B0000VCZKM|2.0|If you were a kid when you first fell in love with this movie, then chances are that you're all grown up now.  And if you're all grown up now, chances are that you'll abhor this DVD release as much as I do.  The people who released this DVD apparently didn't realize that since it came out in 1982, it would have a large audience of people who fell in love with it then, but have grown up to be discerning movie buyers now.  And grown-ups need things with their DVD packages, especially if those packages claim to be \\"Special Anniversary Editions\\".  They need things like commentary.  Sure, John Huston is long dead, but what about the living?  Why not round up Carol Burnett, Albert Finney, Aileen Quinn and some of the girls for a real commentary track?  Grown-ups need in-depth making-of featurette documentaries, not sappy retrospectives narrated by Aileen Quinn as if she were talking to a bunch of grade-schoolers.  And grown-ups emphatically do NOT need cheesy sing-along and act-along with Annie features, or insipid trivia that any 8th-grade graduate could do.<br /><br />The worst thing of all about this DVD is the fact that it's not presented in letterboxed format.  What kind of era are we living in that we could get a movie shot in widescreen on a pan-and-scan DVD??  It almost made me cry to realize that I was missing a third of the action in most of these shots.  Had I realized that, I never, ever, would have paid for this DVD.  Let that be a lesson in always reading the packaging carefully, and never presuming for a moment that DVD manufacturers are in tune with the needs that grown-up consumers have for their movie merchandise.  I would have given this sham of a product 0 stars if I could have, but I can't bear to give so few stars to a movie I love so much.<br /><br />Looks like all I can do is keep the old tunes in mind, and modify them just a little . . . \\"Tomorrow, tomorrow, maybe we'll get a better DVD release tomorrow -- it's only a day away!\\"
B000J3EEBY|5.0|I'm a fan of all kinds of music - rock, rap, country, anything - but I also appreciate artists like Enigma, Sarah McLachlan, and Enya as well as Classical music and other stuff off the beaten path.  I've heard \\"The Mummers Dance\\" on the radio and in the movie \\"Ever After\\" a long time ago, but haven't heard anything else from Loreena since then.    So, on a whim I bought this CD along with a few of her others just to try it out, and... I just can't stop listening to it!  Out the 700-some CD's I own, THIS ONE... this one is a masterpiece, and has become an unlikely favorite for a rocker like me.    AMAZING instrumentation, lyricism, and harmonic quality just completely saturate every track.  Loreena's voice is so perfectly in tune, and so effortlessly beautiful, so unique.  Each track of this thematic album links together a story that takes place in ancient Persia that is so poetic, inspiring, and peaceful to hear in the form of a song.  Her blend of instruments has matured since her first albums, and has arrived at a diverse harmony of both new and old style sounds that you just cannot hear anywhere else.  While a departure from her lovely, melodic Celtic music, it's written to be very technically perfect and yet it comes together so naturally that you don't realize how appealing and relaxing it is at first.    Toward the end of the CD, before the d'enouement of the story, \\"Beneath a Phrygian Sky\\" will leave you stunned and wanting more.  The seemingly random assortment of intstruments become made for each other and chime in against a rhythmic beat, as she brings you into a moving vision she has on a desert night.  The poetry of the song will sweep you off your feet, and the cellist will bring tears to your eyes and send shivers up your spine.  If there was ever such a thing as a \\"perfect\\" song, this is it.  And, for me, that's saying something, especially for music that's completely outside of my normal range of listening.    Yes, it is that good.  It's like nothingI've ever heard, and I love it.  And, regardless of what you normally listen to, you will like it too.  If you're interested enough to read the reviews and you're teetering...    BUY IT.  RIGHT NOW.
B000002MY3|4.0|Morrissette is best known for being the angry chick from the huge hit single from this album, You Oughta Know.  Many people wrote her off as a one hit wonder who had a gimmick that brought her instant fame.  Delving deeper into her albums though, one will find a very talented songwriter with an incredible voice who is much more than the novelty song that brought her to the public eye.  Morrissette was actually a teen pop star in Canada long before this album came out.  Her early stuff is all bubblegum rock that bears little resemblance to the material here.  This album was definitely a 360 degree turn for her and the results were a fine album indeed.  The album produced several huge singles and is the best selling of Alanis's career.  Personally I do not think it is her best, but there is a lot to like here.  Listening to the album for the first time in a while some of the lyrics come across a bit juvenile and the music is nothing spectacular, but Morissette puts her all into the performances and the passion included here is undeniable.  Emotionally she lays it all on the line and takes no prisoners.  Her voice is like a nail on a chalkboard to some, but she really does have incredible range and sounds like no one else.  Overall this is a good album containing some of her best known works; although I think she would do better material down the road.
B000VWYJ8G|2.0|In the movie during a fight scene, the technique of the \\"tumbling/jerky camera\\" is used - made me a tad motion sick. A great movie - no.. A good movie - no.. A so so movie - okay. For people who like implausible movies, they will love this movie. After awhile, the negativity becomes really annoying. A so so movie overall in my opinion.
B00005JPRD|5.0|Ever have that experience of a lifetime at the cinema? Walking out having seen a film that truly reached out to you in the theater and grabbed you by the neck and looked you deep in the eyes, making an impression on your life that you won't forget anytime soon...and leaving you speechless for the rest of the night.    There have only been a select few films I've seen that truly gave me that experience, and I'm beyond delighted to say that the newest edition to that category is \\"Across The Universe,\\" which is in my opinion the only decent film to surface since Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.    Across The Universe deals with six major characters--a British art student from Liverpool coming to America to find his estranged father. A preppy, pretty, high school senior whose boyfriend has been drafted into the raging Vietnam War. A black guitarist from Detroit whose son has died in a peace rally. A young Asian cheerleader, running away from her home in Ohio to go after her life. A burnt-out, wannabe singer who performs at a small club and wants to show the world her music. And finally, a college drop-out with a passion for drugs, sex, and booze in search of himself.    Somehow they are all brought together by a small apartment in New York and begin to form unique bonds with each other. In the midst of the Vietnam War, and peace movements going on constantly around them, they are drawn to fighting, drugs, pursuing their dreams, finding themselves, and above all, finding true love, which is what the movie is all about.    Across The Universe is by far one of the most unique love stories ever written and unlike other deeply romantic films you may have seen, it is not sappy in the least or aimed toward female audiences. Across The Universe is not for the faint-hearted and is surprisingly gritty, hard-hitting, intense, and even shocking in many scenes. The film is shot in an extremely awkward (in a GOOD way) \\"Tim Burton\\" style that will be admired by anyone who gazes upon abstract art at a modern museum, and I was truly mesmerized.    The film seems like it is eight or nine hours long, and in no way is that a bad thing. Coming out of the theater after a 4:30 screening, when my watch showed 6:45pm, I thought it had frozen at some time during the movie. The person I saw it with couldn't believe it either. Across The Universe feels like three or four films--all with separate story lines, and all aimed at different audiences--merged into one, creating a bold fusion of film-making art. I'm being quite literal when I say it has a little something for everyone.    And as if the intricately written screenplay and exquisite direction weren't enough, the film is paired up with astonishing performances by EVERYONE in the cast, most of them largely unknown actors, and everything is hauntingly believable. I'd say a good 60% of the movie are Beatles songs, each song seemingly about the current event of the film, and the songs are sung by the actors, all of them with great voices. A lot of times I find musicals kind of worn-out, washed-up and boring, but never in my life have I been so captured by the beauty of film and music together--as one being. It was the absolute perfect addition to the film and put the icing on an already deliciously tasty cake. If you're a big Beatles fan like I am, you'll pick up on hundreds of intimate, subtle references to the Beatles' music such as character names, locations, and events.    Quite simply, this film is nothing short of a modern masterpiece, and will sweep the Oscars come February. It's a little bit of Moulin Rouge, Forrest Gump, Ghandi, and Titanic merged into one, with a Beatles soundtrack accompanying. See this film on the big screen before it leaves theaters...it will leave you gasping for air.
6301963695|5.0|Most of the reviews here are by people who were evidently expecting a soft-porn sex movie, and their disappointment tells more about them than the movie. They miss the point by focusing only on the BDSM in the relationship between Elizabeth (Kim Basinger) and John (Mickey Rourke).  There is a serious, well-told story here that people apparently obsessed with sex seem to miss.    The movie actually has three narrative perspectives that run concurrently through the film: the evolving relationship between Elizabeth and John; the evolving relationship between Elizabeth and the reclusive artist Farnsworth; and Elizabeth's interactions in NY art circles through her work at a gallery.  In the first, John, who wears nothing but black suits and white shirts and lives in a colorless and impersonal apartment, is shown to be able to feel nothing except through extreme forms of sexual expression.  In the second, Elizabeth gradually comprehends the mystical revelry of pure sensation--Farnsworth examining the fish he has caught--that also comes through in his painting.  The last--Elizabeth's art world--is the intersection of the two, between the art of pure sensation and the artifice of society and its conventions.  In the film, Elizabeth grows in all three narrative worlds and in the end achieves a kind of liberation of self, demonstrated by simply leaving John.    The film's photography is gorgeous, using darkness and rays of light to set the shifting contexts of sensuality and sensation throughout.  Rourke and Basinger are both superb in their roles--John who is painfully frozen in his incapacity to feel, and Elizabeth who grows visibly in self awareness over the course of the film.    This is a spellbinding, provocative and deeply humanistic movie about how we sense the world.  It bears repeated watching.
B0000021RD|5.0|Chicago's second album might just be their finest hour.  The songwriting is extremely good and consistent, and the jamming aspect of their early days approach is more exciting than ever before.  It's truly an experimental rock album that only the early 70's could provide.      \\"Fancy Colours\\" is probably the coolest song here, featuring a bouncy vocal melody and a twisted circus-like atmosphere played over a catchy vocal melody.  I love it.  \\"25 Or 6 to 4\\" has some of the best guitar playing ever laid down on tape.  It's a classic for a reason- it's a great, highly memorable little tune.  Some people think Black Sabbath went on later to rip off the guitar parts for their song called \\"Dirty Women\\" on the Technical Ecstasy album.  There are some similarities, to be honest.  Whether they were intentional or not we'll never know.    \\"Make Me Smile\\" is exciting for its old-fashioned sound and really good chorus.  It's a brilliant pop song.  \\"In the Country\\" works really well featuring horns, dirty guitar playing and a solid vocal melody all in one.  It really works great.  \\"So Much To Say, So Much To Give\\" is another exciting tune.    \\"Colour My World\\" really reminds me of Charlie Brown, Snoopy and everyone else from that cartoon.  I can't explain why.  It's probably the exciting old fashioned sound quality that gives the song a brilliant, though depressing atmosphere.  The \\"It Better End Soon\\" movements feature horns that remind me of opening those big doors to the land of heaven, and the sound of those instruments always bring me close to tears with their unbelievable beauty and demanding techniques.  The guitar playing is great as well.  In fact, Chicago's guitar playing is quite underrated compared to many other rock bands back in the day.    Chicago's second album is worth owning and enjoying.  Buy it today.
B000NA28I4|1.0|This movie is an embarassment to the author.<br /><br />If you have read the book - do not watch this film or you will sit there as I did and keep saying \\"What did they do the story? They had how much money? 100 million dollars and this is the best they could come up with?\\"<br /><br />LOTR had about 6 million less and it was spectacular. In Eragon they couldn't even dye Arya's hair the right color! This is embarassing.<br /><br />As an avid reader of fantasy and an award winning author (GreeHee The Journey of Five)I have taken note never to sell my rights to Fox.<br /><br />The plot of the book is based on Eragon finds egg, hatches dragon, is sought out by the Raz'ac but not being found, the Raz'ac destroy Eragon's home and his uncle Garrow is nearly killed and subsequently dies. Then Eragon seeks revenge and intends to find the Raz'ac and kill them - thus his journey of self-discovery begins.<br /><br />In the movie, which misses many important foundation issues, the plot is Eragon finds egg, hatches dragon, is sought by Raz'ac, they destroy his home and kill his uncle, then Eragon fearing the Raz'ac, flees on horseback with Brom.<br /><br />The premise is wrong and thus cannot be remedied later.<br /><br />By changing the premise, the character is flawed and we cannot recognize his strengths and weaknesses in the way the author intended.<br /><br />If you purchase the dvd and watch it first, it can be acceptable to you but it still will resonate without depth. The book is strong, deep and well written. Yes it does pull from other famous books such as Lord of The Rings and The Dragon Riders of Pern but considering how old Christopher Paolini was when he wrote it, it is a remarkable book and I look forward to future books by him.<br /><br />I would highly advise you consider the audio book rather than the dvd, if you want to be entertained and have already read the book. Listening again always brings new images and excitement. Film might have rocked if the screenplay had been co-written with the author.
B000UR366S|5.0|...and Jason Kirk is full of crap.<br /><br />A \\"fans only\\" album? The title track being \\"cloying\\" and the \\"worst offender\\" on the disc? Dude, put down the bong.<br /><br />Whether this goes down in time as Joni's greatest release ever will certainly always be a subject for debate, but to diss SHINE in this manner seems short-sighted and knee-jerk and kind of smacks of Mr. Kirk having only listened to it once or twice. Joni has definitely earned her chair at the table of great singer-songwriters and has legions of fans worldwide, but I'll step up to the plate and say that I haven't loved everything she's done (I've long since forgiven her for her \\"duet\\" with Billy Idol in the 80's [shudder])...but for those among us who've been waiting for Joni to make a comeback of sorts over the last decade, I say this: unless you are a cynic of astronomical proportions, the chances are that you will fall in deep love with this recording.<br /><br />That being said, and now that I've descended from my soapbox, I'll go on to say it's not perfect, IMHO. I'm not all that ga-ga over the opening instrumental piece, although I will say it's easier on my ears than the extended instrumental passages in the center section of \\"Paprika Plains.\\" Joni's forays into neo-classical composition have just never held me enthralled. And even though the 2007 remake of \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\" is certainly enjoyable and non-offensive, it begs the question: ummm....was it really necessary? My only other slight gripe would be in the sequencing of the last 2 tracks...had I been the producer, I would have made \\"Shine\\" the closing track and \\"If\\" would have preceded it. \\"If\\" is a classy retelling of Rudyard Kipling's poem and I like it fine, but am I the only one who thinks it ends rather abruptly? It kind of gives me the feeling of being on the dance floor and having the record stopped before it's over. \\"Shine,\\" which for these ears is one of the most GORGEOUS, INSPIRATIONAL songs Joni's ever written, is for me the perfect disc-closer. It's soft, lovely, meditative and serves as sort of a benediction for all humanity. I firmly believe it will go down into every fan's book as one of her all-time classic compositions. And it's SO good to see James Taylor working with Joni yet again on this track.<br /><br />So I close by saying again: if you're a long-time fan of Joni (as I have been since the release of MILES OF AISLES), then I feel very safe in saying that not only will this CD not disappoint, it will also grow on you with repeated listenings. As I've said about a handful of other true artists, we are very fortunate to be living in Joni's lifetime...the world is indeed a better place because of her often-imitated, never-duplicated music. Shine on, Joni.t's soft, lovely, meditative and serves as sort of a benediction for all humanity. I firmly believe it will go down into every fan's book as one of her all-time classic compositions.

B000H0FEVI|5.0|A book that is both great and sad.<br /><br />I cried like a baby while reading the last five pages.<br /><br />I believe that SOME of this book was written from past experiences in the author's own life.<br /><br />Read the author's bio at the end of the book.  And see what similarities his life had with Charlie.<br /><br />Here's a hint, there is a line in the book that reads, \\"I wonder if the other mice still played with Algernon, after he got smart.\\"
B00000K0T8|5.0|This probably the third best Wu tang solo cd. And by far the best ghostface album. Assasination day is the best song on here. 5 STARS!
B000UG4LYU|5.0|So I LOVE this album. The version of \\"Strangers When We Meet\\" on this album is far superior to the one recorded for the 1995 \\"Outside\\" album. But just so you all know - this is a 1993 album - not new, except as a domestic release. It's really fantastic. I think it's better than most of his albums from the next few years - the trilogy of Outside, Earthling and Heathen. IMHO of course.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|I really liked this big budget CGI extravaganza. Although it didn't stay true to the source material, I never expected it to anyway. As far as a stand-alone horror/adventure goes it's one of the best I've seen since \\"the mummy\\" with Brendan Fraser.<br /><br />To all those detractors who bagged the film for things like CGI or story - you missed the point of this film. It's popcorn entertainment pure and simple and hopefully introduces an entire new audience to the great horror characters featured in here.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman was great in the role, Richard Roxborough was cheesy and Kate Beckinsale was plain hot.<br /><br />Bring on the sequel (though I doubt that is gonna happen).<br /><br />Now, I need to get hold of some Hammer films and revisit Christopher Lee's dracula and Peter Cushing's Van Helsing.<br /><br />Four stars from me, and a big \\"get over it\\" to those who missed enjoying this one due to their over analysing brains.

B000002534|4.0|Borboletta would be the third and last jazz fusion studio album that Santana would record after Caravanserai and Welcome respectively. While Borboletta is like its predecessors in that it's a spiritual release that's heavy on the instrumentals, their venture into a more pop-rock sound is evident on the vocal tracks. The opening instrumentals \\"Spring Manifestations\\" and \\"Canto De Los Flores\\" recall \\"Singing Winds, Crying Beasts\\" from Abraxas with its jungle rhythms and peaceful demeanor.  The vocal tracks then begin as \\"Life Is Anew\\" is a playful Latin rock tune while \\"Give and Take\\" is hard and funky and ends with a cool jam at the end. \\"One with the Sun\\" may be the best Santana track that most people don't know. Boasting a very memorable vocal and guitar line, this could have been a hit single in a shortened version on AM radio back in the day. \\"Aspirations\\" and \\"Promise of a Fisherman\\" are both great driving Santana instrumentals that the band has made famous with the former featuring some great sax playing and Carlos providing some wicked soloing on the latter.  The remaining instrumentals are decent as \\"Here and Now\\" is very jazzy while \\"Flor de Canela\\" is more or less a prelude to the aforementioned \\"Promise of a Fisherman.\\" Other tracks include the strong \\"Practice What You Preach\\" which features a slow long build before the vocal kicks in and the bland pop song, \\"Mirage.\\" All told, Borboletta would be the last of a long string of strong albums from Santana as their future output would become less challenging and more radio friendly.
0670038040|4.0|One of the charms of the Rumpole books is that they are not just cranked out mysteries with a bit of a plot change. Each book seems to have something new. This book deals with the new sets of laws set up to be used against terror suspects and how they can be abused. This last book dealt with England just after the war.     This book has a particular resonance for Australian readers as there has just been the Haneef case. Dr Haneef was an Indican Doctor working in Queensland who had given a sim card to a relative. The relative later became involved in terrorism in London and suddenly Dr Haneef was remanded for two weeks answering questions and then charged with giving material support to terrorism. When he got bail the federal minister initiated deportation proceedings so that he could be locked up in a detention centre when he was released on bail rather than being released in the community. In the end the charges were dropped as they were based on faulty intelligence. A mistaken belief by the police that the sim car in question had been found in a car used for a suicide attack, rather than back at the relatives flat. Not only the charges were dropped but a court overturned his deportation order.     In this book Rumpole takes on a terror suspect. He finds that his work dries up and his most loyal clients leave him as they are upset at him representing a terrorist. Even characters who in past books have been portrayed as decent suggest he not take the case. Despite that he continues on and in the end is successful. The story is not only interesting in itself as an entertainment but illustrates the fact that modern terrorism laws can cause enormous damage when the police are lazy or investigate poorly. They give power to people who might make tip offs or complaints vexatiously, to cause ongoing misery.    In previous books Rumpole's addresses on the Magna Carta and the thread of justice were seen as a means that a person with a poor case could get someone off throughthe use bluster. Now in difficult times this book illustrates why the thread of justice is something more than a cliché that an old hack prattles on about. It is core to our society and to legislate it away makes things so very much worse.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Being a huge fan of Alter Bridges self titled 2004 debut, I wasnt getting my hopes up about this album. Seems sophmore efforst sometimes suck!    Man, this has got to be one of the most talented bands going  The opening track - ties that bind - starts out fairly quiet, then gets drums, then gets loud, then myles kennedys amazing vocals come in. \\"Ties that Bind\\" starts us off and it awesome! Great guitar work , pumping drums, awesome melody and vocals. Man this guy can sing.     The rest of the album follows suit.     Awesome!!
B000VZBCWE|1.0|Yes, the technical specs on this may be impressive, but what people really want is entertainment, and there's little to be had here!  Recorded over 2 nites at Montreal Forum, after their trailblazing South American extravaganza, we find Queen on familiar ground in terms of audience and setlist - they've clearly done it a thousand times before and the boredom of routine starts to show in their performance.   Afetr a promising hard-rock start, the show settles to well-trodden versions of the usual hits and concert highlights without originality or any real connection with the (unusually flat) Queen audience.   Queen's contempt for the audience here is magnifiently illustrated during the ad-lib words in Tie Your Mother Down and the 'f...ckers' remark during a hideous work-out of Jailhouse Rock - they really should have known better!  Their contempt was about to be repayed as their horrible Hot Space album nosedived with their career, never to fully recover in the States.  Queen fans deserved better on the night, and we deserve better now
7884064790|5.0|This is a genuine DVD set . I saw it at Wa Fu Jing Book Store in Beijing. And the luminous stamp on the box tell us that it is a genuine reproduction. I saw it myself in Beijing -- I am so sorry I did not buy it there and then . This price is high for me since I know it exists in Beijing for much lower price. So I will have to pick it up there when I am next in the bookstore in Beijing. The price here is about 10% of my air ticket anyway.     These are Japanese movies -- not Hollywood movies for which bootlegging is profitable. There are many who do not know this and presume all Chinese DVDs are bootlegged.     So if the price is right -- these DVDs will be of very good quality as I found of with others of this brand.

0694013013|5.0|if you want to see your child's real personality come out, buy this book!  I bought this book after we purchased \\"Brown Bear, Brown Bear\\" by Eric Carle, which our 32 mo. old son loves!  Well, \\"head to toe\\" is now his favorite book.  we call it his exercise book.  we all do the movements together & my son cracks us up with the way he moves, especially when he wiggles his hips!!! - way too cute!  it's a great book to read during the day or at bedtime, then we read him 2 other \\"quieter\\" books before bedtime to settle him down.  my son can't read yet, but i find him  looking at this book on his own & imitating the movements!!  that is really cute.  our son has become so animated when we read this book to him - it is really hilarious.  our 20 mo. old twin girls also enjoy it, too! i'm thinking of buying a 2nd copy for grandma's house.   i can't say enough good things about this book, except that it will be as entertaining for you as it is for your child!
B000MZHW40|5.0|The headline of this review basically sums it all up.  It's about as good as a movie you'll ever see.  Leo was fantastic as always, as was Djimon Hounsou.  This was one of those movies that you'll watch, and sit there staring at your ceiling for an hour afterwards, taking in what you just saw.  It's powerful, gripping, compelling, and fascinating.  I don't think I will ever purchase a diamond in my life ever again after seeing this movie.
0316067598|5.0|Marcus Luttrell is the real deal, he is the type of role model that young people should be exposed to on a massive scale.  So what if he takes his time detailing the unbelievable hellish training that the SEALS have to endure..  I had no idea what Navy SEALS go through.  He is no whiner!!  He told this hair raising story with humility, honesty, humor (if you can believe there could be anything humorous about this mindblowing story). clarity and TOTAL loyalty to his fallen brothers and this great country.  I cried my eyes out as I read about how the others were killed.  My heart was warmed with a renewed glimmer of hope in humanity as he was rescued by Afghan tribal  elders. What a story, what a great man.  It is an honor to read this book!
1400032717|4.0|This short book is written from a perspective of a 15 year old autistic boy. The reader gets into the head of this boy and understands why the kid behaves certain ways. Haddon's writing is creative and funny. In an enteratining and objective way, the author attempts to make the reader understand the actions of  this autistic boy.     As someone who has very limited real life experience with autism, I cannot comment on how acurate Haddon's portrayal of autism is but nevertheless Curious Incident is a very entertaining read. Readers may find parts of the book tedious and boring, but overall, it is a very pleasant book.
1401322336|3.0|I just bought this book over the weekend on a whim. Holy moly - out of the 40 or so cookbooks I own, this is the first that I have decided that I *must* cook every single recipe within, a la Julie and Julia. This is a great reference manual (not for the absolute-beginner cook, however), but the recipes contained within promise excellent meals, and probably a 75 pound weight gain over the next year.      UPDATE: So a few years later, I'll admit, I never cook from this book. None of the recipes really worked that well - and to echo some other reviews, were labor intensive without being very good at all.  It is a pretty good reference book, but I definitely prefer cook's illustrated/ATK books.  But it *is* a pretty book to look at.    Regarding the comment on this review? Uh, the 75 pound weight gain remark was a bit of hyperbole in order to emphasize how enjoyable I thought the recipes would prove. Weird.

Here is the gist of the book: middle class childhood and was able to get into Yale where he met people, became friends and kept in touch with. Guess what, he was able to tap the network and help himself... wow who knew?  So, if you are going to a City college you might no be meeting the \\"right\\" people. Seriously, for those with no clue about being social, this book may help them. Marketing can be learned... many of us (even experienced markeing people) at time can be a wall flower. Don't fret, just follow up and talk about things other than work.... kids, pets, sports, etc.

B000ICL3KG|1.0|Man-made global warming is a lie, or at best an extreme eggageration.  To say that global warming is caused by carbon dioxide (the chemical that us humans exhale) is nothing but terrorism.  Watch \\"The Greal Global Warming Swindle\\" on google video, & read a couple global warming books written by scientists, not politicians.  I know that Gore is really popular, but he's bought & paid for by the same super-rich special interests that own the Clintons, the Bush's, Barak, Rudy, Romney, Edwards, & almost all the rest.  These \\"special interests\\" are the people pushing for a one-world, corporate-controlled totalitarian government.  The myth of man-made global warming is an early manifestation of the \\"One World Religion\\" that these traitors are plotting to force upon us all.  Plus, the lie of man-made global warming provides a nice distraction from all the true environmental atrocities that these elite criminals commit everyday (example: toxic/nuclear waste dumping, poisioning our air & water with dangerous chemicals, & contaminating our children's vaccines with mercury to dumb down the population.)  As long as you remember the importance of recycling, planting trees, & not creating unnecessary garbage, you can rest assured that you are not killing our planet.  Say \\"NO!\\" to carbon taxes - individual taxes cannot save the environment - taxes only go into the pockets of these elite criminals who lend our country it's own money at interest from the Federal Reserve.  It's all a scam, & Al Gore is a liar & a traitor, just like the Clintons & The Bushes.  If you want to save our country, then learn the REAL, scientific truth about global warming, learn about the treasonous New World Order plot, & vote for Ron Paul 2008!
0440237688|5.0|The Giver by Lois Lowry  won the Newberry Award in 1994. (On a side note, it also won the Rebecca Caudill Young Reader's Award in 1996 which is an award sponsored by the state of Illinois!)  I'm certainly glad I decided to read it!<br /><br />\\"It was almost December, and Jonas was beginning to be frightened.\\" And so starts the story of a boy that is growing up in a time and place where sameness is the way only way of life. There is no such thing as choice. When a child is born, it is placed in the hands of a Nurturer. The child isn't even named until December. Every December, there is a ceremony celebrating the year's in the life of a child. The newchild is placed with it's new family...one that is chosen for that child. Every family unit is allowed 2 children. One boy and one girl. No more, no less. As the years progress, so do the ceremonies. At 8, the child is allowed to start his volunteer hours. At 9, the child is given his bike. And at 12, the child is given his Assignment. This assignment is the job you are going to do for the rest of your life.<br /><br />Jonas is nervous about the 12's Ceremony this year because he is to be assigned, and he has no idea what that assignment will be. As he sits in his position waiting, he hears the assignments of all his friends. But Jonas assignment is one that is a surprise to everyone. He is assigned to be the next \\"Receiver of Memories\\". It's one of the highest honors in the Community.<br /><br />When Jonas starts his training, he meets \\"The Giver\\", the man he is replacing as a Receiver of Memories. The Giver must \\"give\\" memories to Jonas. And not just memories of the Community, but memories that have been passed from Receiver to Receiver. He is given memories of color, because there is no longer color in the world of Sameness. He is given beautiful memories of snow and family and love, all things that he has never really experienced before. But when Jonas is shown what it really means to be released, he must find the courage within himself to try to change the way of life for one newchild that is about to be released.<br /><br />I thought this book was wonderful. I like dystopian books anyway. But Lowry has created a world that is structured and filled with sameness. A world that is hard to imagine. She shows us that even though the world we live in right now is filled with tough choices, at least we HAVE the right to choose. Maybe we make the wrong choice sometimes, but the alternative is not really better. And she has created a compassionate, loving and courageous character in Jonas. A character that should be admired. I can see why this book won the Newberry!! I think all young adults should read this one.ry to change the way of life for one newchild that is about to be released.

B000N4SHOE|5.0|I sought out this film, Miss Potter, specifically after buying and loving Beatrix Potter: A Journal, by Beatrix Potter. I bought THAT because I was intrigued by the entrancing and lavish manner in which it was produced. I love owning it!<br /><br />To be honest, I am not really certain how much of either work (this movie or that book) is totally accurate factually, however I enjoyed both equally! In fact, I am thinking of pairing them up as holiday gifts for members my family!<br /><br />The reason for this is that both capture the magic which I recall so very clearly, when I read the stories written and illustrated by Beatrix Potter as a little girl. I had all the books, and I also had several porcelain statues (I had Mrs. Tiggywinkle and also Jeremy Fisher. If someone was making a collection for me, that is as far as they got!). Everything connected to Beatrix Potter and her stories was enchanting to me.  If you grew up with a love of Beatrix Potter, be sure to see this film. It is beautful and moving as well.  You can enjoy the tale of Beatrix herself, a strong and fascinating woman, way ahead of her time,  while revelling in the loveliness of the scenery (the North Country of Scotland). You can respond to the charm of her drawings (which sometimes animatedly wink at you--so alive they were to her! They were her \\"friends\\"--she was a lonely child and young woman).  You can fall for her love story, which is sad indeed concerning her love life in her thirties, after the joy of true love was wrested away from her when she lost the great love of her life, underplayed in a sweet and most marvelous manner by Ewan Mcgregor, as her publisher, Norman, who was the first person who truly believed in the potential of her books.<br /><br />Ultimately Beatrix is triumphant in every way, healing in her farmhouse in the country and drawing again. Finally in love a second time, she continues to write and begins protecting her beloved countryside from developers. This will become one of her life's great purposes.<br /><br />Beatrix Potter, played to perfection by Rene Zellweger, was a shy yet determined woman. Rene Zellweger consistently amazes me by the perfection of her performances. I don't like her looks, frankly (hey, sorry!), and yet because she is such a very good actress, I find that I appreciate her value and outstanding contributions in every movie she is in. She is so good as Beatrix Potter, it's uncanny. I also think that Emily Watson as Norman's sister Millie really adds a lot to the plot. She makes the most of her part. She is downright excellent as a vunerable yet \\"tough on the outside\\" spinster, capable of great love, who has been dealt some bad cards in life, love-wise (Whist, anyone?). Several scenes between her and Beatrix are really memorable.<br /><br />I suggest you rent or buy this film and do as I did: if you like this film, maybe get the book I mentioned as well. You will be in for a great time if you love Beatrix Potter!  And really, who doesn't love Beatrix ? !t purposes.

078401213X|5.0|This film struck a chord with me, because I actually studied the history of the Jewish Kabalah. Indeed, the strong Jewish theme in this movie seems to amplify the division between Jews in real life, some of whom believe in the Kabala while others denounce it.<br /><br />The character Max Cohen starts out as a loner who seems to drift aimlessly through life, until he is discovered by stock brokers, gamblers, and a Kabalistic sect, all of whom compete against each other to use Max as their own tool for their own purposes. However, Max shows that he is not a prize to be won, and the question is left for us to ponder whether some victories are really worth winning.<br /><br />This is definitely a film which should appeal to those of us who were raised on spy dramas which focused on codebreaking. I highly recommend \\"Pi\\".
B000URDEB0|4.0|**This review is for the special edition but since they are similar I thought I would post it here**    So here we are at the first post-Tarja Nightwish album. My take on the Tarja vs. Annette debate is simply that Annette works. She's not as good a vocalist as Tarja...or even the likes of Sharon Den Adel or Floor Jansen for that matter, BUT she is good and doesn't sound at all out of place with this band. Also, Marcos sounds so much better on this album because his voice doesn't sound so drastically different to Annette's.     The best thing about this album is just how good it is musically. Since the Toumas and the rest of the band were now free from being labeled \\"Tarja's back-up band\\" the guys go all out with fantastic results. The work Toumas and crew prove to anyone who didn't already know he's the brainchild of this band.     Here's my track-by-track breakdown:    1.) The Poet And the Pendulum - Awesome. Utterly blew my mind. 5/5    2.) Bye Bye Beautiful - Bye bye Tarja, a hard hitting catchy song with Annette trading vocals with Marcos. The only fault the song has is that the lyrics are more somber and sad while the song sounds a lot more pissed off than it should, which is misleading. But it's irrelevant in the end because its such a damn good song 5/5    3.) Amaranth - OMG theez guyz wnt n totlee sold out!!!!111 DIz iz pop muzic! Shut up, you know you've had this song stuck in your head ever since you heard it and you love it. If you don't that's why there is a skip button on your CD player. And I thought \\"Nemo\\" was an addictive song! 5/5    4.) Cadence Of Her Last Breath - Musically this track is awesome but I just find the chorus kind of dull in comparison. I love the guitar solo though. - 4/5    5.) Master Passion Greed - Surgeon General's Warning: This song may cause involuntary moshing and headbanging which may result in neck injury or destruction of property. Eat it Marcelo Cabuli! 5/5    6.) Eva - It would be impossible for me to hate this song, it's just so damned beautiful and catchy. Nice work Annette. 5/5    7.) Sahara - One of the lesser tracks on the album. Catchy yes...but it just goes at this snail's pace and never really changes tempo or does anything interesting for that matter. 3/5    8.) Whoever Brings the Night - One of the few tracks I could hear Tarja singing. Damn good musically but the lyrics make me scratch my head. \\"You one-night butterfly\\"...? Something tells me some of the lyrics got lost in translation from Finnish to English. 4/5    9.) For the Heart I Once Had - The only thing that sticks out for me on this track is the poppy lighthearted melody in which Annette sings the verses. I dig that because it's unconventional. Other than that the song really doesn't gel for me. 2/5     10.) The Islander - The best Celtic sea shanty that Alice in Chains never did. One of the surprises of the album, the song that starts and makes you go \\"WTF is this?\\" and by the end of it you're singing along with it like nothing ever happened. A ballsy attempt at a folk song that pays off big time. 5/5    11.) Last Of the Wilds - Oh hell yes! I have been waiting for Nightwish to do an instrumental track since \\"Moondance\\" became one of my favorite tracks from this band. Easily one of the best and most unique tracks on the album - 5/5    12.) 7 Days To the Wolves - One of those songs that just doesn't work. Musically it sounds like an earlier Within Temptation song, and the chorus doesn't really work with the rest of the song. It's just a strange juxtaposition that never really takes off...even when the band tries to pick up the pace at the end of the song. 2/5    13.) Meadows of Heaven - Ugh....I really really wish they had omitted this track. This is how you do a ballad all wrong. First off, it's boring. Second, the chorus is just Annette saying \\"Meadows of heaven\\" over and over. If that wasn't bad enough they end the song with individuals in the chorus pulling that annoying Christina Aguilera style singing where you just vocalize all over the map and sound like a warbling cat. It's one of my biggest pet peeves in all music. Bad way to end this album 1/5    14.) Reach (Amaranth Demo Version) - Not a great track but it is an interesting view into the process in which they developed the songs on this album. Has a completely different chorus and feel to the song since Marcos is singing. And it is neat to hear this band sound raw and unpolished - 3/5    To sum up the album overall it has some duds but the majority of it is really impressive. I look forward to seeing how they advance with Annette, and hope they have as much luck with experimentation as they do on this album.     Dark Passion Play (Instrumental Version): 5 / 5. It's a major surprise to me and a great testament to the band how good this is. I'm also surprised at how much of a different dynamic tracks like Amaranth and Bye Bye Beautiful are without vocals. Even the track I hate \\"Meadows of Heaven\\" is a lot more beautiful without the boring vocals. Definitely made this Special Edition worth the money I paid for it.
B000UJBYD8|5.0|well i never to expect another sonic temple or any of there past albums because that would be a waste of time to hear the same thing again. in my opinion this album serves it's purpose, it only took one time to listen too and my ears was hooked, i love this album just as good as any other album they have put on label.when you hear songs like savages, citizens and i assain it brings back the feeling i used to get back in the day. i have'nt had that in years.

B00000IQCA|5.0|Ok, Why would anyone even watch a movie about a murder taking place in a FASHION SHOW IN PARIS if they consider glamour and beauty not to be a point in and of itself.    Aside from visual feasts the movie depicts this lifestyle in a honest way, kinda like how Office Space depicts the office life.  One scene is when these two ladies who are staying next to each other talk to each other politely as they walk each other to their hotel rooms.  When they arrive at their doors they bid their farewells and then one goes to the left and the other to the right, and as they both turn the doorknobs they both discover that the doors are locked.  AWKWARD!  well the awkwardness is depicted beautifully as they both utter polite laughts he he... if you are incapable of appreciating that then you're right, you might be too shallow to enjoy this movie!  If you can get into the depths of things that appear 'not to matter' and at the same time consider beauty and glamour a point in and of itself (it sounds contradictory but it isn't) then you will LOVE THIS!  Here are more reasons to get this movie:    -Kim Basinger has a pretty big role as this innocent reporter \\"live in Paris\\" and is stunning and funny  -Sophia Loren who I've never thought to be all THAT is in this and has a fair share of camera time, and BOY did I just change my mind!  It seems she is gorgeous now that she's old but I never really saw it when she was young.  Kim Basinger admires her jewelry :-).  -Cameo by Cher (she gets interviewed)  -Jean Paul Gaultier is in it (he gets interviewed)  -There are scenes of Paris shopping in it  -There is are cute dogs (although in the first scene, S. Loren shakes her dog a little but I'll just think she makes up for it)  -I could go on and on!!!  If you are attracted to the title in the first place, WHY WOULDN'T you like this movie??  O!  Just thought of something:  -HELENA CHRISTIANSON is in it and she has a line, Christy Turlington is in it, more...!!!
B0000AM6LY|5.0|I don't care for what I read about Mick Hucknall, but in \\"Home\\", there is a song, SUNRISE--the best part of the album.  I've purchased this album only because of this song(from Hall & Oates, soulful background track)With his words and voice added along with a beautiful girl in the background, he cannot miss with this song, NOT the album.  Not a Bob Dylan fan either, but when I receive it, will try the other songs as well.  the 5 STARS are for SUNRISE!!!
0316010669|3.0|Still reading the book but find it very interesting and informative.  Explains many thoughts, behavors that I've had in the past.
0743486285|5.0|I'll tell you what-this book has it all. The complete story of how a drug addicted millionaire spent his time and money. Excess was the rule and self entertainment was the goal. And Nikki lived to tell about. Some don't. Read the book and you can see just what the rock world and the money that goes along with it does to some of our most talented musicians.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|I never saw Grindhouse in the theatre so I don't share the disappointment that so many seem to have regarding its individual release. I do wish some of the parody trailers that I heard so much about were included in with the DVD and to be honest I think their ommission is rather tacky. However, Death Proof is an outstanding flick. Honestly since Resevoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, I have found most Tarantino movies to be forgettable. Maybe I'm just tired of movies about thugs. Death Proof is a refreshing change. The build up is slow but well worth it. There is no real action in the first half hour but it sets up the movie perfectly. The cinematography is nothing short of brilliant. By the time the action starts the viewer is at once ready for it and totally surprised by it. The final battle between the Challenger and the Charger is destined to rank in the top 5 car chase scenes of all time. I haven't seen action that good since the Road Warrior. When so many car chases/stunts look fake due to the overuse of CG it's nice to see one that goes back to the basics.  There are a couple of moments that are stomach churning but the movie is more than worth the price. I firmly believe it ranks right up there with Mad Max, the Road Warrior (well nothing is really the equal of the Road Warrior, but it's close) and Vanishing Point (which the movie pays tribute to). I hope to see more of the same coming out of Hollywood.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Excellent!  Got me from the opening credits and kept me so involved.  Kira Knightly was nominated for an oscar and rithtly so.  Story kept me wanting more and more it delivered.  Did a great job with Jane Austins work.  Bravo and three cheers to miss Austin and all involved in the movie.

Its such a great book its like so romantic and happy and even though jamie dies at the end its still really good. I didnt realy like jamie as a character i thought she was kinda boring but i still loved the book.
0316067598|2.0|I was intrigued by the dust jacket's promise of an action-packed homage to the author's deceased Navy Seal team members.  What a disappointment!  After spending the first 159 pages using too many words describing Seal training, he finally gets into the real story of the failed mission.  A good editor would have used up several red pens culling out the verbiage in this book.  He whines over and over about how unjustly the military is treated by the press, and blames his decision not to kill the goat-herders who discovered them on his Christian upbringing and what the liberal reporters would do when they hear about the murders.  More about the individuals who died, less about what goes on in Luttrell's head, and a general tightening up of this potentially exciting story, and he might have written a book worth reading.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I was wondering if there are any more cds worth buying.  I think every song is fantastic and worth every penny.  I strongly recommend this CD.  This guy knows how to make music.
B000001G6W|5.0|There are four performance of this symphony that simply rank WAY UP there for me. One of them is Fritz Reiner's Chicago on RCA's \\"Legendary Performers\\" series. Another would be Eugene Duvier's on a reduced-price DG disc. Yet another is John Eliot Gardiner's astounding reading in his Beethoven Complete Symphonies set. This one runs neck-and-neck in competion for my favorite.<br />Gardiner's fine live-performance is thrilling, but it must ultimately cede to this strong-boned - but very lithe - Karajan performance. I say strong-boned, but don't let that fool you into thinking that I mean stodgy. This is anything but stodgy. The opening movement is thunderously resonant. Compared to Gardiner, it is more declamatory. At the ending minute or two of this movement Gardiner is more superfluous, Karajan more paced with a stronger voice (this is not to say \\"stronger performance\\" in the aesthetic sense).<br />Karajan's scherzo doesn't flow as cleanly as Gardiner's, but it flows, and it is like river rapids.<br />In the Adagio, Karajan has his greatest moment. This adagio really sings, flows, and moves you whereas many other performances tend to either overdo or not accent enough.<br />Finale movement: what tends to bother me in so many other Ninths are the soloists chosen for the most famous part of the \\"Choral\\". Bernstein's Sony reading is a perfect example. Lenny has a pretty strong Ninth going, UNTIL you hear his soloists. With Karajan it is just the opposite. You get Karajan's special all-star cast: Peter Schreier, Anna Tomowa-Sintow, Agnes Baltsa, and Jose van Dam. And instead of being repeatedly disappointed as the soloists make their entrance, I kept on being rapturously surprised. These soloists, in unison with Karajan's exemplary direction of the Berlin Phil and the Vienna Singverein, will bring you one of the most thrilling Ninths of all-time. Perhaps it will even re-convince you that the Ninth is greatest work ever written. I know that I was personally already burned out from the Ninth when I bought this CD. Or perhaps it will convince you that the Choral movement was not a mistake after all. Either way, you'll be thrilled.inth when I bought this CD. Or perhaps it will convince you that the Choral movement was not a mistake after all. Either way, you'll be thrilled.
B000002OMN|3.0|This album is great and the second best Meat Loaf album ever to this day.  Everything after Bat Out Of Hell 1 up to but not including Bat II is garbage.  Everything after Bat II has been garbage including the new Bat III and Hang cool.
B000683VI4|5.0|This movie is wonderful.I love it.It is my favorite movie.It will make you laugh,it will make you cry.It is just the best.
B000HWXOR2|5.0|This single version is different than that on the \\"Still Waters\\" album, in that, it incorporates a nice electronic keyboard addition that is lacking on the album version.  Its a much smoother sounding song version.  Of course, \\"Love Never Dies\\" is one of those songs that is so good you wonder why it was left to be a single addition.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|If you enjoy shows that involve more interesting things besides rotten relationships and affairs, then you just might like this show. This isn't a \\"serious\\" drama show per se, but it has more depth than many of so-called `dramas' on TV today. The interactions between the two brothers, and their father are very interesting and moving. First part of the show: the acting/interacting isn't bad, but it isn't as good as it later gets. The action part of the show is just plain fun, and sometimes genuinely scary. There are some inconsistencies of course...i.e. mysteriously disappearing scars that the two main characters previously had. The show has plenty of clich&eacute;s, but you are relieved of them by the character Dean's sense of humor. Those petty clich&eacute;s aside, this is simply a great and fun show, with some very moving scenes. Full recommendation.
B000056VJ7|5.0|Probally the most important album ever made.  Totally amazing sound, vocals, lyrics it has it all.  This album is human love and emotion in lyrics and sound.  To bad Meat Load is making bad music these days and not this epic stuff.

B00005JPTA|5.0|Saw the trailer to this movie and I must say I was hooked. I went to see it the other day and I was not disappointed in the least. Viggo Mortenson was just tremendous. His portrayal of the Russian Mafia godfathers sons driver was powerful, menacing and dead on. Vincent Cassel was also perfect in the role of the son of the Russian mobster. Naomi Watts was aslo great as usual. The only thing I can say that some might be turned off by is the VERY graphic violence but it goes right along with the subject though it is a bit hard to watch sometimes.<br /><br />I will buy this when it comes out on DVD. I recommend it.
B000E6EGXM|5.0|Britten's reading is raw, transparent, vicious, thunderous, and very original. Especially nice is to actually understand the words of the two male soloists without having to refer to the booklet. His soloists are strong and clear, his choruses are tip-top perfect, the LSO is divine. It's hard to say something bad about this performance, except perhaps that Vishnevskaya can be slightly grating in certain sections.<br />In a lot of ways I like Robert Shaw's more \\"glossed\\" \\"mainstream\\" performance, and that performance also has a lot of punch behind it, especially the purely orchestra/chorus sections. Britten's of course, is definitive. It certainly is the strongest case to convince you of the effectiveness of the integrated texts. In the Shaw version you can hardly make English text from latin text because of the thickness of voice of tenor and bass.<br />So get this and enjoy the music, as well as the very revealing and funny rehearsals tagged on at the end of disc 2. This is a safe five-star recommendation.
B000AP04OM|5.0|The 40th edition of the Sound of Music is wonderful.  The colors and sound are so real and of course the music is supurb... a great story.  Extra features included in this edition are so interesting.  You will love it.    EWM
1582701709|2.0|Hallo everyone. I agree with the very first review that I read. I have not read the book but have read similar books mostly from Doreen Virtue and I also read the 4 agreements (among the best books I've ever read. Simple, true and understandable).  But from what I read in the review it appears that probably they wrote the book the \\"wrong\\" way. I mean sometimes when you say something you speak the \\"wrong\\" words even though you have good intentions.  Is true that the mind has a great power more than we think and is true that whatever we dream we get but...there is maybe something missing in it:  1. is true you have to work to make your dreams come true. Wishing for it is not enough.  2. The thing you wish for will come to you IF it's for your highest good and those around you.  3. What you dream for will come at the right moment.  4. The more you think about your wish there more you delay it. Why? Because we are all made of spirit and spirit is also energy. Everything and everyone has and is energy. The more you think of something and the more you hold on to it and you don't allow the dream to come true.  Think of your dream as a bird you have in your hands. If you hold on to it will the bird be able to fly? No of course.  But if you let it go, you stay positive and faithfull the bird will go the right way will the bird go the right way? Yes, whatever the way it is is always for the highest good and sometimes your way can change.    I don't believe our destiny is completely pre-written. Parts of it are but there are parts who are not written and we are the writers that's why sometimes things can change.    We were born with free will and a poweful mind. We have a big power and we should pay a little bit more attention.    Is difficult to stay positive especially when things go wrong but I do believe we can change the reality we live in by changing our thoughts.    Having money is not a bad thing. Is the way you think about the money or the way you use them that may bewrong. Money can help but the most important things are family and friends and helping people whenever you can or you want to.    Be who you want to be. God doesn't judge you. Human beings do because of their thoughts used the wrong way. We judge eachother but I think there is no best and no worse. For example I can be good at singing and you're not but you are good at math and I am not. Is not that you're worse than me because you can't sing or I am worse than you because I can't understand math. Is just that we have different gifts and abilities and instead of using them \\"against\\" eachother we should start to help eachother more and compensate eachother sharing our gifts.    I am still learning and the road may not be easy but I know it goes somewhere and I won't give up.    That's it.  Fran
0765316978|5.0|The tone of \\"The Last Colony\\" (2007) is somewhat gentler than the first two books in this series \\"Old Man's War\\" and \\"The Ghost Brigades.\\"  That allows Scalzi to cover fresh ground with his characters John Perry and Jane Sagan, as well as their adopted daughter Zoe.  There are a few surprises in store, especially for Jane, but all the apparent loose ends are tied up nicely by the novel's end.<br /><br />As usual, Scalzi's journalistic experience is evident to *this* TV reporter's eye and ear, in both his narrative and dialogue.  I found myself saying, \\"I've had conversations like that with *real* people!\\"  There's notably less profanity and \\"extracurricular activity\\" than the first two books in this series.  I'm also looking forward to the next volume in the series, entitled \\"Zoe's Tale\\" (2008).
B00005B4GU|4.0|Amnesiac was recorded in the same sessions as Kid A, which is considered by most fans and critics to be the superior album. I agree that it's more cohesive and flows better as a united work, but I don't think the music itself is really noticeably better. They're both pretty good alternative albums with heavy electronic elements. Kid A has more truly standout tracks, but there's plenty to like about Amnesiac. There's a lot of catchy parts and great moments, and of course plenty of weirdness. A lot of the songs on Amnesiac are actually more like actual songs than on Kid A, with more palatable structures and more traditional instruments. I don't think what Radiohead's become is as interesting as what they used to be in the mid-90's, but their work since the turn of the millennium is still pretty good.    \\"Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box\\" starts things off with a nice mellow sound and pleasant beeps and bloops. \\"Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors\\" has odd computerized vocals and minimal but compelling instrumentation. \\"I Might Be Wrong\\" has a good guitar riff going for it, although it does get a bit repetitive. It's followed by another less artificial song, \\"Knives Out\\". The next song is \\"Morning Bell/Amnesiac\\", another version of a track that originally appeared on Kid A. It's different enough to be interesting although it doesn't branch too far from the original. \\"Dollars & Cents\\" is easily the creepiest and most unnerving song on the album. \\"Like Spinning Plates\\" is unique sounding with the reversed effect and has a cool atmosphere. \\"Life in a Glass House\\" ends the record with a departure for the band, as hard as that is. It has a heavy jazz influence but doesn't seem too out of place. Radiohead is able to maintain an identity as an artist despite the fact that most of their albums can sound quite different.
1400063515|5.0|Not since Gregory Bateson has a writer elucidated that how we look at the world can cause focus on the wrong things and thus be drawn to irrelevant, incomplete or incorrect conclusions that carry consequences both large and small. For Bateson focus needed to be on 'relata' rather than things. For Taleb, it is studying extremes rather than central tendencies.     For me, both add immeasurably to the discussion as to how the world may actually work. Thank you Mr. Taleb for taking the time and trouble to engage us in explanation and exposition.

B000ULQV0W|5.0|I can't stop listening to it....over and over and over.  And not just one or two songs either, the entire album.  My wife has to physically pull the headphones out of my ears.  Vedder has created a brilliance I have never experienced with any other music.      Pearl Jam is incredible, but I hope for the sake of listeners everywhere that Eddie Vedder's solo career has only begun.
0765315246|5.0|In John Scalzi's \\"Old Man's War\\" (2005), his journalistic experience at the \\"Fresno Bee\\" newspaper puts him in good stead here.  Scalzi's writing style is simultaneously crisp and contemporary, while using classical storytelling. His characters are fully three-dimensional, many of the first ones we meet realistically reflect 75 years of life experience.<br /><br />While one scene toward the end is reminiscent of the opening of Robert Heinlein's \\"Starship Troopers\\" (1959), the overall tone and structure of \\"Old Man's War\\" is much closer to Joe Haldeman's \\"The Forever War\\" (1974).  There's copious profanity in Part II of III (we *are* dealing with soldiers here), and occasional sexual activity is mentioned, for those who are offended by such things.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I'm glad I bought the first season in time to watch it and then watch season 2 on Showtime. Not a disappointment!
B000SFZ05C|5.0|Not as hard edge as \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\"  but definitely a rocking album that harkens back somewhat to their 80's sound. It took a few listens to appreciate but if you like early Cult you'll dig this.   Don't let the pink album cover fool you.
B000069HKH|5.0|This album is outstanding!!!!. I bought this shortly after it came out back in 2002, although I was not heavily into the \\"Boss\\" at the time but I had been a fan in the 80s. Now in '07 I am back listening to Bruce and the band and I pulled this cd out and although it dealt with the events of 9-11 back then, it still inspires hope in the hearer today.Here is a rundown of the tracks.     1.Lonesome day-a great start to this or any cd. 6/5  2.Into the fire-a poignant tribute to firefighter on that day. 6/5  3.Waitin' on a sunny day-a hopeful peppy \\"Glory days\\" type song 5/5  4.Nothing man-a slower \\"Nebraska-esque\\" song, subtle yet poignant 5/5  5.Countin' on a miracle-a good inspiring rocker 5/5  6.Empty sky-an excellent, slow rockin' tribute song 5/5   7.Worlds apart-a good song, a departure from the norm,different but good 3/5, not a fav but good nonetheless  8.Let's be friends(skin to skin)-a bouncy romantic song,pretty good 4/5  9.Further On(Up the road)-great rocker, an updated \\"Darkness on the edge of town\\" type of song. excellent 5/5  10.The Fuse-great beginning, mid-tempo rocker, cool 5/5  11.Mary's Place-gospel tinged, outstanding rocker. another \\"Glory days\\" type 5/5  12.Your missing-sad, slow and stirring tribute to a lost loved one song 5/5  13.The Rising-outstanding, marvelous, ethereal,stirring title song. the best one the whole darn cd. 6/5  14.Paradise-another \\"Nebraska-esque\\" soul stirring song 5/5  15.My city ruins-sounds like something from \\"Greetings from Asbury Park\\" era, absolutely great. a slow paced gospel tinged masterpiece 6/5    This might be their best effort, ever. A balanced, tribute cd that stands the test of time. Even 5 years after, this one moves the soul.
B000QUCNP4|4.0|The movie is very good in what it tries to do. Since the Zodiac killer is never caught, the movie never goes beyond what is actually known about the killer. The movie allows you to see the murders, but you never see the murderer. You learn how the police picked up the few facts about the murderer and even that evidence has conflicting interpretations. There was a partial fingerprint at one of the crime scenes, but it was never matched with anyone. Was it planted? The handwriting was never matched with anyone. Did the murderer masked his handwriting somehow?    The movie delves into obsessiveness and celebrity. We never find out what exactly drives Graysmith, we are just along for the ride. What a ride! The movie is taut and suspenseful. It seems long with some almost false endings. The ending is satisfying even though you never know who the killer us.     The acting by Gyllenhaal, Downey and Ruffalo is very good. The scenery is great. The movie is violent, but not overly so. Nothing like \\"Silence of the Lambs.\\"  The humor comes naturally out of the interpersonal interactions. It is a very good mystery.

0143038419|5.0|I read this book for a book club of which I am a member.  I have to say that I wasn't too excited about reading the book because I am a well grounded Christian and do not read about New Age topics or of seeking for our \\"inner deity or god.\\"  I really thought it would be tough to get through this book with my conservative leanings, but let me tell you it was pure joy.  I absolutely loved the book, Liz, and the characters she encounters on her journey.  I even let the couple of jabs she made at the Republican party slip by (yes, I am a Republican and a veteran so I am sensitive to any insult to my party or government).  Liz hides none of her weaknesses and really lets the reader in on how badly her life spiraled downward and how she recovered. Her style is so wonderful, the way she describes things, her use of metaphors, it all just holds the reader's attention.  I really didn't want to put the book down.  She likens watching some surfers to \\" surfers slice across the water like zippers ripping open the backs of the ocean's blue party dress.\\"  Really, if you are a woman, this book is something you will be able to relate to no matter your background.  It really is a great read that will fly by and leave you sad that you don't have another 200 pages left or that you can't call Liz to check in on some of these wonderful people and where they are in life today.  Read it...you won't regret a minute of it!

B000MGUZM0|2.0|(I meant to rate this 4.5 Stars.... Annoyingly, now Amazon won't correct me that...)<br /><br />Indie-sensation Arcade Fire debuted in 2004 with the excellent \\"Funeral\\" album, and then took it sweet time to come up with a second album. Time well spent, apparently, as here comes the long awaited second album.<br /><br />\\"Neon Bible\\" (11 tracks, 47 min.) expands on the sound of the first album, with even great urgency. The opener \\"Black Mirror\\" made me think this is what ELO might sounds like in this day, just a luscious music landscape. \\"Intervention\\" starts off with a dramatic organ and builds from there, and the urgency id felt throughout. The title track is one of a few songs where the band takes a little of the gas, and to great effect. The great songs just keep rolling around, such as \\"The Well and the Lighthouse\\", and the next-to-last track the up-tempo \\"No Cars Go\\", which might be in fact the best track on here.<br /><br />\\"Neon Bible\\" is a terrific album all around. I had the good fortune of seeing Arcade Fire at Coachella earlier this year, where they put on a blazing set, bringing most of the album's songs. If you have a chance to see these guys (currently touring with LDC SoundSythem), dont's miss them!
B000HT386M|5.0|Click is a great family movie that I recommend all familys to watch in there spear time. Its about a guys basic life and the desicions he makes to eighter live it out or fast forward in time. Basicly he had his hole life in his hands. Its an extreamily funny movie. I think that this goes on the top of the list of Adam Sandler's funniest movie list. I think it goes without saying that Adam Sandler should have won an award for this movie especially since he also made fun of a few other movies at the same time.
159102594X|5.0|I'm so sick of high fantasy.  This is not that.      It's character-driven, fast-paced, and full of black humor.  \\"The Blade Itself\\" adds just the right amount of ugliness--both moral and physical--to make the story pleasurable.  It has neither the silly unreality of high fantasy, nor the disgusting grit of a book that is trying too hard to feel \\"real.\\"  The characters' contradictory personality traits will tug you in two directions at once, and the pain of that split feels great, in fiction.  See the contradictions:  The decent-minded barbarian  The suffering, likeable torturer  The powerful wizard who isn't above little demonstrations   The shallow youth falling deeply in love...    A pane of cracked glass can be more beautiful than a flawless one.  The characters' failings are the key.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Next to THE CLOSER, this is my favorite show. I had never seen it on cable but after I found out it was a story about a Serial Killer who worked for the Police Dept, I knew this show was for me. Bought the DVD that day without knowing anymore! Once it arrived, I could not stop watching. A lovable Serial Killer who only kills the bad people. What a great concept. I love how we get to \\"hear\\" Dexter think his thoughts and it's quite a feat to have the \\"thinking\\" words match up perfectly to his scenes. Michael C Hall is a genius and could not be any better for the part. He has found his niche in acting. So many Reviewers do not like Dexter's sister because she is so \\"obnoxious.\\" I think she is perfect, as it would be pretty boring to have Dexter, who says he never feels human feelings, to have a sister who is quiet and boring. They help to balance each other for what each of them lacks. I do not have Showtime and have already Pre-Ordered Season 2. I cannot wait for it to be released. Thanks Dexter for giving me such a treat!
B000SO7OMA|5.0|I just attended Loreena McKennitt's An Ancient Muse concert in Columbus on Oct 13, 2007. It was an amazing concert! I hope every fan of hers has a chance to attend one of her shows. The musicians on stage with her were excellent & she looked so happy and energetic on stage during the whole performance. I will never forget that concert. Just awesome!<br /><br />I bought a copy of this 2CD/DVD set at the show and this really does capture what the concert was like. From the soft harp notes of \\"She Moved Through The Fair\\" to a truly inspired version of \\"Raglan Road\\" (If Loreena's vocals on this song don't give you goosebumps, I don't know what will!) to the electric guitar on \\"The Bonny Swans\\" this is just an all around excellent CD\DVD set. It's too bad this set doesn't have \\"The Highwayman\\" on it, though. When Loreena & the band played that on stage last night, it was breathtaking.<br /><br />I am so thankful Loreena came back to release a new album & do this tour. This is such beautiful music by Loreena and her band. Some days I want to lose faith in humanity when I turn on the radio and hear the junk that is out there. This kind of music reassures me that there are still humans out there who are able to reach beyond themselves and show that music can be much more than a corporate tool to make money, more than a showcase of one's narrow selfish lifestyle, and even more than art. Thank you, Loreena McKennitt. THANK YOU!<br /><br />If you aren't able to see Loreena McKennitt in concert this would definitely be the next best thing. Highly recommended!
B000RJO578|3.0|From reviews and the trailer, I expected an English comedy.  While there are some funny parts, this moves sooo slooow, I just kept hoping it would pick up speed, and it didn't happen till the end. The only way this could be in the running for funniest comedy of the year is if there weren't any others.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Sara's strong voice, variety, and great piano playing are very enjoyable - much like Norah Jones' debut album [[ASIN:B00005YW4H Come Away with Me]].  If you love Norah, you've got to give Sara Bareilles a try!
B000OZ2CZW|5.0|Okay, I'm gonna to admit, I really didn't think I was going to like this CD.  But I do tend to buy CDs when I've heard at least three songs I like.  After hearing and liking Umbrella, Shut up and Drive and Hate that I love you, I went ahead and bought the CD.  Still, I had it around the house like three weeks before I finally slid it into my computer.  Next thing I know, I'm dancing in my seat, pretty much for the whole duration.  Must have been a fluke or maybe I'm just in a goofy mood.  I played it again and then again.  So I just have to go ahead and admit that I LOVE THIS CD.  It's very catchy, and dancable.  Looks like the industry has found its new IT girl.  Go RiRi.  Do your thing.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|This will look amazing on blu-ray. Pixar and Disney is blu-ray exlusive. I saw an Cars blu-ray trailer on the Pirates of the Caribian disc and its what you expect of Pixar, fantastic picture.     I thought the movie was on of the best, maby Ratatouille was a little better, but great overall entertainment for the whole family.    Now where is that Finding Nemo movie Pixar ? ;)
080701429X|5.0|This book changed my life. I have purchased this book more times than I can remember to give to other people. The author has a way of stating things with a minimum of words. This is good for the reader because a library full of other books cannot begin to have the impact, in my opinion, of this book.     Frankl does not seem to feel he is special or extraordinary is any way because he has survived his circumstances. He is kind to his readers. When I read this book I feel as though I am in his kind hands. I feel as though I am being taken care of.     One thing I always remember from this book, and think about almost daily is something he writes about how we perceive other people. He writes that often we form an opinion about someone, and then later hear something about that person from someone else that is totally different. He says perhaps we think that someone is very bad, and then hear someone say that that person is very good. He goes on to remark that what made that person good had perhaps not happened to that person yet, when our opinion was formed. Before I make opinions about others now, I think that whatever I'm about to say that is critical, may have already changed. I think we would appreciate if others would do this for us.
0120884674|5.0|Excellent reference for travelling and field work as it's half the size of the original edition. I have the original and bought this anyway. The photography is excellent and it gives you a number of views of each element, and examples of normal variation. It also manages not to leave out anything important even though it is smaller (I compared the chapters with the larger edition). But don't rely on this for exhaustive terminology; it's not meant to be a dictionary.
B00005A0N5|5.0|Nightwish has been my favorite band ever since I first listened to this album. Female-fronted Euro-metal has been trying to catch up to Nightwish for years, but Tuomas always manages to stay one step ahead of the competition with a synthesis of disparate genres and a powerful ambience usually reserved for film scores. Nightwish is a band that has never stopped growing or experimenting...but I get ahead of myself.    For this, their sophomore album (I have yet to listen to the first in its entirety), the listener is treated to a slew of upbeat Gothic metal (I know that sounds like an oxymoron) fueled by Tarja's powerful, operatic vocals and Tuomas's lush, atmospheric keyboards. The music of Nightwish builds worlds around you like stages on which the stories contained in the lyrics can come to life. Songs like Stargazers, Sacrament of Wilderness, and The Riddler are energetic, adrenaline-pumping powerhouses, while the gentle Swanheart and the moving rendition of Howard Blake's Walking in the Air are slow, ethereal journeys. Moondance is an instrumental that brings one to mind of a Russian folk dance. Passion and the Opera is pretty much what it sounds like, a guitar-laced intepretation of opera that allows Tarja to really show off her classically trained pipes. Gethsemane, perhaps my favorite song from the album, is a dynamic track of pounding pianos keys and absolutely beautiful vocal work from Tarja, her voice soaring to the heavens and back again throughout these five minutes. Pharaoh Sails to Orion is also a fantastic, hard-hitting song that balance Tarja's pure, clear voice with growling death vocals. I have to admit, I'm not really a huge fan of typical Cookie Monster grunting (one of the major reasons I can't get into After Forever, an otherwise wonderful band), I feel they are used as effectively as possible here. And fortunately, resisting influence from numerous other metal bands, I believe all the other Nightwish songs featuring male vocals (except Devil and the Deep Dark Ocean) at least give us clean ones. The album ends with the hauntingly melodic Sleeping Sun, which has obviously become a fan favorite, as it keeps popping up from tour to tour.    Looking at where Nightwish is now, it's certainly interesting to see where they've been. Tuomas's songwriting prowess have certainly evolved in the past decade, but Oceanborn remains a highlight of an eternally interesting and varied musical career. Nightwish will never quite sound like this again, especially now that Tarja is no longer their singer. I say this with neither remorse nor relief, only factually. If you're interested in metal in any form, you owe it to yourself to this band out.
B00005JMK0|5.0|Al ver esta pelicula me hizo pensar en querer dominar las computadoras y realmente me interesé por ellas. Es por eso que elegí la carrera de Ingenieria en Sistemas Computacionales, asi que puedo decir que significa mucho en mi vida. Espero que la puedan liberar en DVD muy pronto.
B000002J03|5.0|I want to make a public announcement for all. I realize that some of you out there may feel some of my comments are sarcastic and caustic. They are not meant to be. They are meant to be frivolous and of no consequence except when my fine mind takes over and relates something of interest. O.K. - stop that snickering, I can hear you. That said, I humbly apologize if I offended anyone. Now-- go away!<br />I got a job taking surveys. Yes. I had to ask Mantovani lovers how they rated Led Zepplin II. Aside from the cursing and hang-ups I found that most of them never even heard of Led Zepplin or gave them less than a one star rating. All, that is, except for a blue-haired granny in Dubuque, Iowa who gave it 5 stars. It was a sweetheart deal struck with her 16 year old grandson if he promised to never bring his electric guitar to her house. And as we all know- the deal was broken soon after she gave the rating. Poor granny. :(<br />Well, we are almost at the anniversary of this release on October 22, 1969. 22 is a very important number and very special in numerology. How or why is not important (and don't dare ask me), but for arguements sake, this album certainly was special and continues to be so til this very day.<br />It seems by the time Led Zepplin were ready to record this - the synergy started to jell in amazing ways. Now only did Page create some of the most monsterously effective riffs in rock history, but he also had the good sense to have Bonham on drums (who provided kickin' sticks throughout), John Paul Jone's instrumentality (who provided some of the sweeter, softer moments as well as walkin bass)and last but not least the sheer inventiveness of vocals by Robert Plant. Sweat, sex and rock 'n' roll is the epitome of this band. And this album is definitely one of their best.<br />So many touches here that make it so classic. Listen to the harmonica and vocals on \\"Bring It On Home\\". Zepplin begins this blues number with Plant's Missippi bluesman singing. Then it \\"morphs\\" into Page ripping your head off with that blistering riff. All the members are tough on this recording.<br />But there are many more examples of how they used their power. The studio wizardry in \\"Whole Lotta Love\\". The re-working of Killin' Floor with passages and riffs that breath new raw life into \\"The Lemon Song\\". Hope she didn't hurt you Robert. :)<br />There is much more here. But we can all tell that with songs like \\"Heartbreaker\\", \\"Living Loving Maid\\" and \\"Moby Dick\\" that this is a group definitely devoted to male urgency and essential to guys with raging hormones all over the world. And with those qualities so prevailent, no wonder Zepplin were so huge and enjoy the adoration that they have even today.<br />As a whole, I would have to say that this is one of their finest albums. The song list flows and makes sense. And what could be better than the persona of the group being conveyed by Robert Plant as the ultimate rambler, lover, and gambler in love and new conquests? There is probably no group that conveyed this heat better than Zepplin.<br />So, in closing, if you like your rock tough, gritty and a cyclone ride- get this. A rock 'n' roll ride worth the ticket.<br />Now I've got to go. Granny is calling me and she's distraught.  Seems her grandson invited some friends over with powerful amps. She's ready to jump out a window - and that's just the tune up!<br /><br />Now, where did I put that Les Paul? -- your Metamorphoo Page ripping your head off with that blistering riff.

B000UR366S|4.0|I love Joni Mitchell, and as an artist, she can compose and record as she chooses and I'll enjoy it.  However, my first impression is that the album has a sort of mechanized precision to it's recording and production.  Great lyrics, great musicianship all put together with Pro Tools® in an (almost too) precise construction.  I love organic Joni, and I love this too.    Beyond that, it's a beautiful sounding album and it's great to hear from Joni again.  What is better that ?
B0007Q6PBK|3.0|Potential buyers should be aware of what they're getting if they decide to purcahse this DVD.<br />Its greatest value is probably as an historical document.  Several sublime artists at their prime, and the first live televised broadcast from the Met.  No question that the musical aspects are superb but the images and sound leave a tremendous amount to be desired.<br /><br />The  video tape transfer is murky and whenever people move on stage you see smeary ghosting.  You get used to that but harder to put up with is the poor fidelity of the sound recording.<br /><br />On my DVD, the voices sound brittle and metallic, utterly lacking in warmth. Miking sounds like it was accomplished with one or two general stage microphones, which often make the voices seem more distant than the images on the screen.  Worse -- throughout the performance -- you will hear a low level murmurring  on the right channel, which turns out to be the prompter -- at times so distinct that you can actually hear him delivering the line to come.  Very annoying indeed.<br /><br />So, buy this for its historic value. But don't expect to be swept into the full glory of the music. There are too many unfortunate obstacles in the way.
B000UFAURI|4.0|So I have to say it...this is pretty much your typical Foo Fighters album.  The songs are tightly arranged, with softer, slow sections juxtaposed with loud, rocking sections.  Dave Grohl continues to write some memorable songs and good melodies, but if you're not listening very closely some of the songs will start to blend into each other (again...there seems to be a bit of a formula at work here).  The songs do stick in your head and I like Dave's confessional, emotional, straightforward lyrics.  I did catch the Foo Fighters on Saturday Night Live the other night and all I can say is, the band is TIGHT.  They played the heck out of The Pretender.  So overall, this is an enjoyable, albeit a bit poppy alternative CD, where you pretty much know what you're getting in advance (I would love to see Grohl take a few more risks next time).
0143038419|1.0|Reading this book is an absolute waste of time. I felt as if I was reading  a teen's attempt at a composition assignment.  There is nothing here to  inspire, ignite, or invigorate the mind, nothing for reflective learning.  The fact that many people read and love such \\"twaddle\\" is one of the  reasons why this country is drowning in a sea of mediocrity and self-  centeredness,and nosediving into a freefall of immorality.  Get a life.
B00000K19E|5.0|This is the only movie I can watch repeatedly and not get sick of it...movie being the entire series, not just part 1. So much symbolism for those that see it.  What other movie (other than maybe star wars) boasts action, love stories, and a philosophical backdrop so interwoven it could catch water? From Greek mythology to Baudrillard, from Ayn Rand to Nihilism, from Christianity to Taoism, this movie is one giant philosophical discussion.  The human spirit shines in its varieties in The Matrix, from non-conformism to systems of control (such as religion), lust/love, to loyalty of kindred spirit.  Shakespeare himself would be intrigued.
0374280967|5.0|I read this charming little confection at one sitting on a rare night when I could not sleep. If the measure of an author is ability to provide enjoyment, then Alan Bennett ranks very high. Although it treats the Queen with kid gloves, poking fun gently, the book won't get Bennet knighted, but readers will have a good time for a couple of hours and finish in a better mood. The humor is sly and gentle, the writing smooth and nicely paced, with  insights on the art of reading. The book is best taken as an elaborated joke with a point: reading makes the reader a better human being.
1416523359|1.0|I consider myself a fan of Stephen King, and have spent countless hours reading most of his work.  Unfortunately, I've never had an experience quite as bad as LISEY'S STORY, a meandering mess of a novel.<br /><br />There are many fine Amazon reviews of this book, and I agree with the spirit of nearly all of the negative reviews.  In LISEY'S STORY, King spends way too much time on the internal monologues of his main character, Lisey Landon.  Most of this book consists of her thought processes, at the expense of any action.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Lisey is not much of a character in the end.  She is not particularly likable, and almost completely defines her identity as the appendage of her famous novelist husband.  For the majority of this book, she is an angst-ridden bore who merely reacts to the events around her.  She is ultimately a flat and uninteresting character, and it's sheer torture to read her endless ramblings, which constitute about eighty percent of this book's 700 or so pages.<br /><br />I was also disappointed with this LISEY STORY's overall plot.  I found it rather silly, overwrought and hard to follow in spots, given King's endless use of flashback.  Ultimately, I found the plot a mere rehash of King's earlier novel ROSE MADDER.  There is really very little original material in this novel, and I was shocked to hear that King considered it his best.<br /><br />I think King is a fine wordsmith, but most of his recent novels contain very little story, and a great deal of literary bloat.  If you've never read King before, my advice is to skip LISEY'S STORY and focus on his earlier books (before 1988 or so) where he was able to construct decent plots.

B000MM0L2S|5.0|Well as a lifelong fan of maestro Morricone since I first heard the haunting theme of Once Upon A Time In The West when I was a kid I would say this 'tribute' is quite nice, a harmless bit of fun, it doesn't all work but lets not be too po-faced about most of it, there are certainly tracks to skip like the maudlin opener Celine Dion's I Knew I Loved You..just give me the music who needs the bolted on lyrics or soporiphic Vegas warbling..no way baby! But there are some great things and what a surprise to find a reprised Mina's Se Telefonando from '66, one of the maestro's pure pop moments and this version by young anglo/french popsters Vanessa & The O's [[ASIN:B000FTBK78 La Ballade D'o]] is really gorgeous and faithful, a good thing if it brings the maestro to a new young audience and the maestro brings me to a new young artist..hey why not? Overall an enjoyable romp through the Morricone legend.

And I will always love this movie!
B000K7VHQE|5.0|All right, this is probably a lame comparison between Little Miss Sunshine and John Ford's Grapes of Wrath but I see it.  Both films are about family and what pulls them apart and what  holds them together.  Greg Kinnear is in his own way Pa Joad trying to provide for his family dealing with economic forces he doesn't understand.  Toni Collette is Ma Joad: keeping the family together is everything.  Alan Arkin is Grandpa Joad, too old to kid himself and too old to be taken away from his home.  Paul Dano is Winfield and a redemptive Connie Rivers.  Steve Carell is Casy, a lost tag-a-long who finds his soul.  And Abigal Breslin is Rose-of-Sharon who certainly is able to bring life and hope to a family in need of both.  And that \\"beauty pageant,\\" well  if not the dust bowl is as devastating of youth and hope as the real thing.      What a great film that can take you apart and bring make you better and so much more appreciative of being a member of a  \\"real\\" family.
B000QXDED6|3.0|Great movie, but a terrible audio mix on this version.  Center channel is pushed too low, surround channels are pushed too high.  If you have the system cranked it's just fine, but if you have it on casually, the dialog is nearly impossible to hear.
B0006IUDXA|4.0|I remember seeing the commercials for this show when I was but a wee lad.  Hearing the lengendary voice of Ernie Anderson intoning over the promos.  Heck, I remember the little fall preview show (set on The Love Boat, natch, and featuring Your Favorite ABC Stars) where we first met Richard Dean Anderson's character, fixing Julie, Your Cruise Director's lapel pin, and making her starry-eyed and swoony, plus reminding her that she could see him starting Sunday night of ABC's premiere week, at 8/7 Central, right before the network debut of Tootsie.    And my eleven year old brain was hooked.  So on that night, I parked myself in front of the 25-inch Panasonic in the family room, and I watched what might have been my favorite hour of TV.  The adventures of Anderson's jack of all trades instantly became appointment viewing.    I have to admit that the show's appeal waned on me as time went by.  The later seasons - sorry, sports fans - were alternately too preachy or too gimmicky for my tastes.  I missed the basics - MacGyver, the laconic Boy Scout who thought his way through a conflict, doing battle with all types of oppressive regimes; from drug lords and bank robbers to good, ol' fashioned Commie spies.    So I resisted buying the DVDs.  I wanted to keep my favorite boyhood memories intact.     But a day ago, walking through a store, I saw season one on sale...and I decided to take a chance.    Hope was rewarded.  Faith was restored.    The pilot was everything I remembered and more...fast, fun, and a real twist on the 'traveling hero' genre.  A pinch of Maverick, a dash of Indiana Jones, stir in some Mission: Impossible, and you've got MacGyver.  And while there were a few clunkers in the bunch (the Budapest episode essentially contains so much footage from the original version of The Italian Job, I think Michael Caine's agents could request a residual check), it was refreshing to see that this was still the show I loved.    Now, I do wish that Paramount had cleaned up the original film prints.  The episodes were often too dark, and interior or night shots were usually pretty grainy.  The audio (they claim it's Dolby mono) could have been remastered, while they were at it.  And no extras?  Come on - this show at least deserved a cursory attempt at a pilot episode commentary, a documentary, a catch-up feature on Anderson...something.  Anything.    You know, if MacGyver owned this set, he'd have made a bonus feature out of an old clock radio and a Snapple cap.  And it would be awesome.  You know it would.    But no matter.  If this is what they've offered, I'll take it - it's worth the little disappointments to have this great show in my collection.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|The Jungle Book tells the story of a boy named Mowgli who is raised by wolves in an Indian jungle.  He leads an idyllic life befriended by many animals until the day that Shere Khan, the tiger, returns to the area intent on killing the boy.  The animals decide to send Mowgli to the man-village where his people can protect him.  Bagheera the panther gets the job of escorting him, but Mowgli has no desire to leave the jungle.  In his desperation. Mowgli links up with Baloo the Bear and attempts learn the \\"Bear Necessities.\\"  A good deal more happens, but I don't want to give away the whole plot.      Disney has made few movies that have maintained their popularity as well as The Jungle Book.  It is a true classic.  First, the voice talent is quite possibly the finest ever assembled for an animated film.  Younger audiences will not be familiar with names like George Sanders and Sebastian Cabot even though they were very well known in their day.  But the important thing is that every single voice is pitch perfect for the part.  The epitome of this is obviously Phil Harris who provided the booming voice of Baloo.  I must confess that Baloo is probably my favorite Disney character of all time and I can't conceive of anyone else bringing the easy charm and warmth that Harris just radiated with that incredible voice of his.    The characters are all interesting and likable.  The malicious Shere Khan comes across as incredibly suave with a wry wit that is quite funny at times.  Even relatively minor characters like Colonel Hathi and King Louie are memorable and enjoyable.  This is partly because of the excellent voice acting and partly because of the unusually sharp script.  The story moves along at a brisk pace and more than holds the interest of adults and children alike.  Mowgli seems to get in one mess after another and the jungle provides a great source of these situations.    The music is yet another high point.  The soundtrack features several tunes that are very catchy and fun.  Some are well remembered such as \\"The Bare Necessities\\" and \\"I Wanna Be Like You.\\"  But even less featured songs such as \\"Colonel Hathi's March\\" and \\"That's What Friends Are For\\" burn themselves quite pleasantly into your brain.     If The Jungle Book has a fault, it is in the animation.  The movie was made just as Disney started cutting major corners in their animation and it shows.  The character animations are definitely more sketchy and rough than you would see in a movie like Lady and the Tramp when they were more meticulous.  Fortunately, the character design was still flawless and the quality of art had not yet diminished to the extent that it would in the 1970s when the company's animation hit rock bottom.    My final verdict on The Jungle Book is that it is as entertaining an animated film as you're ever likely to see.  In many aspects of its production, it remains one of the true greats and I would recommend it to anyone of any age.  The story is interesting, the characters and voices are incredible, and the music is as catchy as any soundtrack you'll hear.  The art is a little rough but is not nearly bad enough to detract from the overall experience.
B00001U0DP|5.0|It took me almost a decade to get on board and see \\"Life is Beautiful,\\" but after viewing the DVD twice in consecutive days, once in dubbed English and once in Italian with English subtitles, I felt an urge to put in my two-cents' worth for this amazing film.  It doesn't make light of the Holocaust, but presents an inspiring, if improbable, triumph of the human spirit over that unspeakable evil.  There are real-life Guidos in this world and when faced with a grave threat like Auschwitz, they somehow find a way to rise above it.  The late Pope John Paul II was no stranger to the horrors of Nazism and Soviet communism, especially in Poland not far from Auschwitz, and it is a fitting tribute to \\"Life is Beautiful\\" that he considered it his favorite movie.  It is much the same with me and I plan to see it often enough to be able to understand it in Italian without subtitles (so as to take it in more like the way it was intended).  \\"Life is Beautiful\\" also delivers a powerful message about the married life, fatherhood, and sacrificial love.  An unforgettable event!  Fr. Dennis
B000PTYUQG|4.0|This boxed set, finally available at the bargain price it should have had to begin with, is a very good comprehensive collection of the majority of the works of one of 20th centuries most pioneering (yet enjoyable) composers. And to hear most all of it under the direction of the composer makes the collection all the more compelling.    I withhold a fifth star from the rating because the producers never used the best musical resources in these productions. Most of these performance date from an era when CBS constantly used cheap \\"pick-up\\" orchestras to cut costs. Many of the same label's recordings with Bruno Walter made around the same time suffer the same fate. In most instances, at the same time that these recordings were being made with an inferior orchestra, the composer recently gave knock-out renderings of the same work with a major ensemble, like the Philadelphia or Cleveland Orchestra. And I can recall reading dozens of personal testimonies that described how much more stunning and magnificent those performances were when compared to these recordings.    But don't let that deter you from adding this fascinating set to your collection. Nothing of it is dull or unrecommended. It just could have been so much better.
B000FA57US|4.0|I love almost all the HALLOWEEN films, but this one goes a little downhill for me for two reasons; (1)If they made the Myers house more believable and not a mansion. (2) Not hint about the stupid thorn curse, then I would probably like it a lot more! One year after stabbing her foster mother, Jamie Lloyd has been taken to a children's hospital. Since Jamie touched Michael's hand, she exhibits signs of a telepathic link with her Uncle Michael. On HALLOWEEN, Michael returns to Haddonfield to finish what he started last year. Rachel, Tina, Mikey, Spitz, and Sammy become Michael's new targets at a HALLOWEEN party as he tries to find Jamie. (That party was awesome with all the HALLOWEEN decorations and costumes!) I love the scene when Michael is chasing Jamie, Billy, and Tina through the cornfields with the car! Donald Pleasence is back playing the awesome Dr. Loomis who tries to hunt Michael throughout the HALLOWEEN night at all costs. Later, Loomis takes Jamie to the Myers house. I love scenes of the police and S.W.A.T. team stakeout at Michael's house. That's pretty cool. Loomis tries to reason with Michael one last time before the showdown. Loomis uses Jamie as bait to trap Michael. When Loomis finally stops Michael, he is taken to the police station, so that the U.S. National Guard will take Michael to a maximum-security prison until he dies, but something bad happens. What happens? You'll just have to watch! If you love the HALLOWEEN series, maybe you'll love HALLOWEEN 5: THE REVENGE OF MICHAEL MYERS!!!
0805079831|5.0|Some excellent summaries already exist in the reviews here, so suffice it to say this is a riveting read!  Most important, the book provides an economic angle on world events that reads like a whodunit instead of a textbook and makes those events fall into place in a way few other works do.  The lightbulb moments are too numerous to count.  If there is one area in which U.S. citizenry is woefully under-read, it is probably economics, and this book is a great way to overcome econophobia. It is a door-opener to a new level of understanding in both politics and economics.  A most worthy read.
1400064287|5.0|There are few books I will classify as good, even less as very good, and positively a very, very few books I would call great. This one falls into that last category.<br /><br />It's simple, the question these two authors (and brothers) set out to answer: what makes some ideas so memorable that, across time and space, they are never forgotten? I grew up in west Africa and as a child, even I had heard the Kidney Story used as one example.<br /><br />While the question is a simple one, it is not easy. After what I think must have been an incredible amount of research, the brothers Heath have answered in an elegantly simple way: according to them, there are a few characteristics (as a mnemonic, they spell SUCCES) of \\"sticky\\" ideas.<br /><br />This is literally an eye opening book for me and I cannot recommend it more. I'll be rereading this book every few months.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|Its a well known and documented fact that David Gilmour has been long trying to prove to his former bandmate Roger Waters, and to the rest of the world to some extent, that as a solo performer and as the 'new'leader of Floyd, that he has the musical chops to cut it, and Im pleased to say that with this long overdue solo breakthrough, Gilmour has not only out-Watered Waters, he has finally established himself in the public eye as a true rock god making it on his own.    Im a true believer that although Waters was in a sense the mastermind behind the concept and the angle of the mighty Floyd (where would Dark Side' be without him?)Gilmour is truly the architect of the sound. His unearthly precise, economical, and deeply emotive guitar work, his incredible clear rasping tenor, his love for a great melody and his undeniable passion for pastoral reverie are all that I personally love about the band.    But the split of the Floyd in the early eighties was a worrying time for Gilmour fans. Could he do it on his own? Did he need Waters after all? And now, after fronting two succesful Floyd projects and a couple of minor solo albums, Gilmour has done it, he's blossomed into this highly respected elder statesman of British rock, true aristocratical pedegree, and has released the beautiful On An Island'. He seems to have taken all that he loves about music and life and boiled it down to this deeply personal, medatative and very melodic album. It reached #1 in the UK, top 10 in the US, has sold millions of copies and Gilmour has proved to the world that finally, he needs no Waters to keep him buoyant.    So here we are, The Royal Albert Hall, London. The lights go down and David Gilmour takes the stage to a heroes welcome. He smiles and waves and commenses to mesmerise the crowd with his new album in its entirety and a mixture of legendary Pink Floyd songs. He is joined onstage throughout the next two and a half hours by David Crosby and Graham Nash (notibly on the majestic OnAn Island': Gilmours new Comfortably Numb')Robert Wyatt(regal cornet solo on 'Then I Close My Eyes') Floyd bandmate and friend Richard Wright is present throughout providing some trademark and beautiful keyboards, Ex Roxy Music's Phil Manazera accompanies Gilmour throughout on guitar and lastly, David Bowie emerges stage right for 'Arnold Layne' and Comfortably Numb' to close the show.    This concert is a true delight for Gilmour/Floyd fans, it really does capture the occasion beautifully. It is at once a deeply personal and moving account for all involved and the crowd are appreciative throughout. After viewing the entire concert in its entirety, I was left profoundly warm and emotional, not just because of the spectacular concert DVD I had just seen but because finally, after all these years, David Gilmour has emerged as a true talent as a solo artist, the glint in his eye still burns strong and you know that for him, the whole venture has been a deeply satisfying and proud experience.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Words cannot describe this album. Buy it!!! In fact buy 5 copies... It's that good!!!
B000V8I2QU|2.0|Would you actually buy this album if it was not put out by Springsteen? The only song of note is \\"Radio Nowhere\\". The rest is all pretty unremarkable.  The man should ditch O'Brein as a producer.  The muddy  production is terrible.  It sounds a lot like \\"The Rising\\" only with weaker songs.  And Springsteen's great voice, where did it go?  He traded in the majesty of his viseral howl (ala the \\"Born To Run\\" and \\"Darkness\\" albums) for some contrived twang.  Incidently I wrote a song called \\"FM Prayer\\" about 15 years ago, it is about isolation and the dichotomy of the power of radio and in the chorus I ask \\"Is there anybody out there?\\"  But then I always have been a bit ahead of my time...:)
0060589469|4.0|I read this book first when I was interested in the Quality movement in the early 1990's, and then again much later when I was more interested in philosophy. And that gave my feelings about quality a depth that I reckon has influenced greatly my approach to performance measurement today.<br /><br />Plus I like motorcycles, even if only the off-road kind, and have spent many hours grazing my knuckles and bruising my shins as I've maintained them too (this will make more sense when you've read the part in the book that introduces Gumption Traps)!
B00005RHGK|5.0|man, when i watched this movie all i saw were good things. from the previews alone i knew it was going to be scary good, and i was not let down. jeepers creepers, it's a name you won't soon forget. it's not about a gorefest movie, or things like that. it's more about the suspense. it gets pretty intense at some points. i really enjoyed it, and i've watched it many times since. first off, big points for coming up with a wicked looking demon. man, that was nice. pretty unforgettable you know. the whole idea and concept of the film was bangin. this demon comes out to hunt for 23 days and all he does is eat. eat what? well human body parts. whatever he's lacking or has a hunger for if you've got it he wants it, and he won't stop following you until he gets it. he sniffs you out and he decides from who he will take by smelling your fear. now that was nice. unfortunately he's been doing this for a long time, and two innocent kids just happen to stumble on him while riding on this deserted road. they see him, they get curious, and bam he's onto them. the chase is on. he follows in his beat up truck, very eerie looking, and he doesn't give up. the kids are up against something so horrible they have no idea, and by the time they do it's to late. it keeps you at the edge of your seat, and gives you that shiver right down your spine. the ending is great. didn't see it coming, but those screams down in that dark place gave me the chills. what a piece of work. after this you can't help but wonder what's really out there.
B00005JPRD|4.0|For those born too late and those who want to remember, \\"Across the Universe\\" is the sound of the times for the 60's.  \\"Across the Universe\\" takes songs composed by the Beatles and sets them into the real world environment of the 60's reinforcing the poignant and sometimes psychodelic images.     Jude (Jim Sturgess) is a Liverpool lad who signs up as a sailor and then jumps ship in the US in order to find his Dad, who he believed to be a Princeton professor.  What he finds instead is a janitor who really doesn't want a son to come into his new life.  Max (Jim Carrigan) a Princeton frat boy who's tired of college and ready to hit the scene invites him home for Thanksgiving, which Jude has never celebrated and really doesn't know much about.  Over the turkey and dressing, he meets Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood) Max's sister, who is in love with a soldier boy gone off to war.      When Max feels rejected by his family, he and Jude decide to go to New York City and Greenwich Village.  That's where the real adventure begins.  Both the War Machine and the Peace Movement are clearly depicted.  In the meantime, Lucy loses her soldier boy and comes to join the two.      There's enough humor (bad Beatles song puns, among other things) to keep you laughing after the inevitable shock and tears.  Overall, I thought this film was beautifully filmed and well acted.  Kudos to the cast and crew for such a well-thought-out film.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|The Beatles: Love. This is a good album that could have been a great album. Sir George Martin and company took a terrific idea as far as they could. They carefully avoided some cliches' and pitfalls and came up with a nice mix and a very listenable CD. I do have some problems with the backward version of Sun King, I just never saw (or heard) the point. Perhaps there was a secret message I missed? All in all however, well done!!!
B000MGUZKM|5.0|This collaboration between Randy Crawford and Joe Sample is absolutely sumptuous to listen to.  Randy's vocals are like silk.  Joe is also in top form, and together they give us a gift of R&B and jazz music at its best.<br /><br />Joe's stylish arrangements showcase both Randy's velvety vocals and Joe's exceptional acoustic piano, which complement each other nicely.  As for their musical team, Randy and Joe have surrounded themselves with only the best.  The music is smooth, polished, and covers a wide variety of emotions.  I love their interpretations of both the older songs as well as the new.<br /><br />Every track on this cd is a winner, and listening to it is time well spent.  Sit back with your cocktail and enjoy!
B000LC55F2|4.0|This is high quality film that will keep you guessing right to the very last few minutes. The Prestige is a reference to the 3rd part of a magicians trick. I.e. having made the bird and cage disappear (the 2nd part) the bird then reappears.<br /><br />Two magicians are close friends but because of a tragedy become bitter enemies. Unlike a previous reviewer I thought Christian Bales cockney accent was very convincing and Hugh Jackman without his Wolverine makeup is only just recognisable. Both lead actors are excellent and the supporting cast are good as well. David Bowie has an important cameo role in the film, on which the main plot hinges.<br /><br />The plot is quite complicated to follow in places, so you do have to concentrate, as various sequences move backward or forward in time. OK you can't take it seriously, but there is an edgy atmosphere to the whole thing that kept me rivited to the screen. You shouldn't be to surprised at this though as the director is Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins, Memento) whose films, have to date proved to be of a consistently high standard.
B000T17ZY4|5.0|[[ASIN:B000T17ZY4 All the Lost Souls]]    A wonderful follow-up CD. Songs sung from the heart. Pure listening pleasure for fans and those new to his music. This version is filled with extras that will certainly please the buyer.
B000UR9T8C|3.0|I loved the first two, I gave them both 5 stars. It's amazing how much of a joke this is compared to the first two. Although this one isn't completely terrible, the quality level is nowhere near the others, this one just feels so sloppy. There's three main reasons why this movie was a joke compared to the first two:<br /><br />REASON 1: It lacks all of the humanity that made the first two so great. The first two movies had great characters that were well written, and had motivations for everything they did. Nothing that the Green Goblin or Doc Ock did felt arbitrary. Their very existence was written in a very believable way, and all their actions and crimes had purpose to them to achieve some end goal. Tell me again, WHAT exactly was Sandman up to again the whole time?<br /><br />REASON 2: Humor was too over the top. This series has always been known for its tongue in cheek type campy humor, and it worked great in the first two. Here it felt so forced, there were so many cringe inducing scenes. From the overplayed gimmick of that desk buzzer ringing loudly at J. Jonah Jameson's desk (it's funnier if you do it just a couple times... not ONE HUNDRED times), to the absolutely horrific child actors and the terrible lines they were made to speak, everything was so over the top. During the climax of the movie, they completely slowed the movie down by putting in what felt like a 5 minute scene of Jameson asking that little girl for her camera, as she replied with all the acting talent of 2007's Bionic Woman. It's crazy that someone consciously put that unnatural scene in there. The whole thing is just so wrong.<br /><br />REASON 3: Too many subplots. I guess this pretty much ties in to Reason 1, the very reason why every character was shallow and paper thin was because this movie had one too many villains. Neither of the villains got enough time to be developed, and every time they show up it all feels so disjointed. They should've taken out one of the villains, and went much much deeper into one of the subplots, such as Peter's inner struggle. It would've been very interesting to see a truly dark, evil Spider-Man, and not an eyeliner wearing dancing buffoon.<br /><br />Scenes that were poorly written:<br /><br />--When Peter was looking at the ring in his hand, and Mary Jane unexpectedly knocks, why was he fumbling around as to where to hide the ring, only to eventually put it in his pocket? Wouldn't his pocket be the FIRST choice?<br /><br />--The scene where Gwen Stacy perilously hangs off the building, as her boyfriend and father look on calmly and talk to each other. I'm at a total loss of words here.<br /><br />--The butler dude that out of nowhere, all of a sudden deciding to tell Harry that his father's wounds came from his glider, so THEREFORE the wounds were self-inflicted. Was the script writer on CRACK here??<br /><br />--You could really tell the writers had no idea how to justify the meeting of Venom and Sandman with the way they had them just conveniently meet by chance, and say, \\"we both hate him, wanna team up real quick?\\" That should be a felony to write something like that.<br /><br />--I think this is more of an opinion based on my own understanding of the world, but I'm completely confused about how Peter could kiss Gwen Stacy in front of his girlfriend and not realize it's a big deal?<br /><br />--The ending of Sandman's story arc. He might as well have just stayed home if he's just gonna pathetically wisk away like that in the end with nothing resolved. What was that?<br /><br />This could've been a great movie had they tightened up the script, trimmed off the fat, left off one of the villains, and focused on the core of the story. Instead they made it into a cartoony, childish extravaganza that trips over itself trying to do too many things. I waited 3 years for this movie to come out...of the subplots, such as Peter's inner struggle.

0920236251|1.0|The story is not bad but certainly not the best. However what gets me is paying almost $3.50 for a book that's smaller than a 3 x 5 index card. So be warned.
B00006LLNV|5.0|This is an excellent CD, capturing the feel of the fanstastic motion picture on the life of Mexican artist, Frida Kahlo. Frida's life is fully embedded in the culture and history of Mexico. Her strength drew on Mexican values and cultural strengths, the life and vitality and resiliency of the Mexican people. Therefore any film about her must capture this aspect of Frida. She and her work are fully emersed in the context of her people and their struggle. The film is able to accomplish this and the soundtrack also succeeds marvelously by capturing the cultural context of Mexican struggles.  Elliott Goldenthal's compositions work well with the original Mexican musical artists to move the narrative forward and his ability to honor the folk songs and compliment them with seemless compositions of his own deserves the highest recognition.     The musical ambiance of the entire CD is intimate, folksong, familial, and personal. The CD has outstanding Mexican artists such as Lila Downs, but also has the songs and voices of villagers, reflecting a culture that puts hte joys and hardship of the human experience into song.     Lila Downs starts the CD with a haunting and emotive \\"Benediction and Dream\\". \\"El Conejo\\" which means, The Rabbit, is performed next with a Mexican child's voice prominent in the song to reflect the childlike and whimsical song about catching rabbits in the morning. The song is very authentic with the Mexican child singing a bit off key.      In terms of historical accuracy, the CD includes songs that were known to be favorites of both Frida Kahlo and her life partner, Diego Rivera. \\"La Bruja\\" was a favorite of Rivera and here is performed by Salma Hayek and Los Vega. This song is about witches, who abduct people only to suck their blood and bone marrow. It would seem so appropraite that Rivera would like such a work, grounded in Spanish and Mexican folklore and horror tinged with seduction and sexual overtones.     \\"La Llorona\\" was a favorite of Frida's.Here it is performed first by Chavela Vargas and then later by Lila Downs and the Mariachi Juvenile de Tecalitlan. The first presentation is tragic and emotive and the second is more joyous and celebratory. The term La Llorona is the weeping woman. Here it is a song of seduction by a singer who calls himself/herself the Black One, spicy like the green chili. It is of importance that Chavela Vargas, who performs in the film, was once lovers with Frida Kahlo. There is a sexual ambibuity about La Llorona that makes the listener uncertain if the Black One that seduces the weeping woman is male or female. Chevela Vargas also sings the song Paloma Negra, or Black Dove, again a song full of painful emotion over the inability of the lover to contain their desire for the beautiful Black Dove, a party girl. Chevela Vargas, despite her age, performs with powerful emotion.    El Poder del Norte perform \\"Carabina 30/30\\"; then the Marimberos Trio sing \\"Viva Ls Vida\\", and we also hear Trio Huaseco Caimanes de Tamuin perfomr \\"El Gusto\\" , all three of these are wonderful pieces that evokes the feel of sadness and joy, strife and pleasure, fatalism and a life fully lived. Elliott Goldenthal composed a work for Lila Downs for the film, \\"Alcoba Azul\\". Downs' ability to evoke the soul of the Spanish gypsy is evident. She sings as if sexual passion was so painful that only intercourse can kill the pain. Also, Brazillian artist Caetano Veloso sings with Lila Downs in the final piece \\"Burn it Blue\\".     Salma Hayek, with the interity of a great artist, ensured the film was truthful and reflected the individual struggle of Frida Kahlo. The soundtrack is also the genuine article. It is highly recommended.
1594489505|5.0|Hosseini has outdone himself with this second title!  While the first book gave a good insight into life in Afghanistan and emigration to the U.S.  this title gives the reader a great insight into the life of women in Afghanistan and more specifics into the progression of political change in the country.  Yes, there are brutal elements to this read, however facts can be brutal.  Reading this makes one pleased to be an American woman not subjected to the whims of brutality of a husband in a man empowered society.<br />The book is not short on its heart-wrenching emotional stories of two women caught up in their destiny of their society and that of a war-torn society, the book exposes the reader to the realities of what life is like for those in this land which our nation hopes can come to an equal minded lifestyle.<br /><br />Do read this book - it is entirely worthwhile, as is The Kite Runner.  I look forward to the third title by Hosseini!
B0000AUHPK|5.0|Well, what can be said for Wuthering Heights...personally I found the book to be utterly depressing, and came quite close to not having any redeeming qualities at all. But the movie managed to make the characters somewhat lovable, or at the very least pitiable, and just had an overall better feel to it. They left out parts, thankfully, that weren't needed, or brought the already less than likable characters to a worse standing. I cried repeatedly watching this, and it was just an overall good experience. So basically, I definitely recommend the movie, but warn against the book. However, I would suggest heavily Charlotte Bronte's 'Jane Eyre'- it is my favorite novel of all time, and seeing that Emily Bronte is Charlotte's sister their writing style....or rather eloquence in writing is similar.

B000LAZDQA|5.0|I initially saw ShortBus in the theaters, wanting to scope what all the buzz was about.  What started out as subversive curiosity turned into a truly transformative experience.  Two friends of mine and I entered the theater cackling, but we all left feeling better about this experiment we call living.<br /><br />John Cameron Mitchell and his cast have created the most intimately profound exploration of the human experience I have ever seen.  ShortBus became all the more brilliant when I watched the documentary (on the DVD) about how the film was made.  I have watched ShortBus several times since purchasing the DVD, and every time it leaves me feeling better just because I'm still breathing...not to mention it's got Justin Bond in it.  He has some of the best one-liners ever uttered in a movie.<br /><br />There is plenty of explicit sex, to be sure...  But by the end of the film, the sex is just the canvas on which the story is painted.  Here the sex is the stage (as it is in real life) for comedy, tradgedy, jealousy, love, irony, honesty...name it.  I am so relieved to see an American filmmaker celebrating human sexuality.  Too often in American culture sex is shameful, hidden, or only hinted.  Sex is part of who we are and how we relate to ourselves and others.  Finally, a movie with penetration that isn't pornographic...  It is possible to separate sex and erotica from pornography (not that I disappreove of porn, either).<br /><br />ShortBus is an honest look at people being people.  I know each character in the movie.  I can find some of each of them in almost everyone I know.  And the title is all too appropriate, because I've always felt like I've ridden the shortbus through life.  ShortBus is imperfectly perfect.<br /><br />If you really pay attention to the stories between the characters, it just might change the way you look at life.

B000N3SRRC|5.0|There's really not much to say about Clutch, other than that they freakin' rock.  With thick heavy grooves, excellent musicianship, a traditional blues flavor tempered with a modern sensibility, and Neil Fallon's distinctive and super-soulful vocals, this album is just everything you need in a kickazz rock and roll album.

B000SZLSB2|5.0|My daughter asked if I would download and then burn James Blunt's latest album \\"All The Lost Souls.\\"  Being that I have never heard of him, I was un-intently listening to the set before burning began.

In fact, I can't recall being so moved by an artist since Van Morrison's \\"Astral Weeks,\\" and that should date my years and the mountains of garbage that has transpired! If, after listening with eyes closed to \\"Same Mistake\\" and \\"I Really Want You,\\" and your eyes have not teared-up from the poetry of his song, then I shall apologize in advance by saying \\"that you have lost your soul.\\" My thanks and appreciations to James Blunt for helping me find mine again!

B000H5U65C|5.0|I'll try to keep this brief.  Mastodon is simply a perfect metal band.  They're complex, they're original, they've got plenty of melody and groove to complement the skull-crushing heaviness (and without taking away from it at all), and like many other of the best metal bands, they don't fit comfortably into this or that category.  Their style is simply their own.<br /><br />As much as I don't want to single out any one musician, drummer Brann Dailor is certainly worth a mention.  His sophisticated and explosive style definitely stands out, blending jazz and metal techniques perfectly.  It's worth noting that Mike Portnoy, Max Weinberg, and Dave Grohl are all big fans of Dailor's drumming.  When you get respect from those guys, you know you're doing something right.<br /><br />But like I said, I don't want to single anyone out, because the whole band is great, especially vocalist Brent Hinds, who combines razor-sharp screaming with more subdued singing (like on the \\"ballad\\" of the album, \\"Sleeping Giant\\").  He does a fantastic job of keeping up with the eclecticism of the music.  And if that weren't enough, you also get sweet guest appearances by Josh Homme from Queens of the Stone Age, Cedric from the Mars Volta, and Scott Kelly from Neurosis, who add even more great variety to the mix.  Apparently this is also a concept album (about the psychological effects of getting lost in the wilderness), but as compelling as that sounds, you'd be hard-pressed to follow it, as the music pretty much speaks for itself.<br /><br />All in all, this is just a killer album.  The musicianship may be a bit daunting to some, if you aren't really used to progressive metal, but I think the song-writing is very well-balanced.  I read a review from a critic who claimed the songs \\"went on for too long\\", which is just absurd, because most of the songs don't even top five minutes.  I think anyone looking for an awesome metal experience won't be disappointed here.  In my opinion, this is the best metal album since Death's \\"The Sound of Perseverence\\". Definitely check it out, especially if you're tired of the same old thing.ath's \\"The Sound of Perseverence\\". Definitely check it out, especially if you're tired of the same old thing.

1401300529|3.0|This book is well-written and well-researched.  But I think that given the title \\"the Coldest Winter,\\" Halberstam would have been well-advised to trim the \\"fat\\" from the compelling narrative that he gives of the opening months of the Korean War (when the US nearly got chased out of Korea by the North Korean Army), the US riposte at Inchon, and then MacArthur's disastrous campaign in North Korea (where he almost lost his entire Army to a massive Chinese surprise attack).<br /><br />For example, he breaks away from the exciting narrative of the fighting around the Pusan Perimeter for an over sixty page digression about the Truman Administration and a variety of other topics.  I think things like that could have been condensed to about ten pages or so and the pace of the narrative would have been preserved.<br /><br />There is also at least one eye-popping historical error when Halberstam transposes the December 8 Japanese strike on MacArthur's air force at Clark Field in the Philippines to Wake Island!  That's a pretty fantastic error and it makes me wonder why it wasn't caught by the editors (unless they held Halberstam in such reverence, they weren't willing to change the text).<br /><br />So to sum up, if you are a student of political science and are interested in a book about the Korean War and MacArthur's downfall, this is a good pick.  But it is not the brisk narrative centered around the dark days and months of 1950 and 1951 that the title \\"the Coldest Winter\\" suggests.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|\\"The Jungle Book\\" needs no praise from me; it's a lot of fun, and about as \\"hip\\" as Disney got (at least without being embarrassing about it) until Pixar started figuring into the occasion.    But I'd like to say a few words about the extras. On paper, they look pretty skimpy -- especially for a two-disc release -- but in truth, they're pretty good. There's a full-length commentary (though unfortunately many of the principals aren't around to pitch in), and an hour or so of documentaries, and that's not even getting into the games and such, which I have no interest in investigating.    My only reservation about the extra material is that it could be a bit better edited -- several of the same anecdotes pop up as many as three times. But I found it interesting to hear (and see), for instance, how Louis Prima and his band performed \\"I Wanna Be Like You\\" to inspire the Disney artists (though the band was eventually replaced on the soundtrack), and hear the complete earlier score supplied by Terry Gilkyson, which -- other than \\"The Bare Necessities\\" -- was dropped along with the original conception of the film.
0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief was one of my first ventures from my warn cocoon of fantasy adventure novels. I must say I was left... amazed.    Markus Zusak manages to weave a beautiful story with the not-quite-real settings and characters. But manages to put them into terribly real situations with the nitty gritty of life.     The story tells of the holocaust from a different perspective. Whereas we find most books such as The Diary of Anna Frank telling the story from inside the Ghettos and concentration camps, this book shifts your view 180 degrees. Looking at the situation from the other way around. Seeing as I've grown up in Israel, this is a view very rarely acknowledged.     The storytelling is flowing and engrossing. It takes about 50 pages to take off, but when it does. You get caught in the slipstream and are just dragged from page to page.    I recomended this book to many people and have passed it around to my family, people from work... Everyone thought the same thing - 5 stars!
B000002J1B|5.0|I can't quite believe this album has 110 reviews. This one will make it 111.     Yes have a lot to answer for. They seem to have invented this whole superblown, gargantuan, prog rock style. They made Genesis seem like The Ramones in comparison. Here in the UK, admitting to liking Yes was fairly dodgy even in 1974.    And by 1976, no-one would actually admit to having gone to any of their massive gigs. But tens of thousands did and I was one of them. There, I've come out. However, despite all their colossal indulgence Yes really did produce some astonishing work and Relayer was one of the best albums they ever made. More violent than Sabbath, The Gates of Delerium really is a crushing recording. You have to remember that in those days there really was nothing like it. In this way it has a special relevance to those who heard it back then. It was a revelation. Something that no-one born after the 1960's can possibly appreciate.    It seems that the US only really started to 'get' Yes after all that 'Owner Of A Lonely Heart' nonsense. When the producer behind 'Frankie Goes To Hollywood' got involved it all took on a rather tacky feel. The meat of the matter as far as Yes are concerned is contained in all the albums leading up to and including Relayer. After that - 'Going For The One'? Ooh nasty! And 'Tormato'?? Dear God in heaven!     So it's good to see that 'Relayer' is still right up there in the minds of the massive American buying public. Vindication, if you will, of a quality piece of work.    And, as other reviewers have noted, the original vinyl version really is better than any of the CD incarnations.     But what the hell, a friend of mine once said that the only way to listen to early '60's Stones records was to hear them in the original mono on an ancient Dansette record player. Well, this may be true but all truly good music shines through whatever the medium.    God damn it, on a good day you can hear this on a cassette and it will still take you there because it's that good.    No need to recommend this album. It recommends itself.    Roll on review number 112.
B00005JPFH|1.0|Spiderman had to me at least, till part 3 been the reigning champ of superhero movies, till part 3...  Then Sam Raimi decides to go the way of Joel Schumaker and pile in 3 villains into the same story line, making this movie unbearable, and to add to the insult, that whole Peter Parker does the ghostbusters walk down NY streets, OMG!  Finally we see Venom on screen and he´s there a total of what? maybe 15 minutes??!! The one villain I know tons of people were expecting to see and this is what we get, such a letdown. I only hope that if there is a part 4, Raimi gets his head back into the game and gives just one well developed villain, like he had in the past.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Al Gore is a non scientist.  And all of us know this.  We have little idea of what millions of years or (even hundreds) have to do with our climate and its change.  Ice ages.  Does anyone really know when the next one is due?  On  Global warming issues, the same things apply.  We simply do not know.  Yes,  we have more people. And more dogs, cars,  garbage,  and cats I might add. Our trees are being cut, and yes, because of more people,  we do pollute  mother earth more who we should.  Oh we can destroy it,  but hopefully most of those types of morons know this.  But our earth will take of itself.  It has managed this for millions of years.  Yet,  for political reasons,  a non scientist wants to make everyone believe he has \\"news\\"  for all of us.  There were atomic scientists who,  as we comtemplated dropping the first of two atomic bombs on Japan, seriously  thought the world might end (and the reasons has nothing to do with religion).  But it did not.  It is true, that some of Gore's ranting and clowning around does seem to make sense.  But any,  and I mean any REAL scientist of the world today,  would have produce much more evidence of this doomsday outcome Gore's insists is coming unless we stop \\"being people.\\" Any,  pharmacist or chemist of today  (that includes me) would have to produce much more \\"evidence\\" to win a Nobel prize.  The destruction of our home Earth has much to do with more carbon dioxide emissions and the glaciers melting and raising seas.  What we are headed for is extremes that in weather are much more radical than the temperatures of today.  The irony is that the earth needs carbon dioxide to us to live,  but too much and you begin to play \\"tilt\\" with our climate.  If the polar ice caps melt,  then all of us have a problem.  Sorry Al, some USA citizens might bite into this cheap cream pie idea,  but what do you say to the peoples of  China,  India, and the the rest of the developing world...do you say..\\"hey,  you guys simply cannot have your  industrialized revolution like we in the US did in the 40s and 50s. \\"  Sorry about that.  \\"You will cause the world to end.\\" I know what China's answer to us would be.  I know Gore had little to do with the facts in writing this slice of garbage for all of us to be shocked by,  and they are just a guilty. But people love mother earth or they better.  The problem is we have to live here. More people are born outside the US everyday.  Taking care of our earth home had better be on all of our minds all of the time.  But not by this type of message.  Gore did not deserve to win and 99% of the people know it.  Cure AIDs or Ebola or think of ways all of the world's people could get along.  Al Gore did not deserve this award.  But like the climates he so predicts,  the world will go on. The world's problem  is not as  simple as this new idea of \\"global warming\\" and his big charts forcing him to use tall ladders to  reach and point to.  Ever heard of the  nitrogen cycle,  Mr. Gore?  Nitrogen affects the climate maybe even more.  Who knows what we have been doing since the 1930s when we began using methods to harness the unusable N2 to a form we could make ammonia and other chemicals with.  It is not just carbon dioxide okay.  As a chemist,  I would have never suggested taking  an award of such meaning, if  I had contributed  so  little to the research that won it.  What, they gave you a prize for make a presentation --like a second grader?

B000R7GKQE|2.0|This show just took over the spot Buffy the Vampire slayer left behind, most fans did not want Buffy to end, so a few years later comes a show about two guys hunting demons, monsters etc, Hmmm sounds like the scooby gang to me, only extra-testosterone added. I´ll give it this much, they do use some nice cars.
B000EQ5SRK|5.0|I Do like the sex scenes in this movie kinda Freaky!!<br />I think the guy is kinda deranged having a video camera in everyones apartment!!<br />I would rate this movie a 5 of 5 stars!!
B0000683DH|5.0|This is the best Star Trek Movie hands down, you don´t even have to be a trekker or trekkie to enjoy it.  It does help if you know where the hate began between Kirk and Khan, but it isn´t really necessary, all you need to know is that there is some serious bad blood between these two, plus Khan explains it all in a perfectly done scene where he finds Chekov on his ship (or whats left of it) FYI, Chekov wasn´t on the Enterprise when Khan made his original appearance on Star Trek way back when, but let´s not get into that.  To see the Enterprise finally take a beating was spectacular, so far this ship had taken many lickings but never looked any worse, this time it gets it´s butt whooped. The conflict between Khan´s intelligence and Kirk´s instincts and experience as a starship captain is what makes this movie so interesting. Just see it, remeber it was made almost 20 years ago, so the effects will not be up to todays digital standards of course, but they still are pretty good.   If that scene with Kirk screaming KHAN!!!! doesn´t stick in your head , then maybe you´re not a sci fi fan.
B00003CXAA|5.0|This is the most real story of the early mafia and how they have changed with the times.<br />I have family that came from Sicily, I've been told this isn't only a movie this is a true story about the Italian people from early to mid 1900's.<br />I've also been told the Mafia started out more as a civil rights group for the Italian people as time went on they got more corrupt.<br />Who do you think owns LAS VEGAS!!<br />I rate this DVD set a 5 of 5 stars!!A MUST HAVE!!
B000OVLBEO|1.0|I just can´t recommend a movie where the main character always looks fake, and then Sam Elliot´s character knows he can only change into a rider one last time and he uses it to ride along Cage??!!! instead of going into battle beside him?? Not a good movie by any means.
B000RF7XZI|4.0|To say this is not my usual kind of movie is an understatement, but since I buy pretty much everything released on HD DVD, I picked it up thinking  my girlfriend might enjoy it.    As the title of this review suggests, I was pleasantly surprised. The movie moves quickly and does a good job of clearly laying out the challenges facing the new Queen. The acting, wardrobe and set designs are all first class. A very enjoyable film.    The picture and sound are good, especially the colorful outdoor scenes where HD DVD really shines. Some of the darker scenes are a little grainy however.    Bottom line: a good movie, with good picture and sound. Worth buying.
1400063515|2.0|Interesting perspective. Shows how unpredictable large-impact events shape life and why we must watch out for these. But you need patience to go thro the 300+ pages. Taleb spends more pages on what Black Swans are and their impact, less on what one can do to lessen their impact. Would love to hear more on what he recommends, though I will take them with a 'handful' of salt....I am as skeptical of experts as he is
1892005034|5.0|Wow.   This book has helped me immensely in my personal relationships.  By taking a step back from daily frustrations, disappointments, and stressors, and re-examining the purpose of my own and others' \\"needs,\\" this book has helped me to listen more deeply, act more genuinely, and find acceptance in difficult situations.  Rosenberg's done an amazing job in writing a clear, concise book that is helping bring more compassion and patience to the world.  Well done!
B00003CWRX|5.0|I have read a few reviews that question the historical accuracy of all the details, and I do not have enough knowledge to know whether it is accurate on every point or not, nevertheless, this is an excellent, contemporary drama.     It is extremely realistic whether it is perfectly accurate or not. Again, I do not know if it is or it isn't.     This is the movie, to me, that really showed Crowe's versatility as an actor. He really is outstanding in this movie. When you watch this movie, he portrays Jeffrey Wigand so well it is hard to believe it is Russell Crowe at times.    Crowe brilliantly portrays the moral conflict within Wigand (whether that actually happended or not) as well as the fear and paranoia he experienced. The journalists and lawyers are all shown in a very realistic manner, which all shows the ordeal Wigand had to have endured during this process.    Even though he made no attempt to look like him during this movie, I found Plummer's portrayal of Mike Wallace to be fascinating. It is hard to put my finger on it, but he really brought a presence to the screen and I loved every scene he was in.     This is an exceptional movie. Great acting, great direction, strong tension and drama, very realistic, and a great story to boot. And although it would have been easy to jump on the anti-tobacco bandwagon and turn this into a political statement, he never does. Although I am no fan of big tobacco, I am no fan of Hollywood politics either.     One of my top 10 movies.
B000V8I2QU|3.0|Doesn't surprise me people are comparing it to the River.  It's in many respects, The River Lite.  It has a couple explosive songs like Radio Nowhere and the Devils Arcade and then a handful of songs that are so jingly-jangly it could pass as a Christmas Album.<br /><br />But I'm sure the majority of Bruce fans will find this a treat compared to the over produced Rising and the rootsy band of cover musicians he used for his Seeger tribute.<br /><br />The album jams out in a rushed, explosive sound like his Born in the USA days, but still isn't that strong top to bottom.  I literally can't stand his voice on the song \\"Your own worst enemy.\\"  What is that whine he employs?  Roy Orbison?  No way.  There's a couple songs where he seems just totally out of his element vocally and this one illustrates this.  He should let his wife sing this one.  It doesn't work for him.<br /><br />But since most of his hardcore fans don't really listen to much else, this should satisfy them.  It has the same mix of redundant, heard before  Clarence riffs and even lets Lofgren almost grab your attention on a couple songs.  But not too much so, after all, it's a Springsteen album, folks.<br /><br />No, Bruce is the best kind of Commercial for a population of music fans who snub their nose to most music and limit their purchasing power to only that handful of bands they've been listening to since Born to Run.
B00000K3CR|5.0|I bought this movie to share with my granddaughter when she vists.  It is one we can share together--a rarity.
B000003TA4|5.0|It's amazing that after 15 years, this album is still so revolutionary.  If you have a copy of this, and haven't listened to it in a while, I highly recommend pulling it out and revisiting this great music.
0099727404|5.0|I read this book back when I was 18 and besides all its other values, I was completely cured of procrastination after reading it!
0060763892|3.0|Rollins certainly did his homework when researching the science and the locales in this book, the result being some intriguing content for a story, but then it went downhill from there. The characters lacked any real substance and the action was described a bit too superficially to be believable. In addition, many of the desperate situations in which the characters find themselves seem to have very convnient resolutions, like a movie with predictable plot twists. And what's with the repetitive use of one-line parahraphs? The book is infested with them! Instead of nicely flowing narrative, many of the scenes read like a list, one thing right after the other, written in repeated one-line sentences or fragments.
B000FSME1A|5.0|This may not be the Complete collection but it is an incredible movie that I can't discourage you to have.  For those looking to see as much of Apocalypse Now that you can, definitely pick this up.  It's worth the price of Coppola's commentary alone.    The two disc set includes Coppola's commentary, a video introduction, plenty of deleted scenes, and a few other featurettes that are tottally worth it.    The Hearts of Darkness documentary isn't included, and that's bad, but this set has everything else you'd want.    Definitely recommended.
B000VECAEO|4.0|Because my family does \\"Festivus\\" (ours is in March during the MN High School Hockey Tournaments!) I've be waiting for \\"The Strike\\" episode (the 9th/final season of Seinfeld) to appear. Now I see that it's too high for me to budget in the $$ to pre-order. I thought Amazon.com was a \\"discount\\" site? I've always been very happy with Amazon up until now....now I think Amazon is going a bit far. I'll wait and see if it goes down once it's released. If it's still too high on Amazon,then I think I'll go \\"on strike\\" and go elsewhere to purchase it.
B00003CWTI|5.0|Paul Thomas Anderson knows a thing or two about homages.  His second feature,[[ASIN:B000PAAJZ6 Boogie Nights]], was built around an ensemble cast.  He taught himself from the likes of Robert Altman ([[ASIN:6305918880 Nashville]], [[ASIN:B000305ZXO Short Cuts - Criterion Collection]]), and in some ways passed the great director.    Magnolia is the story of nine interlocking characters, whose, in one day in LA, lives change.    This is a wonderful movie.  One of the best of the year, in a very good year by the way.    This two disc set includes deleted scenes, featurettes, Aimee Mann's video, and a number of other things.    Must Have.
B000IHY9SE|3.0|I wasn't overtly impressed with Eminem's The Re-Up.  Although it's got some good songs, it's just lacking, severely lacking in some places.    The new artists aren't impressive, and the old ones don't give it their all.  It's almost like a cash-in.    If you want to hear better from these artists, I suggest you go for their solo albums (group for D12).
B000BRBA8S|4.0|2046 is a good movie.  The scenery is astounding and the story is one to entrall you.  But the actual movie lags a bit.  It seems to want to be slow and deliberate but has no reason to be.  It's quite a good movie.    The DVD features deleted scenes, a featurette, and others I can't think of at the moment.    Highly recommended.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Jane Austin does it again and this faithful adaptation will be a joy to all of us true romantics!
B000UJBYD8|4.0|Longtime Cult fan, and this is definitely the Cult still going strong in my opinion. Hard rocking with a good group of songs. Nothing earth shattering about the basic hard rock approach, but these guys are proven rock stars and this is basically to me your basic Cult CD, I'm just happy to have another group of great songs by them to listen to endlessly till hopefully another CD comes out in a couple years.      In the Savage Edition there is a free sticker and some demos and full length versions of some songs. Plus one of my favs kicks off disc two in Stand Alone. I can't see buying the regular version (of just ten songs), plus Stand Alone is not currently on that one. So this version is the best to get right now.     Favs include Illuminated, Citizen, DLR, Stand Alone, and of course Tiger In The Sun...oops almost abbreviated that one too! Anyway, just be happy these guys are still going strong (Billy and Ian) after all these years.
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|I just want to say how much I love the new Annie Lennox CD.  I believe she is the best female singer/songwriter of our generation.  She is truly without equal.  Songs of Mass Destruction is my pick for album of the year.  It's actually better than Diva.  Favorites are Smithereens, Love Is Blind, Sing and Fingernail Moon. Everyone should own this CD.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|Crisply directed by Paul Greengrass and starring Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, this film offers almost constant high-speed action. As in The Bourne Identity, the young protagonist suffers from amnesia. His nightmares, hallucinations, and mini-epiphanies have yet to reveal all that he wants to know about himself and especially his past. He does know, however, that he was once involved as a highly-skilled assassin in a \\"black ops\\" project (code name Treadstone) sponsored by the C.I.A. As this sequel begins, Bourne and companion Maria Kreutz (Franka Potente) are happily settled in a seaside village in India, presumably out of harm's way. And then....<br /><br />Tony Gilroy's screenplay is based on the second of three novels written by Robert Ludlum which comprise \\"The Bourne Trilogy.\\" The acting by members of the supporting cast (notably Joan Allen and Brian Cox) is consistently first-rate. Credit Oliver Wood and Dominic Watkins with the cinematography and production design which recreate violent, often deadly encounters in various locations through which Bourne flees or pursues his adversaries. He eventually establishes his \\"supremacy\\" but at a substantial cost as the film ends. I now await the adaptation of The Bourne Ultimatum, hopeful that it sustains the same high level of quality in terms of storytelling, acting, and production values. That said, I agree with others who have noted the lack of variety in the pace of plot in The Bourne Supremacy, and, the need for character development in greater depth. On balance, however, I think this is a highly entertaining film.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|This band has always surprised me in one way or another.  First of all by their very existence.  I had purchased Creed's Weathered, which was absolutely my favorite Creed album, and a couple years later I'm watching my digital cable music channel and this band that sounds a lot like Creed but with a new singer comes on.  Okay, so I'm out of the loop.  But still, I was surprised -- pleasantly -- upon purchasing One Day Remains.  Yes, some of the music did indeed sound like a throwback to Creed, but not all of it.  The stuff that was Creedesque was much better than Creed.  Hey, look, I liked Creed, I really did, in spite of Stapp's pompous faux-Christian piety.  But if someone had given me the choice between a 4th Creed release and the release of Alter Bridge's first epic CD, I would've given Stapp his walking papers myself.  AB's music sounds better, is more polished and well produced, Tremonti actually had license to let it rip and solo, and let's face it, the vocals are far superior.  Scott Stapp wishes he was Myles Kennedy.  True, One Day Remains sounded much like Creed with a new singer. However, even on that first effort, Alter Bridge defined themselves apart from their former project.    That point is definitively echoed in Blackbird.  This one caught me by surprise as well.  After I had played ODR so many times the CD exploded, I would check alterbridge.com from time to time to see if there was any news on a new disc.  I never caught sight of anything.  Then one day, again, while watching the very same digital cable music channel, I hear Rise Today.  This was a couple months ago, and let me tell you, this was a long couple of months from hearing the early release until hearing the CD in its entirety.    In a word, Alter Bridge's return is glorious!  Of course, I've just spun this disc for the first time and am giving mere impressions of what I'll learn more fully throughout the coming weeks, but this CD is as good as One Day Remains and in some parts completely blows it out of the water.  The sound is thick and rich, the guitars are interesting, loaded with snarl and brightness, the rhythm section is tight, having both a bassist that's easily heard and worth listening to and a drummer who is steady and powerful, taking similar tempo tracks and creatively making them sound unique, and of course, the vocals are as majestic as they were on the first disc.    Here are just a few high points for me.  Ties That Bind is a scorcher and an awesome way to open an album.  Brand New Start is catchy, melodic and powerful.  Coming Home has just an awesome chorus and a great feel.  Oh, and don't forget the title track.  Blackbird is epic in scope, sorrowful in mood, powerful in execution and full of hooks.  Kennedy's last note as the song winds down is worth the price of admission itself.  One By One has another infectious chorus, and Watch Over You is a nice breather, though the mid-section rocks as well.  White Knuckles was interesting to me.  The first bar of the opening riff I wasn't really fond of it.  By the second bar, I was into it.  This was an exceptional collection of songs.  Well worth the wait.  And again, these are just impressions upon my first listen.  I didn't hear a bad song on the album.  At worst I may have heard a tune or two that was \\"typical Alter Bridge.\\"  But since their sound is so catchy, that ain't half bad.    Another thing that impressed me about this album, and also the first album, was that the lyrical content is a bit more positive in nature.  AB doesn't sink to profanity or wining about their horrible lives.  They deliver songs about real human emotion, and real human emotion is not all negative.    In short, any fan of well-written, well-executed rock music should buy this CD.  It is as creative as it is powerful, as melodic as it is heavy, as epic as their first CD and yet brings a new color, a new shade to the Alter Bridge canvas.  Guys, keep this up, and you will be in this music fan's MP3 player for a long, long time.
0060564423|1.0|This is a book for right-wing people who never met a military person who didn't cause them to think, \\"What a man!!\\"  (There aren't that many military women in this book.)  And people who think that the US military goes all over the world making it safe for us and others.  And people who think it's fine to talk about shutting down a newspaper that prints things disagreeable to the military.  One might wonder why someone like me kept listening to this book.  I can only answer that I was promised excitement and many twists and turns.  But there were hardly any of these.  I skipped many tracks and followed the story just fine.  And exciting???  The protagonist can't drink a cup of coffee without your having to hear how it tasted.  If you think this is exciting, have at it.
B000IFSDZQ|5.0|I ever like the music of this Duet. This music is a really representation of my generation.   The disc \\"Baladas en Español\\" is one of the best performance in Spanish of a group with differences in languages.
1594489505|5.0|An amaing novel that I couldn't put down.  The closer I got to the end of the book, the sadder I became because I didn't want it to ever end.  After reading The Kite Runner, I was mesmerized by Hosseini's writing.  I couldn't wait to read his much-anticpated second novel. I belive A Thousand Splendid Suns is even better than the The Kite Runner. Hosseini is extremely talented...from creating strong characters, to exploring characters' feelings without boring the reader, describing political issues, etc.  Definitely one of the most fantastic books I have ever read.  I cannot wait til Hosseini publishes the next novel, if he is planning one.  Read the book....you won't be disappointed!
B000P2A256|4.0|I really was hoping a new disc of this group. It has a fresh and different music.
B000000OU0|5.0|The Eagles' Hell Freezes Over (1994) really brings it all together for Eagles fans. Mostly, it's a live performance, but there are four new studio cuts included, too.<br /><br />The new songs include a rocker (Get Over It) and a ballad (Learn To Be Still) from Don Henley, a Poco-sounding love song (Love Will Keep Us Alive) sung by Timothy B. Schmidt, and a country tune (The Girl From Yesterday) by Glenn Frey. These all sound solid, and it's a nice way to open an album of old favorites performed live by the recently reunited Eagles.<br /><br />The live set is mostly acoustic, and it's main focus is on the Hotel California era (5 of the 11 live songs). There's a very good unplugged version of Hotel Califonia, and good performances of Wasted Time, The Last Resort, and Joe Walsh's Pretty Maids All In A Row. Then they rock out a bit on HC's Life In The Fast Lane.<br /><br />Timothy B. Schmidt's vocals are in the spotlight again on I Can't Tell You Why, and Don Henley sings the intriguing New York Minute from his solo album, End Of The Innocence.<br /><br />Joe Walsh plays slide guitar and sings In The City from the movie soundtrack of The Warriors, and The Eagles album, The Long Run.<br /><br />They do unplugged versions of old favorites Tequilla Sunrise, Take It Easy, and close the album with Desperado.<br /><br />Hell Freezes Over has a laid-back, intimate, and celebratory feel to it. It was recorded for MTV in Burbank, CA, in front of a respectful and appreciative audience, and it sounds clear, crisp, and joyful. It's also The Eagles best album.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Planet Earth on Bluray is absolutely amazing.  If you want a title that shows off your HD TV, this is the one to buy.  The cinematography is breathtaking and the biology is accurate and informative.  I hope BBC comes out with more \\"big budget\\" documentaries.
B000063KG6|2.0|Most people, when asked about Ten Years After, remember them as the boogie-rock band that shook up Woodstock with \\"I'm Going Home.\\" What a lot of people fail to realize is that they had a lot of other great tunes and some really killer albums too.<br /><br />Just not this one.<br /><br />A lot of Ten Years After fans consider this one their worst. I have to agree with them. Before the breakthrough of Ssssh, the band had 2 albums under their belt that were very promising. This album seems to break that promise. Most of the material sounds either uninspired, quiet, or just messed up. The first track, Going To Try, is very scizophrenic, as it doesn't decide where it wants to go. There are also 4 solo tracks by each member that are just filler tracks, nothing more. I do like the guitar solo piece just becuase it's a perfect beginning into their live version of I Just Can't Keep From Crying Sometimes. On this album, though, it just sounds dead and rambling.<br /><br />Other tracks like A Sad Song and No Title just don't seem to pick up at all. The highlights on this album are few and far-between. Woman Trouble, while not a very exciting track, is very reminiscent of the early jazz of Charlie Christian, Wes Montgomery, and Django Reinhardt. It's a good track on this cd, but compared to the rest of their catalogue, it's not that noticable. Hear Me Callin', though....great song. Very nice use of overdriven bass, with some fantastic rockabilly licks from Alvin. Also, Speed Kills is a wonderful fast 12-bar boogie that unfortunatly ends on a weird note.<br /><br />The bonus tracks don't add much either, except for the fantastic 14-minute Boogie On, which appeared on the compilation Alvin Lee and Friends in 1974.<br /><br />I wouldn't reccomend this album to first time Ten Years After listeners. Hell, I wouldn't reccomend it to diehards. 2 good songs does not make a good album. I'd say download the 3 good songs and burn them onto another Ten Years After album for a nice-rounded compilation. Avoid this one, it's a bit of a downer.of a downer.
075640407X|4.0|[Minor spoilers below]    Well, where to begin.... None of the characters were very likeable. Early in the story our protagonist Kvothe is revealed to be a sort of super-genius with a talent for music, magic, and anything else he decides to take up. What makes this insuferable is how comfortable he is with it. It seems as if every other page Kvothe is reminding the reader that he is stronger, smarter, and more talented than anyone else in the story. This gets old quickly. Even when he meets his nemesis I found it very hard to muster any sympathy for him. Then we have his \\"Fae\\" companion Bast. I don't know what the point of including him in the story was, but I honestly feel that it would have been a much better book without him. Its not very often when I come across a book where I absolutely hate a specific character, but in this case I hate Bast with a passion. Thankfully he was absent for most of the book, or I woud have been forced to stop reading.    Another thing that irked me were the parts where Kvothe says, \\"If you have never been poor, I don't expect you to understand\\" or \\"If you aren't a musician I don't expect you to understand\\". Please Mr. Rothfuss, spare me. The tone and language of these (which appear more than once throughout the book) reeks of self-indulgence.     Sadly, this book falls in the the trap of lavish food scenes. Every meal it seems, is an oppourtunity to tell the reader what the characters are eating and how delicious it is. I cannot describe to you how sick and tired I am of books with these food scenes. If it doesn't relate directly to the plot, I don't need to know about it. A simple, \\"so and so had dinner\\" would suffice.      Then there are parts where nothing seems to happen. For example, Kvothe's little expedition to an outlying town to investigate an appearance of the Chandrian. This seemingly has nothing to do with the rest of the book other than fill up space. It was tiresome and boring. Mr. Rothfuss had an oppourtunity to do something interesting with the Barrow Hill part, but instead decided to bore me with a convoulted romance sequence/dragon hunt.       Now, on to the things I liked.    Even though I hated the characters, pacing, and certain other aspects of the book I was absolutely thrilled with the world Mr. Rothfuss created. I cannot tell you how much I like the idea of magic as a science. It was a concept I was first introduced to in China Miéville's Perdido Street Station, and I am delighted to find it in this book as the science of Sympathy. The idea behind it and the following descriptions were well thought out and wonderful. Fantasy writers, get up on that.     I really hope that Mr. Rothfuss will continue to flesh out the University as I found it the most interesting part of the book. The different areas of study were a refreshing mix of conventional perceptions of magic, and modern science. I especially liked the description of the \\"Fishery\\" as a sort of medieval lab.     Another thing I really liked even though it only comprised a page of description was the book hunter. I like the idea of a vast library employing mercenaries to travel the world seeking out rare books to add to its collection. Again, I hope Mr. Rothfuss will continue to develop this concept in the sequels.     Even though one reviewer took issue with it, I like the main religion. Its a nice change of pace to have a religion in a fantasy book modeled after Christianity than a Pagan belief system. This makes The Name of the Wind stand out from other works of fantasy, and that can only be a good thing. I also liked the idea of using fire and iron as holy symbols. As far as I know that hasn't been done before, and it shows Mr. Rothfuss isn't afraid to go in a different direction from traditional fantasy.     In short, even though I didn't like the characters and the pacing was a bit off I was so enthralled with the world that I'm planning to buy the next book in the series when its released. I wouldn't let myissues with the main character deter you from buying this. I'm more of a fan of anti-heroes like Cugel in the Dying Earth series, Case in Neuromancer, Bellis from The Scar, etc. I like my protagonists with flaws, needs, and wants. Not perfect characters that always do the right thing. Although if this appeals to you I'm sure you'll love The Name of the Wind. However, if you don't like traditional hero characters you would probably be better off checking this out at the library.
0143038419|2.0|I regret saying this, but after about thirty pages, I found the book boring. The writing isn't bad, with some nice phrasing and some fun metaphors, but the author's obsession with herself becomes tiresome and comes across as a bit juvenile. I had to laugh at the descriptions of her experiences in the ashram: this is classic \\"bliss bunnyism.\\"  Once she's been engaged with contemplative practices for ten or so years, perhaps then she'll have something worth writing about. That this book, like \\"The Secret,\\" should top best seller lists makes me shudder.
1400063515|3.0|NNT´s use of a \\"narrative\\" strategy based on a questionable premise (did the sighting of the first black swan in Australia really impact the world?) to attract readers has paid dividends and his book has attained Grey Swan status among Amazon´s Business & Investing bestsellers. The author, as he admits, has clearly enjoyed the writing experience which, besides dealing with the Impact of the Highly Improbable, has enabled him to sideswipe individuals and groups he sees mired in a world of Gaussian illusion.     On reading the book for the second time I kept asking myself \\"is this new to me?\\" and, if it is, \\"what is its relevance to me?\\". On reviewing one´s own life to date, as the author recommends, it is clear that much of it has indeed been determined by high-impact unforeseeable events. This does not come as a great surprise - but then Taleb says that it never does, in retrospect! This contrasts with the chilling realization that there are almost certainly more such occurrences ahead. It is interesting to read explanations for why humans \\"don´t know they don´t know\\" they live in an extreme world but many, without realizing it, will already be familiar with psychological phenomena such as \\"platonism\\", \\"tunnelling\\", \\"confirmation bias\\" and the \\"narrative fallacy\\".       Interestingly, Taleb seems to miss what could well be the main reason why individuals \\"don´t know they don´t know\\": they just don´t want to know they don´t know they don´t know! It seems to be a natural human reaction to put one´s head in the sand when faced with the possibility of unforeseeable, high impact, possibly negative, events - particularly when they believe they can do nothing about them.       What, perhaps, is newer and more relevant to many is the fact that the professionals apparently rely on defective tools for analysing their particular piece of reality. Having some knowledge of the financial world and its questionable mathematical models, I can readily believe that many professionals - and even Nobel Prize winners - are led astray by the humble Bell Curve, as Taleb suggests. In fact the reasonably experienced small investor already has little faith in market \\"experts\\". On the other hand this same investor does not automatically transfer his scepticism to experts in other important fields, such as the social sciences, economics, environmental studies and military planning, where predictive errors can be far deadlier.    Besides peppering his text with the names and contributions of important thinkers - apparently a deliberate technique to achieve greater credibility - Taleb gives us some fascinating theory in the shape of non-linear relationships, the limitations of the Gaussian distribution, and the ability of so-called \\"power laws\\" to turn some Black Swans into Grey Swans. However this review stops a long way from demonstrating that life is largely determined by full-blooded (i.e. totally unpredictable) Black Swans.     Although I don´t think that Taleb will make us see our lives in a totally new light it is important that he reminds us - in case 24-hour world news ever allows us to forget - that day-to-day affairs can be subject to unforeseen, and potentially devastating, modification. He also offers us the flip side: some ideas on how we can take advantage of positive Black Swans. It may be due to a lack of imagination but, not being a venture capitalist or a \\"quant\\", I couldn´t immediately see measures of easy application in this area. Defence against Black Swans seems easier, namely diversification across very disparate fields. Taleb himself suggests a portfolio composed of up to 90% of extremely safe financial instruments (like Treasury bills) and as little as 10% in leveraged speculative bets like options (ideally involving \\"venture-capital style portfolios\\"). His general advise is more homely: learn to recognise undertakings exposed to positive and negative Black Swans, don´t be narrow minded, seize opportunities, be waryof government plans, etc.           Many interested in the impact of randomness will find the book a good, if fairly demanding, read. In the end, however, it is not entirely satisfactory. This has something to do with the fact that rather than be carried long by a limpid river of reasoning we are subjected to an avalanche of opinionative observations, some relevant, some less so. Some readers might also find many of the chapter and section headings irritating: \\"The Vagueness of Catherine´s Lover Count\\", \\"How many Wittgenstein´s can dance on the head of a pin?\\", etc. I suppose its all part of the relatively successful effort to make randomness fun. But although we´d enjoy seeing pompous academics and self-satisfied hedge-fund partners squirming with mice down their necks is it really necessary to rub the long-suffering French up the wrong way?
0374280967|4.0|The Uncommon Reader, like the author's The Clothes They Stood Up In, is short but sweet. Alan Bennett's quiet droll wit may not have you laughing out loud, but you will smile throughout the book.  The premise of the Queen of England becoming a--horrors!--reader is amusing, but by the end of the novella, she is about to start an activity even more subversive than reading....

Sure, fresh fruit or sorbet is fine, but what I really want are lemon bars, chocolate cake & the likes.  Please no more vegan carob chip & date oat cakes.    I tried several recipes including the chocolate cake, chocolate chip cookie, pumpkin pie, Mexican wedding cookie, chocolate mint cookie, bluberrry bundt cake, oatmeal raisin cookie, chocolate peanut butter bar, coffee cake, & cornbread-- ALL were amazingly delicious!

630264366X|5.0|Get past the stereotypes and historical inaccuracies (evil Nazis,  Peck's bewildering stage-Oirish accent, post-revisionist Papacy (re-revised towards the end of the film !!)), and immerse yourself in this powerfully scripted telling of how a rag-tag organization of escaped POWs, diplomats, Italian nobility, clergy, etc., worked to save Roman Jews, Allied servicemen and others in WWII Rome.    Three of the main characters, played by Peck, Plummer and Guilegud, each driven by his interpretation of \\"duty\\", weave a complex and credible tapestry of the beauty and complexity of being human.    This award-winning film is an often overlooked cinematic gem, recounting how ordinary people can achieve extraordinary outcomes, when a charismatic individual, Peck's character Mgr. O'Flaherty, provides the vision and leadership. Mgr. O'Flaherty's Jesuit training and Catholic clergy's penchant for dressing up both serve him well in his endeavours.    This movie predates other more widely acclaimed productions in the war-movie / drama genre (e.g. Schindler's List, Michael Collins) and is in my view superior.    Highly recommended and well worth seeing again (and again...)
B0000025P9|3.0|Toto IV is by far my favorite thing this band produced. In fact, really the only song by them I love that's not on this album is Hold The Line. Toto is a true studio musician all star assembly group, and their music is very professional, very solid, well produced, and generally flawless in execution. The music is commercial pop, with an 80s vibe, and ranges from ballads to... not \\"hard\\" rock but I guess I'd call it pop rock. The highlights are Steve Lukather's guitar solos and the vocals/harmonies. One of my favorite guitar solos of all time is in Rosanna. Ironicly, for being one of the world's best guitar players, Lukather holds back a lot with Toto I guess to help make the music more mainstream. If you want to check out Toto, or are a fan of their big hits, I'd say get IV over any \\"best of/greatest hits\\" compilations because this is their best stuff right here. Standout tracks: Rosanna, Make Believe, Africa.

Highly, highly recommended.

Maybe I just don't have the attention span required to listen to one song for two LP sides. For me, the radio-edit version found on Original Masters is better. My favorite things on this CD are the 11 minute live version recorded in New York City and the interview/commentary. I'll always keep this CD because it's considered a \\"must have\\" for Jethroheads, and I am a big fan of the band, but this is one of their albums I don't listen to very often.
B00005JPRD|5.0|\\"Across the Universe\\" is a stunning movie musical.  Comparisons to [[ASIN:B000077VR3 Moulin Rouge! (Widescreen Edition)]] are well-founded.  Julie Taymor, whose last film in 2002 was the visually stunning [[ASIN:B00005JLPK Frida]], brings those skills to this project.  Usually, American audiences have to go to Chinese cinema such as \\"Heroes\\" or \\"House of Flying Daggers\\" to see such visual creativity.  Also starring in this production is the incredible music of the Beatles that holds up well today, even the more lyrically challenging songs like \\"I Am the Walrus.\\"  I appreciated the way that the script used the songs to carry the story forward from the first opening song on the beach, \\"Is there anybody going to listen to my story all about a girl who came to stay\\" through to the end of the film.<br /><br />Taymor brings new faces to the screen who have been cast with a master eye since they fit so well and perform so brilliantly.  Lucy is played by Evan Rachel Wood who performed in one of my favorite films of 2005, [[ASIN:B00005JNP4 The Upside of Anger]].  She shows great range as an actress and is in good voice in the film.  Jude is played by Jim Sturgess who has acted in quite a few British TV shows.  He does a great job as the guy from across the ocean who comes and gives perspective to the cultural unrest during the Vietnam era.  Joe Anderson who played Henry Austen in [[ASIN:B00005JPST Becoming Jane]] plays Max Carrigan, Lucy's brother.  All three of the leads act and sing amazingly well.<br /><br />The supporting players are also a strong cast.  Newcomer Dana Fuchs plays Sadie, the landlady rock star.  Her rock numbers are show-stopping stunners.  JoJo the lead guitarist is played by Martin Luther McCoy.  T.V. Caprio does a good job as Prudence who comes in through the bathroom window.  Lucy's boyfriend who is killed in Vietnam is named Daniel and played by Spencer Liff who recently played in [[ASIN:B000W4KT64 Hairspray (Full-Screen Edition)]].  Rocker Joe Cocker plays the bum, the pimp & the mad hippie while U2's Bono plays the crazed Dr. Robert.  Eddie Izzard's talk/sing and inane additions to Mr. Kite were the only part of the film that didn't work so well for me, although visually it was stunning.<br /><br />The one sequence that resonated with me was when Max has to report for induction into the army.  The military strips the guys down to briefs or boxers; and they slide across conveyor belts.  This segues into one of the most stunning images of underwear-clad inductees tromping through the jungle carrying the Statue of Liberty on their backs.  The film achieves a universal appeal as we relate the war of yesterday to the war of today.  \\"Across the Universe\\" is an excellent piece of cinema, one I'm sure to want to play repeatedly when the DVD is released.

0517288796|5.0|I was sad to see the negative reviews aimed at this book because of the right-wing politics of the bad guys. The actual aims and accomplishments of the trio go far beyond currently accepted politics. For instance, the bad guys protect and encourage a person given to multiple rapes and assaults, and the presidential candidate supports forced sterilization of welfare recipients.<br /><br />If you can deal with that then you can enjoy a good Follett thriller. The bad guys are hoping that a takeover of the gene manipulation company that they own will make them $60 million each. For one, that will finance his run for president and for the others, riches far beyond anything they're used to. Unfortunately, the company has a well-hidden secret in its past that could torpedo the deal.<br /><br />Against the partners there is only Jeannie, who is unaware of the secret and is a junior lecturer studying identical twins raised apart. The announcement of the takeover is due in a week, and one of the bad guys at the beginning of the book wonders if the secret will ever be discovered in time to stop the takeover. Like him, I felt that there simply wasn't time for this to happen - the odds seemed too great.<br /><br />Add to this that one of the bad guys runs the department that Jeannie works in, and that another important person is wrongly arrested, and things look hopeless.<br /><br />However, this is where Follett's skill in plotting comes in. I find that his best thrillers (like Jackdaws) work with a short time period, like a week or a day. This book is no different and plot twists affect the book every few pages, it seems.<br /><br />It's pretty much impossible to go on without revealing some of the plot, so I'll stop here and recommend that you read this book. As someone who holds views similar to Ken Follett's (supporting the British Labour Party when I lived there) I had to look up his personal details on his web site to discover what his political views were. They're certainly not obvious from this book, which has a cast of many highly-believable characters, both good and bad.as a cast of many highly-believable characters, both good and bad.

B000001EGE|5.0|I bought this classic CD from Amazon recently (at a very attractive price). I bought the vinyl version more than 30 years ago, soon after it first came out.  A few of the songs survived the vinyl era on my self-recorded cassette tapes.  Since I got the CD, I've listened to \\"Honky Cat\\" countless times in the car, and copied it onto my laptop so I can listen to it inside too.<br /><br />Everyone knows the hit songs \\"Honky Cat\\" and \\"Rocket Man\\".  I remembered fondly the beautiful \\"tribute\\" to New York City, \\"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters\\" (it was actually a DB discussion of this song that brought the album back to mind), \\"Salvation\\", and the closing number (inspired by a rhino if you believe the CD notes), \\"Hercules\\" (Elton's stage middle name).  What surprised me were the other great songs I didn't remember so well--\\"Mellow\\" and \\"Susie (Dramas)\\", the latter of which has a chorus so great that they have to sing it three times--\\"She sure knows how to use me/pretty little black-eyed Susie/playing hooky with my heart all the time/Livin with her funky family/in a derelict old alley/down by the river where we share a little lovin' in the moonshine.\\" I'm gonna sing at least one of these at Karaoke some night.<br /><br />The album also brought back to mind the seamless songwriting collaboration of Elton and his lyricist Bernie Taupin, who did not play or sing with the band.  I'm told that Taupin wrote the lyrics (poems) and Elton wrote the tunes around them.  On \\"Honky Chateau\\", an album that was primarily recorded in France, the producer filled out the sound with an exciting electric violin, used very effectively on \\"Mellow\\" and \\"Amy\\".  Elton's piano composition and playing is fabulous as always.  Listening again to \\"Honky Chateau\\" makes me understand why Elton John became a pop music phenomenon.

Magical.
1590171993|2.0|This book is difficult to talk about. I can see very well why it's not popular and why it's not ranked with the likes of Joyce and Tolstoy. The main character, William Stoner, is basically eviscerated emotionally, from start to finish. I wished as I read this well-written book to just shake this character, inject some life into him, get him to talk, to lose his inhibitions, to show some raw emotion. Instead, we see a shy, diffident soul speaking in strangled half sentences and broken words, and living mainly in his mind. In fact, it's a stretch of my imagination to view this character as an actual college professor relating to real students. His marriage is awful. His wife Edith is an untouchable block of ice who seems to be ever on the borderline of a nervous breakdown. And his daughter Grace is disengaged completely from the \\"family.\\" At last Stoner finally comes to life in his forties, only to be cruelly shut down again. So other than the cool and careful writing style, which kept me reading, and the intrigues and politics of academia, there's a fundamental problem here. Joyce and Tolstoy created full people. We understood everything about them. Here in the center of this book we have a stultifying character, and we don't really understand why he is that way. This emotional strain and lack of insight left this reader fundamentally unsatisfied.<br />Stoner, according to the author in the book's introduction, was a hero because he was totally devoted to his job and to the tradition of teaching, no matter what. The author also feels that literature should be a joyful experience, not something to be analyzed to death. Sadly for me, I just can't relate to what John Williams has created here.

B0000B1OFL|3.0|\\"The Italian Job\\" is a heist movie.  To some extent, if you've seen one of these (especially the ur-heist film \\"Rififi\\"), you've seen them all.  Hey, if you've ever watched a movie, you know that when a master thief makes \\"one last score\\" before retirement, things are going to go horribly wrong.  It's just like being a cop in a movie two weeks before retirement.  \\"The Italian Job\\" does not transcend any expectations, but it doesn't fail to meet any of them, either.  The performances are good, and the script makes as much sense as you would expect it to.  The action sequences are well-done, and there are enough car chases to remind you of the Golden Age of car chases in the 70s and early 80s.  In the end, while it is a decent movie, there is really nothing memorable about it, other than the cars.  \\"The Italian Job\\" is a decent rental; you will likely not be disappointed, and you may even have a good time with it.  But it's just not distinctive or memorable enough to add to your permanent collection.
B000QXDED6|1.0|300: AN OPPORTUNITY BUNGLED    Here was an opportunity to convey a genuine message about liberty, resistance to tyranny and self sacrifice in the cause of freedom. It is the story of how Western Civilization was nearly extinguished, virtually at birth, by the might of Oriental Despotism. Xerxes, the Persian King of Kings, threatened to overwhelm the tiny Greek city states with a vast army, thus putting a premature end to Western Civilization: before Socrates, Plato and Aristotle; before Dante, Shakespeare and Milton; before Melville, Dickens Dostoyevsky, and Conrad; before Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, Darwin and Einstein; before Christianity, the Reformation, the Enlightenment and the Declaration of Independence; before the emergence of individual liberty, equality of opportunity, the rule of law, and the private ownership of property; before the abolition of slavery and the emancipation of women - all products of Western Civilization.    But for the heroic stand of a handful of Greek soldiers who fought to preserve the freedom of their polis, all of this would have been aborted before it could come into existence.     Now, after 2,500 years, Hollywood has managed to trivialize one of the great turning points of civilization. The story of the 300 Spartans at Thermopylae has been turned into just another horror flick, with all the usual artificial monsters and leaping, prancing cartoon super heroes. As usual, the lesson is lost in the special effects.    Hollywood today seems incapable of making an historical drama without trivializing it. It cannot make a comedy without smut, a war movie without confusing good and evil, a mystery without turning it into a morass of contradiction and confusion, a thriller without an interminable and boring car chase. It cannot make a romantic movie because it no longer believes in the possibility of real love. It no longer knows how to tell a story, or how to end one. And it cannot make any kind of movie at all without infecting it with politics, political correctness and moral equivalence.     From the 1930s to the 1950s Hollywood turned out hundreds of fine movies every year. Even the so called B (for budget) movies were generally intelligent, entertaining and often inspiring.  Today it would be miraculous if Hollywood managed to produce two or three such films a year (Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List and Something the Lord Made come to mind).     The movie industry since the 1970s is incapable of producing movies as consistently excellent as Random Harvest or Mrs. Miniver; Casablanca, 12 O'Clock High or Sands of Iwo Jima; Paths of Glory, The Fighting 69th or Sergeant York; The Seventh Cross or They Came to Cordura; Gone With the Wind  or For Whom the Bell Tolls; High Noon or Bad Day at Black Rock; Dial M for Murder, Little Caesar,  House of Strangers or The Treasure of the Sierra Madre; It's a Wonderful Life or The Best Years of Our Lives; To Kill a Mockingbird or Gentleman's Agreement; The Last Hurrah, Moby Dick, The Sea Wolf or The African Queen -- to mention only a handful of the great films of the past.     Instead, it turns out rivers of junk.     For a really worthwhile movie about Leonidas and the Battle of Thermopylae see The 300 Spartans (1962, starring Richard Eagan). Not a great movie; but a good and a true one.

Even songs I'm not fond of off that album have a very nice tone and performance value that had me nodding my head and actively engaged the whole time.  And the special guests make this DVD even better.  Bowie's rendition of Comfortably Numb makes the original look like a demo-tape.  Bowie interpreted this classic Floyd-Staple and made it gold.  I still can't believe that at 60+ years Gilmour still plays the guitar like some golden angel from the cosmos.  Each note is hand-selected to resonate on various muscles and tendons connecting your spine to the base of the skull (read: Hair-raisingly good).  I enjoyed this every bit as much as I enjoyed Pulse.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|What some reviewers and those critics in the rock music scene have failed to understand with this newest release by the boys of Linkin Park is that the band have reached out and experimented with their sound and possible new directions of their music. Whilst the previous album Meteora was and is always going to be their best work, they have seen that creating a sound that is repetitious and the same would in time kill their fame. Like it or not, things change, people do and so do bands. Without change we wouldn't have the best that the music industry offers day in and day out.<br /><br />'Minutes To Midnight' is a album of shared personal experience on the tour road and their own personal touches. The back artcover of the album simply is astonishing and proves the point that the five are looking out into the ocean, to see what a 'tomorrow' will bring. True, I will agree with some reviewers that some of the songs in this album sound like ballads. However, I am a fan of lyrics and the lyrics in these songs are meaningful.<br /><br />The songs that are my favourites and are played religiously are 'Shadow Of The Day', 'What've I Done', 'In Between' and 'Bleed It Out'. I for one have enjoyed the more mellow music of Linkin Park that for me show more of a experimentation and has made me get closer to this band. Sure, you should maybe listen 2 or 3 times to this album before you start appreciating it, as I have.<br /><br />Overall Linkin Park should be applauded for experimenting and letting go with new sounds. Their next album will be that much better for this experimentation.
0316067598|5.0|I wish i could force every young and old american to read this story. Especially the liberal left who shun war and especially those who probably have never met a warrior Seal.  The main point for me was how ridiculous  and gutless are the \\"rules 0f engagement\\" If this book doesnt mobilize the young men of this country,  nothing will. I should be required reading
B000NDIAWY|5.0|She has a rare voice that carries well over a mix of folk and rock songs.  my favorite song is Turpentine, although The Story may be more famous.  Definitely Recommend this album. I liked it better than her other album, which leans more heavily towards folk and country music.    If you like Sarah Mclachlan, and other female artists with husky voices and soulful melodies, this is a great album.     also try and get her Hallelujah song from the Itunes store. (it's not in the CDs) It's mesmerizing.
B000B8QG4A|2.0|The DVD arived on time and in good condition however it is not what is portrayed in the description.  The DVD package has no slipcover as indicated in the image. Instead it came wrapped in plastic with the words \\"made in Mexico\\" printed in blue letters. Although the DVD case is of good quality, it is not a true Disney DVD case which becomes obvious when compared to real Disney DVD cases. The discs have a \\"raised\\" printed image; a true Disney DVD is perfectly smooth. The overall quality isn't bad at all. However what I wanted was the real thing.  This is not a real collectable as the image shown implied. If I had known that, I wouldn't have bought it.

This is Absolutely Live, Alive She Cried and Hollywood Bowl wrapped into one happy package...one of the few instances The Doors repackaging crew got something right because \\"Alive\\" and \\"Hollywood\\" were available for only a few years prior to this package.      Why Elektra or The Doors Camp decided to go back to Absolutely Live a few years after In Concert was issue, I'll never know...but go figure...it's The Doors catalog and it hasn't made much sense since \\"Gold Mine\\" (1972) except with this one and the Perception box.  Get this one because it's one of the few where they get it right.

0143038419|1.0|Sorry..have to agree with the negative reviews here. i just couldnt finish the book even though there were just a few pages left. It was too self-indulgent for me ....and frankly, just another tiring saga in the American women's seemingly endless quest for self-discovery and self-indulgence. E. Gilbert is just another  clever chik-lit writer who has smartly sensed female angst among the divorced/single/bored wife crowd and has capitalized on it. For all her talk about spiritual quest, the author seemed like someone who was just plain bored with her marriage, whose medication wasnt working, and who simply needed a dose of good sex to find ultimate nirvana.   When asked in an interview if dumping her husband and pushing off wasnt selfish, here is what Ms. Gilbert had to say:  \\"What is it about the American obsession with productivity and responsibility that makes it so difficult for us to allow ourselves a little time to solve the puzzle of our own lives, before it's too late?\\"  This statement alone tells so much. A responsibility towards a marriage and spouse is considered an unwanted \\"obsession\\" and one's own pursuit of happiness supercedes everything else? If a man decided to dump his wife and family to flee to the Himalayas to meditate we wouldnt be calling it a spiritual journey...we would call it irresponsibility. If Americans in the suburbs want to find God, they can start by becoming decent, responsible human beings themselves. God would prefer that to scrubbing floors and sitting crosslegged in ashrams.  Its little surprise that none of my male colleagues date American women labeling them \\"high maintenance\\" Thank God my hubby didnt feel that way:-). Interesting that none of my friends liked this book and they include both conservative and liberal types!

0385493622|5.0|The book presents the history of number theory, starting from Pythagoras and culminating with Andrew Wiles, the mathematician who solved Fermat's Last Theorem. The author explains, for example, how and why negative and imaginary numbers were introduced, and sometimes throws in a riddle for the reader to solve (the answer is in the appendix). You don't need to know advanced mathematics in order to understand this book, since the author does a good job at explaining things in a way that everybody understands. Along the way, he gives an insight on the life of the great mathematicians, some of which are tragic. Good read, I highly recommend it!!!

B000ILYYJE|5.0|The Doors' music may have been repackaged as often as that of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.  This set, which is also available with CDs only, replaces an earlier box set of all six albums, this time adding extra tracks.  These \\"bonus\\" tracks are mostly alternate takes that are not especially interesting, although there are a couple of songs that were not included on the original six albums.<br /><br />For those who already own the CDs, the real appeal is the surround sound DVDs.  LA Woman was issued on DVD-Audio several years ago, but as that format died out due to poor marketing and competition with Super Audio CD, none of the other five Doors albums were available in surround sound, until now.<br /><br />For me, that's worth the price.  The extra tracks are nice to have; the new packaging is good; the video content is OK (but all of it's available on other DVDs); but the surround sound mixes, by original engineer Bruce Botnick, allow you to hear this 40-year-old music in new dimensions.  The surround mixes won't replace the originals, and aren't intended to, but you do hear detail that you won't hear in the two-track mixes, and it's an enthralling experience, almost like hearing these classic albums for the first time.<br /><br />The price is a bit high, but you're getting six CDs and six DVDs, so it's not exactly a ripoff.  If you don't have surround sound equipment, the DVDs won't do much for you, and you might want to pick up the CD-only set.<br /><br />Overall this is an excellent package, although most of the people who might want to buy it already own these albums, and are therefore paying for something they already own.  I'd recommend this mostly for those who want the surround sound mixes.

B000BTNIHW|5.0|I bought one of these to hold spare fuel for a lighter and small hand warmer.  I was surprised at how well it is constructed.  The reservoir isn't huge, but has enough to fill a lighter 2 or three times, and a hand warmer once.  There are two seals that prevent leakage, I've had no problems with leakage, but I attached the sections firmly.
B0002OERI0|4.0|I don't like Green Day. I don't really know what possessed me to purchase this album from a band who I cannot relate to, is much younger than me and writes songs with explicit lyrics which really turns me off. Somehow the subliminal messages of \\"Buy Me\\" worked and I bought this CD. I love it! I have to admit I like every song on it and the \\"Novacaine Song\\" is so good, I can't get enough of it! I don't know how these guys did it, but I'll gladly buy another album from Green Day if they continue on this path. Well done boys! - Ciao
0446677450|2.0|This was not a very good self-help type of program. Usable advice, enthusiasm, and some worthy points make it average, but it hardly reflects the title.  Sorry guys, I'd pass on this one.  Read Cyber-Psychonetics instead.
0618477977|5.0|I bought this for my sister who is a 2nd grade teacher.  She gave it to an underprivileged child in her room.  The child was amazed at how beautiful the drawings were...she said she was the luckiest child in the world.  This book made my Christmas!
080701429X|5.0|This book is deceptively small, but incredibly deep, and probably unmatched anywhere in literature...(that I have ever read at least). The first part is a stark autobiography of Frankl's personal journey through the Holocaust. It is powerful, compelling and harrowing.. this story is now familiar, but Frankl tells it with immense compassion and dignity. A Google search reveals that this book has not been invited into a certain Holocaust museum (?), but one would assume it is because Frankl's philosophy, which he outlines in the second part of the book, which is borne from his personal search for meaning in the darkest days of WW2, achieved a transcendence of Self that went beyond the labelling of Jew and Nazi. I found his exposition of logotherapy fascinating, with golden threads of thought that I could unwind with more current day psychological schematas, such as those propounded in NLP and Psychosynthesis. As a primer on the theory of Existentialism and an introduction to existential therapy, which he helped to form, I would also thoroughly recommend this book.
0061120081|5.0|\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is more than a classic, it is heartbreakingly beautiful.  Like a previous reviewer, it had been 40 years since my first reading in the sixties. While it was affecting then, it was even more so now. Perhaps maturity enables us to appreciate a great work of art in a way that callow youth cannot.      If you have read it before, read it again.  If you have never read it, do so without delay.  I promise you an emotional experience that will never leave you.
B000RP4LEO|3.0|French Martha Argerich?<br />What a lark! I was thinking - even Argerich did NOT record No. 5. Why did Grimaud? She hasn't got the prowess and stamina to play No. 5. The opening arpeggios are evident that this reading is way below the voltage required of this work.<br />Having heard Paul Lewis and another young Chinese pianist Sun Yingdi playing this piece live recently before I heard this CD, I was sharply taken aback by Ms Grimaud's tempo as well as lack of nuances.<br />She has got ALL the essential elements regarding the composition - a mature pianist, to be sure.<br />But what she sadly lacks is the technical prowess and the power of expression. The opening arpeggios, played to great thrust of beauty by Lewis and Sun, is nowhere paralled by Grimaud. And mind you, Sun Yingdi is but a young pianist who won an international competition in Utrecht in 2005 (the Liszt Piano Competition) and just beginning to start his career as a performing artist. He, however, has the requisite technique and power to play this piece.<br />Jurowski and the State Orchestra of Dresden, on the other hand, are immaculate in their orchestration. Jurowski, in particular, has in mind a grandiose and deeply moving reading of this piece. But alas, he CANNOT play the solo. One easily hears the frustration he has when partnering the ever-too-slow Grimaud in the opening movement. The two are hardly in sync.<br />The choice of this recording by her is a clear mistake.<br />Postcript:<br />On the prompting of Santa Fe Listener's review, I gritted my teeth and went on to the 2nd and the 3rd movements of No. 5. Yea, Grimaud's touching is brittle and nimble, overall lacking sadly in lyricism. The otherwise beautiful second movement became almost a 'bang bang' game. Not slightly better is the 3rd movement, where again a lack of technical prowess sadly surfaced.<br />The sonics and orchestration, however, are truly great by comparison to other DG's productions, foremost coming to mind is Lang Lang's recent Beethoven No. 1 and 4, and the Rachmaninoff Concerto No. 2.<br />For the orchestra and conductor, I would have gladly given 3 stars overall, but as it is, an over-generous rating may not fully reflect the grave disappointment felt in listening to this otherwise technologically perfect recording.cent Beethoven No. 1 and 4, and the Rachmaninoff Concerto No. 2.<br />For the orchestra and conductor, I would have gladly given 3 stars overall, but as it is, an over-generous rating may not fully reflect the grave disappointment felt in listening to this otherwise technologically perfect recording.
1577314808|5.0|I never believed in spiritual \\"mumbo-jumbo\\" I have been and am still very practical, realistic and rational person. However one day I experienced spirit (alive peace within) accidentally and recognized that that's what I truly am. However my mind got very scared of that experience and I decided to forget all about it and carry on my life as usual.      However a lingering reminder and longing for that peace remained. Now I am in a stage where that longing can no longer be ignored or denied. My mind got confused with lot of questions and I found myself split internally. This book \\"The power of Now\\" literally found me and reached me exactly at the time I needed it.     Looking at title \\"Step by step guide to enlightenment\\", my mind smiled and said \\"how can enlightenment be described as step by step thing to do. This is absurd.\\"   But as I read it, it made a lot of sense, I would see my mind getting quieter as I read and my spirit taking over. Every statement resonated as truth to the real me. Reading this book had effect of deep meditation to me.  I feel shift in my level of consciousness after reading and practicing the teachings.    This book is to be read with spirit / awareness / presence / consciousness. If you read with mind alone, you will miss the point, find it repetitive and boring.  If you have  had experienced your true essence or have an intuitive feel that there is more to you than just mind in a bag of skin then this book will make sense to you and accelerate process of awakening.    After reading this book I also recommend book \\"A new earth ..\\" by same author.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|Five reasons to buy this classic:  1. It showcases John Belushi at the peak of his meteoric comedic run.  2. Good to own because it's still hilarious after all these years and stands up to repeated viewings.  3. Along with Stripes and Caddyshack, it's one of the most quotable comedies of all time. [Other fans will happily play along and non-fans will be annoyed.]  4. Some gratuitous nudity. [Thank you very much.]  5. Great soundtrack. You'll see why \\"Shout\\" has been played at every wedding reception you've been to in the last 20 years.
0805079831|1.0|Boo hoo, whine, moan...I love all these previous reviewers, New York leftists who disparage their country, then leave their offices to enjoy the fat of the land, the superior wares, doctors and medicines that capitalism has given them. Geez this book is a sorry polemic if I've ever read one. It took all my power to slog through it. Attention haters of capitalism: what you strive for will never come about, you had your shot with communism; it only worked with barbed wire and machine guns. You had your shot with socialist/statist economies in Europe, which is now rotting and drowning in its own social commitments (and about to become part of the greater Muslim world.) Capitalism is the only efficient way to bring out the best in mankind's nature and genius. No, Limbaugh, Fox News, and Lou Dobbs are not problems; this book, and ones like it are the problem.
0307120007|5.0|At first my daughter was not very impressed with this book...the pictures aren't as compelling as in some of her other books. But as she's gotten older, the interactive details of this book have really made this one of her favorites. She talks and laughs at the characters for a good 20 minutes at a time. And anyone with an active 1 year old knows how impressive that is! Its sturdy design (double-folded cardboard pages) also make it fairly destroy-proof, though I'm sure there's a baby out there that will find a way!
B000002PCS|5.0|A very good friend asked me what film sound track was my all time favourite.<br /><br />What an impossible question.<br /><br />Harking back to all the films and music having seen and heard, one soundtrack comes to mind.<br /><br />\\"Somewhere in Time\\", combined with Rachmaninov's Paganini Rhapsody Variation No. 18, and John Barry's original soundtrack that eerily connects and sounds almost a part of Racmaninov's beautiful Rhapsody of love, instantly came to me, when viewing the film again.<br /><br />A sentimental story of true love traversing across time, a beautiful novel by John Matheson, who also wrote the screenplay, and had a cameo appearance in the film combined with the Russian romantic's most heart-felt sonata and John Barry's beautiful soundtrack, really is the perfect back drop to this unusual tale of time crossed lovers'. It is music that expresses beautiful sadness.<br /><br />Some have said that \\"Somewhere in Time\\" and most of Rachmaninov's music is too sentimental bordering on mawkishness. I've always thought that the Russian Pianist's music is, for the most part, tragic, however never sentimental. The novel, originally titled, [[ASIN:0899665144 Bid Time Return]] by Matheson is a much sadder story, more tragic than the film in many ways. Although the film is still tragic as all good love stories should be.<br /><br />If you enjoy beautiful music, the soundtrack to \\"Somewhere in Time\\" would be an excellent addition to your music library.
0374105235|5.0|I feel a little odd giving 5 stars to a book with such horrific subject matter.  The fact is, the author has written such a clear account of all that happened in his life that I was physically affected by some of the chapters I read.  No child should ever have to witness much less participate in the events that happened in Sierra Leone (or any war torn country).  Beah is a true survivor.  I think everyone NEEDS to read this book.
1567184855|5.0|WOW. Few words can describe how I felt while reading this book.     As someone who felt imprisoned by organized religion my whole life, but whose spiritual sense left me disappointed and unconvinced by Dawkins, Harris, and others in the atheist camp, this book had answers -- real answers that made logical sense. Would it pass the validation test required by scientific method? Of course not. But it resonates with me as truth in every way that religion does not.     If you are in a boat similar to me - cynical of organized religion, but knowing that there is a spiritual world out there, this book will change the way you see the world, and provide insights for personal growth.     Thank you, Dr. Newton - your writings are a gift.
B0000UJL96|4.0|With the previous two Star Trek films being the weakest so far in the series (in my humble opinion), this next film really had no choice but to be better. And in fact, this film was better, much better. Good enough to give Star Trek II a run for its money as being the best of the Star Trek films. Finally, we have a classic Star Trek plot involving the long time villainous Klingons attempting to make peace with the Federation and non-trusting Kirk and crew are sent to collect a Klingon chancellor so he may meet with Federation members on Earth, however when the chancellor is assassinated, Kirk and company are blamed and held as prisoners. Thankfully, the humor that was predominate in previous films was cut down to a great deal, and the original crew seems wonderfully in sync again. Nicolas Meyer (who directed Wrath of Khan) returns to the director's chair to pilot the original Star Trek crew's last adventure, and does an excellent job. And though Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner gave good efforts as directors of the previous 3 Star Trek films, Meyer brings something more to the series, or perhaps he just has good timing of showing up and directing these movies when there actually a good story behind them. In any case, this is a good film and a wonderfully fitting end for the original Star Trek crew. If you're like me, and felt that the last couple of Star Trek films had dropped the ball, you should be happy to know that this one picks the ball back up and runs with it!!! Its a definite buy, and all the great special features included with it, is just icing on the cake as far as I'm concerned!!
0316067598|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The author gave the perception that he was honest, and thoughtful.  I would recommend this book to anyone.
B0000AUHOH|3.0|After seeing what I considered the worst Star Trek movie thus far in the series (Part IV), I had my hopes that this film would bounce back with good results. Well, I can't stay that this film is the best one in the series, or even one of the best ones, but it is slightly better than the cheesy Star Trek IV. Yes, the plot has its problems, but at least its not about saving whales!!! The basic storyline is that a renegade Vulcan (who ends up being Spock's half-brother) steals the Enterprise and travels to the center of the Universe in hopes to find God himself!!! Yeah, not what you call a great plot, but again, at least theres no whales!!! But don't worry, this film still has some of the humor that Part IV was smothered with. Though most of it comes in the first few opening scenes with Kirk, Spock, and McCoy camping out during shore leave. Here we have Kirk, who's had to be pushing 60 by then, climbing a side of a cliff and Spock with rocket shoes on. The scene where Kirk and McCoy attempt to teach Spock to sing \\"Row, Row, Row Your Boat\\" is especially painful. We also have a close to 55 year old Nichelle Nichols doing a \\"striptease\\" dance, and implications that her and Scotty were romantically involved. Just the plot overall has too many holes in it, and the ending was just plain disappointing and unclear in the fact that there is no indication on what or who this entity (whom they first thought was infact, God) was or if it was really destroyed. Also, the crew themselves really start to show their age in this one and the special effects were mediocre at best.  This time, instead of Leonard Nimoy directing, none other than William Shatner himself directs this one. And though I've seen much better directed films, I think Shatner did a much better job than given credit for. Nevertheless, there are many more things wrong with this movie than right. I read one of the other reviews saying that this was more like an episode than a movie, and I agree. If this one would have been an old original episode, I would have probably loved it, but to be a feature film, the plot just suffers, and there's too much feeble attempts at humor that ultimately, just hurt the film even worse. Obsessed Star Trek fans may still find some solstice in this one, but for more realistic fans, I just don't feel that this film makes the grade. Still, its worth owning and watching a handful of times, and a must have in order to complete your Star Trek film series collection.been an old original episode, I would have probably loved it, but to be a feature film, the plot just suffers, and there's too much feeble attempts at humor that ultimately, just hurt the film even worse.

B000E1MTXQ|3.0|The first sequel to a successful movie is always iffy. So many have fallen by the wayside, and sequels don't hold much credibility these days, with CGI and gimmicky concepts, especially when Hollywood is churning them when they're not even necessary.<br /><br />But Bourne Identity needed a sequel, to carry on the story of Jason Bourne, to see if he recovers anymore of his memory. Two years after the first finished, Jason & Marie are in India, living off the grid, enjoying life and each other. Until something tragic happens, and Jason is once more on the run, running from himself, and discovering on the way, that he's been framed for two murders. He's still having recurring nightmares, and is still trying to piece together his former life.<br /><br />The action scenes are absolutely stunning, an amazing follow up to Identity, with an even better car chase than the original, in a taxi, which soon gets wrecked. Bourne even surpasses himself, when in Identity, he fought an enemy with a pen, he now fights an enemy with a rolled up newspaper!<br /><br />I'm still disappointed at Julia Stiles' screen time in this, a gripe which has carried on from Identity. While she has marginally more screen time than the first, it's still not enough for a great actress as she is, trying to spreak her wings past her teenage film roles. Brian Cox has a little bit more revealed about his character, and all is not what it seems with him!<br /><br />Supremacy is an excellent follow up to an already excellent original movie, and I look forward to seeing exactly what happens to Bourne in Ultimatium. I hope everything is resolved nicely. It's quite strange, because the end of Ultimatium is actually shown at the end of Supremacy, a strange tactic, but something that leaves the viewers wanting more.
6305433909|5.0|I saw this movie when I was a substitute teacher.  I could feel Whoopi Goldberg's Sister Mary Clarence when she first walked into that out of control classroom.  The blatant disrespect they showed her was realistic.      The way she gained the class's respect made me pay attention.  It was what you would hope a good teacher would do.  As a matter of fact, the class and the teacher in this movie were based on a real teacher and her music class. I remember seeing the real teacher and her class on a talk show in 1995.      But the class in the movie had Lauryn Hill.  She lit up the screen as the attitudinal Rita Watson.  Her mother, portrayed by Sheryl Lee Ralph, had much to do with the Rita's poor attitude, we later find out.  Yet somehow, Sister Mary Clarence is able to get through to Rita and she is able to do what she does best--sing.      The singing in this movie is phenomenal!  The musical arrangements took this movie to another level than the original movie.  In fact, the scenes with just the nuns singing are flat and dull by comparison to the scenes with the teenagers.      There's a line in the movie, \\"What she's done with those children is nothing short of miraculous.\\"  You get caught up in that `miraculous' watching the movie.  And you laugh.  And you cry.  And you want to watch it again and again and again.  That's why Sister Act 2 is one of the 7 happiest black movies of all time.
1567184855|5.0|I bought this book and Destiny of Souls 2 years ago and was fascinated by the information;  Already being a hypnotherapist who has done numerous past life regressions, I was intrigued to experience a session with Dr Michael Newton;  unfortunately I found out he'd retired several years ago.  However, the material in the book so piqued my curiosity that I found a person who does the sessions, and the experience was even more amazing than I'd imagined.  All the details in the book actually came to life;   it's one thing to read an amazing researchers notes; however, when I found out they were the tip of the iceberg I have to say:  Dr Michael Newton has stumbled onto the ability to enter the pearly gates so to speak, and as he describes it himself, he had no idea where his clients were going and he just had to observe and let them tell him what they were experiencing.  This book is truly amazing, and that is an understatement!!!!   The most astounding fact is that Dr Michael Newton was able to help anyone who wanted the experience.   So if the book is amazing;  then how to describe the actual experience of going there.......priceless!!!!!!   Great work Dr Newton, this is the only book of it's kind anywhere in the world I've ever heard of.   Someone mentioned to me it was a sort of Shamanic Journey; however, I've done several of them and this is so much more profound and loving.  Again, you've hit the spiritual mother-lode.  And had the compassion to share your findings.   Congratulations!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Okay, this movie has great animation, is fun for the whole family, etc., etc.<br /><br />The real reason to love this movie is the story.  This is one of the best stories that I have seen on the Big Screen in years.  The characters are well developed and enjoyable.  The plot moves along at a steady pace with enough twists and turns to keep you interested without jarring your sense of believabilty.  Characters move and transform in endearing and logical ways.<br /><br />I can't wait to get the DVD so that I can watch this film over and over again.
0307386872|4.0|One of Austen's first books to be published, Sense and Sensibility tells the story of the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne. Having lost their father, they had to start life anew, since their half-brother and his wife were not willing to take care of them. So Elinor, Marianne, their mother and younger sister move to Barton Cottage. In their new home, they experience heartache and pain as they mature and grow.<br /><br />Elinor, the elder sister is extremely sensible, even in matters of the heart. When she learns that Edward Ferrars, the man whom she loved, was going to marry Lucy Steele, she takes it in stride. She is sad, but that does not slow her down. Marianne, on-the-other-hand, is very dramatic and emotional. When Mr. Willoughby breaks her heart, she decides she is never going to recover. She starts getting sick often and being melancholy. The story ends well, but both sisters learn to become less rigid in their respective personalities. Elinor realizes that showing emotions is alright and Marianne decides that living life in the past is not useful. Hence, Elinor gains some sensibility and Marianne some sense.<br /><br />Once again, Austen has outdone herself in this novel. Her characters are well-developed. Like in her other novels, Austen's writing paints a charming picture of the life and times of the 19th Century English. The story line is very captivating and Austen goes into great detail describing every aspect. However, it seems that towards the end she wraps everything up very quickly. She mentions Lucy Steele and Willoughby's whereabouts and feelings; she mentions Elinor's and Marianne's respective marriages. She does this without using her usual descriptive language. But other than her ending, this is an excellent novel.<br /><br />Armchair Interviews says: If you have not read Austen before, Sense and Sensibility is the novel to start with!

0307386864|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is probably the most well-read book written by Jane Austen.<br /><br />The story revolves around the Bennet family that has five daughters, and a mother seeking to get them married to rich men. Elizabeth Bennet, the energetic and charming second daughter, is the main focus and heroine in the novel. She meets rich and stuck-up (or so she thinks) Mr. Darcy at a ball, starting a very interesting, and tumultuous relationship. Upon their first meeting Elizabeth and Darcy lets prejudice cloud their impression of each other. And later on, both were too prideful to correct the other's wrong assumption. Hence, the title Pride and Prejudice.<br /><br />This novel can be aptly considered a classic since readers have always been fascinated with the in and outs of the relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy. But other than the captivating story line, Austen also writes wonderful descriptions depicting the 19th century life of people in England. Even though her description without dialogue may seem long, her subtle humor makes it lively and interesting to read. Seeing its success, it is hard to imagine that Pride and Prejudice was rejected by publishers initially.<br /><br />Armchair Interviews says: If you have not read this book, you are missing out on a great novel.
1587990717|5.0|Just a couple of small points...    First, as many have indicated, Fooled By Randomness is a bit of a prelude to The Black Swan, so I, too, highly recommend reading them in order. Reading the former is good preparation for the latter.    Second, I happened to start Fooled By Randomness having just finished with A Mountain Of Silence, an exposition of Eastern Orthodox wisdom, and what a supreme coincidence it was! For me, Taleb's message that we underestimate randomness, that a lot more things are out of our control than we think, that we insist on creative reasoning to assuage ourselves that we can explain and predict events, that we should 'tinker', and that we should live aesthetically with a view to improving ourselves, is perhaps intuitive to an 'Eastern' mind, but a different way of thinking in the West.
B000ICL3KG|3.0|I must say that there are a lot of negative reviews to this, which just does not make sense. Al Gore is not saying anything new, but has merely packaged and presented the concept of 'global warming' very nicely. As a politician, that is his job.<br />Now for the people who feel Global Warming is a farce, don't make your judgements based on what you feel is not right about this documentary, but on rather something more substantial. It highlights the lack of a deeper understanding of this issue at large.<br />Its controversial, yes. It has industry/ economic ramifications, yes. But it cannot be overlooked or brushed aside.<br />Now for the people who write reviews more as a political attack, well it is still your personal opinion. But taking into consideration that people like Al Gore highlight a \\"sort-of\\" correct issue on global warming than a person like Michael Moore who does his documentaries for 'personal growth'..??<br />--Good Side, Bad Side, Ugly Side--  whatever side to this. I appreciate the way Al gore presented this topic, it shows the man's confidence, panache, charisma and surety about himself and conviction about what he is speaking about. Yes he is a politician, your right..  you think dubya can pull this off??? it would be more of a stand-up.<br />Recommend to rent, any future realization on what you should be doing to save the environment will be the difference to reactive/ proactive troubleshooting.<br /><br />Have a nice breath!
B000UR366S|2.0|I have to say, Joni Mitchell is my favorite songwriter of all time and there were many moments in my life where her albums literally got me through. I think I know every lyric of every song she ever wrote. But this one is just too much. I realize that she is getting older and the world looks bleak, but, really, who wants to listen to this? I can see a couple songs about the end of the world, and \\"If I Had a Heart\\" has some nice lyrics, but I really do feel like jumping out a window and ending it all after listening to this CD. I wish there was more hope in it. Or some optimism for the great work people are doing all over the world to try and end suffering, violence, environmental degradation, poverty, etc. Why not write about the good things in life--the new multiculturalism perhaps, or dip into some world music--just don't give us this. I think Joni ought to stop writing songs if this is what she's really feeling.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|This album is a great follow-up to their debut album. It's nice to hear actual rock music.
B00004XONN|5.0|I got into Radiohead a year or two ago and they have since become one of my favorite bands. Every album they have put out has been at least good, and several of them are just awesome. It's a tough choice picking their best CD, but this one just barely beats out OK Computer. Both are pretty much flawless, but I prefer Kid A because it is more revolutionary. This is the album that no one expected Radiohead to make and that's part of its appeal. It is meant to be listened to in its entirety, much like Dark Side of the Moon, because this album as a whole is greater than just the sum of its parts. There's a strange energy and emotion that flows through all the blips and bleeps and even though this is the least human Radiohead CD it is still something beautiful, and I think that's the point. If you are looking for a hit single or traditional songs, skip this one. If you are willing to experience something truly unique and moving, give this one a spin. You won't regret it.
B000R8YC3G|5.0|I love this movie and recommend it to all my firends!!!!  I've turned at least 5 people onto this movie and I'll turn more it I can, ubt I don't have a HD player yet...... planning but not yet.... so if you can offer it in both formats I'll buy quick like I did with Hot Fuzz!!!  OH, MY GOD!!!!!  Soooooo funny!!!!!
B000RMQH30|5.0|This is a superb album. Everyone is our family loves it. The three first tracks alone are permanently moving.
B0000CNY27|5.0|Escape From NY is easily one of the best movies John Caprenter ever made, and a great movie in its own right.    I read some of the negative reviews on this movie out of curiosity, and learned that some people just do not understand what this movie is about, so I decided to write a some comments to deal with this.    Is this movie sci-fi?  Yes.  It is a gritty near future in relation to when it was released (1981).    Is it an action movie?  Yes, but don't expect silly wire-fu stunts.  This is a grittier flavor of violence and action, more on par with Blade Runner action (sans the gymnastics).    But most important, this is a movie about the main character, Snake Plissken, played briliantly by Kurt Russell, and his reaction or stance towards state authority.  Snake is not only an anti-hero, but he is the archetypal embodiment of anti-authority in general.  He's a bit of an anarchist, but he's principled.  He is a war hero turned criminal, but he's not a terrorist type of character, or a \\"double agent\\" who betrayes his country for money.  He is a person who has lost all sense of respect or trust in the governments of the world and rather than play them for money, wants only to dissappear from the world's affairs.  Unfortunately, he is caught while trying to escape from his robbery of a federal reserve, and sentenced to a super prison, the walled-in Manhattan Island.    Snake Plissken gets a chance to avoid his bleak sentence, though, by rescuing the president, whose plane went down over the island.    The prison of Manhattan Island is home to all sorts of prisoners who have built their own cultures, gangs, etc.  Through the madness of it all, Snake has to find and rescue the president, with a special tape recording the president made, in time for a global summit hearing, and also in time to save himself from the tiny capsule bombs implanted into his arteries in case Snake should try to escape without rescuing the president.  The end of this movie, which I will not spoil, is one of the great endings of all time, and perfectly defines Snake Plissken's view on things.    If you are expecting mindless action with people flying around on wires and engaging in impossible action stunts, then this movie is not for you.  But if you want an intelligent, entertaining, well written movie, filled with humor, gritty action, various character archetypes (many of them hilarious), and a main character who is not another cliched hero, then give this movie a try.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Theme: Protect what matters to you most by any means necessary.<br /><br />That means alot of blood and gore. enjoy!
B00005JP5P|4.0|This film was easily the best scored movie of 2007. The music not only fit the mood, it generated the mood. It also provided a backdrop to the emotive acting of Cillian Murphy and Michelle Yeoh. Most movies of this genre club you over the head with an attempt at explaning theoretical physics in 90 minutes - this movie, to its credit, does not. Sure, if you presented this film to a roomfull of astrophysicist, they would find flaw after flaw. But I'm not an astro-anything. I just love good movies and this definitely was one of few this year.
0743486285|5.0|This is by far one of the most interesting books I've ever read.  It is so unbelievable to me that someone could live the life that Nikki lived, and come out the other side the way he has!  The only caution I have is that its not reading for the faint of heart.  There is an abundance of foul language and graphic content.  However, its not unnecessary in this case.  Its part of the brutal honesty of this book, and his honesty in writing this astounds me.  Highly recommend!
B000P6XU56|2.0|Out of all the hd dvds I have purchased so far this one is by far the lowest resolution quality. Don't know why but its only a touch above a regular dvd in quality.So I'll probably send it on back for a refund or replacment from amazon. I've purchased only about 8 hddvd's so far and have had good luck with all of them, except this one.The quality of  the rest is awsome, unbeleavably good. So much detail to obsere for the first time, you find your self rewinding to watch seens over and over like when video first came out.  Very exciting indeed I just hope that more titles become available. I would buy lots of classic movies from the past but there severely lagging on getting out those titles. Come on don't they like making money? Isn't that what this is all about. Helloooooooooo hddvd companies get it together your loosing money.     other than that,(and the war of course) its all perfect.... peace
B00000DGUG|4.0|Morissette's follow up to her multi-platinum Jagged Little Pill is another fine album that I think is the better of the two.  The material on this disc was written following Morrissette's trip to India in 1997.  Many of the songs reflect a more inward looking approach as opposed to the jilted lover songs that predominated her previous effort.  This is overall a more mature album, and for the most part I think the disc is strong.  Some criticize Alanis for overwriting her lyrics and indeed she does get a bit wordy in spots, but I think most of the lyrics here are quite good.  This is not nearly as commercial an album as her last one was and it did not sell quite as well.  Thank U was the single and is a fairly good representation of the rest of the album.  Alanis voice is still in fine form, and the music, although nothing spectacular fits what she is trying to get across.  You can pick this up used from Amazon for one cent.  The album is well worth it for the price.
0767803434|4.0|Just as Dr. Strangelove bordered on the impossible (or did it?), this movie follows an implausible track and makes one feel more unsafe by the day. No Peter Sellers black comedy here. Remember also that this film was issued 4 years prior to 9/11. The true irony is that today in 2007, many people,I suspect, would feel safer with Harrison Ford in the Oval Office and having George Bush and Dick Cheney in a mid-air shootout with subversives over the European plain. In any kind of gunfight, take a Texan and a Wyoming man every time.
0307277887|5.0|I discovered \\"Dexter\\" through word of mouth about the Showtime series based on the title character.  I watched the whole first season (12 hours) in two days.  I ordered the book shortly thereafter.    \\"Darkly Dreaming Dexter\\" is fairly short and a fast read, but it is well written and an interesting glimpse into the soul of a psychopath.  A psychopath with a code, but a psychopath nonetheless.    Overall the TV show is better, in my opinion, due to the development of multiple story lines (the main plot diverges somewhat, as well) and periphery characters, but the book provides a far more detailed look at the inner workings of Dexter himself.  Thus, the show is made even better after reading the book.  Even if you don't watch the show, though, the book is a very worthwhile read.
0743486285|5.0|Wow, loved the band in the 80's and was a huge Nikki fan but after reading the book I have a whole new respect for him. If you loved the Crue this is a must read.
B000UJBYD8|4.0|This is a 2 CD set and while first CD is the same as the \\"Born into This\\" standard edition the second disc contains an extended version of the \\"Savages\\" song which is a great tune. Two demo versions of songs on the first disc which are interesting to listen to since they have a totally different sound. There are also two new songs not on the first disc. One of them being possibly the best song on the whole set (War Pony Destroyer).     I have noticed some people have panned this CD but I totally disagree. This is a very solid set of songs with high production standards but with a raw feel to them. It is very much a Cult CD with the Indian and mystical connotations, roaring guitars, and Ian Astbury's one-of-a-kind vocals. My faves on the set are the rockers: \\"Savages\\", \\"Sound of Destruction\\", \\"War Pony Destroyer\\", and \\"Dirty Little Rockstar\\". There is also a very good slow song \\"Holy Mountain\\" that really showcases Ian's vocals.
B000R7HY0K|2.0|Although Quentin Tarantino is without doubt a very talented writer and director, this film, it must be said, is a disappointment. It is clear from Kill Bill volumes 1 and 2 that Tarantino has a tendency to pander to his own whims in a way that is cinematically damaging. However in 'Death Proof' this pandering to whims turns into full blown self indulgence.    Most cinema goers have long been fans of the marvellous Tarantino dialogue that became the stuff of legends during the days of 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Reservoir Dogs'. However here that exact same dialogue is used as a crutch to drag audiences through a film that lacks anything more solid.    One thing that becomes patently obvious among this ubiquitous dialogue style is that Tarantino can only really write one type of female character. Although the icy-gazed, sass-mouthed, cold-hearted young woman character has served him well in many movies, it becomes somewhat tedious when multiplied by 7 in 'Death Proof'.    The central plotline would be a lot more compelling if it were not basically the same 45 minute plotline shown twice. It must also be said that there are too many frills and not enough body to it. To disappointed Tarantino fans I would say don't worry. One bad film does not mean he has lost his spark and I, for one, am sure that he will be back with something far more worthwhile.
B000B5XOYI|5.0|What a fabulous collection of Batman movies waiting for you! Micheal Keaton, Val Kilmer and George Clooney did a superb job as the Dark Knight fighting off the fabulous villains that we know and love (or hate)! I enjoyed watching these DVDs. They are exciting in every sense of the word! I know you will too!!
1401300529|5.0|My title is to indicate that it was never the author's intention to give the complete, blow-by-blow account of The Korean War story.  As he says in this book, another book has already been written on The Korean War that is comprehensive and excellent in his opinion.  I feel I must say this because  reviewers here have downgraded this well-researched book just because it doesn't tell \\"the whole story\\".  Halberstam wanted to tell the story with as much recollections from others who were there.  The human interest always fascinated Halberstam, along with the cold hard facts.  To tell the truth, I'm not sure I want to read all three years of this war.  There is only so much war one can take.  I loved this book for many reasons.  It was easy to read.  Not too much jargon (without explanation).    The interviews he conducted and previous books he read on the subject give this book a narrative flow, like an espionage novel, in parts, even though the information is non-fiction and well-documented, peppered with his trademark painstaking research and ear for dialogue.   As someone who is new to the history of The Korean War, it was especially  interesting to me how Halberstam brought in the back stories and \\"forward\\" stories if you will, including the fall of China, rise of Mao, paranoia in this country over Communism and its political implications, and especially how this war and the loss of China can be linked to the  Vietnam War.  All in all, this book is about a forgotten war, but it is also about a forgotten time in history, over 5o years ago, when many mistakes were made shaping more devastating quagmires in the distant and not so distant future.  A truly enlightening and entertaining book.
B000N6TX1I|4.0|It is England 2027 and for some unexplained reason, no children were born in 18 years in that country.  Women can no longer conceive and there are no more children playing around.  As world is getting older, it is not getting wiser.  There are terrorist groups, fractions fighing for immigrants rights to enter England, there are militant groups fighing for their political survival.  In a middle of all that misery and fright, Fuji woman is pregnant to everyone's bewilderment.  No one knows who the father is but that does not seem to matter as this young mother is determined to deliver her child and protect it.  There are groups that wish to profit from this event.  For them the birth of the child first time in 18 years is a political statement, particularly since mother is of non-British descent.  This is political, cultural and social revolution ignited by the new life of a baby girl.<br />I have never found more amuzing pothead as that portrayed by Michael Caine in this film.  Julianne Moore is a mother whose child is snatched from her by his untimely death.  In her grief she turns to political activism, terrorism and her own inevitable death ironically caused by her own peers.  Clive Owen is heartbroken father, husband of Moore's character, whose grief leads him to apathy towards life, alchoholism and determination to do whatever it takes in order to protect the innocent child.  He is surrogate father to a newborn girl whose mere existance is a miracle that stands on its own.<br />Powerful, touching and unapologetic.  Just what one would expect from talented director like Cuaron.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Quite Honestly I couldn't figure out Bruce's solo career.  He had a really good thing going with the E Street Band.  The music fit like a glove.  As  he progressed onto his solo career, Bruce kind of morphed into something I didn't recognize nor appealed to me anylonger.  He became a kind of former Rock turned acoustic - Bob Dylan thing.  Even his voice changed to become something un-recognizable to me.<br /><br />I think the E-Street Band gives Bruce a solid foundation to be a Front man yet share the stage with some equally great musicians.  I listened to the samples and I think this album of material is definitely worth listening to again.  And Bruce if you are listening, please, no more Bob Dylan and Pete Seeger stuff any longer.  It just doesn't cut it.

B00006GO9Q|5.0|Move over bop, here comes fusion. Cool, spiritual, funky, sophisticated, warm, slinky, mysterious, free. Finally, Miles' spirit broke loose from conventions of traditional jazz. You can feel it on preceding releases, something was trying to break out, a movement of the spirit, a restlessness, a need for new experiences in creativity. There was a feeling of incompleteness, of something missing. Well, Miles found it on this recording - a prototype fusion album, which opened the doors for later fusion developments. Somehow I feel that this is the best release of his fusion period, more focused, more relaxed, more spacial, more soul-searching. There is a sense of repose here, a satisfaction of having found. I feel this also every time I listen to this recording. It's soulful without being overtly funky, it's free without being atonal, it's electric without being loud, it's progressive without being experimental. A perfect balance. Needless to add, it features all of Miles' fusion disciples, (Zawinul, Corea, McLaughlin, Shorter, Williams, Holland) who learned key lessons here, and were getting ready to take  Miles' soul message into the world. A classic one of a kind album, and a must for any fan of fusion.
B000F3TBIO|5.0|This Cd seems to monopolize my Car stereo... the beats and music are top notch! Mike Patton just seems to work overtime... with all of his bands ex-Faith No more, Mr Bungle, Tomahawk.... etc etc.  This with out a doubt is one of his best works.  Very hypnotic and grooves throughout. It's like alternative rock mixed with dark hip hop.  Gotta hear it to know what I mean.  MOJO is definately one of my favs.  Check it out especially if you are a Mike Patton fan.
0743289684|4.0|I found that when I read this book, I kept on going back to the latest book by Christopher Hitchens _God is not Great_. I'm glad I read his book first, as Ali's book epitomizes what can be so wrong with religious fundamentalism that has gone astray or been misinterpreted.<br /><br />This book was fascinating from cover to cover. The author's voice was loud and her storytelling was vivid. Each of the sections shed light on different periods and aspects of her life. I was repeatedly struck with how she was able to overcome her circumstances and be so incredibly brave to start her life anew on the run from a mismatched arranged marriage.<br /><br />I also appreciated her social commentary about her life and the life around her that she witnessed. She wasn't judgemental in a negative or overbearing manner, but she did comment forcefully at times about what she didn't like or didn't fully understand.<br /><br />This book is worth reading and will help dispel cultural ignorance and eurocentricism. The audience for this is wide--lay audience and academic.
B0000042GM|5.0|A British musician once said to me \\"American musicians don't understand European music.\\" I was so stunned that I could only think to reply, \\"But what about Murray Perahia?\\"  To which she responded, \\"Murray Perahia? He's British.\\" I then explained that while Perahia may live in London, he was raised in New York City, where he attended the Mannes School of Music. She seemed sceptical. Of course, after we parted I subsequently thought of scores of American musicians who have performed \\"European\\" music with great understanding, but unfortunately, I never saw her again.    All this to say that I wish I had mentioned Julius Katchen that day.  Although I don't suppose she would have known about the remarkable recordings that Katchen made with the great Czech violinist, Josef Suk, of the Brahms Violin Sonatas, or the equally fine recordings that he made of the Brahms Piano Trios, with Suk and cellist Janos Starker. Nor would she likely have known about this set of the Complete Brahms Solo Piano Music, which is overall the best set that I have ever heard.  Listening again to Katchen's utterly beautiful playing of the late Brahms Intermezzi Op.117, I am reminded of just how outrageous her comment really was. Katchen was a pianist of real intellect, who possessed a deep emotional understanding of this very \\"European\\" music, and he was from Long Branch, New Jersey. In fact, I can think of only a handful of pianists that I would put in his same class for the playing of Brahm's solo piano music: they would include Radu Lupu, Dmitri Bashkirov, Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli--whose \\"Four Ballades\\" surpass everyone, even Gilels--and historically speaking, Walter Gieseking and Wilhelm Backhaus. (Emil Gilels, Sviatoslav Richter, and Annie Fischer were all exceptional in Brahms solo piano works, but they didn't record much of it.)  I also have a very special fondness for a double CD set of late Brahms piano music played by the Russian pianist Dmitri Aleexev on the EMI label.  (Of the more recent crop of pianists, I have enjoyed Nicholas Angelich's recordings on the Virgin label, Ivo Janssen, Helene Grimaud, and I am very much hoping that Nelson Freire will get around to recording some of the solo works, after his brilliant recent recording of the piano concertos.)  But as complete sets go, this Katchen set is definitely the one to get, and is essential for any lover of the music of Brahms.    The sound is mostly analoque, and is generally very good. My only complaint is that it is a little recessed--although be warned that I have an earlier Decca Ovation release, and not this later release--so, mine may be a little different. There were times when I felt forced to turn the volume up in an effort to hear the quieter, more ruminative passages, which Katchen plays so tenderly--then, when he launched into the more thunderous passages it was a little jarring, and I had to jump up to turn the volume back down. Part of this is simply due to the wide range of emotions inherent in these compositions, and will be a problem no matter which recording one is listening to. But it is also partly due to the difficulty of transfering a very decent analogue piano recording from the LP days into a digital CD format. I am fortunate enough to have a Decca LP boxed set of these recordings from the early 1980s, and I don't remember ever having this sound problem. That set also included the Violin Sonatas with Suk, which likewise sounded more natural and life-like than on the various CD incarnations that I have purchased over the years.
B000002VSN|3.0|The most substantial part of 1996 soundtrack to the \\"Preacher's Wife\\" movie is rooted firmly in gospel and these songs are undisputably the highlights of this rather underrated affair (no wonder, really, since the film is a dud even for the holiday standards and never quite gets going despite starring Denzel Washington and Whitney). The situation is similar to the 1995 coupling of \\"Waiting to Exhale\\" movie and its soundtrack, which certainly was better than the movie itself (even though \\"Exhale\\" is still a better movie than \\"Preacher's Wife\\"). HOWEVER, this is the album to get if you want to hear Whitney Houston singing powerful gospel anthems -- especially \\"I Go To the Rock\\" and Kirk Franklin's \\"Joy\\" are really delightful, even uplifting. The album also offers two versions of its main singles -- \\"I Believe in You and Me\\" and Annie Lennox-penned \\"Step By Step\\". However, it is also a testimony that the Babyface writing-producing star (so invincible between 1992 and 1995) was already waning -- only a year after Whitney called him \\"mine\\" in the liner notes to \\"Waiting to Exhale\\". This album is already a kind of rarity now, but for TRUE fans of the singer it should be a must.
0743486285|2.0|I thought the book was boring. Perhaps a good scare tactic for those who have never experienced some form of narcotic addiction and is considering the rock star life style. I was hoping this book would shed some light on how to recover from an addiction of his kind. It simply a self-loathing pity party. And in the sick twisted mind of a future addict a how to manual. I was hoping the diary entries would be followed by recovery and coping but I felt he was almost gloating about how messed up his life was. Like it's something to be admired, cuz he was such a bada**. I felt no humility is this book. It was quoted some where by Nikki that this was to hopefully prevent others from taking his path. Perhaps he should've expressed other ways to deal with issues. I don't need to know how to party, I know that, and I'm good at it. What I was hoping for was another perspective on how to stay sober.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|Perhaps no film I've ever seen has so well captured the essence of the Roman Catholic Church before Vatican II. This is a simple and perfectly sustained work of art about the spiritual struggle of one soul who seeks to be a nun and a nurse in a semi-cloistered convent before and during World War II.  It is a lense through which one can see tne entire religion and its deepest values: complete dedication to Our Lord Jesus Christ, complete love of neighbor and of enemy, complete abandon to the will and the way of Christ.  Watching the film tonight, I can hardly believe that it was made in 1959, even though I've watched it many times over the years.  It is timeless in its power.  For Catholic and non-Catholic, it provides profound religious truths.  It transcends its subject matter and asks of the viewer: if you believe in Him, what are you doing for Him? The film speaks to the human in each of us, to the broken one in each of us, and reminds us of the absolute to which a person can give his or her life.
B000V8I2QU|3.0|This has some good stuff on it, Radio Nowhere, Living in the Future, Long Walk Home, Girls in their Summer Clothes, but a lot of just OK songs.  It does not have a bad song on it, but not a true classic song either. The bonus track,  Terry's song is good and different.  Compared to Live in Dublin though, this one does not stack up.  THAT is a MASTERPIECE.
0743424425|5.0|I first read this book two decades ago.  In the intervening years, I spent most of my time reading reading wonderful fiction and non-fiction, and most ofte the \\"classics\\" which, as an adult, I felt I couldn't live without.    Still, through all the years, Stephen King's thrilling masterpiece, evoked with language so pristine and evocative, is absolutely brilliant. There is a point beyond which you cannot stop reading (roughly midway) and a plethora of subplots and cinematic descriptions that far excel the Stabley Kubrick film of the same name.    As one who has taught and represented writing for many years, I would even recommend this to teenagers who are reluctant to read -- because it is so magnetic and irresisitable. True, there is a bit of raw language and imagery, but we live in an era in which life is far more raw and threatening.    This IS King's masterpiece. He took the mantle from Poe and created from it a modern genre.  Whatever your reading preferences, you won't be disappointed. This is one rollercoaster of novel with imagery and characters that will remain with you long after you close the book.
B000TGCR38|4.0|This was quite an interesting and suspenseful WW2 drama. Set in Nazi-occupied Holland, the film follows Rachel Stein (Carice van Houten), a Dutch Jew in hiding, as she becomes involved in the Dutch resistance, eventually infiltrating the local Gestapo headquarters by seducing it's Captain, Ludwig Muntze (Sebastian Koch). What follows is a tumultuous odyssey with lots of betrayal, sex, violence, despair, humor, and even love where you would least expect it. Good guys turn into bad guys and vice versa.<br /><br />Personally, I'm all about graphic (female) nudity so that didn't bother me in the least, although I didn't need to see that much of Franken! Overall, I thought the film was very good although it seemed a bit scattered, and there were a few aspects that seemed a bit stereotypical and/or implausible. These are just minor criticisms though, in an otherwise enjoyable and compelling film. Four stars.<br /><br />Oh and I almost forgot, Carice van Houten....Yikes! If only I wasn't married my love.
B000OYC3J8|4.0|It's been a while since we've had a White Stripes album and this was definately worth the wait.  It's Jack and Meg again.  Jack's guitar is tearing it up.  Meg's actually gotten a little better too.  She's not a great drummer but her subtle style let's Jack's playing shine.  You can really feel and hear the variety of Jack White's influences and the breadth of his style.  He may be the preeminent guitarist of the new millinium.  You've got everything from slow blues to tear the walls down rock and it's all good baby.  This is a solid album.    Here's the track by track breakdown:     1. Icky Thump:  BEST GUITAR RIFF OF 2007!!!  2. You Don't Know What Love Is:  You can feel the Memphis and Nashville influences on this great track.  Good and easy listening.  3. 300 MPH Torrential Outpour Blues:  Slow start leading you on through the song.  It's like a slow goodbye kiss from a new-ex-girlfriend.  4. Conquest:  Cheeky.  I don't know why but this just sounds like it should be on the soundtrack of a Tarantino film.    5. Bone Broke:  Solid rock and roll.  This is the White Stripes from 2000.  6. Prickly Thorn, But Sweetly Worn:  The bagpipes are not what you'd expect.  Jack White's try at a Irish drinking song?  I'll drink to that.  7. St. Andrew:  I'm not sure what this is other than a reason to get Meg's vocals on the album.  Skip it.  8. Little Cream Soda:  Just a great Jack White tune.  9. Rag and Bone:  Great blues riffs but the vocals are a little off.  I'd love to see Jack guitar on this rework in with new lyrics.  10. I'm Slowly Turning Into You:  This is going to sound weird but it's like Eddie and the Cruisers mixed with the White Stripes, but it works!  11. A Martyr For My Love For You:  We all know this one, it's that woman you should walk away from but just can't.  12. Catch Hell Blues:  There are almost no lyrics and you don't need it.  This is a great instrumental blues jam.  13. Effect and Cause:  It almost has a seventies Rod Stewart flavor layed over Janice Joplin.  I love it!    Recommendation: Everyone should buy it.

630587493X|1.0|In my humble opinion, this movie was way too simplistic, sometimes even silly. I couldn't even finish it. I feel really sorry for Williams, one of my favorite actors, whose career has to carry the stigma of this movie. Believe me, this is not a sci-fi flick; it's a soap opera.<br /><br />However, I have to admit that a lot of people like this movie. The same people who like soap operas, reality shows, talk shows and who enjoyed \\"Evan Almighty\\". This includes most of my family. You might like it, too. Not everybody is a critic.<br /><br />For the more critic among you, Spielberg's \\"Artificial Intelligence\\", \\"I robot\\" and even \\"The Animatrix\\" are better treatments of the same subject.
B00003CWTI|4.0|Magnolia is like a modern opera it's a long and drawn out affair where everyone is tied together by some string of fate. I did happen to like certain aspects of it and liked certain characters more than others. I could have done without a 10 year old rapper kid jibber-jabbering about being a prophet.        This movie really reminded me a lot of Crash, or maybe because Magnolia actually came first Crash really reminded me of it. The movie seems to be a primer in the chaos theory. The famous example of chaos theory being if a butterfly flaps its wings on one side of the world it causes typhoons on the other side of the world, or maybe big fat bullfrogs raining from the sky. A lot of movies seem to want explore this degree of separation theory. I am getting a bit over it as they say.       Everyone except Mark Wahlberg and Burt Reynolds was in Magnolia from Boogie Nights, I began to wonder if the just didn't have the script reading on the same day.        Overall I think this movie was well thought out, but a bit too convoluted and maybe just too many characters with too many sub-plots.  I gave it 3 and half stars.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|All you have to do is listen to the words!!!!  That says it all!!!!!  We just went to their concert in Cleveland.  Not one bit of profanity out of their mouths!!!!  The performance was riveting!  Can't wait to see them again.  The encore performance was Rise Today, and WOW!!!!!!
0784011710|5.0|Sophie's Choice is the first Meryl Streep movie that I saw and this film lead me into her many other films. Her portrayl of a polish immigrant was done so well it was hard for me to believe that is was Meryl Streep. Streep has a way of convincing people when she acts. I really felt as if I was watching the real account of a polish woman that had been in a concentration camp during World War II. This movie is moving and very sad because of what Sophie went through and the choices that she had to make just so that she could live. Streep is an excellent actress and I would watch this film again. I give this film 5 stars because of the directing and the acting from the actors in this film.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|When I first saw this movie, it couldn't help comparing it to the Gene Wilder movie, so I was disappointed through most of the movie. That was until I saw the ending.<br /><br />The ending on the Gene Wilder movie was unsatisfying, to say the least. It really left you with a bad taste in the mouth, it was... really frustratingly ambiguous and vague for me as a kid. Must be one of the worst movie endings of all time. I loved the oompa-loompa songs in the old movie, but as a whole it wasn't very re-watchable, and thus I didn't buy the video.<br /><br />This one was different: The oompa-loompa songs are kinda... way too pop for my taste (the originals were more whimsical), but as a whole the movie is much more worth owning in DVD, and the reason for that is the sub-plot that finally develops in the ending, which is conclusive and not ambiguous at all. And the dark imagery, of course, makes it appealing to Tim Burton fans such as myself.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Last year the cable station Showtime, which in my opinion is now rivaling if not surpassing HBO in original programming gave us Dexter.      On cable you have all these C.S.I type shows leading the ratings so what if someone made a show about a crime scene investigator who specializes in blood splatter and in his free time is a serial killer of bad people.  What a great concept, but would the show live up to the idea?  The answer is, hands down, yes.      Dexter has a 5 star rating with 105 Amazon reviews as I write this, made American Film Institutes top 10 shows in 2006, and the lead actor who plays Dexter Michael C. Hall (Six Feet Under) got nominated for a golden globe.    The show goes much deeper into Dexter's life than mentioned above.  A tragic and horrific incident happened in Dexter's childhood.  That is when he met his adopted father and mentor Harry and became part of his family along with a sister.  This tragic event changed Dexter and left him with an appetite for killing.  Harry noticed this and gives Dexter a code, a set of principles to live by so he's able to fit in and function in society.  Teaching him to harness that evil and channel it for good.  Dexter has blocked out the memories of the past that have made him what he is but as each episode has us eagerly waiting next week Dexter starts to remember his past little by little with a little help from a \\"cold\\" hearted friend.    To go more into the plot is to ruin the experience of watching this great and original show.    When Season 1 wrapped I remember thinking that this is perfect and they shouldn't do another season.  It gave us closure wrapped up with a little bow and I didn't think it could get any better.  However 3 episodes into season 2 it once again has surprised me and exceeded my expectation.      What better time then October in between watching horror films than to sit down and watch a witty charismatic serial killer that would have impressed Hannibal Lecter while being more efficient than him.      Dexter will have you on the edge of your seat, questioning the criminal justice system, analyzing your own morals, and all the while making you laugh.    Dexter plays Sundays at 9pm on Showtime with an encore at 11pm after the premier of Brotherhood.
B000SSGUEO|5.0|This show was re-released a few years back, with the missing \\"Space Truckin'\\" finally added. Now it's been re-released AGAIN, \\"Space Truckin'\\" still included. Re-release, re-release, re-release. Oh if only there were 16 releases of everything else. Yes, the music is great. This is probably the single hottest performance for sale, featuring the Mark III line-up. But how often must the same stuff be released? What, am I gonna buy it because there is a new cover for it?
0800141660|5.0|There's not much to say about this movie that hasn't already been said over and over in these reviews. I'd like to add that I think Jane Austen would have approved of the little bits and pieces that Emma Thompson added to the original story in writing the screenplay. She seems to have captured the essence of Austen's wry sense of humor. Be sure to to watch Emma Thompson's Golden Globe acceptance speech which is one of the extras on this DVD. It's written as if Jane herself were observing the evening's events and it's incredibly clever.
6305358567|3.0|There seems to be an ever-going fascination with good queen Bess these days.  To me the deffinitive portraits on video were done with Glenda Jackson back in the early 1970s on BBC.  The acting and attention to detail were supurb.  Compared to that a movie like this comes off second or third place.<br /><br />This film suffers from being over done.  While Cate Blanchatte is fetching, she alone is not enough to carry a very heavy-handed production.  Because of the number of events that are being condensed into a two hour production the end result is the usual montage of MTV like images that flash onto the screen.  This seems to be a popular filming techneque now.  Flood the viewer with a collage of images all at once so they can't think about the actual content of the film.  Add to that over-powering music, much of not period I might add, and you complete the current package for today.  A confused mess!  Add to this that many if the actors look and act too comtemporary.  We have not even gott'en into the historical inaccuracies yet!  They are many and have been covered by other reviewers.  I would also say that the murder of Mary of Guise is wrong, and the use of Norfolk to represent all the evil Catholics in England at the time is over-simplification. The actor who plays him is terrible.  He is like some punk rocker stuffed into tights!<br /><br />The film has many other problems but I shall not list them.  I think the problem lies with the East Indian producer/director who does not know how to handle English history.<br /><br />The recent addition Elizabeth, The Golden Age that just came out suffers from many of the same issues above, but the storyline and events are presented in somewhat clearer fashion.  It would be nice if historical epics today tried to focus more on the actual events they are portraying rather than on special effects and over the top screen writing.
0553805460|3.0|I bought this book thinking I was getting a Wall Street memoir filled with insights into one of the more infamous forms of the last decade (Stratton Oakmont).  In reality only about a 1/3 of the book even touches upon what happened at this legendary firm.  The author's position in the firm could have really been insightful.  On this front I was disappointed.<br />  However I still give the book review 3 stars for its tale of a man who was truly out of control.  This is really more a story centered around Belfort's wild life, spending habits and sexual mores.<br />  If you want a Wall Street memoir.  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK

B000WC39ZY|5.0|In Martin Scorsese's much-maligned NEW YORK, NEW YORK, the hollow artifice of the 1940s Technicolor musical clashes with the brutal honesty of human emotion, in a story about a doomed relationship between two individuals whose mutual love for music draws them together and pulls them apart.<br /><br />In post-war New York, brash saxophonist Jimmy Doyle (Robert De Niro) meets young singer Francine Evans (Liza Minnelli), and together they join forces to create a new jazz and big-band sound. In typical \\"Star is Born\\" fashion, Francine is signed to a major record label and later becomes a Hollywood movie star; Jimmy's callous attitude to her wanting to start a family becomes the key for their break-up. The tempestuous love affair of Francine and Jimmy is the backbone of NEW YORK, NEW YORK, almost two different movies rolled into one: affectionate tribute to the classic Hollywood musical, and dramatic backstage romance. That duality is the reason why NEW YORK, NEW YORK stands up well to repeat screenings; Scorsese's masterful touch is all over this masterpiece, which is only now beginning to be recognized as a classic of it's time.<br /><br />While the story may seem to be channeling \\"A Star is Born\\" (which starrred Minnelli's mother Judy Garland as an unknown who outgrows her husband's moviestar success); the characters of Francine and Jimmy, and their violent relationship, share a closer kinship to the Doris Day/James Cagney musical drama \\"Love Me or Leave Me\\"; where Day's abusive real-life 1941 marriage to jazz musician Al Jordan was also paralleled.<br /><br />Visually, the movie is a rare treat; Laszlo Kovacs' cinematography and the art direction of Boris Leven is flawless. In one memorable scene, Jimmy and Francine wander into a yellowed barren wood that looks like something from the opening titles of \\"Doctor Zhivago\\". Veteran M-G-M hair stylist Sydney Guilaroff took care of Ms Minnelli's many elaborate, period-perfect hair creations (and in another lovely twist, Minnelli got to use her mother Judy Garland's original M-G-M dressing room while making this movie).<br /><br />NEW YORK, NEW YORK used many original songs of the period for it's soundtrack (\\"You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me\\", \\"You Are My Lucky Star\\", \\"The Man I Love\\", \\"Just You, Just Me\\"). Especially-written for the movie by her longtime collaborators John Kander and Freb Ebb were several new songs which became staples of Liza Minnelli's repertoire (\\"But the World Goes 'Round\\", \\"Happy Endings\\", and \\"New York, New York\\"). The extensive production number for \\"Happy Endings\\" was modeled after the \\"Born in a Trunk\\" sequence from Judy Garland's \\"A Star is Born\\".<br /><br />Robert De Niro's saxophone solos were dubbed by Georgie Auld (De Niro does a very convincing job of handling the instrument). The supporting cast includes Mary Kay Place, Larry Kert, Lionel Stander and Barry Primus.<br /><br />I can't recommend this movie highly enough. NEW YORK, NEW YORK, initially dismissed by audiences and critics upon it's release in 1977, is now slowly being discovered as a masterpiece for the ages, and I for one am thrilled.mother Judy Garland's original M-G-M dressing room while making this movie).

B000006NUW|5.0|This set was PURPOSELY mastered in all mono, for the uninformed complainers among you!  These are the tracks THE WAY THEY WERE ORIGINALLY RELEASED AND THE WAY YOU STILL HEAR THEM ON THE RADIO TODAY!    Motown had been releasing stereo versions of these songs on CD for YEARS starting in about 1985-86.  Many customers complained that those were NOT the versions they had remembered hearing, in the 1960s OR the 1980s (on oldies radio).  The artists' voices sounded wrong, for one thing.  That's because the stereo versions were usually NEW recordings made with the artist RE-SINGING the song--and they sounded different--not the way we remembered.  So, Motown in 1992 brought in top remastering engineers to go through the original tapes and re-master the original hits, the way they were originally cut, as SUNG originally.    This set represents the fruit of those efforts, and it is SUPERB.  The mono recordings at all times have more punch than the stereo verions, since the stereo cuts were made for albums compiled LATER.  The stereo effect itself was often a phony \\"stereo-like\\" dilution only, not true stereo. The true hit versions are what you hear on this unrivaled set.    The complaining reviewers here simply have no idea about the history of this set, which was a MAJOR project undertaken to bring back the best and ACTUAL sound, period.      My only concern . . . \\"What's Going On\\" by Marvin Gaye was, as I recall, the name of a song and its album.  It was released on the album first, hence the mono version on this boxed set (which isn't as smooth and is more \\"funky\\" to me), was the afterthought version.  While mono, it's NOT the original, so I don't see why it's here.    Otherwise, the only omission of real substance on this set appears to be some of the early Supremes hits . . . though, to me, if anything has been overplayed for years, those were the songs, and hence were the best choice to be omitted.    This set is the definitive Motown box set, ESPECIALLY CONCERNING AUDIO QUALITY.  Those who desire stereo are just asking for the inferior versions.  And those versions were available for years, because the Motown executives interviewed in the early 1990s indicated that they thought (wrongly) that stereo would be preferred on CD, even at the expense of having the true hit versions.  They admitted their error, sought to correct it, and this project is the end result.
B000V1Z8KK|5.0|My hubby and I just love this movie we have watch it 3 times and at 99 cents why not
B000H0MKOC|5.0|The story itself is interesting. It is a satirical look at political activism and advertising today which it calls spin. The hero is a spokesman for Big Tobacco, who tries to push cigarettes by claiming that it is the rights of smokers.     I also found the different characters interesting. Overall they came together well. Much of the acting was good. Not surprising as some were very good. In particular I did like Aaron E. Eckhart performance!    Some of the stuff was a bit over the top but it is a movie.    I also liked some of the logic, examples and methods of argument used.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|Torchwood is the most-times dark, sometimes gory, adult tie-in to the new Doctor Who series, but that hardly matters as it is the most unique TV you'll ever see. ..Dr. Who producer & two-time Hugo-nominated writer Russell T. Davies created the series as an opportunity to do more than just family fare, part CSI, part X-files and the remaining part is out there on its own.  In Dr. Who there have been hidden references to the \\"secret\\" organization TORCHWOOD (the name which is an anagram of DOCTOR WHO) since season one (an answer given by the ANNE DROID in BAD WOLF episode 12 ), then appearing more physically throughout season two, even featuring the origin of the organization created by  Queen Victorian herself to defend the Earth from alien threats, including The Doctor.  The series takes place over a hundred years later as Jack says on the promos, \\"In the 21st century, everything changes.\\" Captain Jack Harkness (played BRILLIANTLY by the dashing John Barrowman, best known to Americans as the singing Nazi lead in the \\"Springtime for Hitler\\" number in the Producers musical) is a character introduced during season one of Dr. Who, an ex-time agent, con-man, the Doctor & Rose meet in the 1940's and turn towards the path of good and righteousness, well almost.<br /><br />Jack is originally from the 51st century, which is intended to explain his oversexed ways (i.e. he is very liberal in who he \\"SNOGS\\"& \\"SHAGS\\" ) His background is really complex, even before he meets the Doctor, but he is missing some of his memories from his time as a time-agent, during the \\"Parting of the Ways\\" the first season finale of Dr. Who his character becomes even more interesting, but I won't say more without spoiler warnings.<br /><br />I know I've referenced Dr. Who, a lot, but WATCHING DR. WHO IS NOT A PREREQUISITE FOR ENJOYING TORCHWOOD, MERELY A BONUS. There is a level to Torchwood that is directed at DW fans, but it isn't obtrusive.  The initial season of Torchwood begins introducing the viewer to its world through the eyes of Gwen, a low-rung Cardiff lady cop, eventually becomes part of a jaded almost amoral group that uses scavenged alien-tech to protect the world from future threats. The neophyte member eventually serves as catalysis to re-humanize the team. But the dynamic of the characters is one of abrasiveness, deceit, love and lust. The major players are far from perfect, by the end of the season, most of the team have done things both unexpected and at times alarming.<br />Most of the performances are great to watch, much Americanized, gritty acting. Gwen, played by Eve Myles, who oddly enough played a Victorian servant girl named Gwyneth who opens the closes the very rift Torchwood is build on in Dr. Who season 1. Gwen is an earthy attractive but not unrealistically so, as are most of the players, except Jack, of course, who is over-the-top silver-screen good looking, which is perfect for his over-the-top fearless-leader-with-a-mysterious-past archetype.<br /><br />Torchwood is very stylish, lots of aerial shots of building in Cardiff, the Welsh city where the series is filmed and most of the action takes place.  Its waterside features remind me of New Orleans.  Another anchor location of the show in Cardiff is soooo appropriately the Roald Dahl Plaza (Carciff-born creator of Willy Wonka) it would naturally hold a time-space rift and the headquarters of a secret organization under the fountain where it can monitor extra-terrestrial traffic through the rift. Kind of a sexed up Men in Black, except no one wears black,  well ok Iantos does, but he's more of a case manager type. The series music co-composed by Dr. Who's Murray Gold is both edgy and original. As is the special effects and make-up. In the pilot episode, the make-up on the Weevil, a reoccurring species, is so good that a long scene is shot in full-light with Gwen and another character studying the creature. That is how confident and bold the makers of Torchwood are! The series wona BEST DRAMA SERIES BAFTA (the British Academy of Film and Television Arts), besting Doctor Who season 2 in the category and  first episodes gave BBC 3 its highest ratings ever.  One series flaw is that Torchwood is meant to be very covert, but they also seem to be high profile \\"special ops,\\" other than that amusing conflict, I love the series and think that many Americans who may have never watched any British TV before, will be hooked!<br /><br />The episode guide that follows may have some MINOR SPOILERS, okay?<br /><br />#1 \\"Everything Changes\\"<br /><br /> This is a good one, I give it 9 out of 10,  it is one of the best series pilots I've seen. Unlike some series openers, it seems familiar with characters and where they are going, there's no early season one awkwardness here,  INFACT, Eve Myles WON a \\"BEST-ACTRESS\\" BAFTA (Wales) for this one, John Barrowman got a nom...<br /><br />Episode Synopsis:<br /><br />South Wales coffee makin' cop Gwen Cooper is at the scene of a murder when Torchwood shows,  Gwen snoops on the group and sees in a disturbing scene in which the victim is temporally resurrected, then  questioned. She starts her own investigation to learn more, and ends up meeting an alien and literally going underground unsuccessfully disguised as a pizza-girl, joins up and then things get weird....<br /><br />#2 Day One<br /><br />This one is less good, but is all about the fact that Torchwood is an adult series and begins to set some boundaries. Even so, this one has a great pre-titles scene with Gwen & her boyfriend, and a great opening line...7 out of 10 for this one...<br /><br />Episode Synopsis:<br /><br />The title says it all...it is Gwen's first day on the job, and because of her obligatory noob screw up she unwittingly unleashes a hot-sex-addicted-alien....no REALLY...this  one is about AN ALIEN WHO SHAGS HER WAY THROUGH THE EPISODE...it seems like a Captain Jack natural. There are some great moments and some great lude dialogue, like following the discovery of the alien's nature and the disintegrated remains of its first partner, Harkness remarks that the guy \\"came and went, at the same time.\\" More lines like that and hot-girl-on-alien action...<br /><br />#3 Ghost Machine<br /><br />This one is spooky and provides some insights into the gruff team member Owen's character.  Usually, so far, Owen, played by Burn Gorman, isn't the sort to get involved or outwardly show his real feelings, in the series thus far, he has deflected them and given Gwen and the others attitude to cover.  This time, due to his unique interaction with the machine, he is very open and driven.... 8 out of 10 for this one...<br /><br />Episode Synopsis:<br /><br />The team retrieve an alien artifact that shows ghost images of the past, thus allowing Owen to witnesses a girl's murder some forty years before. He becomes obsessed with bring the murderer to justice, while Gwen tries to stop future projections from occurring as well.<br /><br />#4 Cyberwoman<br /><br />This one may be too much for the Dr. Who fans, but you need not know the back-story to appreciate the story, but it helps to forgive the nature of the story that seems awkward when compared to the rest of the season. The Cybermen, humans converted from a parallel Earth, were all meant to be destroyed at another Torchwood base on this Earth, this is the exception. This time a half converted erotic-cyborg with more gruesome conversion effects and other creepiness, oh and Cyberwoman vs. the pterodactyl...did I mention they have a pterodactyl in the Torchwood HQ...7.5 out of 10 for this one...<br /><br />Episode Synopsis:<br /><br />Ianto, played by Gareth David-Lloyd who is sort of the teams Alfred the Butler, managing the Batcave,  has hidden what's left of his girlfriend  at Torchwood. His plans to get outside help end with the entire team at risk of finding themselves converted or worse!<br /><br />#5 Small Worlds<br /><br />This one is creepy, if a little predictable, takesomething inherently cute and friendly, like say fairies, and make them dangerous, powerful and a little homicidal, throw in a spooky little girl, an old girl friend of Jack's er... Dad...and you have a winning mix,  8.5 out of 10 for this one....<br /><br />Episode Synopsis:<br /><br />Jack's senior friend has discovered fairies in a nearby wood, while Torchwood uncovers a mysterious jail death and weird weather bursts. Jack sees a pattern connected to his mysterious past....<br />#6 Countrycide<br />This one is grisly, edgy and very frightening, playing-out like a mainstream horror movie, a good one!  This one isn't for the squeamish.  ...9 out of 10 for Countrycide...<br /><br />Episode Synopsis:<br /><br />Deaths in the middle of nowhere split up the team, Gwen and Owen find themselves in another tight situation, a survivor hides from the killer, Tech-chick Tosh and Ianto race against the clock, and the team fight to stay off the menu.<br /><br />#7 Greeks Bearing Gifts<br /><br />This one isn't the best of the season, but it does give more development to Tosh's character...6.5 out of 10...<br /><br />Episode Synopsis:<br /><br />Tosh gets a strange pendant from a strange woman and she gains the strange ability to read  minds. In the process learning way more than just casual thoughts, in order to make things right Tosh must get this woman into Torchwood H.Q.<br /><br />#8 They keep killing Suzie<br /><br />This is a great one...disturbing and well written, a fallen Torchwood member returns providing a unique opportunity to deal with the consequences of events in the pilot episode. A great exploration of Gwen and her place in Torchwood...

B000VKJ6VS|5.0|I named my cat Monti after Mark Tremonti so you might think that my opinion of their music would already be of the positive but when I first heard the single Rise Today I got scared...scared that I was feeling disappointed in it and not liking it.  BUT then I bought the CD and I was completely blown away with how amazingly diverse each song is.  Now I'm ashamed that I even doubted for one second that anything Alter Bridge made could be bad.  Mark's guitar solos and Myles voice are absolutely incredible!<br /><br />You can tell these guys poured themselves completely into this CD.  They always have given it their all...I've seen it many times front row at their shows.  They love making music and rocking out in front of a crowd and I really hope that this CD gets the recognition it deserves...unlike their debut CD that didn't have the proper advertising to back it.  I plan on buying this CD for all my friends as early xmas presents.
032147404X|5.0|I found this book to be very useful and worth every penny.  However, the lower corner of the book cover says it's good for you even if you have a point-and-shoot camera and I don't believe that to be true.  You really need to have an SLR camera in order to get value from this book.  I have one and I learned a lot about how to use it better as a result of this purchase.  I would recommend this to anyone who would like to know how to take professional looking pictures without all the mumbo-jumbo lingo that some books offer.  I think it's so good that even if I'd checked it out at my library, I'd still go purchase it just to have a copy in my camera bag.
0743486285|5.0|I have been a Crue fan since Too Fast For Love.  At the time, I was a very naive teen and as I've seen after reading this book, very sheltered as well.  This has been one of the most intense and gripping books I've read in years.  The realism is so descriptive, it's almost surreal.  To think that anyone could live through such torment and Hell is quite remarkable - but to come out on top as Nikki did is truly amazing!    I read at night before bed and I woke up with a disturbing sense about me several times...while I don't remember my dreams exactly, it was clearly left over sentiment from that evening's diary entries.  The only downside was that it was just a year in the life - I could have read on and on...  I highly recommend this book to anyone!
B000TUXL2A|5.0|4 weeks after release I decided to view how others regard this CD. I am pleased that most get it. As others have stressed one must listen several times to grasp its value. The songs are finely written, the instrumentation immaculate. Knopfler takes us through a panorama of moods & emotions. I too miss the gut-wrenching guitar solos. I sense the appropriate places they should have been. I anticipate them, when they don't occur I smile & continue to listen. I agree with others that Dire Straits fans still hanging in will likely drop out. Perhaps this was Knopfler's intent. But those of us who appreciate the diverseness of his solo work & soundtracks will eagerly await his next piece of work.
0380713802|4.0|This is my third Bryson book, and so far so good. The AT book was a bit better, and the Short History was a bit broader, but so far they all follow a simple but successful format. Bryson goes somewhere, observes and then writes about it. The writing is not usually laugh out loud funny, but it has enough funny moments and humorous observations that when these are combined with the interesting facts tossed out by Bryson that you end up feeling that you got your money's worth.<br /><br />Neither Here nor There starts with his second (major) trip to mainland Europe (he lived in semi-Europe, that is, England, for seventeen years) and he starts with an epic bus trip to view the northern lights in the Nome of Norway. At least I think it was Norway, it was some non-descript Scandinavian country. In any case he captures well the feeling of being on the edge of nowhere in a community so bland it makes your last Young Republican rally seem like the Watts riots. He alternates between being wryly bemused and clinically depressed, but weaves it all together when he finally does get to see the lights, in all their glory.<br /><br />The wry bemusement versus clinical depression seems to be a common theme of the book, if not his life, and it helps you kind of root for him as he goes gallivanting like a trust fund baby through all of Europe. Italy, Germany, Yugoslavia, Belgium, even Liechtenstein- he doesn't miss much. I think Spain and Greece got bypassed somehow, but pretty much everywhere else he hit. Even a brief hangout time at pre-war Bosnia, a bit surreal.<br /><br />I really don't find any great weakness in the book, other than there is no traveling partner of any kind to give dimension. Some of the better bits are his reminisces, if they can be called that, of his earlier trip with his friend Katz. Katz is a character, to say the least, with all the in-your-face-humanity of a Homer Simpson without the FCC to keep him in check. He should've tried to get old Katz out of by-gosh Iowa for one more trek of the Old Country. We do get to run into him again in the Appalachians in another Bryson book, but Europe would've benefited by him, too, in my opinion.<br /><br />I've only ever been to Austria (which he slams a bit) and Switzerland which he also slams a bit, but from my limited experience his observations seemed to be at least in the ballpark. Switzerland is very expensive (sehr teuer) and Austria is full of Austrians and both are full of beautiful mountains. And if you don't like German it doesn't matter- everybody speaks English, most likely as well as you do.of the Old Country.

B000PFU7OO|5.0|I saw the movie and went immediately to the record store to buy the CD because I couldn't tolerate hearing anything other than those two voices again.  After going to three stores (all were sold out!) I put the disc into the player and four months later this CD is still the only thing I'm listening to.  It is mesmerizing.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|This is the best CD I've purchased in a long while.  It arrived about a week ago and I don't think I have listened to anything else since!  The fact that it's a soundtrack for the equally amazing book is only one of the positives.  This can stand on it's own and thrive.  It blows all other Crue incarnations completely out of the water!  It is very moving and rockin' all at the same time.  I highly recommend this to people of all ages!
0375831002|5.0|\\"A human doesn't have a heart like mine. The human heart is a line, whereas my own is a circle, and I have the endless ability to be in the right place at the right time. The consequence of this is that I'm always finding humans at their best and worst. I see their ugly and their beauty, and I wonder how the same thing can be both.\\"    So muses the narrator of Markus Zusak's powerful and moving bestselling novel of 2006, THE BOOK THIEF, which is now out in paperback. As you might guess, this is no ordinary narrator. The contemplative first person guiding you through this book is Death, an at-once fitting and ironic vanguard for a tale that both celebrates the power of words and agonizes over the consequences of their use.    Set against the tragedy-stained canvas of World War II, Death tells the story of young Liesel Meminger (the eponymous book thief) growing up in Nazi Germany under the watchful eye of a staunch foster mother and kindly foster father who teaches her to read. She attends meetings of the BDM, a youth group aimed at indoctrinating young girls into Hitler's ideology. She plays soccer with the boys on her street, holding her own in any disputes that arise. And all the while, dreams of her dead brother haunt and goad her into a fascination with reading and words that inevitably leads to her life of crime.    As she settles into her new home, Liesel befriends Rudy Steiner, a boy her age who becomes known for his love of Olympic runner Jesse Owens (Rudy paints himself black and runs through the town's streets). Together, they navigate the confusing world set before them by the adults in their lives and attempt to come to terms with the racism prevalent in their homeland's current political state. Liesel also makes the acquaintance of the mayor's wife, whose pristine library astounds Liesel and becomes an open playground for Liesel's \\"thievery.\\"    It is a meeting with Max Vandenburg, a 24-year-old Jewish man being hidden in Liesel's basement by her compassionate foster parents, that alters the course of Liesel's life. Max, too, is haunted by nightmares of a family he lost in the harrowing aftermath of Kristallnacht. Together, Max and Liesel discover a shared love of words that leads to a decisive understanding about the role words play in both bravery and cowardice. Each, in their own way, sets out to use this knowledge to shape the world around them.    While other writers have employed Death as a narrator, Zusak makes his own indelible mark on the technique in the dimensions he gives to the character. Death is simultaneously dispassionate about his work and the impact it can have while striving to understand humanity's resilience. Death boasts an omniscience of what will happen in life but also a naivety about what can happen in the human heart.    In the ultimate expression of his dichotomous theme, Zusak creates a touching love letter to books and writing, framed in arguably the most horrific period in human history. But his greatest triumph is delivering a reminder that no writer enters this world quietly. Writers are born of eruptions and detonations, and the truly exceptional ones, like Zusak, continue to channel these explosive energies to craft a truly remarkable book that will be admired for generations.        --- Reviewed by Brian Farrey
B0000AK7AA|1.0|How can ANYBODY call this a family film???  Language (bi***), father in a drunken stupor, attempted murder, and an overall poor story.  Thank the gods I checked this out at the library and didnt pay money for this thing.  Definitely not for my family, anyway.  Read a good book together.

B000KRN67C|4.0|Ya know this band has ALOT of albums and they all sound very different...This is more agressive and darker then there last couple, less experimental and just great melodic dark/black metal...one of the most original albums of 2007.
B0009A21R6|5.0|Wow.  This is an amazing 5.1 SACD mix.  I don't have much to add to all the praise it's received already, but this album is a must buy for anyone who has a 5.1 SACD system.  It is so good, definitely in my top 3 or 5 SACDs in my collection.  Sound quality is great, and the separation of instruments in the channels is awesome and does not alter the original audio dynamics (e.g. no new dominant instruments, etc.).  I enjoy listening to this multichannel mix as much as I enjoy Dark Side of the Moon, Avalon, and Violator.  A must have for any SACD fan!
B000003TAL|4.0|I can guess that this was very innovative at the time, and a big step forward for that kind of post-punk sound.  It holds up well, and is definitely a good album, I just have a hard time really getting into it.  The production's a little lo-fi by today's standards, and I think there's an overall lack of polish.  Some people may like that, which is fine, I just like music crafted with a little more care.  It's a little too long for the amount of ideas it has, and can seem like just a lot of detuned guitars prattling together.  It all sounds pretty good, but not much of it really demands my full attention.  It's totally fine to have on in the background when you're doing something else, but I can't really see myself dedicating too much of my spare time to it.  Not to belittle the album, though.  There's plenty to like about it.    \\"Teen Age Riot\\" is a nice catchy opener, despite being almost seven minutes in length.  \\"The Sprawl\\" is the first song featuring the female vocalist, and is pretty nice until the two minutes of feedback at the end.  I think the whole record would be better if it was just tightened up quite a bit.  \\"Cross the Breeze\\" is one of the most enjoyable on the album with a hard, frenetic pace.  \\"Total Trash\\" is an interesting song with a melody that breaks down and comes to a halt as it goes on.  \\"Kissability\\" is the shortest actual song at barely over three minutes, and pretty enjoyable.  \\"Trilogy\\" is a three part epic that starts hard and fast, slows down for a while, and then picks up again for the finish.  It kind of encapsulates the entire album, interesting in parts but a little too long for its own good.

I found him to be humorous, which makes for great reading and helps me to remember details when presented in that format.

B00005JKEZ|5.0|This film is a Warner Brothers tour de force.  The sum of the parts ach-  ieve near perfection.  Beginning with a timeless story which captures the  imaginations of kids and grown ups alike, is a fairly auspicious start.   Add a superb cast, music by the pre-eminent composer Erich Korngold and  color so vivid, it transcends the boundries of routine movies to a purer  realm of fantasy.  The costumes, sets, editing and direction are all top   notch.  Everyone who contributes to the final product of Robin Hood, is at  the top of their form.  Do yourself a great service, get this movie and show it to as many friends  and family you can.
B000002KCC|1.0|This album's reputation is legendary, no doubt.  But is it really as good as everyone says it is?  Not really.  The songs are, for the most part, mediocre, especially in light of Young's first four solo albums, \\"Deja Vu\\" and Buffalo Springfield.  The playing is inept and lifeless and the singing is abysmal.  Young's voice is strained and off-key for most of the album which does nothing to enhance material that isn't very good to start with.<br /><br />You don't even get very many original songs....\\"Tonight's the Night\\" is played twice for no apparent reason and \\"Borrowed Tune\\" is the Rolling Stones \\"Lady Jane\\" with new lyrics--bad ones.  The Stones, bizarrely, aren't credited as co-composers.<br /><br />Some of the material was not even intended for this project.  The best track, \\"Come on Baby Let's go Downtown\\" was recorded years earlier at a Crazy Horse concert....This track has taken it's rightful place now on the excellent \\"Live at Fillmore\\" record.  The second best track, \\"New Mama\\" was intended for CSNY's \\"Human Highway\\" album.  I'm grateful that this song found a home somehere--too bad it had to be here!<br /><br />The rest of the album, 9 tracks in all, are wretched.<br /><br />The reputation of this album is utterly without foundation.  It seems to have gained a solid reputation BECAUSE it's so bad...as if \\"bad\\" is really good in this case.  The album is rated highly because everyone, Neil Young included, SAYS it's good---you just have to \\"understand it\\".  If you don't get it, you're not cool...something like that.<br /><br />If you ask me, this \\"Emperor of Wyoming\\" has no clothes.  It's about time someone finally pointed it out!
B000URDEB0|5.0|I've been watching their video diary and all the things the guys went through right after firing Tarja. It has been a long time since Once and I was hoping this change would be for the better. I liked Once okay, but not nearly as well as Oceanborn. Tarja's voice is something to behold and I've never heard another band in this genre that even comes close. However, her voice isn't the only thing. The music is just in a class of it's own and it doesn't matter if William Hung is singing it, the music is still great.<br /><br />So now I finally get to hear Anette. I was wondering what the guys, particularly Tuomas would do to change the fact that Tarja is not there any more. So, I put the CD in and gave it a listen on the way home from work the other day. All I can say is WOW!<br /><br />Anette, I don't care what anyone else says about you, you ROCK! You are NOT Tarja, you are Anette and bring Nightwish to a whole new level. But that's not all, the music is just outstanding. Tuomas, Emppu, and Marco composed the music, mostly Tuomas of course, and by letting Emppu and Marco have some input, I head a much more varied and interesting album than Once.<br /><br />After hearing Anette, I really don't miss Tarja all that much. Tarja was great, but Anette has a depth and soul that really improves Nightwish's sound. It is not better than the old sound, it is just different and absolutely rocking.<br /><br />My favorites are the opening suite Poet and Pendulum, the hard rocking Emppu track Whoever Brings the Night, and Marco's track The Islander.<br /><br />This is good stuff by a band that has no one to compare it to. Highly recommended.
0671004107|3.0|I chose to read this book for my book report in school. It has a captivating plot about science and religion intertwined in one story. Why can't religion and science be in the same book. I think religion proves science and science proves religion. Why can't God have created and follow the rules of science.    The story had a great plot and had good meaning, but was bland and dull through one third of the book. Carl Sagan would go off for pages talking about things that are irrelevant to the story and disrupts the flow of the events.    All in all, the \\"Contact\\" was good, but could be revised and be made into a more captivating and intriguing story.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|Few weeks of use and I already like this calculator a lot. I came from a non-RPN mode calculator, but actually like RPN. It think this is because I have Computer Science background. I can see why some users dislike this feature. I think the manual is required reading for any MBA/CFA/CPA, or anyone who own or handles significant money for their company/self.   The manual is excellent although a bit verbose because it refers to unary and binary operators as \\"one number function\\" and \\"two number functions\\". Also it refers to \\"pop\\" operation as \\"stack lift\\". In any case read it, its very useful!  The Schweser company strongly recommends the TI BAII Plus. Not sure why, because TI calculator need an awful lot of key strokes. Also the TA makes an assumption that the compounding monthly-- that's only true for simple mortgage or bond problems. The only annoyance I found with 12c, is that it rounds up (ceiling) for the value of N. You will have to learn to work around that.

I love this album this the best greatest hits CD released in a while.I think the second disc is a mixed bag a lot good remixes and some bad ones.But the album as a whole is excellent.
0805209999|5.0|The Trial, by Kafka, is superb work only short of masterpiece because it was never finished. I read the book a few months ago, but it still can give me the shivers when I reflect on the brutal, impersonal environment with which  K., the main character, is persecuted. When suspected of a crime, the accused must defend themselves but are not revealed the nature of the crime they committed. This is the dark, helpless world K. is subjugated to.  Many times the book feels dreamy as if K. could wake up -- but he can't.

For those professionals out there pondering the all important question; this product will NOT speed up your workflow. Having to move your hand back and forth between the keyboard and this joystick will only break your workflow, especially if you use keyboard shortcuts extensively.    What this product does is merely replace the \\"sticky key\\" viewport functionality in programs like Maya and 3D Studio Max, and in my opinion it's no faster.  I would only recommend this product for use in programs that don't already have accurate viewport navigation built in.

Probably the only difference being the \\"L\\" instead of our $ symbol.  Who cares, right?  It has the same exact story inside!  Well, I care.

B000IOM0YM|5.0|I have long resisted buying anything other than CDs (and the occasional Tshirt) by KISS because I would get the odd feeling that somewhere Gene Simmons was ringing up a demonic cash register and once again gloating over how he had bilked another few bucks out of unwitting fans.  I must say, though, that this first KISSOLOGY compilation is, warts and all, well worth the investment for fans wanting to gather together the glorious early years of KISS in one comprehensive collection.  Found among the true gems are miles of precious concert footage, much of which falls victim to the wear and tear of time, but still conveys the true rock and roll bombast and hellfire coolness that this band brought into being.   You get their early TV appearances, when hapless old school actors roll their eyes at it all; you get to watch their show grow and expand and find that from almost day one, these guys had a strong work ethic and threw themselves into everything they did -- they had something to prove and did it everytime they played.   Also included is the bizarre trip to Cadillac, Michigan, the Brit/doc So It Goes, excerpts from The Paul Lynde Halloween Special, and more (be sure to find those hidden \\"easter eggs\\"!)  The music, of course, is incredible, hard rock fed on the edgier side of '60's pop/rockers like The Who, The Kinks, Cream, the Stones, and late era Beatles. Underneath all that smoke and screaming were some catchy as hell tunes.  There are some annoying minuses though: The band apparently felt they should stick it to Peter by not including his performance of \\"Beth\\" from the aforementioned Paul Lynde Special, leaving fans out in the cold as a result.   Also, the audio commentary is scant at best, and basically is the same as what can be found in the booklet that accompanies the set. It would also have been nice to have Ace and Peter add a thought or two on the commentary, but such is the nature of EGO. And I suppose that one has to take that with a grain of salt: it was those egos that found their fullest expressions in the personaes that graced those stages so many years ago and gave so much pleasure to those of us old enough to have tasted it. The crazy, crazy ride started here - a ride worth taking again and again!

B000KCHZK6|5.0|I have grown to appreciate this cd more with each listen.  The songs are lovely and original, and there are so many phenomenal and talented musicians backing Ms. Jones on this cd.  I love the sound of the cello in \\"Broken\\", the delicate sound of a string section in \\"Not Too Late\\", the plethora of instruments and sounds in \\"Sinkin' Soon\\", and the imagery and moodiness of \\"The Sun Doesn't Like You\\".  Each song is special and unique. You won't hear alot of these songs on Top 40 radio, but in this case, that is a GOOD thing!

B00005JN2Z|5.0|Michael Mann is one of the top action/thriller directors working today, and COLLATERAL only serves to confirm his stature. After HEAT (which frames a classic confrontation between DeNiro and Pacino in a movie that was a symphony of violence and introspection), Mann takes two more exceptional actors in Cruise and Foxx, and sets them against each other in the confines of a taxicab. The driver Max (Foxx), a loser who dreams of paradise, is the hostage of existentialist contract killer Vincent (Cruise), who first tricks and then forces Max into chauffering him around LA as he executes his bloody tasks.  Full of Mann's prototypical and wry observations, and beautifully photographed, edited and scored, the movie grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go. Probably Tom Cruise's finest performance ever, as he reaches inside to extract a psychotic darkness and animal intelligence that redefines him as an actor.
0393312836|5.0|An amazingly creative, engrossing novel. I thought in Nadsat for weeks. I must say that I disliked the glossary in the back, and didn't use it. That sort of colloquialism is subjective, and trying to define it reduces its meaning. The final chapter was kind of a throw -- not sure how I liked it, but Burgess is a master storyteller -- he really makes you interested in a perverse, completely insane person.
0307387178|3.0|Into the wild is a book bordering on genius and insanity much like the people written so passionately in it's pages. The book is a great read for sure but whether or not it is a good thing is hard to say. I feel cheated. After seeing the preview for the movie I hoped for an inspirational book but after reading the cover I realized that wasn't going to be the case. It is written like an article and not a story. That made it feel more real and at the same time ruined the beautiful story with reality. Hopefully this book will deter people from tempting the fates to escape what they'll miss the most in the end.
6305511055|5.0|Spy stories have come a long way.<br /><br />In the 1950s and 1960s, it was all about the Soviets. (Oh, for the days when we knew our enemy so well!) In the 1960s, we also started seeing Bond movies, which were heavily about the Russians, but also about different (if often ridiculous) enemies.<br /><br />However, I've always felt that the 1970s was a truly great time for spy films. The decade is filled with fantastic spy stories: [[ASIN:B00006A8T4 Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]], [[ASIN:B00005M2CO Marathon Man]], [[ASIN:B000CEXEWA All the President's Men (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] and this one: [[ASIN:6305511055 Three Days of the Condor]].<br /><br />In \\"Three Days\\", a young man (played by Robert Redford) works for the CIA as a book reader. Essentially, he and his co-workers are paid to read books and write reports on possible leaks, tactics and other things. (I would love to have that job!) One day, he goes out for lunch and comes back to find everyone in his office murdered. Thus begins a three-day run, wherein Redford's character tries to keep himself alive to find out who's behind the murders.<br /><br />Interestingly, in \\"Three Days\\", we started to see a different breed of spy story: one in which our own government is a suspect almost immediately.<br /><br />The film is taut, exciting and has great performances by both Redford and Faye Dunaway.
0300108834|1.0|This book was worse than bad - it is well-written misinformation that will leave the reader thinking he or she has been well-informed.  Clearly written from a Christian perspective, the author bends and twists history to the breaking point to make it fit his world-view.  In this book, all of the historical claims of the bible are accepted as fact, when many are in dispute or are seriously doubted by serious historians.  Characters of the Old Testament that may have never existed, and events that may have never happened are presented as if they have as much legitimacy as secular history.  At one point, the author claims that the Dark Ages were actually more like a starry night because the people of Europe had the guiding light of \\"their Lord\\" shining on them.  Ugh!<br /><br />In addition, the author characterizes other historical figures in overly romantic terms.  Alexander, Julius Caesar and Augustus are spoken of with great reverance, with little notice of their brutal, amoral behavior.  Modern historians understand that history is written by the winners, and take a dim view of simply assuming that powerful world figures were as noble and wise as their propanganda claimed.<br /><br />This is history for people who don't want their worldview challenged - even by the truth - if they learned most of their history before 1975.  If you want to actually learn something useful, look elsewhere.
B0006SSOHC|1.0|Ok, this movie is so stupid. It is not a scary movie AT ALL. It was boring, predictable, and only had a few moments that were really suspenseful. I can't believe that there's been three sequels from this movie. I mean, come on!!
0618680004|5.0|While this book may not change your beliefs, it can definitely have the effect of forcing you to challenge your assumptions.  The role of religion in our society is examined under a harsh light, and the logic used by religious organizations when trying to convert children or influence secular laws is called into question.  Dawkins leaves very little wiggle room for a rational person to accept any sort of religious rationale for morality or laws.    Dawkins is not asking the reader not to believe in God - just to understand that society and the rational mind function best when religious ideas that have no basis in sound logic or solid evidence are left out of the equation.     Worth reading, regardless of your viewpoint.
0143038419|4.0|Well, this book certainly has a lot to live up to.  While I don't know if it changed my life, it held my interest, made me laugh and made me cry.  And let's face it, it has a cute cover.
0807126063|4.0|There are two ways of perceiving Cervantes's \\"Don Quixote.\\"  In the modern interpretation Don Quixote is an idealistic dreamer, a hopeless romantic battling the windmills of a bitter, cynical world.  The more traditional (and I'd say correct) interpretation is that Don Quixote is a dangerous madman adhering to an outdated ideology and sowing havoc wherever he goes.  Based on which interpretation you believe in, the novel can be seen as charmingly comic or darkly comic.<br /><br />The same can be said for \\"A Confederacy of Dunces.\\"  Ignatius Reilly is Don Quixote of the bayou, a grossly overweight, strangely dressed believer in Medieval philosophy.  He espouses these beliefs in notebooks, to his mother, at the movie theater (to the annoyance of patrons, ushers, and managers), and to any perspective employer.  The only one close to understanding him might have been his dead collie, whom he loves in a not-entirely healthy way.  The second closest is his former girlfriend--using the term loosely--Myrna Minkoff, an heiress turned political activist from New York.<br /><br />Reilly's mother caters to his every need--such as supporting him through the better part of a decade of college, though it never leads him to a stable job--until she runs her car into a building while drunk.  This leads her to forcing Reilly out into the world.  His interactions with employees at a pants factory, a hot dog vendor, a gay man in the French Quarter, and a bar's employees create mayhem for Reilly and those he comes into contact with.<br /><br />I think the prevailing view is to think of Ignatius Reilly as a madcap fish out of water, the idealistic dreamer interpretation.  But it's not hard to also see him as a fat, selfish lout deserving of the scorn and ridicule he receives.  Clearly Ignatius Reilly--like Don Quixote--is someone who takes himself and his ridiculously out-of-step views far too seriously, so you're never laughing WITH him so much as laughing AT him.  It's up to you to decide just how mean-spirited the laughing at part is.<br /><br />At any rate, it's unfortunate that John Kennedy Toole did not live long enough to hone his craft a bit more.  Had he received some support and guidance he could have been one of the great American authors of his generation with the likes of Vonnegut, Updike, and of course Walker Percy, who at least made sure we could all read this novel.  As it is, there are still some kinks in this, like how people are always screaming relatively ordinary lines of dialog or how the gay characters are stereotyped queens and butches.<br /><br />Still, there's no question this is a good novel, and a funny novel as well, which is why it managed to endure even after the death of its author.  NO matter how you should interpret it, you should read it.<br /><br />On a side note, I think if Ignatius Reilly were around in modern times he would be writing his missives on the Internet instead of in notebooks.  Mostly likely he'd be writing reviews on Amazon...<br /><br />That is all.de just how mean-spirited the laughing at part is.<br /><br />At any rate, it's unfortunate that John Kennedy Toole did not live long enough to hone his craft a bit more.

B000URDEB0|5.0|I've heard all of the rhetoric about how Nightwish just isn't Nightwish without Tarja.  And I would agree... if you were talking about the albums before, and right at, \\"Wishmaster\\".  Honestly, the last two full studio albums Tarja recorded with Nightwish were rather bland affairs.  And I don't blame the band so much as I didn't feel she was giving enough.    So, now Tarja's out, and Annette's in.  I will admit to being nervous about the change, and the promo videos for \\"Dark Passion Play\\" didn't quite work for me.  (You may be a singer, but you ain't no dancer, Annette.  Heh!)  But now that I gave \\"Dark Passion Play\\" a shot, I think it's earned my full rating.  I won't go on about individual track ratings; just know that this really feels like THE Nightwish album I've been waiting for since I first heard \\"Wishmaster\\".  Annette's vocals may not be as \\"epic\\", but she has a fantastic voice.  And you can tell the core band went into this album with a renewed energy, because every song leaves its own impression, and doesn't feel as blended-in with each other.  (This was my biggest complaint about \\"Once\\".  Well... That, and every other song sounded like set-up for a silly Epic movie.)      Please, do take my example, and just don't be nervous about the change.  Believe me, it was for the better, and now I'm a full Nightwish fan, all over again.

0786838655|5.0|This book was FANTASTIC! As a huge Harry Potter fan, I have been searching for a new series and this one has certainly taken Harry's place. The weaving of Greek mythology through out the story was engrossing and you come to love  Percy, Grover and Annabeth just as much as Ron, Hermonie and Harry...at least I have. These books are totally different than the Harry Potter books, but Riordan has created the same type of \\"magical\\" story telling that Rowling fans love. I have read all the books now and I anxiously await book 4!
068817776X|3.0|This book wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either. This woman was smart, but the tale could have been told better so that there was a bit more profoundness in it.
0061146307|4.0|This series is more a triumph of marketing and presentation than an actual literary achievement. From Lemony Snicket's dire warnings on the back cover to the stylized illustrations and old fashioned fonts, the idea is to present a work of Gothic children's fiction that falls somewhere between Roald Dahl and Edgar Allen Poe.<br /><br />The actual story is a little less satisfying, often because it isn't really as dark and twisted and it suggests itself to be. True, the three children are orphaned in the first chapter, and yes, their third cousin the evil Count Olaf hatches various evil schemes to steal their fortune and probably kill them, but it's all a little watered-down. I'm a little too old for the books anyway, but I can remember the kind of stories I enjoyed when I was a child. Maybe some children genuinely enjoy stories where everything works out in the end and all the characters are nice and happy and love each other, but good stories, whether they're for children or grown-ups, always have conflict, and the best adventures always place their heroes in serious jeopardy. Even fairy tales.<br /><br />I actually prefer reading about A Series of Unfortunate Events over reading the actual books. Even so, they are funny, frequently inventive, and just a little bit dark and morbid, which is enjoyable. It's also nice to see a modern children's series that doesn't try to be the next Harry Potter -- meaning a story with many characters and details and lengthy volumes and an epic scope. These novels are short, easily read, and don't try too hard, which is sometimes exactly the way a novel should be.<br /><br />The paperback editions add even more to the \\"presentation\\": an old-fashioned black and white comic about a pair of child detectives, a collection of vintage advertisements, an advice column penned by Mr. Snicket, and a hilarious serialized \\"nonsense novel\\" written circa 1910.

0786939532|4.0|I've read a lot of fantasy novels in the past 10 years. Some of my favorites are Robert E.Howard's Conan , The(original) Dragonlance Novels by Weis and Hickman, Lord of the Ring to name a few . OF all the 50-60 fantasy novels Ive read I'd say about 10% are great and 30% are pretty good. There are a lot of not so good fantasy novels out there.<br />So I thought I'd give The Dark Elf Series a try. I try to research a series and its author before I begin one. After reading many reviews of this book from Amazon and other outlets I had mixed feelings to what this book might be.<br />Well....<br />Its a great story. Full of action with a rich plot. The realm the writer conjures is deep with dark and ancient evil, mystery, and suspence. There are a few typos.Not a huge issue.<br />But over all I give it 4 stars. I can not wait to read part 2 Exile!<br /><br />PROS:<br />Strong plot<br />Lots of well described action<br />Dark and Evil Magic<br />Well fleshed out characters<br />Good ending<br />CONS:<br />Some typos<br />Idea behind main character is a bit hard to swallow at times<br />is a bit too short<br />Print too small (this copy only)
B000EYK4KI|4.0|Despite being a fun and sexy romp, Mr. and Mrs. Smith will probably go down in history as the film that made Brad Pitt go from Jennifer Aniston to Angelina Jolie. Like a lot of films, the press behind it seemed to interest more people than the actual film itself, although it did a good number at the box office. While it's a bit problematic, this film wasn't designed to get your kleenex going or your mind working; it just wants to have fun and fun it has. This is the unrated edition so there's more stuff put in (or in some cases, taken out) but by and large, it's still the same rollickingly fun movie.    While in Columbia, John and Jane meet and soon a relationship blossoms and they get married. But despite being insanely attractive, they don't really get along but seeing as how they're both hired assassins for separate agencies with none the wiser about the other's \\"real\\" profession, it's a good thing. But soon they find out and want to kill each other until there's a hit put out on the 2 of them so they have to team up and survive together and maybe even fall in love, and for real this time.    Whether the meeting of the co-stars did result in the breakup of a marriage, you have to admit these 2 have huge time chemistry on-screen; so much so that the idea that their sex life is on the fritz seems almost laughable. It's also good that their acting is up to snuff and while they don't feel like completely realized characters, they more than pull it off. There's also some roles by always likable Adam Brody and scene-stealer Vince Vaughn.    The action scenes are the highlight although they're none too inventive (although, the use of the dual sliding doors on SUV's was funny) but that's what we came to see: people getting shot at in MTV-style moves. My one complaint is that certain plot elements seem dropped, like the writer didn't want to write TOO much for the movie so he just wrote the bare minimum, even if certain things don't even get explained. But then again, this is a movie meant to be a blockbuster \\"good times had by all\\" kind of movie so it's kind of hard to complain when that was the point, no?    It might not be the best action movie of that year or any year but if you ever pick it up, you might just enjoy yourself which is the whole point.

1593080220|5.0|\\"Howards End\\" commences with that famous, cryptic epigraph - \\"Only connect.\\"  Although this masterpiece delves into a multitude of themes, including class struggle and suffragism, the idea of \\"connecting\\" runs throughout brilliantly.  Indeed, the characters in this novel display various levels of success in \\"connecting,\\" both interpersonally and intrapersonally.<br /><br />The novel primarily concerns the Schlegel sisters - sociable Helen and the more practical Margaret.  The sisters live in comfort in London (circa 1900) along with their passive brother, Tibby.  As members of the leisure class (they inherited money from their parents), the Schlegels spend much of their time mulling over \\"big issues.\\"  Margaret and Helen, for example, belong to a women's social club which discuss how to help the poor and other humanitarians themes.  In other words, they're forward-thinkers but not much on action.<br /><br />Their world views are challenged when they become entangled with two quite divergent families - the impoverished Basts and the nouveau riche Wilcoxes.  The Schlegels initially are attracted to Leonard Bast, an imaginative clerk who seems worthy of far greater things than his lowly job hints.  They debate about how best to help Leonard, but their assistance turns into meddling of the worst sort.  In contrast, the sisters are rather repulsed by Henry Wilcox, the head of the family and a distant businessman who seemingly has no internal life.  The sisters find their beliefs and loyalties to each other tested severely when they become involved with these families.<br /><br />\\"Howards End\\" is among Forster's best work, along with \\"A Passage to India\\" and ahead of \\"A Room with a View\\" and \\"Where Angels Fear to Tread.\\"  The characters are largely what make this book such a treat, although \\"Howards End\\" is buoyed by an astonishingly intricate plot as well.  The main mystery concerns who will ultimately inherit Howards End, the Wilcox's somewhat stodgy country home; however, the house is a thinly veiled substitute for Imperial England herself.  Indeed, Forster seems to be imploring, \\"Who will inherit England?\\"  Forster's denouement answers this question most subtly.  As is likely to be true for many readers of this book, I viewed the extraordinary movie version of \\"Howards End\\" many years and numerous times before picking up this novel.  The novel is, not surprisingly, even deeper and more thought-provoking than the movie. \\"Howards End\\" is first-rate, exhilarating literature.a thinly veiled substitute for Imperial England herself.

1594489505|5.0|I know a lot about the history of Afghanistan, because I was a History major and also after 9/11 we all learned, the hard way!  This was an amazing book, I loved the story.   I did not cry, as my friend who recommended the book did.  The reason is, the story of these two ladies, is very common in this part of the world. It made me MAD and I was disgusted.  Didn't our President tell us that we were rebuilding Afghanistan?   How, as Americans, have we not been disgusted prior to 9/11 and after our President and his so-called advisor's, took most of the troops and sent them to Iraq.  Afghanistan is a mess again, the warlords have taken over and the opium growth is as high as it was in the 90's.      Everyone should read this book.  It is a great story, well written.  The historical accuracy is great.  It is a sad story, but one that is true.      My problem, is that there are still problems in Afghanistan.  When are we going to help the people that need it most???  For any of you who don't like what I said about Bush, well I voted for him two times.  I was a registered Republican until 2006.    I pray that this book will promote and help the cause of the Afghan woman  and they get the rights that we do in America!
1400032717|4.0|From the first person perspective of an autistic teenager, the book's story is, at first, structured around a mystery.  This, in itself, is unique.  But the book is truly remarkable primarily for its ability to capture the character of its narrator.  The character really comes alive, and his thought processes, while foreign, are realistic and intriguing.  I was quite impressed.  The book's author, Mark Haddon, creates a truly three-dimensional character, well-rounded, real, and interesting.<br /><br />Please note:  this book focuses its pages on developing real characters with realistic though processes.  As a result, the book largely lingers in the narrator's head; there is a lot of thought and not so much action.  I do NOT mean to suggest that there are no action sequences!  There are, and some of them are quite dramatic.  Still, while the narrator remained interesting for the duration of the book, and while I cared about him and his struggles, I did periodically desire to read about more action and less thought.  This is, of course, mere personal preference.  Overall, it was a great book.

B000SO7OMA|5.0|To listen to Loreena's music is one thing; to see her perform live is quite another. Just yesterday evening, in Cleveland Ohio, my family and I attended her performance. We all agreed that this may have been the best live event we'd ever been to. The only thing that would have made it better would have been the context of the Granada, Spain location. If you are a fan, or even a casual fan, as myself, you will move heaven and earth to make her live event in your area. It was an amazing experience and I am so glad I decided to go. Make sure you ask to be granted a \\"meet and greet\\" after the show; they do let the first ten who ask meet her on her way back to her tour bus. She will take time to sign your concert programm or CD/DVD...whatever. My 16 year old niece got to fullfill one of her dreams to actually meet and give a gentle hug (with permission) to Loreena. She does appreciate her fans and my family apprecaites her for taking the time after the show to let us get closer. Make sure to get this DVD/CD combo; I bought one after the show to remember the live event. It is a must have.

Although I reiterate all the great reviews below, I have one packaging gripe:  the original non-U.S. version of this c.d. had much more extensive (Bowie penned) liner notes plus some interesting photos and different cover art.      The notes that accompany the current re-release are seriously truncated in comparison to the English/European version which is now apparently quite difficult to obtain.    If you are interested in the artist's more detailed observations and explanations regarding this recording, I'm sure that with some digging you'll find them somewhere on the web, but Virgin should have used the original notes.  Nonetheless, the music stands on it's own as an album that exemplifies that which makes Bowie's catalogue so rewarding.
1881273156|4.0|Even though I am not of Christian faith, I have found that discovering these Five Languages has immediately benefited me.  I understand my husband, children, and friends with greater awareness and a deeper appreciation for who they are, while also understanding myself much better.  I feel more confident to 'speak' from my personal 'Love Language' and can receive others' Love Language with more receptivity.     Originally, my hairdresser told me of this book. She was so enthusiastic about it that she was able to describe these five languages in an understandable way for me to begin talking about this concept to family and friends.  As I discussed this more and more, I realized the need to pick up the book and read it.      I recommend this book to anyone interested in gaining greater awareness of self and others.
B0000089FS|3.0|This is a lot better than the dire Leather Jackets that preceded it by a few years, but I would say this is album for completists only. Some of the songs are quite good, noteably 'Heavy Traffic' and 'I don't wanna go on with you like that' which is the best track on the album by some margin. However for me the benchmark for Elton John albums is whether it has a great song on it. When I say a great song I mean a song that will stand the test of time like 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road' 'Your Song' or 'Border Song' or more recently 'This Train don't stop there anymore'. Sadly the answer is no, although 'I don't wanna...' goes close.<br /><br />Like a previous reviewer said the absence of real Piano is another sore point for me. If you get an Elton John album that has no real Piano on it, its like buying an Eric Clapton album with no Guitar on it. Sure this has some sythesized electronic Piano like sounds but not real Piano. The other major problem for me is that this being recorded in 1988 its horribly over-produced, full of droning uneccessary background keyboards and drums which were apparently played by Charlie Morgan, but frequently sound like a drum machine. Listen to the beginning of 'The camera never lies' - hideous....<br /><br />So its not the worst by a long way, but before you buy this you should buy all the 70's albums (except for 'Victim of Love'), 'Two Low For Zero', 'Sleeping with the past', 'Songs from the West Coast' and 'The Captain and the kid'.

B000BHN7D4|5.0|No skipping tracks on this one.  What a great collection--What a voice!  Anastacia is like Mary J. Blige's white sister.  A lil less funk but smoother soul.  MMMM MMMMMM....... AND she writes her own music.  I echo the comments of others saying its a shame she isn't more highly regarded in the United States.  Too many others with FAR less talent lower America's expectations and dumb down the music (I'm looking at you Fergie).
0743289684|5.0|In \\"Infidel,\\" the brilliant and beautiful freethinker Ayaan Hirsi Ali cuts through the irrational rationalization of the world's most brutal and oppressive ideology:  Not \\"radical Islam,\\" but ISLAM, period.  And Hirsi Ali should know, because, as she explains in her autobiography, she was for many years a VERY DEVOUT MUSLIM.  As an outward expression of her ardent devotion to Islam and its god Allah - even before it became more \\"fashionable\\" where she lived in Africa - Hirsi Ali covered herself from head to toe in a baggy cloak so that her femaleness would not be revealed and endanger her to the ubiquitous perils for women in her culture.  As we should already recognize from seeing the abuse with our own eyes, the fervent claim that Islam does NOT oppress women - frequently quite violently - represents one of the biggest deceits in the world today, and those who constantly put forth this palpably false assertion dismissing gender-apartheid within Islam should be loudly denounced.  But the highly important work of Hirsi Ali goes much farther than simply denouncing the incredibly hideous treatment of women within Islam, as Ayaan undoubtedly represents one of the greatest voices of reason of all time in a battle for the very existence of human civilization.<br /><br />Horribly mutilated at the age of five at the harsh hands of her stern grandmother and a local barber with a pair of scissors who cut off her genitals like a slab of meat, Ayaan Hirsi Ali speaks out loudly and clearly that such atrocities in her native Somalia are done not only to virtually EVERY female of a certain age, but also IN THE NAME OF ISLAM.  In fact, it was surprising for her to discover that there are claims - many quite frantic and unconvincing - that Islam does NOT call for female genital mutilation or \\"circumcision,\\" as this despicable \\"cultural tradition\\" is euphemistically and flaccidly termed.  Of course, not only Muslims practice this heinous savagery, but the majority of women and girls with disfigured genitals - an estimated 140 MILLION worldwide at the time of this writing - ARE Muslims, and such oppressive barbarism goes hand in hand with an ideology that without a doubt considers women as second-class subhumans designed mostly for sexual release, baby making and household slavery.<br /><br />Needless to say, someone with such intelligence and wisdom as Ayaan Hirsi Ali was not content to spend her precious life merely as a piece of meat and slave.  Hirsi Ali escaped this oppressive and dreadful future - and found a liberating and exquisite non-Muslim world that she could barely have imagined, based on the virulent infidel-hating dogma she had been taught since childhood.  Although she would likely not opine that the non-Muslim world is perfect by any means, Hirsi Ali's vivid and disturbing descriptions of the contrast between what she left behind and what she discovered must give serious pause to the myriad and often trivial complaints against Western civilization.  As she has said in interviews, YOU may spit upon the freedoms you were born with, but she cannot be so unappreciative and disrespectul, because she has literally experienced and witnessed REAL hell on Earth, and she is extremely grateful to have gotten out.  By contrast, Western values at this current time seem like paradise - this notion is precisely what Hirsi Ali has attempted to impart over and over again in her writings and interviews.  In other words, we've got it not just good but GREAT.  And this greatness is well worth fighting for - nay, it is ESSENTIAL we fight for it.<br /><br />Despite the denials and justifications by those who cannot or will not face the horrible truth, the threat against the very survival of Western civilization is real, large and growing.  If we do not wake up to this threat quickly, we will very likely find ourselves living in a world of submission and enslavement that we cannot even conceive.  Hirsi Ali knows these facts to be true, as she has already lived through such a nightmare - and SHE DOES NOT WANT TO GO BACK.  We who are enlightened cannot blame her at all, as we absolutely do not wish such a future for our own children - a perfectly dreadful thought straight out of our worst fears.<br /><br />Do yourself and the world a favor - buy this book, read it, digest it, pass it along and support the efforts of the handful of individuals such as Ayaan Hirsi Ali in saving human civilization.<br /><br />Acharya S<br />Author, \\"[[ASIN:0932813747 The Christ Conspiracy: The Greatest Story Ever Sold]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:1931882312 Suns of God: Krishna, Buddha and Christ Unveiled]],\\" and \\"Who Was Jesus?

0143038419|1.0|I was truly disappointed at the book.  I was most upset that this book was on the best seller's list for so long.  The author was self-absorbed, pretentious, insincere, childish...shall I go on?  The writing style was annoying.  Don't waste your money buying the book and support bad literature  by giving her any loyalty fee.  Check it out from the library if you must.
0743486285|5.0|I was a Crue fan in the 80s - like everyone in the 80s. Even better, I was a Nikki Sixx fan. I was young and fairly naive, and while I knew that sex and drugs ruled rock n' roll, the extent of the abuse and horror of it all never occured to me. I've never had an addiction, it's not in my personality (thank God), but I've known a few that have, I've got family who are addicts. This book is incredible and a tremendous contribution. It has helped me understand what is/was possibly going on in the minds of those I know who are/have been addicted to drugs, who feel they just can't get through an hour without them. I'm amazed that the diary entries are so coherent for someone so strung out at the time. I also can't figure out how any of the Crue managed to function at all in the storm of all these drugs. This is a dark book, the illustrations are excellent and they along with the entries themselves never let you relax. I still love Motley Crue, always will. They defined my rock n' roll era. Now that I've read the book, I understand the band's lyrics much better. The music has taken on a deeper meaning now. I've gone back and listened to all my Motley Crue CDs and I've got more appreciation for the music and lyrics now that I've read this book. And having commentary included in the book from Nikki Sixx today as well as the other band members and their crew really gives this book a lot of depth. And while some of it is undeniably funny (the earthquake, the furniture in the elevator) it's also eye opening and sorrowful that one of our most talented rockers went through this. I've never thought drugs were cool and Nikki has just reaffirmed that(now don't get the idea that was a goody-goody; I had my wild side, I loved my alcohol and I dabbled in other things, I just never got hooked on anything and I count myself blessed after reading these diaries). This book is nothing short of extrodinary.     Nikki, it took a lot of guts to publish this book. I read it in a matter of daysand I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. I'm glad you made it through. So many people don't. Hopefully this book will help stop that.
B000UFAURI|4.0|The Foo Fighters have gone in a somewhat new direction on this one.  There are some songs that sound as you would expect on a Foo album and there are some that are quite a bit more mellow.    The lyrics, while good, are a bit too emotional for my tastes, but even still I find that this is a really good listen.
B000024D4R|5.0|Pink Floyd fans tend to be a fanatical, opinionated lot, and I'm no exception.  (I remember that my friends and I considered Dark Side of the Moon a sellout album, because most of the songs contained lyrics!) In any case, as I fill in the holes in my music collection, I find that this album must be present in its entirety, which of course is the way it was designed and released.  Perhaps only one other (Wish You Were Here) approaches the stature of Animals in my mind, and I'm surprised I was able to go a decade or more without hearing the whole opus start to finish.  This is the band at the top of its game, all politics and bombast and good fun.
B000N3SS80|5.0|This is a Beautiful piece of cuban music.  The best I've ever heard.  I do not speak latin/spanish....so I have no idea what she was saying, but it doesn't matter in this case.  Music knows no language & it is so uplifting, you must listen to this music...I Loved It!
0802130208|1.0|I heard that the book was a comic masterpiece so I gave it a try.  After reading the Preface I was prepared to withstand a slow start that was supposed to grow slowly towards a climactic ending (or at least an interesting ending).  A friend of mine was given the book and she tried to get through it 2 or 3 times but she kept getting to a point that she couldn't push through.  I was able to push through because I expected a payoff later on that never came.<br /><br />None of the characters are completely likable.  They are all idiots at one point or another and they repeatedly act in a way that I have trouble believing a normal person would.  If this was a play, television show or a movie I would say that all of the characters were overacting.  They would constantly repeat the same stupid sayings over and over and over again throughout the book.  The whole time I am thinking how unbelievable this dialog is because normal people don't act this way.  This was just stupidity.  It might even be bearable if it was only a couple of screwballs characters but instead everyone is inept.  There was no one to route for or to identify with and it simply was not entertaining to read.<br /><br />The only good thing that I can say about the book is that the title is appropriate.
0743289684|5.0|Ayaan Hirsi Ali's parents should blame themselves for her leaving Islam: they allowed  her to learn to read and attend school with nonbelievers. Any first-rate fundamentalist knows the quickest way to open a mind is to expose it to an outside influence--in Ali's case, \\"trashy\\" novels brought to school. If her parents had home schooled her, she would have become a mother's, father's, brother's, and husband's dream--a good, submissive (hollow) Somali woman.     Ali beautifully traces her conversion, with all its stops and starts, which is the way it happens with most \\"thinking\\" people. It's important to note that she does not want to leave her faith; in fact, she struggles to hold on to it. Her life would have been easier, as in predictable (albeit more painful) if she'd succeeded.        INFIDEL is an influence that will be hard to shake off, and I'm glad of it.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|So of all Michaels albums...this is By FAR the best! It has all the best of older songs with a vibrant new twist with michaels voice. I dont know how most music survived before him...his talent and artist voice has carried tunes that go as far back as 1932. He brings a taste of the past with a brand new future. I freaked out when I watched the new movie \\"Evening\\" and all of a sudden heard the bouncy beat to 'I've got the world on a string' Its nice to hear a modern song in a period piece. This album is a most have for all!
B000VL9XNI|4.0|I think the stuff with Bonn Scott was better because most of it I've never seen.<br />One thing about the new song that were done live you could tell Angus was gettin old cause he wasn't dance around stage as much.<br />One of the best AC/DC trademark songs \\"Let There be Rock\\" & \\"Highway to Hell\\".<br />Bonn Scott seemed to be more at ease when he was on stage, I think he sounds better too.<br />Some of the songs on this DVD are bootlegs so it doesn't sound perfect.<br />You will see some rare live video clips in this DVD.<br />Don't get me wrong I like Brian, I just like Bonn Scott Better.<br />Over all I think if your an AC/DC fan this is a must have.<br />I would rate this box set a 4 of 5 stars!!
B0000C1733|5.0|I've been a fan of RHCP since the late 80's!<br />I love Funk Metal and RHCP are at the top of the game!<br />Breaking the Girl & Give it away are some of their best songs!<br />I would rate this CD a 5 of 5 stars!!
B000O1799U|5.0|Dreamgirls is a musical and a drama. the movie is based on a broadway musical,three young females Deena Jones, Lorell Robinson, and Effie White becomes backup singers for James \\"Thunder\\" Early.When it was time for the girls to sing their own song, Curtis Taylor and Effie' brother C.C., chose Deena to ing the lead part. When Deena becomes lead singer, Effie becomes highly upset. The actors/ actresses in the movie are: Beyonce Knowles, Jennifer Hudson, Eddie Murphy, Danny Glover, Jamie Foxx, Anika Noni Rose, etc. It's a good movie and if you didn't see it, I reccomend you do...
B00006EXL5|5.0|Out of all of there 3 cds this is by far the best one.  raw and full of energy = great combination.  This kicks the pants off the black parade and TCFSR.  I was very shocked at how good this record was and who was the person that called MCR emo?  I was going to pass this record but I heard a couple of songs from it and liked it.  I am new to MCR so yes you can call me a poser because I use to hate this band with a passion but thats all changed.  These guys just get a bad reputation is all.  If you are new to MCR I would listen to a couple of songs first because this cd might take you a few listens to get into it.  I love this cd from start to finish I just wish they could sound like this today but MTV completely changed all that.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|With three former members of a very popular band, Alter Bridge will probably always here the Creed comparisons.  However, this album should really kill that talk.  With Myles being fully incorporated with song writing and guitar playing, this album by far separates itself from any Creed album.  Creed was from a different, more popular album sales type of era.  So Alter Bridge may never surpass the number of records sold (they really should though); however Alter Bridge is already surpassed them for quality music.  `Blackbird' really takes it to another level with a grittier, more intense sound, and a classic hard rock feel!  It is a very well balanced album with some songs with radio friendly type of feel, and some songs that just rock out.  Meaningful lyrics abound throughout the album, and guitar riffs to the max.  FANS OF ROCK SWARM!!!  Alter Bridge's `Blackbird' proves incredible rock bands still survive!!      Ties That Bind       Very good hard rock song.  The song starts with a guitar solo with a very entertaining beat.    Come To Life      Pretty good rock song.  Not one of my favorites, but nothing wrong with it.    Brand New Start       Slightly toned down.  Awesome guitar solo.  Super ballad.     Buried Alive      Very good hard rocking.  A chorus towards the end really picks it up a notch and is very enjoyable.    Coming Home      Hard rocker.  I sense a serious tone to it.  Not bad.  Towards the end the lyrics/pace picks up, which I like.    Before Tomorrow Comes       Slightly toned down, ballad feel.  I love this song.    Rise Today       The first single and a perfect choice.  Radio friendly, rocking, great lyrics.      Break Me Down       Great rocker. This album just continually spits out quality rock songs.             Blackbird       The 8 minute epic!  Very intense.  This song compares and ranks right up there with Zep's \\"Stairway To Heaven,\\" and Pink Floyd's \\"Comfortably Numb;\\" and it may be even better.  It has the meaningful lyrics, great music, invokes feelings.     One By One       This song has really grown on me.  I find myself singing the lyrics in my head.  Strong rocking tune!    Watch Over You      My favorite song.  Softer feel to it, caring lyrics, great tune.  Myles hits a brillant 'Who' high note throughout the song that is flawless and really adds to the song.  I hope it is the next single.    White Knuckles       Top notch rock song, very enjoyable. Great guitar work, very cool sounding main chorus, \\"Only The Strong Survive.\\"    Wayward One       The song kicks!  Great hard rock song!
B00000DQLL|4.0|This is a great CD-single, Off the Ground is a good song, but  Cosmically Conscious is a great song!  Style Style and Sweet Sweet Memories aren't half bad, either.  Soggy Noodle is a 1/2 minute, lightweight instrumental (filler, really)  All in all, a pretty good CD single, in spite of Soggy Noodle.    The mystery is, why isn't the full \\"Cosmically Conscious\\" on the Off the Ground album? (It fades out early in the song.)    Note: When looking for the 5 track single (or really any CD basically), make sure the seller doesn't have the 1-track promo CD of the remixed \\"Off The Ground\\" with the same front cover. Contact the Seller first, making sure their description (or lack thereof) is accurate.   Ask now, save yourself from later hassles.
0792163710|5.0|I'm not usually a fan of Westerns and I never saw Shane until today.  I remember hearing about it and listening to countless people imitating the cries of Brandon de Wilde at the end so I thought it was something to avoid. Last week I found it on the shelf of the public library and only watched it when I had gone through the others.    So, you can imagine my amazement at how wonderful this was.  It is hard for me to really figure out what makes it so good.  Reading quite a few of the readers' reviews maybe helps.  I think it is the mystery of Shane...We don't know his first name, we don't know anything about his past, except what we can glean from his few comments.  He is the classic mysterious hero, almost like an angel, who appears when needed, sacrifices himself, and then leaves just as quickly.    Some people here have commented that Alan Ladd had a tormented life.  I know very little about that, but I'm wondering if that quality brought something special to his performance that made it so gripping.  Shane sublimates his feelings, from his first encounter with the bad guys in the bar, when they taunt him for buying soda pop, to the end...when he rides out of town with blood on him. It's not what he says, but what he doesn't say that gets you.  Underneath that very calm and collected exterior we can imagine worlds of emotions.      George Steves handles all of this with great subtlety, which is part of the charm of the film.  We see the attraction of the pretty wife to Shane and we see that he likes her too, but we aren't hit over the head with this. (At first I thought she might have known him before and was waiting for some revelation of a past romance.)  Shane obviously notices her beauty and goodness and yet he stands by, silently, as he knows that he will never be able to touch her.  He loves the child, too, and the whole community scene, but, as he says in the end, he can't change who he is. The joys of domestic life aren't for the gun slinger, even a reformed one.  So, the whole heartbreaking romance of un-fulfilled love in its many forms is what gets you.  In the end, too, we don't know what happens to him.  Is he mortally wounded?  A flesh wound?  Where will he go?  Again, it's the unknown that's part of the appeal of the film.    At first I thought Alan Ladd didn't look right for the part...maybe because the only other roles I'd seen him in were sort of city slicker or playboy types.  He is small and with that blond hair and those pretty features, he certainly doesn't seem the type to \\"whoop\\" a whole tavern full of roughnecks.  But it works...it's part of the improbable that makes the movie stick in your mind.    The setting of the Grand Tetons could not be more magnificent.  Several people here who have read the book complained that the film didn't match the book; few do...but here we get what the book can't provide..the amazing shots of this gorgeous area.      I though Van Heflin was awfully good.  His rough hewn sincerity was the perfect compliment to Ladd's smooth quietness.  Brandon de Wilde was just perfect.  I find child actors often really annoying but this performance was wonderful.  Seeing the story through his eyes is another factor in the magic of the film.  This is how kids look at things..larger than life heros.    I don't really get the appeal of Jean Arthur but she was ok here.  Jack Palance gave a striking performance as the really really bad guy!  It was fun to pick out Ellen Corby who later played Grandma in The Waltons and I think Nancy Kulp who later starred in some tv series was among the villagers, too.  The dog was great and the deer was fantastic!    Alltogether a memorable movie, well worth watching over and over.

B000FQ4M58|4.0|First off Nikki Sixx helped write this album...anything Nikki touches turns to Gold. Motley Crue wouldn't be were they are if it wasn't for Nikki. For all of you morons out there...Tommy Lee isn't what makes Motley Crue. Nikki Sixx and Mick Mars do all the writting. i haven't heard this album but I bet it's great due to Meatloaf's GREAT voice and Nikki's writting.
B0000C7PRY|5.0|Just in case you are not familiar with him, Neal Morse is the former leader of Spock's Beard, one the more successful progressive rock bands to emerge in the late 90's.  Morse decided to leave the band and pursue a solo career of Christian progressive rock with this release.  This is not his first solo album, but it is the first of his Christian era.  I am not really an expert on Christian rock, but I have to say, of the albums I have heard, this one may be the best ever.  The album basically tells Neal's story about his history (both before and during Spock's Beard) and his eventual conversion to Christianity.  The album does get quite preachy in spots, which may turn off non-believers, but I personally think that this is an album that just about anyone can enjoy regardless of religious convictions.  Morse is a master story teller, songwriter and musician, and all of his strengths are played out over the course of these two discs.  The album is a bit on the long side, and probably could have been pared down a bit, but there is not a lot of filler to be found here either.  Morse's music is all over the place with classic progressive rock being the main anchor, but he delves into a little bit of everything along the way.  I especially enjoy the tracks that tell his autobiographical journey of trying to make it in the Los Angeles music scene of the 80's and 90's.  His search for meaning in life is again a universal theme that I think people of all (or no) faith can relate.  Pretty much everything Morse touches turns to gold, but I think this may be his best solo work.  Just outstanding all the way around.
0920668372|1.0|I was given this book and only recently got around to reading it to my children (we have lots of books to get through!).  It starts out cute, and very quickly declines in to \\"strange behaviour\\". I'm a mother of 4 children whom I love dearly, and I do NOT want them to think that I'll be sneaking in to their homes later in life whilst they sleep. How creepy is that.  And I really hope my son does not grow as a man who sleeps with his teddy and sucks his thumb.  I'm shocked this book was published. Hollywood could make a really creepy movie out of this one.

B000VPUIA6|5.0|If you like the extra stuff, it is worth the money. You can buy just the movie for $20.00. This deluxe one is $95.00. And what would a large color book cost at borders? $30.00. And 6 lobby cards? Probably will sell for 6.99 each which is another 42.00. Then the poster would cost at least $10.00. So if you bought everything separetley it would cost at least $100.00. So if you want the goddies, it's worth it. And if you don't there is the 20.00 version.
0385340559|5.0|First of all, presuming of course that you are reading this Mr. Child, let me start by saying that I loved this book more than any other Reacher novel yet, which is saying a lot.  Something about the build up, the foot work, the set up for the final few chapters---it really and truly worked.  But want to know why I really liked it?<br /><br />Because FINALLY, the punishment fit the crime.<br /><br />And this is a lament I've had with a few of your other novels (most notably Die Trying and The Hard Way).  When the bad guy finally goes down, it's not nearly satisfying enough.  The villains you create are so truly despicable, so awful and vile, that the reader WANTS to see them pay.  We WANT repercussion to be SIGNIFICANT.  Yet too many times the punishment passes by in the blink of an eye, when it should be the crowning point of the book instead.  It's something we want to SAVOR!<br /><br />And that's why this book is different.  The ending was stupendous!  All that pent up anger and frustration I felt was appropriately relieved.  Please keep this up.  I've almost put your books away for good, several times, after being let down by your endings (especially after such FABULOUS beginnings and middles!).

B000FOQ0TG|4.0|I already own the original release (1988) of Operation: Mindcrime. And I own the Limited Edition box set of Operation: LIVEcrime (1989) which included the CD and the concert on VHS. However, I'm planning to get this set anyway because of the newly remastered version of the album, and a different concert which I've never heard before. Not to mention the special books that will come with it (I'm guessing). The primary reason I'm getting it though is for the Video: Mindcrime DVD (which I do not own on VHS).
B00009P1MP|5.0|Poetic. Thoughtful. Intelligent. These are words that describe the music on Don McLean's American Pie (1971).<br /><br />The title song has become so much a part of the American culture, it's almost a second national anthem of sorts. Who doesn't know American Pie? Written as a combination tribute to Buddy Holly/The American Dream, it transcended generations and social classes and, in it's own way, brought them together at a time when they were worlds apart. The enigmatic lyrics can be interpreted many different ways, so the song still remains fresh and relevent after many years and many listens.<br /><br />Vincent is a loving tribute to the great Dutch painter Vincent Van Gogh, and is one of the most thoughtful, lovely, and intelligent songs I have ever heard. It's completely worthy of it's subject, and describes Van Gogh's paintings (Starry Night, Sunflowers), his beautiful and tormented soul, and his suicide, in a thoughtful and passionate way. Vincent would have been very proud.<br /><br />Empty Chairs and The Grave are also very good, and both are emotional and personal looks at life and death.<br /><br />Don McLean is a poet who plays an acoustic guitar very well. His open-tunings and fingerstyle expressions are sometimes reminiscent of David Crosby's acoustic guitar style. Almost every song is the song of a poet, and McLean's vision is the vision of a poet. He looks at the world in such a way that sees beauty in all things, even sadness and suffering. But his message is not pessimistic or foreboding, it is trusting and hopeful. In Winterwood, he sings:<br /><br />The birds like leaves on Winterwood,<br />Sing hopeful songs on dismal days.<br />They've learned to live life as they should,<br />They are at peace with nature's ways.<br /><br />American Pie is an American classic, and it's as much a part of the American experience as the Americana the title song makes reference to. Buddy Holly, Richie Valens, The Big Bopper, James Dean, Chevy, pick-up trucks, dancing in the gym, rock n' roll, faith in God's love, satan laughing with delight, drinking whiskey and rye, teenagers on prom night, and the day the music died.laughing with delight, drinking whiskey and rye, teenagers on prom night, and the day the music died.
B0002EXH40|5.0|I can't say this is the best album Megadeth ever released, but I can say that over the years, I've listened to this more than any other. So what does that say?    Whatever Dave and Co. were trying to achieve in the 90's, they nailed it on \\"Youthanasia.\\" It's a lesson in structuring the perfect song order. One just flows after the other seamlessly, and it's a good argument against downloading one or two songs and leaving the rest behind. You can really miss the artist's vision and cheat yourself of a fantastic listening experience.    Speaking of downloading, do yourself a favor and get the CD. They are sonically superior to mp3s/WMAs/AACs, and you can always rip them in 320kbps. This is one of the Megadeth re-masters that is worth the upgrade. The bass is really punched up, the drums are bigger, and the guitars are more jagged-sounding, especially on \\"Train of Consequences.\\" It sounds awesome.    The bonus songs are among the best in the re-mastered catalog too, especially \\"New World Order.\\"
B00005JKG9|1.0|Great cast right?  That's why I bought it.    Let me tell you, I've never seen a movie with so much yelling in my entire life.  Now I can handle the f-bomb in most movies but this one went over the top, especially when it's being screamed at you for an hour and a half.  This one ended up on my shortlist of films my wife and I simply couldn't sit through.  Why people are loving it is beyond me.
B000TUXL2A|5.0|Mark Knopfler is stellar and this is his greatest work.  Hard to believe someone can continue to grow, expand their horizons, and produce such first rate material decade after decade.    I've enjoyed Dire Straits since the mid/late-70's, and was lucky enough to see them perform in San Antonio in 1984.  I've enjoyed Knopfler especially, and received notice of this album via \\"My Space.\\"  I don't normally buy too many CD's anymore, especially new music.  My purchases tend to be \\"upgrading\\" my old vinyl records and cassettes to CD's.      This CD was more than worth the purchase price.  Often, I just skip to one or two songs I like.  This piece of work flows and other than Dark Side of the Moon, I can't think of anything I've enjoyed more, first run through.  It just flows right, all the way through.  His individual songs are awesome, but the complete CD is superlative.    I used to play Dire Straits \\"Brothers in Arms\\" to death.  It's only my opinion, but Knopfler, in my view, topped that work with this set.  His guitar is always amazing, and I love this man's voice.  But there is something about \\"Kill to get Crimson\\" that distinguishes it from anything else.  You can introduce this CD to any crowd. It's music that appeals at many levels.  Music to have playing at a party, play it while you're working, but most especially, savor Mark Knopfler on your own.  Every song tells a story, and this song-writer is aged to perfection!
B00000JFV9|5.0|GRITTY!POWERFUL!IN YOUR FACE!,BUT THE MESSAGE THEN IS STILL, THE SAME TODAY! IN THE HOOD.THIS GENT WAS PREACHING GHETTO GOSPEL,LONG BEFORE IT WAS COOL,THE SONG \\"EDDIE YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER!\\" IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES FROM THIS HISTORICAL CLASSIC,CURTIS UNDERSTOOD HOW IT WAS TO  LOOK OUT FROM WITHIN,THAT IS WHY THIS WILL CONTINUE TO PLAYED FOR GENERATIONS TO COME.........TIMELESS
B000NDIAWY|5.0|Brandi Carlile is an amazing artists! I reccomend this CD and if you get the chance go see her in concert, she is absolutely amazing live! I honestly wasn't that big a fan of hers until I saw her in concert and since then I haven't been able to listen to anything else. The emotion is there in her voice, she is friendly and personable, and her and the 'twins' play so well together you can tell they are having a great time. I can't wait until she comes back this way again.
B00000K31Q|5.0|1) Epic cast.  2) It's based on/a modern-day version of a Shakespearean play 'The Taming of the Shrew'.  3) The music is quite lovely.  4) Some parts/scenes are to die for.  5) The plot is superb.  6) I love how everything works out in the end for mostly everyone.  7) I like how their clothes/fashion reminds us about what fashion was like in the late 1990's; it's like a historical documentary of the fashion sense.  8) I like how each character has, well, CHARACTER. Not everyone's the same type of person and each person is very individualistic in their own way, unlike many other movies.  9) It's witty and hilarious & not too girly and not too manly so it's right for everyone.  10) It's BEYOND awesome!!!!!        BUY IT.  I highly recommend this film/movie. It is simply adorable & you will never ever get sick of it, never. :)
B000V8I2QU|5.0|I have to say after reading some reviews I was like....mmmm maybe not. But I got it and listened. Love it. Granted I think the sound is a little muffled but nothing dramatic. I'm a fan from the late 70s and it took me back to the Bruce/Southside days. Had a serious Little Steven production sound to it minus La Bamba and the horns. As far as being political...that's THE MOST RIDICULOUS non-sense I read in the reviews. Sure he states an opinion on the war in one sentence (god forbid!) and that what makes Rock ----Rock and not Pop. Rock is rebellion against all the nicey nice goopy sentiments. So yes this CD rocks.     I especially like Girls in Their Summer Clothes - very cool song. And Livin' in the Future really brought me back the days of small concert halls, and fun Jersey shore songs. [This is very Jukes/Little Steven sounding]    If you're looking for Born to Run 2 or The River - The Sequel, you'll be disappointed. It's new yet old Bruce. The lyrics are more observational and mature (hey he's not 24 anymore) and less introspective and searching. I'd much rather listen to this CD than the godawful stuff pretending to be rock music now.     So I say buy it and enjoy it. It's fun. Best of all it's new Bruce stuff!
B00005O5CM|2.0|This DVD version of \\"Legally Blonde\\" is corrupt. They SAY it includes many many special features on the box, but when you open it and pop it into your DVD player, it does NOT have these special features:  1) Deleted Scenes  2) 2 Featurettes: \\"Inside Legally Blonde\\" & \\"The Hair That Ate Hollywood\\"  3) Hit Music Video \\"Perfect Day\\" By Hoku  4) Original Theatrical Trailer    What it DOES include, though, is this:  1) 2 Audio Commentaries Featuring Robert Luketic, Reese Witherspoon, Marc Platt & Film Crew  2) a Trivia Track        If you want \\"the whole enchilada\\", I strongly suggest you don't buy this DVD. It's a waste of money and a big fake.      On the upside, though, \\"Legally Blonde\\" is 'a feel-good girl-power [movie]'. It's one of my favorites and it should be your's too! Some parts are hilarious and the plot is great too. If you just want to buy this DVD/movie just for the sake of enjoying the movie, then I'd say \\"GO FOR IT!!!!!\\" :)
B000ULQV0W|4.0|I've heard other Eddie Vedder tunes on a surf movie soundtrack, and it seemed to go well on its own but made a whole lot more sense with the images being shown in the film (as to the end of it).    This is a very good album, or soundtrack. However, I cant really say much about it because I've not seen the movie. However, its nice to see Vedder break out of his Pearl Jam relm and experiment by himself.     I doubt any of us will see a solo album come from him, and this will be as close as it gets, so if you enjoy a good mellow, at times tense, feel good, folkish rock album (if its ok to possibly describe it as that).     I just cant help but feel that i wish this album was released back when I was backpacking after university, a good travel/on the road album.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|After the great, cinematic road trips (\\"The Wild, the Innocent,\\" \\"Born to Run,\\" \\"Darkness,\\" \\"The River\\"); the rock-star coming-of-age musings (\\"Born in the U.S.A.,\\" \\"Tunnel of Love\\"); the folk-tinged roots explorations (\\"Nebraska,\\" \\"Tom Joad,\\" \\"Seeger Sessions\\"); the \\"um, that was ... interesting\\" side trips (I'm lookin' at you, \\"Lucky Town\\" and \\"Human Touch\\"); and the sober takes on the New Millennium (\\"The Rising,\\" \\"Devils + Dust\\"), \\"Magic\\" is a logical progression for Springsteen. An amalgam of all the great riffs, sing-along choruses, and signature Boss features (glockenspiel, anyone?), the latest from Bruce also benefits from the emotional intensity and darkness his lyrics have explored in recent years. And of course, his E Street Band compatriots are here in full sonic force -- the engine that drives Springsteen's train of thought.<br /><br />In case anyone missed it, this is a deeply political album. I'm dumbfounded by reviews that say it includes \\"one or two songs about the war in Iraq.\\" EVERY song is in some way about the war in Iraq, or about the state of America today. I'm also amused by the predictable hue and cry that denouncing these things is somehow unpatriotic. (Seriously, does anyone even pay attention to that rot anymore?) Springsteen's love of country comes through loud and clear, along with his disgust about the way that country has been shamed by the people currently running it. \\"Magic\\" may, in fact, be the most patriotic album of his career.<br /><br />All of the songs are strong in their own way, with a bevy of standouts: \\"Livin' in the Future,\\" with its wildly jubilant hook standing in contrast to the disillusioned verses; \\"Gypsy Biker,\\" brimming with fury and a palpable sense of loss; \\"Girls in Their Summer Clothes,\\" in which Bruce channels Brian Wilson (and sings more beautifully than I ever knew he could); \\"Magic,\\" with its chilling portrait of a mephistophelean figure that might represent Dick Cheney, the media, or 90% of Congress; \\"Last to Die,\\" asking a devastating question that may never be answered; and \\"Long Walk Home,\\" the latest in a long line of musings on a \\"hometown\\" that's become a barren, soulless place. In the last of these, the lyric \\"You know, that flag flying over the courthouse/Means certain things are set in stone/Who we are, what we'll do and what we won't/It's gonna be a long walk home\\" is, in the best Springsteen tradition, both gloomy and hopeful -- a recognition that America has lost its footing, but coupled with the conviction that it can still be set aright.<br /><br />My only complaint about the album is Brendan O'Brien's production, which is every bit as muddy-sounding here as it was on \\"The Rising.\\" Brendan, please back away from the compressor. I'm begging you.<br /><br />But in every other way, this is as satisfying a Bruce Springsteen album as any he's put out -- and a perfect, pointed commentary about a nation in dire need of a little magic of its own.a devastating question that may never be answered; and \\"Long Walk Home,\\" the latest in a long line of musings on a \\"hometown\\" that's become a barren, soulless place.

B000BT97AO|3.0|Mirrormask is a film released by the late Jim Hensen's production company.  It is directed by Dave McKean and written by Neil Gaiman.  The two initially came up with the concept together and both aspire to bring the story further in manga and comic books.  I can see why the Hensen company wanted to take on this project after watching the long term success of their projects from the 80s (i.e. Labyrinth and The Dark Crystal).  Although I'm not sure Mirrormask got the exposure those films did and it won't likely gain the same level of long-term nostalgic success that those films did either.  In fact, I'd challenge whether or not this story could possibly be appealing to any broad demographic at all.  It seems directed at children but at the same time I think sometimes it may be too smart for its own good.  I can see this going over quite a few kids' heads and it's not quite exciting enough to hold their interest visually.  Still, there's some undeniable passion behind this story and I have to credit Gaiman and McKean for soldiering forth and ensuring that their project was finished. They clearly loved the story and it shows. It's a unique picture and at times it's very good, albeit perhaps not always interesting enough to prod the audience along for the ride.<br /><br />Mirrormask follows a young girl named Helena (Stephanie Leonidas) who works with her family in the circus and longs to \\"join the real world\\".  Her mother (Gina McKee) and Helena have a fight and then her mother collapses and needs an operation.  Helena feels sorry for things she said to her mother and she begins to dream of another world full of metaphors for her real life and her struggles with her darkest traits.  This is when McKean's style takes over and the art direction of Mirrormask becomes commendable.  The soundtrack is also noteworthy and melts in with the film's visuals quite nicely.<br /><br />The story is rich with far more details then I have indicated and the film is worthy of multiple viewings if you find it interesting but confusing the first time around.  This sort of requirement is the reason I think Mirrormask is for a select audience.  It is not The Dark Crystal or Labyrinth but it is somewhere in between those films and maybe Legend or The Company of Wolves.  I could even see some comparisons to Something Wicked this Way Comes or possibly the more recent film Pan's Labyrinth.  It is in the frame of a storybook fantasy but yet its complexity seems more appropriate for an adult and even though the overtones are for children and the undertones a bit more complicated, it is almost a shame that the overtones are also not exciting enough to hook a child in.  Basically, that keeps Mirrormask aimed predominantly toward the imaginative adult demographic.  Perhaps the same folks that still hold some regard for comic books.  I'm certainly not saying that's a bad thing.  Mirrormask is a very unique experience with great imaginations putting it together on their own terms.ou find it interesting but confusing the first time around.

B000WC3A0S|2.0|The stars which are used to rate this product are for the technical specs of the product itself, not a rating on the merits of the films.  I am a huge Rocky fan, so the films would get five stars, no matter how they were packaged.  Ok, now that I've cleared that up:    From The Digital Bits news today: \\"In other release news, MGM has just set a Rocky: The Complete Saga DVD box set for release on 12/4 (SRP $59.98). The set will include Rocky, Rocky II, Rocky III, Rocky IV, Rocky V and yes... the recent Rocky Balboa. Unfortunately, according to the studio's press release, the only extras on the set are a pair of trailers (one for Rocky and one for Rocky V). Yo, Adrian! Where's the beef?\\"  If that is true--and it probably is since The Digital Bits is the most reliable site for DVD news--why bother releasing this set?      Here's the DVD history of Rocky:  MGM originally released individual standard DVDs of the Rocky movies many years ago as the DVD format became more popular.  The DVDs were, to put it charitably, poorly produced.  Subsequently, MGM released a Rocky I-V box set back in 2001 to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of Rocky.  Although the packaging was nice, there wasn't much improvement to the DVDs themselves as far as audio and video transfers; the most significant detail of the set was the addition of interviews and other special features to the first Rocky disc.  A few years later, the set was re-released with different packaging, with some improved audio and video transfers on some of the movies (Rocky V was notably left untouched).  And last year, to coincide with the release of Rocky Balboa, the set was re-released again, this time with the cheap, thin DVD cases now being used in tv season DVD packages as the only difference from the previous release.  Inexplicably, rather than being included in the re-re-released box set, the first Rocky movie was also separately re-released on DVD in a 2 disc 30th Anniversary special edition (Well, I guess greed would explain it...).  So, if you bought any of the box sets, you still had to purchase the 30th Anniversary edition of Rocky to be a true completist.       With Rocky Balboa having been available on DVD for over six months, MGM has now chosen to release the complete set of films in a new box set.  But what a missed opportunity this represents to include special features which have been omitted from previous releases.  I do not know if there are cut scenes from Rocky IV in the MGM vaults, but I know for a fact that there is massive material for Rocky V, as a bootleg \\"uncut\\" version of the film has been circulating online for years.  Also, why not finally upgrade the video transfer of Rocky V?  Perhaps the most egregious omission will be special features for Rocky Balboa.  Listening to Stallone's commentary on the DVD, he repeatedly refers to a \\"director's cut\\" which he would like to release at some point.  This would have been the perfect time.
B000V8I2QU|2.0|Medicore at best--way overproduced but still not with a strong voice or vocals--many lyrics are unintelligible--way too much noise, not music.  I've seen him 3 times, twice with THE Band(1976-77).  Nothing seems to be fun anymore just a bleak grind.  Any of his first 5 albums are better than this dark cloud--another reviewer was right, these songs sound like bad leftovers from The Rising.  Anyone who thinks this is something more than an average album is listening with memory and faith and not with a musical ear.
0151013047|3.0|The main character in this book supposedly represents the Muslim perspective and grievances against the West, especially after September 11th.  However, his behavior is so repugnant that I actually don't care about his fate one bit.<br /><br />Yes, every immigrant to another country feels alienated and misunderstood sometimes, nothing so special about it. He got an elite education and a job, American girlfriend introduced him to her family and friends, yet this man could not feel any sadness for the horrible deaths of innocent civilians on September 11th.  His selfishness and lack of concern for the feelings of others are horrendous. He viewed  America the same way viewed the young woman, Erica, who was supposedly his romatic interest, as objects to satisfy his longing for validation of his \\"specialness\\".<br /><br />Changez fantasizes about a relationship with Erica, even though she clearly told him that she was still grieving over her lost boyfriend and was not yet ready for a new romantic relationship, what she needed was a friend.  Yet, unable to accept rejection, Changez forced himself on Erica with disastrous emotional consequences for her. The guy has no respect or consideration for other people's grief and pain. All he does is feeling sorry for himself, despite being given wonderful opportunities for education and carreer, opportunities that, in fact, only a few Americans get.<br /><br />He decided to use his Princeton education to get a high paying, high power job.  When he becomes disappointed with it, remarkably, he concludes that it is America that is at fault, that America is power hungry, as if he did not have other choices.  I am sure that quite a few of Princeton graduates become human rights lawers, doctors, educators, join Peace Corps or pick a multitude of other wonderful life choices.  The Changez's choice to regress into fundamentalism is more a testament to his own pathology then it is America's fault.  Yes, there was more racism against Muslims in America after September 11th, but there were also the biggest anti-war demonstrations in New York and Washington, and multiple political movements for peace and justice, which he does not bother to acknowledge.<br /><br /> I do not agree with American foreign policy after September 11th, but I also have no sympathy for Changez, this selfish entitled prick.eptember 11th, but there were also the biggest anti-war demonstrations in New York and Washington, and multiple political movements for peace and justice, which he does not bother to acknowledge.

The first recipe I made from the book was the chocolate chip cookies, which I feel actually tasted better than the ones with dairy I was brought up with. This is an amazing cookbook and a great leap for vegans everywhere. Baking no longer has to be an odd tasting replica of what we used to enjoy before, but a healthier, more delicious and cruelty free dessert. :)
0316067598|5.0|This is a great history book about a very important event during our time.  I remember hearing about it on the news like it was yesterday. It points out how the battles are fought in Afghanistan and the dangers that our elite military face every day.  These brave men must never be forgotten.  Thank you Marcus!     The most depressing moment in the book is how our liberal democrats and the main stream media have poisoned the thoughts of our most highly trained soldiers while exposed to extreme danger.  Any young man or women who is currently or thinking of serving in our military need to read this book.  I hope this book will change the thinking of anyone in combat about making choices and not letting the media and our liberals distort their thinking while in harms way.  Anyone that wants to dispute this obviously does not understand the harm they have caused our military and even us during a time of war.     Thank you Marcus Luttrell, Matthew Axelson (Axe), Lt.

B000V8I2QU|5.0|For those Springsteen fans who were somewhat less excited about the acoustic(Tom Joad, Devils&Dust) and revivalist(Seeger Sessions)work by Bruce in recent years, Magic marks the sometimes return of the full E-Street band sound of earlier years. The lead single Radio Nowhere roars out with authority. The title track is appropriately creepy.Girls in Their Summer Clothes evokes the Beach Boys. It has some of the memorable-chorus quality of Born in the USA with some of the recent-work sophistication. If you were trepidatious about Bruce after recent albums, the classic Bruce is largely(or enough)back on this one. Undoubtedly one of the finest albums of 2007.
0553584537|4.0|Lisa Gardner's \\"Alone\\" reads like a television miniseries and if you are after suspense, action and some psychological twists, this is a fine novel for sheer enjoyment.<br /><br />Bobby is a SWAT team member with the Massachusetts State Police. He's called into a hostage situation and from the moment he pulls the trigger, nothing is as it seems to be in what began as a \\"standard\\" domestic hostage situation. From the relationship of Bobby to the hostage to his own psychological problems, author Gardner develops a thread of surprising twists and increasing suspense until the culmination of a scene of incredible suspense. I don't want to provide any spoilers here and I suggest if you like this kind of fiction, you avoid reading ahead as it really affects the entertainment value.<br /><br />If you like television drama, this is a book that moves fast and has plenty of action. The characters are those you'd find in any film--in fact, this reads rather like a screenplay. So for most casual readers, this is a very pleasing suspense novel. Compared to some others I've read by Gardner, I'd have to say, \\"Alone\\" is by far the best and deserves to be filmed. It's not great literature--this is pure reading entertainment. Great for the beach, a plane ride or being stuck at the doctor's office.

B000OVLBEO|1.0|Just a bad movie overall. This film only proves that no matter how many cool effects and tricks you use, it can't possible make up for a shoddy script and horrid acting. [[ASIN:B000N2HD6Y Creepshow III]] made more sense than this predictible film. Certainly not Cage's best acting either. But really cool computer effects! Goes to show where all the money went with this film. And the chick was pretty hot too!<br /><br />Just a predictable script with cheesy acting by some barnyard rejects. Too bad Sam Elliot and Peter Fonda (what the hell was he doing here?) didn't have anything better to do than this film. Cage is good, and so is the hot chick. But that's it.<br /><br />A rent if you must but definitely not a buy!
1400032717|3.0|I have never had autism affect my life personally, so I'm not going to act like I know ANYTHING about it, but Mr. Haddon has personally worked with those with autism, so I found this book incredibly insightful for those of us on the outside looking in.  It was interesting to see the thought-processes of Christopher Boone because he thinks so differently than those of us who do not have autism (I will say that just because I read a book that looks inside the mind of an autistic doesn't mean that I will lump all those with autism to having the same thought-processes as Christopher Boone, however).  I just found it interesting to take a walk through his mind, and not just in a scientific way (like the discovery health programs look at those with autism), but to see how he deals with social aspects he should not be able deal with, such as complex emotion (empathy) or dramatic scenarios (abandonment, betrayal).  Because you get to see how his mind works on both ends of the spectrum, I found it very insightful.  Since the story is told through Christopher, it is told in a flat and basic kind of prose (and I hate to say it, and though it may reflect true to his way of thinking, I found that the way he told the story grated on my nerves).  The novel gave me a great understanding of how difficult it can be to be an autistic mind in an unsympathetic society, and how difficult it can be to be an untrained parent trying to understand and relate to a child with autism.
B000UR9TQE|1.0|Since this set isn't coming out for another month (it's now October 16), why are people commenting on it? I can understand thinking or hoping for certain things to come out. But that's what forum's are for, right? How can you comment on something you don't own yet? It's like saying how the weather for the next month just sucks...or your next car doesn't ride as good as your current one does. Again, if you've got questions or concerns, post to the forum; that's what it's there for. Leave reviews to real reviews of the product and not crying about how you hope the quality is better than the other versions.<br /><br />Just a thought...

B000UCEJEQ|5.0|Elegant and heartfelt....no one, male or female has ever done an album more artistically than British songbird, Annie Lennox.  With some songs sounding a bit familiar with shades of the \\"Diva\\" CD's \\"Cold\\" and the \\"Medussa\\" CD's \\"Something So Right,\\" \\"Songs of Mass Destruction\\" is Annie Lennox's strongest and best arranged CD to date!  From the very first track, \\"Dark Road,\\" the listener is swept into one \\"story\\" after another, as each song foretells of desires, longings, and heartaches.<br /><br />\\"Dark Road\\" begins the cd and brings to mind the sheer beauty of \\"No More I Love You's\\" from the \\"Diva\\" cd, and is then followed by a great rythmned \\"Love Is Blind,\\" which I hope makes a fantastic DJ \\"mix\\" project. \\"Smithereens\\" is another incredibly beautiful mix of love ballad meets pop song- beautifully done.  \\"Ghosts in the Machine\\" brings an inspired Gospel beat to the collection and is followed by \\"Womankind,\\" which is a creative mix of Annie's vocals in various formations making it a fun listen! \\"Through The Glass Darkly\\" is another lovely ballad, however, Annie's continuous \\"Yeah-ah-ah, Yeah,ah,ah, Yeah,ah,ah\\" is almost overwrought making her voice sound more strained than melodious.<br /><br />The soul searching on \\"Lost\\" is heartfelt and you can even imagine a flock of birds crying out \\"We're lost! We're lost! We're lost!\\" as the song drifts along and becomes quiet haunting.  \\"Coloured Bedspread\\" will remind Eurythmics fans of Annie and Dave Stewart's \\"European synthesizer\\" days as it brings the most dynamic range of synthesizers and lush vocal sounds giving a more \\"Eurythmics\\" sound than anything the duo has released since, \\"Sweet Dreams,\\" \\"Love Is A Stranger,\\" or even \\"Here Comes The Rain Again.\\"<br /><br /> An announcement proceeds the next track, \\"Sing\\" informing the listener of an African women's drug abuse prevention charity and is an encouraging track with lots of great vocals. A stirring and VERY beautifully vocal \\"Big Sky\\" sweeps your imagination with an array of thoughts, both sad and hopeful. \\"Fingernail Moon\\" brings the CD to it's grand finale and is a lovely close to an incredible collection of songs that are beautifully woven together by Annie's \\"storyteller\\" voice that beckons the listener to return again and again for another journey into a beautiful world of \\"Dark Roads,\\" \\"Coloured Bedspreads,\\" \\"Big Skies,\\" and \\"Fingernail Moons...\\" Bravo!  If this album doesn't sweep the Grammy's, then true musical taste and artistic talent is forever in serious trouble and probably dead.

B0000E1ALR|4.0|THE BAND: Bruce Springsteen (vocals, guitars, harmonica, bass, recorder, mandolin)... and a host of musicians over the decades - the main players being - Roy Bittan (piano, keyboards, synth, mellotron, backing vocals), Stevie Van Zandt (guitars, mandolin, backing vocals), Patti Scialfa (guitar, backing vocals), Clarence Clemons (saxophone, percussion, backing vocals), Danny Federici (accordion, organ, piano), Garry Tallent (bass, tuba, backing vocals), Nils Lofgren (guitar), Max Weinberg (drums & percussion, backing vocals).<br /><br />THE DISC: (2003) 42 tracks on 3 discs clocking in at approximately 200 minutes (disc-1 at 76 minutes, disc-2 at 77 minutes, disc-3 at 47 minutes). Included with the discs is a 42-page booklet containing song titles/credits, song lyrics, year each song was released (but sadly does not include what songs came from which albums), musicians on each track, numerous band photos, and thank you's. This compilation covers Springsteen's career from 1973-2002. Remastered sound. Label - Columbia / Sony Music.<br /><br />ALBUM REPRESENTATION: Greetings From Asbury Park (3 songs), The Wild, The Innocent & The E-Street Shuffle (2), Born To Run (3), Darkness On The Edge Of Town (3), The River (2), Nebraska (2), Born In The USA (3), Tunnel Of Love (2), Human Touch (1), Lucky Town (2), The Ghost Of Tom Joad (1), The Rising (3), \\"Philadelphia\\" movie soundtrack (1), Live in NYC (2). Disc-3 contains odds & sods, B-sides, live tracks, rarities, etc.<br /><br />COMMENTS: You get a lot of Bruce here. It's a great collection of songs (and a ton of music for the price). It makes his \\"Greatest Hits\\" (1995) look downright small... though don't trade in your \\"Greatest Hits\\" disc - it's worth keeping since 6 songs won't be found on this \\"Essential\\" set. THE GOOD: Many of Bruce's staples are here - \\"Blinded By The Light\\", \\"For You\\", \\"Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)\\", \\"Thunder Road\\", \\"Born To Run\\", \\"Jungleland\\", \\"Badlands\\", \\"Hungry Heart\\", \\"Nebraska\\", \\"Born In The USA\\", \\"Glory Days\\", \\"Dancing In The Dark\\", \\"Brilliant Disguise\\", \\"Human Touch\\", \\"Lonesome Day\\", etc. The booklet is extensive - lyrics & photos are a definite plus (also included is a 1-page note from Bruce noting the long career he's had and the difficult task in selecting songs for a compilation). The songs are in chronological order (another plus in my book), so you can hear Bruce mature/change over the years. Glad to see \\"American Skin (41 Shots)\\" made it from \\"Live in NYC\\"... this is/was my favorite live song in recent years... and if you've seen the band perform it live or on their HBO special from 2001, (knowing the story) maybe you'll feel the same. Disc-3 is a treat - lots of unreleased material (my favorites being \\"County Fair\\" and the live \\"Trapped\\". THE NOT SO GOOD: There's no such thing as THE perfect 'best of' mix. This holds true of this \\"Essential\\" collection from Springsteen. The liner notes say the sound is \\"remastered\\" (no mention of digitally remastered), yet the first half of disc-1 still sounds a bit dated. I have to keep reminding myself that the early-to-mid 70's recording technology was not kind to some artists. As much as you get here, there are still some very key songs missing - \\"10th Avenue Freeze-out\\", \\"Growing Up\\", \\"Backstreets\\", \\"I'm On Fire\\", \\"Pink Cadillac\\", \\"I'm Going Down\\", \\"My Hometown\\", \\"Cover Me\\", \\"Prove It All Night\\", \\"Adam Raised A Cain\\", \\"The Ties That Bind\\", \\"She's The One\\", \\"Reason To Believe\\", \\"Murder Inc\\", \\"Secret Garden\\", \\"Better Days\\"... and perhaps a few classics that were not big hits like \\"Does This Bus Stop at 82nd Street?\\", \\"Lost In The Flood\\", \\"Racing In The Streets\\", \\"Youngstown\\" or \\"Incident on 57th Street\\". Only 3 songs from the classic \\"Born To Run\\" is not enough, and 3 songs from \\"The Rising\\" is probably too much. And, couldn't they find a better photo for the cover? For me, listening to Bruce was always an album experience. If you just want to get your feet wet, this \\"Essential\\" disc should do the trick. If youreally want to dive in, gather up his 1st five albums plus \\"Born In The USA\\". A great collection of songs here, just not complete (4 stars).gather up his 1st five albums plus \\"Born In The USA\\". A great collection of songs here, just not complete (4 stars).
6305127638|2.0|This was a B-grade zombie attack movie set in the Star Trek universe.  Plenty of menacing looks and slow, inevitable walks towards assimilation by the Borg.  The characters were either unlikable or uninteresting, except for the Borg Queen.  The only parts of the story worth merit were the interactions between Data and the Borg Queen and maybe, just maybe between Picard and Lily.    And oh so many plot holes!!  All right, so you're the Borg, attacking Earth and taking over the only hostile spaceship in the area.  Oh, look, there are 3 armed crew coming our way while we try to place a deep space call for reinforcements.  That's okay, just ignore the humans.  Hmmm, one of our enemy is pressing a few buttons on a console nearby --- give him a menacing look and attack him.  Gosh, one of our own just got killed...no problem, just keep doing your work and ignore them.  Oh, but wait, another enemy is pressing a button, let's send 1 (and only 1) more Borg to attack that guy.  And so on.  The Borg have always been single-minded in purpose, but this movie reduced the Borg to mindless zombies.    Obviously the collective is aware of the threat posed by humans...or at least humans of their century...since they are going to great lengths to go back in time to assimilate Earth when humans are most vulnerable.  So if the collective is smart and can plan ahead, why is it ignoring any humans that walk by with lowered weapons?  Why does pressing buttons get them so excited but only 1 of them react?  According to this movie, Borg are highly strategically challenged and it is a wonder they assimilate any advanced race.  Would you send only 1 cube spaceship to attack your enemy's homeworld?  Borg already know the capabilities of the humans since they've attacked Earth before.  Obviously, they have the resources since they have assimilated thousands of worlds.  Why not send 10 or 100 Borg vessels?  (That would be a very exciting battle on the epic scale of Star Wars.)  If they wipe out Earth's defenses, they wouldn't have to go back to the past to assimilate humans when they are weakest.    And by the way, why did they decide to go back to the past at the moment humans developed warpdrive capabilities?  If they are interested in a strategic victory, they should attack Earth when humans are living in caves.  If they are interested in technology, they should assimilate Earth during modern times to gain the most knowledge.    The ending was anticlimactic, too.  What happens to the Borg now that their Queen is dead?  I guess this is just another \\"it never happened\\" kind of time travel movie, rather than advancing the Star Trek universe in any meaningful way.  The first contact by the Vulcans at the end was mildly interesting, but lacked the emotional appeal of say, Khan dying explosively or Spock returning to us reborn.    This movie just defies common sense and is boring to watch.  The plot was riddled with holes, the action was stale, and the ending anticlimactic.  I expect a zombie attack movie to be bad, but Star Trek movies should be much better than this.  This is nowhere near the number of stars people are giving it.
B000VPUIA6|5.0|Beatle23 wrote he would only pay the deluxe edition's price if it was \\"at least signed by one Beatle\\". A signed copy would put it's worth up in the $1,000 range. Would you pay that or moan its not worth it? C'mon people, the company has to make some profit here. Do you know how many people have to get their cut BEFORE The Beatles themselves get paid? Geez, you'd think it was $400. It's $95. I think that's pretty reasonable considering only 25,000 copies of this are being made, it has a deluxe hardcover slipcase, photo book, poster, lobby cards, script etc. What do you want it priced - at $30? Companies are in business to make money, not go poor because you're too cheap to pay a fair price.    I do have to agree with one comment - I do wish Paul and/or Ringo could have done commentary on this. It would have made it much more of a personal experience. We all know how we feel watching it, I just wonder what they would feel watching it themselves. When they don't bother to do commentary or have any direct connection to projects like this, it just looks like they let Apple & EMI grind out anything in their name as long as they get their royalty checks. The recent debacle with the EMI/Capitol CD reissues is a prime example. It's like they don't care. It seems the \\"Love\\" CD was the first and only project since \\"Anthology\\" that any of The Beatles oversaw the process before giving their final approval.    As for other video releases, we will NEVER see \\"Let It Be\\" I can guarantee that, but \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" will eventually get a remastered release I'm sure. The Beatles don't have a say in releasing \\"The Beatles at Shea Stadium\\" as SOFA Entertainment (who bought up the entire Ed Sullivan catalog) has the rights to the concert special.    People have been moaning about a \\"Help!\\" remastered DVD release for years (since the AHDN DVD), they finally get one and they still complain. I don't get it. At the rate that Apple/EMI puts out Beatles material (and correctly) be thankfulwe got this at all. No matter what the price.

1401300529|5.0|This gifted writer departs from what one expects for a study of a limited war. He paints the Korean conflict within a broader canvas of the times and the political issues that surrounded it. There are sufficient details of actual combat to provide the reader with an understanding of the confusion and failures as well as the successes of what occured. He furnishes data on the awful circumstances of the terrain and climate under which our men had to fight. Clay Blair's book as well as others give complete coverage of the fighting. Halberstam had another objective it seems to me. He made it clear why it occured and why America's leadership conducted the war as it did. By access to additional sources, he was also able to portray the war from the opponents viewpoint to help in understanding the events.     Among his original contributions are: the establishment through MacArthur's headquarters of the precedent of senior military people lying to their government and the American people that carried through to the Vietnam war as well as the planning of the current action in Iraq, a reasonable defense of Ridgeway's retaining of the odious Almond in a combat command position, the inability of both sides to find a way to stop the combat as soon as it was obvious a stalmate was developing, the lack of responsible leadership by many officers in command positions, the rigidity at that time of command structure.     He did a good job of reminding people of MacArthur's collapse in the congressional hearing when he faced men more powerful, with just as large egos, perhaps greater broad intelligence, a better grasp of the facts, and whom his flowing language would never impress.     LIke the other reviewers, I enjoyed the beautiful writing. If for no other reason, I recommend this volume as an interesting way to cast a study of military action. It would be an important addition to anyone's library.
B000VI6T6K|4.0|Yes, it sounds better than ever.  And there's no question that this is both a legendary performance and one of rock's most historic moments.  But this is now the third CD release of Monterey in 21 years and, even padded out with additional tuning and stage chatter, it runs only about 42 minutes.<br /><br />If you are a Hendrix fan, you'll buy it anyway; you should.  But there are no new revelations or insights to be found here.  And it's hard to overlook that Jimi's distant descendants, who now control his entire musical legacy, have found yet another way to wring additional profit from Hendrix's undeniable genius.
1400034779|5.0|What a superb book and series!  To categorize this book as a mystery or a detective novel is a misguided attempt at characterizing this novel far too narrowly. Sure, there are little stories within the book which are \\"mysteries\\" but these are merely the background, along with Botswana, on which the larger story is told. Indeed, those readers who read The No 1 Ladies Detective Agency series seeking a detective story may be disappointed, but they will at least have had the literary content of their typical reading raised.  This book also isn't \\"simple\\" as some have suggested either. The subleties of  human strength and human frailty , honesty and duplicity, love and selfishness, generosity and greed are worked out in the lives Mma Ramotswe and Mr. J L B Matekoni  and their clients and friends and offer a far more profoundly insightful glimpse of human relationships than any complex plot twisting thriller. The characters are beautifully drawn, warts and all, and they draw the reader into their world and make the reader feel that they too are there  with Mma Ramotswe, drinking red bush tea, and remembering to treat each other and everyone they meet with respect, kindness, grace, tact and dignity.

B000UCEJEQ|5.0|When I first heard that Annie Lennox was releasing a new album called \\"Songs of Mass Destruction,\\"I thought that perhaps she was going to go political, and sing songs about the horrible state of our world.  I then heard the single \\"Dark Road\\" and thought, \\"what exactly is Annie singing about here?\\"  I thought the message was a bit ambiguous, but after a few additional listens I realized that maybe I was supposed to feel a sense of ambiguity, because Annie was feeling this way herself.  I've come to really like this song, but I still get a little confused.<br /><br />The second song \\"Love Is Blind\\" shocked me a bit on my first listen.  She sings, \\"sometimes I feel like I don't exist, cut my veins and slit my wrists.  Goodbye. Goodbye.\\"  What?!  I have never in my life heard a singer speak of suicide, and certainly never expected to hear it from Annie Lennox.  I related to the song deeply though, in that I have attempted to end my life a few times, and the feelings expressed in this song are exactly the feelings that I felt during my emotionally traumatic events.<br /><br />The large portions of the album are songs of love lost, abandoned love, despair, and the reawakening of the emotional strength to recover - and the flipping of the finger.  The songs could come across as depressing, especially if you are not an evolved person, that has experienced the hurt and pain of an extreme breaking of the heart.  As a 54 year old man, I am able to realize that the emotions expressed on this album are universal, and Annie Lennox is not only speaking to us about her life, but also offering her experiences for our lives.<br /><br />I own all of Annie Lennox's solo albums, and many of the Eurythmics (did I spell this correctly?) albums, and \\"Songs of Mass Destruction\\" speaks to me in a very personal way, and is Annie's most beautiful musical creation yet.  I have been listening to it a lot since purchasing it, and I encourage all mature music lovers to buy this album, and listen to it with an open heart..

B000PY52EU|5.0|This is one of the better films I have seen recently, and I thought it was very original.<br /><br />Christina Ricci plays a very convincing part as the town tramp, basically. She sleeps with anyone and everyone, and is pretty much into the party scene, anyway, to make a long story short, One night one of her \\"dates\\" beats her up and throws her on the side of the road,<br />only to be found by Samuael Jackson.<br /><br />After a little investigating, he decides he is going to help this girl, and so he literally chains her up in his little shack/house until he feels she is past her evil ways.<br /><br />Of course she fights him on this , at first. But slowly and surely, a miracle happens and she begins to respect herself, and others.<br /><br />The story is very touching, and it is a love story, but a love story of friendship between these two unlikely characters.<br />It is also a story of redemption that I thought was very touching, and I highly reccomend this movie.
0525950079|4.0|Reading [[ASIN:0451225244 The Pillars of the Earth (Deluxe Edition) (Oprah's Book Club)]] was one of the happiest accidents in my reading career. I picked it up on a whim because of the cathedral on the cover and the word \\"epic\\" in a review. I had no idea it would turn out to be one of the best books I ever read, not on in terms of plot but completeness and the overall message of world change it puts out. So when I found out about the sequel I was thrilled. I ordered it two years in advance.    But I was disappointed. While \\"World without End\\" is compelling stuff with endless twists in it's storyline and characters you grow fond of, this book just doesn't have that epic pizzazz that \\"Pillars\\" had in spades. A lot of the events in this book seem to be rehashed from its predecessor and now that the cathedral is built it seems that the major issues facing Kingsbridge (like becoming a town in its own right, having a cathedral at all) are over and done with. \\"Pillars\\" was at its heart a book about creation and the forces of the time that caused that-the church, the ruling class, the merchants, even the peasents. Its a book about a developing society that is setteling down not only from the recent Norman invasion, but is gearing up to be one of the greatest empires the world will ever see (even though that happens hundreds of years later.) This book has no unifying theme that creates the epic feel that \\"Pillars\\" had-the sense that you were reading about something great (though fictional) in history.    Anyway the basic plot follows the formula from \\"Pillars.\\" We start out with a piece of a mystery that gradually revels clues to us as we read on. In this case, four children, two sons of an impoverished knight, (Ralph and Merthin) one wealthy daughter of a prosperous wool merchant (Caris) and a dirt poor urchin girl who steals so her family can live (Gwenda), witness a man attacked in the woods because of a letter he is carrying. This experience binds the children for life-along with that of the attacked knight (Thomas) who becomes a monk so he is beyond the reach of whoever tried to kill him.    Of course we don't know what's in the letter, just that it has something to do with the death of King Edward II (the gay one who was disposed by his Queen and her lover so her son could rule) and if it's found heads will (literally) role.     But this mystery is secondary, almost a non-presence in the book compared to the drama of Jack's father's death in \\"Pillars.\\" Also our main characters are like paler versions of the characters we loved and hated in \\"Pillars.\\" Merthin is Jack, the fantastic, romantic builder with an almost supernatural ability with stone, Ralph is William, the corrupt knight with no moral center, Caris is Aliena, strong and with more business sense and determination than any women of the time, and Gwenda-well she's an entirely new character but she features so little it doesn't even matter.    My point is this-there isn't a whole lot that's original in this book. The romance is nowhere near as spellbinding as the tortured and blinding love the perfect Jack and Aliena from \\"Pillars\\" had. In fact, its two hundred years later and now Kingsbridge is one of the largest cities in England instead of a struggling town, but everything seems the same.  The same conflicts happen again and again, the same character struggles. The only real difference is the emergence of the Black Death some lesbianism and a well described and probably realistic battle of the priory against the town (which frankly made me sad because Prior Phillip from \\"Pillars\\" would be so dissapointed at how the monastery developed.)    I'm not saying this is a bad book, its even compelling at times. But compared to \\"Pillars\\" it is a poor imitation of an almost perfect historical fiction novel. Who knows, maybe if you read this before Pillars (they aren't reliant on each other enough that order matters) it would seem like a better book then it is. But really, I expected more. I would put this on par with Follett's other two historical novels, [[ASIN:0449225151 A Place Called Freedom]] and [[ASIN:0440217490 A Dangerous Fortune]] but it's not in the same class as [[ASIN:0451225244 The Pillars of the Earth (Deluxe Edition) (Oprah's Book Club)]].     Of course not very many books are. Maybe one in a million.    So the real test, would I read this again. Sure. It was good after all-but it didn't live up to expectations created by \\"Pillars.\\"    Four stars.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I loved this movie.  Living in the 21st century, one appreciates period films such as this, when a woman's virtue was held in the highest esteem, and your word defined your character.  Men posed as if they portraits come to life. Women were like delicate flowers.<br /><br />Hidden within these gallant mannerisms and underneath the proper composure are the lies, prejudice, and pride of man.  It has followed us through the centuries of time, interacting, for better or worse, with every aspect of mankind, poor and rich alike.  In this movie, both Jane and Elizabeth Bennett manage the rare success of finding wealthy men who also are the love of their lives.  Its \\"dreamy.\\"  Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfayden have good chemistry.<br />The witty characters and their costumes, make each scene in this movie very entertaining.<br /><br />Director Joe Wright and screenwriter Deborah Moggach are to be commended for this adaptation of one of Jane Austen's finest works.<br />A wonderful movie, buy it, it's a keeper.....

0143038419|3.0|Listen, we all have gone or will go through a rough patch in our lives.  I always thought that the secret to 'overcoming' trauma was to get over yourself and to not mull around and self-indulge.  This is where the friction between me and Elizabeth Gilbert begin... After about half-way through reading Eat, Pray, Love, I had had enough with Elizabeth...she's way too self indulgent. This book has more \\"I's\\" than China...  Also, I can certainly understand and appreciate ones desire to exercise their emotions (changing their jobs...moving...etc.) but I can't help but think that someone would honestly need more than 2 years to find themself.  To give her some credit, I'm glad she finally had the balls to face her unhappy life and do something about it. Although I feel sorry that she hasn't been able to surround herself with people whom she can be herself around. As for the yoga in India bit...a real bore. Plus, for someone who claims to understand yoga...she sure doesn't act in accordance.

BTW - listen to execution in the middle of Unknown Soldier - it is quite stupid remixed (execution squad stands right, shots sound from left e.g.!!)

B000V8I2QU|5.0|To start, October 16th is bosses day, and Bruce Springsteen prove with this album why he is the boss.  I was young when Born in the U.S.A was his big album, and never really have explored his past works, only listening to them when they came on the radio.  When I the first single on this album, Radio Nowhere, it intriged me, so I decided to buy this album.  I must say, I really like this album, a harder edge with many songs, but some great change up and classic sounding songs, with Bruce sounding his best.  This album has sparked me to go back and check out his earlier works and apreciate them more.  So don't hesitate, get this album, well worth the money.
B000UJBYD8|3.0|While it's not on par with the classic Cult discs, I think this is better than Ceremony as a whole and way better than the Beyond Good and Evil garbage. Dirty Little Rockstar (despite its similarity to the Stones and Primal Scream), Sound of Destruction, and Tiger Burning in the Sun are really good songs. By the way, the self-titled disc from 94 is vastly underrated.
B000URDEB0|5.0|So before I actually throw myself into writing this review, I'd like to provide a little background so that people know where I'm coming from.  Being in the States, we really don't have access to the AWESOME metal that comes from the Nordic region, so I got into Nightwish pretty late in the game: 2003.  But from the opening strains of the first Nightwish song I ever heard (\\"Bless the Child\\"), I was hooked.  Tarja's voice, Tuomas' genius as a composer, the choir, the orchestra, the lyrics ...their music just SPOKE to me.  To date, I own all of their albums, and drive my husband nuts by playing them ALL THE TIME.  So you can imagine, I was pretty floored when Tarja was kicked out of the band.  I wasn't \\"angry\\" like some other fans, because I understood that Tarja did not make Nightwish.  Tuomas, Jukka, Marco, and of course Emppu make the band.  But believe me, I loved Tarja, and I still do.  She's amazing.  Anyway, so I bought this album with quite a bit of trepidation, which I'm sure a lot of Nightwish fans can identify with.  I am a HUGE Nightwish fan (there is only one other band I'll call myself a fan of, just to give you some perspective, though there are many bands I like), and I was curious as to whether they would lose anything in the inevitable change.  I need not have worried.  From the opening strains of \\"Poet and the Pendulum\\" to the closing of \\"Meadows of Heaven\\", the album is nothing short of awe-inspiring.  Anette is not Tarja, but she brings something to the band that is all her own.  And the second word of the album title really fits:  PASSION.  This recording is the EPITOME of passion.  I also love that Marco sings more on this album than he did on previous ones, and I think Nightwish got back the edge that they had started to lose around the time Century Child was released.  \\"Once\\" was great, and inspiring, but it was starting to sound...well...not unique.  On \\"Dark Passion Play\\" the edge that I discovered when I delved deep into \\"Oceanborn\\" and \\"Wishmaster\\" is BACK.  AND, because the songs are much longer than the average Nightwish song (\\"Poet and the Pendulum\\" and \\"7 Days to the Wolves\\" both clock in at over ten minutes, and \\"Master Passion Greed\\" clocks in at just over six minutes), I don't imagine that they would get a lot of radio play, lol.  If you were a bigger fan of their older stuff as opposed to the last two productions, this one will please you.  Anette may be different, but change is not always a bad thing.  And there is a LOT on this album that will appeal to Nightwish's older fans (as well as probably bring in some new ones)!  \\"Master Passion Greed\\" is one of those songs that you can't help but bang your head to (think, \\"Slaying the Dreamer\\" from \\"Century Child)(and listen for what the trumpets do at the end, the \\"WAAAH WAAAAH.\\"  It's awesome, and lots of fun to duplicate), \\"Poet and the Pendulum\\" will take you to new heights, \\"Eva\\" will soothe after the strains of \\"Master Passion Greed\\" come to an end...and is it just me, or is the VERY beginning of \\"Sahara\\" sort of remniscient of the beginning of \\"Pyre of Gods\\" by Tarot (Marco's band)? Maybe it's just the keyboard notes.  The rest of it is totally different, though. And I don't care what anyone says, \\"7 Days to the Wolves\\" is a terrific song.  Truthfully, since I've only had the album since yesterday, I haven't picked a favorite yet, but the ones I mentioned are my favorites SO FAR.  I'm sure that'll change once I've driven my husband nuts listening to it all day every day.  Heh heh.    I know my review probably isn't as good as the others, but I hope if you're with me still, I've helped you decide to get \\"Passion Play\\" if you haven't already.  It really is a terrific album.  I don't miss Tarja anymore.
B000WSJNWQ|4.0|When a bomb explodes in an unnamed North African city, chief suspect Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Metwally) is illegally arrested by the CIA upon his arrival in the States, and whisked out of the country for interrogation. When he doesn't arrive home, Anwar's wife Isabella (Witherspoon) travels to Washington to ask friend Alan Smith (Peter Sarsgaard), aid to Senator Hawkins (Alan Arkin), who in turn is tight with anti-terrorist head Corrine Whitman (Streep), for help. Meanwhile, rookie CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (Gyllenhaal), shaken from the bombing that killed his superior, observes Anwar's torture carried out by the tough interrogator and original bomb target Fawal (Igal Naor), whose mind is elsewhere as his daughter Fatima (Zineb Oukach) has been missing for a week. The term 'Rendition' is the kidnapping of terrorist suspects who are then flown into countries where torture is the norm, and Tsotsi director Gavin Hood tackles both sides of the argument. Blurring the lines between right and wrong was always going to be a tough one to pull off, but Hood, along with scriptwriter Kelley Sane, manage it while patiently crafting together the multi-narrative story that climaxes in a cracking twist ending. But for once, a film's success doesn't rely on the believability of the twist; Rendition was an engaging film regardless, and when that twist unexpectedly crops up it's the cherry, not the cake. It's hard to fault anything in Rendition: the story is believable, the characters are well-rounded and fleshed-out, it raises some thought-provoking questions and delivers a timely message. The performances are sound too: Gyllenhaal gets slightly better every time he appears, Witherspoon is okay as the brow-furrowing pregnant wife, while Streep does her ice queen thing again.
B000U618C8|1.0|I bought this because of all the hype. That's just what it is, HYPE. This is lame music, folks, lame.   Indie rock? This does not deserve the \\"rock\\" moniker in any way, shape, or form. It does not ROCK. This would put a ADD suffering 3rd grader on a sugar high to sleep. I bet even Mr Rogers would tell this kid to quit being such a weenie.

Simply said, I want everyone to own this here CD, becuase it is fantastic. YIPPEEEEE

B000LPQ6DE|4.0|I have to start off with the fact that I have not read the book.  My first exposure to Jane Eyre was the 1990's version with William Hurt.  I did not like it at all.  Even though it had a \\"happy ending\\", I felt like something was missing.  Then I watched the 1970's version with Timothy Dalton - - that is when I realized that there was so much more to the story than what was in the William Hurt version.      Nevertheless, I enjoyed this movie.  I did not find it to be overly affectionate or have any inappropriate scenes in it.  I can't comment on how it compares to the book, but I thought it did a good job of telling a complete story with little or no holes.      My one dissapointment was how they made Mr. Rochester out to be at the end of the movie.   He did not like really hurt at all - to me, he looked pretty much the same.  Toby Stephens is great to look at, so it did not bother me all that much.  I also like the ending with the family portrait - I thought that was a good way to end it.
0783225849|5.0|What more can be said about Pscycho?  A great film by Hitchcock, especially given the fact it was made in 1960.  Like most well-known films, its langauge and characters have entered into popular conscious.    There are several radical things about the film.  The first is Janet Leigh, who was given star billing on the film, was killed in the famous shower scene within the first thirty minutes of the film.  Another daring move at the time is one of the opening scenes, in which she is shown in her bra, a thing very risque to show on film at the time, as well as her and her lover, who she is not married too, displayed in the same bed.  Also Hitchcock showed a toilet flushing in the film in an area where you would never see a toilet, let alone one flushing.  Hitchcock had to fight for the film against the censors, including the shower scene and the use of the word \\"transvestite\\" in the film.    But perhaps most radical of all is his ingenious use of Norman Bates.  For most of the film is told from his perspective, and by the end until the final revelation you are very sympathetic toward Bates and feel anger toward his domineering mother.  It is only when the twist is revealed do you realise you must examine all your previous attitudes toward Bates that Hitchcock had so delicately been cultivating throughout the course of the film.    The film is one of the most famous horror pictures ever produced.  For those new movie makers who want to make an effective horror flick, this is a good place to start in seeing how a universally acknowledged genius at directing made his horror film.  The shower scene, probably the most famous of Hitchcock's career, is especially intriguing, as you actually see no real gore at all, yet the scene scares the hell out of you when you watch it and you can't help but imagine all the gore that must be taking place.  Indeed, Janet Leigh was so traumatized that in later years she would not take showers unless absolutely forced too, and then only with all doors and windows shut and locked.    Overall, one of Hitchcock's best.  This DVD has no real extras, but for a budget-line release it's a good edition to buy of this amazing film.           For all you Bob Dylan fans out there, on his 1964 album ANOTHER SIDE OF BOB DYLAN, he references this film in the lyrics to one of his songs.  From Motopsycho Nightmare:     `There stood Rita  Lookin' just like Tony Perkins.  She said, \\"Would you like to take a shower?  I'll show you up to the door.\\"  I said, \\"Oh, no! no!  I've been through this movie before.\\"'
B000F2C87Q|5.0|After listening to the first 2 tracks I had to pick up the jewel case to see if this was some band playing with Junior Kimbrough. Absolutely FANTASTIC. If this was vinyl I'd be playing the grooves off of this.
B000SO7OL6|5.0|Considering that this is the first compilation of the very best of Diana Krall's recordings, it is an essential add-on to all her fans. The 15 gorgeous songs were perfectly selected from seven of her most remarkable albums starting off with George and Ira Gershwin's gem of gems, \\"'S Wonderful\\" down to Bart Howard's most charming composition and an all-time favorite of mine, \\"Fly Me To The Moon\\" . . .<br /><br />\\"And let me play among the stars<br />Let me see what Spring is like<br />On Jupiter and Mars<br />In other words, hold my hand<br />In other words, I love you\\"<br /><br />Although I have listened to and enjoyed all these songs from the CDs  this compilation was taken, I still think that this CD is a great addition to my collection since it features the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me from all of her recordings. You don't have to skip any track for every song is truly a charmer and a winner. Who can resist the beauty of these all-time favorites of mine? These are spellbinding songs of the heart that can create wonderful memories you'll treasure forever.<br /><br />\\"'S Wonderful\\" - Claus Ogerman's flawless Bossa Nova arrangement and orchestration with the Los Angeles Session Orchestra and Krall's sublime vocal and piano artistry made this standard an absolute gem of gems that would have made the Gershwin Brothers so proud since it's the best interpretation ever recorded.<br /><br />\\"You made my life so glamorous<br />You can't blame me for feeling amorous<br />'S wonderful, marvelous<br />That you should care for me\\"<br /><br />\\"The Look of Love\\" - a charming ditty from Burt Bacharach and Hal David that will make any music lover fall in love with its melody and lyric. Once again, Claus Ogerman brought out the very best in Krall with his arranging expertise and Krall gives this song the ultimate radiance it so deserves.<br /><br />\\"The look of love<br />Is saying so much more<br />Than just words could ever say<br />And what my heart has heard<br />Well it takes my breath away\\"<br /><br />\\"You Go To My Head\\" - a favorite of great singers to record and one of the masterworks of J. Fred Coots and Haven Gillespie. Another Claus Ogerman superb arrangement and orchestration with the London Session Orchestra. This will be a treat to your ears for it's a previously unreleased track.<br /><br />\\"You go to my head<br />And you linger like a haunting refrain<br />And I find you spinning 'round in my brain<br />Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne\\"<br /><br />\\"Let's Face The Music And Dance\\" - the most remarkable and captivating version of this Irving Berlin classic. Another majestic orchestral arrangement by Johnny Mandel, conducted by himself and Eddie Karam.<br /><br />\\"So while there's moonlight and music<br />And love and romance<br />Let's face the music and dance\\"<br /><br />\\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\" - Cole Porter's most enduring song and one of the most recorded standards. Who wouldn't be enchanted by Johnny Mandel's brilliant orchestral arrangement? I would say Krall gives it the retire-the-trophy-treatment for a female vocal rendition.<br /><br />\\"And deep in my heart<br />You're really a part of me<br />I have got you under my skin\\"<br /><br />And last but not least . . .<br /><br />\\"East of the Sun (And West of the Moon)\\" - a very nice song penned by Brooks Bowman featuring Krall on vocals and piano with Anthony Wilson (guitar), John Clayton (bass) and Jeff Hamilton (drums).<br /><br />\\"Just you and I<br />Forever and a day<br />Love will not die<br />We'll keep it that way<br />Up among the stars we'll find<br />A harmony of life to a lovely tune<br />East of the sun and west of the moon\\"<br /><br />Diana Krall is an icon of elegance in music and she has a penchant for reviving sweetly sentimental songs that are completely pleasing to the ears with her soft, mellow and sultry vocal art that is as sweet as pie. And this compilation CD \\"The Very Best of Diana Krall\\" is a testament of her love and passion to her craft, and a must-have not only to her fans, but also to lovers of great music.<br /><br />Wholeheartedly recommended for your listening pleasure!<br /><br />P.S.

B00004I9VE|1.0|Please refrain from buying this title! Save your money! Myself, being a Jackson fan, found heartbreaking to realize what Sony has been trying to do to keep SACD alive. Lets understand that the beauty of DSD lies not only in its surround capabilities, but also in the unrivalled purity of its sound. The best SACD recordings you will ever hear are PURE DSD. This means: Source (instruments, voice, etc.) recorded on DSD, and not only re-mastered from tape. The irony lies in the fact that most of the titles that WE as consumers would pick from the shelf are NOT new releases, but rather hits from the past; making the whole native DSD capture at the time of the studio recording, impossible! Further more, there is another tragic fate: Tape deteriorates over time!!!! Back in the days of Thriller's release, engineers would order immediate mastering and duplication of the finished production, as many claimed to hear a deterioration of sound with just a few weeks past completion. IMAGINE WHAT 20 YEARS WILL DO!!! Brave attempt by Bernie Grundman (Mastering engineer for SACD), but futile. Use your ears! I have been a professional recording engineer for 12 years now, and A/B compared this SACD and the original CD released in the 80's. Its an unfair comparison CD WINS BY FAR, it is fuller, clearer, fatter and not as abrasive on the highs as the SACD, thanks to the fact that it was digitalized at an early age of the tape master.  Bottom Line: If you don't own Thriller, get the CD. It is one of Pop's historic jewels.
0061547832|5.0|Strongly recommended. I was very pleased with this team-up. Trump and Zanker have done what many mega millionaires don't take the time to do - share not just how they got where they are, but how they think and deal with different situations! Trump and Zanker talk about mentoring and how important it is.  Obviously Zanker's mentor is Trump and Zanker is proof of how successful mentoring can be.    Life is tough and you really need to protect yourself.  Trump and Zanker talk about this and are very frank about real life and real life situations.  They don't sugar coat anything.  Some of their experiences directly relate to what I'm currently going through.    The bottom line is, we need to take control of our finances or someone else will!  I'm really going to take a hard look at my finances and property and make sure I've got it protected.  Someone is bound to screw me sometime.    The book is written in a very simple, easy to read, conversational tone. Read about some of their mistakes and life experiences. I appreciate them for sharing and caring enough to write it!

B000UJ48XG|3.0|There have been quite a few cases of indie bands and projects just kind of \\"throwing\\" their debut album out there, not knowing what to expect; just to see what happens. And, *gasp* people love it! Pitchfork gives the debut if not a 8/10, then at least a mostly positive review. The band goes on tour, the vast majority of people enjoy their live show. Some time passes and it is the turn for the band to record a follow up album. Their opportunities in the studio have now expanded from the profits made via album sales and shows. The big challenge here is to skillfully shift their sound forward. Beirut's situation is one example of all this.     I thought the \\"Gulag Orkestar\\" was a very good album. It definitely had something new to offer to the circuits of independent music. \\"The Flying Club Cup\\" is an attempt to take the sound of Orkestar to the next level and apply a new concept to it. All I have to say is that I didn't find anything impressive about \\"The Flying Club Cup\\". Absolutely nothing new here. It in fact reminded me a lot of the soundtrack to Amelie. I can also hear way too much digital editing done to tracks here, all in all making it sound too \\"plastic\\", especially for the type of instruments used in these songs. The sound of TFCC does not \\"breathe\\" due to being way too polished. The instruments that guys from Beirut play need to sound raw and much more alive. Tow Waits, for example, records his albums from one take for that very reason.     Some songs on TFCC have nice melodies like \\"Nantes\\", \\"La Banlieue\\", \\"Cliquot\\". Other than that, songs are \\"too carefully\\" written and constructed, as if Zach Condon was afraid to try something completely different from \\"Gulag Orkestar\\". It's a nice album to listen to occasionally, but the catchiness of it dies away quite quickly.
B00001OH7O|4.0|Bowie's third official album is also the most varied, ranging from folk to rock and roll. \\"Changes\\" was the big single of the album and it placed well after he scored with \\"Space Oddity\\" the year before. Bowie brings in the folksy guitar work from the \\"Space Oddity\\" album with the sarcastically anthemic songs to two heroes of the period: \\"Andy Warhol\\" and \\"Song For Bob Dylan\\", neither being exactly complimentary. \\"Kooks\\" and \\"Fill Your Heart\\" are silly pop ditties that truly seem flowery and goofy. The most undated song here is \\"Life On Mars\\", a song Bowie opened his 2002 tour with and one that Barbra Streisand covered. Few songs surpass its odd lyrics and weird imagery (Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow?). \\"Bewlay Brothers\\" has some nice guitar work, but is an odd duck out in an already funky album. \\"Queen Bitch\\" is the one cut that foresaw Bowie's next move towards the \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" sound. The digitally remastered sound is fantastic and this should receive as much attention as \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" or \\"Aladdin Sane\\".<br /><br />As far as Enhanced goes, it is well remastered, but you also just get an add when you place the CD in your computer - that's it.
B0001HAHXW|1.0|Right off the bat, it's pretty presumptuous for Eric Clapton to list himself first in the title.  Maybe I am nit-picking, but I think \\"Mr. Johnson and Me\\" sounds better and shows props by putting the real bluesman's name first.  That said, the music on this CD is self-indulgent, pasteurized, homogenized, smoothed-over white-boy blues without a scintilla of character, emotion, soul or meaning.  It is criminally bland.  Clapton is arguably one of the great guitar geniuses of the last 50 years, but if he is, he doesn't show it here.  Blues is supposed to sweat, moan, scream, and even mumble sometimes; Clapton just plays and sings by the numbers.  This music wouldn't unsettle a postage stamp.  That whirring noise you hear is Mr. Johnson spinning in his grave.
B000LC55F2|4.0|I won't retell the story, but I found this to be a very well-made film with a lot of intricacies to hold my attention.  It is a story of competition, love, vengeance, betrayal and blind ambition.  It ranges from the grimy streets of London to the mountainous vistas of Colorado.  While it could be described as a dramatic period piece, it also manages to work in a bit of science fiction.  While many seemed to be put off by this combination, I thought that it was quite well done via the appearance of Nikola Tesla (played by David Bowie).<br /><br />While the story was complex and wide-ranging, I found very few of the logical flaws that are common in such films (such as \\"The Illusionist\\").  Although I figured out most of the tricks and twists before they were revealed, they were still very interesting.<br /><br />I always can find a few flaws:  I thought Scarlett Johansson's accent wasn't very convincing.  I thought the cinematography was overly dark (although, perhaps, realistic) - certainly not the eye candy of \\"The Illusionist.\\"  I wasn't entirely happy with the way the ending was handled...<br /><br />But, overall, a very good film.
B000R8YC1I|4.0|I have seen this DVD before but never had one of my own. I enjoy fantasy and this is one of my favorites. I would have preferred full screen, but the wide screen version is nice. If you like fantasy, I would recommend this this one.
B000QUCNOK|3.0|Jean-Baptiste, an orphan born in the street markets of England, possesses an extraordinary sense of smell.  Obsessesed with the scent of a woman (pure innocence), he goes mad trying to learn how to preserve that very scent.<br /><br />With a narrator telling this slow drawn out tale, the viewer is quickly enamored by the \\"Hannibal-like\\" tone of this movie.  I know I was!  I enjoyed the long drawn out scenes of silence as the narrator weaves the tell of Jean-Baptiste and his quest in becoming a fine perfume maker.<br />Dustin Hoffman is brilliant as the aging mentor!<br /><br />Those who love a mad thriller that builds you up with frightening anticipation will not be disappointed...that is...until the very end.  The gore is not too over the top.  The lead's obsessions with smells is a bit kinky, even funny at times, but totally understandable in the script.<br /><br />Let's talk about the ending...I won't spoil it for you here but I will tell you it's way over the top and just silly.  It doesn't fit the tone of the rest of the movie.  It's too supernatural like and totally unexpected given the events that have already taken place.<br /><br />Here's what should have happened and would have left this viewer a bit more satisfied...Jean-Baptiste should have been executed for his crimes.  Done!  Finished!  The lead dies!  He has to.  He's already been caught.  However, maybe a few days later his 13 bottles of oil samples are discovered by a child playing in the barn where Jean-Baptiste worked.  The child opens the 13th bottle and takes a whiff.  The camera comes in close on the child's nose and the nostrils inhaling, the same scene we are first treated to in the beginning of the movie.  It's enough to let us know, or at least let us think, this child posesses the same quality and maybe a new perfume maker (killer) will be born.  The End.<br /><br />For those who are fans of movies like Silence of the Lambs, From Hell, or any Jack the Ripper, old England-type scary movies, definitely don't miss out on this one.  You'll feel cheated in the end, but it's definitely worth a look.You'll feel cheated in the end, but it's definitely worth a look.
0553296981|5.0|As just about every other student, I read The Diary of Anne Frank in middle school, probably during the 6th or 7th grade.  I had a distant memory of it, but not much.  Well, recently I watched Schindler's List and this got me re-interested in WWII, and especially the Holocaust.  I read Night by Eli Wiesel (highly recommended) and decided to move on to The Diary of Anne Frank.  Let me start by reviewing the book:<br /><br />The Diary of Anne Frank is a diary of a young, Jewish girl (as the title obviously states, haha) whom is forced to go into hiding with her family during the Nazi occupation of Holland in the early 1940's.  During this period, Jews were being segregated and even sent off to concentration camps by the Germans on a daily basis.  When Anne's sister's name was next on the list, their father decided to take the family into hiding.<br /><br />Aided by some of Otto's (Anne's father) former employees, the Franks seclude themselves in a small Annex of a business in Amsterdam.  There, they are joined by the Van Daan family and later by an older gentleman, Mr. Dussel.  Anne's diary chronicles their plight for the following two years, until they are discovered by the German secret police and ultimately sent to their death in Jewish concentration camps.<br /><br />Anne addresses various topics, from their daily activities, to her interest in the son of the Van Daan's, Peter, to some of her inner most thoughts, fears, and aspirations.  I have to share with you that I was EXTREMELY impressed with Anne's intelligence.  I couldn't help but compare her to myself when I was only 15 years old and I am amazed not only at her intelligence but her strength to persevere during such horrible times.  This young girl manages to keep faith in God and struggles with maintaining her morality, even as all around her she is witnessing a warped world full of sin, hatred and evil.  I cannot say that in her shoes I would've reacted the same.<br /><br />I encourage any reader to read and/or re-read The Diary of Anne Frank.  You will be completely enveloped by her wit and warmth and are surely to fall in love with her.and/or re-read The Diary of Anne Frank.

When they released the cult in 94 it wasn't my favorite but over the years I have come to discover the genius of this album. To all you haters I will see you in ten years, when you finally catch up!
0143038419|5.0|This book was very inspiring.  Of course it was self-indulgent, it was a story about the character finding herself.  I personally needed this book to get out of my own funk (no, I wasn't divorced or a miserable housewife, I just had been devoting my whole self to everyone and everything else around me).  Though the whole process E.G. went through wasn't for me personally, it was good to see what she learned on her journey to self-discovery!  And many of her lessons can be applied to everyday life to remind yourself of what's really important!

B000QQFKYE|4.0|The more complex and longest Lynch movie.<br /><br />I it was hilarious how people at the local theater i went out to see this movie whith a friend of mine, exit the room one by one, poor people i will do the same if i went out to see a teenage movie or shrek.<br /><br />This is a movie that gives you free interpretation, if you expect to have a  linear story, with a meaning, you are lost. It kept my mind in full for about 2 days, and at the end realize a way to \\"understand\\" this film on my own.

0679735259|5.0|In my opinion there are two books on war that stand apart from all others: Stephen Crane's \\"Red Badge of Courage\\" and Michael Herr's \\"Dispatches.\\" In fact, I consider the latter one of the best books ever written. It is soul-level stuff and I can think of few books that have ever so easily transported me to a place and time and left me feeling edgy. There is a reason so much of Herr's material didn't simply ended up in the films \\"Apocalypse Now\\" and \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" but also became some of the most memorable lines in the films. A brilliant book and one that should be read by anyone concerned about our most recent antics in Iraq.
B000VH3FV8|4.0|Yet, when it comes to great R&B crooners, we really don't have many legends to really enjoy these days anymore that are fresh and new. It is sad, especially when those we really look up to pass on. When Luther Vandross died two years ago, his soul was and his sensual voice was a deep reminder of what a definitive singer could really be. For three decades in the spotlight, he has crafted and recorded some of the most elegantly crafted songs ever on the radio and for listeners and lovers everywhere. With today, we are often more into rap performers and Hip Hop, where the softeness of soul is often overlooked from the deep heart, which is sad. While there have been so many different hits albums that came out with Luther Vandross's talent, no box set has ever been issued, until now.<br /><br />The 2007 Love, Luther, is a 4 disc box set that does a decent job at reintroduces Luther Vandross and his velvetly, sexy voice from his delightful eras in the music industry. The collection includes all of his standards from classic covers, to his mix of Hip Hop Soul that blends in lover's and their souls' everywhere. The collection includes live material, from his classic duets, and his best in soul. The collection includes 60 great tracks including demos and extended tracks. The collection includes great tracks including classics like The Power Of Love/Love Power, Anyone Who Had A Heart, Don't Want To Be A Fool, and Stop To Love, to his collaborations with Dionne Warwick (How Many Times Can We Say Goodbye) and Mariah Carey (Endless Love), all the way to his last recordings including the somber Dance With My Father and I'd Rather. There are also a few treats here including never-before heard recordings including Funky Music, a song Luther Vandross performed during his early days as a part of the R&B group Luther, and Georgy Porgy when he recorded with Charme.<br /><br />While the box set Love, Luther shines brightly, there are a couple of disadvantages to the collection. The first disadvantage is that the collection doesn't list the songs in chronologial order, which does confuse new listeners, as well as keeps things a little bit misorganized for die hard fans unlike other box sets. Another disadvantage to the album is that while the collection includes a lot of great songs, there are a few great tracks that were overlooked like his rendidtions of Heatwave's Always & Forever, and Going In Circles, as well as Think About You.<br /><br />Despite those few flaws, Love, Luther works great in price and value as a noble re-introduction to Luther Vandross, that works well for die hard fans and anyone who hasn't yet heard a Lutehr Vandross song on the radio. While there have been so many different collections of Luther Vandross's soul that've been made, this one works as a nice treat for anyone who is in the mood for any love that Luther's soul keeps bringing out.<br /><br />Album Cover: A-<br /><br />Songs: B+<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Remastering: A-<br /><br />Overall: B+is that the collection doesn't list the songs in chronologial order, which does confuse new listeners, as well as keeps things a little bit misorganized for die hard fans unlike other box sets.

B0002NRQTS|3.0|RUSH - Presto  ( *** )  11 tracks  (52:15)<br /><br />This is part four of a comprehensive four part series of Music Reviews of the Progressive Rock band Rush. This is a band that has been around now for over 30 years, and has gone though many musical phases. I consider the bands 1990 releases as their \\"Contemporary period\\".  Albums included are Presto (1989), Roll the Bones (1991), Counterparts (1993), Test for Echo (1996), and Different Stages \\"Live\\" (1998).<br /><br />Presto represents many changes for Rush.  A New Record Label (Atlantic).  Another new producer, Rupert Hine, and the band's first true compact disc length release at 52 minutes, breaking a long line of 40 minute 8 song albums.  The records over-all sound is a definite change from previous offerings.  Neil Peart's tighter drum sound, Geddy's almost mid-range bass, and Alex's semi-acoustic guitar riffs mark a shift to this \\"Contemporary period\\" for the band and the fans.  Sorry, but I can only give this thing 3 stars.  I only own it because I'm a Rush completist and have all their albums.<br /><br />Presto is one of my least favorite Rush albums.  Almost none of the songs ever really grabbed me.  There are a few stand-outs, but also the un-sonic clarity of the sound of this album I think was also a turn-off.  The band considers \\"The Pass\\" as one of the best songs they have ever written.  Geddy Lee describes Presto as kind of a \\"warm-up\\" record to their next release, Roll the Bones, which has far superior writing on it compared to Presto.<br /><br />Best Track: Show Don't Tell

0143038419|5.0|The author suffers a terrible divorce and decides to hit the road in search of spiritual fulfillment. The journey she undertakes turns out to be meaningful and also quite funny. I think the book was superb in many ways. The author becomes a strong woman able to take care of herself. There's a lot of growth of spirit. And most of all, the essays are FUNNY. Along with 'Race You To The Fountain of Youth' I think this is the funniest collection of essays of 2007.  Also recommended [[ASIN:1434322580 Understanding: Train of Thought]].
B000UOOT1W|4.0|Undoubtingly, when it comes to great music these days, we really don't seem to hear anything good on the radio. Back in 1999, we were reminded of what great music was like to a whole new generation. When santana, returned to the airwaves with his smash collaborations comeback album, Supernatural, many listeners were introduced to a guitar legend who has thrived for over 4 decades of great music. Yet, there have been so many different hits collections that really have shown Santana in many ways, but there hasn't been one that shows the best of his recent comeback era. That answer has been called for on this new hits collection that reintroduces the old, and expands the anew.<br /><br />The 2007 Ultimate Santana brings in his four decades of great rock music, blending Carlos Santana's blend of Rock that spans as a nice reintroduction to his greatest works. The collection mainly focuses in on his comeback period from 1999's Supernatural to today. The collection is all about his collaborations here, including some new recordings that continue to try to capture his spiritual light. The collection includes some of his classics like Evil Ways and Black Magic Woman from his first era, while his second era includes great collaborations including the smash Smooth with Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty, Put You Light On with ex-rapper Everlast, and the upbeat and down to Earth The Game Of Love with Michelle Branch, and a never-before heard rendidition of that song with Tina Turner. The collection also brings in some new blood with collaborations with Jennifer Lopez on This Boy's Fire, and Chad Kroger from Nickelback on Into The Light, which are fair but not anything to rave over.<br /><br />While the album does overlook Santana's 80's period, and a few great songs like I Feel For You with Michelle Branch, Ultimate Santana is a welcoming greatest hits album for new fans as well as those who just want the die hard hits. It works as a great hits package for your music collection, and I still enjoy listening to Carlos and his guitar soul, and that is Smooth.<br /><br />Album Cover: A-<br /><br />Songs: B 1/2-<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Remastering: B+<br /><br />Overall: Bistening to Carlos and his guitar soul, and that is Smooth.

B000002IOY|5.0|Over Kill is without a doubt one of the premier thrash metal bands, and if you ask me this is their best work. This is really where the band developed a real groove in their music, and the songs are all amazing. They did slow it down a little bit for this album, but I think this is the heaviest stuff they've done. Here's a track overview:    \\"Time To Kill\\" (5/5) - A heavy song that you can just feel in your bones.    \\"Elimination\\" (5/5) - To this day remains a calling card for Over Kill, a pure thrash classic.    \\"I Hate\\" (5/5) - A song all about living your own life and not putting up with anyone.    \\"Nothing To Die For\\" (5/5) - Probably the weakest track on the album, that being said as far as I'm concerned it's better than anything Metallica ever put out. Also, has cool bass break in the middle of it.    \\"Playing With Spiders/Skullkrusher\\" (10/5) - The HEAVIEST song ever recorded by anybody anywhere, Blitz's vocals are so brutal in the chorus, and when you listen to this song you can just feel the Skullkrusher coming after you.    \\"Birth of Tension\\" (5/5) - Powerful as anything else here, fits nicely with the rest.    \\"Who Tends The Fire\\" (5/5) - Second best track on the album after \\"Skullkrusher.\\"    \\"The Years of Decay\\" (5/5) - The title track is definitely very cool, worthy of having the entire album named after it.     \\"Evil Never Dies\\" (5/5) - The title says it all.    So all in all it's a killer album, as far as I'm concerned. If nothing else at all this is worth owning just for the fifth track. If you call yourself a metal head and don't own this, then you are a disgrace. Also,  you should check out every other Over Kill album on the market, because not a single one of them falls short of being amazing.

B0000TB03W|4.0|I have liked Shania Twain's voice and ability since her Come On Over CD. I always find music more interesting when you can watch the singer or orchestra when they perform. I regret that I have not had the opportunity to be present at a live concert. She is also talented and puts on a very entertaining performance. I like her band, the huge stage and her interaction with the audience. I would have given this concert five stars but I have to agree with one of the other reviews that commented on the fact that the camera shots changed to rapidly and did not stay with any one person or instrument but just for a second of two. But that does not take away from her music, writing and performing. For those points I would give the DVD five stars.
0689865384|3.0|I guess I expected a little bit more out of this book. However, I really like the idea of it, and the issues that the author brought to light because they are so relevant to girls today.  There were parts of the book that I thought could have been better, such as the Tally/David romance, or Tally's character development; and I think it would have been helpful to have a little bit more description of the setting and some of the technology used in the futuristic world of this book.  I realize that this book was aimed towards young teen girls though (I'm 22 years old), and keeping that in mind, it was very interesting for light, summer vacation reading. Overall, it's a nice little story and I look forward to reading Pretties. Kudos to Scott Westerfeld for creating a book with a positive message for today's teens.
B000VL9XNI|5.0|Well, being a long time AC/DC fanatic, I guess I am baised when it comes to releases like this.  I own just about everything they have turned out.  The quality and depth of this DVD set surprises even I.  There are so many tracks, so many great never before seen interviews it is downright a crime to not get this as an AC/DC fan.<br /><br />As much as I love Brian Johnson, watching Bon Scott tear it up on stage in front of a live crowd is incredible.  My god, he was such an amazing frontman, the best there was.  Ever.  By all accounts he was a very approachable, likable guy.  When he is singing, it seems like he is singing just for you; with a wink of his eye, a flash of his smile, he just flat out made it happen.<br /><br />Let's not forget Angus who has more energy wrapped into his tiny frame than a nuclear explosion.  I've seen them twice in concert, '96 and '01 respectively and I can say with authority how electrifying they are live.  When they play live they sound better than they do on recordings. It is amazing.<br /><br />When Brian steps into being, they are dialed up to infinity and have  grinded it out again anad again for over two decades.  I just can't say how much this DVD collection expresses how great this band really is.  Hail, hail to the Kings of Rock!
B000UJ24SC|5.0|The Black Dahlia Murder (TBDM) keep upping the ante in the realm of melodically influenced death metal with their most recent release: 'Nocturnal'. First, I was curious after listening to 'Unhallowed', then I was a sure fire fan after 'Miasma', and now I am wondering how these guys keep churing out the best american death metal yet! With the addition of drummer Shannon Lucas, they are in synch like never before. Brian Eschbach(sp?)pretty much wrote the whole thing and it is damn near a masterpiece. John Kempanien's (sp?) lead work is once again OUTSTANDING. Ryan Williams' bass is on time and flawless... oh yeah and you can actually hear the bass guitar on this record! And Trevor Strnad has returned to his thematic horror narrative, weaving a tapestry of black gore and fear throughout every track. Whereas 'Miasma' had some of the same lyrical content as 'Unhallowed' save for a few songs about partying (i'm charming, vice campaign, Miasma etc..), 'Nocturnal' is a clear journey back to their roots on the 'Unhallowed' record. One thing I have noticed on every record from TBDM is that the members of the band aren't bound to one another musically. Each one of then plays independently from one another. You hear bassist Williams playing something besides the same riffs as the rhythm guitar, but he still stays locked in with drummer Lucas. And in case you haven't looked in your CD booklet, there is only one lead singer in TBDM. All of the vocals on this record are done by Strnad. Live, Rhythm guitarist Eschbach fills in some. But an amazing talent to switch from the 'Growl' of death metal, to more of an 'At the Gates' style scream. One last thing: no filler songs on this record, which is great. My picks for fave tracks: 'Warborn', 'What a Horrible Night to Have a Curse', 'Deathmask Divine' um... naw... the whole album is awesome, no need for fave tracks. If you get a chance to see them live, do so. Awesome show. No posturing, just five guys ripping the stage and having fun.

B000V8I2QU|3.0|I  have been to  several  bruce  springteen shows and i own most of his  catalogue. so, i don't think i am a novice to the boss.  this album has some bright moments. but,  58 year old  bruce is  just a bit too distracted  with his  concerns  for the iraq  war and his disdain of the bush adminstration to get a really great  album off the ground.  the lyrics on a couple of songs are  very good ( last to die ). on  other songs, ( i'll work for your love ) the  words are forced.    I watched a  few of bruce's live videos on his website from  his current tour. he seems to be resting on his  laurels  while the e-street band  sleeps.     i am from atlanta  where he  recorded this album and the rising. basically,  bruce sits locked  up with his producer brendan o,  on the horth side of  town.  these two  make all the music and  cut the tracks and then take the  work back for the  street  band to lay on the finishing touches. so, the last two  albums  ought to be titled \\" bruce  and brendan in duet.\\" i think you can see the e street band sleep walking through another \\" statement \\" album.  thank goodness the e street band  can  play. i think they took a bunch of mediocre bruce and brendan songs and  made them above average. now, i know   i am  going against the grain, here by saying the king has no clothes. but, the boss needs to give up on using his high school diploma to  write editorials into his  music and  go back to  rocking the house. or, maybe this is  what comes  of a rocker pushing 60.
B000EU1PKK|5.0|My old cat peed on it, so no cover is left. I bought it from a local metal record shop for 25 bucks. Its worth it to hear early songs by bands like Running Wild, Hellhammer, and of course Helloween. Also, it features songs by the band \\"Dark Avenger\\" who were never heard from again (I wonder if anyone's ever tried to find out what happened to them).<br /><br />Anyway, I digress. This version (remastered) sounds excellent. Its already an excellent album (in my top ten of all time) but this version sounds better and doesn't clip like a lot of remasters have been (look up the \\"Loudness War\\" on the internet).<br /><br />The bonus disc is a plus, in fact the whole package is basically what any fan would love to have. The two bonus tracks from Death Metal shred, as well as the Remixed versions. I'm not a huge fan of all of Bauerfiend's work (example: the Overproduced last two Blind Guardian albums) but if he were to remix an entire Helloween album, boy it would sound different. I'd say this release is worth those remixes alone.<br /><br />And what is this album? Its the foundation of all modern melodic sounds in metal (in my opinion). The young power metal band comes across like Kill Em All era Metallica covering NWOBHM bands like Satan (Court in the Act era) and of course Iron Maiden (well those are three influences right there). The music is played at a speed and precision that would make modern bands like Dragonforce proud, but its a lot better.<br /><br />In fact, pre-Keepers Era Helloween owes almost as much to early thrash and speed metal than their later era stuff. Getting Michael Kiske wasn't a mistake (they had already used Ralph Scheepers who was the future Gamma Ray and later Primal Fear vocalist for live shows because Kai had trouble singing and playing simultaneously at the time), but they definitely softened things up compared to this album for the Keeper albums and after.<br /><br />Iron Maiden never had guitar harmonies this complex and vicious, and also they play at a speed that would make Kreator proud.<br /><br />Awesome release, this is perfect for newer fans of metal and also somewhat old timers like me who worship Kai Hansen and company.tor proud.    Awesome release, this is perfect for newer fans of metal and also somewhat old timers like me who worship Kai Hansen and company.
B000P0J024|5.0|If you are the least bit a Traveling Wilburys fan, this is a must have. The music is fantastic . . . the DVD is excellent. There was a lot of forethought put into this project. You will not be sorry at all if you purchase this package.
B00005JPFH|3.0|This movie wasn't all that it could've/should've been, especially with certain characters. Venom should have had more screen time, maybe a whole movie. At times it does seem crammed full of too much siht but hey, I go to movies to be entertained, not deeply involved with characters I've seen countless times before. Honestly I hated Spiderman 2. I don't care what others say but SM2 had waaay too much dialouge and not enough of what you expect with a superhero movie, which is the superhero. The movie takes place in New York (of course) and we see Peter and MJ spending time together. Okay skip the useless dialougue here and there we find out Uncle Ben's real killer, see 3 new villians (some cut short in terms of how involved in the marvel universe they are), and see a meteorite crash in Central Park, which, as we soon see, carries a nasty alien. This leads to the black suit, which causes Spiderman to experience mood swings and violent behavior.  This movie had several bleh moments (Peter Parker dancing.....never again) and at times the cast seemed bored. They should have worked the villians into separate films to show more of their developemnt rather than more of a bitchy MJ and a nerdy Peter. Other than that it's entertaining and is worth a view or two.
B0000X61UU|5.0|I have owned this video (yes, vhs!) since just after high school (that's 1994!) and it will always be in my collection of great workouts. It is a fabulous full body work out! You will feel every muscle hurt. I have always gone back to this workout if I got a little out of shape and feel like it pushes you to that next level. It's very athletic in nature but you also are getting personal trainer advise for the cost of the dvd. I will eventually upgrade to the dvd version but you won't be dissapointed in this if you like to work out from home. I also bought her newest one with Kathy Kaehler which is really good as well but not as challenging as this one - however, that was to be expected since it targets new mothers.
0345349571|4.0|\\"A Distant Mirror\\" is a far cry from Tuchman's usual work.  However that shouldn't deter one from picking up this splendid piece of work.  Although the book tends to drag a bit in places, it still holds up well enough to appeal to a general audience and is more than capable of entertaining the reader along the way.         While Tuchman states early that the book will be centered around Edguerrand de Coucy, he doesn't make a truly formal appearance until after the first third of the book.  Instead of striking out to appeal to our sense of pity for this truly confused man pulled between two loves, his country and wife, and seeing how he is constantly swept up in mainstream events, Tuchman comes out of the gate with the sex, religion and life of the average player in the 14th century.         Tuchman does an amazing job making the medieval world come to life, and an even better job creating parallels between our world and the world of the starving peasant and plump noble.  As such her work reads like a modern story set in an older world.  Whether or not one agrees with Tuchman's conclusions becomes irrelevant:  the world she creates is just too good.         The only real problem with the book is that Tuchman tends to repeat herself a little during the work, and it is hard to get past the realization that she is an expert in 20th century American history, not the middle ages.  But if you are interested in learning a little about what life was like for our European ancestors, and if you are willing to see a man whose life will break your heart, then open up the work and dive in.

B000VBIEXS|3.0|I'm unhappy with this one. This is Shout's first miss, and of course it happens here, the album that's probably been effed with more than any other in ELP's catalog...because it's the favorite (although not mine). Marino below is right when he says \\"Karn Evil 9 Pts. 1 & 2\\" are muffled. But so is \\"Still...\\", and there are funny drop-outs (or INs) of sound throughout. \\"Jerusalem\\": \\"Bring me my bow\\" -- did it always go from a 7 to a 9 in volume at that point?? Emerson's shiny background keys are also now erratic in tone, and right where it just breaks your heart and pisses you off that it should be so. I've made sure to get the old Atlantic CD, which at least seemed to follow the vinyl the way it was. And the great packaging? -- I don't think so. They decrease the boundaries of the cover art to make things seem bigger. The Amazon thumbnail doesn't show this. The best thing about this release is the better-sounding bass. Otherwise there is an unforgivable -- and one must fear, irremediable -- muddiness. \\"Benny the Bouncer\\" and the final two impressions of \\"Karn,\\" for now, appear unscathed. Since they didn't hugely increase the overall volume like many other remaster efforts, one might be able to make their own disc from several CDs for a better mix.
B000001GXB|5.0|Why is Pollini's playing so satisfying, even on this less than perfectly recorded and re-engineered CD? For me, it's because he convinces me that every phrase, nay every note, is intentional. That is, he has a total sense of the musical composition and performs every bit of it in coherence with that totality. He also convinces me that he's as close to realizing the Composer's intention -- expressed in the score, the little black notes, all Derridan post-modernism be hanged! -- as humanly possible. Both kinds of intentionalism can only be achieved by the most disciplined technical virtuosity, which no one denies that Pollini had.<br />Thus Pollini never sounds arbitrary and abrupt, never overinterprets one passage only to snooze through the next. In this way, he's the polar opposite of willful interpreters, like Glenn Gould or Angela Hewitt, who demand that their pianistic whims be placed on a par with the composer's efforts. To declare that Pollini is \\"dull\\", as some reviewers have, is to complain about the lack of surface effects for want of hearing the whole sonata.
B000EGEVZK|5.0|The Ramones classic rock band that fans love<br />and critics hate but they still live on today<br />even though most of the members have passed on.<br />It's Alive is worth it for any fan if just for<br />the rare footage of the famous new years eve show<br />in 1977. This show was released as an import only<br />[I have one] and is now on CD. This is not the full<br />show but well worth the price. The other bonus footage<br />is also awesome for any Ramones fam. It has every<br />member here as well as rare footage of Ritchie! If<br />you don't have this get it now!
B000VNMMQG|4.0|Amazing grace  A movie about the ending of the slave trade and the eventual ending of slavery in Britain is a worthy subject in this year of the celebration of the 200th anniversary of its abolition. One should note that this was done, unlike in the United States, by mainly democratic means rather than civil war. Would that all our victories could be won in such a manner but history is replete with many more examples of the necessity for bloody social struggles, win or lose.  The core of this film is however a little disquieting as to its fidelity to historic facts or at least the way they are presented on the screen. In my youth I believed that Wilberforce's parliamentary fight was the key to abolition. While it is impossible to ignore his contribution to the struggle against slavery time and more study have revealed many other factors, not the least the push from below by the working class and other oppressed strata of British society, in contributing to that result. Based solely on the film one would never get the impression that those efforts from below counted and once again we are treated to that timeworn premise that the `great man' was decisive.  Commercial films are not obliged by their nature to be paragons of historical correctness. An informative article in a recent New York Review of Books (June 14, 2007) discusses in greater detail the historical problems than I wish to do here.  While I encourage everyone to see this film (if for not other reason that the magnificent performance by Albert Finney) one should use that as a starting point to investigate the other details about this great struggle to end a heinous crime against blacks and against humanity.
630587493X|4.0|This film does an excellent job in projecting what it sets out to do. The characters are strong and the viewer can easily relate to them.  As a science fiction story, we have to accept certain things that we would otherwise term 'unrealistic'. However what I feel that was grossly overlooked in this movie, were the ethical considerations that 'Andrew' (Robin Williams) was confronted with. In particular, going in front of a legislative committee in his efforts to be granted the right to be a human.<br /><br />Now, while I can see some of the technological advancements as those projected in the movie as possibly coming true - I do not see how the overwhelming influence of religious fundamentalism would ever permit a positive result for our hapless android - irrespective of 'human rights'. The future may progress technologically, however human attitudes will never escape the ever-growing neolithic belief systems that plague us today.<br /><br />Jodie Foster's science fiction classic 'Contact' addressed certain religious aspects, so it's not too far-fetched to suggest the inclusion of these considerations. Perhaps they needed to be at least mentioned in Asimov's original work? I don't know - I've not read it. However if anything is going to prevent us from reaching a plateau of wisdom, (as eventually demonstrated by the legislative committee in Bicentennial Man) it's going to be these obsolete beliefs.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|At first I thought the island was going to lose some of its magic since we now know who the \\"others\\" are and found out a lot more about them during Season 3, but they really brought in so much more to keep you biting your nails. DO NOT judge this season by the first 4-5 episodes, you will regret it. Once it picks up and gets going, you will be taken for the journey of your life.    And if you're looking for the episodes, you can get them on ITunes for $1.99 each, they download right to your computer, great quality too.    Greatest show ever made, and I don't say that as a fan boy, this is truly a masterpiece of television.
B00008O89K|5.0|This is truly, without a doubt, the best movie soundtrack of all time.  Even the mighty John Williams with the Star Wars franchise music cannot compete with its magnificence.  Poledouris accomplished something few ever could-creating an engrossing soundtrack that literally carries an entire film on its shoulders.  There is little dialogue in the movie, and it relies heavily on cinematography, music and visual exposition to advance the story.  From what I have read about the music, the producers of the film argued for a more modern, synthesizer-oriented sound, but Milius finally won out and a classical soundtrack was drafted.  This would have been an unmitigated disaster; the film would have failed miserably if synth was used in place of real music.  The sound itself ranges greatly in terms of emotional content, from a rousing, thunderous title sequence to tender love themes to sheer brutal combat and even some playfulness and mischief.  Unfortunately, the golden age of films is long gone and I doubt that anything even close to this will ever be composed again-the passion of this recording rivals not only other film soundtracks, but all classical and opera music ever written.  Kudos to the musicians as well, as this could not have been accomplished without their stunning performances.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Really enjoyed it. A great movie good for kids of all ages. also really enjoyed the little shorts offered on the DVD. Mater and the ghostlight is great!
B00005JLKN|4.0|This film is a remake of Manhunter (1986).  It is the first in the Hannibal Lector series.  Lector is played by Anthony Hopkins, so right away you come to realize that this should be a good remake.  This movie does not disappoint you on that end. The story line was the exact same as Manhunter, no changes.  The screenplay, however, was a better adaptation, so many of my questions about Lector were answered whereas Manhunter left me \\"hanging\\".  Hannibal is in jail and helps the FBI agent Will Graham (Edward Norton)---who he nearly killed and eaten a few years before--- catch a new serial killer, \\"The Tooth Fairy\\".  This time \\"The Tooth Fairy\\" is played by Ralph Fiennes.  I have to admit I liked Tom Noonan's \\"Tooth Fairy\\" better.  Overall this remake of Manhunter, in my opinion, is superior, except for the portrayal of \\"The Tooth Fairy\\".  Also since the time line happens before \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", more could have been done to make Hopkins look younger.  Overall an excellent and entertaining film!  Please watch this before you watch Silence of the Lambs, and enjoy!
B000O77SOK|5.0|It is great to see that this show has finally found it's way to DVD. Anyone who is interested in law and enjoys action ad suspense combined with a little romance should see this. I only hope that the entire series will be published and they don't quit in the middle. As far as the design of the menu is concerned the only thing missing in my oppinion is a play all function.
0800141660|5.0|The liberties this movie takes with the book are numerous, Hugh Grant is too charming & too good looking to portray Edward, Emma Thompson is way too old to be Elinor, it omits the scene with a contrite Willoughby...I could go on & on, yet the film works.  I think it captures much of the spirit of Austen's book, if not exactly faithful to her words.  I think the one thing the movie perhaps cannot convey or which falls a bit short is the Lucy Steele/Edward connection.  In the book, it is quite obvious that Lucy is only interested in Edward for his position and money.  Hugh Grant plays a charming, handsome, likable Edward whom Lucy might really have loved.  A large part of Elinor's story is missed by downplaying Lucy & her awareness of Elinor as a rival.  I missed that aspect.  However, Thompson's screenplay is engaging & funny and sweet and though I typically despise adaptations of my favorite books, I loved this movie and bought the DVD.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I absolutely love the story of Jane Eyre, and, like most movie adaptations, I was wary to see this film.  AMAZING.  Everything was exactly the way I had pictured it...the movie was long enough to capture the themes of the novel while making them believable to the viewer.  The casting was perfect...the acting was so good...it drew me emotionally to the movie just like the book did.  The story line was pretty much in accordance with the novel....I will be sharing this with everyone I know![[ASIN:B000LPQ6DE Jane Eyre (Masterpiece Theatre, 2006)]]
B000002UC5|3.0|As the greatest band in the world splintered into four pieces, the \\"cute poppy\\" piece of that band fell into a depression, grew a beard, retreated to his farm and took aid and comfort in his new bride and family.   As Paul struggled for a new direction in a new decade, he penned songs that showcased the true heart of a man that rarely revealed such things; while the lyrics remained straight-forward Macca fare, with only hints of what the man really felt peaking through, the music itself is stark, bare, unfinished melodies that drift by with an underlying current of moody self-doubt that exposes more than Paul probably intended of his true state of mind.  Some of the songs work (\\"Every Night\\", \\"Junk\\", and of course, the classic \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\", which could have sat quite comfortably next to anything on LET IT BE). Unfortunately, though, much of the album falls short. Still, the shoulder-shrugging verve McCartney displayed by actually releasing this unpolished album gives it a certain charm, and stands against the overrated first solo outing by fellow ex-Beatle/songwriting partner John Lennon as the better of the two.  It's an uneven, fractured album from a fractured artist who was just \\"a lonely man in the middle of something\\" that he couldn't understand... And this was his musical testament to that period in his life.
B00005JPRF|3.0|Since the last \\"Resident Evil\\" movie, the zombie-making virus has spread across the entire planet.  The world is a wasteland, but the Umbrella Corporation still exists underground.  Alice (Jovovich) teams up with a group of survivors, led by Claire (Larter), who are heading to Alaska.  Rumor has it that the infection hasn't reached there yet.  Soon, the Umbrella Corporation is targeting Alice and messing up the group's plans.<br /><br />\\"Resident Evil 3\\" is better than \\"2\\", but not as good as the original.  This time around, things seem more tame, with less blood and gore.  That will upset some die hard fans.  There is plenty of action though.  Milla Jovovich seems to be enjoying herself as alice, and although she has said that this is the last film in the series, the ending opens up infinite possible sequels.  This film is for fans of the series only.
0385512058|5.0|The advice presented in this book is quite simple and nothing is really new. Don't expect any advice based on the academic writing on social networks. Still I liked the style of writing and good practical examples. The key problem is naturally to implement the author's advice. He has for instance great advice on dinner parties, but the key difficulty is to get moving and doing it. In this regard, a book cannot really do much. Still, this book makes it as easy as possible.
0790729725|5.0|If you like a good \\"Mafia-slaughtering-everybody-film,\\" then you'll discover that this is the very best one ever made to date. I seriously doubt that Hollywood will ever yield a better one.<br /><br />The story is one of the Mafia glitz and how they were, to a man, ruthless murderers that we love to glorify because they got to do all the stuff we couldn't afford to do, either financially or legally. Only the best for these guys. The setting is the 50s, 60s, and early 70s.<br /><br />The top character is played by Joe Pesci, who loves to shoot and stab any fool who gives him the slightest bit of verbal guff. He's a diminutive figure who is out to prove that a hunting knife and a .357 Magnum manifest all the equalizer he needs to become a \\"Made Man\\".<br /><br />So this pack of Mafia scoundrels steal from, hijack, rob, and assault all whom are unfortunate enough to enter the circle of their realm and this even includes a number of their own brotherhood when the FBI begins to turn up the heat, generating an insider snitch here and there. The old conflict about some mafia members not wanting to enter the dope business also raises the stakes.<br /><br />This is a violent and graphic film in terms of language, murder, and darn near everything else.... and I loved it all. The soundtrack is equally incredible. Political correctness be damned!
B00004RFFS|3.0|Let's get this straight. Vampires aren't afraid of garlic?  Aren't killed by wooden stakes? Can just be killed by slicing them in half? Cry, and feel bad about being vampires? Don't recognize the famous Count? Don't need their own home soil to sleep in? Actually, straight isn't the word for this version. Perhaps it was a fatal disadvantage not having heard of Anne Rice before slipping this disc in the slot, but I was puzzled. Presumably because I didn't know what to expect, and am not into the vampire culture of today.  It seemed to me, though, that there were one or two interesting angles: like Hollywood is Vampire Town, not Tinsel Town. The plot, what I understood of it, was certainly very state-of-the-art modern. I'm not going to go into all the allegorical buddy-type psychology, which was all hanging well out anyway. Wishing again for Cushing and Lee dates me, I know, but they've spoiled me for any other vampire story, and I simply can't buy any of the updates and/or revisions. It made me think, now and then, but it also dragged; and I agree with those reviewers who thought Brad was just too pathetic and glum to make it work as entertainment. Great C18th scenery, costumes and so forth. Too serious, too deep, though. I've probably given it one star too many.
B00005JSGK|5.0|Well, a LOT of people would argue with my heading on this one and they'd probably be right -- but it's MY favorite John Wayne film. *.*<br /><br />Here, a (non-cowboy) John Wayne earns his living in Africa rounding up wild critters (often at the risk of human life) for zoos. The film is all about the close-knit team who carries out this now-dubious endeavor. A beautiful lady photographer throws a monkey wrench into the works when Wayne is forced to take her along during his expeditions.<br /><br />What do I love about the film?<br /><br />The cinematography is simply incredible... none of the wild animal footage looks at all hokey like it does in so many other African-adventure films. The color saturation is just great and the scenery is spectacular.<br /><br />The movie is bulging with cool old vehicles and other nostalgic impedimenta that one loves to see in this genre.<br /><br />My favorite aspect of this flick is the filmscore, composed and rendered by whom? Henry Mancini, the old Master. Most of the background music is contemporary to the early 60s themes that one might hear from Alex North (\\"Cleopatra\\") or from Les Baxter (\\"Voodoo Island\\"). Wonderful stuff!<br /><br />The casting is near-perfect and I suppose they had to include Red Buttons in this one, who plays a character named \\"Pockets\\" -- to me, he's the one hokey facet of the production although I cannot argue that many folks love him in this, and many other movies as well.<br /><br />In any event, Hatari is one of my top films (see my listmania lists for movies) and it gets my highest recommendation.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|I had seen previews to this movie a while back and couldn't wait to see it. This movie is good but at the same time can be confuseing if you miss any part of it.
B000LPS47U|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of contemporary horror but I watched this one a few years back and I really enjoyed it -- to the degree that I've viewed it multiple times since.<br /><br />It's a tongue-in-cheek Frankenstein ripoff, but not really hokey at all. And, it's actually scary at certain moments of suspense. This film is well-done.<br /><br />If you're not much of a horror film fan but would enjoy watching such a movie once in awhile, this would be a great one for you. But Cat Lovers beware -- Old Puss (the stuffed cat) gets some really abusive treatment during the young doctor's experiments!<br /><br />This one's a hoot!
B000R7HY0K|1.0|OK, I really wanted this to be a great flick. I'm sure the director thinks it is. Man is he off base.  Sometimes Terrintino's style, such as the diner conversation where Vincent is describing McDonald's, the Metric system, and Mayo on fries, is entertaining.  These little diversions, the director attempting to show off what he considers to be a creative style, are cute once and a while.  Like adding some salt to a Celery stick. Makes it real tasty. Or adding Mayo to fries. Death Proof? He dipped the celery in a salt bath, used it as a salt scoop,  piled on more salt, and kept on going.  I'd rather force down that briny treat than watch this waste of photons.<br /><br />Picture that quite entertaining dinette table banter.  Now make an entire movie like that. Throw in 2 minutes of action every 20 minutes. Stick a fun chase scent at the end. Then add a real pathetic ending.  Look, I saw plenty of \\"grind house\\" flicks. The film quality was never as bad as is faked in this POS - and the audio was much worse!<br /><br />Save your money.  Planet Terror was better, and at least kept me entertained.  Using my >> index - how many times and how often I pressed the >> button on my DVD player, this ranked at over 45 >> presses.  That is pathetic.<br /><br />I was just hoping that EVERY character in this movie would die as soon as possible and put me out of my misery.
0783225849|5.0|Few horror films can stack up to this one -- it's a masterpiece of the genre.<br /><br />An attractive secretary pulls off a bit of embezzlement from her employer and heads for the hills. But not being a professional crook, her paranoia really begins to weigh on her (typical Hitchcock suspense) as she tries to skip town with the loot and, as she thinks she's being followed by a mysterious man.<br /><br />Ultimately she ends up out in the boondocks at the tiny and nearly defunct Bates Motel where she meets the soft-spoken proprietor, Norman Bates, who seems to befriend her and set her mind at ease a bit with his friendly manner.<br /><br />But, as this flashy little number takes her shower for the evening (really a vulnerable moment!), she gets to meet Norman's MOTHER (who lives in the creepy old 3-story behind the motel with her son, sort of), a French-knife weilding, nasty, hussy-hating stabber.... and she isn't going to tolerate her Norman's purity being soiled with the likes of an urban strumpett!<br /><br />I'll stop there to avoid \\"the spoiler\\" but, leave it to say, Hitchcock keeps us on the edge of our seats to the very end. This film is as good today as it was when it was released. Really creepy!!!
0743298020|5.0|This opening sentence from the editorial view \\"Settle down to enjoy a rousing good ghost story with Diane Setterfield's debut novel\\" is made by a moron.  This book is intriguing and exceptionally well written, but what it is NOT is a rousing good ghost story.
0783240236|5.0|I'll open by saying that Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedron were perfect casting choices for this film. Hitchcock also hit a grand slam with the story, which tenons perfectly with the location, Bodega Bay (Northern California Coastal village).<br /><br />The story is this: Rod Taylor (a successful playboy-type) gets the hots for Tippi Hedron whom he runs across in a pet store. Why is a playboy-type in a pet store? To buy a pet-gift for his early-teen baby sister, but he strikes out on the gift. Anyway, Tippi is sorta hot for Rod as well and she's the adventuresome type -- so, she buys a pair of lovebirds, (the perfect gift for a young teen!), finds out that Taylor lives up the coast at Bodega Bay with his widowed mother on the weekends, and proceeds to beat him home with the surprise.<br /><br />After arriving in the village, Tippi rents a boat, crosses the lake to Rod's farm estate, and drops off the birds where he'll see them as he walks into the house, which happens right away. But as she retreats across the lake (playing hard-to-get!) in the boat, a seagull coshes her in the head in a deliberate surprise attack. Rod races around the lake in his cool, (well, it's cool NOW anyway), car and retrieves her from the boat, steering her to a nearby tavern-diner for some first aide and, additionally, some intimate conversation. The place is packed with crusty characters and curmudgeonly residents.<br /><br />Tippi is noticed right off by the locals and sort of despised right away for all her city good looks, and, since she's made such a frivolous fuss. But Tippi hangs in there, deciding to spend the weekend in the village. She boards at the local school marm's house (another looker and former lover of Taylor who's bulging with great advice about the old boy), and it all goes downhill from there.<br /><br />The school kids are subsequently attacked by hordes of squalling birds of all species. Many screaming residents retreat back to the tavern and, through a comedy of errors, there is suddenly an explosion at the local gas station and the entire town is thus set ablaze! The combination of the out-of-control fire and the monumental bird attack creates chaos on an unprecedented scale -- this is Bodega Bay's 9-11, to be a bit anachronistic.<br /><br />Again, the locals give Tippi the old evil eye so Rod sweeps her up and carts her home where the ornithological situation deteriorates even further. A neighbor is killed (eyes all poked out and eaten away!) by the feathered assailants and the burden falls solely upon Rod to save his mother, his sister, and Tippi from the flying nemeses.<br /><br />The camera angles, the cinematography in general, and the nostalgic details of Bodega Bay all contribute to make this masterpiece of horror films one of the best of all time.<br /><br />I give this one my very highest rating and recommend it to all.the local gas station and the entire town is thus set ablaze!

0380789035|3.0|Being a very large appreciator of the sandman series, this book didn't seem to deliver for me.  Perhaps if I wasn't familiar with Neil's work in the past, this book would seem even better to me.  To me the dialogue and storyline seemed to be pretty interesting, but the descriptive character of the book seemed to be seriously lacking. I suppose this could be attributed to the fact the author has so much past experience in telling stories together with imagery and artwork.  Also there were some  elements like the names of the old gods and the protagonists that made me lose some respect for the work - to me the name \\"Shadow\\" is not a credible name for a character in a work of respectable fiction.  Neil never did anything like that in his Sandman series - he is much better than genre scifi/fantasy, though this book fits too close to that description for me.  In that series there was a beauty and refinement that is lacking here in this work.  Some of these drawbacks make me even think that maybe it wasn't Neil writing it anyway, but some ghostwriter, or perhaps it was produced through a workshop like a Steven King novel.  Anyway, I still have great respect for this author.  Perhaps I will see things about this book in another light later.

Lo and behold - I've missed Freddie Mercury for years and there just was no one better - Queen ruled for so many years before his death.  Mika seems to be the reincarnation of Freddie himself!  In a time when so many groups sing other people's songs and don't play their own music much less write it I always appreciate a band that does it all.  Viva la Mika!  I'm going to be playing this CD as much as I've been playing Plain White T's!  The music and vocals are compelling and perk up a bad day any day of the week!

OK, so I chose to buy the latter and am now a bit disappointed to discover that the total time of both CDs, combined, is 64:06.

Then the Igbos secede, and a civil war starts.<br /><br />More importantly, it gives one an insight into the suffering, pain, heartache, endured by the Biafrans (the short lived secessionist nation), the scheming of the west, as well as the blissful ignorance of most other Nigerians of the carnage going on in the eastern part of the nation, all this done without pointing any fingers or judging.<br /><br />This book, though fiction (the characters), is an important chronicle of a part of Nigerian history that should never be forgotten, and left me deeply moved. A literary classic!!

Visionary companies, in contrast, embrace the power of \\"and:\\" You preserve the core AND stimulate progress.<br /><br />The authors then methodically, step-by-step proceed to explain how great companies erect structures that embrace these seemingly contradictory goals. The great companies the authors studied, contrary to conventional wisdom, are not profit focused at their core but rather, they are `value' focused. These values are a sort of nucleus, around which leaders in visionary companies grow the company. This was the case in such great companies as Disney, Wal-Mart, Merck, Ford, Hewlett Packard, 3M, Johnson and Johnson and others.<br /><br />Among the core myths that Collins and Porras shattered are that visionary companies must start with a great product and be pushed into the future by charismatic leaders. Instead the great visionary companies they studied were characterized by total lack of an initial business plan or key idea and by remarkably self-effacing leaders. The authors are much more impressed with the great companies' almost cult-like devotion to a \\"core ideology\\" or identity, and active indoctrination of employees into \\"ideological commitment\\" to the company.<br /><br />The book is interesting to read, is humorous, is among the best, easiest to follow guide to strategic management. The book also provides guidelines to help managers at all levels to apply the concepts. It is well written with compelling case studies. I highly recommend the book to those looking for a practical down-to-earth book that is readable and useful.ble and useful.

B000EMGA3U|5.0|Sonic Youth's debut holds a special place in my heart, in my ear and in my collection. If only one band could be named for bringing avante garde music of the 20th century into the mainstream, it is them. One aspect of my enjoyment of their debut, is a certain austerity of this recording. The lyrics are sparse and come off more as poems, collaborating with a No Wave rhythm section and musique concrete guitars. I recently revisited my Iannis Zenakis collection and was pleased to discover a number of similarities between his 1960 composition \\"Orient-Occident\\" and several elements of early Sonic Youth. From \\"She Is Not Alone\\" to \\"Freezer Burn,\\" any fan of SYR would immediately recognize elements of what they brought out of the shadows and have allowed us to digest and enjoy. Thanks SYR.
B000U7VTCG|5.0|I don't give many excellent reviews but this recording deserves it. Good band and lead singer with well written, creative songs.
B000002J2F|5.0|Others on this page have done a spectacular job of telling the whole Duke story, so I won't try to duplicate their efforts. I just want to chime in as a music lover, a music composition major in college, and a long time fan of this album.    Duke is infinitely inspiring to me. With the exception of \\"Misunderstanding\\", an elegantly simple but welcome intermission in this grandiose theater piece, every track climbs upon the shoulders of the previous track, creating an emotionally and intellectually challenging musical narrative that never stops unfolding--never stops entertaining. Themes are created, developed and recapitulated. Bold and soaring melodic statements are anchored by lyrics reflecting very human vulnerabilities. A consistent, bright, and vibrant sound throughout underscores its place as a complete work, as opposed to a collection of disparate songs--it begs to be heard in one go, from front to back.    Duke is grand, without being pretentious, and after countless listens over the last 20 years, I continue to be enthralled by it.

B000VKJ6VS|5.0|I heard \\"Rise Today\\" on the local radio station and thought, great song!...who is that?  So I called the station and they said Alterbridge.  I went home, and ordered Blackbird from Amazon....after a few listens...it is a solid record.      Nice to hear a \\"new\\" band who writes good songs and actually plays good straight-ahead-power-ROCK-and-ROLL ....NICE JOB Alterbridge.

B000V8I2QU|5.0|Not many albums take me back to my days growing up in Pittsburgh but on first listen of Magic I was transported to the auditorium of Clarion College in PA where I first saw the E Street Band live for probably one of my greatest concerts.      There is not a bad song on the album and almost all of them are some of the best he's written.  Radio Nowhere is one of those songs I will never get tired of hearing.  Girls in Their Summer Clothes and Your Own Worst Enemy takes me right into the bars and towns I remember in PA and NJ. Gypsy Biker took me to my first listen of Darkness on the Edge of Town.  What a tremendous effort!    I believe there are a few rock stars left who value what they write more than their monetary success.  I put Bruce on the top of the list with Neil Young and Dylan.  What a songwriter and what an album!

B00003CXDV|5.0|I saw this in the theater when first released.  I never laughed so hard and so long!  While I grew up on StarTrek, which was before my daughter's time, she laughed histerically too.  It is my favorite pick-me-up.
B000002JEV|5.0|Undoubtedly Led Zeppelin's best Blues-influenced Cd as it includes their rawest live versions of numerous Blues classics, such as \\"You Shook Me,\\" \\"I Can't Quit You Baby,\\" and \\"How Many More Times,\\" which were written or influenced by great Blues artists such as Willie Dixon, J. B. Lenoir, Otis Rush, Muddy Waters, Albert King, and Howlin Wolf.  The set also includes an exquisite live version of my favorite Zep Blues tune: \\"Since I've Been Loving You.\\" I believe Led Zep IV hadn't been released yet, so when Robert Plant announces \\"Stairway to Heaven,\\" he only gets some polite applause which is very ironic.  It may be the first live recording of that masterpiece. You also get two live versions of \\"Dazed & Confused\\" and \\"Whole Lotta Love.\\"  That's a whole lotta awesome.  I can't think of any band that could perform a song in so many different ways, yet each one feverishly impassioned, and this Cd is testimony to that.  Each member is at the top of his game on this Cd as shown by Plant's vocal power, Page's blistering guitarwork, etc.  Not to be missed for hard-core Led Zeppelin fans.
0385340559|1.0|This was my first (and last) Jack Reacher story. The guy is an arrested adolescent, with 1960's ideas about living a life unencumbered by possessions, taking idiotic chances in implausible situations. He leads a  band of cohorts who are said to be the best and brightest, but who show total devotion to their leader, the dimmest of losers.<br /><br />The narrative is divided into short chapters, each meant to leave the reader panting to find out what happens next. What does happen next is another tedious description of Los Angeles traffic and highways: much of it has all the excitement of your car's GPS guidance system.<br /><br />When we get to the action parts, we descend to cartoon adventure. For example, a secure, fortress-like installation is built with fences low enough and close enough that the hero can assault it with homemade Molotov cocktails.<br /><br />This is the sort of book we end up reading while waiting for Nelson DeMille to produce more of the real thing.
0061547832|5.0|This was a great motivational book full of insight from one of the best. It's really annoying how people can't appreciate another mans success such as Donald Trump. It's just my opinion that when a man worth billions of dollars writes a fantastic book on how he got there and gives you tips along the way to help you become successful, you take his advice. It's a must read!
0316067598|5.0|I learned of this book through discussions with fellow Naval Academy graduates at a reunion of former Navy football players. The book was of special interest because Navy SEAL Lcdr. Eric Kristensen was the son of one of our teammates, Adm. Ed Kristensen USN Ret.(USNA '65). The up front and personal account of this military action gives the reader an insight into what Navy SEALs go through and the kinds of things they have been doing for about forty years in combat all over the world.Why they do it is also made clear. These four SEALs made a decission on the Afghanistan mountainside that most decent human beings would have made, but it cost the lives of three of them and many more who came to rescue them. Their thought process in arriving at this fatal decission is very intriguing. The word \\"hero\\" gets thrown around loosely today. If you want to get a better definition of \\"hero\\" fixed in your mind you must read this book.
B0001WTVUW|3.0|This movie was interesting to watch.  The special effects are dated when compared to today's CGI for movies .  The film contains some stock footage of nuclear testing.  The plot is good, and there are a lot of actors/actresses in the movie who are still performing today.  Overall, it is still a relevant film and shows possible scenarios after a nuclear attack.
0375836675|3.0|Wow, was this book a surprise. After about one hundred pages, I was done - I hated that the main character couldn't take more action, do something with his life, bathe his disgusting dog. But then these incredible, strange, emotionally significant \\"missions\\" start happening, and I felt drawn into caring about him and the people he encountered in a surprisingly profound way. I'm not sure which group of young people will remain interested in this sad sack long enough to get to the truly inspiring, change-your-life qualities he takes on later in the novel, but I would recommend it anyway.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|During the 90's Disney flicks were lame, drippy musicals. This is not the case with Mary Poppins. The songs are still fresh and vibrant. As a whole this is the most re-watchable musical flick ever, so I'm happy to have it in DVD. Highly recommended to adults, even those that were put off Disney by \\"The Little Mermaid\\" and the rest of the Eisner era dreck-to-theater.<br /><br />However, I have to admit that from a technical point of view, Mary Poppins shows its age. The blend between humans and cartoons is not that good, so you have to try harder to keep your disbelief suspended.<br /><br />Anyway, it has great nostalgic value for me. Perhaps kids might like it, too... I'll show it to my little nephews and tell you later.
0060194995|5.0|This is at least the third time I have read this book, and I loved it even more than the other two times.  Whole passages are burned into my brain.  This time when I read it I could see Gregory Peck as Atticus in my head...an added plus.

B000TSIK14|5.0|This band has been putting out albums since the early 70s ,and this latest release is among one of thier best works since \\"love at first sting\\"
B000089RV6|5.0|AC/DC mastered the fine art of direct, straightforward balls-to-the-wall rock and roll right from the start, and they have never let up since.  This album represents an important turning point in their career - a change of singers from Bonn Scott, who was probably one of the best rock vocalists ever, to Brian Johnson - definitely without a doubt the best rock vocalist ever.  This completed their sound in a way no one had ever dreamed possible, catapulting them to superhuman status.  The remastered CD is very clear and direct, and even cleaner, more in-your-face sounding than the original release.  A perfect preservation of a classic.
B000PHX8C0|4.0|THIS ALBUM IS TRULLY A PUNCH TO THE FACE. PURE METAL POWER AND AGGRESSION!<br />BUY IT!
B000URDEB0|4.0|More classical, more metal, lots of variety - Nightwish is delivering more of everything they delivered on their last album.  I definitely hear progress, some vocal and classical moments are really over-the-top.  All in all Nightwish goes toe-to-toe with the best of them (Sonata Arctica [[ASIN:B000OLHGFC Unia]] and Therion [[ASIN:B000KRN65E Gothic Kabbalah]] come to mind), and they're getting even better!

0374280967|4.0|The Bookschlepper recommends: Alan Bennett's gentle humor and obvious familiarity with Her Majesty provides us with a slim book postulating HM becoming a reader--an obsessed reader--and the ramifications upon the monarchy and the realm. Following it to its logical conclusion, the plot ends, not with a bang, but a whimper. One finds it delightful and amusing.
0767834739|4.0|The living dead once again won a spot in my DVD collection.  With new twists and altered characters, this movie pulls it off with a great cast.  The story line was in sync with its predicessor Resident Evil. The only thing i found rather unexciting was the canine attack in the school.  I found it dull in a typical way, and spoiled that portion of the movie for me.
B000002G8J|2.0|Compared to his greatest CD's incl. Slowhand and others, Backless is little more than a mistake. Its title refers to Clapton's description of Bob Dylan, that he had eyes in the back of his head, that he was in fact \\"Backless.\\" This CD is obviously under the influence of alcohol and God-knows-what-else and it shows. Only Golden Ring, again written for Pattie Boyd (ie \\"Layla\\") shows some heart. Skip this one for one of his greatest hits packages.
B000002H97|5.0|this is the most successful album metallica has ever put out. it is in fact still doin a phenomenal job. many call metallica \\"sell out\\" b/c of this album but you have to admit that this is good music. i cannot skip any second of this album. it's just simply brilliant. the words, the rythm, the guitar solos (props to kirk!!!!!!!), i can't possibly say enough. it's just amazing. which is why metallica is my favorite band of all time. i don't see 'em goin anywhere anytime soon. i just wish that they will put out another one just like this. buy this! it's worth the money
B0001WTUH6|5.0|For anyone who loves watching vampire movies, this one is awesome.  Combining a story about vampires and lycans (werewolves) was a great idea.  I say two thumbs up to the writer's.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|i love it when artists/bands go out of the ordinary and experiment new things that may seem a little risky at times. metallica did it and they proved that they're here to stay.    i got this DVD set about 3-4 years ago and it just never gets old. the guys did a magnificent job and michael was just wonderful. seeing two giants from two worlds different genres perform on the same stage was simply amazing. i mean they had so much to learn from each other and it's so great to see them enjoying themselves. it shows that heavy metal bands are not just about long hair, they have talent.
0143038583|5.0|If you don't know the history and significance of corn in the U.S., you need to read this book!  Very informative.
0385733577|2.0|I didn't hate this book and I will probably read the sequel since this book is not a complete book and ends in the middle of the story (continued, presumably in the sequel.) The problem is, however, that this book is not very good. In fact, it's pretty terrible. The book switches focus so many times that you never get any real sense of the characters so after hundreds of pages, you don't know anymore about the characters then you did at the start so it's very hard to care about them. This book has a very large cast of characters and, by the end, and they are a little more then cardboard cut outs. Perhaps the author could have tried developing a few characters instead of creating hundreds of bland people we never get a sense of? I can also hear my inner English teacher screaming \\"show me, don't tell me\\" as he insists on repeating everything over and over instead of just letting you infer yourself. The author is also so concerned with being \\"hip\\" that the pop culture references are so peppered as to be both annoying and distracting to the story. I appreciate that the author has a lot of knowledge about the mythology that he wants to showcase, but, with the exception of one battle scene towards the end that I enjoyed, the rest of the book is slow and, frankly, boring, like when the most boring teacher in school tries to be hip and it just falls flat. I also think that, as a reader, it was unfair to make the first book end with no resolution. Thus I am now forced to read a second lackluster book from this author just to see if the story that he was telling was worth it. There are millions of series in the world and others at least give some resolution at the end of each part, if not a resolution to the entire thing. As I said, I am willing to give him a second chance with the second book since, though boring and poorly written, I didn't hate this book, but, so far, this series isn't anything to get excited about.
B000FIHCTY|3.0|This is my first review. It's great when you can read these things, and be warned before spending your hard earned quan, only to be dissapointed. Everything about this release is awesome, the sound, the packaging...oh wait...whats this? There are only 12 tracks! Thats right...Radio Radio is missing!  Hope it wasn't your favorite tune on the disc, cuz ya won't hear it here. My copy is not a fake either, so while Im at it, beware of all Japan discs these days. Just because it's Japanese don't necessarily make it better, or even good. I recently bought Rod Stewart's Never A Dull Moment, the Japan mini LP remaster. It's pretty thin sounding and even distorted in some places, compared with the warmth of the $5 domestic reissue. I'm just sayin!
B000PTYPAC|5.0|Not only did the CD get here amazingly fast, but it was in perfect condition. It also helps that it is definitely my favorite album at the moment!
B00005JPRD|4.0|There have been several movies that have tried to make the music of The Beatles a central focus of their reason d'existence. Some - like The Beatles' own [[ASIN:B0000542D2 A Hard Day's Night]] and [[ASIN:B00000JRUQ Yellow Submarine]] - are perfect, some are not (the dismal \\"All This and World War Too\\"). Even the camp classic [[ASIN:B00009APB6 Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]] was so bad it was worth seeing because of the music. Heck, even the forgettable [[ASIN:B00005TT77 I Am Sam]] raked in a killer soundtrack thanks to John, Paul, George and Ringo.<br /><br />But they've got nothing on \\"Across The Universe.\\" Taking the turmoil and tumult of the sixties and re-imagining it through the lyrics of Beatle's songs, it is a trippy, hallucinogenic ride that is a visual and sonic feast. Jude (from Liverpool, naturally) comes to the US to find his American soldier dad (Robert Clohessy, a regular from [[ASIN:B00031TYBC Oz - The HBO prison drama]]) only to collide with rich kid renegade Max and then to fall for his sister, Lucy. Suddenly, they find themselves in NYC with a Janis Joplinish landlady, Sadie, and her Jimi Hendrixian boyfriend, Jojo.<br /><br />The sixties then take their turn into the war, and the drama unfolds as Jude falls for Lucy (\\"I've Just Seen a Face\\"), Max finds himself drafted (\\"I Want You\\") and Lucy falls under the spell of the anti-war movement leader. Each point is often brilliantly illustrated, and director Julie Taymor tosses subtlety out the window for several of the film's best sequences. In particular, when Prudence sings \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\" as a lament for a love that can't speak out loud, football players fly through the air and collide as she walks through them. When Max gets to his indoctrination and the exaggerated GI Joes march in \\"stomp dance\\" style to \\"I Want You,\\" it's breathtaking. While the narrative occasionally falters, the visuals and set pieces never do.<br /><br />Of course, there is the music. While there's nothing earth-shattering here, all the actors acquit themselves just fine. The small handful of cameos are great, especially Joe Cocker singing \\"Come Together\\" as three different characters, and Bono playing the Ken Keasey Electric Kool-Aid guru Dr Robert on the magic bus, promoting his new book titled (heh heh) \\"I Am The Walrus.\\" (I could have done without Eddie Izzard's \\"Being for The Benefit of Mr Kite,\\" even if the sequence is sufficiently madcap.) But this isn't a sloppy kaleidoscope like the [[ASIN:B0000067L8 Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band 1978 Soundtrack]] was; other than the three men mentioned prior, there are no stars here. In particular, Sadie (Dana Fuchs) and Jojo (Martin Luther McCoy) give dynamite performances, and other than Evan Rachel Wood, the cast is relatively unknown.<br /><br />I really can't say enough about the pleasure I got from \\"[[ASIN:B000WCBPOG Across The Universe]], and it may be the first time you walk into a theater humming the songs. I was skeptical at first, because many of the reviews I'd read were not kind. But I have a feeling many of them were written by folks of a more tender age, lacking the comprehension of the times portrayed on screen. One of the most fun things about this movie was catching the goofy Beatles' homages sprinkled in the film's dialog (favorite, when Prudence sneaks into the Sadie's communal apartment and someone asked where she comes from, Jude replies \\"she came in through the bathroom window\\").<br /><br />This is also a recommendable movie for one other reason. It isn't. When I say 'it isn't,' I mean, not a sequel, not a rip-off of a TV series (old or new), not a remake and some lowbrow teen sex-romp. There isn't anything cloying or coy, and while the movie is certainly political, the politics you get from it will be what you read out on your own. \\"Across The Universe\\" is as relevant today as it was when when The Beatles sang \\"But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao, you ain't gonna make it with anyoneanyhow.\\" Grab your popcorn, sit back, relax and float downstream.relax and float downstream.

B000WZAE1I|4.0|I recently saw this small gem of a movie and was completely enchanted.  It is a story that will entertain your children and grandchildren while keeping you completely captivated.  Based on a graphic novel by Neil Gaiman it tells the story of a young man who crosses into the realm of a magical land (as had his father before him) to retreive a fallen star and bring it back to the woman of his dreams.  Upon finding  the star (Clare Danes) he attempts to return home with his prize.  And so the adventure begins.......... as they are pursued by an evil witch (played with relish and devilish glee by Michelle Pfeiffer),  and are befriended by a flamboyent lightening bolt chasing pirate (Robert DeNiro) who could easily fill in for one of the \\"Fab Five\\" on Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.<br /><br />In addition, this film is filled to the brim with wonderful cameo performances by Peter O'Toole (as the King), Rupert Everett (as one of the Kings evil sons), Sienna Miller (as the spoiled girlfriend), and Ricky Gervais (as Freddy the Fence). Although reminiscent in some ways of The Princess Bride, this movie possesses  more humor and charm as well as visually stunning special effects and an impressive use of make-up and prosthetic devices.<br /><br />Stardust emerges as a welcome and refreshing change from the the plethora of sequels and animated films that have been clogging the big screen recently.  For a pleasant two hour romp through a fun filled fantasy world, put Stardust on your list of must see movies.
B000001FDK|4.0|Grease is one of my all time favorite movies and I remember having this on an eight track tape and wanted it back in my collection.  Even my 15 year old daughter loves it, she downloaded some of the songs on her IPOD.
1569242739|5.0|I've made so many cupcakes from this book.  It's a great book, the only complaint I have is that they use mostly all-purpose flour in their recipes, which is not a whole grain and low in nutritional value.  I normally sub at least half quinoa flour or whole wheat pastry and the results are still good.    Also specifically, the carrot-cake cupcake recipe is jacked!  Do a search online and you'll see some photos of sunken cupcakes that are way too moist/oily.  The ratio of spices also needs to be doubled.  But with a little tweaking (use of a little less oil & more whole wheat pastry flour), I was able to fix the recipe & it's one of our favorite snacks!  I've even used the revised recipe to make a full carrot cake.  This book is great for vegan bakers.  Hopefully they'll come out with another book that uses more whole grains.
0143038419|2.0|I enjoyed parts of this book but not the book as a whole. I did not have a problem with finding her self centered or self indulgent, as many other reviewers here did. I admired the bravery of the writer and thought her adventure was great, It's just that many parts of this book were sooooo slow, I did not expect the book to be largely focused on her religious beliefs. I would not pass this book on to a friend, not memorable for me ...
B000W01G3I|5.0|(Released 10.16.07) I had to hunt around for a copy of this on its release date but it was well worth it. It includes the original footage with additional camera angles and some documentaries which are also included. Also an added bonus is footage from Chelmsford from February of 1967. The newly released CD doesn't really add anything new but this DVD has enough bonus material to make it worthwhile.

This has become one of my favorite movies.  I loved, loved, loved the story line about the older gentleman and Kate's character and the twist the movie took with Jude Law and Cameron Diaz.      This movie was a warm, well-crafted, funny, touching, and completely unexpected joy.  This is not your everyday romance movie!  Hey, I even liked Cameron by the end of it which is a miracle!  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who's tired of the same-old movie from Hollywood.    Bravo!

B000K15VSA|5.0|This Final Cut is so worthwhile. Its the real directors's cut. The previous \\"Director's Cut\\" from a few years back was just a workprint they rediscovered. Ridley Scott has tightened everything up and restored scenes. The wide city shots from above are breathtaking. The score has been sweetened using the most up to date equipment and made to engulf you in the atmospher. The movie flows so well, makes so much more sense.     SPOILER ALERT:  It is so clear that Deckard is conceived a replicant from the get-go, just like the book its based on. This fact puts every scene in context and clearly shows that Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) is the real hero of the film.     I saw the movie two times this month (Oct. 2007) digitally projected at the LA Landmark Theater and it was stunning and flowed beautifully. And the ending is so right on now. With Deckard realizing at the end he is a replicant, they really capture a great deal of what Philip K. Dick was exploring in his original novel.
B000099T3P|4.0|Critters is one of those rare crossover movies that's just as entertaining and fun for the adults as it is for it's targeted younger audience (PG-13).  Think Monster Squad, The Gate, or House and you get a pretty good idea at how the movie is structured with enough of an edge to get some actual tension and jumps out of you without having to develop into a terrifying bloodbath.  The story revolves around alien creatures (think 80's toy Popples with big teeth) who end up on earth with an insatiable appetite and ready to eat anything and everything in sight.  Horror vet Dee Wallace Stone (The Howling, Cujo, Halloween remake) heads up a cast of likeable and believable characters trying to find a way to survive and repel the invasion.  The \\"Critters\\" themselves are charming and funny while still being vicious and threatening and steal the screen everytime they show up.  This is more like a 3.5 star movie (for what it is) but is worth rounding up do to tha ability to enjoy it with your kids (especially around Halloween).  Steer clear of the lousy sequels that were cranked out after this movies success.

B000H5V8DG|5.0|I think 'Alias' was the best TV spy series ever made and with 'Alias-the Complete Collection' I get to watch it as often as I want to.  All the extras make this collection a must have for Alias fans.  The Rambaldi box is a great was to store them and there is a great little booklet that answers a lot of questions that viewers had; like was that really Sydney on page 47?  There is a hidden compartment in the bottom of the box with  another special DVD.  My only complaint about Alias was it only ran for five years; but at least it was the best five years of television.
0618918248|2.0|Mr. Dawkins is a distinguished scientist, a man of reason. Perhaps he would achieve more good if he tried just to close the doors on bigoted religious beliefs instead of trying, out of what I can only construe as being a degree of spiritual blindness or ignorance, to slam the door shut on religion as such. Unfortunately, Mr. Dawkins' reasoning, while rightly attempting to close the door on bigoted religious beliefs fails to open any doors to the many paths of spiritual enlightenment. It seems to me that Mr. Dawkins somehow manages to be just as narrow-minded, bigoted and dishonest in his reasoning as the people he criticizes for such behaviour. Being so intent on having scientific proof and to consider only evidence based on facts, how do you expect to get away with peppering a text with such sayings as \\"...for good people to do evil things, it takes religion\\" or \\"Politics has slain thousands but religion has slain its tens of thousands\\" without supplying a scrap of evidence to substantiate such claims? To quote Mr. Dawkins: \\"Nevertheless, I am irresistibly reminded of Peter Medawar's comment on Father Teilhard de Chardin's The Phenomenon of Man, in the course of what is possibly the greatest negative book review of all time: `it's author can be excused of dishonesty only on the grounds that before deceiving others he has taken great pains to deceive himself'\\". I am irresistibly tempted to believe that perhaps we should also excuse Mr. Dawkins of dishonesty on the same grounds.
B000ULQV0W|2.0|There's really nothing on this album that reaches out and grabs you. Maybe the exception is Hard Sun but that's about it. The music is good. The vocals are good. The lyrics are good. It just leaves you flat. I know it's a soundtrack, but it's just not an album I want to listen to over and over again. I love Pearl Jam. Love Eddie Vedder. I don't love this.
0316010669|5.0|Great read that explains in detail a phenomenon that most of us encounter on a daily basis - thin slicing - making split decisions based on limited or no analysis. The book has numerous practical applications and should be read by anyone in a decision making role - executives, marketers, traders, etc.  Definitely liked Blink more than Tipping Point.  Looking forward to Gladwell's next book.
B00080ZG10|1.0|I love this movie and I was looking forward to owning it.  But the dvd was so messed up it hardly plays.  Now how does a brand new dvd get all scratched up like the copy I recieved?  This is the first of many products I have purchased through that I am not happy with.

B000MQC9H4|3.0|If, like me, you have been under pressure to rent/buy something \\"we'll both like\\" (ie her) - then try this. This won't change your world but it's watchable (thus you're spending time together, right?).Male bashing is actually very limited, there are no annoying gay or other oppressed minority characters (yep, none - unbelievable right?)and also little political preaching. Little man Jack Black is slightly bizarre as a romantic lead, but you get used to it. Cam Diaz looks good with short hair, although she is starting to show her age a bit (which actually makes her character's actions quite believable)....
B000T2PRF2|3.0|This Cd is a very nice collectors item for Diana Krall fans. Some unexpected clips on the DVD and a decent 'best off' series of songs on the CD.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|This was a film that exposed so much to me that I never knew.  There aren't two sides to this story.  There are no bi-partisan issues.  This is a movie about how bad the government has messed up and left their citizens for dead... literally.  Moore delivers a fantastic movie and leaves us questioning our own security after we have learned just how cruel we can be to one another.

0143038419|4.0|Although Liz Gilbert by the end of this book seems a little self absorbed (the why me after a divorce gets old - I mean, 1,000's of people get divorced every year) she is still very likeable, humble, open minded  and forgiving - esp. of herself.  Not everyone will be able to relate to this book (young unmarried men probably) but anyone who has gone through a search of self discovery (after a break up) can probably find something here.  Liz writes with a lot of humor as well which really helps the book to breeze by.
1881273156|5.0|Gary Chapman's book is very insightful. Not only do you learn your partner's \\"love language,\\" but you'll understand yourself and others better, too. If you wish to convey appreciation and love to your spouse, family and friends, this book definitely provides effective measures for doing so.
B0002TKFRM|3.0|Sorry for not being a sound engineer, but unlike previous reviewers I would like to talk about the performance only. This is one of the best played and recorded Pictures at an Exhibition, OK, but also one of the most uninvolving ever: what I hear here is mere virtuosity! Reiner conducts all the work in the same comfortable, perfect and uncommitted manner, and does not seem to realize at any time that these pictures, well, are supposed to depict something! These are not abstract paintings, yet Reiner goes through the whole of it like one who does not understand anything to art.     The other works are a totally different matter though, and that is why I would still recommend this CD - Mussorgsky's Night on the Bald Mountain in particular is one of the most terrifying ever, full of glaring lightning. The disc will also give you the opportunity to discover Kabalevsky's overture to Colas Breugnon (Toscanini also recorded it and it was part of his 1990s 72-volume edition on RCA - if you manage to find it...).     But as far as the Pictures are concerned, there are many other much more compelling performances which really make the pictures spring to life! It must be said that this work conveys so many different atmospheres that all conductors and pianists are convincing in some of them... and less inspired in other ones (one could write an article about which recording to recommend for every single picture!). Try Ormandy on RCA (his Gnomus is incredibly sinister and unsettling), Karajan's last recording with the BPO in the 80s (DG), who is very impressive throughout but particularly outstanding in Il Vecchio Castello, and from Catacombs to the Great Gate of Kiev (as imposing as Boris Godunov!), Muti on EMI... or Toscanini.     This Reiner CD is best to be recommended for its other-than-Pictures second half!
B000TLMWMY|5.0|I first saw this broadcast on public TV.  They were asking a lot of money for the DVD.  When I found it on Amazon I was extremely happy with the price so I bought 3.  One for me and two Christmas presents.  I'm no fan of contemporary Country music but I was around 9 years old when the JC show originally aired and I've always wanted to get my hands on something like this.  For me, guys like Johnny, Waylon, George Jones and gals like Tammy Wynette, Linda Ronstadt were simply great.  of course Johnny Cash is in a class of his own.  The performances on the set are truly great and the audio and video quality is superb.  Plus all of the non-country guests are really a hoot.  I highly recommend this to any music fan!

006441034X|5.0|I absolutely loved the movie and when i saw in the credits that it was based on this novel i immediately bought this book. I was so happy to find that this book had more story lines than the movie.<br /><br />I loved that the movie had changed some small elements and i loved that story. But the book had so much more that made the story much richer and helped me to understand some of the holes in the movie plot.<br /><br />As far as the story itself, i fell that this is a good alternative to the Harry Potter set of adolescent readers. It has a good moral and there aren't any super scary parts. I especially loved the relationship between Howl and Sophie. Enjoy!
0743486285|5.0|I love Nikki Sixx and this book is a look into a side of his life many people may not know. He was one of few who have physically died from an overdose and been brought back (add Phil Anselmo-Pantera) to the list. Point being, this isn't something he thought of years after coming clean. These are excerpts from his personal diary that were locked in storage units until he discovered them. The way it's written and the songs on the Heroin Diaries soundtrack by his band Sixx: A.M. will take you through how Nikki Sixx felt. I'm so blown away by both...
0143038419|5.0|I simply could not put this book down. She writes  beautifully, and this story is so wonderful. Kudos to Ms Gilbert.      Erica Black  Author of \\"The Call Girl Actress, Confessions of a Lesbian Escort\\"

I applaud Sixx from coming from a place like that to where he is in his life now.

B0002F6AH0|5.0|The World At War series is a good historical account of WWII.  The series starts with causes of the war in both the European and Pacific theaters.   The first hours cover the rise of the Nazis in Germany and then switches to the early years of Japans' expansion. Many episodes cover specific battles or campaigns.  This series doesn't miss any important part of the war.  There is good coverage of the Nazi death camps showing, beyond any doubt, the implementation of the \\"Final Solution\\".  The world must never forget these atrocities.  This series should be required viewing for all.  \\"Those who do not read history are doomed to repeat it.\\"  This series also shows why men and women who fought WWII are called \\"the Greatest Generation\\"
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Thank god, for you guys amazon. Your service is great and the quality is the best. Supernatural is one of my family's favourite shows and as soon as the season ended, we automatically wanted to get the dvd. The special features are great but most of all funny and i think are a good addition, to the dvds, because in australia we dont have them included. The images before the episodes are great aswell. The show itslef, is about two brothers, Sam Winchester (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles). At the end of the 1st season the boys and thier father, John (Jeffery Dean Morgan) are involed in car crash and are injured quite badly. The first episode (In my time of dying) picks up at the aftermath of the crash. Supernatural is a very good show, with lost of suspence, drama and a fair bit of sarcasim, so i highly recomend it.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|My daughter is a sophomore in highschool and studying English literature.  As I never read these wonderful books, I am reading them along with her and then comparing the movies made.  Jane Ayre is my favorite of all the readings so far and this is the ONLY movie that makes sense.  All the others have minimal to no chemistry.  You seriously wonder why Rochester and Ayre get from governess and estate owner to lovers.  This adaptation has beautiful Rochester/Ayre chemistry and follows the book very responsibly so that you don't feel so much of the book has been reinterpreted. If you were to pick only one movie to represent this book, I would choose this one... It is beautifully acted.  Again.. Wow!
B000BBOUU4|4.0|I love this movie...Johnny Depp is always good at what he does...I personally think he's great in this movie.  I would have preferred if they had a \\"making of\\" in the special features section, but whatever...I learned how to dance like an Oompa Loompa...
B000RF7XZI|5.0|[[ASIN:B00007AJF9 Elizabeth]]  Cate Blanchett does a superb performance portraying Queen Elizabeth I. Strong in character, tender in the heart, she experienced life as most HRH's \\"did not dare\\" for the time period. She stood firm in her convictions as remaining a Protestant in ascending the throne, inspite of her sister's desire that she convert to Catholicism in a day when freedom of religion was still a concept. To have a sexual affair prior while on the throne for a queen was just unheard of. Blanchett poured every emotion she had into this character bringing a convincing life to the film.

0307387178|3.0|I liked this book because but there for the grace of God go I. I could relate to this story quite a bit having graduated from university, traveled the world and gone to work in Alaska myself. I think anyone who has struggled with the question of leading a purposeful life in the modern world will find this book intriguing.<br /><br />This story is sad, but in the end you are grateful knowing Chris couldn't have lived and died any other way. As much as he loved life, what other way could he have gone? He had a morality that was objective of religion and nation. It would have been very very hard for him to find a place in this world. Thank God he didn't have to live to see the age of Bush. He would have been really disappointed in humans if he'd been around to witness the current state of affairs.<br /><br />The reason I'm giving this three stars is that the story telling isn't very good. I liked about ten chapters of this book very well, then the writer's methods got old quickly. Krakauer did too much back and forth in the last third of the book. He'd write about another adventurer to illustrate his points about Chris, then go back to the story, then go back to another adventurer, then go back to Chris, then tell his personal adventure story, then go back to Chris. I think he went through four other adventurers life and his own. Too many examples over too many chapters to make one point about the kind of person Chris was. Seems like Krakauer could have condensed all the other adventurers stories into one chapter, but I don't think he would have had much of a book then. That's the problem when what started out as an article in Outdoor magazine gets stretched into a book- this book contains a lot of creative padding and quotes from good books like Walden. The writing is so-so, but again, this is a good story.<br /><br />I saw the movie after reading the book and frankly, Sean Penn did a better job as a story teller. He used Chris's sister to give the story narrative cohesion and left out the bits about the other adventurers and Krakauer's own journey. Works a lot better.bits about the other adventurers and Krakauer's own journey. Works a lot better.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I grew up watching this movie and have always loved it, but when I recently bought it for my 2 year old son I realized how inappropriate it is for young children.  I didn't think about the storyline, which is about an alcoholic running an orphanage who tries to seduce any man that comes for a visit.  I would save this one for older children...
074325144X|2.0|The author claims he runs 30 miles, effortlessly. I suppose that gives him some credentials. But I do not think he truly understands how muscles work, or physics, for that matter. The parts of the book that did make sense were  repeated so many times, I was bored with it. Relax, good posture, core strength all sounded like common sense to me. I don't buy the idea of your core creating a coil for your tendons and ligaments to do the work. Muscles do the work and SHOULD! But I kept an open mind. What do I know? I'm just a certified personal trainer. He studied with a tai chi master: wow!  The one suggestion that helped me was imagining the bungey cords pulling me forward.   Still trying to keep an open mind, I tried his suggestion to relax the glutes and run hills sideways. As a result, I developed inflammation in both of my TFL's. Several weeks, massages,icing, and accupuntures later, I finally picked up my marathon training again. I lost precious time and came in 45 minutes slower than before. I guess I should have followed his \\"brilliant\\" suggestion, and not focus on my time. I agree that you should run at a manageable pace, but without focusing on time and distances, I lost a lot of speed and satisfaction.  Back to tried and true and power running for me! I WILL train SAFELY for schedules and times. There are plenty of other books that teach how to train safely and effectively. And those books have the actual physics and science to back up their tips.
0743486285|5.0|I just finished the Heroin Diaries.  I have been a Motley Crue fan(particularly Nikki Sixx fan) for over 20 years.  I thought the book would be good, but I didn't think it would be as great as it was.    It is really disturbing at times and difficult to read just because his addiction was so scary and lonely and dark.  It's very strange to remember being at those concerts and knowing that Motley Crue was wild and crazy, but having know idea what was really going on.  It almost makes you feel guilty for not knowing what was going on!    I think the book was fantastic.  I finished it really quickly.  I cannot imagine that anyone could not love this book and admire Nikki Sixx for sharing the diaries.  I wouldn't have let anyone read the diaries and I think it took a lot of guts.    Nice job Nikki!
B000RG1FMO|4.0|its not his best work but  i still appreciate the brilliant effort kanye gives in to everything he does!
B000VI04HK|5.0|From the first chord, this live album is amazing (and I have not even looked at the DVD yet). The old hits are passionate and stirring, and the tracks from Around the Sun--an unfairly maligned album in my opinion, with a number of first rate songs--are beautiful. R.E.M. are an amazing studio band, but as this album shows, you really have to hear them live to truly appreciate their greatness.
B00013RC8O|5.0|Before I begin: I'll admit, this is not for everybody. It is for people who enjoy films instead of movies. Films that raise questions and make you think. Based in the exciting 70s, this is about a car driver who, on a whim, bets that he can make it from Denver to San Fransisco in 15 hours. He loads up on speed and heads west. In the raging spirit of the 70s, the same spirit that accompanied Easy Rider and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, he races against the law for what is right; what this reviewer believes is the American Dream. He is helped along the way by an apparently psychic radio DJ, a naked girl on a motorcycle (one of the most beautiful and purely free images I have ever seen), a hippie, along with several other miscreants that the society at the time considered bad. The story is as much about the rebellion and the characters he meets on the way as it is the chase itself. The film manages to beautifully capture every facet of the experience, from the monotony of the drive to the excitement of the chase to the fear of defeat.<br /><br />So, for those looking for what is perhaps the ultimate chase movie, this is it. But more so, this film is for those looking for inspiration into (or perhaps, remembrance of) the American Dream in a society where it was still possible.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|This cd, Siempre, by Il Divo, it absolutely beautiful.  It is a mixture of angelic, typical Il Divo, and fun tracks.  It has to be listened to with no distractions....I put the tape in my car and it is too powerful, too distracting, to  be driving to!  It is different from their usual, which I also love, of course.  Love to the guys, for the love they put out to us.  Stephanie, Newport Beach, Califoronia  USA.     PS: Everyone I introduce to Il Divo, including dvds is enchanted, thanks me in awe of them, and of course  goes out, buys and intros them to other friends of theirs.    PPS:  Urs, you hear from the angelic as did Mozart, Chopin, etc., and you remind me of an angel..your voice  and just you.

B000PFU7OO|5.0|I loved the movie and thought that the sound track would be about the same as The Swell Season, I think the movie idea came from this CD.  However, there are different versions of the same songs and also other songs from the movie.  I love it and each time I hear it I wish I could see the movie again.
B000UR9T82|5.0|Well, everyone who has seen the three movies by now will probably agree that the first spidey was good, the second was great and the third was a letdown in comparison to the first two.     This set has the three films, so I think it would be unfair to punish the first two because of the third (like many reviewers have done by now). To watch Spider-Man 2 in full HD glory is going to be a blast for every Spider-Man fan out there.    The first movie is a very good movie that is worth enjoying in HD, the second is one of the best superhero films in history and the third... well, the story falls short after the big anticipation generated by Spidey 2 (to many villains end up being a mess like others have put it), and in some points it just becomes too campy to endure, but nobody can deny that in terms of visuals it is still worthy of HD. Add to this all the extras on HD as well and you've got yourself a nice package.    The trilogy as a whole is entertaining, and Spider-Man 2 has story, deep villain, epic moments... (I know, I can't spot praising Spider-Man 2), and despite being weak in comparison to the others, the third film isn't that bad. It just had a lot to live up to, and it failed to do so, but you still get some awesome action sequences, and this set in particular includes the other two films.     So, the question you should ask yourself: Are three movies worthy of being seen in HD worth of the price?  If you enjoyed the Spidey trilogy enough to want to buy it, and if you appreciate High Definition, then I think the answer is definitely yes.
B000TLMWMY|5.0|I remember watching the original shows while living in NY and seeing these highlights was a joy.  My only regret (a big one) is not being able to see the shows in their entirety but why be piggish?    How wonderful to see Waylon when he was young and thin and without the hair on his face.  Ditto a very young Bob Dylan.  What a joy to see Cash and Seeger together and for Cash's having him on despite Seeger's being blacklisted (in the seventies, no less!).  And for Cash refusing to change the word \\"stoned\\" in \\"Sunday Morning Coming Down.\\"  Johnny stood up for what he believed it and lots of times we had no idea of his courage.    If you love Johnny, this is a must.  I watched all the tapes and one sitting and wanted more.
B000WZAE0Y|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, I didn't have high expectations. The trailer looked silly and I had practically disregarded the movie. Lately, actors of the size of Robert De Niro (who now can do anything they want) have been doing some campy and really bad movies (like Meet the Parents), so not even the big names were enough to interest me.     But then I started reading some reviews on imdb a couple of weeks after the movie got out. A lot of them agreed that the trailer didn't do justice to the film, and that although still not taking itself seriously, the movie somehow shined far beyond expectations. So I decided to give it try, and now I'm glad I watched this movie in the big screen.     For those who haven't seen it yet, the trailer indeed falls short. Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert De Niro are great, along with everyone else in the cast. The music score is amazing, the special effects are great, and the most important thing of all, the story is funny and it really taps into the best of the best of the fantasy genre.     This movie didn't have the success it deserved on the box office, so please, give it a try. It's not your typical fantasy film, it feels original, fresh, and it really entertains. Since the movie doesn't take itself too seriously, some people might consider it campy at first, but the best way to enjoy this great film is not to expect a deep drama (like the Lord of the Rings), but an entertaining fresh film.     Paramount has gone HD DVD exclusive, and for that we now get Stardust released on both DVD and HD DVD. If you have an HD DVD player, Stardust is a must in High-Def. Anyone who saw this movie in the theaters should agree.     Simply put, the movie is a visual feast without compromising the story and it really deserves a chance. Some may find it a little weird film, but Stardust is a sleeper hit that hopefully will get the success it deserves on DVD and HD DVD.
006056251X|5.0|After I finished Lillian's story, I was a bit worried. It Happened One Autumn was ok, but not great. I am so glad I got Devil In Winter. The story is very fast paced and you never get the feeling that Kleypas is dragging it out (like with Autumn). Sebastian and Evie share such a great romance and it builds quickly but believably. The dialouge is great and witty, the relationships between the leads and the secondary characters (esp Cam!) is really well written. This book is the best in the Wallflower series(Secrets of a Summer Night is a close second!).
B000002ULO|5.0|I'm trying hard to find the words to describe this music. The Beatles will always be known as the Best rock band ever. Paul's solo career created some great music, but this is the one cd from song 1 until it's over that will stand as his greatest ever. You catch yourself listening to it over and over again without wantin to take it out of the player. Go get it now.
0553378384|4.0|If you believe that life is a roadmap to discovery - and you are interested in a more detailed map, you might find Jan Spiller's book of interest.  As in many complex issues, there are no hard and fast answers on how to lead your life - but the descriptions of those in your \\"node\\" will likely resonate with you, and bring some perspective, which always does wonders.  I find some of the affirmations a bit hokey - but the goal and result seems to be heightened compassion - for yourself, and for those around you.  We may think it is impossible to categorize and generalize people into astrological signs, and in this book \\"nodes\\" - but surprise, surprise - for those you know well - the descriptions seem tailor made, for those you don't - a \\"what-if its true\\" scenario - that only broadens awareness and again compassion for how each human tries to cope.

B000VKJ6VS|4.0|People, this is not a five star album. I mean I like Alterbridge, but it's no five star album in any way. Every time I listen to this group I can't help but miss Scott Stapps voice and wonder what it would be like if he sung these songs. The music here is great and the lead singer has a good voice, but not like Scott Stapp. Again I do like this band and I own both albums. But people who rank this a five star album need to listen to more music. However, it is a solid album.

B000RT3RSQ|2.0|Okay, this is either sheer perversity or the people who remastered this Cooder series had burned out the treble circuitry on the board by the time they got to Jazz.  Instead of the usual extreme treble increase, Jazz has had a major cut, leaving it dull and lifeless and with no high end to speak of.  The gold standard here is the Mobile Fidelity LP, which IS a little warmer and smoother than the domestic CD, but the vinyl is still very clear and detailed.  The old CD isn't bad, but it sounds brittle compared to the MFSL album.  It's still much better than this Japanese mini-LP-sleeve version, though.
B00005LK94|5.0|Words cannot describe the depth of this film. This is man doing what he is supposed to do with the environment that he lives in. Protect and assist. This is also Jeff Daniels at his best. Funny and emotionally stirring. The soundtrack also is perfect.
B000TSIK14|5.0|Gotta love the Scorpions! I just love their sense of melodic composition! Some people have said that this recording is heavy on the ballad side, but I don't care. It still rocks! Several songs have a rockin' jilt and the softer songs still have the stingin' guitar work by the duo of Jabs and Schenker. It doesn't matter to me what they put out, they still rock and are growing young gracefully. I've grown with them and this effort is just plain addictive!  I listen to it everyday and the melodies are very hummmmm  able. Keep it up guys!
B000053VAZ|5.0|Great Great Movie. My husband and I first saw this movie on cable TV. We have On Demand and could watch it whenever we wanted for awhile. I decided to buy it so when it wasn't on anymore we would have it. Johnny Depp, Mary Stuart Masterson and Aiden Quinn were outstanding. I highly recommend this movie if you are a Johnny Depp fan.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|THE BAND: Bruce Springsteen (vocals, guitars, harmonica, organ, keyboards), Roy Bittan (piano, organ), Stevie Van Zandt (guitars, mandolin, backing vocals), Patti Scialfa (backing vocals), Clarence Clemons (saxophone, backing vocals), Danny Federici (accordion, organ, piano), Garry Tallent (bass), Nils Lofgren (guitar, backing vocals), Max Weinberg (drums & percussion, backing vocals). Several guest musicians perform as well.<br /><br />THE DISC: (2007) 12 tracks clocking in at approximately 47 minutes. Included with the disc is an 18-page booklet on heavy duty paper - containing song titles/credits, song lyrics, several photos of Springsteen (and one of the full band), and thank you's. The case is made out of an ultra slick cardboard. Recorded at Southern Tracks Recording Studio, Atlanta, GA. Label - Columbia / Sony.<br /><br />COMMENTS: I like \\"Magic\\" but it didn't hit me like I had hoped it would. Several sources read it was a strong return to his old form. To me, that was a huge statement. Would it ultimately rival the classic \\"Born To Run\\"? Perhaps be compared to \\"Darkness On The Edge Of Town\\" or \\"Born In The USA\\"? I went into the initial spins believing, but in the end, I was just a tad let down. I must say though, having listened to this album and digesting it for several weeks now, I'm liking it more. Most of the disc leans to the safe adult contemporary side. Though you'll find that a few of the tracks actually have some teeth. Standing back and looking at the disc as a whole - very good start, mediocre middle (specifically \\"Girls In Their Summer Clothes\\" and \\"I'll Work For Your Love\\"), great ending. The only considerable qualm I have is with the sound production - the muddy resonance, the fuzzy guitars... everything sounds overly loud... even though it's only turned up moderately on the home stereo, it still sounds like it's being blasted (same for the car stereo and the Ipod with headphones). All the songs are tucked neatly in the commercial 3-4 minute range except one (\\"Devil's Arcade\\" clocks in at 5:20). As for the songs themselves - more rock & pop than ballads or country, or any other category Bruce has tried. The opener \\"Radio Nowhere\\" is the fastest and hardest of the bunch... it's a good way to kick \\"Magic\\" off. There are a few songs reminiscent of \\"The River\\" or \\"Born In The USA\\" eras - \\"Livin' In The Future\\" (Clemons sax shines here, as do the catchy lyrics), \\"Last To Die\\", and my favorite song on the disc \\"Long Walk Home\\" (love the story, dig the slow intro and the band kicking in shortly thereafter, nice guitar solo followed by sax). \\"I'll Work For Your Love\\" sounds like a Bob Dylan piece, as does the slower title track \\"Magic\\". The title cut is easily the prettiest song on the album - clean vocals, soothing acoustic guitar, mandolin and violin. Bruce's other best tune vocally is on the dark \\"Your Own Worst Enemy\\"... which contains a nice harmonica intro and the first of any kind of guitar solo. The last (untitled) track is in ode to Springsteen's long time assistant Terry Magovern, \\"Terry's Song\\" (\\"When They Built You Brother, They Broke The Mold\\")... soft, acoustic with harmonica - nice. As catchy as some of the songs are, I feel Bruce's trademark guitar is simply absent. The guitar's are technically there of course... but they're present in a restrained vanilla kind of way. Plainly put - there are very few guitar jams or solos. As of 2007, Springsteen is 58 years old - and perhaps his days of ripping it (like he did in the 70's) are long gone. Having listened to him for decades, I guess I have to understand and accept this. Bruce is mellowing with age like a fine wine. He's comfortable in his surroundings, he's well established, and more importantly has proven himself album after album over the past 30+ years. I feel so many of the older legendary artists/bands (now in their 50's and 60's) releasing albums decades after their inception are leaning toward pleasant, well-mannered contemporary sounds. Onthe surface, Springsteen appears to be joining the likes of these older bands (i.e. - Steely Dan, Rush, Chicago, John Fogerty, Paul McCartney, etc). Bruce has an edge though, he's an incredible storyteller. The bold statements from the Boss and his E-Street Band might be gone, but it seems Bruce still has the know-how and drive to put out a decent album every few years. \\"Magic\\" is a good album from a legendary artist (4 stars).ringsteen appears to be joining the likes of these older bands (i.e. - Steely Dan, Rush, Chicago, John Fogerty, Paul McCartney, etc).

0061191981|4.0|This is Gordon Ramsay's life story in his own words.  He's had an eventful life and his success has come from hard work and smart decisions.  His father was an unpleasant  man who was often absent from the family home (when he wasn't beating his wife or moving the family across the country) and it is interesting to contrast how very differently his two sons have turned out.  While Gordon is highly driven and has been hugely successful, his brother has become a drop out and a drug addict.<br /><br />Gordon credits much of his success to the advice and support that he has received from his father-in-law and I found it quite moving how he has secured an alternative father figure in his life.<br /><br />This is a well written and involving book which really captures the man behind the image - and he is very different in many ways from the man that you think you know from Hell's Kitchen.  This book could have been a little shorter - it loses some momentum in the second half - but it's still very good.  If you enjoy Hell's Kitchen or just reading about life behind the scenes in the restaurant industry, I recommend this book.
B00003CXIP|5.0|So glad that I purchased Stand by me for my own collection and viewing! It was such an awesome movie when it first came out, and I enjoyed it just as much 20 years later.  Love the updated interviews with the cast and crew. That was great.  Just sad as to how much River Phoenix's life ended so abruptly the way that his character's did.

B0000TG9E2|5.0|One of the best of the Golden Age of Disney, Alice in Wonderland remains a delight for all ages.  Unlike recent Disney films using computer generated images, Alice was created by hand. Beautifully drawn, one frame at a time, by true artists who could create subtle emotion on the faces of the most nonsensical creatures.  This was true artistic talent, something sadly gone now from Disney Studios.  One of the most likeable things, besides the witty story, the absolutely whacky characters and the endless movement from one crazy situation to another, is the fact that unlike all of the Disney films in the past 20 years, the film makers do not PREACH their own agenda at you.  How quickly have films like Pocohontas and Squanto, rife with holier-than-thou moralizing about a Utopian world despoiled by inherently evil and stupid western males, passed to the second or even third tier of forgettable Disney fims.  Alice in Wonderland remains at the top with films like Pinnochio for one reason, they entertain. Unlike the boring, preachy, agenda riddled and UNFUNNY \\"cartoons\\" presented to kids today, here is a funny feast of escapism that with cause your kids to actually laugh while having their imaginations set free.
B00080ZG1A|4.0|I recently rented this at our local library, and unfortunately all they had was the\\"full screen\\" version - meaning, chopped off at the sides. Watching the aerial scenes, I realized this is NOT the way to view this movie!<br /><br />That said, I enjoyed \\"The Aviator,\\" despite its being a bit too long and unfocused. I wish Scorcese had taken more time at the beginning to develop Hughes' character, and spent less time on his relationship with Katherine Hepburn (whom I found REALLY annoying).<br /><br />\\"The Aviator\\" is not a definitive depiction of Howard Hughes' life (nor does it pretend to be) but if you enjoy lavishly-produced movies with great sets, decent acting, and a sense of history, you'll enjoy \\"The Aviator.'

B000P12LWY|4.0|First, I have taught history for over 20 years and I am well aware of the license given this show.  But despite the many errors (which all shows exhibit), this show will cause you to want to read REAL history that will provide the truth.  I applaud the show's effort and it certainly provides entertainment.  Without which, this show couldn't be made.  So watch the drama and read the history.  Shows like this and HBO's Rome will certainly spark your interest in the real thing!!!
0743486285|5.0|First off, other than their 1st 2 albums, \\"Too Fat for Love\\" & \\"Shout at the Devil\\" (which were great),I was never a huge Crue fan.  Their albums that followed were nothing but watered down, glam metal.  I am a musician and self proclaimed music buff, so before I left to Cancun for a vacation, I thought I better buy some reading material.  Well all I can say is I am glad I did!  I couldn't put this book down!  Nikki tells his story in a way that makes you feel like it is 1987 once again and you our a fly in his \\"heroine homes\\" wall.  It is truly amazing why the hell this dude is still breathing!  But I have to tell you, the biggest suprise by far is the CD.  It is hands down one of the best albums I have heard in years. Once you read the book then listen to the CD, it paints such a clear picure of Nikki's nighmare.  It's production is unbelievable and the songs are great.  James Michael, who is an award winning produce handles the singing for SIXX:AM.  He is an unbelievable vocalist and talent.  Also DJ Ashba who also helped with the arranging and writting is superb. Drums were programed, but they sound live on the CD, which is a huge feet in itself.  Anyway, if you like rock music and a great story, this Is the package to get.<br />Erik M,<br />Paso Robles, CA

B000FS9FCQ|5.0|I purchased this dvd because I just love this movie and I did  not have my own dvd. I purchased the 2 disk version because I like to know the behind the scenes information. This movie has great action sequences and the story is very good even though it differs a bit from the graphic novel which I like also. It does make you question the actions of different governments and the actions of \\"V\\". You have to stop and think who is right and if they are using the right tactics and what would you choose to do. Also the music to this movie is very moving and appropriate, it really emphasizes what is going on.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|During this time of the year, most movie studios release those surefire moneymakers known as \\"the summer blockbuster.\\" With movies like \\"Pirates of the Caribbean 3,\\" \\"Spider-Man 3,\\" \\"Shrek the Third,\\" \\"Transformers,\\" \\"Fantastic Four 2,\\" \\"Ocean's Thirteen,\\" and \\"Live Free or Die Hard,\\" it's hard to not be enticed into the studio's lure. But while these seasons come and go, and their neverending advertisements riddle our media, it's easy for most cinematic gems - ones more original and genuine - to fall out of our sights and sadly not be noticed until DVD release, if at all. One such gem is Fox Searchlight's release \\"Once,\\" starring Glen Hansard (only noticed as the red-headed guitarist Outspan Foster from Alan Parker's 1991 hit, [[ASIN:B00018D3XW The Commitments (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]]) and the beautiful, wistful Czech musician Marketa Irglova (whose voice somewhat resembles Tori Amos ... only Irglova's music is good).<br /><br />Hansard is also known as guitarist and leading man of the music group The Frames (with which director John Carney was bassist), and while he and Irglova have previously teamed up to record \\"The Swell Season\\" album as well as open for Damien Rice (whom Hansard's music sometimes resembles) on his first tour, their meeting in \\"Once\\" is so earnest and real that you'd think it was the first time these people had met. I heard most of the movie was shot with a long range lens, thus shooting the actors from afar and giving the movie more of a documentary feel than a fictional film, which works immensely. \\"Once\\" has such a basic boy-meets-girl storyline but with much more meaning. And it's that simplicity that helps make the overall message of this film so beautiful. The main characters don't even trivialize with stating names; all that matters is the connection these two have - much like that of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in [[ASIN:B00002E224 Before Sunrise]]. However, unlike \\"Sunrise,\\" there is no pretension with these characters, who do more than have romantic feelings toward each other and avoid their rehashings of their pasts. Despite the fact that they're virtually strangers, Hansard and Irglova have faith in each other; something that's sorely lacking in today's society. The two have a wonderful chemistry and I heard that they are/were dating in real life.<br /><br />Set in Dublin, Ireland, \\"Once\\" is the tale of a guy (Hansard) who's a vacuum repairman at his father's shop by day and a guitarist/busker by afternoons and evenings, trying his best to support his widowed father and get over a break-up with his girlfriend. One night, while performing one of his outstanding, passionate songs (\\"Say It To Me Now\\"), he's tipped by and meets a Czech girl (Irglova), who's amazed by his song and becomes somewhat of a fan. The next day, when bringing the guy her vacuum to repair, we learn that the girl is somewhat of a musician herself - she was trained by her father to be a damn good pianist. Shortly after, the two stop by a music shop where the girl plays piano for him and he soon is taking out one of his original songs for them to both sing. What follows is a simplistic-yet-magical scene set to a beautifully haunting song, \\"Falling Slowly,\\" where these characters bond. Without mincing words, this song is absolutely beautiful and brilliant! And it's a good precursor of what to expect from this film.<br /><br />With many critics describing this movie as a musical, or as director Carney described it: a \\"video album,\\" it's easy to agree because the film's music is featured so prominently and is played to help form and mold the characters. At times, \\"Once\\" feels a bit like an epic music video, but with much more feeling and story. Each time a song comes on, you feel more drawn to these characters, their lives and the connection they have. If you don't like the music, then there's something seriously wrong with your taste and you should probably start reevaluating what you consider to be good, real music.<br/><br />I won't disclose any more of the film or the several scenes I loved as I'm afraid that may take away from the visceral, feelgood emotions they invoke. All I will say is that \\"Once\\" is one of the best, innovative films I've seen in a long time. It's emotionally honest, the music is better than anything you'll hear on mainstream contemporary radio, and it'll leave you feeling both inspired and rejuvenated. This is not merely a film to see; it's a film to experience! There're so many emotions and memories that surface after viewing this film and that's the sign of a great movie! I have to admit that while I'll be among the masses going to see \\"Live Free of Die Hard,\\" the chance of me buying that movie on DVD is a lot more slim compared to my excitement in buying \\"Once\\" on DVD for multiple viewings! Between Hansard's humility and Irglova's charm, it's easy to fall in love with \\"Once\\" more than its title invokes.<br /><br />Sadly, because it's an independent film, you may have problems locating a theater where it's playing - which is a shame because, really, how many showings do we need of \\"Pirates of the Caribbean 3\\" or \\"Ocean's Thirteen\\"? But if you do notice \\"Once\\" on Netflix or at your local movie rental store, make it a top priority to see this film! Drop everything and just see it. Afterward, I'll even bet that you'll then soon be visiting a music store and buying the outstanding soundtrack or the duo's great preceding album [[ASIN:B000GH3CVQ The Swell Season]]./><br />I won't disclose any more of the film or the several scenes I loved as I'm afraid that may take away from the visceral, feelgood emotions they invoke.

0151013047|4.0|Mohsin Hamid's \\"The Reluctant Fundamentalist,\\" a novel shortlisted for this year's Man Booker Prize, has a killer hook. Changez, a Pakistani graduated top of his class from Princeton working at a financial firm in Manhattan, slowly becomes radicalized by America's response to the 9/11 attacks. Sitting down at a restaurant in Lahore, Pakistan, with a mysterious man who appears to be an American military operative, Changez tells the story of how he came to renounce the U.S.    The novel, briskly told in 184 pages, neither sensationalizes the subject matter nor uses it to lecture. Hamid tells the story in second person, with Changez as narrator and the reader in the position of the operative. \\"Excuse me, sir, but may I be of assistance?\\" it begins. \\"Do not be frightened by my beard: I am a lover of America.\\" As his story unravels, it becomes clear that something terrible is going to happen between Changez and the American, a cat-and-mouse game that's all the more intriguing because it isn't clear who's predator and prey.    Changez' job in Manhattan is to evaluate the financial condition of troubled companies with a ruthless eye towards the bottom line, cutting costs and downsizing workforces to grease the wheels for a buyout. \\"Focus on the fundamentals,\\" his company drills into his head, putting a different spin on the novel's title than the scowling young Muslim on the cover.    The particulars of the narrator's daily life in New York are secondary, at least in my mind, to his attempt to explain to an American why he renounced the country, returned home and took action against it. Hamid's storytelling is most compelling when Changez wrestles with feelings that would inspire the disgust of his American colleagues:    \\"The bombing of Afghanistan had already been underway for a fortnight, and I had been avoiding the evening news, preferring not to watch the partisan and sports-event-like coverage given to the mismatch between the American bombers with their twenty-first-century weaponry and the ill-equipped and ill-fed Afghan tribesmen below. On those rare occasions when I did find myself confronted by such programming -- in a bar, say, or at the entrance to the cable company's offices -- I was reminded of the film Terminator, but with the roles reversed so the machines were cast as heroes.\\"    Least compelling was his romance with an American woman that's one-sided, charmless and grim.    The war that nearly happened between India and Pakistan after the terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament in December 2001, an event I had almost forgotten, figures heavily in the book. Changez returns home as one million troops mass on the border. Hamid describes Lahore, the hometown of Changez and himself, in an unexpected way that demonstrates the glope-sweeping breadth of the Muslim world: \\"Lahore was the last major city in a contiguous swath of Muslim lands stretching as far west as Morocco and had therefore that quality of understated bravado characteristic of frontier towns.\\"    Wounded national pride figures strongly in \\"Reluctant Fundamentalist,\\" which ratchets up the tension towards a thrilling end. Hamid began the book before 9/11 to tell the story of why a secular Muslim, living large among America's elite, might resent the country. 9/11 changed everything.

1582701709|5.0|I saw the movie quite some time ago online, and just recently looked at the book.  One page stood out as exceptionally wise and practical, and I ordered the book here a few days later.    That ONE page alone was telling of the value of planning your next day thoroughly as a way of creating your future the way you want it to be.  Logical, and it should be obvious, but for the majority of people it is not a regular habit, and therefore they do not have the control over their future that they could potentially have, to make it what they want.    They miss the profound wisdom of incorportating this simple habit into their life, and thereby creating the life they would like to have for the next day, week, month, year, decade and half century.    Sad.  Our lives are the result of the habits and attitudes and thoughts we live by, more than anything else.    Many here have panned this movie and perhaps the book which is a transcript of the movie, as not being a \\"Secret\\", but that this is information that has been available to all for a long long time.  This is true, to a certain extent.  But in this format, the essence of the teachings has been made readily accessible to THIS generation, and therefore many who have not had the time or knowledge to cull it out from the many teachings of the past have now been exposed to the best of the wisdom about how to create the life you passionately want by controlling your thoughts and feelings so that you can get them in alignment with your heart's desires.    Fools criticize based on their limited experience and what others have said in the negative about something.  Intelligent and wise people actually investigate for themselves thoroughly before judging something as bogus or the work of a charlatan.    Larry King and Oprah Winfrey are not fools, and neither is the famous actress Nicole Kidman.  They are gifted, very bright people who have learned how to make a success of their lives, and all three of them HIGHLY recommended the movie THE SECRET as authentic, and a very practical and valuable tool which anyone should be able to use effectively to move them closer to realizing their ideal life.    This is a stunningly powerful gift to the world.  I recommend it without the slightest reservation or cavet.    -Robert Burns
0140157352|4.0|[[ASIN:0140157352 Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In]]  This book certainly shows how to save face - showing how to accomlish an objective without giving in.   It also is easy to read and an excellent start for the 'beginner' stepping into this area of reading, with a view to acting on the information provided.   I recommend this as well as \\"Getting Past No\\" by the same author, for the beginner and the novice negotiator.
0143038419|5.0|I read Eat, Pray, Love while revising a memoir, a mother's journey. Even though the particulars of Elizabeth Gilbert's life  differ--a lot--from mine, her spiritual quest to decipher, transform, and transcend pain is one I think most of us share--and prefer to take on vicariously. If Gilbert elicits extreme ratings, it may be because we're either grateful she hit the nail on the head for us or mad she missed the mark. I myself enjoyed Gilbert's humor, her lively writing, her cultural comparisons, her passion for little and big adventures. What did not strike a chord with me in her story is probably what is too different from my own story, one about elbowing life's mysteries with a child's rare disorder. If any reader visiting this site for Eat, Pray, Love is also interested in another spiritual journey, a funny/sad/happy tale--Finding Magic Mountain--blurbed by Isabel Allende & Anne Lamott, then Elizabeth Gilbert's \\"search for everything\\" might boost an even larger quest.

0060855924|5.0|I first read The Colour of Magic in 1985 when the Signet paperback came out.  Pratchett was still an unknown quantity and I'm not entirely sure why I picked it off the shelves.  But pick I did, and so began a long relationship with a writer who has made irreverence and art form.  In retrospect, it's easy to see how this first volume presaged the nearly 30 Discworld novels that were to follow.  But what is old hat now was brilliant invention back then.  The stock opening of a review is something like \\"picture an immense disc of a world careening through space on the back of four elephants who in turn stand of the back of A'tuin the giant tortoise...\\"  All too true.  In fact, A'tuin is to large that, it you look over the edge of the disc, it's tortoise all the way down.<br /><br />A small dot on the map of the disc is the city of Ankh-Morpork, and an even smaller dot marks the Invisible University, where a very tiny dot marks the place where an incompetent magic student named Rincewind opens the Octavo spellbook and manages to learn one of the eight great spells of the Creator, who apparently left them behind in disgust.  Rincewind, his magic storage filled to overflowing with this single spell is promptly expelled.  Our hapless magician spends is time sipping small beer in an even smaller tavern until he happens on another tiny mark on the map called Twoflower, who is possibly the world's first tourist, who spends gold like water and is accompanied by a walking luggage with an attitude.<br /><br />Rincewind believes (for about 15 minutes) that his future is made as a tour guide, until he discovers that Twoflowers has a knack for landing in any number of near death experiences, which early on include burning Ankh-Morpork to the ground.  Thinks don't get any better than that.  Further adventures include nearly getting eaten (by almost everything) a bad experience with a number of imaginary dragons, and the up close examination of the edge of the world.  That Rincewind and Twoflowers manage to survive intact is remarkable.  That they also make fools of the known (and unknown) universe is just part of the grand vision that Pratchett opens for our delight.<br /><br />Terry Pratchett is a genuinely funny author.  His tongue in cheek writing picks up on every foible, finds the vaudeville in every scene, and leaves no solemnity untweaked.  His humor can be brutal or subtle by you will keep finding things to smile at long after the book is closed.  His characters and scenes lampoon reality and develop a life of their own.  Pratchett doesn't waste an opportunity or a bit of material and much of what you see here for the first time will echo through the coming volumes of the series.  Dig in!  Ignore the troll at your own risk.anage to survive intact is remarkable.

0805080120|5.0|Let's be honest; I am no linguist but I learned so much about the origins of language reading this book. Reading about the subject interested me because of something I am curious about. Looking for books on the subject, I noticed the mention of this book in a review for another book about 'the mother language.' This received high approval ratings, so I took a chance and haven't regretted the decision.
1582701709|5.0|If you read down, you will see a zillion reviews complaining that The Secret is superficial, simplistic, and looks like an informercial, followed by suggestions for better books. There are even reviews from people who haven't read/seen it. Yes, it's cheesy, the art and art direction downright awful, the acting worse, yet the message is real. What makes The Secret different from all those other books is, despite its flaws--or maybe because of them, who knows?--its reaching millions of people who have never before come in contact with this information. So like it or not, it's doing something right, something all those other more tasteful books were unable to do. For that you have to give it credit. As for the emphasis on material gain, money worries may be the #1 issue for most people. The divide between rich and poor in this country is wide and people are struggling--why shouldn't they want to be free of that? When you think of all the negativity we're fed every day in the media, it seems small-minded to quibble with something so many people find inspiring and helpful.

There are many things that are left unfinished, HOPEFULLY there will be the rumored 2-hour movie or mini season to tie upi these loose ends. Until then, everyone should buy and enjoy season 7.

B000GG4Y32|4.0|In spite of the fact that it does feel like a vanity project, this is the penulimate Warren Beatty movie.  It's like watching a David Lean movie.  The arguments that Beatty and Keaton are just marvelous and this is one of her performances and that's saying something.  Also Jack Nicholson who practically steals every scene he's in.  In fact, there's a large supporting cast at the top of their game and that says something about Beatty's skill as a director.  He considerably slowed down his input after this, probably thinking how's he ever going to top this.  My only real complaint are the witnesses, not that they're there, they serve their function well as a Greek chorus.  But there's no identification and guessing their identies distracts from the movie.  It was fun seeing Gene Hackman and Beatty share the screen again.  My second favorite Beatty movie is \\"Bonnie and Clyde.\\"
0345494997|5.0|This is a wonderful \\"historic\\" novel about FLW and Mrs. Cheney.  The author set the story of a hushed-up affair to be a romantic and loving relationship.  FLW was always known to be a abuser of his first wife and children, but, in those times, running off with a married woman was marked with quite a stigma.  The author's description of their lives in Oak Park, Europe and Wisconsin makes one feel as they were all living together at the same time.  Hooray for historical \\"novels\\"!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I can't say I've ever even heard of the CW network, which is probably why I never knew about this show.  I randomnly found it on netflix and decided to give it a try.  Supernatural is now my favorite television series.  It combines, horror, drama, and comedy perfectly.  Every episode is unique, and doesn't get stale quickly.  There is a recurring plot that pops up througout Season 1, that keeps you hooked to the show.  I would highly reccomend this show to anyone interested in horror films.
B000RW3YYA|5.0|I've got to say that, with the departure of SG-1 off the air, Atlantis has become more and more interesting to me.  While I had seen season 3 previously, having it on DVD to watch again has been great.  It also is nice to see the latter half of the season, as the Atlantis team is shook up and everything shifts in preparation for what comes in season 4 (and which has already aired).    I definitely would say that this season is at the top of Atlantis' work thus far.  I look forward to season 4 and the episodes that come from it.

0061547832|4.0|Best book by the Donald yet. Lots to like, but some annoyances that keep me from giving the book five stars.<br /><br />First, a disclaimer. Those who are repulsed by the author's bombastic style will not enjoy this book and likely will not be able to see through the style issues to mine the exceptional wisdom offered throughout the book.<br /><br />Set aside style issues, here is what you can expect. Clearly, the author has achieved incredible business success. And, clearly he is also a master at personal branding. As such, his candid offering of the keys to his success is good stuff.<br /><br />Enhancing the wisdom Trump offers up is the reinforcement offered by co-author Bill Zanker, founder of the Learning Annex. I thoroughly enjoyed Zanker's commentary and his style. I came away admiring Zanker for what he has built and how he has apparently personally grown through that building process.<br /><br />Kudos to publisher Harper Collins for the interesting use of a co-author to an icon such as Trump. Boos to the publisher for what I found to be poor editing (e.g. points and events introduced in subsequent chapters as if they were being introduced for the first time). Yes, we live in a fast paced ADD world but some of us actually recall what we read in the previous chapter(s).<br /><br />So here is the bottom line: nuggets of gold in this book if one can set aside the repetitive aspect and the bombastic style that sometimes is very annoying.<br /><br />Wayne Dyer and other great philosophers are long on making the point that we can learn from others, even from the tyrants who come into our life. Trump is someone I have learned from and will continue to learn from. Some of the learnings are positive, others are in the form of strong messages of how I don't want to be like him. Point is that he is a strong teacher for me and can be others if you put his thoughts, action, etc. in the context of developing ones personal philosophy of success, as opposed to just trying to replicate him.<br /><br />PS Let there be no doubt that the author fully understands that controversy sells books and other products, at least for him. Count on it that Trump will understand that the flame ratings that likely will start showing here will help sell more books. As Rosie O'Donnell has proven, flaming the Donald just creates controversy that keeps him in the news, thereby enhancing his visibility.at the author fully understands that controversy sells books and other products, at least for him.

This book and a trip to the doctor to discover he has developed an auto-immune condition and he's agreed to a 12-week vegetarian trial. I know the power of not eating animal products and am excited to get my husband on board. If it weren't for the common sense, scientific, non-biased results expressed in this book, I never would have been able to convince my optometrist husband that diet is likely the culprit. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
6304779356|4.0|If you are in the market for a good vampire movie, this is the one. Still holds up well after all these year.  What I also like about this movie is, though it is fairly gory in some scenes (vampire death scenes and a little on the beach party), it does not rely upon gore to the degree that more recent vampire movies do. Instead, it mostly relies on the story it is telling.
0739337270|5.0|I read maybe one book a year that would deserve five stars...and I read a lot of books. This book ranks right up with Lonesome Dove, Life of Pi, and Left Hand of Darkness as one that will transcend genre and time to become one that is read over and over.  What is particularly striking is Zusak's very accurate descriptions of a very difficult place in history, and the emotional makeup of the people who went through it. He has layered this with contemporary sensibility by using Death as an omniscient narrator. At the beginning of the book, I was somewhat put off by this as he uses the same visual cues as Terry Pratchett in putting the words of Death in boldface, but eventually it became clear that the conceit was necessary and serves as a distancing device. If the story had been told as a first person narrative from one of the main characters, or even from multiple viewpoints, it would have been too sentimental. As it is, it unflinchingly shows tragedy and brutality, kindness and humor, leavened with just enough irony to make it one of the great novels.    My 95 year old aunt is also an avid book lover, and even more particular. Luckily this book has made it easy to pick out her Christmas present. My only hesitation in buying it for her in audiobook form is that this book relies on its physical presence almost as much as a graphic novel. It would take a very skillful reading to put this across.
B000SFZ05C|4.0|On the eve of their opening show for the Born Into This tour, I felt    compelled to write up a review.  I have a Row Two seat at Pala Casino     in North San Diego County for the Oct. 17 opener.  Having listened to     the new C.D. three times, my initial rating is 3 1/2 stars.         The production is stripped down a bit-- no \\"wall to wall sound\\" like     Beyond Good and Evil.  The 10 tracks play under 42 minutes, less bang     for the buck.  I wish they had added a few live tracks from their     Instant Live series.  Six years since their last C.D. , you would think    they would have more tracks recorded.  This is a must for Cult fans, the    die hards.  Not a good introduction for new listeners.  The music seems    to harken to their Love - Sonic Temple period.  Some tracks have a     droning ,metallic bass line to them.  Track 5, Holy Mountain, seems out    of place-- a piano driven ballad.  The rest of the songs are true to Cult    form, the title track, Dirty Little Rockstar, Illuminated, will hold     their place with Cult standouts from the past.  I'm hoping that hearing    this album live will add depth to my initial listening experience.

1573229725|5.0|For anyone who hasn't discovered the literary genius of Sarah Waters, it won't be long before you'll want to devour every word the best-selling, award-winning novelist pens.  My admiration goes beyond the author's expertise in capturing the mood reminiscent of Oliver Twist. Waters extensive research enriches the vivid setting. Her spot-on characterizations combined with a highly absorbing plot captivate both critics and readers alike.  If I were to go back to Victorian England, more precisely London 1862, I bet it would look, smell, taste, and sound as Waters has deftly described it. If I would have been asked to root for a thief, I should say not. But Susan Trinder, an orphan who through a twist of fate only knows a crooked life, is worth saving. And what of Maud Lilly? Orphaned as well, she lives a seemingly charmed, though lonely life, in a country estate of her uncle, much as a caged bird.  Left in the hands of evil folk who prosper by unsavory means, can the fates of both women be spared? How much strife can a woman endure before she loses her mind, heart, and soul?<br /><br />Fingersmith is the story of two young women who have nothing in common except the acquaintance of a man who goes by the name Gentleman. He's a crook who means to ruin an heiress in order to make his fortune. As part of Gentleman's plan to get rich quick, Susan leaves Mrs. Sucksby, the woman who raises her, and London, the only home she's ever known. When she travels to Briar to pose as Maud's maid, she soon discovers a connection that goes beyond the treacherous scheme that brings her and Maud together. Despite deceit, their kinship is cemented during all the time they spend in each other's company. Their heartstrings are pulled tight with thoughts of what is to happen next. They share a love believed to be so hideous as to be shunned by society and yet through it all, the hope of good coming out of evil is the hope that has readers turning the pages.<br /><br />Gentleman, a despicable yet thoroughly charming con man, evokes little or no sympathy but he's entertaining in his cunning sort of way. Then there's Mrs. Sucksby, a petty thief, who raises Susan as a means to an end. When Mrs. Sucksby sells the other orphaned infants but keeps Sue as her own, Waters compels us to discover the motive behind baby farmer's actions. Mr. Lilly, Maud's uncle, is a depraved man who enslaves a girl for his gain. It makes us wonder how some people have few scruples to inflict cruelty upon others.<br /><br />Waters captivates her audiences through vivid imagery as each scene builds the suspenseful plot only to pull a fast one at every turn. Anyone who longs for a Victorian novel told expertly in the Dickens style, who loves surprises, who enjoys characters to sink your teeth into, and who wants to come away uplifted, would do well not to hesitate another moment.  Head over to your bookshop or on-line seller and pick up a copy today. Susan and Maud will forever be in your heart. You won't be able to put it down.

0375847227|5.0|There are enough (I dare say much more than enough) reviews out there that pertain to the actual contents of the book, whether it be good or bad, so I shall not express how awesome I think the trilogy is. I, instead, want to comment on the various editions of the book/trilogy available out there. I personally bought the Dark Materials Omnibus, which is absolutely gorgeous, and has very sturdy binding. The cover has a nice texture to it, and is much lighter than one would expect for its size (it is quite large). However, I have seen other versions of the trilogy, and I found that the paperback versions, printed by Knopf, are also wonderful and pleasing to the eye, which are printed with heftier paper than the Omnibus. The \\"standard\\" versions (the ones that cost 7.50 or so) are also great, though not as pretty as the other ones; they are, however, lightweight and tightly bound (I got those for my brother, who enjoyed the series). However, if you are in search of a copy to give as a gift, then I suggest the Omnibus or paperback versions, simply because of its aesthetic value.
0385338686|3.0|I read this book in one sitting.  It was a quick read and I enjoyed it. There were parts of the book that I found frustrating when the main character wouldn't speak up.

0800199421|4.0|As action thrillers, go, AIR FORCE ONE has enough of a plot to keep you watching closely as terrorists take over the presidential plane, a sleek beauty of a craft that makes a gleaming set piece for this kind of adventure in the sky. And who is better qualified to take care of things than HARRISON FORD, somewhat less impressive without that hat and familiar stubble as Indiana Jones. (Well, maybe KEVIN COSTNER who was originally slated for the role).<br /><br />GLENN CLOSE makes a very commanding presence as the Vice President, seemingly never at a loss in moments of distress, and GARY OLDMAN handles his Russian accent and menacing villainy with his usual aplomb. It's just that if you stop long enough to take a breath while all the action is going on, you might see that underneath all the fancy pinnings this is regulation stuff that's been time countless times before--and sometimes with better results.<br /><br />The cast is impressive with WILLIAM H. MACY and DEAN STOCKWELL on the prez's team and Jerry Goldsmith providing another one of his dependable, if unmemorable, action scores.<br /><br />And although Wolfgang Petersen does a nifty job of directing, turning the president of the U.S. into an action hero performing stunts that seasoned stuntmen must have been hired for, does stretch credibility a good deal for the climactic moments when airborne peril is at the max for a cliffhanger ending.<br /><br />Not bad as an action thriller, but just don't expect it to be any more substantial than a sleek new video game.
0753821788|4.0|This book delivers a writing style which is both new and rejuvenating.<br /><br />Classically loyal to the concept of bureaucratic ploy, the plot of the book delivers a contradictory premise: evidencing a government bureaucracy becoming involved and fulfilling a \\"dead at arrival\\" concept of infusing salmon (a cold water fish) to the hot arid lands of Yemen.<br /><br />Conscripted by his government to aid in the development of a sheikh's passion to deliver fish of the northern hemisphere to his equatorial land, the protagonist, Dr. Alfred Jones, initially eschews the requests demanded of him.  It is preposterous, he thinks -as does anyone else. To be called upon to deliver an act which would ordinarily be deemed an exclusive right for the almighty, Dr. Jones understands that he needs to keep his job and thereupon surveys the concept and architects the impossible dream. And, does it become realty? You will have to read it to find out.<br /><br />The writing style is what makes this book both comical and seemingly relevant. It includes: numerous e-mails between Jones and his career-driven Oxford educated (he is too) wife who leaves his home for an opportunity to make even more money than he does (a fact she too often reminds him about in their e-mail correspondence); journal entries by the protagonist; articles from various newspapers;  transcripts of television accounts; transcripts of interrogations relating to criminal and other acts;  intergovernmental memoranda; intergovernmental e-mails; and (my favorite),  transcripts of Parliamentary sessions which involve the salmon issue as well as lost soldier Robert - whose betrothed works with Dr. Jones.<br /><br />The prose often delivers other delicious items. The dialogue of the rogue fishing-bitten sheikh displays enormously talented diplomatic statements which only trained diplomats or monarchs would recite -  flawlessly and seemingly effortlessly.<br /><br />As the book evolves, the characters dive deeper and deeper into bitter sweet alliances, trysts and victories. And, you just have to continue as the writer lures you to see \\"if it all works out.\\"<br /><br />For anyone wanting a quick and delightful read, I recommend this book.d victories.

This is one of the few albums that I ripped onto iTunes, gave all the songs five star ratings, and then listened to each one and I didn't have to change the rating. Josh Groban has yet to disappoint me and I don't think he will. He's beyond talented and he knows what works for him. I enjoyed the DVD too. I love hearing Josh talk about why Awake is the way it is, and I love his sense of humor. It made me love him even more. My favorite songs on the album are Weeping, You are Loved, and Solo Por Ti.

Not a popular opinion I know but I had my fair share of that stupid religion over the years. The main character was a tightly wound christian copper who flinches at any sign of \\"immorality\\" (i.e. the wonderful sex act) and really needs to get his head out of his bible and embrace real life.<br /><br />That said, the pagans are kooky as well but at least they are not ashamed of their humanity.<br /><br />Christopher Lee and Edward Woodward really make this film so much better than it could have been with other actors (see recent remake with Nic Cage for proof) and I really enjoyed this slow-burning story.<br /><br />Try to watch it without knowing the ending as it makes the experience a more memorable one.<br /><br />Special mention goes to Britt Eckland for that dance, OMG, thank you so much for that one Britt! You had my undivided attention!
B000UGG39Q|4.0|Down - NOLA is one of my top five albums of all time so I was hoping to rate this as another five star release but like Down II it falls a little short.  The first half is really great and I am looking forward hearing them played on the upcoming tour.  Songs N.O.D. and On March the Saints are really great.  Any fan of Phil Anselmo won't be disappointed in this release.
0743486285|5.0|I have had a crush on Nikki Sixx since middle school 1983. I could not put it down. My co-worker said the same thing.  Very raunchy subject matter but it is the reality of the lifestyle and shows that it doesn't matter how famous or well known you are that if you do not take care of your hidden demons, they will destroy you. Addiction is a disgusting, sad and lonely thing. For those of us who have been drunks or sex addicts or whatever your poison is you can relate to a certain level. If you want to understand the world of an addict, READ THIS BOOK!  Thanks Nikki for sharing your lowest and highest points of your life.
B000ULQV0W|4.0|This is a great CD by Eddie Vedder, if you like Pearl Jam, especially the the mellower songs by Pearl Jam, you should love this CD. Eddie Vedder does an outstanding job, the songs are pretty mellow, and are thoroughly enjoyable. The downside is that a few of the songs are less than 2 minutes long. One song that is a prime example is \\"wolf.\\" The tune is great, but there are no (actual) words, and it's only like a minute and a half long. Definitely worth buying if you love Eddie Vedder (and/or Pearl Jam.)
0156027321|5.0|Fiction is so homogenized these days, its boring.  Not so with this book. Its refreshing and reads more like a non-fiction set of events than a novel. Loved it.
B000TM1CL0|5.0|I absolutely love this show.  My favorites shows are Shark and The Closer.  Even though I watched the first season, I bought Season one DVD from Amazon.com and just finished watching the entire series.  I had missed several small things so I was so glad I ordered it.  You must not miss the last show of the season \\"Wayne's World 2: Revenge of the Shark\\".  In an episode mid-series, Shark lost a case about a serial killer.  This same serial killer is arrested and tried again for yet killing another girl.  DO NOT MISS THE LAST 5 MINUTES.  I could not believe what I was watching.  The only thing I don't like is the daughter storyline.  Every time her \\"story\\" is on I tend to lose interest.  I am hoping they will drop that line in future seasons.
B00000F14B|5.0|just a great musical - one of the best ever produced by hollywood -<br />recommended for everyone
B00008G6EZ|5.0|This is a thrilling performance. It is deeply attractive on a number of levels, of which I would stress just one--the stage (and screen) presence of the central male duo: Rodney Gilfry as Don Giovanni and Laszlo Polgar as Leporello. Those two are funny and sexy, often both--delicious to listen to and to look at. Given how much time they spend on stage together, this is crucial for the success of this opera. Both are fantastic singers and actors, and the costume designers and choreographers have done them justice. The pair moves superbly and their costumes give any number of fashion designers a run for their money. Gilfry is magnetic, as he should be. Don Giovanni should singularly arrest the gaze of a viewer, especially a female viewer, and Gilfry does. `Finch'han dal vino' is even faster than on the Gardiner CD version (which is gorgeous as well), and this makes it even more exciting in my book. In its essence, that aria is a musical expression of male display, and it should be sung with dizzying speed. Compliments to Nikolaus Harnoncourt for recognizing this. Cecilia Bartoli is volcanic indeed as Donna Elvira, adding a hefty dose of female charisma to the mix, and Liliana Nikiteanu is fabulous as Zerlina. Overall, a performance that is musically excellent and utterly believable in its electrifying sexual energy.

B000KN7BIQ|5.0|This is one my favorite movies of all time, and was one of the first HD movies that I bought after purchasing my new 65\\" High Definition plasma TV.  You feel as if you are part of the cast of characters.  You see things you never saw on regular DVD.  This movie stands the test of time, and is still on my list of the best 20 movies ever produced in Hollywood.  I cannot overrate the High-Definition DVD.  It looks and sounds absolutely superb.
B000UR366S|5.0|The only thing I wish to say is, those who give this Joni cd a negative review really need their heads sorted.Its better than every single one of those relaxation cds, we are sometimes led astray with.Listen to the words listen to the music.Its a hard task but so so rewarding.It takes you to another place, away from the stresses and strains of everyday excistence,just enough to re-energise your battery.Exellent,exellent.Mr Jeremy Gloff(other reviewer) you said it all,exellent review sir.
B00005JLH3|5.0|I was in a hotel room and turned on the TV to all this exciting drumming, camaraderie, competition, musicianship in the trenches, and I got so excited!  This movie reminds me of music camp, of music school.  It is realistic.  Then I showed it to my husband, who played in bands.  He also went to a black college, where band life is serious.  And he knew what that movie was talking about.      Competitions with other bands.  Should a black band director focus on classical music, or should he try to play what's on the radio?  Can they meet somewhere in between?  What do you do with a student who's so talented that it doesn't matter that he can't read music?  Drumline answers all these questions, and even if you weren't asking them in the first place, you'll be glad to see the answers.  Drumline sweeps you up in its story, and takes you on a thrilling ride.  That's what makes it one of the 7 happiest black movies of all time.

192076920X|3.0|I read this book while in India and it was perfect for the hours of long bus rides/ waiting around. Roberts is not a great litterary genius and his writing borders on a male Danielle Steel - BUT if you want an intersting story line that will keep you capitivated and can abstain from the cheesy parts of his writing, I recommend this book.
B000QEIOUS|5.0|This has become my favorite Al Pacino movie, and was one of the first HD movies that I bought after purchasing my new 65\\" High Definition plasma TV.  It is a most unique story, and it will touch your \\"funny bone\\" as well as your heart.  The HD version will bring to life your favorite scenes, such as when Pacino dances the Tango with the beautiful brunette.  Instead of being an outsider looking in, you'll feel as if you are actually sitting at a cocktail table by the dance floor as Al Pacino dances so gracefully.  This title is a must in anyone's HD-DVD library.
B000SFZ05C|3.0|After six long years when the fiercely thunderous \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\" brought The Cult back from oblivion, we get this. \\"Born Into This\\" is a snooze. To be frank, this album is flat-out boring. It never really picks up or goes anywhere and lacks any kind of energy. Adding to the mediocrity, singer Ian Astbury sounds tired as the album lacks his usual howling roars. The album is also very short. All in all, die-hard Cult fans may appreciate a few of the songs, but its an overall disappointment. 2 1/2 stars.
0374105235|3.0|This was one of my Book Club's selections for this fall.  I thought it was easy to read and I am glad I saw the movie \\"Blood Diamond\\" before reading this.  It's a difficult subject matter but worth reading.

B000VS6QTK|2.0|I know that this concert was filmed back in 1991, and to compare it to more recent recordings that were made for HD isn't a fair comparison, but i doubt that there is much a difference from the regular DVD and the blu ray version.  The footage is very grainy and when you see the shots from a distance it looks like every other pixel on the screen is a white dot.   The sound is great(especially if you have a good theater system), but the video of this disk isn't up to what i'd expect for High Definition.

B0002IQNAG|5.0|I first watched Dawn of the Dead years ago when I bought the VHS version with the extended version and extras, a two VHS set. About a few years ago I bought the Dawn of the Dead dvd version, but found out this was the American release and not the full extended version. It was missing the entire police station looters scene, which I felt was a critical point in the movie.<br /><br />Very happy to finally own the full dvd set and see the extended version as it was in dvd quality. The other versions included with the set are great as well, especially the dvd showing the making of the movie with the cast.<br /><br />For the movie, I still feel this is one of the rare zombie theme movies that dwells on the people more than the zombies. Not to give away any spoilers for anyone who has not seen the movie, the movie starts out like any other zombie film, there's a unknown outbreak of a virus returning the dead back to life.<br /><br />Shortly into the movie we meet all of the main characters and they make a final break to freedom from the zombies. They find a safe haven, a new at the time indoor shopping mall. What takes place next is a twist from typical zombie movies. The movie starts to heavily focus on the people, who are now somewhat trapped in the mall. It's covered with all of the items they need but at the same time, it's also their prison.<br /><br />We start to realized that even with all of the material items, without freedom, there is little happiness. During the end of the movie this is covered again, where a problem occurs when Steve fights for the mall since \\"we took it, it's ours\\" from other intruders.<br /><br />As a side note, the characters in this movie feel like real everyday people rather than in most zombie movies such as Day of the Dead, where everyone is not friendly nor have any emotion. Dawn of the Dead is one of my favorite horror films for this reason.<br /><br />On the topic about gore and fx, for 1970's horror it's actually pretty well done, hats off to Tom Savini. For people new to the movie, it's going to look very cheesy, with melted crayon looking blood and gray faced zombies. Also the acting is not great at times, in the extras dvd it was mentioned that the casts was largely new to acting.<br /><br />Overall it's a great horror movie that has deeper meaning than a typical zombie or horror film. The story and plot is great, at times feels really slow but also has some good action as well. For gore fans there's some brutal scenes, nothing that can over top the current gore but still gets me cringing. The crayon blood looks bad but I heard it was done to make the movie feel like a comic book which bright blood instead of a natural darker colored blood.e movie, it's going to look very cheesy, with melted crayon looking blood and gray faced zombies.

B000N3ST7K|5.0|I am an avid Tarantino fan, so it's only natural that I would love this movie.  Death Proof is classic Tarantino at it's finest!  Loads of intriguing and entertaining dialogue, strong and beautiful women, creepy homicidal men still loaded with charm, and quick, brutal action scenes.  Plus the cars in the chase scenes!  Gorgeous, simply gorgeous!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I loved this show. I bought it based solely on the premise; in short, a serial killer, who works for the Miami Police, targeting exclusively other criminals and killers. That alone was enough to make me pick this up. The first viewing of the season was enough to cement it as one of my favourite television shows, up there with Weeds, another Showtime winner.  Michael C. Hall is absolutely perfect for the part of Dexter. He has the physical presence and blank expressions needed to pull it off. Blank isn't the right word... there's something going on in his mind, but it's clearly not emotionally involved. All the performances are solid, and the writing is crisp and clever. It's a bit bogged down in its own concept for the first two or three episodes (Dexter, upon giving away the last of the donuts he brought to work, looks at the box and thinks, \\"Empty inside, just like me.\\"), but the writers lose the need to make a point of their individuality very quickly, and that's when the show really takes off. At times emotionally involving (Ironically enough), funny, thrilling, terrifying, creepy, and often brilliant, it's the best new show I've seen in a long time. I look forward to the future.

B000053VAF|5.0|Dogma's great. The story itself is interesting, and overall very engaging. The acting is well done, eventhough i do have contempt for Matt Damon and Ben Afleck - in this film I enjoy the dynamic they present.     There's fan service abound (amusing stripper scene), and demon made entirely of pooh, Angels with big wings, and unlikely hilarious prophets.     There's a lot of satire, ie George Carlin as a Catholic Bishop, and clever discussion of religion, what it means, and how it's been twisted over the years. There's also a lot of focus on meaning and symbolism, but not enough to bore to lose the audience.     Very simple, witty conversations, great story, and hilarity all make Dogma an excellent film. Check it out!
B000VI04HK|5.0|This rocks from start to finish. I've waited a long time for a live REM cd. My only option to this point was a scattering of live tracks compiled from itunes. If you are looking for Greatest Hits Live, this may not be for you. While it does have many so called hits, abscent is Stand and a few others I would have liked to hear. However REM has never been a band to fit into the Greatest Hits format. Sound is perfect and crisp. Now for the rant. I have to disagree with another reviewer however. Our current administration deserves to be bashed. This great country has a government that seems to be committed to self destruction and it continues year after year. Our political leaders are a disgrace and do not deserve to be in a position of running the USA. REM, Springsteen, Jackson Browne and the like promote messages denouncing the things our government does that will destroy this nation. I for one am glad they stand up and spread the message. These are our spokespeople. Maybe one day our so-called leaders will hear what is said and make some changes. Until then we can continue as we are, on a downward spiral of self destruction, where we care more about fixing other countries than we do about fixing our own. If we want to play the big brother ticket, lets be a big brother to our own brothers and sisters. Want to stop terrorisim? We have big expensive airplanes which drop bombs. Use them! Well that was my rant. Thanks for reading. Buy the REM Live CD and play it loud!
B000P0J0G0|5.0|A Bit of Fry and Laurie was, and still is, a sketch show like no other. Sketches were often abandoned with a fourth-wall break, because there was no other way out. Big laughs were often put off in lieu of a series of quick-witted verbal exchanges; the amount of word play is almost exhausting, and you really don't catch most of it until the third or fourth time through. It's the only sketch comedy show I know that gets better each time you watch it, making it fully worth buying in a set like this. My only complaint about the set is its presentation; realizing that A Bit of Fry and Laurie doesn't have a huge fan base in the United States, the package design is simply the four individual seasons put into a slip case. It works great, and I don't really have any complaints about that, but I would think it a better use of materials to have used slim cases or a fold-out case, like Lost or Heroes.  Otherwise? Brilliant material from two brilliant men.

B00011D1RC|5.0|Perhaps the greatest assemblage of acting talent ever seen  in one film. Yet,again, millions of supposed \\"movie addicts\\" have never even heard of this movie, much less seen it! It's been reviewed positively to the hilt over the years, yet the basic ignorance seems to be building.Just like Latin, history seems to have become a \\"dead language\\", interesting only to hopeless reactionaries. Director  Goulding had none of the color, sight tricks, or background music available in 2007, but the character of the story and man's weaknesses and prejudices will always be topical. See the film before time runs out on you.
B000TJBNFI|5.0|On October 2nd, 2007, MGM released Misery - Collector's Edition on DVD. This DVD edition features a newly remastered video and audio. It has been said that this is a brand new never before released on DVD print of the film. The film is presented in its orignal aspect ratio of 1.85:1, a fullscreen version is not offered on this edition. This edition features 2 audio commentaries, both are bland and don't offer much in the way of info. There are many silent spots and isn't really worth the listen. It also features 7 featurettes, only one worth actully checking out. The 'Misery Loves Company' featurette talks to the actors and filmmakers about how this film came to be. Other features on this disc are 2 theatrical trailers. Personally I feel they skimped on the bonus material and had they given this release a little more time then it would have been a much better release. But I would recommend picking this up if you own the previous edition based on the updated video & audio alone.
B00000637V|5.0|I've spent the last five years of my life hearing from others that this album is a depressing, disturbing masterpiece. I finally bought it, and this is truly Lou Reed's finest hour. As is often pointed out about this album, the lyrics are brilliant. Reed tells stories with an eye for dirt and mire that few others come close to possessing. It's a thrilling read as well as a great listen.  As a consequence, though, the music behind the words is usually overlooked. I've never read a review of Berlin that made a point of how truly remarkable the music is. Some of these songs are absolutely astounding in their musical crafting. The chord progressions still sound fresh, the guitar parts are simple but perfect, and the melodies are the work of a master craftsman. Truly a brilliant album, in every sense.
0440419514|4.0|Phillip Pullman creates a wonderful story full of vivid characters.  You easily fall for Lyra and the premise of the story and its parallel worlds is fascinating.  He touches some serious questions and concepts; religion and social responsibility among them, while blurring lines between what we have been trained to see as good and evil in a way that you can easily follow. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I felt that the last installment, The Amber Spyglass may have been a bit rushed. Maybe I just didn't want it to end...? Overall I am thrilled that I finally found this series! One my favorite series!
B000QXDEDG|5.0|As a huge fan of Gerard Butler,I see all of his movies.I didn't think that I would love this movie as much as I did.I was lucky to view it first on an IMAX screen.It is so beautifully filmed.I love the way the battle scenes were slowed down and sped up.I hated to see it end.Gerard gave an outstanding performance.I followed the production from day one and I know how much blood,sweat and tears went into it.Lena Headey was so good,actually all performances were great.The movie had a dreamlike quality about it.Also,the musical score fit the movie perfectly.Great movie!!
0060763280|5.0|I got the book on 3 CDs two years ago after attending Harv Ekers free 3 day seminar.    I had just moved across country with no clients or connections.  This great energetic audiobook narrated by the author has made a great difference in my life.    Since practicing what I learned from this book I have attracted tons of hollywood celebrities, high paying jobs working directly with world leaders, calls from Oprah, several meeting with Paris Hilton (as a hair extensions consultant for one of her companies), and now I have attracted billionaire investors for my new school!    I highly recommend this book.  Harv and company, thank you, thank you, thank you!
B0000931OG|5.0|It's pretty well documented at this point; Graham Coxon left blur in the early stages of recording Think Tank, but the band soldiered on. Etc., etc. You've probably read that in a bunch of these reviews already. That's not really important.  What is important is the fact that Think Tank is a remarkable album. A lot of fans were not happy with the direction the band took for 13, an equally as brilliant if less focused album, and most of them were not assuaged by Think Tank. It's too bad, because they're missing out on a great sonic experience. The album takes a few spins to really show it's colors, requiring a patience many people aren't willing to provide it with. From the opening beats of \\"Ambulance,\\" to the heavy bass of \\"Jet,\\" to the closing glory of \\"Battery In Your Leg,\\" it's a great, varied listening experience. \\"Battery In Your Leg\\" may be one of the best songs of the decade; I've never heard a guitar used like that before, and, regrettably, don't think I ever will again. Graham Coxon's last contribution to the blur canon is a great one.  Again, an excellent album. Very different from everything else blur has done, but, in a manner not so different from the rest of their albums, it rewards patience and multiple listens. Great stuff.
B000EOTAM6|4.0|Though the movie does not live up to the original cartoon shorts that used to come on MTV's liquid television, it is better than I though it would be.
0783225849|5.0|In my personal opinion Psycho is truly one of scariest and suspense filled movies of all time. What more can you ask. A woman accused of stealing 40 thousand dollars...the infamous shower scene...a hotel proprietor gone beserk. It's a classic! Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins clicked in this 1960 Hitchcock thriller! Believe me once you see it you'll never take a shower again!!
B000HIVQD0|4.0|I recently gave this reissue a listen.  For starters, as other reviewers have noted, the Pretenders first five LP's have sorely needed to be updated and remastered, and for this I give Rhino kudos for answering that call.  I have some issues with the process, however.  First, I agree with other reviewers that the packaging should be improved.  While I am somewhat biased against digipaks, my real issue is that the CD's on this release must be tucked into the cardboard packaging (like a vinyl record) and are difficult to remove.  I think the digipak design could have been kept intact but a clear \\"holder\\" should have been used for the discs.  I also think the remeastering is good but some of the tracks seemed to be missing an edge that I recall from the vinyl.  \\"Kid\\" and \\"Brass In Pocket\\" seem OK but some of the others seem to be missing some punch.  After listening to the bonus disc, I felt disappointed that buyers are forced to commit to paying the extra price for a double CD.  Its nice to have \\"Cuban Slide\\" and \\"Porcelain\\" from the 'Extended Play' EP and the live versions of \\"Precious\\" and \\"Tattooed Love Boys\\" are worthwhile, but this disc is too heavy on demos which are not that spectacular.  I would much rather have more live tracks from one of their concerts from 1980-81.  The bonus disc clocks in at under one hour which also leaves me scratching my head.  I would rather have a one disc LP with a handful of bonus tracks (like what was done on the one-disc reissue of 'Learning to Crawl') or a double CD with a generous helping of live material (like the 'Pretenders II' reissue) than what is presented here.  Another oversight is the live version of \\"Precious\\" on the bonus disc is not the one from the 'Extended Play' EP.  The version on this release was recorded in March 1980 while the EP version was recorded in New York in August of that year.  Also, the bonus disc on 'Pretenders II' omitted the B-side \\"in The Sticks\\" (a Martin Chambers instrumental) presumably because of space constraints.  In contrast, the bonus disc on 'Pretenders' does not have space constraints and the track could easily have been included to allow listeners a complete offering of the band's 45 and vinyl releases.  While this CD still offers good material, I think the reissues of 'Pretenders II' and 'Learning to Crawl' are superior in terms of the decisions on track selection.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I bought this DVD for my wife, as she had heard them on TV and really enjoyed them. But when I sat down to watch it with her I enjoyed it so much that I made her watch it again with me. Their harmony is so smooth that even when they are singing a capella you at first think the orchestra is still playing. Their harmonic version of Over the Rainbow is so magnificent that Judy Garland will be spinning in her grave at 500 rpm!
0743486285|5.0|Riveting, raw and brutally honest.  There is NOTHING  in this book that glamorizes drug addiction.  I disagree with the reviewer who stated of the book that \\"it is simply a self-loathing pity party.\\"   I believe that Mr. Sixx' point was to demonstrate, in a quite uncensored manner, how pitiful and self destructive his lifestyle was, LOOKING AT IT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE SOBRIETY HE NOW HAS.  One prominent feature of addicts is DENIAL. This book stands as a testament to Mr. Sixx' having addressed his problems and relinquishing his denial about his self destructive behavior.  The story also provides HOPE to others that no matter how low you've gone, there is the opportunity to change your life.  As far as the idea of this book being \\"a how to manual\\" for a future addict, I can't imagine anyone in his/her right mind wanting to pursue these kinds of behaviors after reading this book.  Quite the contrary, I'd bet they'd be thinking twice after reading the grotesque details of substance abuse.  Mr. Sixx is to be commended both regarding his sobriety and his willingness to air his dirty laundry to the world in the hopes of diverting others from the path he took.  It would also be a great addition to the material presented to hear more about his experiences of achieving and maintaining sobriety.
B00000JTB2|5.0|This one is a must have for all blues guitar aficionados. Albert King's incredible string bending technique and the unique sound he gets out of \\"Lucy\\", his beloved Gibson Flying V, is precious.  Of course SRV is at his prime here in 1983, taking off with solos as Albert yells his encouraging \\"Go Ahead\\" to Little Stevie.  This is great stuff, I only wish a DVD was available.
B000002952|5.0|From the opening bars of the beautiful \\"Con Los A&ntilde;os Que Me Quedan\\" (translation:  \\"With the Years I have Left\\"), the luscious and seamless sounds of Gloria Estefan's heavenly music on MI TIERRA (MY HOMELAND) fill my heart with tenderness and longing.  This wonderful ballad provides just a little taste of the range and brilliance of the music of Cuba, the country of Gloria Estefan's soul and rich heritage.  How lucky are we that Estefan chose to share the music of her heart with us.<br /><br />We hear a little bit of everything, from son montuno (a variation on the son, a typical Afro-Cuban rhythm) on \\"Si Senor! Es Mi Son!\\" to montuno on \\"Montuno\\" (another rhythmic traditional type of music whose influence is often heard in salsa, and transcends nationality, rooted in its uptempo beat).  The lyrics in these pieces (translated into English) are pure poetry.  They are filled with rich romantic imagery, passion, longing, pain and joy.  Several were penned by Estefan and husband Emilio.  They include \\"Mi Tierra (My Homeland),\\"  \\"No Hay Mal Que Por Bien No Venga (Out of All Bad, Some Good Things Come)\\" and \\"Hablemos El Mismo Idioma (Let's Speak The Same Language).\\"  What's more, Gloria and Emilio Estefan had the beautiful concept of inviting (in their words on the CD jacket) \\"All-Star Latin Musicians\\" to participate.  This includes the legendary bass player Israel Lopez \\"Cachao,\\" flautist Nestor Torres, and Jon Secada (who co-wrote \\"No Hay Mal Que Por Bien No Venga\\" with Gloria and Emilio, and Cachao).<br /><br />This is, for me, some of the best music I have ever heard from Gloria Estefan's repertoire.  This album is truly in a class by itself and I really think it's essential for any Latin Music collection.
B000VI04HK|5.0|The guy below who spout's forth about the politic's in music is as verbose and irrelevant as the muscians who do-  REM have always mixed the 2-as have the Beatles,and U2-  are you so small minded that you can't get over that...?  Like the poet's of old, these musicians are merely reflecting the views of a large number of people-  but  if you can't be bothered to listen to other people's view's -    just listen to the beautiful music,and roll with it.
B000069HKH|5.0|one of his best and that's really saying something of course. 5/5. the whole album is a highlight.
B000VS6P64|4.0|When it comes to making great R&B music these days, we really don't seem to have the feeling that true soul & its essence carried over the years. For acts like Patti LaBelle, Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, they've all made really good records, but the music industry and fans seemed to be more eager into rap & hip hop acts like 50 Cent and Jay-Z. For a definitive crooner like Luther Vandross, his music seems to keep lovers everywhere wishing they had more from him. It has been 2 years since his devistating death, and many people who've been in the hearts of sensual soul are still listening to his sexy voice, and that can be said well in his first ever career-spanning box set.<br /><br />Love Luther, is the 2007 box set showcasing Luther Vandross through his delightful 3 decades of true sensual soul. The collection includes great tracks that were remastered well and true to what his voice carried over a lifetime. The collection includes great tracks as classic Luther standards like Any Love, the somber and mellow Dance With My Father, Take You Out, Stop To Love, Power Of Love/Love Power, to his classicly conjured duets with Mariah Carey on Endless Love, Destiny's Child lead singer Beyonce' with The Closer I get To You, and legends like Dionne Warwick with How Many Times Can We Say Goodbye. The collection also includes live rendiditions of A House Is Not A Home, Searching, and the Lady Is A Tramp with the legendary Frank Sinatra.<br /><br />Although the box set spans very well, there are a few disadvantages to this collection. The first one is that the collection doesn't keep the tracks in chronological order, which might confuse new listeners, as well as die hard fans. the other problem is that the album does overlook a few great songs that could've been displayed here like Going In Circles, Think About You from Dancing With My Father, and other great tracks.<br /><br />All in all, Love, Luther still remains a remarkable box set that is worth the heart and the soul from a legendary crooner. While the collection could've been fixed up a little, it still remains a shining box set that is worth the money for anyone who needs a little love from a late angel. Luther Vandross was. and always will be one of a kind, and I really recommend Love, Luther. It is a great buy.<br /><br />Album Cover: B+<br /><br />Songs: B+<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Remastering: A-<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+er.

1594489505|5.0|I could not even imagine what the women of Aphganistan go through until now.  Wonderfully written book as well ans \\"The Kite Runner\\".
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I have not even seen the musical production (YET, although I really hope to!) but the music from the soundtrack is amazing.  The quality of the lead voices is very high.  The jacket to the soundtrack has all the words to all the songs.  Would highly recommend it!
B00005JOHC|5.0|I bought this for my husband for his birthday as he is a huge 'Men Men Men' fan and he loved it.  We had missed most of the first season as we didn't start to watch the show till the season was almost over.  The first episodes are hilarious and will keep you in stitches as you watch how Charlie, Alan and Jake come to live together and start to become a family.  If you are a Men fan, you won't be disappointed.  Hopefully the 2nd season on DVD will be available soon.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|This is the perfect finale to a brilliant but canceled show. Highly recommended to anyone who likes intelligent sci-fi and well realized worlds and characters.
0385336810|2.0|I LIKE THE AUTHOR BUT THIS BOOK WAS BORING . . . I NEVER FINISHED IT, COULDN'T EVEN TELL YOU WHAT IT WAS ABOUT!<br /><br />DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Fantastic show I should have made time to watch sooner. Smart, well-written, and featuring a cast with almost supernaturally good chemistry, FOX clearly didn't understand exactly what sort of treasure they had in their hands.
0385486804|5.0|I was'nt sure if this book was up my alley. turns out i read the thing in record time. If you ever wanted to explore the outdoors withour watching the Discovery channel, this is your book. Real life story about a guy who did just that. can't wait to see the movie.
B000UJBYD8|2.0|I don't usually feel compelled to write album reviews but in this case I feel I have no choice - and that's not a good thing.  I'm a huge Cult fan and I'm hugely disappointed.  This must be addressed right to the top - Ian and Billy - listen up:    You need to salvage this thing before it's too late.  First, find the unmastered, unmmixed recordings.  Next, lookup Bob Rock's phone number and give him a call.  When Bob answers, say something like this \\"Bob, we're sorry we didn't hire you in the first place and now we have a real mess on our hands.  Please fix it.\\" Now Bob will probably ask for alot of money.  That's ok, pay him, he's worth every penny (or pence...whatever you guys have over there in London).  Did you hear what Bob Rock did with Motley Crue?  I once heard the demos for Dr. Feelgood before old Bobby worked his magic.  Holy cow! Bob Rock can take a pile of dog crap and mold it into a shiny, gold nugget.    Billy - Go pull one of your Les Pauls out of the closet and crank up the Marshall.  We need you to rock.  I don't know what you were trying to do on this album.  Guitar solos are a good thing.    Ian - You don't really sound like yourself.  I'm wondering if it was the time you spent with The Doors.  The ghost of Jim Morrison strikes, he's cursing you from the grave!  The Doors strike twice - first they create a bunch of crappy music and then the ghost of Jim Morrison ruins your voice.  I never liked The Doors and I like them even less now.  Thanks Jim Morrison, you schmuck.
B00008972S|5.0|Here's a classic musical about a star-crossed lovers (i.e. Romeo and Juliet) in the gang-world of New York. The Special edition consist of a script book and the DVD special regarding the movie.<br /><br />This is a good movie to revisit some memories.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|A wonderful series!  The artwork is enjoyable and the episodes are a joy to watch.  Each new viewing shows minor details missed during previous viewings.  The series as a whole has a wonderful space-cowboy feel.  Clint Eastood Western meets Star Trek only with deeper and more intense plotlines.
B000000WHX|4.0|If you are looking for a great cd to listen to than look no further than Massive Attack's \\"Blue Lines\\". My personal favorites on the album have to be Daydreaming and One Love. This CD is a must have for any true fan.
B000TSIK14|1.0|I have been a true fan of the Scorps since I was in 6th grade and I first heard Virgin Killer.  I lost my love for them after Crazy World when things seemed to fall apart for them.  After reading reviews on this new album, I had to pick it up.  WHAT A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!! This album is weak at best. There are NO great riffs. Nothing here sticks in your head as rocking.  These guys are trying to update their sound, but they should stick with rocking out, not trying to fit in. If you are a real fan, then please spare your ears this bloody mess.
0790729369|5.0|This movie was exceptionally good.  I have watched it several times!  Must see!
B000002J09|4.0|So as everyone who loves rockandroll knows this is a great album. Hands down . Except that I think there is one problem, that is just get really old really fast. Becareful and dont listen to it too much too fast.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I took a chance with this one as I hadn't previously seen it when I ordered it. It has quickly become my 2 year olds 2nd favorite movie to watch (2nd to Finding Nemo). This is one that I also enjoy watching with her and we watch it over and over. I love that it shows monsters in the closet as being friendly monsters with fears of their own. My daughter will sit and watch this movie in length and actually pay attention. Great addition to her movie library.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|The movie has a big problem in that it is not involving as  PLANET TERROR, and seems misogynistic.    The flow of the film seems sluggish, and the events unrewarding. There's no real big pay off. And the lead character is a sleazebag who isn't interesting and his moral core nonexistant.
B00005JM02|5.0|My two year old loves Nemo and so do I. I actually enjoy watching this with my toddler over and over again. The animation with the bubbly, fat, colorful fishies is awesome. The colors are so beautiful. The voices are so, so adorable. My baby loves her some Nemo and Dori. I do recommend fast forwarding the part when Nemo's mom gets eaten by the shark (they don't actually show this but it's implied) and when Nemo gets caught by the diver. However, for the rest of the movie you can sit back with your little ones and prepare to be delighted.
B000E1MTY0|5.0|This is movie would make the original comic book author proud. The HD DVD in movie features were helpful and interesting. Christian Bale makes Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, and George Clooney look like hollywood clowns. Batman is the only hero without superpowers and the movie does a good job of showing how an average joe billionaire can become the batman.
B00006LJ6X|5.0|It was just as I thought it would be.  Delivery of the product was flawless and the product was outstanding.
B000002I69|5.0|I had and lost track of this disk several years ago.  Hearing Gerry Mulligan and Dave Brubeck on the same bandstand is a never-to-be-repeated experience.  The disk includes yet another rendition of the oft-repeated \\"Take Five,\\" but with the interface between Gerry Mulligan, Paul Desmond and the audience, the performance ranks with Benny Goodman's \\"Sing, Sing, Sing!\\" at Carnagie Hall in 1938 as \\"The One to Hear.\\"
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Thankfully the terrible Batman movie streak has come to an end. I wish to ignore every Batman movie since Batman and Batman Returns. As far as I'm concerned those original 2 and this version are the only ones worth watching. Bale is the best Batman, with all due respect to Keaton.
1416523359|1.0|When I get a new Stephen King book, I check out of the world for a while... I just read, read, read from the opening paragraph until the last word. I am spellbound by his books. An electric connection. I LOVE Stephen King. Can't put one down.    I took this one back to the library without finishing it. I kept TRYING to read it. I kept hoping it would get better.     I don't think he wrote this one.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I just bought this DVD as my son loves animals and to go the zoo.  We saw the movie and he was so happy. I am planning his 4th birthday party and got inspired from the movie to do a jungle animal themed party and have the DVD as part of the party.  I am thrilled to see an old Disney Classic be available again!!
B0001CNRSE|4.0|After watching this movie I was very suprise to see how amazing it was and iI would recommand this movie to everyone of different age groups.  Honey (Jessica Alba) is a wonderful hip hop choreographer who tries to work her way up to the top with her talented moves.  Working at the center teaching her hip hop class keeps her motivated to try and be one of those hip hop dancers that is in the videos.  While on this journey she gets her big break of meeting a producer that can get her in the industry of music, but things does'nt go as planed.  After her ended relationship with her producer she has no hope of ever geting in the music business again but she does'nt let that bring her down.  Hopeing to get her own dance studio with the help of her boyfriend she rents a building and does a dance charity to help herself and the people in the community.  With all the trouble she had to go through she worked her way to the top with the help of family and friends and open up her own dance studio and also meet hip hop atrists on the way.      This is a good movie that can help motivate you and to help you realize the only person that can keep you down is yourself, so follow your dreams.                                               - Valeria G.
0743486285|4.0|This is one of my favorite books.Being a musician and a recovering addict myself,I saw a lot of my own reflections in Nikki's journals.This is a very brave and honest story of the grip that drug addiction can have.No matter how much success you have,you can still hate the guy in the mirror.Nikki was one of my childhood heroes,and I modeled a lot of my life from his.When I read this book,I saw how much he struggled in his own life.I personally know heroin addiction,and I also know how great life is without drug abuse.I recommend this book for everyone who wants to see what rock n' roll life really is.Maybe this story can help you make your own choices and save your life.
0757302661|5.0|After reading this book (and several others about childbirth methods), this was the one I chose to focus on, and attend classes on.  I haven't given birth yet, so I don't know for sure how effective it'll be!  But it's a good read, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a childbirth method.  Focuses on relaxation, and connecting with your baby and your own body both during pregnancy and during childbirth.  I found that \\"hypnosis\\" as presented in this book is much different than I had imagined!
0743486285|5.0|This was one of the best auto bio I've read. Counldn't put it down from the time I opened it. If you have had or know someone with a addiction this is a real eye opener. Must read!
0743270754|5.0|Fast and reliable service, the book was in excellent condition. I would definitely order again from the seller.
B000I5Y9G8|5.0|Peter Hammill wrote this album after his wife left him. It is a sincere account of his feelings at that time, his questions on himself, on humanity, on what went wrong... This kind of album can be ridiculous when it's by a lesser artist, but Peter Hammill is a talented one, and it's hard not to be moved by this album.
B000002MTU|5.0|This album is awesome.  Lots of old blues standards, it's very well produced.  If you appreciate the blues or old Clapton you will love this album!
B000MIVCX4|5.0|This GPS is awesome!!!  I have struggled with trying to interface handheld GPS to my laptop for a couple of years.  I live aboard a sailboat in the Caribbean using navigation software to plan my passages and have been frustrated trying to use my handheld GPS input which resulted in continual problems.  That has all been changed using this new GPS and couldn't be happier with it's ease of installation and awesome performance.  It picks up the signal below at my nav station, aquires quickly and performs without causing any problems with my computer.  I have tried several systems and this unit outperforms them and I cannot recommend this unit highly enough, you will not be sorry...
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Our entire family thoroughly enjoyed this film. It is funny, witty, and, for once, we have a movie that isn't preachy about anything. It's just pure, completely unrealistic fun. The animation is awesome. Go see this movie or get the DVD!
0399208534|4.0|Great book to read children teaching them the life cycle of the caterpillar. Beautiful illustrations. Is a favourite with my children.
B000002MVT|3.0|Although the CD is good, and I love ZZ Top, it is deceptive because one foot in the blues is not all blues songs: i.e. HiFi Mama, She Loves My Automobile, Heavan Hell or Houston, If Only I could Flag Her Down, etc. These are a mixed bag of Pop/Rock songs thrown in.  With a title of one foot in the blues, I expect to hear my wife left me, my dog (who has one tooth) bit me, I ain't go no money and the rent is due.  This clearly fell short of a pure blues CD.
0446693804|5.0|This remains one of my favorite books by Nicholas Sparks -the master of spinning tearjerkers.  Sure, many of his books do follow a familiar formula, but for me, there is something different about this one.  Perhaps it has to do with the main characters, caught between the innocent trappings of youth and standing on the brink of adulthood. Some may think the love story of Landon and Jamie is sappy, hard-to-comprehend.  They wonder how Landon, a self-absorbed kid with no purpose, could fall for sweet, ordinary, Bible-toting Jamie.  Did I mention there's a strong Christian theme here?  Not only is Jamie the daughter of a Baptist preacher, she outwardly lives her faith on a daily basis.  That's what sets her apart from her peers, and that is what ultimately hooks Landon.  Never underestimate the power of God.  He can do marvelous things through His servants.  This is not just a love story, but one of complete life transformation.  I was fascinated at the personal changes in this young man as he struggled to find his true potential in life.  This was one of those rare books that made me reflect on many things long after I had turned the last page......the love of God, the natural cycle of life and death, but mostly, our purpose here on Earth.
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|The whole CD is excellent.  I would give it six stars if I could.  The remastering added life to the CD.  Gutsy blues, raw rock, and fantastic musicianship.  If you buy one ZZ Top CD, hands down, this is the one.
B000UGG3A0|5.0|This Album is AWESOME I discovered the DropKick Murphy's from the DEPARTED soundtrack, I will buy more of there stuff!!
B000P2A256|5.0|Great second CD from a new band!   A must have CD, all tracks are worth  a listen!
B00005Y228|5.0|I can't stop listing to this album... is just awesome, i love it from the first time i heard the most succesful kylie's single of all the time (Can't get you out of my head)... all the fever's song are great, including the 4 singles.. all the songs are sexy, pop, dance and make you wanna go to a dancefloor...

0143036556|5.0|The author did research into the ancient societies to come up with some lessons for our own future.  Very interesting reading.
0452282152|5.0|I must admit that many times I've hesitated whether this book was worth a shot or not. I've heard excellent reviews about it - which didn't seduce me as much, due to the simple fact that a good book isn't necessarily a knock-of-your-feet book in my world. And so I decided to give this book a shot. What was there to miss?    During the reading I remember flipping to the cover now and then - looking at the portrait of Griet. A sixteen year old maid who has come to work for a remarkable painter - Jan Vermeer. Chevalier lets you into the world of this young and mysterious girl - a deeper look on how innocence turns into wisdom. One of the characters I found myself the most withdrawn to was Vermeer. His mysterious ways, secretive actions - his unknown purposes. I found myself wondering about him even after finishing the book.     My advice to those who mean to read this book: Take a good look at Griet's portrait, read her expression - when you'll read the book, you'll understand the importance of this one single picture.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Rattatouille has got to Pixar's greatest work. from plot to characters to quality of animation this movie outshines in all categories. A must-have for anyone.
0618680004|5.0|Dawkins covers all the bases and does so in an engaging and provocative style.  Whether you believe in God or not, if you have an open mind, you'll want to read this book.  I only wish it had come out when I was writing my novel, Neitherworld (also on Amazon), since I write about all-powerful aliens who are NOT God.  Dawkins is a scholar, though as he rightly points out, there is no need to delve into arcane religious squabbles until there is proof the God of the bible actually exists.  He does use the bible to good effect, however, in showing how God is a spoiled, egomanical, bullying, egotistical brat (or words to that effect).  It is a harsh indictment of religion, but a fair treatment given today's holy warriors on all sides.
0802130208|5.0|Several years ago a co-worker told me the name of this book and added simply, \\"it is my favorite book\\".  I read it just because of that, knowing nothing else about the book.  It is now my favorite book.  I re-read it about every other year.  Read it!
B000066C6Z|3.0|I love this one! it's a classic! I saw it a looong time ago and just had to get it, to bad it doesn't come with more subtitles have some friends from abroad that liked it but did't get all of it, they're english wasn't that good lol, still I loved the movie!!!
B000URDEB0|1.0|I knew when Tarja got fired that the band would change radically but not this badly.  The new lead singer is whiney and has a weak voice.  It's not her fault as they picked her.  I assume Tuomas found her attractive and hired her based on that alone.  The music itself is good and Marco Hietala's voice is better than ever; he should quit Tarot and just sing full time for Nightwish and they should get rid of the current singer.  I purchased the collectors edition with the bonus orchestral disk which is just minus the vocals.  Frankly the orchestral disk is the only saving grace.  This is most likely the last Nightwish album that I'll buy.  They seem to have gone the way of Metallica.  First album was good, second and third albums were amazing, fourth album was o.k. and everything afterwards was a steaming pile of festering camel dung (\\"Once\\" not included).  Hei Hei Nightwish voi vittu perkele satana!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|it's so good this series with 'region all' code. i hate to see 'unknown' about region code. coz i hv a player with code C. what's more, that's easy to exchange  movie with region all with my friends.
0805079831|5.0|I learned more from the first 25 pages of that book than I did from all the books I read  during the 50 previous years combined, and I consider myself well-read!!! The Shock Doctrine is an EXCELLENT, well-researched book!!!
B000026OW3|5.0|This 11 CD set is absolutely fabulous.  Artur Rubinstein was a great pianist, and he was at his best with Chopin.  You simply will not hear better performances of Chopin than these.  That is not just *my* opinion; he is widely regarded as one of the greatest interpreters of Chopin of all time.  Just do a quick online search if you doubt this, and look at reviews of his other CD releases of Chopin pieces here at Amazon.com.    This is all of the pieces of Chopin that Rubinstein recorded, though it is not all of the recordings he did of Chopin (he recorded some pieces more than once; many of his earlier mono recordings are not included), and it is not all of the pieces that Chopin wrote (because Rubinstein never recorded all of what Chopin wrote).  If one wants all of the works of Chopin, one should still buy this set, but one would need to buy a few other CDs of other people performing the few pieces of Chopin that Rubinstein never recorded.      10 of the 11 discs were recorded in the late 1950's & 1960's in good quality stereo sound (though obviously not as high fidelity as is possible now).  The last disc was recorded in the 1940's, so the sound is not great, and is mono.  Nevertheless, it is still listenable, and the performances are still superb.    It comes with a nice, informative, multi-lingual booklet.  English is one of the included languages.    You should buy this set before they raise the price; it is great.  This set would be worth buying even if they charged normal retail prices for the CDs (which would be somewhere around $200 for this many discs).  I bought an earlier release of this set for around $100 some years ago, and was very happy with the deal.  (My brother bought a set of this release, so I know about this particular release, too, and that it includes a multi-lingual booklet, etc.)  At the price Amazon is currently selling it, buy before they change their minds and charge what it is really worth!    If you like Chopin, the only way you couldpossibly be disappointed with this is if you must have current state of the art sound quality, or you have deviant taste in how Chopin should be performed.  There simply is no other way you could be dissatisfied.
B000URDEB0|4.0|I agree with the previous reviewer, my kids heard this and said, thats Within Temptation, and I'm like no, that is the new Nightwish singer.  For me her voice is just a little off somehow.  I can't place it.  Not as precise and clear as Tarja.  Firing her was a big mistake.  Nightwish is great.  They need a great female singer.  This new girl is not her.
073933705X|5.0|I was a little apprehensive about reading this book, because of the subject matter, but after the first couple of pages, I was hooked. What a wonderful,yet haunting story. I ordered the CD and would recommend that for anyone who is always on the go and too busy to sit and read.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|It seems odd to write this, but one of the best things about this movie is the acting. I thought Stallone was amazing. The lines are great. The script is very, very good. That courtroom scene where Rocky argues for \\"the pursuit of happiness\\" and following one's dream, is to me one of the best statements I have ever seen in a movie, about what America is about and should be about (being able to pursue one's dream, and why should some arbitrary bureaucrat take that away ?).     The boxing is amazing. I felt like I was watching a real fight.     It seems odd to even write this, but I thought the film not only had good acting, but I loved the script and I loved the fight itself.
0893860220|5.0|Consume it slowly over time. A little bit goes a long way.  Nisargadatta comes across as far more patient than eye witness accounts usually describe him. Listen carefully to what he says and let it work on you.
B000RF7XZI|5.0|Simply a stunning transfer in High Def and a 5 outta 5 movie to boot!  You can't go wrong with this one :)
B000R7HY0K|1.0|This movie was not worth 20 bucks it's only redeaming feature was the scene with the first group of women and the ensuing car crash the rest of the film is boring overly talkative and a waste of time no wonder they didnt relase deathproof and planet terror together it would have ruined it
