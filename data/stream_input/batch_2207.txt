It has great graphics and I like the fact that I can move the buildings and people around as my town grows.  One minor disappointment is that some of the challenges require you to actually purchase things.  I wish that you could bypass those challenges so that they disappear from the list.

B0014Z4OQG|1.0|If those two words in the title of this review aren't enough to persuade anyone from watching this movie, keep reading.<br /><br />On July 4, 2007 I remember seeing this teaser trailer right before Michael Bay's \\"Transformers\\" film.  Like the other people sitting around me in the audience, I was wondering why there wasn't a title to the movie.  My first impression was that it looked like \\"Cloverfield\\" (as it later was revealed) would be Dead On Arrival in terms of a good movie.<br /><br />The movie involves a group of young actors (who simply can't act) dodging explosions, a giant hideous monster with parasites terrorizing New York City, filmed the entire time with a hand held camera.  It has no back story, no character development and no satisfying conclusion.  Let's be honest people, you CANNOT make a good movie with hand held cameras (not even just one camera for that matter), unforgettable characters and absurd dialog!<br /><br />Not even talented actors (Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks, Bruce Willis, etc.)  could save this movie much less make it more entertaining.  \\"Cloverfield\\" is an abomination (like the raging monster) and is simply unwatchable.
B009K0P10K|4.0|If you watched Season 1 and were on the edge of your seat through most of it, you'll enjoy Season 2 also.  I didn't think it was AS good as the first Season, just because it sort of took a bit of a spin into La Femme Nikita type of stuff.  At first, that felt a bit over the top to me.  But once I embraced it, I enjoyed the new plot twists and web of intrigue.
B00AEKFLOQ|5.0|Director Christopher Nolan brings his Batman movie series to an exciting conclusion with \\"The Dark Knight Rises.\\"  Warner Brothers has made up for past mistakes and disappointments with the Batman series from 1989 to 1997.<br /><br />For his portrayal of Bane as a cunning and physically intimidating villain, Tom Hardy did a remarkable job.  I believe he erased a lot of doubts fans may have had about how he would handle playing this role.  When first seen on film in that abominable \\"Batman and Robin\\" Bane was nothing more than a mindless idiot.  This time it was done right even though his costume is different from the comic books and animated series.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway has come a long way as an actress.  Her physical training more than paid off and she all but stole the show as the conniving Selina Kyle/Catwoman.  Even composer Hans Zimmer created an original, somewhat dark and seductive musical motif for the villainess with a song titled \\"May I Cut In\\".<br /><br />When I saw \\"Batman Begins\\" in 2005, I commented to my friends it was the Batman movie fans have been waiting for.  The combined talents of Director Christopher Nolan, Composer Hans Zimmer, a carefully selected cast of actors, actresses and crew have successfully created one of the greatest and most exciting movie series of all time.

B009JZVT70|5.0|This is an excellent series, I love how they weave the magical past lives and stories with the current day ones.  The special effects are state of the art with the fantasy world rich, colorful and quite believable.  The villains are not completely evil and have some humanity to them that gives them depth and makes them sympathetic at times.  All in all, an excellently written and in my opinion very imaginative series, I am enjoying season 2 as much as I did season 1.

B008CLI4N4|5.0|There's so much information available about Game of Thrones that the newcomer to it may feel overwhelmed.  So here's a capsule review intended for  people who have heard of this immensely popular series but have never read the books or seen any episodes, and are wondering if it's worth their while to start watching the DVDs.<br /><br />Game of Thrones is the first book of a heroic fantasy series by American author George R. R. Martin.  The books, like Lord of the Rings, form an extended epic set in a detailed alternative world.  This world is more or less medieval in atmosphere, and includes a certain magical element:  sorcery is effective to a limited extent, and there are actual dragons and other creatures considered legendary in our own world.  The plot concerns the intrigues and wars of various aristocratic families maneuvering for power.<br /><br />The HBO series is considered by most fans of the book to be a faithful adaptation.  It has also been highly and justly praised for its quality as entertainment - personally, I think it is the best television show ever made.  The acting is of a very high quality, with most of the characters being perfectly cast, and the realization of the alternative world in its landscape, architecture, and costume is superb.  And the story is told about as clearly as can be managed with such a complicated plot.  Special effects are used relatively sparingly for this sort of production, but when they are used, they are absolutely convincing.<br /><br />So with all that, what's not to like?  Well, this series, good as it is, isn't for everyone.  For one thing, it pushes the envelope with sex and violence - it doesn't go beyond what's currently considered acceptable in adult TV, but it goes right up to the edge.  And there is plenty of adult language, sometimes of the bluntest kind.  It also is so complicated, with so many characters, and so much backstory presented by references in the current story, that people who haven't read the books may find it difficult to follow at first.  The DVD set has some informational inserts and special features that will help, but many beginning viewers will find they have to beyond those to other information on the internet or in spin-off books in order to sort out who's who and what's happening.  And the story, unlike some other heroic fantasies, is generally not very romantic or whimsical.  There are few unambiguously good characters, many of the ones who seem most positive get killed off, and the overall atmosphere might be described as grim seriousness punctuated with grim humor.<br /><br />Recommendation:  if the characteristics mentioned above don't put you off, by all means watch these DVDs:  you'll probably find yourself rapidly becoming fascinated with them.  But be aware of what you are getting into.  And above all, don't let the fact that these are fantasies which include queens and dragons and sorcerers mislead you into thinking they are suitable for children.  You do not want your kids in the room when these are playing.ooks may find it difficult to follow at first.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I had a lot more hope in this novel than it delivered. Repetitive until ur crazy, poor to no knowledge of the real world of s&m's, kink. This writer faked her way through it all. Had the appeal of well-mannered college girl's &#34;vanilla&#34; fantasy. U don't even believe Gray is a real character, since his personality has but 2 facets to it. I'd like to read something by someone who has real knowledge of this lifestyle. This author just phoned in all in.

B003O86FMW|2.0|The reason why this is a cheap sequel in my books is because madame Collins did the SAME CRAP she did in the first one, as in CATNISS IS THROWN INTO THE ARENA AGAIN!!!!!!! While yes it is a different arena with different peole this is like all those useless and boring Friday the 13th sequels same thing happens different people. Also the ending is a failed cliffhanger that was done poorly, this one made me hesistant to buy #3.<br /><br />In short just know that all the creativity that went into the first one is gone, there were like 1 or 2 surprises that honestly you halfway see coming.
B00A655N8I|2.0|When this was announced a few months back, I was thrilled; it seemed like a nearly ideal cast by 2013 standards. I've wanted to hear Pape as Wotan since the first time I heard him more than fifteen years ago.  While I may not like everything that Kaufmann sings, Siegmund is a role tailor-made for his baritonal sound.  And Stemme was a pretty convincing Isolde for Janowski, so I looked forward to her Brunnhilde.<br /><br />Kaufmann and Stemme do not disappoint, but virtually everyone else does.  As Sieglinde, Kampe sings the notes, but sounds as though she's at the end of her rope vocally, so any interpretation goes out the window.  Petrenko (Hunding) and Gubanova are adequate, but no more than that.  But the biggest vocal disappointment is Pape.  He sounds bored, tired, and vocally indisposed - in short, like an old man.  It's hard to explain, because just a few days ago he sang a magnificent Gurnemanz at the Met; I wonder if he's just one of those singers who dislikes studio conditions and needs a real performance in front of a real audience.  I've seen him live several times and have been bowled over; I've heard virtually every one of his recordings, and have been disappointed by every one except for his Pogner for Solti (which was, of course, recorded live).<br /><br />And Gergiev's conducting is, in a word, awful.  There are lots of \\"moments\\" in Walkure, and in Gergiev's hands, they all pass by without making any impression.  I've never heard a less exciting Walk&uuml;renritt, and my favorite scene, the Wotan-Brunnhilde confrontation in Act 3, goes for absolutely nothing.  Wotan's Act 3 entrance should whip things up into a frenzy.  No wonder Pape sounds bored, uninterested, and uninteresting.  Solti always managed to bring great excitememt to such moments, but momentum could be a problem in slower, more reflective music.  With Gergiev, we get the worst of both worlds - missing the point of the \\"big moments\\", while still managing to lose all foward momentum during the slower music.  And the orchestra is no better than second rate.<br /><br />As for the sound, I must disagree with those who have raved about the sonics.  To my ears, listening to the SACD layer, the sound is dull, opaque, and lifeless.  This is SACD???  The sound is inferior to virtually every recording of Walkure since Solti's.  And did no one think about creating proper perspectives?  If I remember correctly, the Siegmund-Hunding battle is supposed to begin offstage, but here it happens front and center, right under our noses.  How can the two of them not see one another when they are audibly a few feet apart?  And why does Wotan have to say \\"Steh' Brunnhild\\" when he sounds as though he's close enough to grab her?<br /><br />I like the packaging - a nice slim, sturdy clambox without a lot of wasted space.  But who really cares about that when the music is treated like this?<br /><br />So one star for Kaufmann, one for Stemme - two stars is all that this one deserves.  It's a pity that they didn't transport this cast to Berlin for Janowski's cycle, which will undoubtably sound better and be better conducted.
B003G4W49C|1.0|How this is somehow getting a movie baffles me and annoys me greatly as a kid who is trying to finish editing his ow novel and hopefully publish it on amazon.<br />Enough about me though, this book keeps building up to a showdown with aliens called &#34;buggers&#34; (worse name ever, not even the slightest bit terrifying) which NEVER HAPPENS!!! You never even see one of these &#34;buggers&#34; and the climatic battle at the end left me sitting there saying WTF I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone who really does want to read this novel but by the time I got to the end I deleted this book.

B004XQYBA2|4.0|The game is well designed. Hands down one of the best sudoku game out there.<br /><br />Suggestions: add other puzzle games like futoshiki etc.  Also 2.49 may be too high.  0.99 or 1.49 might be attractive.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I really enjoy playing this. It is relaxing but also offers a bit of a challenge.  I love the feeling of accomplishment once you figure it out. Not too hard and not too easy. On average it takes me 5-10 minutes to figure out a puzzle .

0345537998|2.0|Some key points:<br /><br />1.  Anyone who is at all familiar with realspace travel knows that ZG (Zero Gee) is very bad for all the muscles and organ functions in the body, leading rapidly to degenerative atrophy with the potential for permanent and life threatening (irreversible) effects.  It is one of the main reasons, aside from power and air, that we are not going to Mars anytime soon.  Yet an entire cast of 'spinnerets' lives their entire lives in ZG and are uncomfortable to the point of non-functional outside it.  This includes the designated Old Woman sounding board who acts as a foil for the main character's supposed genius for most of the book.<br /><br />2.  One of the scenarios in the book deals with overpopulation on a planet with 39 odd billion people.  The conditional justification for this being a religious philosophy that if mankind doesn't create sufficient genetic diversity, he will not evolve towards godhead and from there, learn to abate the heat death of a universe that has expanded all it can.  The problem here being that, while large numbers of genetic codings do equate to large numbers of mutations (all things being equal in terms of genetic sweep vs. environmental drivers), most species only have a rough lifespan of approximately 1-2 million years anyway, before genetic diffusion leads to reproductive failure or species change anyway.  Breeding more idiots now will not change this relative fact of life on the timescale of multiple tens of billions of years before the 'end of everything'.<br /><br />3.  Tuf's solution to the overpopulation problem is to eventually provide a narcotically addictive plant whose pimple like carbuncles 'taste so good' that everyone will eat them without bothering to do the tests which reveal that it dramatically reduces male libido and female fertility to something like .01 of original function.<br /><br />The problem here is that the justification for this is the need for a 'population implosion' by which a technologically sophisticated (maximum genius to support all those hungry mouths) race would -lose-, in direct percentages, the equivalent from every cast.  Specifically, if the hyper intelligent whose numbers are seldom more than 5-8% of society would be hit the hardest because they are the fewest relative percentile group.  Since these are the people who keep the lights on, their lack of numeric presence would lead to famine and war and pestilence among the also rans -anyway- as society will not be able to sustain the technocracy without them.<br /><br />3.  Tuf's home is a giant ecological (environmental modification) ship.  Ignoring the stupidity of multi-month infectious diseases and various predatory animals being useful in an interstellar war defined by seconds of engagement time with gigaton yield nukes and high-fraction-of-light collisions between masses, the one thing you don't see Tuf doing is **Teraforming** in a manner that would bring not simply profitability but real gain to those struggling masses who are the center of almost medieval dramas (beast fighting among aristos and religious heresy by would be prophets among others, hardly subjects of interest for a people that have been wandering the stars for 1,000+ years...).  Indeed, the one time we are shown what happens when the -successful- party woos away the population from the idiocracy of absolutism to (robotics/automation enabled) 'something better' it immediately degrades to a duel of plagues with a less than interesting antagonist rather than something that explains what life in 1,500 years might really be like.<br /><br />A large part of this is inherent to the need to rapidly construct the myth of Tuf himself who comes across as less monastically pure and clever than dysfunctionally affected in his eccentricities and free to judge others based upon his protected position in the story.<br /><br />As stated, the attitudes taken towards religion and social mores are less pointed in their suggestedprimitivism than simplistic bordering on boorish in their depiction of barbarians in a high tech society.  If Tuf is that smart and the technologies suggested are that advanced then EVERYONE in the population should be equally clever and charming.  Instead, they are simply overbearingly stupid for the purpose of making the protagonist look smart.<br /><br />No one who was as primitive as the author depicts these people being, in their aesthetic tastes as associated belief systems, would ever listen to half the length of Tuf's highbrowed pedantism, they'd shoot him in the face and then discover that they'd screwed up.  Something that indeed happens to several of his erstwhile foes, but only among themselves.<br /><br />This is a book which reads fast because it has lost the balance between light hearted and air headed.  It might appeal to a specific kind of preteen adolescent.  But no one over the age of 10 will be taken in by it.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|This is the one show that I go out of my way to watch. I think that the casting is just perfect and I really enjoy the relationship between Beckett and Castle. These are characters that you really come to care about.

I find Jillian to be much more personable in this video than she is on the Biggest Loser show.  The workout is 25 minutes from beginning to end, and it will get your heartrate up with the cardio, as well as work your muscles with the weights.  I would recommend.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I've been playing this game since it first came out and I've loved every bit of it. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this game. Best part id, this game is free!
B00BESLHEA|3.0|Interesting characters using moves (and music) from all sorts of genres, but it spreads itself a bit thin. There are lots of 'cool guy' poses, flourishes, and funny looks that were not earned. It build ups to fights which then end after one or two exchanges.Several characters are killed off from a distance, rather than in combat.<br /><br />Worth renting.
B000095K7A|5.0|I'm just really confused that on the sticker, it quotes \\"colored vinyl\\" and I took the vinyl out and it's not coloured, it's just black. I'm not complaining about it or anything, just thought it'd be cool if it was really a coloured vinyl. Still an awesome record!

It is a good size, too. Not too small. Not too big.

If you still want the &#34;ultimate collection&#34; there is a code inside that gives you discounts for the other accessories that will come with it. Regardless, you won't miss anything. And about the movies, can't believe time flies so fast and that all three movies were all masterpieces especially Heath Ledger's performance. I remember critics are questioning about him portraying the joker and boy he blew our minds away. Giving us an ever lasting image what the joker really was and implementing it to his own craft was brilliant. Till this day, people still loves the joker through various fan art and parodies from television shows. Christopher Nolan vision of the Dark Knight brought us an image that we will never forget.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game but I can't update it.....but other than the not being able to update its a great game
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow! This book took new by surprise. At first I want sure about Dean. But boy did he just wrap me around his little finger. Such a great story. Pulls at your heart and makes you want to wrap your arms stood Sky and protect her. I just could not put this one down. This is by far a must read!!
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Beautiful and challenging. I love the variety of layouts and the challenge rounds. Very good app! I recommend this if you enjoy puzzles.
0062014536|3.0|Let me start off by first saying how EXTREMELY difficult it is for me to write this review. I feel like any thought or feeling I have could potential be a spoiler so I will try to keep this as brief as possible.<br /><br />The Delirium series has always been one of my favorites. I love the genre, wholeheartedly, and the premise of love as a disease is captivating. As those of you know who have read the series, it is well known for killer cliffhangers. Usually this might drive me mad but the way Oliver crafted them was spectacular and made me live on the edge of my seat for the next installment. I find myself in such a bittersweet moment of finishing this last book. When I started really getting into regular reading a couple years ago, Delirium was among the first and this is the first series I have finished that I have had to wait each year for an installment. I can't even describe how that feels. I am happy to have had the chance to read this beautiful series but incredibly sad to think that the journey with these characters is over.<br /><br />Now onto the book. Was Requiem everything I wanted in a finale? No. Was it still a good read? I think so. I really enjoyed the alternating points of view between Lena and Hana more than I expected, though in the beginning of course I just wanted Lena's, after the way we left off in Pandemonium. I think it was really important to see how things were for Hana on her end and how it all tied in to Lena's past as well with what could become of the future. Also, it was kinda cool to see things from someone who was 'cured'.<br /><br />I know what everyone really wants to know... Alex or Julian. Of course I can't answer that! The whole situation coming into this novel was a heartbreaking mess. I, personally, love both boys but was completely Team Alex. The thing with Requiem though, there is so much more going on than just the love triangle. There is a war brewing that takes center stage. I must convey my frustrations at times because part of me just wanted everything to be resolved with the boys right in the beginning. But what Oliver created was a complex situation between Lena/Alex and Lena/Julian. There was no way it could possible resolve so fast. I really had to reflect the gravity of the situation for Lena. That helped me get through a few times where I was so anxious and frustrated for resolution of the situation.<br /><br />The ending... I won't say much here. I think it fit with the writing style of the series leading up to it but if I am being honest, it didn't fully satisfy. This saddens me a great deal. I see the brilliance in it, but at the same time, I needed more closure. Perhaps my expectations of everything being tied up with a nice little bow were too high? That's possible. But I am not above begging for another book. :)<br /><br />I think it is important to note, I thoroughly wish I had reread both Delirium and Pandemonium before I started Requiem. At least Pandemonium. I did find myself a little confused at times with characters and situations and wish I had the past fresh on my mind.<br /><br />~Sara @ Forever 17 Booksse part of me just wanted everything to be resolved with the boys right in the beginning.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|I absolutely love this game! I have my granddaughter hooked hooked and my sister. We are all friends. The game does take some dedication but it is entertaining..and relaxing.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|What a great find! Love this disc and the feel that it gives. Highly recommend it for what it is!
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|The theme of this movie was to show all of us that we remain human with our ubiquitous urges regardless if we are handicapped.  The movie was tastefully done and well acted.  It made me feel real sympathy for those who cannot enjoy a &#34;normal&#34; life but who maintain a sense of humor and optimism while living a horribly restricted life.  I doubt if I convinced my Mormon friends to go see it, but I tried!  ( I live in Utah, duh!)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun and easy to play.  Meeting friends and adding them make it more fun.  Wish there were less pop ups.
B00BBI9WD6|4.0|A readable book in a readable series. No great ideas or philosophies but I usually don't need that. Simply medium quality readable Science Fiction. I will gradually read the rest of the series.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|Excelente alicacion super repido e intutivo una de las mejores calculadoras que he visto. escribes tal cual como si fura y papel y entiende toda tu escritura
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Great book. Really great book. I'm mentioning this book with just about everyone I talk to. I work in education and found many interesting ideas for working with students and co-workers.
B001DTUU7A|5.0|This movie is awesome! Katie the yak is my favorite and the behind the scenes is cool to see how the movie was made.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Easy to learn, enough challenge to remain interesting. Works well on the Droid bionic. Wish it had more levels; hoping developer adds more.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|My 2-year-old grandson had the Croup last week and was often tired. He loved watching \\"Despicable Me\\" on my Kindle because he could hold it on his chest. We watched it more than 10 times, and I never tired of it. I found myself laughing every time! When Gru announces he is going to STEAL THE MOON, I don't know how you can resist laughing. And the Minions=scene stealers
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Great character development. When TV tries to do this (modernize a old story line and characters) they usually mess it up and and make it superficial.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I personally don't like games with gems to buy etc.  I want something that I can just play. this game has a decent balance of both.  lots of content..
B009IF82SK|5.0|My husband and I are sqeeky new to Big Bang. Last summer, my daughter was visiting, and said they just HAD to watch this show, that they were taping the ones they were going to miss. She went on and on and on!! I mean really, enough already. A few months after they left, I decided to watch one. OH MY GOD!!! We now own all the seasons possible. What i find invaluable is listening to my husband laugh so so much, out loud!! Work is so stressful for him and Big Bang has givien me something I will charish for a lifetime. We love each and every one of them.......even Walowitz. :) So very worth owning, to watch again and again. I give them a zillion gold stars and my eternal thanks.
B00BBQXUYK|3.0|Cute movie with lots of action. Good humor and NOT packed with adult humor. This movie is really made for kids
B002BI6SMI|5.0|It's Liam Neeson acting all badass.  What more can be said!?  We need more like him and Batman in the world!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What makes Wool stand out in my opinion is it's topical relevance. In a world not unlike our own, the characters wrestle with power, greed, and the need to maintain control of an underground, experimental society known as a 'silo.' Layers within society exist, and only so many individuals can be appraised of the truth behind their history before tempting fate and inciting revolution. Censorship regarding the outside world is the status quo, and justice is meted out in sacrificial banishments to that dangerous unknown. The book examines the efforts of those maintaining the status quo, as well as the challenges faced by those who feel deceived and wish to rise against it. The world both unfolds and convulutes as the silo's inhabitants realize that leveling with the truth will require a collective effort, and that truth will not spread without a cost.

I really would like to get the game because I love all the angry birds games but I am affraid it won't work on my kindle fire!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|the best thing about this app is the way it adds the battery percentage to the notifications bar,  that's what I don't like about the little Icon thing it's hard to tell how much battery life you have
0670026603|4.0|This story was very moving. I became emotional when Louisa made the list of all the things Will could no longer do. As someone with incurable heart/lung problems (save double lung & heart transplant) I could understand the frustration of being limited in life although Will is much more so than I. Because of oxygen needs I can never go on a spontaneous trip. Even daily outgoings have tho be timed so I don't run out, but I usually get tired long before the oxygen runs out anyway.  All that being said I did not agree with Will's desire to die. He seemed to not have realized that even in his state he was able to touch people & change their lives. I believe our lives are gifts from God & we should pray to be useful & have a purpose until God calls us home.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I love Fringe, it is so original.  There is nothing like it on TV.<br />With a mix of totally creepy cases and a family unit that I have never seen on TV,<br />it blows me away every week.
B000TEMS3O|5.0|If u like 30 Seconds to Mars, you'll enjoy this album. If u never heard of 30 Seconds, you'll enjoy this album.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Fringe started with a bang, and after 5 seasons has not let up for a second!<br />Glad that they stuck to what they wanted to do, in the end, it was a show about FAMILY!!
B0098QBEXO|4.0|Surprise ending.  Couldn't see these guys as life-long friends.  Cumberbatch stuck out like a sore thumb amongst them.  Only one friend made sense to me.
B009GEDP26|5.0|Castle is the most fun you can have on a Monday.<br />The best banter on TV for sure.<br />Nathan and Stana are amazing together!!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The sound and the color are better than the dvd's of Star wars I had before.<br /><br />Lots & lots of stuff to look at on the extra disks<br /><br />If you love Star Wars you must have this set!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|It's rare that movies that are this genuinely captivating come out nowadays, but this one is definitely worth watching. I was only somewhat interested in seeing it initially, but after watching it, I'll probably end up purchasing it (something I rarely do with movies). It kept me on the edge of my seat (or, in the case of Amazon instant rentals, my couch at home), and made me feel like I was there in 1979 watching it all unfold. One of the best movies I've seen in years.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|Recommend this album to all Josh Groban fans.  I felt like it had a different sound than everything else I've heard, but it's still so JOSH, that there's no way to hate it!
1612185495|5.0|My grandson loved it! After Harry Potter, James Bond is his hero. Ian Fleming is a great writer of adventure and suspense.
0156012197|5.0|Excellent edition and translation.  This is a beautiful and deeply meaningful story, a treasure to gift to anyone who needs a reminder of how to love and what's really important in life.
B0094KT9Y0|5.0|This is a great movie. Perfect ending to the trilogy. Have to admit, the ending made me cry a little.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's stop cool. Can't ask for a better game. it's so addictive my mother can't get me off of it.
B00BHNR1KQ|5.0|I actually really enjoyed this movie!  It's not a blood and gore kind of movie, it has some spooky moments for sure!
0670026603|4.0|There has been a lot of hype surrounding this book and it was appearing everywhere one looked, so after enjoying her other novel, The Ship of Brides, I thought I would give this a read.<br /><br />I expected to be blown away by it because of the hype and I wasn't.  It was a well written novel and a good story concept, one that was quite topical and brave to tackle.<br /><br />It will certainly open the general discussion on Assisted Suicide and the rights and wrongs of it.  I just felt that the author did not do it quite enough justice.  She seemed to try and make the characters and stories throughout a bit too light and whimsical, perhaps to counteract the seriousness of the main issue but it just didn't seem right to me.  I would have preferred a darker tale throughout - I know what could be darker than being quadriplegic and discussing Assisted Suicide - but that is kind of my point.  I felt the author was trying to be too \\"chatty\\" with the characters .<br /><br />Don't get me wrong it was an enjoyable and interesting read but it just did not live up to the hype, in my opinion.  Still worth giving it a read as long as you go into it knowing that it will probably not blow your mind away.  I am struggling with my points as I am torn between a 3 or a 4 out of 5 for this for the above reasons.  I will go with a 4 as I don't want to put anyone off reading a good book, even if parts of it did not work well for me.
B008MJC6ZS|3.0|No surprises if you're looking for a new sound. But if you're just a solid Testament fan. You won't be let down
B00846F1YW|4.0|Good enough for hidden objects but frustrating as you need to enlarge the view then get penalised for over clicking when moving screen round to find objects! Lots of filling too with conversation s  between scenes. Still worth playing though.
B0039TAHMA|4.0|If you like the genre, you'll like these movies. I only gave it 4 not 5 stars for the stupid &#34;hollywood&#34; moments Peter Jackson inserted. Overall though, killer!
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|I have used Evernote on a Mac and a Windows PC, and even an iPod Touch, all with no problem. It doesn't appear to work on my Kindle Fire HD 8,9. I click on folders but the contents never appear. Either I'm doing something wrong, or it's the Kindle that is interfering with the app running properly.
0399246665|5.0|Great product and fast shipment! Bought this these books for my wife and she loved them. I would definitely buy this product again, you can't go wrong with Eric Carle.
B002OKO1GI|4.0|This is a funny light hearted movie that is appropriate for the entire family.<br />Charles Groden does not disappoint the audience
0374531943|5.0|Collins is witty, insightful, and all too modest in the best account of the early space program I have ever read.
0345803485|3.0|It wasn't what I thought it was. It just wasn't an adult read for me. Story line was good but too much of sex weirdness and fantasy situations on woman's part.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|It was a decent read; he's no Shakespeare, but if you're a milnut, you'll enjoy it. If you aren't into technical details, you probably won't.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I wanted a spare cable for when I travel and it arrived quickly, was reasonable and a good quality product.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Abraham Lincoln (as happens to most young folk of my generation) exited my mind shortly after I graduated high school. He was a good man, a good leader and he did good things for this country, that's what I knew. I knew of course a little about his family, knew much about the Civil War, but had no real interest beyond that.<br />Being active in theatre in my small town of Charlottesville, Va., I was excited to hear that 'Lincoln' would be filmed only two to three hours away from where I lived. Local people in the area were in the film and they all agreed: it was a spiritual experience. It was something that they would never forget, not only the experience but the kindness of everyone involved.<br />I saw 'Lincoln' with a biased mind towards a film capable of greatness yes; but it did renew my fervor for understanding a man who exuded simplistic humanity, struggled with his own demons and did the best he could, faced with such 'loud' odds against what he believed to be right.<br />It was a beautiful show of dignity for these times we live in.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I'm enjoying this puzzle game very much. It's a nice way for me to relax and to work out the puzzles without a lot of effort.
0385737955|3.0|The Good: This is a massively impressive world Dashner has created. I was constantly questioning what was going on, why it was happening and what it could all mean. There was a real fear response on my part to the situation Thomas and the others were living in. Had books like this been around when I was a kid, I would have had nightmares.<br /><br />The Bad: The Maze Runner was just so hard for me to get into. While the story made me fear for the characters in a general sense, I had trouble connecting with any of them. Without that emotional connection, I could have put the book down at any time with only a slight curiosity as to what comes next.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Magic Jigsaw has fixed many of the irritations on my Kindle Fire HD. This is by far the best puzzle app out there.
B002NXOQF2|4.0|It was a good descriptive story, maybe a little too descriptive, but it had a creative storyline and I was quite impressed.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The plot layout is unique and while you think you may know the answer to they mystery, it changes constantly.  Very well done.

B007GE2H3G|3.0|I was never a Tintin fan, never read the comics or books, so didn't know what to expect from the movie it wasn't bad,although I was always under the impression Tintin was a kid, the movie made it seem like he was an adult, in any event I gave this three stars not for the story, didn't care for it, the humor fell flat, but I did like was the colors the scenery, the crispness of the colors, the animation was great.<br /><br />All in all those who love Tintin will love this move, for me I didn't become one after watching.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|Other than some occasional freeze-up on opening g this ap, it's pretty well designed. My Horse keeps your attention and is fun to play. There are enough goals to keep you playing. Definitely worth trying.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This is a very interesting read but a little unrealistic. For instance, how does a teenage boy have the funds to rent a motel for a somewhat  extended amount of time. There was no mention of his having a job.
B008Y73940|5.0|Great movie. good plot with a surprise along the way. I watched this on Amazon Prime via streaming  for free!
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Gripping in every way. Great acting, great story line; l watched season two on Showtime and can't wait for season 3.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Good app you can acess facebook real easy and lots of other stuff you can look up, would recommend. Good.
0307744434|2.0|I considered giving this book a one star review, but I've read books that I've despised more than this one, so if the book has any redeeming quality and if any part of it keeps me entertained even in the slightest, I'll be generous and throw it an extra star.<br /><br />I really don't understand how this book was published, how it received critical acclaim, or how it became a best-seller.  It violates the oft-repeated admonition to writers of \\"show don't tell.\\"  This book \\"tells\\" everything.  Also, the author uses the maximum possible number of words to convey a thought.  She is quite good at giving physical descriptions, but that's all this book is -- about 400 pages of physical descriptions of a black-and-white themed circus, of fabrics, of color-changing gowns, and of dinner parties.  Interspersed with these 400 pages are about 100 pages of a vague \\"plot\\" and some brief character sketches, none of which are fully realized.  I am, frankly, amazed that this author, who possesses an MFA, and can write some nice sentences, was able to write a book with no plot AND no character development -- usually you have to have at least one to succeed, and many readers can forgive the relative lack of one if the other is strong.  Here, all we've got is a lot of repetitive and relatively useless physical description and scene-setting.<br /><br />I thought the last 100 pages were the best of the book, perhaps because I thought we were finally coming to some sort of resolution and everything would come together.  Although there was somewhat of a resolution, there were still a lot of questions, and the ending was still unsatisfying.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|A very good app. Love the weather channel. I can not get iwitness to work though. I sign in to iwitness and it is not able to load.

B000AM1TGC|5.0|Not only are the Genesis guys (including Hackett himself, obviously) frequently heard from, Hackett was still working very much in the Genesis style of this period, so the arty prog bits are balanced by strong melodies.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|While this movie is based on actual events; a little dramatic license was taken to make this an exciting film.  Ben Affleck’s character, (Tony Mendez) was a rising star in the C.I. A.  and has to find a plan to get six hostages out of Tehran.  While he’s changing TV channels, his character is talking to his son on the phone. He switches on the same channel his son is watching.  One of the last Planet of the Apes movies was on TV.  It shows Cornelius going to the Forbidden City to find the secret tapes that proved the existence of his parents.<br /><br />This gave him an outlandish idea.  To pose as  a movie producer of a science fiction epic.  The hostages would pretend to be part of the film crew.<br /><br />The movie is anchored by the fine performances of John Goodman, Allan Arkin and  Bryan Cranston.  If it wasn’t for these veteran actors, the film wouldn’t have been as good as it was.  The events were a fantastic plan that actually worked in real life. It took a very long time before this story was declassified by the government.  It’s  ironic, because President Carter was criticized and labeled as ineffective.  It was Carter that sanctioned this plan that saved the hostages.<br /><br />There’s a brief documentary at the end of this film that shows us how the plan was carried out.  There were fake publicity, press releases and art produced especially for this mission.
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|I've only used it in the house to see how well it lite up the area and I was impressed.
B008602KQI|4.0|I give the movie 4 stars for not explaining certain things well enough. I understand things need to be left out for length, but it helps if the movie points still make sense. Amazon wise. Great as always. Shipped quickly. Good price.

1616550414|4.0|This book is amazing, a Must Have for any The Legend of Zelda Fan, it really gets you inside on the games graphical design conception (mostly on Skyward Sword). Also the chronology section is beautiful, explaining everything and how it &#34;should&#34; connect with each game on the Timeline.<br /><br />The quality is superb, but it looks like it will wear a bit on time because mine got a very tiny piece of the hard cover off, only by opening it a couple of times.

B002ZG9968|1.0|I normally shy away from giving books, films, and other items on Amazon single-star reviews -- usually I can find at least one redeeming quality in a work, or find something inept/boring/unpleasant without absolutely hating it.  But every once in awhile I happen upon a work that is just so thoroughly unpleasant, so badly handled, and so dreadfully boring that I can't help but give it the lowest rating this website will allow.  These are works that are so bad they're not even good in a \\"so bad it's hilarious\\" way -- they're genuinely painful to sit through.<br /><br />\\"The Back-Up Plan\\" is one of those.<br /><br />Pet store owner Zoe, having given up on the search for Mr. Right, decides that she really wants a baby and gets herself artificially inseminated.  Predictably, shortly after the procedure \\"takes,\\" she runs into the perfect man -- Stan, a farmer's market merchant who makes and sells his own goat cheese.  The two fall in lust (they never have enough believable chemistry to make me believe they love each other), and only after they've slept together does Zoe reveal her pregnancy (with twins no less).  The rest of the film deals with the antics of a pregnant woman, an inept first-time dad dealing with an upcoming baby that's not even his, and several break-ups and make-ups before the inevitable happily-ever-after ending.<br /><br />There's so much wrong with this movie.  The script is totally inept, with no memorable lines and the sort of cliche, forced lines you'd expect from a mediocre sitcom.  There are no truly humorous scenes, only awkward or disgusting scenes that the movie desperately tries to force onto the audience as funny.  It's almost as if the film itself is going \\"Laugh at this, laugh dangit!\\"  But is there really humor to be had from Zoe's crippled dog eating her pregnancy test, her scarfing chili straight out of a pot with her hands, her water breaking at a wedding and causing everyone on the dance floor to slip and fall, or her single mom's support group (which is made up of some the most horrible caricatures of lesbians I've ever seen)?<br /><br />The most horrific example of an awful scene played for laughs -- one that's memorable in a truly bad way -- is when Zoe attends the home birth of a woman from the single mom's group.  I'm not going to lie, this is the scariest birth scene ever recorded to film outside of a science fiction or horror film.  I found myself cringing instead of laughing watching the laboring mother flop around in a kiddie pool of water, howling like a dying whale and screeching orders at everyone around her.  I really can't blame the main character for passing out in the middle of the event.  (Though for added \\"humor\\" the filmmakers have her faint face-first into the kiddie pool where the woman has just given birth.  Classy.)<br /><br />When it's not being awful with bad misfire attempts at humor, the film is just boring.  You can pretty much predict every plot point, from the multiple breakups between Zoe and Stan as she deals with her trust issues, to Stan's inevitable rush to the hospital to get there before the babies are born.  The characters are all stereotypes, the two leads are bland and lack chemistry, the dog and babies are little more than living props, and there is not a laugh or a tug at the heartstrings to be had from the whole sordid mess.<br /><br />If you want a sweet and original (if offbeat) romantic comedy, I recommend \\"The Wedding Singer\\" or \\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\\" over this.  If you want a comedy that revolves around a pregnancy, I recommend \\"Nine Months\\" instead.  If you absolutely must watch this film, I recommend having something better on hand to get the awful taste out of your mouth.  Even \\"The Room\\" is better than this -- it's at least so bad it's hilarious.port group (which is made up of some the most horrible caricatures of lesbians I've ever seen)?<br /><br />The most horrific example of an awful scene played for laughs -- one that's memorable in a truly bad way -- is when Zoe attends the home birth of a woman from the single mom's group.  I'm not going to lie, this is the scariest birth scene ever recorded to film outside of a science fiction or horror film.  I found myself cringing instead of laughing watching the laboring mother flop around in a kiddie pool of water, howling like a dying whale and screeching orders at everyone around her.  I really can't blame the main character for passing out in the middle of the event.  (Though for added \\"humor\\" the filmmakers have her faint face-first into the kiddie pool where the woman has just given birth.  Classy.)<br /><br />When it's not being awful with bad misfire attempts at humor, the film is just boring.  You can pretty much predict every plot point, from the multiple breakups between Zoe and Stan as she deals with her trust issues, to Stan's inevitable rush to the hospital to get there before the babies are born.  The characters are all stereotypes, the two leads are bland and lack chemistry, the dog and babies are little more than living props, and there is not a laugh or a tug at the heartstrings to be had from the whole sordid mess.<br /><br />If you want a sweet and original (if offbeat) romantic comedy, I recommend \\"The Wedding Singer\\" or \\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\\" over this.  If you want a comedy that revolves around a pregnancy, I recommend \\"Nine Months\\" instead.  If you absolutely must watch this film, I recommend having something better on hand to get the awful taste out of your mouth.  Even \\"The Room\\" is better than this -- it's at least so bad it's hilarious.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|I was surprised by how much i enjoyed this book. I liked the characters from the start. This is also one of the more well written books i have read of late. I usually like theilitary sci fi books but this one drew me in. Not to mention there was some substance to it. This book was not one of those quick read, turn and burn books. I highly recommend it.
B002V092M4|5.0|This was a re-read for me. I really enjoy the tight writing and great descriptions. This author really gets your imagination going. The suspense it wonderful and you are never sure until the very end.<br />I would suggest this author to any who enjoy suspense or like to study WWII.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Product is fine.  I need more background in French history to entirely understand the book. Victor Hugo was an impressive writer with a thorough command of vocabulary.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|My son suggested this to me. It reminded me of the Andromeda Strain. The writing technique was very different but very easy to read and very enjoyable. The author's description of how the government changed to fit the circumstances is very realistic but surprising, I don't think any government would be so sensible in real life.
B004EF8AJA|5.0|Wonderful story.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Loved this book. A real page turner.  Mr. Brown not only writes an amazing story but gives lots of facts and history in this novel as he does with all the others I've read of his.  Would recommend for sure.
B00846REIS|5.0|I love the characters in this book! It captivates the reader with hot, steamy sex but also offers other aspects of life that complicate everything!

B00881VLCE|2.0|I have used this app for a couple months &amp; loved it, but all of a sudden it stopped working. I have to constantly reinstall it if I want to play and re-download all the free puzzles I had because they are all deleted when I reinstall it. if they can fix this issue I'll give it 5 stars!!
1475143389|5.0|I don't buy a lot of \\"workout or build a body\\" books and think for the most part its alot of cheap mumbo jumbo... but for some reason when I saw this on Amazon , it struck me as something different. Good thing I stuck with my intuition because that's exactly what this book was, very informative and easy, simple to the point, for people wanting to bulk, cut , or even just maintain. Ansd for its price, can't complain either......... BUY THE BOOK!!! ' Nuff Said, its an awesome read, and loved every page
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I liked it. It was just a little far fetched  with it  being based  in 2011 and her not having a cell phone, email address, or automatic email sent to her phone. You can tell an older person wrote the book. Other than that it was  great.
B0053O89YM|5.0|Maintains a good story line, characters seem believable. Great clothes. What else can I say, I like it.  End of story.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Plants vs Zombies require skill and thought, deciding what plants to use and arranging them just right to keep the Zombies out. The difficulty goes up the further you get in the game, that keeps the game interesting and fun.
0446554995|4.0|Some long winded parts and some things just don’t make sense. But overall, I love the Pendergast books! they are an easy and fast read. My favorite is still the Cabinet of Curiosities.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|Literally! I love science fiction, and in my opinion, this one is two thumbs up. The first episode is a little hard to keep up with, but after that the story lines are great and keep you on the edge of your seat. Two thumbs up so far.
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|It was a good movie, kept you guessing. He loses his memory and has an outcome like the Bourne movies.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|This is pretty decent, overall-- fun, even.  It has a number of game modes, one of which is strongly reminiscent of the original Bejeweled, and two others that are fairly challenging take-offs.
0689835604|5.0|My 18 month old girl loves this book. She loves flipping up the pages to discover baby's belly button, hands, etc. It is one of her favorites.
1250007208|5.0|I was positive I was going to hate this book, But WOW, just WOW.....I loved the story, as much as it had a Cinderella feel to it the story was all its own. The characters were so well written. The Queen and the Stepmother I hated them!!!! Like I wanted to jump in the book and beat them kind of hate. Cinder, Iko, Kai were so likable and I loved them. I felt for Cinder the entire way through the book. I loved Kai and Cinder, the story gave just enough of their relationship without shoving it down your throat. If your going to have a Cyborg as your main character you're going to want her to be a strong independent character (not weepy and weak) and I just adored her.

B005COO1X6|4.0|I love Stephen King.  this book could have gone on for another 100 pages and you would have been happy
B000021Y77|5.0|Very fast shipping and great quality, this movie is also amazing. If you have not seen it, DO IT! I saw it a long time ago at an independent theater, glad to finally own it.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Good food for thought as we get further into the computer age, where we can make war at lomg distance.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Great Price on all you need.  This is the definitive Matrix collection.  Many Extras. Good packaging.  The only issues I have are: 1) I'm not a fan of double sided discs (even though they are the &#34;greener&#34; option).  2) The picture quality of the included DVDs is mediocre even on my up-scaling Oppo player. I was debating between giving this 4 or 5 stars and decided on 5 because of the sheer volume of 'stuff' included in this set.
B004BSFC46|4.0|I love them.  My granddaughter... not so much.  Maybe when she's a bit older...  She's only 3 months old now.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I first experienced this on HD-DVD.  I liked it then but now I believe it's even better.  I'm not sure if the blu-ray mastering was done any differently than that of HD-DVD, but I recall (whether real or imagined) that the overall 5.1 mix of the HD-DVD was a bit 'thin' and somewhat unbalanced.  The Blu-Ray release seems fuller in the bass and has a better overall musical balance.  I would have liked to have a bit more concert hall ambiance/audience feel in the mix, but it's a fine line between antiseptic (as on the &#34;America - Live in Chicago&#34; blu-ray which is crisp, but all the audio seems to be processed through the board with little ambient noise) and overblown (as on the Rush Blu-Ray &#34;Snakes and Arrows&#34; where the crowd is sometimes too much in the mix.) One of the best (unfortunately non-bly-ray) concert mixes to my ears is that on the Eric Clapton DVD &#34;One More Car One More Rider&#34;  I realize audio is extremely subjective however.  All this is actually nitpicking what is overall a very good blu-ray concert experience. You won't be disappointed if you pick this one up.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|If you're squeamish about nudity and sexual situations in film, thus movie is NOT for you.  If you are not, then this is a very interesting movie based on a true story of a man who got polio and lived most of his life in an iron lung. He wants to experience sex before he dies and hires a sex therapist to help him achieve this goal.  I felt almost voyeuristic while watching, but it was really well done and pretty entertaining, despite the intensity of its subject matter.  Well worth the effort, I'd say!
B00AMBH70S|3.0|I really liked the Bourne Series, even the newer ones by Van Lustbader, but I think the lead they chose to play Jason in this particular movie was a poor choice.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|Everyone in my family loves this movie. We watch it every Christmas and sometimes inbetween. Fun for adult familes. Not a children's  movie. Nice to have one for &#34;grown ups&#34;.
1594489505|5.0|This book offers a very different point of view--that of a boy remembering his growing up in a very foreign (MidEast) country--interesting & enjoyable.
B000YHG72E|4.0|Brought it at the request of a family member to watch over Christmas. All had seen if before, but truly enjoyed it again. Will probably watch for many Christmases more.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|A good book, great for a quick read, light.  A good romance with just enough intrigue.  An easy fiction when you do not need to concentrate.
B000HKW7E0|3.0|This is a movie that can be watched every year. Not the best of the series, but still worth watching.
B000HX6DCO|5.0|It is old school South Park and absolutely hysterical!  I could not stop laughing from start to finish. It is a reminder of how funny South Park used to be.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|excellent will watch again later when time permits in the future kinda busy right now but will keep this one on my list to watch again
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really really really really really fun my son absoulutly loves it really good game lol worth download
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Great video quality. The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is because it took a long time to download the movie for offline availability. My internet connection was fast so I'm not sure why it took so long to download.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was a good sequel.  I want more!  it is less like 50 than the forst book, which adds to the suspense for me.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I never believed that a book could change a life, but this book sure changed mine. By telling his story about being held in a Nazi concentration camp, he illustrates how suffering can be endured by working out a reason for suffering. His reason was to survive so that he could write this book on the psychology of concentration camp prisoner, but more than that, I was touched that he focused on his love for his wife.<br /><br />The first part of the book is about his experiences in several concentration camps and the rest of the book explains how what he learned can be applied to one's life. I learned that everyone suffers differently and what seems easily endured by me, for others seem insurmountable and visa versa. It helped me to show more compassion for others in their suffering even though it seemed they were making too much out of it.
B0091W5UWG|4.0|I liked that it had suspense, drama, and romance. Whitney Houston's voice is always so wonderful to listen to. I have seen it twice!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|It draws you in and won't let go. I can't wait to get back to it when I have to do other things.<br />Looking forward to season three of the TV show.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|No other show on television has the quality of actors, story-line and sets/locations.  This show should take home multiple awards.
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|The Master is a frustrating film b/c the quality of the acting and the compelling premise lead you to believe that the full story simply MUST be gripping.  It's not.<br /><br />The first half of the movie introduces you to some fascinating characters, and you're never quite sure what to make of them, what you are seeing, how much of it is real, how much of it is in someone's mind.  You can't help but want to learn more, to unravel the mystery.<br /><br />But sadly, as the movie aimlessly drifts into its second half, you're left feeling emptier and emptier, with fewer answers and less interest in the characters and the story.  Like The Master himself, you can only conclude that it was a bunch of BS being made up as the story went along.<br /><br />That description might create enough intrigue for you to watch this movie anyway, but if you're like me, you'll wish you had listened to the many disappointed viewers, and move on.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Favorite show!  Kevin Bacon and James Purefoy give amazing performances.  It's a nail-biter every show.  The suspence is killing me- can't wait to watch the next episode.
B009LDXQGC|5.0|Just great to listen to in a nice quiet place or with someone.  A piece of music to just have fun with or a person you love.  Enjoy.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I can now use my Kindle to get and read my e-mail. So helpful. Why didn't you do this a long time ago?
B00199B2Z8|2.0|I thought this book was going to be some short stories about different weddings, instead, it was one long, drawn out, unbelieveable story.  I did not like it and wouldn't reccomend it to anyone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game, its so much fun... its addicting and I play it every single day!!! I will continue to play this game everyday because ts amazing
B0000029PC|5.0|I lived in Cleveland at the end of Szell's career.  This brings back memories of how great the Cleveland Orchestra was then.
B004L0NGEC|4.0|I do wish I could figure out how to move albums around.  We are putting our slides on the computer.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was an overall good book always kept me wanting more. I wished there would have been more books to continue
B0050CQY1W|4.0|I ordered this CD and it was not a good quality CD.  Certain songs would skip as I was playing it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a very fun game but its basically like temple run. Also it freezes up ALOT. Overall tho its a pretty fun game to play.:):):):))
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|It seemed like the main character Ethan Hawke never turned the lights on, and this movie just did not make a whole lot of since.  The ending was horrible and left you hanging and in my opinion they do not need to have a second one....
111846446X|5.0|So I read this book expecting to find out all about python GPIO control on the raspberry Pi, but this book is clearly for beginners/amateur programmers. Still a good read, especially the bits about the Raspberry Pi foundation, but you maybe want to buy a more advanced book if you're an experienced hobbyist.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|I rented this for my kids thinking ok another boring cartoon but i really enjoyed it. It was a really cute movie and good story plot.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Ms. Goodwin is a world class historian. Her research is impeccable, her narrative creates a visceral connection to her descriptions, and she encourages a deeper study of her chosen subject.  Thank you, Ms. Goodwin, for once again stretching my educational boundaries.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is a very, very useful application! It wakes me up 1 hour before school so I can watch Downton Abbey! (Best show ever!)
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I wanted a case that had a flip stand so I settled on this one.  It was a bit pricey when I first got it at 20 bucks but it has held up well.  The case covers the Kindle very well and the flap is very sturdy.  It has held up through a ton of travel abuse and it still looks pretty new.  I often get compliments at how sleek it looks from friends and family when I visit.  The one thing I ended up loving was the strap that you can use to secure the unit shut.  Without that strap I would feel hesitant to throw the Kindle in with my other stuff in my pack but since it is there I have no qualms about it.  The screen stays protected the whole time.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I finally broke down to see what the hype was all about.  I don't get it.  The writing is horrible, the characters are overdramatic.  It was just bad in every way.  Did I mention the writing?  How did these books become best selllers?  Even if somehow there is a great story in there, the amateur writing style surely would have put some people off.  Again, I don't get it.
B0053B347M|3.0|Lights are too weak and the strip isn't very strong.  Combined with the price, this isn't that good of a deal unless you had a very specific use for this item.  I bought it just to see how it would look behind a few monitors but it was all bad.  I ended up using the strip to light up part of my bookcase.  At least the switch on the usb cord is handy (it is closer to the lights than the usb plug).
B009XY97VC|5.0|I don't know where it came from, or where it will end. However this music is intensely EPIC. No matter what you are doing, this music will make it better! It takes you on a surreal adventure you want to join. Incredible emotion infused into each track.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|This book had a great base but wasn't on my list o top ten. It is a very touching story overall
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|I've wanted to see this movie ever since I saw the trailer and heard that Anthony Hopkins was the actor behind the incredibly believable Hitchcock. I finally watched it a few days ago, and it's lovely. Great one-liners, a little droll, and the acting is superb. I was a little nervous that it was called a &#34;love story&#34; when Hitch (&#34;hold the 'cock'&#34;) was already married, but it's a really great story. I've never seen Psycho, but I would recommend at least reading the IMDB synopsis before watching. I think that there were quite a few scenes that I would have enjoyed much more had i known more about Psycho. I'm actually thinking about getting the DVD in the hopes that there's a &#34;Making the Movie&#34; segment that talks more about the references to Psycho. A genuinely enjoyable, well-made film.
B008BM9L72|5.0|loved all of it, one of the best novel I have ever read .<br />i recommend it to anyone .

3836504715|5.0|This is a beautiful book.  Eugene Atget was a wonderful art photographer who covered Paris on foot photographing everything he saw that he thought was important to the history of Paris in the late 19th and very early 20th centuries before much of the demolition/changes took place.  His photography has kept an historical record of the city the way it used to be.  I found the book very interesting and needless to say the photography is superb.  I recommend this book.

B00003CXXP|5.0|This is a great science fiction movie, I enjoyed the storyline....A movie of the future, I thought it was definately worth watching.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|I did not like this app at all it was fun but it practically sucked the life out of my kindle fire and I was so mad and finally deleted it. I highly recommend (if you have children)  to not let your children anywhere near this app.

1932100385|5.0|Excellent work. And it works! May the truth be known in America. Sadly the medical industry will not recognize it because it doesn't pad their pockets, even though it helps the patient.
052118939X|5.0|This is the best book for people who want to learn English as second language. For those ones who like study grammar this book is also the best one.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This book just continues on from the 1st one. It is almost impossible to set down. I can't wait to read the next one.
B007MJT1K2|4.0|This is a good movie for the family to watch. Reminded us of Indiana Jones type movies, but then it is the same director and music composer.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Just couldn't set it down. It is sort of hard to follow just because of all the swedish names but it doesn't stop you from getting completely engrossed. So glad i read it before seeing the movie, although the movie was awsome as well!!!
B0067TGSOK|4.0|How much money do you need to start a business?<br /><br />Chris Guillebeau believes that borrowing money to start a business is now completely optional. The quest for personal freedom lies in the pursuit of value for others. The author advises entrepreneurs \\"to focus on the point of convergence between what you love to do and what other people are willing to pay for\\".<br /><br />This book is about people who start their own microbusinesses without investment, without employees, and often without much of an idea of what they're doing. They almost never have a formal business plan and they often don't have a plan at all except to \\"try this out and see what happens.\\" The new entrepreneurs think carefully about all the skills they have that could be helpful to others and then take action.<br /><br />Many of the \\"unexpected entrepreneurs\\" in this book lost a job or left a job and were forced to start a small business from scratch to pay their bills. They say \\"necessity is the mother of invention\\" and that was definitely the case in many of the stories in this book. These people have turned their passion into profit while creating a more meaningful life for themselves.<br /><br />The primary lesson that I learned from this book is the importance of mindset. You really have to be determined, persistent and dedicated to making your business work. That means your entire life must revolve around this business 24/7. The case studies in this book are NOT get-rich-quick schemes. The owners of these small businesses had to work very hard to achieve success. The startup cost might be $100 but the amount of work, sacrifice and perseverance that is required is tremendous. I am afraid the author makes it look a bit too easy.<br /><br />This book offers inspiration for readers who have lots of passion but little money to invest in a startup.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Once again you just can't set it down. I have engoyed the trilogy and am sorry there aren't any more to read.

The DVD mentions a diet plan as well, but I guess you have to go to Jillian's website, where it wants you to sign up for a membership.

0385344228|3.0|IMO - It was a slow build, the narrator was unbelievable, and the \\"twist\\" wasn't a HUGE surprise. I pushed myself to read the entire book simply because I thought there would be some jaw-dropping twist, and I feel like the book just \\"hit a brick wall\\" and ended without any real closure. I was really looking forward to reading this book - I had it on my wish list for a while - but I have to admit. ..I'm a little disappointed.

1455508977|2.0|One of my co-workers gave me this book to read as we all read a lot of the same books here. I have never read any of Sparks books before. I felt the beginning was long and drawn out and not being involved in the military, I really didn't understand a lot of it. I almost gave up on it, but I have never put down a book without giving it a chance. It started to pick up and got very suspenseful which I really go excited about. I especially adored Ben and could feel what it was like for him going between parents and dealing with peer pressure. What a sweet kid. Unfortunately, at the Epilogue I felt like I was robbed of a very emotional and exciting ending. It was so powerful leading up to it, it just went flat for me. I loved the cover though.

B00AA0TZTW|2.0|People, Hell and Angels is for Jimi Hendrix completists only.<br /><br />This is a very disappointing release that is FAR from “12 new studio recordings” as being advertised by Experience Hendrix.  Almost all of these songs have been released in far superior versions on readily available retail releases.  They have duplicated multiple songs from the Valleys Of Neptune album they put out just a couple of years ago also, including the second single from that album!<br /><br />I’ll break down the technical details of each song so you can see what you’re truly getting here.<br /><br />1.  Earth Blues - Several years ago, John McDermott, one of the producers of this album and Hendrix catalog manager said in his book Ultimate Hendrix that this song was “loose” and non-cohesive with it being ultimately abandoned due to tuning and tempo issues.  Now he’s changed his opinion to calling it “stripped-down funk.”  Interesting change of heart when it comes time to put together a “new Hendrix album.”  Additionally, the final studio version mixed by Jimi was released on First Rays Of The New Rising Sun, and then re-released in a deluxe version just a few of years ago.  This version on People, Hell and Angels is far inferior and simply a demo that lacks many of the overdubs and embellishments that Jimi himself later added to the version released on First Rays of the New Rising Sun.  Confusing as to why they would include this inferior track and call it a “new studio recording.”<br /><br />2.  Somewhere - Firstly, Jimi’s guitar work shreds on this song.  However, this song has a lot of technical issues.  Listening to the song carefully, especially the last half, it’s easy to notice the amateurish “cut and paste” job Eddie Kramer did on this track, and it’s disconcerting to say the least.  This song was made up of several takes, and put together in shoddy fashion.  During the breaks after Jimi’s verses, you can hear how his vocals were inaccurately pasted into this song.  This is most noticeable at the break around 3:00, his vocals don’t match up and aren’t in time.  The timing when the instrumentation comes back in after Jimi’s ending vocals is so off, it makes one wonder if Mr. Kramer has any sense of timing at all.  The vocals are from an entirely different take of the song than the instrumentation, which isn’t a problem in and of itself, but Kramer’s mixing of the song is horrible.  Also, you can hear how Jimi’s guitar breaks out of the field of sound field a bit in places because it was part of a studio rehearsal, not a “new studio recording,” as advertised.  Not something that sounds good played loudly like most Hendrix fans enjoy.  And all these issues on the lead single off the album?  A version that is actually “in time” was released on the Jimi Hendrix Experience Boxed Set in 2000 in better quality, and the vocals are in time.  Can’t believe the shoddy cut and paste jobs they are doing to Jimi’s work, very sad Eddie Kramer<br /><br />3.  Hear My Train A Comin’ - How many times do we need to see this song released?  Studio versions of this song have been released at nearly a half-dozen times on official releases by the Hendrix estate over the years, including being released on their last “new Hendrix studio album,” Valleys of Neptune, just a couple of years ago!  The song was released twice on the single disc Blues release, again on the Martin Scorsese Presents the Blues album, on The Jimi Hendrix Experience Box-set, etc.  Not to mention the numerous live versions that have been released all over the place.  This version on People, Hell and Angels is inferior to all of them and is NOT a studio version, this is from a practice run-through session of the band and they are mis-labeling it as a studio version, which is easily observable when listened to.  It sounds like it was recorded in a garage and is the first time Jimi got together with Buddy Miles and Billy Cox to practice songs.  Keyword being “first time” and “practice.”  Sound quality speaks volumes on this one as you hear Jimi’s vocals distort in places.<br /><br />4.  Bleeding Heart - This song was released as a SINGLE off of the Valleys Of Neptune album they released just a couple of years ago and they release it again already?  Two times in a row?  Yet another studio version was released on South Saturn Delta.  Here on People, Hell and Angels we get a far inferior version that is nothing more than a studio rehearsal, not a completed studio recording.  The sound quality almost sounds like it was recorded in a bar and there is nothing fantastic about this take.<br /><br />5.  Let Me Love You - One of the truly “new” songs on the album and Jimi doesn't sing a single word in the song.  This is actually a Lonnie Youngblood song that Jim just plays guitar on.  A good song though.<br /><br />6.  Izabella - This song has been released multiple times.  The definitive studio version has already been released on First Rays of The New Rising Sun.  An alternate studio version from this same recording session was released on The Experience Hendrix box-set in 2000.  They released yet another version on the Burning Desire album.  The version we have here on People, Hell and Angels is far inferior to the already released versions.<br /><br />7.  Easy Blues - This is a purely instrumental song released on the Nine To The Universe album.  Experience Hendrix claims that this “new extract” is nearly twice as long as the Nine To The Universe release, which is untrue.  The Nine To The Universe release was 4:30 and this version is 5:57, a mere 1 minute and 27 seconds longer.  It’s the same version, with another minute and a half of instrumental.  Not sure if someone forgot how to do arithmetic or what.<br /><br />8.  Crash Landing - This song was released on the album Crash Landing, with the original instrumentation replaced by Alan Douglas, which a lot of people thought wasinsane to do.  Here we get the original version, although Jimi’s vocals have been pasted from another take, and one beat behind, not in time!  Eddie Kramer, how are you doing this to multiple songs on the same album? Better yet, how did this pass quality control after that glaring mistake? A shameful hack-job.  Additionally, Eddie Kramer (producer) and John McDermott (catalog manager) both stated how horrible this recording was in the book they released, Ultimate Hendrix, stating that this song was “uninspired.”  Now that they want to release it as some “newly found gem,” McDermott has changed his position from calling it “uninspired” to saying “it’s really good.”  Interesting.<br /><br />9.  Inside Out - Yet another early instrumental version of Ezy Ryder, no vocals at all.  They released two more early Ezy Rider jams on the “new studio album,” Valleys Of Neptune, and the Fire CD single from that same album just a couple of years ago!  Add in even more Ezy Rider jams released on the Hear My Music and Burning Desire albums, and we’re just about at a half-dozen releases now.  So now we’re getting alternate versions of recently released early versions of songs?<br /><br />10. Hey Gypsy Boy - Released on the Midnight Lightning album with Alan Douglas overdubs, here we have the original version as Jimi intended it, which is nice to hear.<br /><br />11. Mojo Man - Yet another song that Jimi has no vocals on.  This isn’t a Jimi Hendrix song, it’s a Ghetto Fighters song with Jimi guest appearing on rhythm guitar.  And when I say “rhythm guitar,” I means exactly that because there are not even any guitar solos by Jimi on this song.  Additionally, it’s obvious a lot of tinkering was done to the song long after Jimi’s passing, none of which is very flattering.  This song was also already released as a single by the Ghetto Fighters just a mere year ago – Not unreleased by any means.<br /><br />12. Villanova Junction -  John McDermott,one of the producers of this album and Hendrix catalog manager said in his book Ultimate Hendrix that this song was “disjointed,” but in a recent interview flip-flopped and said that it was “a sweet way to bring the record to a close.”  This was what I expected to be one of the shining points of the album, but  this is merely a 1 minute and 45 second excerpt of this instrumental that fades out in the middle of the jam, unbelievable.  For an album that barely clocks in at 50 minutes long, it’s pretty obvious they could have, and should have, included the full Villanova Junction jam.  Additionally, there was a 5 minute version of this song released on the Burning Desire album.<br /><br />To Casual Fans – Avoid this release completely.  If you are a casual fan of Jimi Hendrix, this release is going to be sorely disappointing to you as almost all of theses songs have been released in superior versions on other retail releases.  Additionally, this collection is not a fair representation as to the quality of Jimi’s studio material.  Go with Are You Experienced, Axis: Bold As Love, Electric Ladyland, or First Rays Of The New Rising Sun.<br /><br />To Completists – Obviously a must-have, but be prepared to be disappointed in order to add this “new studio album,” to your collections when hearing some of the amateur cut and paste jobs on Jimi’s vocals, leaving them off beat in some songs (Somewhere, Crash Landing, etc.).  Experience Hendrix created a sub-label called Dagger Records many years ago, which they use to release albums of alternate versions of songs, demos, and songs that didn’t have a place on mainstream studio albums.  People, Hell and Angels belongs on that label as a release for Jimi Hendrix completists only.<br /><br />This is a pretty low cash-grab on the part of Experience Hendrix.  In fact, Eddie Kramer, head producer on the project was interviewed on video by Harmony Central after mixing this album down and said “this is the, HOPEFULLY [emphasis added by Kramer], the last of all the studio albums,” which seems to imply he is being coerced in some capacity by Janie Hendrix to arrange inferior albums like this in order to fulfill contractual obligations to Sony.  Pretty clear he didn’t want to publicize a collection like this as a studio album, because it’s not.  They are duplicating songs that were on the “new studio” album they released just a couple of years ago (Valleys of Neptune), including that album's second single (Bleeding Heart)!  And inferior versions of these songs at that.<br /><br />I was critical of their last release Valleys of Neptune, but still have it 3 stars out of 5 because it did contain some new music.  However, this release is just shameful.  This is a collection of nearly all alternate (and inferior) versions of songs that have already been released.  There is so much duplication against their recent releases and songs that pale in contrast to their already released versions, that it’s clear what’s going on here:  Experience Hendrix (Janie Hendrix) is doing everything they can to fulfill the 10 album deal they inked with Sony a few years back and it appears they are trying to slip by far inferior quality material and advertise it as “new studio recordings” to do so.  That’s right; they are now contractually obligated to release 10 albums of “new material.”  They have released Valleys of Neptune, Live In Cologne, the West Coast Seattle Boy box-set, the Winterland box-set, and now this release.  That means they’re only half way to fulfilling this 10 album deal, so this is probably only the beginning of a string of horrid releases like this.<br /><br />Additionally, it’s important to note that there is still some good music contained on this album, but it’s not a studio album as advertised, not even close.  This is a disjointed collection of demos, alternate takes, jam sessions & rehearsals, already released songs, instrumentals, and tracksthat weren’t even Hendrix songs, but rather tracks he guest appeared on only playing guitar – All inferior to their already released counterparts.  If released as an “alternate versions” collection or as a disc in a rarities box set, this would be a real gem and Hendrix completists like me would be happy to purchase an accurately billed release, aside from the few tracks that have horrible timing issues due to amateurish “cut & paste” jobs on Jimi’s vocals.  However, the advertising of this being a “new studio album,” is going to do nothing but alienate many would be Jimi fans when they hear the inferior quality of these recordings and think that’s how Jimi’s “studio” material sounds.<br /><br />I’m being very generous in giving this album two stars despite of the inferior versions of already released songs included on People, Hell and Angels, and the amateurish (and off beat) pasting of Jimi’s vocals into many of the songs.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Good Game, a lot of fun. Much better than the original.  I dont know what else to say but apparently we have to write in order to review this...
0440539811|1.0|The book was poorly written and had filthy language and action depicted. The author simply used a name to garner attention and sales
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is also very fun , having a good time playing this love seeing what I can get it to do.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game. The graphics are great. Keep up the good work. The majority of things to buy require gems and they are hard to earn.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Well same as the other two , love it  so fun dragons galore , its a little confusing though  as to how we keep them feed and growing.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is a tremendous book, written by a true American. It will make you laugh, cry and feel some of the emotion and heart that Chris Kyle and his fellow warriors felt while fighting for our country.  Chris was taken from us too early and before he accomplished all that he set out to do. This is a worthy read that is very well written.  God bless the Kyle family and God bless the United States of America!
B001BKG9SK|5.0|Great!!! done very well! It took me back to a place long ago when I was a lot younger good times!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I played this game with my aunt and it was fun great for 3 year olds. I really like this game.
B003LXXEFG|5.0|What an album!  A true piece of work from the great Robert Smith. this one hits hard in the face of reality and what happens when things go bad. The arrangement of this album stands out almost as much as the lyrics that bring it together.  When Mr.  Smith exclaims in disintegration \\" that all he was left with is pictures of trickery\\"  due to the ultimate betrayal of someone who was trusted sends chills down the spine of anyone and many who can remember being in a similar situation.  This album will take you on a real head ride just make sure your prepared before you take the journey..
B006LSZECO|2.0|It started out okay as a New York romance between two different people who fall in love and dissolves into two sick people who almost deserve each other.  I found almost nothing redeeming in the telling of the tale.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This is exactly as I expected it to be. It is great quality and the picture is so clear that it is almost surreal.

B009NPKTN6|5.0|I love this movie so much.  It is good fun and lots of great music.  My husband and I just love this movie and watch it over and over.  Who know Tom Cruise could sing like that?
B001P1MZNI|4.0|1966. Sinatra maybe at his best and the Count Basie Orchestra is tighter than a drum head. Couldn't pass it up for $1.99. Great deal for some classic Sinatra.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What an amazing story!! It was full of so many emotions and drama and suspense... I loved it!! I'll definitely recommend it to others!!
0099579936|3.0|i wanted the sexy parts not the flowers and hearts romance crap and had to speed read thru tons of it to get the juicy parts. the second and third books are far better
B007PT1PEY|5.0|Very nicely laid out. Great storytelling of course! Probably the best purchase I have made for the Kindle so far.

B002VWNIEA|5.0|Great Movie, great condition of box and dvd also. The packaging was excellent. great buy and recommend it to anyone who loves Denzel movies.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|For me to read a book, it has to capture my attention on the first few pages.  This book had me hooked on the first page.  I read it in one day.  I should have been prepared for the end of the book. I was hoping for a different outcome.  The book was still very enjoyable to read.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|movie came on time and was in great condition. 5 stars. its a great christmas movie and train movie if your kids are into trains.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Clancy once again.  His attention to detail gives the reader the impression that<br />Tom Clancy was actually there in a real situation and is on the nightly news letting<br />us in on what went on.<br />Go Tom !!
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Good movie I enjoyed it and it is even better the second time around if you rent it.  Some of the jokes aren't noticed as much during the first showing so a second watching as a rental is fun.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was recommended to me and I would do also for anyone who enjoys a good read!!<br /><br />Can't wait for Landay's next.
B000002UY5|2.0|The CD works with a couple of skips.  However, be careful who you buy it from, because I would have rated it \\"good\\" at best--hardly \\"like new.\\"
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|We really like this movie.  It is quirky, sweet, funny and all the actors (good actors too) fit right into the odd storyline and flow of the movie.  The two young people who play Suzy and Sam are fabulous, morose, goofy, and sweet.  And I love the turn around of the 'scouts' (bullies) to support the 'lovers' later.  And Bruce Willis as the 'sweet' town sheriff/cop was a nice role for him.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|It's a nice collection of Sinatra music and I'm enjoying listening to it. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the voice of Frank Sinatra.
B007VTVGAQ|1.0|I have a rule for listening to cds: twice before you pass judgement. Very few albums don't need that second listen, but this is one of them. I barely made it through this album.
0345803493|5.0|I read straight through from the first one to the second book.  The writing is not the best and the characters are over the top but I could not put it down.  There is something compelling about this series though I can't quite put my finger on it.  If you did not like the first book don't bother because the style and writing does not suddenly improve.
B0088W6LGY|5.0|I like all kinds of scifi, with Atlantis being right up there.  If you like Stargate SG1, then you'll probably like this
B007IXWL2C|5.0|If you've made it this far in the series then you owe it to yourself to finish it out.  The writing is still the same the character are still the same so if you are expecting either to suddenly get better that's a little silly.  However, if you were addicted to the first 2 this one wraps the series up nicely and brings closure all the way around.  I must admit I was a little sad to let Anna and Christian go at the end.
B003TTH4IU|5.0|I love the show!!! I wish I would have watched the it when the show first came out years ago!!
0345803485|5.0|I must admit I did not think I was going to make it after reading the first 10% of the book or so.  The writing is repetitive and the dialogue was rediculous at times but by the time I was a quarter of the way through I was definitely hooked.  I can't really explain why given the poor writing but I was reading at all hours to find out what happens next.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton is engaging, intelligent and enjoyable.  This incredible cast provides us with characters that we love and hate, and can't wait to see what happens to them. Just when you are about to label one an exaggerated &#34;caricature,&#34; he or she shows another side and you are drown like a moth to a flame.  Even when the drama is at times exaggerated, it is a provides a guilty pleasure for your emotions, well worth indulging.  It is a compelling, emotional ride through one of the most interesting  periods of modern time.
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|Classic Movie improved on Blu Ray. Blu - Ray gave this movie a closer more creepy feeling. One of Hitchcocks best finally seen in the best format - Blu -Ray!
B00A757EFW|1.0|i too found the controls hard to use. I would be in the action and I would get my vision blocked by my own hand.
B008RTE066|5.0|Finally Magical Mystery Tour comes out on Blu - Ray! The Bonus features are cool to see. Scenes deleted that were directed by John Lennon, Aunt Jessie playing Jazz drums during a break in filming, and much more. Great to finally have the original EP  on vinyl. Love this release!
B000FCKGPC|3.0|This is the book when everything starts to become messy and unresolved. maybe I´m giving it 3 stars because I´m rating it after I read the next one, so I´m dissapointed because things got worse afterwards. I still hoped when I finished this one.
B006CDCWDM|4.0|This was a gift for my wife. She said she liked it. I am writing these words because it said i need to write 9 more words in order to post this review.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved it, couldn´t put it down. Leaves a lesson about humanity´s nature. Sad, but a lesson nonetheless. I liked the way it ended.
B007PP2J9I|4.0|Nancy Stultz<br />It was a great book but would have been a whole lot better if there wasn't some much extraneous data the was entered along the way.  I skipped over a bunch of this but the book was very interesting and I have this sinking feeling that we are well on our way to experiencing these cyber attacks as I finish reading the book.  It was interesting.  Good reading after you got past the &#34;fill&#34;.
B009GX69RK|1.0|The characters and the plot points have no depth.  All of the &#34;comedy&#34; seems forced and so unrealistic and just corny. I think the 2nd season is even worse than the 1st.

B005HHSXP0|5.0|This is another excellent work by R. Riordan. His easy to read and captivating style of writing will make even the least bookish people enjoy this story and thirst for more.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Love the show, and it's dialogue.  Think they've got a true winner with this Sherlock.  Not too sure about this version's characterization of Dr. Watson, but still enjoy the new take on him, and the actor is superb.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Fascinating first hand account of the Seals and of the take down of Bin Laden. These guys embody the word courage.
B008Q08EG8|5.0|This show is a classic and should be required veiwing before adulthood. The underlying theme is necassary for a strong charactor
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|Great movie the wife and I loved it as kids and now our kids do too! Great buy for the money!
B0027MJU00|5.0|I can't wait for her next book. I've read all three and love her writing style. The characters are all flawed, very human. The stories twists are not easily figured out.
B005HSL626|4.0|Wow fast and lots of fun. Got it on my kindle fire and graphics are the bomb. A must for all ages
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Was a really funny movie. Loved every minute of it!! A must see, great movie to watch as a family.

0811879542|5.0|I am a school librarian and so far this week I have read \\"Press Here\\" to Kinders, first and second graders and you would have thought I was doing amazing magic tricks in the library! With each action and turn of the page I got surprised gasps from my astonished audiences! It held each of every one of their attentions (even the normally squirrelly ones), which isn't an easy feat!<br /><br />I should probably purchase more copies, as it is certain to be a favorite to check out. Thank goodness it does have a boardbook type cover on it! With all of the pressing and rubbing and shaking, hopefully it will hold up after lots of checkouts!!<br /><br />It is SO simple, but it is pure MAGIC!!

B004W2UBYW|5.0|The book Steve Jobs was one of Amazon's recommendations when I purchased [[ASIN:B007F99HC6 Techmares: The World's Dumbest Computer Users]] (funny book I highly recommend) and I'm glad I did. I'm a sucker for all things that deal with technology. This book gives tremendous insight into what I now believe to be one of the greatest technology moguls of our time. Now I want to know even more about the man.
B000NY12LO|5.0|Great book to understanding what children are thinking and living at various ages. I think all educators, parents and high school students should read. Would be great conversation tool for advocacy classes.
0425263908|3.0|If you've read Fifty Shades, you'll recognize the pattern - working girl literally bumps into billionaire sex god. From that moment on, the two are magnetized and repelled by each other. The pattern works. I enjoyed the back and forth between these two because Eva never takes herself too seriously. We never truly get into Gideon's head in this, the first of the series. But, into his pants is enough for now.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Lots of things to do, you will find that the different types of dragons each have their own unique qualities
0385335997|2.0|The good: Gabaldon has dispensed with the gay = evil motif of the first two books. In fact, one of the most sympathetic and well-developed characters is a gay man.<br /><br />Also good: the first third of this was quite fun, because our heroine is a very, very minor character in that third, and the characters who are featured are much more interesting.<br /><br />The bad: Gabaldon has replaced the homophobia with breathtaking racism. From the heroine's &#34;one of my best friends is black but my daughter had better never date one&#34; to the portrayal of the &#34;Chinaman&#34; that had me repeatedly turning to the copyright information all, &#34;I didn't misread that date; this was written in 1994, right? As in, the late twentieth century? WTF, Gabaldon?&#34;, there were large chunks of this I could barely read for cringing.<br /><br />Also bad: when the heroine does re-enter the story, she does so with a vengeance, beginning with her appraisal of her forty-nine-year-old body as perfectly slim and muscled, with no fat whatsover, &#34;no jiggle&#34; in the arms and a stomach the flatness of which &#34;borders on concavity&#34;. This woman is not written as the type of person who would ever, ever work out. But at forty-nine and after having a child she is still effortlessly hotter than you, reader, will ever be. Got that? And we go downhill from there, with men stopping in the street overcome with desire for her, and the hero ranting again about her amazingness and her &#34;core of strength&#34; under all the beautiful delicacy BLAH BLAH BLAH. We get it: she's the most beautiful wonderful perfect human being EVER.<br /><br />Except for the racism, of course. And the fact that her parting words to her daughter when leaving forever are, &#34;Try not to get fat.&#34; (The hero's response to this is to tell her she's the world's most perfect mother. What, you thought there was another possible response to that? Not in this book, there isn't!)

0307474275|1.0|No matter how bad you have heard this book is, it is worse. You cannot actually believe it until you read it. In the spirit of inquiry, I braced myself to do just that.<br /><br />My husband possibly enjoyed my reading of this book more than I did, because I was soon talking back to it, particularly when the Incredibly Indecipherable Riddles started showing up. &#34;Sofia! Alexander Pope! Apple!&#34; I shouted, and then in each case had to slog through forty pages before the Stunningly Brilliant hero and heroine figured it out (&#34;APPLE, morons!&#34;).<br /><br />This book was mind-bogglingly stupid. I had expected it to be silly and fluffy, but the scope of idiocy evident in both the writing and in the assumed audience was far more than I was ready for. Brown is blatantly, openly writing for people who don't know who Mitterrand is, or I.M. Pei, or Saint Paul, or what the Louvre pyramid looks like, or that Leonardo da Vinci wrote in mirror image -- in one scene, I kid you not, two da Vinci scholars faced with the mirror image writing can't figure out what it is. Perhaps the Harvard professor hero has been too busy cultivating the perfect &#34;stubble lining his strong jaw and dimpled chin&#34;, or practicing his &#34;chocolatey voice&#34;, to, y'know, actually learn anything about his chosen field.<br /><br />For purposes of exposition, people -- actually just the heroine -- often express ignorance about incredibly basic aspects of the Grail legend, or church history, or basically anything that anyone who's ever seen &#34;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&#34; would know. The heroine is nothing but an audience for the male characters' explanations, and she cries a lot. Also she is a young hot brilliant cryptographer. Who can't figure out these incredibly stupid riddles. Yeah. And the villains are crippled and albino, while the Good Guys are hunky.<br /><br />It is asinine. It is unintentionally hilarious on every page. I live for the day when it gets bumped off the top slot in my librarything. No, I can't get rid of my copy - have you tried to give a copy to a used bookstore lately? And besides, I keep having to lend it out to people who won't believe me when I say just how bad it is.he top slot in my librarything.

B00AFROVQC|4.0|It's worth a read no matter your particular tastes in literature. While not everyone will love it, it's not a badly written book.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|What a great way to watch the movie.  We had it 2 weeks before the release date.  We could watch it at home at school and on mobile.  The movie itself is fantastic, the download made it even better.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|If you enjoyed the movie, and who didn't, then you will love the book. It reads very quickly, more or less follows the book and really goes into details about the people. Don't miss it if you are a fan or if you live EAGLES!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Sometimes I'm not in the mood to read books that I know will be upsetting or depressing, but I'm usually glad when I force myself to read them anyway.  Same goes for books about parts of the world I know nothing about.  This book is a very sad (at times) book about a place I previously knew nothing about, and I can't recommend it enough.  It is epic, witty, romantic, shocking and so much more.  Imagine reading the book &#34;1984&#34; and then realizing that there was a real place on Planet Earth just like Eurasia.  That's what reading this book is like.  We should all be paying more attention to North Korea for many reasons, and &#34;The Orphan Master's Son&#34;  is a great start toward understanding it.

B0039HR5QS|5.0|a great story...notice the all star cast, and good acting (as always) by Robert Redford. worth the time, worth the $
B006WWUDGQ|3.0|Nice music, but a song at a time is better than a whole album. I'm a 60+ guy, and it was just a bit mushy after about 3 songs or so. I have to mix it up with something harder occasionally. Well, a little more than occasionally. She's definitely a talented artist. But playing through the entire album is tiring.

B009UX2YAC|3.0|I just got on this app one day to find out that all my coins, caracthers, all my upgrades, and multiplayer scores were gone.I was sad cause I come on this app a lot of times on my free time.
B003VANOFY|4.0|These are nice wireless headsets.  Its the first time I have had wireless headsets though so I do not know if this is standard or if this is just quirks with this model.  The first qurik is sometimes it has trouble pairing with its own software and you basically have to force close the software and pair them back up.  The other quirk is the mute button.  I will place it on mute and go to something real quick and I come back and its off mute as soon as I pick them up.  I do not know if its sensing they are active or what but I am not a fan of this part.  Outside of those two things they are great.  The mic picks me up and not much of the background which is great.  The 7.1 is really nice if you are listening to something that supports it.  You need to take the 7.1 off though if you are skyping etc or it will sound really horrible.  I would for sure recommend these to anyone looking for a solid wireless headset.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book kept me on my feet and guessing what is going to happen next. I can not wait for the next book.
B002H3T3TM|3.0|Would have liked to see more concert performances and less backstage interviews. It's good to watch when there is nothing else on.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I know very little about Sweden, but because of the way the story is presented I didn't have any problem understanding the customs, the political situation or the way the police acted.  The characters are extremely interesting.  I liked the strength of the various females, especially Salander.  I wanted her to find some peace from the horror of her childhood.  I like the way the story concluded, but at the same time did not want it to end.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|I was skeptical about this series because of my allegiance to Sherlock but I can happily say that I really enjoy the dynamic between the two leads and the cases are interesting. Its not Sherlock but it doesn't do any disservice to the legacy of Mr. Holmes.
B009CF7GRY|3.0|Great supporting cast.  Great casting but the protagonists were poorly written.  Was not happy with the new selection of music.  Would not watch again.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I still love this show. Even though its set in such a stoic and stuffy time period, emotions and humor still come through. Great season.

B005ZOBNOI|3.0|The Fault in Our Stars. I wanted to love this book considering all friends' reviews and given the fact that I just recently lost someone to cancer. Characters were likable enough but I couldn't buy into the way these two spoke. Just don't think teens, smart or genius, would speak to one another this way.
B004EBT5CU|3.0|I am using Set Fire to the rain in 2 dance classes. This artist is a slow burn with me; it's taking me some time to click. &#34;19&#34; had the same effect.  In contrast, Alicia Keys, Vivian Green, Dido, Corinne Bailey Rae, Marsha Ambrosius, Laura Igzibor got me humming fairly fast

B000FC1MCS|5.0|How often do you get to know how the world is seen by a shy but high functioning autistic child? This novel offers a fascinating view of how much so called normal people miss out on seeing or appreciating  that this autistic child fully comprehends.<br /><br />The novel is narrated from the child 's perspective, and is a brilliant achievement.
B003VANOFY|2.0|I bought two sets of these and we love them.  I can wear them for hours and they don't hurt my ears.  After a long time the battery runs down and you can just plug them in without even taking them off.    Initially I was worried about what happens when the batteries do finally wear out, but I saw that Logitech is selling replacement batteries for $5.00.    Edited after about 2 years.    Both of these are now dead.  One went dead after about 6 months.  The other just won't charge and dies if unplugged.  Both suffer from horrible disconnection issues where the headsets will randomly go dead for 20 seconds every 5 or 10 minutes.    Both were under warranty, but Logitech's customer service seems to be designed so that no one ever actually uses the warranty.  After chasing them for about a week I just gave up and dumped the headsets and bought other brands.
B009IJJB8G|4.0|Well plotted and good acting. While not up to the BBC modernization of the same series, this is very well done.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|The movie did justice to the situation as depicted by the media at the time. There were many things that were not known at the time that the movie enlightens us. It is commendable that the true and complete story is brought to light of day. Very entertaining.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this app.  It's easy to play and feels like I am playing the REAL coin dozer game you find at the fairs, and some businesses.  I play it every day.  So much fun!
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|A good movie that entertains and enlightens. Makes one wonder if any of our Airline pilots actually suffer from conditions and weaknesses that affect some people. Denzel is superb as usual.
B000W93CHC|4.0|This is a good, albeit, very long, book. The characters were vividly described and interesting. The plots were many and varied. I recommend it.
0061864153|5.0|I love this book. The pictures alone are worth it but a small glimpse inside thier private lives makes it even better
B007TK77QE|1.0|Very ordinary. Too many characters. Cashing in on Harry Potter. Not a good story line. Disappointing. Such a talented writer could definitely do better.
B004LWZW9C|3.0|This movie was pretty good. It was a bit of a fluff piece but nice for a brainless romantic movie. Jon Bon Jovi is the reason I got it. His acting is getting better with each movie.
0345803485|1.0|If I could, I wouldn't even give it a one star. It was badly written. It's also like the writer didn't do a piece of research on the life and relationship of BDSM. Both partners have to be into the life style. It's not just a one way thing.<br />Before this writer writes another book, they really need to be like a real writer and do the research and take the time and care into their writing. This book is crap.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am an Amazon Prime member so I was able to access the series right through my blue-ray player. I used to have to hook up my laptop to my TV. The show is of the highest quality. Great acting, great plot lines, superb costuming and sets. I watched it every night until it was done. Looking forward for the current season.
B005MW8CUG|5.0|My husband is the easiest person to buy for.  I just go to his wish list and he is always happy. Can't make a mistake!  This was another winner.  Thank you!
B009AZZEU2|4.0|I’ll admit to more than a little trepidation when Soundgarden announced that they would be hitting the 90s nostalgia circuit and eventually release a new album.  Despite the fact that a number of classic bands over the years have in the past decade started recording new material that has actually strengthened their legacy – from Mission of Burma to Dinosaur Jr. – I still didn’t have the same hopes that Soundgarden would follow in their footsteps.  There are two seemingly contradictory reasons for this. One, Soundgarden stands as one of the most commercially and creatively successful bands from the 90s, and they arguably never put out a bad album.  Even Chris Cornell said he worried about tarnishing their legacy, and I was inclined to agree with him.  Two, by the time he, now infamously, teamed up with Tambaland for his last solo album, Cornell, who had become the most visible face of the band, had all but destroyed his goodwill.  It always struck me as odd that Cornell would sink so low.  After all, he was a principle songwriter in the band and his first solo album turned out to be strong effort.  I was content to just listen to Soundgarden’s handful of albums over and over again.<br /><br />  But I’m happy to announce that all fears have been swiftly vanquished by Soundgarden’s triumphant reunion album, King Animal.  If King Animal doesn’t have the same impact as Soundgarden’s one two punch, Badmotorfinger and Superunknown, then that’s a testament to the impossible quality of those two albums than a reflection on the latest album.  In fact, listening to King Animal is a little like falling back in love with grunge music, a genre that rock radio has done its best to water down with helpings of imitators.  But the fact that King Animal handily decimates memories of Creed and Nickleback tells you all you need to know about the album.<br /><br />  Unlike other grunge contemporaries, like Nirvana or Mudhoney, Soundgarden was less devout to punk.  Instead their music felt like the natural inheritors of 70s arena filling rock gods, Led Zeppelin.  But unlike some of those bands in the 70s and 80s, Soundgarden always knew to avoid excess when necessary.  At a time when garage rock is making something of a small resurgence, it’s actually refreshing to hear a band that sounds like its aiming for those sitting the cheap seats.  And there are plenty of songs on King Animal that have that epic feel, as if Thayil is conjuring a symphony out of his six strings.  During songs like “A Thousand Days Before” each band member seems completely in sync with one another until the final horn crescendo.  The album reminded me that Soundgarden really understood how to do big without tipping over into bombast.<br /><br />  King Animal is also a testament to Soundgarden’s ability to paint in the corners.  While the band has always been able write pop hooks and to go heavy when necessary, they also are comfortable in the studio, adding layers to their music without diminishing its impact.  When a chorus spins around again, the band might use a slight effect on Cornell’s vocals or let the song devolve into chaos during the bridge.  There are always more details for a listener to sift through, and their ability to match an attention to detail with heavy hooks has always made Soundgarden’s music just as appropriate for your car’s stereo as it is for an expensive pair of headphones.<br /><br />That’s not to say the band hasn’t changed in the intervening years.  (Although the fact that “Non-State Actor” sounds like a caged animal trying to get free shows they’ve maintained some of their rough edges).  Cornell’s voice isn’t as piercing as it once was, even if it has held up surprisingly well.  The songs themselves sound like they were written by veterans rather than young bunks.  But instead of running from age, the band has come to embrace growing older.  Singing about wallowing in “mud and blood” and searching with his “good eye closed,” Cornell’s lyrics often had a suitably Old Testament heaviness that matched the band’s predilection for the lower end.  But here Cornell finds the space to ruminate on impending middle age.  On “Bones of Birds” he sings, “Time is my friend 'til it ain't and runs out / And that is all that I have 'til it's gone,” suggesting that Cornell is aware that everything we have, our talents, our relationship, and our lives all come with an expiration date.  Tellingly, the album closes on the song “Rowing,” which relies on the harmonies of old time work songs.  Together the band sings, “Don't know where I'm going, I just keep on rowing / I just keep on pulling, gotta row.”  And if that isn’t a perfect approach to doing what you love and living your life, then I don’t know what is.  Let’s hope it means that King Animal is just the first step in a new era for Soundgarden.
B002A9VJ40|4.0|I never saw Top Gun before, yet heard it was a classic. The poor chemistry between Tom Cruise and his romantic interest was not only disappointing but distractingly bad. The movie was redeemed somewhat by the fabulous acting Cruise exhibited in regards to the raw grief his character experienced and his portrayal of the character's angst as he wrestled with the complicated relationship he had with his father's legacy.

0307279189|5.0|The book is much more than just a discourse on why you should run barefoot style. It is a great story and leaves me wondering why people wear heeled shoes at all.<br /><br />I am now an ardent convert to heeless shoes and my back is so much the better for it.
B003Y5H59C|5.0|This movie is fun.  It catches you a bit off guard if you don't know what it's about but it's very enjoyable.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|When I saw the news that Chris had been killed, I bought the book - I wanted to make some, any contribution to help him, and the ideals he stood for. I wasn't expecting much honestly, the man was a warrior, not an author.<br /><br />The book was surprisingly good. Excellent really.<br />What I found intriguing was Chris's personal struggles to keep his marriage together, his worries about his wife, which made him all the more human as opposed to the &#34;invincible GI-Joe&#34; often portrayed in similar books.<br /><br />I could see Chris really struggled to find a niche after leaving the SEALS, because when that is all you have known in your adult life, how do you adapt those skills for peace-time?<br />I hope anyone reading this book will be inspired, and perhaps follow Chris's example and serve in our military.

B005URRCUY|3.0|I really liked this at first. But it seems that after a few listens it seems old already. Maybe because most is \\"Borrowed\\" riffs.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was told this was the new twilight. So figured I would never read it. I am so glad they were wrong! Amazing book, very well written, and a true joy to read. Thank you Ms. Collins for giving the world this beautiful series.
159448385X|5.0|I needed this book for school It came here when I expected it to, and it was cheap- I got it new. The used ones are even cheaper. I wish they shipped on weekends though.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Full language version of the series has rich and entertaining dialogues. The Special features addition is well done and extremely entertaining
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Never been much of a zombie anything fan. This series is better than anything else out there. Has depth in characters and storyline, and the writers are not afraid to kill off anybody. Keeps you guessing.
B0099G3I96|2.0|My wife and I have seen them in concert and own every one of their CDs.  We are pretty easy for the picking - just give us something solid and you've won us over.  I haven't been this disappointed in an album since Metallica's St. Anger.<br /><br />The production is all over the place and it shows they wanted a big, new sound.  The result seems like an off fusion restaurant.  It has some dub beats, some classic sounds, and a little bit of a lot of different things.  At the end, you feel confused and unsatisfied.  Particularly for an artist, I think it's critical you know what you want to be.  I think they have lost some direction.<br /><br />We winced through a full listen of the CDs, at times cringing, laughing, and exchanging blank looks of confusion.  Every band has their time and I think it's safe to say that theirs has passed.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Glad I started watching this series.<br /><br />wonderful to be able to go from 1 episode to the next without waiting.
B005GSY23M|5.0|I was neutral on the movie Drive cinematically, but ended up loving it overall because the soundtrack.  It perfectly captures the somber, electronic throwback vibe the movie strove for.<br /><br />When I am in a 'in-between' state of mind (i.e. not happy or sad, just chill), this is the perfect set of tracks.  I absolutely love it for driving, particularly in Seattle, where you have tons of gray days.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|In my opinion, this remake tries too much to feel like Bladerunner instead of trying to carve out it's own dystopian vision of the future. The 1990 Total Recall was at least fun. This version was rather taxing.
B0013GH9AO|5.0|The lyrics are fairly lude, sexist, and abrasiveness - but 2001 is an all-time classic album.  With 4 rock solid singles, a number of funny skits, and a lot of great tier-2 tracks, 2001 is a must own for any rap fan.<br /><br />I guess you should probably listen to these on a pair of 'Beat by Dr. Dre' but they sound just as good on my Bose. :)
B008ASLK8A|3.0|I liked the first Sherlock Holmes film with Downey Jr. The sequel seems to be lacking the mystery present in the first film. Game of Shadows wasn't bad, but it wasn't as fun viewing as it's predecessor.
B001FXCE46|5.0|This is the best Kings of Leon album - period.  We own them all and have seen them in concert.  The hipsters will point to their more raw earlier work which they liked before they became famous.  The rest of us can simply enjoy this masterpiece.<br /><br />Just like there is Christmas music, we have summer music.  With the tops down and the sun out, Kings of Leon is the most perfect summer album I have ever heard.<br /><br />We have listened to this album literally over 100 times and it remains one of our alltime favorites.  It's so good I already have the CD, but bought the album just to send a little more money their way (and I also have a stack of 200+ CDs to rip into Amazon Cloud Player)
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|I haven't really enjoyed the James Bond series since GoldenEye. I've tried watching the successive films, but couldn't get into them. In general, I've walked away from each of the additional Bond films feeling like there's something missing. Skyfall came out, and I heard many positive reviews about this latest installment in the Bond series. I rented it, but became bored with Skyfall within the first 15 minutes. There was nothing to captivate me, nothing to wow me, and nothing to reward my attempt to commit the storyline. I have to be honest and say, in my opinion, that Daniel Craig sucks the life out of EVERY character he plays in EVERY movie he stars in. So, maybe it's not Skyfall, but Daniel Craig I don't care for.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|I own about 10 or so Sinatra albums, mostly CDs I have uploaded to the cloud.  While the studio recordings are amazing, he is amazing live.  This was recorded in Vegas in 1966, putting him at 51 years old.  I would say that he was in his prime at this point.<br /><br />Why this is a great buy:<br />1. You get 22 tracks for a great price<br />2. It's Sinatra in his Prime in Vegas in his prime<br />3. He adds some back stories and jokes in between songs.  It's adds a nice element of authenticity<br /><br />While Rat Pack singers will always remind me of casual Italian chain restaurants (because so many of them play them on loop), you just can't argue with Sinatra.  And this is him at his finest.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had me from the beginning. It kept me wanting to know more about Sky and Holder's life. Their relationship was so intense in many levels and I couldn't help but feel for them. Such whirlwind of emotion to the end. Loved this book!
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Not great...barely good.  For a book to take so long to come out after his last....did not live up to expectations.
1939416019|5.0|Really enjoyed this book-read it in very short time -was hard to put down.  I would recommend this book to all age levels, youth to grandparents. If you like scifi/fantasy this is a really good read.  Could use some editing but \\"get over it\\"  and just enjoy the book.
B0095ZMMCK|2.0|Even though the enemy was far superior, a series of stupid mistakes expose them and it ends as 99% of Hollywood movies. It was entertained to read, but the ending was disappointing.
B00A4EDAN6|5.0|This album is the best since So Jealous and might be it's equal. It has a different sound than the previous records, but I think that shows the growth of Tegan and Sara. This is the first album where all songs were co-written by the Canadian twins and the collaboration shows. So Jealous is one of my favorite records of all time, and Sainthood was almost as addicting. This album is equal to both and may be even more addicting up front.  It's poppy, it's catchy, it's hard to stop listening!  Every track is great and there is no track that warrants a skip. Definitely worth checking out. PS- I own the CD and the vinyl. I recommend picking this up on vinyl if you have a turntable. Great album!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|It was pretty good movie.  Had no problems while watching.  I do kind of think $4.00 is a little steep to rent when Red Box is only a dollar. I'd rent again again though from Amazon. Well done!!
B004SH40BQ|5.0|This was recommended by a friend. It's a great product and paired with the headphones, it has worked out great.
B001P8B8R0|4.0|Got for my grandson.  He liked it a lot but was a little smaller than I thought it would be but still a very nice toy.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|cute movie, i personally thought it would be funnier.  But it has a very good story line and it does keep you on the edge of your seat!
B003L77FYS|5.0|Castle: The Complete Third Season, is so good!! Castle is one of the best shows on TV. This third season is funny, exciting and always entertaining.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I rented this from amazon, it is the best movie I have seen in a while, it is very comparable to bridesmaids.  It is very funny and a bit crude so pg-13 is a very appropriate rating. I would watch it if I were you.
B00000IQW5|5.0|Always is a great movie and a classic at that. Was definitely happy with my purchase and was glad to share the movie with someone who hadn't seen it.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|It literally took me less than 10 minutes to renew my contract and upgrade to a new Galaxy Note II, and this phone happened to cost $50 less than if I went through my wireless carrier's site for the same deal.  I had nothing but trouble trying to do the same deal on my carrier's website, causing me stress about when I might be able to go into a store to get this within the grace period...then my fiance found Amazon Wireless.  I will definitely come here again in two years.
0307895475|4.0|This guide has helped me out quite a bit since I purchased it.  It's a tome of knowledge and weighs in at around 700 pages or so.
0385474547|5.0|If you have not read it, get and start on it right away. If you have, read it again and again. I have read it for the tenth time, and for the tenth time, I learned different things.<br /><br />Every word in the books means a lot.<br /><br />I will continue to recommend this gem by a visionary--Achebe.
B00AE2J93I|4.0|A great kids flick that isn't all gumdrops and candy canes.  Yes, the jock character is gay, and that's something that people who are uncomfortable discussing love with their kids will have to deal with.  Horror fans will really get a kick out of all the little homages that appear throughout the film while enjoying a decent story.
B00AY0A71I|5.0|Just a fun romp with wonderful actors. Ireally enjoyed Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis...all actors were great. Highly recommend this.
0985081821|4.0|I'm not usually one for romance, so I was a little hesitant to pick up this book. I'm glad I did! The story was very interesting. At one point I thought I had figured out what a forever girl was, but later found out I was completely wrong. I like books that aren't too predictable. While there are definitely elements of romance, it wasn't overwhelming. I never thought oh my god I'm going to puke from all the sappy lovey dovey crap that is in some romance novels. The characters seemed well developed, even the supporting ones. The only negative I can think of is it's a bit Earth centric. As things are explained at the end of the book there isn't room for intelligent life on any other planet, so only we on Earth can save the Universe from destruction. As this is a fantasy novel I can overlook that, as in *this* universe there actually might not be any other intelligent life around. Perhaps including the possibility of aliens is a bit more sci-fi than the author wants to go. I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|This book was very entertaining to read and provided a wealth of information about how the mind works.<br />Congratulations on a great book!
B0084AZXKK|1.0|Lame and the story got really boring a quarter of the way through. Also it got confusing at parts during it
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I loved this book. I laughed & cried out loud. I couldn't put it down. Can't wait to read the next!
B005GHN2GG|4.0|Great stand-alone book. However, it'd be great if this was turned into a series. I really liked the world-building, and I liked the characters. The author is a good writer, with smooth dialogue, engaging characters, and an interesting plot. Well worth the price.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I enjoyed this book and it was a very quick read. Definitely for the younger readers.  Overall good story. Unsure where the story will go from here, but not overly compelled to read the next one.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|If you're pondering on whether or not you should watch Lost Girl, I'm just going to tell you to go ahead and do it.  Seriously, it's a really good show that has very diverse characters.  It's a show that will continually keep you guessing the first season and then it gets even better the second and third seasons.  If you like fantasy, sci-fi, etc. this is the show for you.  Enjoy!
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|THIS IS JUST THE FIRST BUT STILL ITS THE OPPOSITE OF DUMB!!!!!!!! IT IS SO VERY VERY VERY VERY COOL!!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|What a great read. Servicemen can really relate. Its a shame he was taken while trying to help a fellow vet.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I LOVED this story!!Both thoughtful and yet AMAZING to read! There had been so much detail it was as if I was the one to tell the story! This will be a memorable and thoughtful book to read  again and again!
B004YKSXYW|3.0|This is written at a 4-5th grade level, or for those with very short attention spans. Lots of &#34;imagine yourself... how would you feel if that happened to you?&#34; stuff interjected throughout the stories. I'd give it to my nephew.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I chose 5 stars because it was very funny<br />Jeff Kinney has done it again he brings out the best books
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't wait for Season 4 can't write anymore without giving away details  - found it very convenient ordering on line then viewing at my leisure
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun and fast paced easy games. Great for someone with a short attention span. It's definitely a great time passer.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I would order from the company again  This was a very good book.<br />I have read this book in two days and was very pleased with the shipper. This book was bought new and was delivered in a timely manner.  I will continue to order from this company.
B000NJMJGG|5.0|Love this movie and could never find it in my state, glad I found it here! I am def. Happy with my purchase, thanks so much.

B007BT0RKG|1.0|It doesn't give you turn by turn directions . It just pinpoints more or less where its at on the map. I downloaded it then deleted it .
B002APU580|5.0|Love this version of Austen's Pride and Prejudice!!  Very romantic!  More modern version and made for viewers today.  Makes my daughters want to crawl through the tv set and just live in the era!!
B008RJFRTK|1.0|I thought it would be better than the MapsWithMe Lite . Its the same thing . Not all the streets show. Not worth the price I paid just to turn around and delete it .
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is a great game for little kids. Lots of fun. My daughter loves it to pieces. Love the way it creates its own story.
B000I9TY4G|5.0|Exciting action, love story and good guy bad guy story line.  The characters are well developed, the acting is superb.  If you like the old westerns you'll appreciate this.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is a really fun game for my 8 year old.  He says it is just like the first Temple Run, but it has more obstacles.  It is a decent challenge, but not frustrating.
B000I9UA30|5.0|Well done action movie, entertainment at it's best.  I'm partial to good guys beating the bad guys at their own game.
B000BISBDY|5.0|fast response thank AS in all my responses  I loved the music  Don't like to type a certain number words to say that Love It
B00A11AN6O|3.0|I found this difficult to use at first but kept with it and it got a little easier. I still use it
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Just fine for a free game. Yay for mindless repetition! I like it and you know you like it, homies!!
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Absolutely love the series, best one in a long long time.  When you least expect it, something happens, and you are left pondering, &#34;what just happened??????&#34;  Keeps you on the edge of your seat!!!
0446554995|4.0|Readers of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child's previous Pendergast novels will be happy that the Helen Pendergast Trilogy beginning with [[ASIN:0446554952 Fever Dream]] and [[ASIN:0446554979 Cold Vengeance]] concludes with this latest offering entitled, \\"Two Graves.\\"  Those expecting the authors to change tack and create a novel that doesn't suspend belief more than occasionally, doesn't repeatedly describe their strange, competent and death-defying protagonist as \\"the man in black,\\" doesn't move the larger story ahead for beloved repeat characters and doesn't link odd factoids together to connect the dots in a way that juxtaposes suppositional conspiracy theories with paranormal activity do not want to read a Pendergast novel.<br /><br />In \\"Two Graves,\\" Preston and Child deliver the expected:  an entertaining romp through different parts of the world where deep, dark skeletons are uncovered and diabolical control freaks engineer humans and creatures to forward their agenda.  Wearing his white hat proudly, is the man in black: the super cognitive Aloysius Pendergast--his fellow deputies Vincent D'Agosta, Constance Greene and Corrie Swanson are ready and willing to do his bidding no matter how illegal, outlandish or dangerous the request.  Solving the mystery behind Pendergast's wife's so-called death spurs our favorite FBI agent on literarily from the last pages of \\"Cold Vengeance\\" to rescue his loved one and uncover the \\"why\\" behind the actions of the neo-Nazi group called the Conclave.  Without revealing any of the crucial plot twists or their resolutions, suffice it to say that Pendergast will be surprised yet again by his wife's history and the reason behind all the clandestine activities.<br /><br />The secondary stories spin off in other directions as Dr. Felder looks into Constance's past and a compromised Corrie Swanson takes refuge with her estranged father.  As this reviewer listened to this novel as an audiobook--actor Rene Auberjonois does as fine a job of narrating \\"Graves\\" as he does with all the Pendergast books on audio--the breaks in the Pendergast-related action did not come with any exclamations of \\"Oh, No,\\" or twinges of disappointment.  As with the other Preston and Child novels, the secondary players and their side stories are cultivated to provide necessary backdrops to future happenings in already conceived future novels.  What fun! If only Preston and Child would resurrect the incorrigible Bill Smithback!  All the Pendergast novels are perfect to listen to while exercising as their fast-paced action motivates the reader to keep calm and carry on.<br /><br />Bottom line?  \\"Two Graves\\" is the next episode in the saga of one of popular literatures most enigmatic characters:  Aloysius Pendergast.  Despite some occurrences and coincidences that stress the reader's patience at times, the novel completes the Helen Trilogy and brings new hope into the wily FBI agent's life with the same frenetic momentum of the other books featuring him.  The lives of Corrie Swanson and Constance Greene are further explored with new ground laid for future adventures and revelations.  Recommended for all Pendergast fans.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />\\"reneofc\\"of narrating \\"Graves\\" as he does with all the Pendergast books on audio--the breaks in the Pendergast-related action did not come with any exclamations of \\"Oh, No,\\" or twinges of disappointment.

B007EECSFA|5.0|It grabbed my attention from the beginning and continued to increasingly absorb until the surprising end.  Did not want to stop reading.
B00BHMF578|5.0|I lived in Tehran during the Revolution and this was a good replication of the tension and fear that existed then. I could tell that it was filmed in Istanbul because the streets and residences weren't quite the same. The screenplay provided a thrilling ride. Were they going to get out or weren't they? -- a ridiculous question since we already know the answer! All the same, I was on the edge of my seat wondering what could go wrong. I remember the joy and relief we all felt when we left Iranian air space, and the joy the six &#34;film makers&#34; demonstrated was so evocative. Tony Mendez was very brave and creative. There aren't many movies I give five stars to, but I enjoyed this one so much, it deserves them.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|In this season, it turns into a full blown soap opera including amnesia, unexpected affairs, mysterious murders, and Ouija boards (I'm not kidding).  A big turn for the worse compared to Season 1, but the characters are still interesting and I'll still tune into Season 3 in the hopes of it improving.<br /><br />This season is very predicable.  I challenge you before you begin to consider the history taking place, try to guess what will happen in the entire season for each character, and I bet you are not far off.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I don't watch much TV and never watch the soaps. This series really sucked me in. Been staying up too late at night to watch it. The actors realy make you feel for them.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Love Mr Miller, and Lucy Liu!  Was never a big fan of hers, but have really enjoyed her in this series.  Johnny Miller as Sherlock, is fascinating to watch!  Well recommended
B004J4XGN6|4.0|Clean narratives and examples were given throughout the book to help me grant the author authority on this subject so I recommend it to anyone wanting to scale their enterprise beyond limits of traditional methods
B00198X0VS|4.0|I love Will Smith, so what can I say...I buy every movie he is in. I like this series, it makes me laugh. The first was better than this one, but I still enjoyed it.
B009POCG2C|4.0|Not as good as Grand Torino, but still a darned good film! I don't want to like Justin Timberlake, because of his Pop music, Boy Band BS, past, but the kid has some chops. Good sound and picture. But i expect that, now days. More important it's a good story, well put into film.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Good plot lines, twists on the original story, excellent acting. I'm hooked!  Looking forward to season two.<br /><br />Wish I could have bought the entire season for one price instead of episodes one by one, pain in the __ to re-enter your code for each one. Enjoy!
B004EPZ0BG|4.0|Defintely not the most realistc dvd out there.  But it moves at a good pace and the main characters are amusing even if the female recruiter is unusually agressive in her methods and language.Not the type of lady(and I use the word loosely) that a self respecting many would date.  But maybe Justin Timberlake's character is lacking in that area as well as intimacy.<br /><br />You know how the movie is going to end shortly after the beginning.  However, the little twists and turns along the way definitely make it an interesting ride.  The female recruiter's mom is especially amusing as a free spirited soul who has not truly found her soul mate.<br /><br />This is not Oscar material by any means but its a light romantic comedy/drama which will keep you interested.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|still trying to figure out this app. I signed up but am unable to access the daily plans on my cruz tablet. Will have to work with it to understand how to get ahead and just flip thru like a regular bible instead of starting with genesis. Like having all the different versions to choose from. Just need to figure how to get back and forth.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Not since The Soprano's on HBO, have I enjoyed a television show or series so much!  Homeland is outstanding.  It has excellent acting.  It has excellent writing.<br />The story is gripping, compelling, and interesting.  I have only viewed season one, but it is an instant classic.  I have even subscribed to Showtime so I can<br />watch season 2 and season 3.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This is a great way to stay in touch with your friends as well follow your favorite stars, businesses, etc.
B005NPCJ88|4.0|These guys are pretty dern talented and have some really good tracks. But I can't help but feel that they are not put as much (musically) into the music as they can. They have some really good solos, but they are so sporadic and some so short that I feel they could do better. I play guitar so I know writing a long solo is not easy for people on my level. But these guys are worlds away from my level of playing music and I would just like to hear them at their full potential.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I do not play this kind of game but my grandkids grab my Kindle when they come over and they really seem to like this kind of stuff
B00AJLHUYO|5.0|I enjoy a good thriller, and at the same time I'm not picky.  I don't hone in on some factors that makes others overly critical of horror movies/thrillers.  As a frame of reference, before Sinister, the two movies over the past decade or so that have creeped me out to a similar level were The Ring and Paranormal Activity (the first movies of both series).  Sinister is a genuinely creepy, chilling type of movie. Little to no gore, little to no profanity, no nudity -- just images and sounds that are downright creepy. I'm typically not the type to see a movie multiple times in the theatre, but like The Ring and Paranormal Activity, this was one I saw multiple times both for my own enjoyment and to show it to others to see their reactions to the creepiest parts!  Just like any &#34;mainstream&#34; horror/thriller movie, there are bound to be critics, but in my view this is an all-time great as far as creepy movies go!
B000ICXQGK|5.0|This is an excellent depiction on what has been reported about the After Life experience, from various sources over the years. Both &#34;heaven&#34; and &#34;hell&#34; are of our own making, depending on our state of consciousness. Life continues at a higher  energy vibration (quantum physics supported). We do not escape from our beliefs, values, personal history. It behooves all of us to heal ourselves and our relationships while in the physical experience. Highly recommended.
B00B2G4O2G|4.0|Kevin Bacon always does a good job. At the end of each episode you are anxious to see what will happen next.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My grandson is 6 years old.  There are not a lot of games for him.<br />He really loves this one.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|What can I say that has not been said before. A piece of movie history. Just make sure you have the time to watch it through.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I have no idea - husband downloaded it onto MY Kindle which was my Christmas gift from him.  Guess who pretty much owns it now?!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Rothfuss writes a complex story with compelling characters.  The story is engaging.  I am working on the second book and will be eagerly awaiting the final one.  He doesn't follow the same path that many fantasy stories do and I appreciate the twists he throws in.  A very good read.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|This game is my sons favorite by far, he really wants the plush toy now. I enjoy playing this too!
B009ICQ6KO|5.0|Here I go again about to reveal my ignorance on a subject.  I was not familiar with Charlie Musselwhite before I listened to GET UP!  That said, I think he complements Ben Harper very well indeed.  On the DVD Mr. Musselwhite talks about Muddy Waters and having known him in Chicago.  I've read about Muddy Waters and know the harmonica player he worked with for years was Little Walter.  It made me wonder if Mr. Musselwhite knew him, too.  At any rate this CD is yet another example of Ben Harper's talent for immersing himself in a sound and being able to interpret it in his own fashion.  His songwriting skills are at their very best. DON'T LOOK TWICE has a bluesy twang that gets your heart pumping.  I'M IN I'M OUT AND I'M GONE is kind of gutbucket blues. WE CAN'T END THIS WAY has a gospel flavor.  I DON'T BELIEVE A WORD YOU SAY is an anthem to lies, lies, and more lies whether they be from your lover or a politician. YOU FOUND ANOTHER LOVER (I LOST ANOTHER FRIEND) with just Ben on the guitar and Mr. Musselwhite playing the harmonica is possibly my favorite song.  It's heartfelt.  I RIDE AT DAWN is the most beautiful song to our men and women in uniform that I've heard in a long time. BLOOD SIDE OUT is just rockin' good.  I'm a dancing fool on that one. GET UP! carries on the rocking good time but's a bit more mellow blues.  SHE GOT KICK is bluesy country in my opinion.  And ALL THAT MATTERS NOW plucks at the heartstrings.  It's sad and profound when you finally find out what really matters in life.  Great job Mr. Harper and Mr. Musselwhite.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Though artist liberties were taken with the series, I love it none the less,  i have found the show to be very entertaining, and intriguing!
B007PKDW44|5.0|This was my first earful of Volbeat and I really enjoyed there mix of styles! Most all the songs are really goood in my book! Well made CD.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I have no idea - husband downloaded it onto MY Kindle which was my Christmas gift from him.  Guess who pretty much owns it now?!
B00932A3SK|4.0|Plot was original with many unexpected twists. Acting was good. Very entertaining. Not quite tied together and gorier than needed (reason it missed the last star).
B003ES61EE|5.0|This is a great product, a must buy for any photographer, profession or not, buy it, you will love this little guy!
B004H6P2O2|4.0|I had expected more problems with this 1990s recording. I had the Vienna Maazel first. There I had some trouble with woodwind players. The Orchestra I like better this time.<br /><br />Compared to say Davis, the non symphony works are also worth a listen. I gave the Vienna set and this the same points, but the 2nd is better at Vienna. The 5th and 6th I prefer this one. In fact, this 6th is as good as V&auml;nsk&auml; at Helsinki, my benchmark.<br /><br />If you get both sets, it should cover the symphonies for Maazel, mix and match. I did that for the iPod playlist.
B00BESCJII|5.0|This was a great movie, almost as good as the book but it didn't fall flat like most. Keeps you watching until the end which has an awesome twist.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|We enjoyed the film. It was quirky and funny....had Dame Helen Mirren in it. Would watch it again! We watched, &#34;The Lady Vanishes&#34;, the next night and enjoyed it all the more. I would recommend both films very highly.
B009O2XY12|3.0|I have no idea - husband downloaded it onto MY Kindle which was my Christmas gift from him.  Guess who pretty much owns it now?!
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|I loved the breadth and depth of Paul Tough's exploration of the lives of children and the many different kinds of adults who have tried to figure out how to help more of them succeed.  He discusses a wide range of theories and ideas about human development  and weaves them into a remarkably readable book.  Drawing from experiments and observations including the marshmallow test, chess, Flow, and mother rats of varying degree of effectiveness, he interweaves the stories of children and educators from both the poorest schools and the wealthiest. Tough takes a broad and thoughtful look at some of the most complex and compelling issues of our time--how to help more of the most fragile and vulnerable members of our society--out youngest and poorest members--succeed. A must read for educators and policymakers.
B0037NVM2C|5.0|I'm a great fan of the Terminator series and have liked every one of them.  I highly recommend them to those who like action and science fiction.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great continuation to an already terrific story.  Can't wait for the next season to start.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am litterally addicted... IM IN LOVE WITH THIS GAME it is so fun and I love getting mystery boxes and buying them too.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This is really quite handy.  I find myself almost always using it instead of tuning into \\"weather on the eights\\" unless there is some major local weather phenomenon going on.  I do wish it had a \\"current, one day, three day, a week\\" setting; the ten day forecast is almost always wrong.  But it's there immediately, I don't have to wait for it when \\"on the eights\\" arrives on the nines or even later, there are no commercials, and it's free.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is excellent and you won't believe the shocking ending!  Downton gets better as it goes, can't wait for season 4!!
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|I PREFERRED JOSH's previous recordings featuring a mix of English and foreign languages.  He does the romantic languages so well.
B00153ZC8Q|5.0|I have been addicted to the Terminator movies since seeing my first one.  I love the action, the characters, and just about everything about them.  I'd recommend them to anyone who likes science fiction.
B0012VP8MQ|5.0|This is the movie that made Eddie Murphy a standout comedy star of exceptional talent. The chemistry between Nick Nolte<br />and Murphy was palpable. For Murphy fans, this is a must!
B008OOYALE|1.0|my whole screen is light blue and I cant get it back to the regular color! love the game hats the bugs!!!!!!!!!!!!!I really hope they fix this because I play that game all the time!&lt;3
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Great production and an endearing look into English life. Sterling performances and a great storyline share an insight into village life.
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|Been a Fan of Accuradio.com for several years, and their entry into the \\"ANDROID\\" and \\"I\\" technology markets was a long awaited, and now, welcome treat!<br /><br />Was easy to purchase in Amazon.com's Android App Store, downloaded to one of my \\"Kindle Fires\\", giving it an immediate 'Test Drive'. All the Music Channels were there for a 'one-tap' access. As a veteran Accuradio.com listener, I did not notice an option for \\"Signing In,\\" or \\"Logging Out\\" to provide access to \\"Mixing Channels\\" and \\"Saving\\". If I did not overlook these general Accuradio.com features, perhaps they'll be added in 'Updates'.<br /><br />Accuradio.com offers, and allows User selected diversity, and variety without any hassles, or purposely designed substitute prefab imitations--Music by, & of original Artists/Musicians--along with 'New Comers\\" and \\"Indie\\" Performers...<br /><br />--GBJ
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|As one who traveled India, I found this book to be a riveting tale of survival in difficult circumstances, and positive journey of realization.
B00AZQ4VMC|5.0|this is an entirely fresh album of music from bryan ferry, and even though they are based on the original roxy music songs, unless you knew them really well it would be hard to tell. lovely 20s jazz.
B00B49L7JY|4.0|It is interesting to learn how a forgotten singer had a huge impact on the anti-apartheid movement (but intersting that his audience was almost all white). Movie is a bit clunky in its structure but worth seeing.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Amazing, gets your blood plumbing for more and more as you read! A book that you never want to put down [:
B0091V6TF4|5.0|Great gift of music for all, but especially for those that love James Bond.  My husband is difficult to buy for and he love this collection!
B00338QENI|3.0|Kind of a hard book to read.  it skips around a lot and makes the Lacks family look kind of bad which I feel further disrespects the family.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|if you like action with a story or a Bond fan for past 50yrs this is a must see!!! Take time and watch enjoy like a good wine
B00992CF6W|5.0|the mincraft is awesome I love it but my mom wont let me get it but I delly want it because its awosom (((((
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I had seen the film and needed more- this novel definitely delivers substance, philosophically and physically. I read it cover to cover in no time. A great set of characters and situations!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|To spite knowing the ending it is an edge of your seat thriller of a movie! Well done!!! I was captivated from beginning to end!
B009FBX5M0|4.0|Great CD except that the song that is most popular from the movie is not included on the sound track.  Do not expect that Adele's song will be on it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I usually do not stay up late getting caught up in a book, but I found myself unable to sleep in order to finish this book!  The plot twists are unbelievable and I am just in love with every character in this book.  Highly recommend it, now I'm on the third in the series.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I just love this App!  I did not know about it until I was reading &#34;Kindle Fire HD User's Guide Book&#34;.  In this book that I downloaded, it had a section of great apps to get.  This was one of them.  The battery filled with a blue liquid shows exactly how much life you have left before you need to recharge.  It tells you the overall percentage and then on the bottom it will tell you how many hours for Music Playback, Video Playback, Internet Browsing (WiFi or Mobile) and Talk time.  The next four pages have much more further info concerning the battery life.  This makes it so much easier to judge the little icon in the upper corner of the Kindle.  I also like the addition of the little bubbles that show in the battery, just a neat addition.
B00B1CGD5M|4.0|After a strong return to form with resemblance of earlier works in TPB, Soilwork has again lost Wichers with this new album. That, however, does not take away from the classical &#34;soilwork&#34; sound that we have all come to enjoy. The thing that is curious about Soilwork as compared to many other bands left over from the 'Gothenburg' era, is that, while other bands make the same album 3-5 times, then switch their form ( ala the likes of In Flames, The Haunted, or Amorphis) Each one of Soilwork's albums are quite different. This Difference leads to of course polarizing viewpoints on which album is 'best'. I for one beleive each must be sampled independently to be enjoyed.<br /><br />The new album from Soilwork then, is no doubt, one to be enjoyed like the rest. The particular nuances that we can equate with the classic soilwork sound are all present and accounted for. The band nowadays only has 2 members from its original line-up, to include Flink, and Strid. Somewhat newer additions in Verbeuren, Andersson, and Coudret however make their presence felt heavily. To be fair, many of the songs in fact bring a 'Scarve&#34;-like quality to them ( acknowledging Sylvain Coudret's prior focus) however this does not mean for one second that this is a detrimental thing.  Both albums have well balanced tracks, The living Inifinite parts I and II, Leech, Misanthrope, Rise above the sentiment etc are all standouts for initial listening, and then the rest of the albums multilayered nuances begin to appear. Strid's clean vocals are layered and produced and the album has a finely tuned, tight and neat production focus. One could argue the production actually may even be almost too high quality and less visceral than previous efforts, but for this album I believe that this was warranted. It seems the new focus has minimized solos again, almost similar to FNF. When examining TPB with the dueling between Coudret and Wichers, much of this is not heavily present in the new album. In that fact could be this work's one and only criticism.<br /><br />Overall a very strong showing from the Swedish Powerhouse that is Soilwork.that fact could be this work's one and only criticism.<br /><br />Overall a very strong showing from the Swedish Powerhouse that is Soilwork.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have made it through the first two seasons in four days!  I can't wait to start on season 3!
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|takes forever to load up and wen it do it just shuts down. very disappointing I was soooooo looking forward to playing this. one of my fav books and movies.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This was a good book. I'm glad that I picked it up and learned more about the life of a SEAL.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is one of the most realistic games Ive seen., and with really good interaction.,  anyone who has a love of horses will enjoy it
B008G12ERC|4.0|I didn't love this CD until after I had seen Muse in concert (2nd Law Tour) several times.  After hearing the music live I understood what was and wasn't coming across on the CD.  The CD is a sterile version of this glorious music.
B00AO2ZMB6|5.0|Him...A bad guy? No way!!! This show is more toward the adult audience but it will keep u on your seat if you havent seen it before. A lot of twists and turns through the whole series.
B006LSZECO|4.0|If it weren't for a couple of caricature characters--most notably Desi--I would have given this novel 5 stars all the way.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is one of the best things created for television in the past decade.  Each episode leaves one wanting to lean into the next.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|These ho/adventure games are great they help me pass the time thanks g5 job well done keep it up.t y
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|love it . we play it every day on my phone and tablet we have 2 phone and 2 tablet . we cant stop playing it .
032147404X|2.0|Scott Kelby starts each chapter with a page and a half of fabrications about photography and then laughs at the reader for trying to learn it.  While he does include valuable information about photography, after the third practical joke of reading a bunch of weird misinformation that was untrue and misleading and then being told &#34;ha,ha, I tricked you again!&#34; I deleted the book and bought one by Jim Hamer.  I hated Kelbys mocking writing style, and found it confusing and frustrating.  What was his editor thinking?
1616550414|4.0|I got the book a day earlier than expected.  But the book binding was not done well and several pages began to fall out.  However, I was able to exchange it for a new one and have not experienced any other problems at all.<br /><br />A franchise as successful as Legend of Zelda deserves to have a book like this in my opinion.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Could not put it down and with a little twist at the end that I did not expect.  Loved it!
0439023521|5.0|The world is well developed, the characters are interesting, and the action is realistic and exciting. I have no complaints.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I bought the book because I'm a gardener as well as an avid reader and was looking for something &#34;different&#34;.  It WAS different.  The somewhat unlikeable protagonist was actually very likeable.  It was a relationship/love/growing up and out story that was entertaining reading.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|WILLIAM SHATNERS OVER THE TOP PERFORMANCES ARE GREAT AND THE SUPPORTING CAST ARE A THING OF BEAUTY. TO BAD THE NETWORK DIDNT KNOW THE JEWEL THEY HAD ON THERE HANDS AT THE TIME.
B00A0L7PE8|5.0|Love this CD.....great energetic music from Prince.  Happy music to play in your car or to do your exercise routine. Great variety of sounds and his singing sounds excellent.  He performed this song on the Jimmy K. Show with great exuberance in October.  Keep working Prince!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Really good game. Bought other minecraft games but they all sucked. I wasn't sure about buying it for $7.00 but I'm happy I did. Buy it.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Show should never have be canceled Joss Wedon is a brilliant writer/director.The shows cast meshes so well they make you want to know what happened to them after the show ended
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was told these books were pornographic.  I thought they were sexy, exciting and a great storyline.  Loved them all
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subway suffers is great because I can play with my friends and enjoy after a hard day if school so I think it is a great game
B001AG52AG|4.0|Begs for a sequel, so I bought the books. Love the characters, though. It's slightly difficult to understand all of the intrigue due to the speed of speech in the English accent. The heroine does the best job of all, so no problem for the kids. I just hate endings that feel like there should be more and there is no way to get to it.
B003VWU2WA|5.0|I like it.  Simple and durable.  I am just trying to get 17 words in here now.  One two three
B00063EMJ6|4.0|The CD itself arrived intact - albeit shipping took a long time.  The outside of the CD jewel case was however cracked at the hinge (the case falls apart if you try to open it), and the plastic spindel area on the interior of the jewel case that &#34;grabs&#34; the center of the CD to hold it in place was comp[letely broken so the CD flys out of the case as soon as you hint about opening the case.  The CD itself arrived with no scratches and I can replace the case if I need to.
B00422LESO|5.0|love it love it love it!  can't wait for the movie.  i have recommended it to all my fellow austen friends!
B008ASGP3U|5.0|i have been reading Ian Rankins  books for sometime now and have never been disappointed. His writing is superb and exciting
B00AYDC5HY|3.0|I think this movie was too dark both literally and figuratively. My grandsons lost interest in the movie several times and I have to say I did too.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Rodriguez is a very intriguing individual. In this documentary he is very well presented. The mother of his daughters was never mentioned and left us curious.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|I got turned on by the TV series, and couldn't wait for season 3 so I picked this book up. I haven't read fiction in years, and this was definitely the book to break that cycle. It's like reading ten stories at once- it's a fascinating read, and difficult to put down despite the 900 or so pages.
030759565X|5.0|The photos are gorgeous, the recipes delicious and the instructions clear and helpful. I have never gone wrong with a recipe from Deb Perelman, be it for 5 pounds of brisket made for a first time for holiday guests, or the absolutely amazing tomato shortcakes featured on the cover made for a quick lunch.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|david baldacci keeps the pages turning.  entire book has to be read in one sitting because its so compelling.  never go wrong with fast moving story action of baldacci characters.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This game's title describes itself. It is an epic, not EPIC! It has many plot points simple enough to be called an app and not a full-fledged game. If this was a full PC/Mac/Linux game it would be boring after a time. It is nice to play whilst on a plane or travelling. I do not suggest driving and playing these games.
B00BESJYAY|4.0|I watched this movie with my older grandsons 13 and 10 years old.  We all enjoyed the movie and I was able to sneak in a few life lessons for the boys while we watched. I thought the actors and actresses were fantastic and the plot was exciting and never boring.
B006T3RM08|5.0|I had read the reviews about the track pad not fitting right and it not letting the track pad click, this is not an issue with the one that I received.  I guess they have sorted out the problem and it works perfectly!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow, what a read.  Can't wait to start the next book.  A story of humanity at it's worst and the impact of reality TV. Although this is fantasy, it does not even seem that far-fetched at this point in time. Hope it is not a guide to the future.
B002PZC8BM|4.0|The Mentalist is the perfect mix of mystery and humor without too much gore. Too much gore ruins a good story!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the new obsticles and its graphics are much better! And the best part is you can use it in the car because it doesn't need Wi-Fi
B000Y0Q5NM|3.0|The actors have yet to find their groove. Many see the McGuyver still lingering around. His habits show through in some of his mannerisms. All-in-all this is the young portion of this season. It's like a flower getting ready to bloom. This show had many, many seasons for a reason, so don't just bow out now, stick through the whole series.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|All of the travel to this room and that room becomes a little annoying and I wish there were more puzzles of finding objects.  But I do like that it has you perform different puzzles.  I recommend it depending on what kind of game you enjoy playing.  If you like finding objects with little of anything else, then I wouldn't get the game.  If you like a mix of different puzzles then it's great for you.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|The performances from Hawkes and Hunt are amazing.  It's easy not to appreciate that since it's a very low key movie.  It's an interesting story.  Worth the watch.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|By far the best game in the app world, great graphics, nice interactions, just great over all! BUT I don't know if its just my Kindle fire.. but it freezes and I cant even load it. There's just a black screen. When this happens I just Redownload it! Its that great. Don't let me turn you from buying it, you WONT regret it! Happy playing.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I work over night and often have trouble sleeping once I get home and the sun is up. With White Noise I have virtually eliminated that problem. The different ways you have to use this app are really unique. You can combine different sounds and layer them to create new sounds and environments. Using the sounds as alarms is pretty cool too. The best part is that once you purchase the app you can get tons of new sounds  created by the designer and the users of the app, and it is free. You also have the ability to create your own sounds that work for you. One price and endless updates. This is by far my favorite practical app on my phone.
0316228532|2.0|When Barry Fairbrother dies suddenly, the small town of Pagford is in shock. His death leaves an open position on the town's council. As different people vie for the position, long held secrets are brought to light and the peaceful town of Pagford isn't nearly as peaceful as it seems.<br /><br />I am fully aware that this is not Harry Potter. I understand that this book is targeted at adults. If Rowling's intention was to write something completely different than Harry Potter, then she accomplished that goal. Knowing to expect something totally different than Harry Potter, I was still shocked at the extreme direction this book took. I've read books by other authors who have written a popular children's/young adult series and then wrote an adult book. In those books, I was still able to get a feel for the author's voice. Not so with Casual Vacancy. It really felt like it was someone completely different writing the book. Language was terrible. I've read adult books with language in them in the past, and I typically ignore it. In this case, it was almost every other sentence (and in some cases words) that was a curse word. I felt like I needed a list of characters to keep them all straight. There wasn't one particular character that I was attached to. Authority is completely disrespected. There is abundant drug use, sex, hints of abuse and neglect, suicidal tendencies in addition to the coarse language. There were some chapters that after reading, I wanted to go take a shower because I felt dirty. Will I still read books that Rowling writes? Most likely as I love Harry Potter.<br /><br />My personal opinion is that Rowling needs to continue to write children's/young adult books and not to attempt a book that doesn't even sound like she wrote it!<br /><br />I rented this book from the library. It's only costing me the twenty cents that is the late fee for not returning it on time. I attempted to read this book for pure pleasure, but instead struggled through it.<br /><br />My thoughts and opinions are my own. Disclaimer - I did not set out to write a scathing review, though I realize that it may sound like one.<br /><br />Recommended to - I really cannot recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />Rating - 1.5 stars, which will be a 2 star rating on Amazon as my criteria for a 1 star book is that it puts me to sleep.br />My thoughts and opinions are my own.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|My friends went on the ole &#34;Logitech is Best&#34; rant. I tend to be one to go against the grain. They all purchased their Verizon phones and I went against the grain, saved up, bought a GNex 4. Now I'm on top of the world! Back to the mouse, this mouse is fantastic. You can customize the Anker Logo LED light. Also, it has true 8000dpi. The adjustable profiles are nice as well. I suggest you get a decent mouse pad for this. My white piece of paper mouse pad does not do this mouse justice.
B00065MDRW|5.0|Strangely enough what attracted me first was the artwork, a wonderfully trippy, but strange image of a screaming man. I didn't even know the band's name or what kind of music they played. So it was a wonderful surprise to find the band's rolling brand of jazzy, progressive psychedelic rock. It's at times soothing, at times chaotic, and at times (actually most of the time) simply epic. What's better is the band's interesting creative jams that don't meander into baseless or prolonged jams. There's no exhausting 20 minute tracks or small useless filler tracks, just 5 great songs. No more, no less. I would strongly suggest this to any fan of psychedelic or progressive rock, or even anything simply trippy.
B005JZ18IY|5.0|Absolutely fabulous CD. Extra songs/tracks included. Ed's style(s) of folk, alternative, R&B, pop, all kinds of different songs and beats ( slow and fast songs) is soooo eclectic and really amazing.<br />His songs are enough to make you cry, from the lyrics alone. Combine the home-grown beautiful lyrics with his beautiful guitar playing and voice and you will be enthralled. Well, I am. LOL.  Haven't as of today heard any other CD's by him yet, but I sampled this one before I bought it and knew it was going to be really nice. Very  impressive. There are  few pop-ish songs that are upbeat and well done, and of course several guitar songs with just him and the guitar where his words are crystal clear and very simple with really good melodies... Pretty much all love songs in some way or another, but each different. Good job on variety for sure.<br />He really has been influenced by so many different genres, and it shows. Amazing, especially for his age. Cant wait to hear more. You won't regret it. This was the only CD that had all of the songs I was looking for, including the bonus tracks. I found that, no matter what the seller(S) advertised,  if the CD cover didn't SAY \\"bonus tracks included\\" on it,  you will not get the full CD to include bonus songs.(6?) Some sellers were deceiving, FYI. If you don't care about getting the extra songs, go for the regular, easier to find CD titled \\"plus\\". It is the same fabulous CD, minus a few bonus tracks, obviously. Just a tid-bit.  :)
B00B2G2RG6|3.0|We started watching this show but just couldn't continue with the series.  It's very dark and depressing.  Nothing good happens, only bad.  They try to stop the killings but it just continues.  Kevin Bacon is good in his role and the characters are well developed.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|I do not see what is so great about this movie, to me, it was really predictable and you can tell it didn't happen that way, too scripted.<br /><br />\\"The Next Three Days\\" and \\"End of Shift\\" were better movies, more intense and less predictable.<br /><br />Movie probably funded by who knows
B007GE2H3G|5.0|Great movie! Looks really real! Highly recommend to everyone! Tintin had a quite big adventure there! I love snowy and the caption!
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|Just downloaded this for a lark.  It is ok but I don't play it very often.  I like the games more.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really enjoy this casual game. It looks much better than the original - which is/was a great game also - and will not fail to give you some good time killing fun. Get it and don't forget to duck.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|It's great, the movies and everything work but for some unknown reason which could completely be my BD player ( which I'm unsure of) there's no menu or anything.  It's weird. otherwise it's a very simple packaging but the movies are great and they works.
B008RTE08E|5.0|Great video, purchased for my 14 year old stepson who is totally into the Beatles!  He loved it and it was cool to have his dad  watch with him!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I would recommend this book to those who want to know the background of the mission and all the training and skills that a Seal goes through. I was amazed at how thorough they train for all kinds of missions. After reading this I respect the dedication of these men even more. They are truly &#34;super men&#34;!<br /><br />Five stars would have been given had I been able to read without looking up the definitions of all the military terms used. I expected to have terms I wouldn't know but the author seemed to be writing more for comrades and others who are familiar to military than the everyday person.
B003O85W3A|5.0|I purchased this as a gift and it was very well received.  I can still by music for my adult grandsons, believe it or not!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Most riviting novel I have read in  while.The technical aspect did not take away from the excitement generated by the plot.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I think this game is fun for when I am waiting in lines or for my children to keep them entertained while riding in the car, etc. It looks good, is fun, and worth the price.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Great overall movie. I would def recommend. If u like movies based on true stories this is a movie for you.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|It keeps you wanting more. I want to always watch the show and cannot wait till the next episode. Love it.
0891349553|4.0|Very easy to understand directions. Great pictures. I was looking for a book to make miniatures for my dollhouses and this book shows how to do several sizes.
B0024SQW2Q|4.0|It is very nice to be able to sit in my own home and watch movies of my choosing. Thanks for great service!
B001NHNG64|4.0|Troubles found the hitchhiker Jack once more. This time, he and a tough fair maiden were kidnapped and driven into a militia settlement, with a fanatic leader set to declare independence and commit mass murder. Too bad for them, Jack got in their way.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Very illuminating to read from the perspective of someone with a mental illness. Although funny at times, it was mostly sad to read about someone whose delusions became their &#34;truth&#34;.
1435136403|5.0|A collection of timeless classic detective stories for all ages and all generations to be read over and over again.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I love everything about this show! The cast, the story line, relationships. The behind the scenes clips and commentary are extremely entertaining!
1423101502|5.0|great series!!!! learning in an adventurous way - a great way to learn about the greek gods and goddess by recreating the old stories with a modern twist
B00BNNJHXO|5.0|So, after melting my ears for the last 4 hours straight, i've come to the conclusion that there are absolutely zero weak spots in this entire album.  20 songs of technical Swedish brilliance.  If you're a genuine fan of Soilwork, you won't be disappointed.  Some of the best material they've put out to date.  One of the few albums out there where I &#34;like it ALL&#34;.  Especially considering it's 20 songs worth.<br /><br />Put up the cash and get yourself an amazing album!
6305511055|4.0|The movie itself was great, however the disc did not work properly. It has since been returned for a refund and I've ordered a replacement.
B002KVZBGA|3.0|On some level, I really enjoyed this movie.  It had very funny car chases, and I think it would be great to watch with older children. It was nice to see a young Michael Caine without having him get involved in a romance. A young Michael Caine is nice to look at!<br /><br />I'd rate it GP, actually. The caper was almost clever (although I really didn't understand the planning.)<br /><br />Don't expect any deep philosophical insights here!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Two Graves, was totally enthralling. The twists and turns that were taken along the way had me turning pages(figuratively) until the wee hours of the morning.  For those true fans out there, this is definitely a must read in the Pendergast series.  It is dark, twisted and unexpected!  My only regret is that I now have to wait for the next book to be published.<br /><br />Reading this book on the kindle was a completely authentic and enjoyable experience for me.  I would highly recommend this last Pendergast novel to  other &#34;Agent Pendergast&#34; fans.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|All the characters were well played.  The story line hung together throughout the movie.  I especially liked the synopsis that followed the movie.  It was a feel good movie and it made me wish some of today's current events would turn out as well.
0545265355|5.0|the hunger games is a wonderful series - a bit brutal sometimes, but worth the read!!! katniss is an amazing character
B003DZX3SA|5.0|My VCR, TV, and my tape of this all broke at the same time, which sucked because it my favorite movie of all time.  although its a bit pricey, it's totally worth every penny! There are three versions: Theatrical, extended, and work in progress. the extended one has an extra scene that I wish was in the normal one!! There are 2 mini games that would be lots of fun for little kids on the second disc. Also on the second disc, there is an alternate beginning. It was interesting to see how differently things could've been.
B009D3CTVS|3.0|Small compact and works well. Recommended for apple users. I really have nothing more to say about this pro duct.
B009FZFONO|5.0|You are drawn in from the first minute. It's addicting. I love it. You will be surprised and hooked! Only bad thing is now that we are caught up to season 3 we have to wait a whole week to watch each episode.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Fringe was my favorite show, I have watched since day one and needless to say I was disappointed to see it end.<br /> I just started season 1(on prime) and it's awesome to see how the plot comes together. There were so many episodes and great moments, I am having a great time watching it again.<br />With Prime it's awesome, If you liked the show I recommend watching it again.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love watching Downton Abbey.  I am on season 3 and do not want it to end!  I highly recommend it!
1423101499|5.0|the percy jackson series is a great way to learn or review you knowledge of greek mythology - old stories with a modern twist
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I truly enjoy this app. It allows you the user to decide what \\"mix\\" of sounds works for you to assist you in either relaxing, focusing or sleeping. I actually have a couple mixes in my favorites that perk me right up - make me smile & stay focused on the task at hand.<br /><br />An excellent feature is your ability to set the soumd mix you want and have it play in the background while reading on your Kindle. The timer is another fine feature.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|We first found these three years ago when our first was a baby. They are so cute, but are really great because it is harder to lose than just a soothie. They can not roll out of the crib in the middke of the night and a child can easily find it in their crib and put it back in their mouth when they want it. My daughter is two and still has hers, but she got a hold in the soothie part and was very upset. It wpuld be nice to be able to change those out. We just sewed a new one on. It doesn't look that great but she loves it!
B00AA0TZTW|3.0|This CD would be perfect for someone that REALLY liked Hendrix but hadn't yet acquired many of the bootleg versions of (most of) these tracks.  Someone who sorta likes Hendrix will find this cd a tough listen as there is not as much pop music or singles oriented stuff you'll get on his earlier albums.  As someone who has already heard rough mixes of the source material this CD was culled, cut and pasted together from it's distracting to hear how fabricated these tunes are.  BUT at the end of the day some tracks are less cobbled together than others and almost any of the tracks has some fantastic guitar by Jimi.  \\"Bleeding Heart\\" is awesome and new even to collectors.
1439190275|5.0|I just simply love it! It is just as it was described and the sipping was fast. Great diet btw. I think everyone should try it :)
B004AW64CM|5.0|my computer is around 9 years old and my parents handed it down to me when thy bought a new one.  i even remember being a teen when i used it living with my parents.<br /><br />the fact that this classic movie played on this old computer is wonderful.<br /><br />i guess it's time to get a new computer but I'm just so used to this one and don't want to let go of it.<br /><br />i just loved the movie and it was very heartwarming.
0345803485|3.0|because everyone else is reading it, i had to too. i find that this book (series) runs parallel with the twighlight series - albiet in a more adult way, but there were to many similarities for me to real fall in love with this one.  an insignificant female, a male with too much money that has a secret and who is adopted.  the unrealistic chance of them liking each other and falling in love.  i dont know, its entertaining, like most first time in love books, but i just couldnt really fall in love with it.
B003CFBQBW|5.0|I was excited to see that I could finally get this soundtrack for $10.00! It came in perfect condition & I love the bonus poster that comes with the Twilight Soundtracks. The music as a whole are so beautiful! Especially Sia's &#34;My Love&#34; and Metric's &#34; Eclipse (All Yours). &#34;Chop and Change&#34; from The Black Keys as wells as Florence + The Machine's &#34;Heavy In Your Arms&#34; were eargams. I am very satisfied and I will buy the New Moon soundtrack from this merchant as well. ( New Moon is the last one I do not own.)
B00846REIS|5.0|this story grabs your attention and doesn't disappoint. i am so glad there is a sequel. love these characters. fabulouse!
B00926J3K6|5.0|The massive Lark's Tongues in Aspic box set is one of the greatest and most expansive ever. I would have to guess that it is the single largest box sets ever devoted to basically one album.<br />Although you (believe it or not) will need other releases to complete this listening period in the history of King Crimson , this will get you well on your way.<br />What you have here is a chronological presentation of several concerts that pre-dated the release of the studio version of this release. King Crimson would hone songs in concert prior to recording them in the studio , thus perfecting the songs prior to actually releasing them.<br />One would logically think that hearing so many versions of the same song would be tiresome , but this is simply not the case. Each song shows natural growth and development throughout each performance culminating in the studio release. After hearing many , many versions of David Cross on violin , sadly the studio version contained only portions of him with the band , as he had departed. However , Robert Fripp plays many of his parts on guitar , which presents an entirely different listening experience .<br />Although many of these recordings are of bootleg quality , non are all that bad. Even the &#34;secret download&#34; included in the box (Check the back of the ticket stub) is great to hear.<br />The remastered , remixed version by Porcupine Tree genius Steve Wilson is simply breathtaking.<br />A close second in my opinion for the best Crimson album (with the debut being first) , this IS the treatment to get of this monumental recording.<br />Don't be put off by the price tag , it is worth every $$$.
B0013ND30M|5.0|Love sharing the movies with our kids that my wife and I grew up with. Too bad not all titles are available at all times.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I have read every book that has been published by Morgan Rice.  Are her books perfect?  No.  If there is an author that is perfect I would love to know who they are.  Morgan writes books that are entertaining. What more could we readers want?  When I read one of her stories I feel I become part of that story.  Her writing skills can take us away from our daily struggles.  I for one could not ask for more.  &#34;Stay the course&#34; Morgan.  If your books can make just one persons life a little more bearable, well, you have done more than most of us!!!
0307595579|5.0|great series - completely differnt from what i am use to reading - it took me a bit to get started for that same reason, but once i was in i couldnt put them down
B000ZN802W|5.0|A great reminder to everyone to not get caught up in materialism and enjoy the world around us while not forgetting those we love.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|i love this story. it has me sucked in . couldn't put it down. i have read it 3 times.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book . Couldn't put it down. Very intense. All three books are unforgettable. Don't know if I can read another book. These books have made my standards of books very high.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I choose this rating, not because it isn't good, it is very good.  It's me, I have a hard time doing it.  I am 71 and my brain doesn't always work the way it should.  Getting slow at times.
1400067820|5.0|Taleb's thesis is<br /><br />&#34;Everything gains or loses from volatility. Fragility is what loses from volatility<br />and uncertainty. &#34;<br /><br />Voltatility is also taken to mean randomness/uncertainty in certain cases.<br /><br />He maps a spectrum:<br /><br />Fragile to Robust to AntiFragile.<br /><br />Fragile things break with volatility and stressors.<br />Robust things don't lose or gain. (But over a long time their robustness may erode).<br />Antifragile things gain with volatility.<br /><br />Fragile things are concave. Concave meaning limited upside massive downside. Think paying for parking verses recieving a ticket.<br />Antifragile things are convex. Convex meaning limited downside massive upside. Think lottery ticket.<br /><br />Given the condition of his theory, he argues that our society is becoming more fragile. And the main reason is due to accountability (i'm oversimplifying theres a lot more in between). For example, he says that writers, media pundits, academics, bankers and wall st types get the upside while the society gets the downside. An example is the financial crisis. The ceo's get the upside even if they get fired, they get millions and society has to bail them out. Another example is media pundits, who can be absolutely wrong, but still be on the air because its easy for people to forget. But there information may misinform people. The media analyst gets the upside of being controversial. The public gets the downside of bad knowledge.<br /><br />He also suggests that our ancestors knew the dire conseuqnces of the agent/principal problem. So how did they deal with it? Hannurabi, eye for and eye. If you make a bridge you have to live under it. People nowadays can blow things up and not have to deal with the consequences. They can spew lies and misinform people and get away with it and become famous. We need better controls to make people have more accountability. He suggests we take a look into the pass and apply some of those principles, people have to have skin in the game. If the senate will initiate a war, their children should have to serve as well.<br /><br />His framework addresses the critical issue. Some people are recieving the optionaility of tremendous upside, while society is recieving the downside. If our society does not address this critical flaw in our system. We are likely to blow up.<br /><br />He maybe abbrasive at times but his unabashed approach is important for what he's trying to accomplish. &#34;If you see fraud and do not say fraud, you are a fraud.&#34; He see's trying to galvinize others because the system is extremely vulnerable to corruption and instability.<br /><br />But I think the theme he is pushing is definitely appropriate and it goes straight to the root of many problems today.
1423113381|5.0|osiris, isis, set and many other egyption gods and goddess are awaiting you in the kane chronicle adventures.  like the percy jackson series takes you back to roman times, so does this series, but in stead of rome you travel to the time of the egypt.
0810993139|4.0|Once again this is a popular book that my daughter showed interest in so I decided to purchase it for her enjoyment.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|What can I say? You know why you love Google. This just makes it all the more convenient to search for what you want!
0307744434|4.0|The Night Circus was a great read with compelling characters that plays off the old stereotype of every kid wants to run away to join the circus. It has a great climactic build up for the ending, but the ending fell a tad flat for me. It wasn't bad, just not on par for what it was built up to be. The real complaint for the book is it skips around a lot from dates and times and characters, and it also changes from first person to third person and back and forth a lot. It makes the book seem a bit like if it were a person it would have muliple personality disorder. However it is a fun easy read, and it is worth the time it takes to read it.
0689835604|5.0|I bought this for my granddaughter and she already has it, so it stays at my house.  It is her favorite book.  She can re-read this one over and over.  She is 18 months old.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book and I couldn't put it down, once I started reading. I thought that this book was just as good as the movie they made.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|We watched it religiously when it was on regular TV.  We forgot how great it was! One of the first prime time shows that was this raw and 'In your face.'  Not for the faint of heart.  We like being able to watch episodes back to back.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I got this app so my daughter can play it and she really seems to like it so im satisfied with it.
0307887960|5.0|Great feeling - knowing that I am really do it this time.  I am inspired to share my feeling and continue my journey!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun game but keeps putting ads. otherwise. is fantastic you can talk to your friends if they play. this game :)
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Great page-turner again from Mr Baldacci.  Good twists and turns throughout.  I really like the fact that just when you think the plot is set...it is different!
B00BESLHEA|5.0|you have to know the back story of the rza  and the Wii tang clan to truly appreciate this movie
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great book with amazing characters, and a story line that kept me reading until I finished!! Can't wait until the next book!!
B000WTXD30|4.0|This is exactly what I expected it to be.  i enjoyed the purchase and the wife says she enjoyed it as well.  Download it....you won't be sorry.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|a little trouble loading sometimes,  but very fun.  gave my horse a top hat and it gi es me constant giggles.  I grew up riding horses and this game almost makes me feel like I'm back on horseback.  this game is so worth it.
B00846F1YW|5.0|I really liked this game.  It was a lot of fun.  I got this game as a free app of the day.  I would have gladly paid if I had not. There are so many levels with different challenges to make it more interesting. You can also add additional players.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I bought this book on my Kindle because of all the hype over the movie and some positive reviews I had read.  But when I got into the book, I found the plot simple and the characters not really developed all that well.  I can see how this book would appeal to a young pre-teen girl, but not for mature readers.  I thought it was just a waste of time and money.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was able to catch up with this series by watching Season 1 and 2.  Can't wait for Season 4.
B009J2VQSK|5.0|I loved this music when I heard it in the theater and was very happy to order and enjoy<br />it
B009JZVT70|5.0|They nailed this series w the storyline and cast. It never gets boring. You just want to know what happens next week.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|It was good but I actually expected better.  Good suspense and action and factually accurate. I would recommend to a friend
1451629192|5.0|This was probably the most moving book I have ever read. It was written by a 29 year old but in a way it was as if she was still 11 yrs old. Simple and to the point. No flowery passages just straight from the heart. It explains how she was brainwashed into believing she was a &#34;help&#34; to that creature. She raised her children and taught them altho she only went to grade school. That young lady is an inspiration to anyone who is in a bad situation and she became a winner in life. She has problems but her daughters are her life now. I am so happy and proud this young lady beat all odds. Actually no words can explain this book. It is so inspiring. It is a chronology leading up to her abduction to being released. At he end of the book is a section about questions to be discussed. The book is 279 pages. It is worth reading and following such a beautiful girl during the years of her abduction.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Thank you Richard for letting me know that I'm not crazy and not alone in  my thoughts on religion and the world that it has created!
B005AVIZ6U|4.0|The usual Jack Reacher. A very good read. Lee child's is my best author and. I look forward to reading more of his books.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I'm tired of running or puzzling against the clock. Quell Reflect is such a nice contrast to traditional puzzle games. I'm definitely in the mood for this game which is also beautiful to look at in a different way. Very enjoyable.
B006Z00R1Q|4.0|It kept me on my toes, I was surprised of the ending, I can se it building up to the next movie!
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This includes both b/w and color versions and the color version is a hundred times improved over the old tinted colorized. It's excellent! Totally realistic looking.
B008C20TDG|5.0|A simple and easy read, well articulated, many examples, analogies, and short example stories (Of which one of them nailed me perfectly). Having began a Crossfit challenge myself, following a Paleo way of living is essential (There's a Zone portion to this challenge also), and pretty easy once you get the hang of it. This book opened my eyes, removed the covers that have always caused me to repeat food mistakes and not knowing why. I truly understand what the real meaning of &#34;A Balanced Meal&#34; means now, and my body loves it. Since turning to Paleo, I have dropped my blood pressure meds, Diabetes Type2 meds, and Acid Reflux Meds, in less than 6 months. This book has further opened my eyes also to what taking responsibility is really about on a personal level. I choose to eat properly, exercise regularly, and I loose the dependance of drugs due to health issues. It's that simple.  Hope this book helps someone else as much as it has me.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|An excellent show. Although I hear you can get it free on other websites. THE last episode of the season was not enough to turn me off the show altogether... but it was a terrible ending.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I have seen the Broadway production and the movie twice.  The music is rich and moving and brings the scenes back to mind in a powerful way.
B008QPCCQQ|4.0|I was delighted to find The Rose Blooms, which is the sequel to Eight Cousins, my favorite book.  I look forward to reading more hidden gems.  Yes the editing is bad, missing many commas and leaving some phrases indecipherable.  But it wasn't bad enough to ruin the story.  I plan on buying paper copies of my favorite books in this edition, and am very glad it became available.  I am a 29 year old female with four children, and we spend plenty of time in read alouds.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|These books are so much fun. You see the silly mistakes she makes but things seem to work out for her ( sometimes not as well as she hoped).
B007IK44CK|5.0|I watched it on Amazon Video and it was in good quality and no streaming issues while viewing the online movie.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|You'll think about this one the next time you fly. A very different role for Washington. A different kind of hero? Didn't like the ending, but couldn't think of a better way to end it.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Bought this after listening to the author being interviewed. He appealed instantly and this is reflected in his writing. Such fun reading the story of flawed characters who are credible and easily recognisable. Can't wait for his second book.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|What feels like infinite puzzles, no need for another Sudoku download ever again.  There's also positive variations of the game that are new to me as well.
B00597A6NU|5.0|A fictional story of the Memphis Belle. The characters are funny and interesting. John Litgow's character is so lame and stupid it drags the story down.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|The author is excellent at thorough research and even better at placing the historical record in a very informative and interesting book.
B00821OX98|5.0|Love this series. I was so happy when I saw that Amazon had it for prime Members. Can't wait for the 3 one.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|There was lot of buzz about this movie. I liked it, but I'm not sure about Best Picture Award. Very loosely based on a true story.
B002361MLA|4.0|Clearly articulates &#34;NOW&#34; the moment and how nothing else really has relevance. Well written and insightful. This author has mee hooked. Off to buy &#34;A New Earth&#34;.
B0012FHGCW|5.0|I really felt this was a close description of what happened due to the input of the family members. They were open to tell about even their darkest times to help reveal how and why their son (and brother) became how he was. The book was terrific and the movie did it justice. I'd recommend this movie to young and old alike.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|I wasn't that excited to watch this movie but wow it was one of the best I have seen in a while. Totally worth it
B00AA36RZY|5.0|Great book, easy to read. I'm sure I'll  keep the concepts in my mind for a long time. The examples are very interesting and I will be able to explain design patterns to other people using a better approach.
1426209584|5.0|It is hard to believe these are real birds that exist in nature.  The photographs are beautiful and the descriptions of  the birds fascinating. Now we can't wait to see the video.  Not only have we spent many hours enjoying this incredible book, we have amazed our friends with the pictures and information. If you are a nature lover I highly recommend this book.
B00ARAO720|4.0|This is a movie that I had never heard of in the theaters. I enjoyed it, but I felt the acting by Michael Shannon was almost comical in a serious movie. Didn't understand that.
B00AZMFO6I|3.0|If you're going to make a movie about opera singers, the first rule is to cast someone who is at least plausible in the role.  Maggie Smith is one of my favorite actresses, and I'd go see a door open if she was in it, but, despite all her formidable talents, nothing about her suggests that she's got the ability to loft an aria.  She doesn't open her mouth wide enough to to get much more than an acidic remark through, and with a voice somewhere between sand paper and a cat's purr.  Meryl Streep would have been a much better choice.  Fortunately, Dustin Hoffman spares us the embarrassment of having to listen to her try, but with what amounts to a swindle;  we know that we've just been robbed, but of something we were so nervous about being caught with that it's something of a relief.  Still...<br /><br />This should not be interpreted as a slur against the talent in this movie.  The Quartet of actors at the center, while not from the Opera, are a diverse bunch of experienced actors that are a pleasure to watch, and the cast in the background is largely composed of former opera divas, cast members, and symphony orchestra members.  Something like \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" although as noted, Maggie Smith is not to Opera, what Gloria Swanson was to the Silent Screen.<br /><br />And, it's something of a relief that the trailer doesn't give everything away.  It turns out that, even with the \\"F\\"bomb, it's Maggie Smith's character who's to blame, not the gentleman.  It seems that Tom Courtenay and Smith's characters were very briefly married until someone went astray and an attempt at honesty misfired and, well time passes very quickly...  In any case, the love story is one of two plots that intertwine within the main story, that being the need to have a concert to raise funds such that the grand old English country home can be preserved as a home for aged Musicians.  The old hams have to sing for their bread.  Why not, the Girl Scouts have to do it.  Thus, when Smith lands at the coop, the Quartet is once again together, so logically it would seem they should be the top bill of the night.  Maggie Smith's  Jean, disagrees, and that's the movie, well, getting past that...<br /><br />About that \\"F\\" Bomb.  Apparently Ms. Smith swears like a sailor off stage, and while I have no problem with that, I wouldn't have minded if she played a character more like herself, off stage (whatever that may be), where such language might be more integral to the story.  Having a woman of such dignity suddenly spout vulgarisms is a bit tacky.  What next?  Nudity?  Diane Keaton did it.  Must we see them all naked?<br /><br />Maggie Smith is big these days.  Movies about and for an older audience are big money makers.  It's a bit much to expect everything she's in to be like \\"A Room With A View\\" or \\"Downton Abbey\\".  I don't think this will be listed among her best movies.  If you wait until it's available to be streamed, then you'll save a quite a bit of money and may well find this movie to be more to your liking.  I went out to the theater, which I rarely do these days, sat through the commercials and spent over $30. for two people with a popcorn and diet coke, and it's not worth nearly that much effort and money.  Not by a long shot.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|Love this movie!  Have already watched it several times.  Love Hugh Grant in any movie he is in!  Very good ending too!
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Works great on my tab 10.1 with WinXP, Win7 & Win8!<br /><br />Running Android Ice Cream Sandwich. Gestures work good on Windows 8 as well. Took a little bit to learn the splashtop gestures.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This isn't worth the space, Temple Run is way better. This is just Temple Run with characters. Try Temple Run or Bear Run 3D.
B000ZN8036|5.0|this movie makes an awsome gift for nature inthusiests that love a great and true story that they can relate to
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|Great acting, as you would probably expect. If you like something very strange you'll love this one. I kept waiting for something to happen that never did. Phoenix and Hoffman are excellent in their roles. Phoenix plays a very weird fellow that has lots of physiological disorders. His portrayal is worth a watch. The movie is a little long.
B0060AY6FO|5.0|Good nightime read, but not a &#34;must read.&#34;  Character development above average, but plot rather predictable.<br />Prefer author's mystery series.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|A powerful, moving recognition of the life of Adam Brown. An imperfect man who endeavored to be the best son, husband, father and soldier. For me his life was a example of the miraculous.
B004EPYZZI|5.0|I saw this movie in the movie theaters and loved it!! I also like that this movie is based on Bethany's life and how against all odds she over came. It is the best inspirational family movie I have seen in a while and would recommend to anyone who is looking for good hearted family movie with christian values.
B00821OX98|5.0|Interesting plot and characters, and more gun porn than you can shake a stick at. They also do an amazing job of showing a post-apocalyptic America that you can believe could really happen.
B006VJMZXY|3.0|I felt that I'd read the story before in the other books covering the 'Royal Witches'. It had some aspects of historical interest but not enough to keep me enthralled.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Within the first few pages of this book, I was sucked in. I have to force myself to take a break so that I can get some other things done. I'm really enjoying it!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|It is difficult to believe this sort of thing exists, but it does. The author gives us a chilling journey through the gulags of North Korea. This is what Dennis Rodman didn't see.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Very interesting<br />Recommend to anyone who likes this type of game!<br />Started playing this and did not want to stop!
B006Z20976|5.0|I saw this movie in the movie theaters and loved it!! I also liked that this movie is based on father's who want to do right for their families and place God and his word as the foundation to build on. It is one of the best inspirational family movie I have seen in a while and would recommend to anyone who is looking for good hearted family movie with christian values.
B006LSZECO|4.0|As the mystery of the disappearing wife unfolded, I enjoyed the subtle craftsmanship and layerings of both the husband's and the wife's chronological accounts... the creeping realization that neither of them is exactly the kind of person you'd want to have close to you. As clues and red herrings arise, the novel rushes to its gripping conclusion... an unsatisfying Mexican standoff.  I'll read it again - but will close the book before the actual ending, and make up one of my own!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I admit, I didn't start reading this book until after Chris Kyle's death, but I had wanted to read it for awhile. It's definitely an honest look at the war in Iraq, not some eloquently written lie of what really goes on. I really enjoyed it though & highly recommend it for every American to read.  His untimely death is a true tragedy for his family & his friends that didn't get enough time with him after his service to the country ended. Although, Chris' service to this country was ongoing, stateside, as he continued to help wounded vets up until the day he died. He will be truly missed!
B00881VLCE|2.0|totally loved this app until I purchased two new puzzle packs and they did not download but my credit card was charged! please either give me my puzzles or a refund and I will be glad to give this app a 5 star rating and a raving review!!!!
B00B1OWEVC|4.0|Welcome oblivion sounds like a meticulously planned and programmed error, unlike anything I've heard before.<br />And I'd expect nothing less from Trent Reznor.<br />As far as lyrically...well, I really didn't know what to expect from his wife and the lyricist for the band, Mariqueen Maandig, not really. There was that EP they put out back in the summer of 2010, but, according to them, they've evolved and grown since then and that was just them finding their voices as they learned to work together, just &#34;an artifact from that moment in time&#34;.<br />Musically, they have done everything they said they would: grown as a band, found their unique voice, discovered how best to work together...musically.<br />Lyrically?<br />Uh...<br />Man, is the music on here great...<br /><br />The wake-up - Excellent introduction. Really conveys the feel of the album as a whole and gets the listener excited for what they're about to experience. The perfect sonic mission statement for HTDA. This is How to destroy angels_.<br /><br />Keep it together - In the context of the whole album this is a very solid place to start; slow, dark and melodic, not too much of the dissonant electronic fracas found elsewhere to scare off people new to the band. Well placed and well played.<br /><br />And the sky began to scream - The sounds and sound manipulation on here are just excellent. That frayed, thudding bass and razor sharp electronic cat scratch set against those frail, shuddering strings and flutes is perfect. Even if the lyrics aren't. I enjoy the build up at the end, but there's no real pay off.<br /><br />Welcome oblivion - It's so great to hear Mariqueen screaming on this. I love to hear her doing something different from what we've heard thus far. The beat reminds me of Depeche Mode's Home and lyrics are steeped in apocalyptic consequences. I have problems with neither fact.<br /><br />Ice age - Sonically, this is the most diverse track on the album; the clear, almost bluegrass plinks and plunks cut through the electronic haze that floods in towards the end. Again...the lyrics...not so much. Also, because this was released several months ago on their An Omen EP, I've become a bit overexposed to it. I need to come back around to enjoying it, but that's my issue, not that of the song.<br /><br />On the wing - Also released in November 2012, I still think this is one of the stronger tracks on here, like &#34;Ice Age&#34; it sounds different from most of its surroundings. Reznor and Maandig's voices go together very nicely.<br /><br />Too late, all gone - The vocal treatment on this is something I've never heard before. There are so many textures...it seems I hear something different every time I listen to it. Even if &#34;the more we change, everything stays the same&#34; isn't the most original or inspired sentiment/lyric, this is one of those rare moments when I'm actually hearing something new.<br /><br />How long? - When this first came out a month or so before the album, it sounded overly 80's to me. In a bad way. Plus, those awful lyrics... As I've stuck with it though, it's grown on me and I've found some of the deeper, more subtle layers. It won't ever be my favorite, but I no longer skip it when it comes on either.<br /><br />Strings and attractors - Despite a rough beginning (that high, fuzzy, metallic ping-PING get real annoying, real quick) and some cookie cutter lyrics (again), I like the harmony and sound of the chorus, specifically the softness of Reznor's voice. Once things open up at the end, I really start to like this a lot, even if it does sound like the melody from &#34;And All That Could Have Been&#34;.<br /><br />We fade away - It's so obvious from the start for anyone who knows SONOIO that Cortini is on this. The vocals (though not the lyrics...&#34;let's record a song for which all the lyrics sound, phonetically, like &#34;we fade away!&#34;) and build and piano are great. There's some guitar that sounds just like that used on the Dragon Tattoo score and it's more than welcome here. Cortini's muffled screaming is a wonderful surprise. But, although things get a little more lively, the payoff isn't enough; rather than something exploding out of the water, we get some pretty big ripples, but nothing else. This happens twice in the course of this track.<br /><br />Recursive self-improvement- This sounds like a b-side from the score for The Social Network. Plus, the &#34;you intentionally can't hear the vocals&#34; approach to recording/mixing vocals always bugs me. Are you trying to cover up silly or unimportant lyrics? Is this just meant to be sonic texturing? I've tried getting into this, finding things tucked and layered in here, and there are a few slightly interesting moments, but not enough. This takes up six and a half minutes that could have been better utilized.<br /><br />The loop closes - The programming, pounding beat and huge build up almost justify yet another set of uninspired lyrics...almost. But, said lyrics and, once again, the build up with no payoff massively detract from this.<br /><br />Hallowed ground - Whereas &#34;Recursive self-improvement&#34; sounds like a Social Network b-side, this sounds like a reenvisioning of the last track from that score, &#34;Soft Trees Break The Fall&#34;. Like...a lot. I mean, obviously, it's different; more organic and all that, but still...wow. Also, having a long instrumental, then a song with two lines of lyrics repeated over and over again and then another long instrumental as the last three tracks on your album? Youch. Did you really have nothing else? I would have been perfectly happy with a reinterpretation of &#34;A Drowning&#34; (the beautiful if straightforward closer from their 2010 EP), a perfect final track.<br /><br />I have never experienced an album in which the visual and aural components are more perfectly married. You can hear the jumpy, VHS glitch art in the music, and see the distressed, pixelated sound in all the artwork.<br />It is flat out singular.<br />I also really enjoy hearing some of the sounds that went into both the Social Network and Girl With The Dragon Tattoo scores set to lyrics and in a more focused and melodic framework (except when they too closely resemble the source material). This album is a true amalgam and evolution of those scores and their debut EP.<br />There's also the themes: those of blind or lost faith, ancient religions, fulfilled prophecies, apocalyptic mistakes and old, forgotten gods reemerging and returning just in time for the end of days, perhaps summoned by believing (or not believing) in the wrong (or right) things.<br />In a nutshell, the fatal consequences of belief.<br /><br />When set against the often overwhelmingly trite and uninspired lyrics, the lack of resolution on some of the songs and the fact that there are two long and lackluster instrumentals that account for almost a quarter of the album...yeah, this is still a really great album.<br />Yes, it doesn't end well, but the beginning and middle are just stunning, again, like nothing I've ever heard.<br />So, how about this:<br />Trent and Atticus? You guys are good to go, keep doing what you're doing.<br />Rob? Keep up the good work, your visuals are just knocking it out of the park on every level.<br />Mariqueen? You sound great, but let's try and put a little more work into your lyric writing skills, okay?<br />Great.<br />I'll see you guys in 2024, when your next album comes out.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Wonderful with all the series and the extras.  Enjoyed watching also knowing I have the series to watch again at my own pace.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is interesting and fun. It makes you think. I also like that the characters talk instead having to read the text. It not only makes it a better game but you dont have to speed read.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|LOVE this book.<br />This is a book that could clearly save your life.<br />Teaches the importance of our gifts and natural laws.<br />Opens up a whole new world.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|LIstened to this Cd for most of a 3 hour road trip last week and could keep listening to it for years.
098478280X|5.0|Having to pass a job interview may be a very demanding process. This book was a real help for me in that it not only explained how to give the right answer, but also-and even more important- what to do if it doesn&#34;t come to me in the first minutes after the question is thrown. An interview doesn&#34;t test only your knowledge,but also how you behave under pressure.Chapter VI discusses the interview problems strategies and patterns.Of a real help are the object-oriented and multithreading chapters .I think, in the future, an algorithm chapter may be added.In conclusion it is a good preparing book for the mid-senior programming interview.
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|The only thing I have an issue with is the fact that there is no way to sign in (or sign out) on this app, which would allow me access AccuRadio music choices made on my other devices, also it can only be seen vertically.  Hopefully AccuRadio is not done with the adjusting phase!<br />Other wise this is the most genre accurate radio app I have tried to date.
B00271HAK8|2.0|We found the humor to be rather corny, the acting unimpressive and the adult stereotypes way overdone. We did not get very far before switching and were glad it was Prime and did not cost us extra.
B00BHMETKC|2.0|Belabored, overwrought feel to the plot line.  Other than that, nothing especially gripping or interesting about it.  Maybe I've just seen too many movies, but It seemed just another angle on the trite rescue genre.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Superb documentary!  It won the Oscar!  Go and buy it and watch it again and again.<br />You will not  be disappointed.
B00002DE4E|5.0|I purchased this on vinyl when it came out - 1979 maybe? People, let me tell you, this f'ing blew me away, totally. I used to listen to this album when I was already down, and while drinking huge amounts of alcohol.  It was devastating and redemptive, at the same time.  How to explain this music??  Let's see - powerful, depressing to an unbelievable extreme, yet uplifting in a way only you, when you listen to it, can understand.  Excruciatingly painful, and beautiful.  I own about 2,500 vinyl albums and CDs, and this is one of the greatest ones in my collection.  My feeble review doesn't come close to expressing how fantastic this album is.  Words like \\"fantastic\\" seem trite, in fact.  I am in absolute awe of this album.
B0028N6WAE|5.0|Very good book for English learners. It helps me a lot to understand English. Phrasal Verb are a bit tricky to use and to understand for foreigners.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|kinda of slow but enjoyed it, the movie was not worth seeing after reading the book. enjoy the killing floor.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Up is one of my favorite movies EVER.  Has it all - laughs, romance, a good message.  Beautifully done.  SQUIRREL!
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is a great app. I love getting on here and pinning so many wonderful things; things I would never think about creating or purchasing.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Excellent soundtrack!  I just wish I had known about Rodriguez years ago!!!<br />Have played both his albums daily since seeing the movie and buying them.<br />You will not be disappointed.
B000003TA4|2.0|C'mon people, this album wasn't the 2nd coming of Christ!!  In fact, it's a rather average album, from a band led by a junkie over-rated - well, whatever you wanna call him- guitarist, song-writer, singer, whatever.  I'm not saying he sucked, but, well he was Sooooooooooo over-rated.  How about Kurt's blatent rip-off of Killing Joke's guitar riff of \\"Eighties\\" - only Cobain played it sooooooooo slow - because he was a useless junkie, I suppose.  And when he killed himself - oh...boo-hoo.  Come on - it *is* sad when a person takes his own life.  But, Curt Cobain was a LOSER.  Don't try to make him out to be a hero.  He was anything but.  Oh - and you wanna know a guitar hero from the Pacific Northwest (\\"grunge\\" - I HATE that label), who was/is light years ahead of sad-sack Kurt - Greg Sage.  Those in the know KNOW this is a no-brainer!  RIP Curt.
B004UID2LC|4.0|ok if it says searching and never downloads stuff. delete and reinstall it. all of ur videos have been saved in the gallery!
B004JMSIRC|5.0|Okay, it's been out for a while & most fans of the genre have already seen it, but for my money, Iron Man set a new standard for Supers movies. Robert Downey Jr. is the ideal person to play the troubled tragic hero, Tony Stark. Jeff Bridges makes a great Obidiah Stane & Gwenyth Paltrow is okay as Pepper Potts. My only casting disappointment was Terrence Howard as James Rhodes, as he was just a bit stiff & the part did not seem to be natural for him.<br /><br />The only real downside of the movie is the ever present origin story. You would think that the studios would realize it really isn't necessary. (I mean was there an origin story for Gandalf in Lord of the Rings? Did anyone miss it?) At least they wove the origin part of the movie into the plot line & I am quibbling a bit here to find fault with this flic.<br /><br />If you are a fan of comics, if you like action / adventure & if you have not yet seen this movie, then you are missing out.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I was taken in by this book and found myself amazed by the twists and turns as I read on. Excellent ending!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Highly recommended reading, very exciting plot. I would read the rest of the series. The book was a good length, very interesting.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Excellent !!!!  Every song is superb. This is a raw and fabulous album.<br />I can't believe that it was not a hit when it was first released but am<br />thankful that I now know about this huge talent that was so famous<br />and a stepping stone for so many young South Africans and Australians<br />years ago!
B004J4WNL2|4.0|At times superficial and boring until the last section, I initially gave this book 3 stars. The last part is about navigating relationships between introverts & extroverts, which is the most practical information in the book.  Because this section was so useful, I decided to go back & re-read the other parts to see if I had missed the point.  Indeed I had!  A solid 4-star review after a second reading, if still too many generalizations.  I'm glad to have read it & recommend it to everyone.
B008LY9AWG|5.0|I have enjoyed ALL the Connelly books I've read.  Even though Bosch is my favorite of his characters, Connelly's ability to tell a story is superb.  So, if you enjoy personality stories, mystery, a touch of romance and just an overall &#34;good&#34; read, grab a book by Connelly.  Makes no difference if its a book of short stories or a full length novel, I feel sure you will enjoy it.
B0021L8V1Q|3.0|Okay, the casting is first rate. The special effects are special, but the plot left something to be desired. In the first installment of the series we are introduced to Obidiah Stane. Loved it, but in the sequel we immediately get Justin Hammer, who is portrayed as a bumbling incompetent. The two main villains are too similar to be brought in back to back making the plots too similar to be interesting. I would have much preferred if they had chosen a different villain, such as The Mandarin as the main adversary for the second installment in the series.<br /><br />That said, if you haven't seen it, it is worthwhile, though I much prefer the original movie & I have hopes for something better in this years release.
B00BMCAM6M|4.0|This app is AWESOME! The unlimited skips are awesome. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the fact that it's free!<br /><br />My only objection is the sound quality. It's not too bad-it's bearable, but could be better.<br /><br />I recommend it if you are looking for a good solid free music radio app.
B008M7BQHE|4.0|Keeps it going, and keeps it interesting. If you've seen the first two seasons, it gives you good motivation to keep watching! If you haven't, I recommend you catch up.
B004SVM7BW|4.0|The App i very fast and light and it work very well but I hope they will improve an important feature as soon as possible: the possibility to underline text in scanned PDF. I don't think it will be very difficult... I only need to draw some transparent and coloured line on my text ;-)<br />Bye<br /><br />I'm waiting for this improvement to give 5 stars...
B005M2A4D4|5.0|What more do I need to say?  Doctor Who is the longest running sci-fi program in the world, and it's always worth seeing over and over again.
B000SGSU58|5.0|This one kept me guessing! If you like mysteries, I would recommend reading this book. I couldn't put it down.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is so much fun to do. I would tell all my friend's to try this app. Great for all ages; fun for everyone.
B000HIVOFU|4.0|SACD was supposed to be the step up in sound over CDs, but there aren't many titles.<br />This one includes many of the long time favorite audiophile test tracks, in the best form available.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|We loved the movie when we saw it at the theaters but have had issues with the blue ray disc.The first dvd froze up in the first 1-2 minute and I returned it for replacement.  The second DVD also froze up in the exact same spot of which I also notified Amazon and I have not heard back on what will be done.  Are they sending me another or just giving me a credit.  I will be contacting the customer service rep today.
0143120530|3.0|The mind hacks presented in this book are pretty cool. I'm u sing them now in my own personal life.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|The Doctor is back, and he's saving the world again!  Well worth watching over and over again!  Great sci-fi adventure!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This movie made a fitting ending to the Dark Knight trilogy.  If you haven't seen it, but have seen the other two, then I highly recommend you pick up a copy.
B008518MOW|5.0|We loved the 3D upgrade to the show that we had already watched repeatedly.  Clever dialogue combined with unique ideas make it fun to watch.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|Has degenerated into a costume soap opera. Is it still in the20s? Is it on the cusp of the Great Depression or just domestic bathos? Who really cares?
0547564651|5.0|Tough tells us what, I believe, we know instinctually; that &#34;smarts,&#34; alone can't guarentee a productive life.  &#34;Grit,&#34; however will.  Hard work, curiosity and persistence, &#34;Grit,&#34; will always outwork &#34;smarts.&#34;  You know people who are the smartest people in the world, suppossedly.  Yet they stumble from one thing to another.  These folks have no &#34;Grit.&#34;  and you know people with &#34;Grit.&#34;  These folks have worked hard and have led very successful lives, and they were 150th out of a class of 350.<br /><br />I  loaned this book to two other friends and will lend it to many more.  But first, I'm going to reread it.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My 2 year old loves this app. He's awesome at the puzzles and gets a proud smile when he finishes one. :)
0783229364|4.0|This was one of Michael J. Fox's &#34;sleepers&#34;, but it's always a good movie to watch.  Glad I found it!
B00BESIKWM|2.0|unlike its predecessor, a movie and a whole lot of games, this film lacked atmosphere, intensity and the half ounce of maturity. tacky. goofy.  predictable. less like alice in wonderland, more like power rangers if you know what i mean, no hopelessness like the games provide a decent sense of. there is a small bit of design that was pretty remarkable. the mannequin  spider monster was terrific but aside from that it became a lot more generic and a lot less silent hill. as if they felt the film needed to be more like the resident evil movies
B008D19WBQ|4.0|We are Friends junkies and the Blu-ray version is worth buying even if you own the complete series on VHS and on DVD.  The higher definition is a big improvement.  The only thing that keeps me from rating it 5 stars is that a few seconds have been shaved here and there from the show.  Sometimes that is content that I found worth keeping.
B00328R21C|5.0|My grandson loves Star Wars and Legos.. this was a perfect gift for him.  My grandson enjoyed putting the model together and now playing with it and the figures. I liked that the Star Wars figures where included and not a separate purchase.
B007IK44CK|4.0|It was v ery good ,it kept you wondering what was next.Cruise was very sharp in this movie. Whats next,
B00BESCJII|5.0|Best coming-of-age movie I have seen in years!  I laughed and cried.  Great acting by a relatively unknown cast, except for Emma Watson.  Indie films sometimes don't get the exposure that the big blockbusters get, but this is one that should have made a huge splash, not only at the box office, but also when the awards were handed out.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I thought it was great!!!!!!!!!;) &deg;&middot;&deg; it's a fantastic game everyone must try it you can ask u<br />You bff if they like this<br />  U<br /><br />  ~Lauren~
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I would highly recomend this show.  It is well acted, the &#34;plot&#34; is realistic for the time period.  The characters are real.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Great story and relateable. I am not much of a tv watcher but this is one very good shoe. Its very restaint in the characters is one of its most enduring qualities.
B009GEAPYW|4.0|DC really knows how to produce animated feature length movies.  So much could go wrong when interpreting the four part graphic novel that re-invigorated comics.  So much in this adaptation is just spot on. (Thank you DC)  It's not only faithful to Frank Miller's graphic novel, it also adds to it by fleshing out some moments that were shorter in print and refining the look of the characters and Gotham.<br /><br />I watched it three times during my instant video rental, and it holds up extremely well.  If you like this story, you MUST see this because it adds to the legacy of this amazing Batman story.<br /><br />I only gave it four stars because I go weak in the knees for Frank Miller's original graphic novel.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun and easy to use. Super entertaining and has lots of extras, with all the diff city levels and bonus holiday levels.
0399226907|5.0|I remember reading this book all the time when I was a child! It was one of my favorite books just because of all the color inside and the beautiful illustrations. The best part of this book was that there were holes in it. The holes weren't there because the book was ripped and old, but they were there to represent the bites the caterpillar would take out of each food.<br /> This book is very good for children because it teaches them many things. It teaches them the days of the week, different types of food and it also teaches them that a caterpillar eventually turns into a beautiful butterfly. This book is an excellent choice for children and it most certainly will catch their eye because of the elaborate colors on each page of the book.
1576875776|5.0|Wonderful book!  Full of great photographs to loose yourself in.  It will not be all fun and games though.  Vivian Maier outshines so many in her ability as a photographer that one cannot sing her praises without sounding over the top.  This is not a coffee table book you will be able to leaf quickly through.  Allow yourself plenty of time as you will be drawn into each frame and you can't abandon Vivian's people before they have extracted their due from you.  Oh,  and dress comfortabley for you will be time traveling.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Very entertaining, selected for my 4 year old grandson and he enjoys every minute of it<br />We take turns playing
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|What a waste of two hours! Ethan Hawker fumbling in the dark through the whole movie. I was literally yelling for him to turn a light switch, for chrissakes!
B003L77G38|5.0|and I love this show. Fringe is by far one of my favorite sci-fi shows and the third season is truly brilliant.
B004R13U6Y|4.0|I'm so happy that I can highlight pfd files. I was frustrated with the pdf reader of the kindle. This app is super useful when you read and make notes on pdf files.
B006N57PXG|5.0|So disappointed to see all these reviews comparing Nathaniel to Harry Potter. Nathaniel is a remarkable, intelligent boy. A smart-ass and a hard-ass and a real boil to root for. Stroud develops the character of Nathaniel throughout the three novels with exquisite fantasy and rigor. In this plane, nor the next few we know of - 'love' is no ultimate protector. Hard work, these gifted few put in hard work, and their individual missions and wit are out of this world. The enemies and friends(thin line), of Nathaniel and Bartimaeus are even more extraordinary. Pictures painted pointedly mellow in your mind long after you turn the second cover. Stroud writes from multiple perspectives, primarily Nathaniel and Bartimaeus. Keeping us jogging alongside them at a nice pace, Stroud graciously floats us footnotes to explain terminology or foreign words and concepts. I much prefer this to exceedingly tedious dialogue between characters attempting to explain establishing information.<br /><br />Is anyone really surprised at the similarity to Harry Potter?<br />A: OH! It's a boy!<br />B: 50/50 chance<br />A: We start when he's young, at the beginning of his life<br />B: Not the end?<br /><br />When I read it I immediately thought: Theif Lord<br />http://www.amazon.com/The-Thief-Lord-Cornelia-Funke/dp/0545227704/<br /><br />Nathaniel; (the shoy stud who molds his image and knows Just how he is percieved) you identify with, but know you can never live up to. Bartimaeus? The ancient, well seasoned class clown? Sharp, silvertounge devil? You simply fall in love with.<br /><br />Madly yours,<br /><br />As Always<br />The Lovely<br />Annie O
0316077046|5.0|I read the first book and was really excited to read the second installment.  It was so much better then the first, not what I expected at all.  Great read!  Now I'm ready to read the third one!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Lots of fun<br />My grandson and I take turns playing this game and we spent hours enjoying the many levels
B007SGLZP8|4.0|However, IMHO it ended too abruptly.  Good writing throughout, and kept your interest. Worth the price, worth your time to read.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Inspirational and touching to the heart.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to anyone and any age.<br /><br />It's worth buying and having on the shelf!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I really disliked the ending to this book.  So while I was facinated with the twists and turns, by the time I got to the end, I was mad.  Bad people should not go unpunnished.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this season although its the darkest. Transformation is the common thread between the cast of characters as they develop personality traits to help weather each zombie storm.  Hope is lacking for the most part in this season. Selfish survivalist tenacity is more prevalent. Really intense stuff. I'm pretty biased to be giving a review. Love the show.
1455502626|4.0|First off I enjoy DeMille's books in general so it's not hard to like this one. While it is good perhaps 4 stars is a bit high for it.. As always John Corey, the protagonist, is irreverernt, cynical, acerbic, funny and entertaining but the story seems overlong and unduly stretched out near the end taking on the character of the perils of Pauline. To me it's not in the class of &#34;the Lions Game&#34;, &#34;The Lion&#34; or &#34;Word of Honor&#34;.
B00BESM14U|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower was an amazing film.  Everything in the movie was perfect.  It is rare that you come across a movie like that.  I would recommend this movie to anyone older than a teenager.  It was a terrific movie.  You should definitely watch it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it so addicting  I am always like okay just after I get the next mystery box
B008KOTNVA|5.0|This is possibly the nicest tool kit ive ever owned... Very high quality bits and driver. For this price, you cant get better. Bought this to open my rMBP and had no issues.
B005HEFB6M|3.0|Maybe not the best of the franchise but still fun to watch in spots. Concept of this was how it started was good just seems to fall flat.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|A young read but good.  Love the twist and turns of the plot! I would recommend it. Will check out Colleen's other books.
B004ZGI2KK|4.0|Really enjoyed this version of Little Red Ridinghood.  Good mystery and thriller movie.  Definitely recommended for those who enjoy werewolf movies.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I started watching this series while I was on bedrest in the hospital and needed to pass the time. I started marathon watching and was caught up from season 1-3 in a weekend! Love the ease of watching it on Amazon Prime!
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I think this book is really amazing<br />I can tell you this is a good book amazing just amazing<br />Bye
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I am a sucker for a bag with lots of pockets and this has it, it also provides great care for my camera and lenses.  I am an accident waiting to happen and when I dropped this bag from quite high up onto cement, I didn't hear that usual sound that a protective bag makes that is not really protecting your equipment.  I am very happy!
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|They need to put more of the music they danced too in it, some of the music sounds like a repeat however all of it is beautifully orchestrated and in some cases you can even see the scenes in your mind when listening
B00B2V66VS|3.0|He liked it and was able to play it very easily. I will keep it for him.  It was free
B003XMAD3G|5.0|I bought this RAM for my brand new QNAP NAS TS-469L and it works great. It is a big savings compared to QNAP's memory.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|A classic laugh out loud funny movie..... Product is in perfect shape.  If you liked this one you will love 9 to 5. Its another lol classic.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching fire is the best book ever. I like mocking Jay the best though. I love these books! They are the best!!!
B004EPYZUI|4.0|I don't know what the original version is like because I haven't had a chance to watch it.  I liked the extended cut but was not happy with this long crazy musical like dance number that happened in the beginning.  The movie  could have done without that.  Other then that I enjoyed this move which I watched with my mom and she enjoyed it too, including the musical number.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I Love this app, It make's printing wireless the only way to go. This app is very easy to set up the very first time.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|Deleted it, to small to veiw<br />Difficult to read, did not like, glad it was free<br />Have a cube one I use constantly.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|wall-e is a movie purist's dream: an impeccably-crafted script, indelibly drawn and realized characters, lavish set design, powerful themes, deft direction and a memorable score. Oh, yeah...its also an animated movie; but, being as its from Pixar, that's like saying Lawrence Olivier was just an actor.<br /><br />If you have never seen this masterpiece, forget the 'cute robots', and invest some time well-spent to nourish the emotional, cerebral, comedic and 'green' facets of your spirit. You will thank yourself for doing so; and, will likely sit back down again for an immediate 2nd viewing.<br /><br />For those who have already experienced the joy of 'wall-e'...time to watch it again!
B0083Z6AH6|2.0|From the Jane Austen books that I have read, this one was a disappointment, since I really enjoyed Pride and Prejudice and Reason and Sensibility. I didn't feel anything while reading the book, the main characters didn't seemed all that interested in each other, and I couldn't even root for them to be together. It was quite boring.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|The movie was enjoyable.  Not great, but entertaining for what it was.  This is one where you just want to put up your feet and go for a ride.  Most of the time 3D doesn't add much for me, but as amazing imagery carries this movie I think it had a place here.
B005LAII08|5.0|This movie is amazing!  It has a great lesson that every mother and daughter should watch together, maybe several times a month!
B002BI6SMI|5.0|IT IS A GREAT MOVIE, LOADED WITH A LOT OF ACTION.  I HAVE WATCHED IT SEVERAL TIMES AND STILL NOT TIRED OF WATCHING IT
B007SGM084|3.0|It was easy to read but it got a bit too much with the sex.  There could have been a bit more substance
B00BBQXQFI|4.0|When 'Rise of the Guardians' came out in theaters, my 10 year-old daughter and 16 year-old son declined the chance to see it...despite being animation junkies. The reason was simple: all of the studio's ads and marketing made it clear that this was aimed at little kids. Funny thing, though...when those little kids and their parents went to see it, they weren't too pleased; and, the movie underperformed at the box office.<br />After watching it at home, its easy to understand why:<br /><br />This is an action movie, with some serious themes (death, self-image, resurrection, revenge), and a particularly scary villain.<br />As such, it would have scared the daylights out of most tots. However, my kids and I found the animation imaginative, the concept of Holiday-Icon-As-Superhero to be refreshing, the voice acting superb and the action set-pieces to be stirring.<br /><br />That said, there is a real problem with the film's own self-image. It veers wildly from giddy/silly into (very) dark/dangerous and back again; and, often without a logical reason why. Had the film spent more time telling its story, instead of trying to simply entertain, it might have been a classic.<br /><br />Regardless, this is a worthwhile investment for any fan of good animated movies and/or their kids (ages 10 & up).<br />Chris Pine and Jude Law (as Jack Frost and Pitch Black the Boogieman) bring depth and emotion to their characterizations; and, both Alec Baldwin and Hugh Jackman are a scream in their roles of North (Santa) and the Easter Bunny.<br /><br />I strongly recommend 'Rise of the Guardians'
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Overall it was a great read.  I found that the story kept me entertained most of the time. I only found myself a little disappointed in the fourth book, since to me it seemed that nothing really exciting happened in it. Most of the scenes seemed only like preparation for what's to come. Some of it I found interesting, the rest not so much.<br />I'm definitely going to read the next one.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My 4 yo eats these up. He mad over 200,000 points first hour.<br />I recommend this app for all ages
B003Y5H556|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I like the twist that it provided but kept the best traditions of the story!  Lots of great miss direction to that kept me guessing.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The characters have such great voices in this story. They speak in a genuine Irish way, with the inflections and thought processes that you would expect from that lovely country.
B00AKS656U|5.0|Sometimes they be cheating but it is fun never gets old I play it all the time it is sometimes a challenge
B00APJLFEG|3.0|Dracula as loving husband and protective father? I apologized to the shade of Bela Lugosi, and took a shot on this film, at the urging of my 11 year-old daughter. Ah, the things we parents do out of love for our kids...<br /><br />The concept of a monster spa, where they could rest, free from the 'terror' of humanity is a cool idea. Unfortunately, the characterizations and 'script' (?) quickly degenerated into a faux hip-hop 'tude, creaky old sitcom gags, Adam Sandler cliches (burps, farts, etc.) and enough treacle and bathos to send the audience into sugar-shock.<br /><br />Not the worst animated movie out there...but, certainly much closer to 'Scooby-Doo' than 'Nightmare Before Christmas'.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I liked that the book surprised me. I really was expecting it to be much more focused on a teenager romance, but it was much more then that. It's focused on issues that are current in our society. Why do we find the social differences absurd in a book, but not in real life?
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I hated it to be over.  I was able to put myself right in the story!  I didn't want to put it down.
B00BESM14U|4.0|I was excited about seeing this movie until I read the description, however it is good and enjoyed the cast.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I like it it is only a little boring waiting for the coins to replenish but the fact that they replenish i cool so you don't have to pay to get more coins
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This was a great read!! The plot twist on the last few pages was fantastic. I really enjoyed the character development and plot. Makes one second guess small towns with old money.
B003O86FMW|3.0|In my opinion, this is the weakest book in the series, but  it's  still a fun and easy to read book.
0547848412|5.0|I enjoy reading the book before seeing the movie. This is a really fun story. Arrived quickly and perfectly new.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I totally love dance and music movies, and this is no exception. It is funny and the music and hearing this actress'/actors sing absolutely love.  Huge fan of Anna Kendrick and Skylar Astin!
B001XUIBNO|4.0|This is a remake of a classic.  With the cast, costumes, setting, etc. this has become a classic in its on right.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun app for both young and old. I play this with my daughter and she loves it.
8866134627|4.0|I use this more for personal use, so I guess that's why I gave it 4 stars. It is more set up for professional projects but I really like the index in the back. I need a place to put down my thoughts and to dos and this is just  great for that.
B000QELMF2|5.0|I bought this as a cake decoration for my daughter's 10th birthday. She is really into the fairies this year. Very well made and durable.
0316069906|5.0|And after I read it I swore off meats for a couple of years; until they decided to allow animals to run around humanely on some farms, and sell that meat to us. Then I felt I could possibly live with eating organic fed, happy, sun kissed, grass gorged, never fed a hormone or antibiotic animal. But you have to wonder....is it true? Were they NEVER given an antibiotic like it says? Or is that a bunch of cow........you know?  Like said, will change your way of eating. We do eat meat, but less of it. It used to be the center platter, now its a tiny side dish or a sparse addition to a vegetable based meal.We pay more for meat raised humanly and butchered ( what do they call it? Halal , by hand, not machine ) We buy chicken minimally processed that soaked up less than 5% of the chlorinated s*** bath it soaks in to kill the feces and germs. We try. So we buy less. Which is good for the world anyway. Next book I read will be how to cook bugs! mmmm, crunchy! ( only organic, grass fed, antibiotic and non GMO bugs )
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren are superb as Hitchcock and Alma.  As a Hitchcock fan it was interesting to see behind the scenes of the making of the classic Psycho.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|................................ ....... .......  ..... .... .... ....  ...  ...  .Hugh Laurie to come up that the game last year maybe you have there are going through that or not
B003LXSY60|5.0|I lloovvvveee the black keys. Brothers is one of my favorite albums they have released. If you're into the Black Keys and their style definitely recommend this one!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Supernatural is one series I've been hooked on from the start.  They've always found a way to keep the interest.  I love these boys!!
B009K72G8I|4.0|Besides the droid arc in the second half of the season, I loved all the episodes of this season. The young Jedi episodes were fantastic, as were the Darth Maul/Savage episodes, the Onderon arc, and the powerful Ahsoka episodes at the end. This season is a must-see for Star Wars fans.
0670026603|3.0|I found \\"Me Before You\\" to be a very gripping novel.  The author telegraphs how it will end:<br /><br />\\"Why do you think your friend/charge/whatever needs his mind changed? If I could work out a way of dying with dignity, and if I didn't know it would devastate my family, I would take it. I have been stuck in this chair eight years now, and my life is a constant round of humiliations and frustrations. Can you really put yourself in his shoes? Do you know how it feels to not even be able to empty your bowels without help? To know that forever after you are going to be stuck in your bed unable to eat, dress, communicate...\\"<br /><br />The book is gripping from the onset.  The descriptions of what it is like to be a quadriplegic (as Will, the protagonist is) are spot on.  Moyes is at her best when she is describing what Will's existence is like, catheters and all.  His life is pain; he is unable to do the simplest things for himself.  He cannot feed himself, scratch his nose or scratch his butt.  His existence depends on caregivers and drugs.  He can, however, speak, and he has very limited use of his hands.  The foil is Lou, who is hired to provide companionship and hopefully a spark which will make him want to continue his miserable existence.<br /><br />Despite Lou's best efforts, Will carries out his plan.  The book is a bit contrived.  It would have been better had Will's character been a bit more believable.  In the book he is handsome beyond belief, a multimillionaire before 35; he climbed Mount Kilimanjaro and much more.  In his spare time he became a wine connoisseur, art expert, literary critic and well some other stuff which I forgot.<br /><br />So why if the book is a bit contrived did I like it so much?  Fair question.  I liked it because it totally advocates (in my opinion) for death with dignity.  Will's existence was totally miserable and bound to get even more miserable.  Describing Will's misery, bouts with pneumonia, attempted suicide and more are depicted with vivid realism.  The description of his suicide attempt is a very powerful argument for death with dignity.  The author obviously did some serious research.  I also liked it because the author showed how valuable support groups can be, in this case internet support groups.  Finally, I liked it because the antagonist, Lou, was extremely gullible and a hopeless romantic, albeit a selfish romantic.<br /><br />I read the book quickly because it is an easy read and I very much wanted to see how it ended.  Moyes copped out on the ending.  The book should have followed Will through death.  It didn't.  In defense of Moyes, she probably didn't know how to write the ending.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|... what i said before, its good. Its fun. You may not take this review for real but i seriously do like it. But the game made me do this review, so 'm ow im trying to go back to playing it.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Different from the Airborne version of Bank of Brothers but in its way quite good.  I was interested in the Pacific theatre having had uncles serving in the 1st Marine Battalion.  Worth watching.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I can't wait for season 4 ; I will buyt when avaiable.  Please continue with the series & he current characters.
B009P5S11G|3.0|The album has some good songs but some could be omitted in my opinion. But an ok album none the less, songs that are not liked works as background music to buffer the sound of nothing.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Interesting turn at the end.  Won't spoil for others.  I have enjoyed this trilogy and hope for another book soon.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Love it, so original, Hilarious, Romantic, Scientific, And Awesome I hope you make more books Funny Your fan, Keith P Masterson.
B008Y73940|4.0|This was a very good movie with a bit of a twist. I would rent it again if given the choice.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I enjoyed this book the moment I picked it up. The magic of the circus sure touched the reader as well.
B005TZFZJC|5.0|The entire album keeps you entertained from track one right to the end. If your a true rihanna fan this album does not dissappoint.
B008PZZV8S|3.0|Maybe it's because its a 13 year old movie, but it just didn't seem that interesting.  Matt Damon and Gwyneth Paltrow were actually the two weakest players I would however give Jude Law 5 stars for his performance.  Story line was kind of weak and you never fall in love with Damon's character.  Not that you're suppose to like him, its just one of those dark dramas that leaves you wanting at the end.  I wouldn't watch it again and I certainly wouldn't buy it on disc.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Absolutely LOVE this game!!<br />The dragons are cute and lovable,and my grandkids like feeding the dragons.<br /><br />We love, love it!!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What more can I say about Downton Abbey. DVD came quickly!<br />Now waiting for Season 4 to be filmed & come out!
B0000DCGT0|5.0|No problem at all with this used DVD.  It played perfectly and of course is a thrilling and inspiring story.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I LOVE THIS......I HAVE LEARNED SOOOO  MUCH FROM PINTEREST AND LOOK AT THIS SITE EVERYDAY AND CAN STAY ON IT FOR HOURS.....I LOVE IT AND RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE.....
0140449337|5.0|This is my first introduction to Stoic philosophy. Even though this written several thousand years ago, it is very good advice that applies to this day and time, too.
B008CPRLP2|3.0|I haven't had a need for it yet and can't rate it fairly at this time because I have not used it at all.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I AM HAVING A GREAT TIME! My husband is beginning to question what has me so obsessed. I think about my next ride throughout the day.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is one of the best TV shows ever made.  The survival that the actors show, whether good or bad illustrates some of what you need to do in any emergency situation.
B009HELT3C|4.0|I was skeptical of this movie at first but the story really surprised me. I like how the tied everything together from past movies.
B000FBFN1U|3.0|This would be a four or five star review, but the books have way too many characters to keep up with that do not add to the story line. Besides that, if you follow the main characters, it is a great storyline.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's been awhile since I have been this spellbound by a book. I think it speaks to the dangers of what could happen within our society with our preoccupation with reality tv and violence. I can't wait to read the next installment.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Enjoy playing the game, but the 500k lifetime coin mission doesn't work right. The bar is stuck at about 1/3 even though I have over the goal. I wish there was a report bug button within the game. Hopefully the creators read these reviews and fix the problems.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|Somehow the original version of Google just disappeared from my tablet and search board replaced it.  How do I get the original Google back?  Search board offers no improvement only more key strokes to get to where I want to be.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|The movie was well written with a ton of humor yet had a real story to it. I enjoyed every minute of this movie.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|I can't believe how underrated this movie was.  It was absolutely fantastic.  I went into it thinking &#34;whatever, Bruce Willis&#34; but it was thoughtful and thought-provoking.  I am still thinking about it months later.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I never thought I'd be interested in just another book about the Kennedy assignation, but Steven's book is more of a love story than a dry account of a plot to stop it.<br /><br />This book proves that Stephen King has still got it. Boy, can this guy write.<br /><br />virg
B009K0P10K|5.0|Great show, can't wait for the next one. The suspense keeps you glued to the tv and many surprises to come.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|But badly written - limited vocab. Yes, that's army-talk, but none the less, it comes across as smutty, sadly. I'm still pleased I read it, since it does give some insight into the US war effort in Afganistan.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Especially enjoyed this one, just like the original game. Recommended to anyone that is into the little yellow man that munched on pac dots and ghosts.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Harrowing, suspenseful, scary, terrifying.  And that's only the first 15 minutes.  Everyone knows it's about a plane crash so I'm not giving anything away but...after the plane actually crashed, I had to pry my fingers from the armrests of my chair and walk around the house to clear my head.  It's just that effective.  The rest of the movie you root for the alcoholic that is Denzel.  You want him to kick the habit and you are disappointed when he fails time and time again.  Bravo Denzel as usual!
B004F1F32A|3.0|The movie was terrific, great action, good plot but it hung for five-ten minutes at a time.  No other channels including the notorious VUDU hung up this way on that day, so it must have been the Amazon feed. Boring
B008Y6ZK5C|1.0|This video is the same quality of the VHS I recorded when it aired on tv when I was a kid. Would like to return this, Amazon!
B0095P33IW|2.0|This a old video. diappointed with prime. I thought I would get new and update videos to watch. I can see the same video cable TV.
B004I744AS|5.0|Nice to have a dictionary that is readily accessible and easy to use. Recommended to anyone that uses one frequently.
B00ARAN9JW|2.0|Love these movies but this one really sucked.  I think they are running out of ideas.  Shame because we really love the other ones.
B0027MJU00|1.0|This is one of the worst books I've ever read. I can't believe that Gillian Flynn is the same author who wrote the marvelous \\"Gone Girl\\" - a sophisticated and baffling mystery. I forced myself to finish reading \\"Dark Places\\" but I didn't want to. There is not one likable or even acceptable character in it, nothing but bottom feeders living lives of noisy and smelly desperation.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book, wish there was another one! All three books are awesome! Now looking for my next read! Need to write a book about his side.
B004EPYZQC|4.0|I saw half of the movie on cable this month, but I wanted to experience it with my surround system. Amazon delivered it next morning, so I could have it for guests in the evening. The movie and delivery, 5 Stars.
B0063IH60K|2.0|My personal opinion of this game is that it is boring. However I am not a big fan of this type of game.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Not only was this informative, it brought me back to my childhood/teen years.  The musci is outstanding, you get an inside look at the singers/groups recording their successful albums from the 70's, 80's and 90's.  As soon as the movie was over, I downloaded a ton of music I hadn't heard in a very long time.  Great job, Dave Grohl, for acknowledging this studio and the importance it held in our lives (even if we didn't know it).
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones fit together in an uneasy partnership.<br />Straight face humor, full of surprises and great fun.<br />Recommend to Smith, Jones and MIB fans.<br />If you are not a fan, get all three MIB movies and you will be.
1451695195|5.0|I not only read the book and found it facinating, but borrowed the book to my mother and she now is reading it and very intrigued by it
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I would recommend this book for both boys and girls 8+.  I rated the book 5 stars because it showed me that it's fine to be friends with people that are different because they may become your best friend in the future so don't let them down.
B004GYY714|5.0|Great app that lets you pick your own radio station to listen to. There is a wide variety of  stations available
B000000P17|5.0|Guns & Roses were a band of misfits that couldn't write an original song to save their lives, but they did great covers. Thus, this album full of (mostly) punk covers is definitely the best thing they ever did. Guitar solos are great, Axel's singing is great, and Duff's singing fits the material quite well. A maximum volume album that stands the test of time (which is more than I can say for Use Your IIlusion self-indulgence...)
B0099Y2MYK|3.0|The DVD I received was NOT an original U.K. version.  There were a number of scenes on the television version that are not on my DVD.  This was also the situation on the DVDs for Season 1 and Season 2.  Why are they advertised as &#34;uncut&#34; when they are not &#34;uncut.&#34;
B009K45Y62|5.0|This is by far one of the best gifts I've given my fiancé. It is an amazing case and I can't imagine a better collector's edition.
B009T9P7OC|1.0|distorts audio speed and can not correct the file back to the original correct speed. Called customer service and they were unable to find a solution
B0054JZC6E|2.0|Didn't like anything about this game. Not enough variety or style. Recommended maybe to the younger generations but not for me.
B00AYB1RXE|5.0|Even if you don't usually like documentaries, you should watch this one.  The story is amazing.  It is masterfully told.  It deserved the Oscar it won.  You will become a fan of Rodriquez's music after having watched Searching For Sugarman.  Such a great story.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This is a great book series that I highly recommend for teens or anyone interested in science fiction novels. Five stars by a book lover.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A must read.<br />Best book on book store by far.<br />Way more detail than movie.<br />Promise you will love it.
B000FC11JW|5.0|I'll be honest, that's one of the best book for managers that I had read. I took me 5 days since it was very interesting and easy to read.
B0096DFBZQ|4.0|Enjoyed playing the game, if you like pac man you should enjoy this but with a little twist. You race in a car instead of eating pac dots.
B00ARA4SLU|3.0|Not sure I understand why anyone needs both the Blu-ray AND  DVD version of this movie. And at 33.00? How about either/or for ,oh, I don't know,$16.99?
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I read this book in two days. I couldn't put it down. I can say I pictured the characters from tv the whole time but enjoyed the whole story.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|The pairing of hard-nosed, crusty Clint as the father and saucy, driven, hard-edged (she is is daughter, after all) Amy is genius. The relationship -- to each other and to baseball -- is engaging, funny, tender, crass, tough to watch and you can't take your eyes off it.<br /><br />A worthy tribute to baseball's old-time scouts and the game itself. There are golden edges to every scene.
B0015T6G2G|1.0|It was very diffult to read it and too long. I couldn't remember names since they were African.<br /><br />I could read more than 10%.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|I have only had this for a,short.time but love it already. Easy to use and a great way to keep all your videos, photos and songs organized.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Without revealing any spoilers, I thought I had this book all figured out, and that the author was all about making men look like childish jerks and women look like hard-suffering do-no-wrong types.  I told my girlfriend I was disappointed with the book because it had gotten great reviews but wasn't what I was expecting... just a female author trying to tell a story from two perspectives, and of course the woman's perspective was the heroin, and the guy's perspective was a sketchy selfish creep.  Then I realized I was only halfway done with the book (a surprise new to the e-reader experience), the author had spun the first half so cleverly that I had been completely duped, and the story was not at all what it seemed to be.  Well done Gillian Flynn, I consider myself a pretty bright guy, and you had me completely fooled.  From there on, I couldn't put it down.  Other reviewers have complained about the ending, personally I thought the ending was just as dark and clever as the rest of the book.  5 stars!
B001P1MZNI|5.0|kick ass sound track. Frank is the shiza. Count Basie and his orchestra do a phenomenal job at the sands in this disk.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I was an X-files fan, loved the mix of paranormal, aliens and conspiracy story lines however I always felt the series could have went just a tad further.  I feel that Fringe takes that final step both visually and story line.  Granted Fringe visually speaking has the advantage of modern special FX so I can't fairly hold that against the X-files.  Having said that I still find Fringe to be narratively superior.  Season one captured my imagination with its crisp story telling and character developement. Anna Torv does an excellant job of bring dept to her character and making the viewer care about her. Joshua Jackson does a good job of portraying the cynical world weary underacheivering loner that is hiding his need to be a part of a group and to be more than he is deep down. Overall I give the first season 5 out of five stars, it was entertaining and captures the imagination.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Quite the page-turner. It's  a bit of a younger book, almost like a Harry Potter, and could have benefited from some more adult themes considering the amount of violence. However it's almost a \\"Disney\\" kind of violence and not terribly inappropriate for pre-teens. Somewhat less graphic and dramatic than Lord of the Flies.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This story was very entertaining, interesting, and educational.  I can't wait to see the movie.  I hear that it's best to see the big screen, 3D version.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|ive seen all of the movies and have been whaiting for the game for years this is the best app there is for people who loved the movies and dinos
B005CA4SQK|5.0|Very very scarey. I even wetted myself a few times watching. That Rick guy is crazy! I hope they make it out of their situation.
B001N4OX82|4.0|There are so many lengthy and detailed reviews on here, I'll just give my two cents. I wasn't crazy about Troy when I first saw it. I thought it was disjointed and uneven, and while Brad Pitt was a great-looking guy, his performance seemed flat. Later, when I watched it again, I realized how good his performance was. He was the greatest warrior, but you could see he was tired of being at the top, tired of being unchallenged. That scene with him and the slave girl in the tent was electrifying, and when Peter O'Toole comes to him to plead for the body of his son, well, that was a golden moment. I love Peter O'Toole anyhow, and he still can dominate the screen with his quiet magnetism. The weak points of the film were Orlando Bloom and his Helen, both of whom seemed vapid, although I suppose that's how they were supposed to be. Anyhow, this is a movie I'll watch again anytime I see it on TV and have the time.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|rented on Amazon instant video,<br /><br />pros:  great action sequences,  interesting introduction of new replacement characters<br /><br />cons:  HD quality was ok, but not as pristine as having a blue ray disc,<br />  not able to have subtitles on TV  - (can have on a computer screen though)<br /><br />  storywise:<br />  the usual unlikelyhood of events happening in the movie - ex. villain single handedly get out of a M16 stronghold;<br />  having no M16 armed support towards the end of the movie; how Bond got out of a frozen lake in time etc...)<br />  but then again it's a Bond film after all<br /><br />if you're a fan of bond films you'll like this , if not you'll probably still find it entertaining enough
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I would of never guessed the twist this story took. I thought it was like every other love story but this one has a unique twist. It also has a wonderful message of strength and courage. I think it's a book every girl should read to know that no matter what bumps you may hit in life, you can get through it. Truly enjoyed reading this book.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend and I reluctantly tried it out.  I was very surprised.  I loved it, couldn't put it down.  I hope she is writing more books!
B00A0SLTCU|5.0|I like the fact that many of the names were the same/ characters. The movie plot resembles the original, but is different in many aspects. This movie is an entirely updated version with excellent graphics, and detail. It had my attention all the way through the movie, waiting for the next suspenseful scene. Non stop action.  It was hard to watch at first without Arnold playing Douglas Quaid, but after a while I accepted Colin Farrell, as the main character. Not quiet as raunchy as the original, nor as much silliness.  This is a more serious version, which I feel stands well on its own merits. A bit more gritty , and realistic as compared to the original.  Overall this is a great movie to watch, or own. The more that you watch it, the better it becomes. Doesn't look cheaply made as the original did, It has been upgraded to the 21st Century.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|David Baldacci never disappoints. If you like the genre, you will like the writing style, the characters and the tightly woven plots. enjoy!
0765334798|4.0|Let me start out by saying I am not a big Star Trek fan, I am more of a Star Wars fan.  The only stuff I really know about Star Trek comes from the new Star Trek movie, and the few episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation that I watched while I was growing up.<br /><br />But this book was terrific!<br /><br />***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***<br /><br />So the members of the crew of the starship “Intrepid” know they are expendable and if they go on away missions with the senior members of the crew, at least one of them is going to die while the senior members of crew will come through unscathed.  Also none of the senior members of the crew seem to realize that they go through crew members like regular people go through pieces of bubble gum.<br /><br />We also find out that the science lab has a magic plot device known as “The Box,” that gives answers by putting elements of the problem inside the box.  Have a crew member dying of an alien disease?  Just stick a sample of the disease inside the box for thirty minutes, it’ll ding and you’ll have your vaccine.  Pretty convenient!<br /><br />So our group of Red Shirts realizes that something is going on and they go looking for answers.  They find a member of the crew, “Jenkins” who is hiding in the bowels of the ship and he reveals to them that they are characters on a TV show.  If that’s not bad enough, it’s not even a GOOD TV show!  So they all make a plan and do one of the most original and creative things I’ve ever seen a group of characters do in a book.  They steal a shuttle, fly into a black hole and enter our universe, land on Earth and go looking for the writer of their show in Hollywood in order to get him to stop killing off characters.<br /><br />Some people use the phrase, “Breaking the 4th Wall,” but this is more like nuking the 4th wall and it was so awesome!<br /><br />They actually do research on the show they are on and they end up looking on our internet.  This book made me chuckle when they were looking on IMDB and when they use Wikipedia, I howled with laughter when they said “how do we know if this information is accurate?”<br /><br />Eventually the Red Shirts find the writer of their show and they find out his son is dying.  They make a deal with him, if they can save his son, no character will ever die on their show again.  They take the writer’s son back through the black hole with them and back on the Intrepid.  They end up healing him with the Box and they seal the deal and the Red Shirts are safe!<br /><br />The rest of the book is not really essential to the plot, it’s made up of four “codas” and they are just the author talking from his point of view about what he just went through.  So if you are just interested in the main storyline, you can safely skip them.<br /><br />***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />I loved this book!  Even though some of the Star Trek in jokes went right over my head and about a quarter of the book seemed like filler.  I still loved this book and I was very glad I read it!  If you’re a hardcore fan or casual fan of Star Trek, you will love this book!  Or even if you just like a funny story you will enjoy it.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love, love, love this show!!! I have seen every episode since day one. The plot, cast, and setting are all perfect.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Glad I read the book, being a non American, though experiencing the measure of sacrifice endured by the author, for a safer world, I tip my hat for him sharing the truth and insight into that world. Was really fun to read about the everyday lives of SEALS, especially the pranks. It is now apparent to that the more elite you get the greater the pranksters abound. I now have some ideas for the popcorn bowl and gas masks.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I liked this program very much.  I loved the story line, the historical accuracy (even though this story is fictional) ,the costumes and the intrigue.  The quality on the screen was excellent.  I would highly recommend this series, but only after watching Season 1.
B005MMYBXI|4.0|I can't look away! It's like watching animals do strange things at the zoo - you want to look away, but can't. After doing some research, it seems that the Romans really were the f**ing a**holes that the series depicts. They have followed the story of Spartacus pretty close to history. Fascinating. I do have to look away from all the extreme gore.
0316044938|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!  From the time I bought it, I had it finished in three days.  I couldn't put it down.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|Nikki found life after death incredible book enjoyed seeing backstage and how he dealt actually did not deal with life glad you are still here.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show!! So glad I can see it on Amazon - since my provider does not have it. This season is so good - it can only get better!
B009X010RU|5.0|This case is amazing! One thing I really love about it is the cover... With the iPad Smartcover it is magnetic with could open if you drop it and quite frequently falls off. (My sister has one for her iPad 2) With this cover it is not magnetic, it's not as heavy, and is made of virtually the same material. Instead of the magnetic cover it is a two-section flip-cover the you strap it on. This really guarantees that it won't open up. The last things i love about this case is that it locks my Kindle in place, also it is like there is nothing over the speakers because the sound isn't muffled at all.
B007ZGO7EM|2.0|If you want a simple four function calculator that has ads displayed it's an okay app. There are better calculators, however.
0345803507|5.0|Great story. Ignore all those that bad mouth it saying it has too much sex in it. They obviously did not read the entire trilogy.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|My kids really like this movie and they also like the reference to some of the video games they play. The message was good too. I really thought it was heartwarming!
B000QRIGLC|3.0|Got it and. It is ok . Specially for the real historic value that is involved.  I like the digital version  since it can be read through my iPad
B007W7P5L8|5.0|I ordered the case cover because everyone I knew that owns a /Kindle said you must buy it with the Kindle to protect it from breakage.  It fits my Kindle Fire perfectly and is attractive besides.
0316228532|1.0|tough read. hard to follow. too many characters.  she needs to stick to tween books. Will resell it if I can.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|I was bummed I did not get to see this in the theater - but we downloaded it from Amazon Prime and watched it the other day and loved it. What a cool concept - both my husband and our kids really enjoyed this.
B000003TAB|5.0|This is a great album from a great band. Has a lot of their less known songs on it. Very good
B00BESIKWM|2.0|I saw the first one in the theater and loved it.  It was unique and scary.  Every time that siren went off it sent chills up my spine.  This sequel has none of that.  The relationship between the father and daughter is forced and not believable.  The premise seems old and done before.  I felt like the director added certain scenes and characters just because they were  in the previous movie and were popular.  This made the movie feel disjointed and pasted together.  I actually fell asleep watching towards the end.  If your looking for the same spine tingling thrill or the first movie you won't find it here.  My advice,  skip it.
0345803493|5.0|Sad the story ended. James needs to continue this story line. I am certain all the true fans would love a part IV, V, VI and so on.
1416511946|4.0|And a must read for anyone that glorifies the rock and roll world. I thought that the daily journal entries would get monotonous, but was pleasantly surprised by how lucid he actually was during his writings.  The current time comments pulled it all together, however I did find myself skipping anything the \\"Evangelist\\" Vanity had to say.  She seemed insane then and still has a few screws loose today.  The rest of it was really quite interesting.
B000PKG6TE|5.0|Queens of the Stone Age is one of my favorite bands. This cd is awesome, just like all of their albums
B00BHMETKC|3.0|I remember when this was happening in real life. I wonder if it was really that close a call or if that was just Hollywood?
0061950726|4.0|Contrary to the title, this book offers a great comparison of two eras and how castaway children were treated.  On the one hand, there is Molly, the product of year's of less than ideal foster care, the rebel, the bright but untapped intellect.  On the other hand, there is Vivian, who left everything she knew in New York City when she was put aboard the orphan train for the west.  Both characters are strong and compelling.  I especially enjoyed the alternation of the two stories.<br /><br />However, I felt that the whole premise was a little too predictable.  In fact, there were a few scenes for Vivian's early experiences as an orphan which I was positive that I've read in other stories.  I don't want to give it away but it was a little bit of a let down.  Also, some other scenes were not very realistic.  No nine-year-old child would be able to walk four miles in a blizzard at night with no coat without some serious health risks.  Yes, she got pneumonia, but it's a wonder she made it at all with all her limbs and digits intact.  Minnesota winters are unforgiving.<br /><br />But, barring these few criticisms, I would definitely recommend the book. It is well-written, the dialogue flows, and the characters are well-drawn.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|my 4 year old loves this game, I thought it might be to complicated but she figured it out pretty quick. only downside is it occasionally doesn't want to open and I have to go out to the app store again to pull it up.
B004EJUMT2|5.0|I first heard Ghost when I saw them in Atlanta when they opened for Mastodon and Opeth. The album is great, makes me think of 80s rock/pop, but satanic themed.
B007ZI06FE|4.0|This was a fun paranormal steampunk adventure. While not overly deep it had a really solid plot and interesting characters.<br /><br />As the first book in the series, it was a good start toward world building. I thought it featured an interesting take of vampire/were lore. The author did a really good job of setting up of the nature of this world without allowing the plot to be distracted by monkey-button details. I would have liked her to have gone deeper, but I suspect more will unfold through the rest of the series.<br /><br />I found both of the lead characters to be engaging. Honor was a good blend of strength and vulnerability and I do so enjoy a flawed hero. McMaster also cast some interesting secondary characters. It will be interesting to see how they develop, especially within the context of the political intrigue set in motion.<br /><br />What this book lacked in depth I think it made up for in entertainment value. It left me wanting more, but in a good way.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It's was my first Nicholas Sparks book.  I read it because I thought I may go see the movie. The book was good, don't think I want to see the movie.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|&#34;Would see this movie again, started out kinda slow but got better and better.<br />Must see and see again, yes.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great series. Couldn't put down. This last book was the best.<br />Good book for book club discussions. This book was ON FIRE!
B003VANOFY|1.0|These headphones have a great look and feel to them.  But, they don't work with Windows 7 x64 machines very well.  No matter the music source frequent popping, hissing and crackling sounds can be heard.  This is apparently a huge problem which Logitech has done nothing to fix but blame the user.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Enjoyed this book from start to finish.  Perfect combination of sex and romance.  The surprise ending left you wondering what will happen next. Look forward to reading the last book in the trilogy.
1563898586|5.0|Fantastic book, well worth my money. The plot, the characters, and the writing are all great. Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill's LOEG is a book I will definitely reread. Also, don't base your opinion on the movie if you've seen it, the book is by far superior.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|While I haven't had a chance to play this game more than a couple of times do find it fun and challenging.
B005LAIGW8|2.0|TThis did not meet up to the expactations of the first movie alto cage did a decent job of acting. as i like 90 percent of his movies the story line an script  was lacking
B004XDYJRU|3.0|I finally got the app to update and then received a decoder error. I uninstalled and then  reinstalled and the older version still works great. So try and uninstall and reinstall if app isn't working , it worked for me. I hope this might help someone. This is a great app when working and the main music app that we use , hopefully they will get the update working and it will be even better.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I can't even fully describe in words how I feel about  this book.  It was completely heartbreaking and I loved every word.  I could not put  it down.  I inhaled it like a taco (I love tacos, damnit).  It's just so delicately written and has the strongest emotion of any book I can think of at this moment.  I laughed with Sky, I cried with Sky.  About halfway through the book, I realized just  the extent of how amazing this book is enough that  I gifted a copy to my best friend.<br /><br />I definitely think this is a book that should be read by everyone.  Not just romance lovers!  I know some people feel a stigma about romance novels being smut, but this book was nothing short of a breath taking piece of literary art.
B006P0WMBO|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised after downloading this game to my Kindle to find that it works just like the game I play on my laptop.  Lots of fun but wish there were more options for upgrades.  Once you reach the end of the line get the feeling:  &#34;is that all there is?&#34;.
B000FGGE68|3.0|I think this is better than the Resident Evil movies or any of the the sequels Milla is a good scifi actress
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book kept me interested from start to finish. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a great story!
1455527475|3.0|Investing with those sharks is not for the average Joe and the author didn't make that fact emphatic enough. He could have been more graphic and forceful.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|The movie kept my attention but ... it was n-o-t up to the Golden Globe and Academy Award hype. Good try tho'.

B0095P31L6|5.0|Rango is one of those animated films that stands on its own -- it's appealing to kids and grown-ups, and not just because of the awesome animation. The story has plenty of humor, but also suspense, pathos, a little bit of a message . . . and terrfic memorable characters.  If I could change anything, I'd ask for more of the mariachi owl band in the later part of the movie -- they're a hoot!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved trying to guess what was happening all through the book - I was mostly wrong and the ending...OMG.  TWISTED

0062014536|4.0|I had a hard time deciding what rating to give Requiem and finally decided on 3.5, rounding up to 4 stars.<br /><br />I'm having a hard time formulating my thoughts on Requiem, the final book in the Delirium trilogy. On one hand, I absolutely love this series. I love what it represents, I love the story, the ideas, the characters. I devoured Requiem, wanting to know where this trilogy would end, and was sad that it just didn't live up to the pedestal I put it on.<br /><br />I loved the alternating perspectives in the final book, just like I did with Pandemonium. It gave me as a reader a great glimpse inside the two worlds- Hana's and Lena's. We see that what should be the perfect life, Hana is still struggling with the cards she has been dealt. And Lena, is stuck between her rock and a hard place love triangle- she's got Julian but also Alex who has found his way back to her at the end of Pandemonium. I loved the two interweaving stories, showing me the full picture of what's really going on.<br /><br />I know I'm not the only one disappointed with the ending, which seemed abrupt and non-fulfilling. But I'm also frustrated with the events leading up to the ending. Some parts came off as very rushed, or scenes that weren't quite complete enough. Without giving out spoilers, I absolutely loved Hana's chapters, especially the ones where she plays detective to reveal parts of her life that aren't as perfect as it seems. But again, this was something I wanted to see developed more.<br /><br />Overall, this was a good ending to the trilogy, but left me wanting more.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|I both hated and loved the ending of Pandemonium. I loved the fact that we got to see what we had all been hoping would happen since the end of delirium but I hated how it all played out. I hated that it ended so abruptly. I wanted to throw my book across the room and shoot out “Noooooo! How could you Lauren Oliver!? How could you leave the ending on that horrible cliffhanger?”<br />But of course, I didn't, always truthfully, I really really wanted to.<br /><br />So it was with great excitement and trepidation that I went into reading Requiem. Not only did we have that crazy cliffhanger to deal with but we also have the ending of a trilogy that I have come to absolutely love. To saying goodbye to characters that have been nothing short of becoming friends as I have journeyed with them over the course of the series. To care about and love. So to say I was also sad while starting this, would be an understatement.<br /><br />I love how much Lena has grown throughout this series. She is so strong and capable now. She still gets confused and scared but she never lets it control her. She still pushed on and forges ahead. She is brave and truly someone to be proud of.<br /><br />I am so glad that she finally got moments with her mom. I don't want to say too much because I don't want any spoilers but, I am happy with what Ms. Oliver gave us.<br /><br />Hana. Oh Hana, how I disliked thee after reading your novella. She did redeem herself though, I will say that much and I found myself liking her once again.<br /><br />So much happens in this and yet so much doesn't. I really feel it is hard to write this review without giving anything away. Alex, Julian, the resistance, the fighting, the dying, the heartache, the resolve. Gah! How can I say all that I want to without spoilers?<br /><br />I will say that the ending, while it was a definite ending, which okay, was a little disappointing and left me feeling a little bit sad, it did give me hope too. It is one of those ending where really the possibilities are limitless. Anything could happen because you can make that ending yourself. You can choose to believe whatever you want to believe.<br /><br />Am I disappointed that there wasn't a set in stone ending? That Lauren didn't spell it all out for us? If I am being honest, yes. Yes I am a little disappointed but I understand why she left it the way she did and I am okay with that, I really am.<br /><br />The author has done such a great job with the whole trilogy that it is hard to be too upset with her that she didn't give me the exact ending I wanted, after all, this wasn't my series, my dream or my creation. This was hers and she could end it however she wanted to.<br /><br />She did give the characters redeeming qualities for past wrongs and mistakes. She did make me love and care for them even more after it was all said and done. And she did make me mourn for the loss of those that died and the loss of the series as a whole so in part, she did her job. She brought out emotions in me only a good writer can.<br /><br />So am I angry it ended the way it did? So open to interpretation that it was? Nope. Not at all. In fact, well done Ms. Oliver. Well doneg where really the possibilities are limitless. Anything could happen because you can make that ending yourself.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover's &#34;first&#34;, was written as though this is the only genre, New Adult or Young Adult, she has ever known. There is subject matter that is commonly disturbing and also, I believe, commonly beautiful. There are graphic scenes described so magnificently that, but for the lack of &#34;mature language&#34;, the reader feels what's happening just as strongly as the characters must. The psychological development of our two main characters, Sky and Holder,  is absolutely at an adult level.The emotional upheaval, while heart-wrenching and absolutely tear-inducing is so completely worth the read.

1439152802|5.0|'The Secret Keeper' is a well-written, page-turning novel. I found it hard to put down. Even though I predicted the ending early on, it was exciting to keep reading to see if I was right. The author is skilled at gradually building up tension until the reader is beyond him/herself with anticipation. The characters are vivid and relatable; the prose fluid and smooth. It is a rare book that keeps the reader in suspense until the very last page. Loved this novel!

0679405496|5.0|While E.M. Forster's \\"A Passage to India\\" will always be discussed for its cultural and political aspects, one cannot help but admire the extraordinary writing. In his latest book, \\"How to Write a Sentence\\", Stanley Fish keys in on the final sentence of \\"A Passage to India\\" where Aziz and Fielding ponder the possibility of friendship and reconciliation between them and between their worlds:<br /><br />\\"But the horses didn't want it - they swerved apart; the earth didn't want it, sending up rocks through which riders must pass single file; the temples, the tank, the jail, the palace, the birds, the carrion, the Guest House, that came into view as they issued from the gap and saw Mau beneath: they didn't want it, they said in their hundred voices, 'No, not yet,' and the sky said, 'No, not there.' \\"<br /><br />I have to agree with Fish that the sentence is just remarkable--animate and inanimate objects conspire to bar the \\"connect\\", the relationship. But I would also argue that so much of the book, so many passages [NPI] merit<br />admiration. Throughout the novel, Forster exhibits the command of George Orwell and the foreboding of Joseph Conrad:<br /><br />\\"She had come to that state where the horror of the universe and its smallness are both visible at the same time--the twilight of the double vision in which so many elderly people are involved. If this world is not to our taste, well, at all events, there is Heaven, Hell, Annihilation--one or other of those large things, that huge scenic background of stars, fires, blue or black air. All heroic endeavour, and all that is known as art, assumes that there is such a background, just as all practical endeavour, when the world is to our taste, assumes that the world is all. But in the twilight of the double vision, a spiritual muddledom is set up for which no high-sounding words can be found; we can neither act nor refrain from action, we can neither ignore nor respect Infinity.\\"<br /><br />There are witty lines that pepper the novel, as well, such as \\"Adventures do occur, but not punctually\\" and \\"Life never gives us what we want at the moment that we consider appropriate.\\" This is a wonderful novel that demands our admiration and respect. It is a work that reminds of what a writer at the height of his craft can do.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|If you think your adventure is done after this book. Never have you been so wrong. I highly suggest watching the HBO adaptation after the read if you can contain yourself. Enjoy a great adventure. Dark wings. Enjoy!
B007EECSFA|4.0|Enjoyed this book and it had an ending that surprised  me. Brought World War 11 to life and especially the Blitz.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|The book is slow to start and hard to comprehend that someone would walk this far to see someone they aren't really close too, but as you get into the book you understand the main characters quest. There are a few twists and turns towards the end of the book that I didn't see coming. I enjoyed the book.
B00122MWBK|5.0|The Goo Goo Dolls were so consistent in making great songs. Hits or sleepers, they're all good. I listen to this all the time in my car.
B008J2GAKU|5.0|I might as well legally change my name to Batman and be done with it. If this doesn't make you want to be a detective again (like you once wanted to be when you were younger, or want to be right now!) there are issues you need to have worked out. Join the Caped Crusader in an amazing new caper. . .See what i did there! Enjoy!
030758836X|2.0|I got about half way through this book and bailed - now I feel as if I shed a 500 pound weight off my back. Some sick characters making terrible decisions and dragging the reader through the depressing consequences and their surreal rationalizations. I can't understand how the author could keep these characters in her head for months without going crazy herself. Soap Opera addicts might love this book but I sure didn't.
B007VPLNGW|4.0|My kids LOVE this game!  They are 7 + 4 years old.  This game is similar to angry birds.  It is wonderful to watch my 4 year old guy try to figure out how the shark can get all the ducks.  I thought this would be too difficult for him, but he loves the sharks and sticks with it.  He has only asked for help a few times, and when he plays I can see his mind working on the problem!
B006LSZECO|1.0|worst ending of a book. I have never left a review befor but was so disapointed in the ending of this book I felt like I should
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Keep reading, there's an abundance of lore and fantasy awaiting. I cannot wait to complete my journey and await the next book. Forward to a Song of Storms! For Winterfell!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book!!! It is truly addicting and excellent from page one. I loved the story telling, the realness, and the characters. Buy this book!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My 7 year old and 4 year old love this game.  It is somewhat addictive for the first few days.  Even I enjoyed helping them get the coins and jump all the barriers and trains.  It is fast paced and fun.  It is not an educational game.  Although, I have noticed my daughter saving her coins to 'purchase' different upgrades, characters or skateboards.  My 4 year old is not great at saving yet!  The are options for in app purchases, but they are not annoying and in your face like other games we have tried.  I will say that some of the characters cost a LOT of 'money'.  My kids are too young to play the game long enough to amass the fortune it would take to buy those characters/boards.  But there are a few things they can buy with their earnings.  :)
B009JZWO3I|1.0|This show has gone from bad to worse. Characters disappear and are never heard from again. The acting is bad though I do like Elsbeth's character. She is a ray of sunshine in a show that otherwise is very foggy.
0307237702|5.0|When I read this I decided I must vote for this man. he gave<br />me the first hope I had in several decades. I committed myself<br />to his election.
B005UD1D62|3.0|Its a good read for when you're tired and just need something light and easy to read.  If you like Lauren Conrad and drama then you'll enjoy her books.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|AWESOME, Brilliant, LOVE LOVE LOVE IT, I look forward to everyweek and wait until I get it on Amazon. GREATEST SHOW EVER
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Dialogue is witty, characters are instant heroes. I normally read thrillers, this was fast paced and had a lot of punches without being sappy.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Really enjoyed this book, not exactly what I expected from the story but probably even more believable than what I'd hoped for.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is addicting and fun loved it lots . Of good items to buy and cool characters thank you kiloo
B0007MWZEK|5.0|purchased to replace an older model that was missing some parts<br />lightweight and works great<br />would recommend to anyone for light cleaning
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Read it the week of his death - heart wrenching. You feel blessed that the USA has people like Chris. I made a donation to his charitable foundation.
B003VWC4AS|5.0|Truly a Cinderella story from start to finish. Not only for the rugby players but for Mandela as well. Both Freeman and Damon are to be commended for their portrayals. A seemingly insurmountable task, that of the eradication of Apartheid, and a Rugby World Cup victory over the &#34;Haka&#34; crazed All Blacks play out before you. This film, inspired by true events, shows what can happen when people work together for the good of everyone. A must see for everyone young and old alike.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I like this book for many different reasons it was fun read.  I would of like some more details on what happened after they got togather at the end of the book.
B000001FK3|5.0|This guy does not disapoint, everything I've heard from this guy is very cool stuff !!! you gotta' give it a try.
B005NNV044|3.0|The breaks in the album were rough in the original album song flowed to song. balh blah blah etc etc
B00A2V2OVK|4.0|the beginning of this series is a great setup for fantastic television.  interesting characters and wonderful science fiction fantasy. love it!!
B005LAIGIM|5.0|Enjoyed every minute of this movie, being a movie buff, I enjoyed the comedy, laughs, and very interesting movie. You will love it.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|I'm not sure how long these guys have been around but being a lover of Southern Blues, I love it !!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book started out like the typical love story that would have been a boring read if it didn't take the twist that it did. After the unexpected twist everything in a way seemed a bit obvious, though the trip to the obvious responses were well worth the read. Then the ending had one final twist that was unexpected and made reading the whole book worth it and made the happy ending not your typical \\"happy ending\\" that sometimes has you thinking 'that would never happen in real life', but a real happy ending where people took the anguish and hardship and turned it to something good and real.
0345357116|5.0|For those who want to know more about Middle Earth than they can get from a Peter Jackson movie, I highly recommend this book. It provides a very in depth account of the history, people, and legends of middle earth.  After reading this, I enjoyed the movies and J.R.R. Tolkien's more well-known books much more.
B001EBWING|5.0|Recently watched this with a date who had never seen it.  I kept telling her she had seen it but that she just didn't realize it.  By the end of the movie she was amazed at how many lines she could quote even though she had never seen the movie.  This is an indispensable part of the education of any 21st century American, as the cultural background this movie affords gives context and meaning to so many quotes:<br /><br />&#34;here's looking at you kid&#34;<br />&#34;of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world...&#34;<br />&#34;I never plan that far in advance&#34;<br />&#34;how extravagant of you, throwing away women like that&#34;<br />&#34;I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship&#34;<br />&#34;play it for old time's sake Sam&#34;<br />&#34;are my eyes really brown?&#34;<br />&#34;round up the usual suspects&#34;<br />&#34;shocked! I'm shocked! to find gambling here!&#34;<br />&#34;you're right Umgadi, I am impressed&#34;
B009CPJHY4|3.0|Cute movie but slightly depressing about aging and how life slips away.  Of course, there are a few funny parts about aging.  If you like to think about getting old, then this is for you.  I will say that it wasn't the worst movie and there is a lesson at the end.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app it isn't as good as the PC version. Other than that best 7 dollars I ever spent! Can't wait until the pext update.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Relaxing music and play that doesn't require a genius IQ.  Still challenging....and tricky!  Addicting and satisfying.  Love it! You will, too!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Very awesome take on the whole Holmes and Watson relationship.  Can't wait for season 2.  Jonny lee miller is pretty dynamic as Watson and who doesn't love Lucy liu.
044654759X|5.0|Heartwarming love story that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The writer is wise beyond his years in describing feelings and interactions between all the characters.
