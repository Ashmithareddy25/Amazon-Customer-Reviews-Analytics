B008XG1X18|5.0|love this app. i have never had any problems with it and use it all the time on my kindle fire.
0525953728|5.0|I found it most interesting, and to read about the difficul training and the risk of their lives that the SEAL's go through, to Protect our country. They deserve all of the accolades that we can bestow upon them.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I lost saved games twice and can't be bothered to play this anymore. Its pretty cool on the kindle fire. But twice I entered a world and had my inventory, but all the edits I did were gone and the world looked like I've never touched anything. Quite irritating.. I would avoid this.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great if you need a calculator on hand. The buttons are a nice size also. I like to use it if using kindle and need a calculator.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Nice story, sad. I m  looking forward to reading last part. i can only hope for a happy ending. we‘ll see
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I like this game. simper to play. decent graphic. silly characters. I like that I don't have to share with facebook if I don't want to.
B009CPIR9K|5.0|This was not quite the story I was expecting. It was better!<br />Was very good with excellent FX and filming. As an Indy film it gets top marks from me.
B0091XRL86|5.0|This is a very funny and charming movie. Definitely one to consider purchasing for the whole family. Enjoyable and worth watching again!
B006LSZECO|1.0|Decent original premise,but changes his mind about the direction several times without cohesion. Unsatisfying, unbelievable and  unsympathetic characters--wanted them all dead.
B007TMON8M|5.0|Good intro for our 13 yr old twins & 11 yr old to strength and design.  Challenging even for adults.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|The best SF book ever written and thats saying something as I have been reading and collecting SF books for over 50 years... I just wish that his son Biran was half the writter that Frank was... Anyway I love the entire series.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game isn't ground breakinging in anyway but it keeps you busy and entertained for however long you need it to.
B0055B7IPE|4.0|I really like the instant rental option. (and it's decent prices). The movie showed in high quality and was fun to watch.
B008GFI4KY|3.0|I was really looking forward to this release.  There first two albums were very good and offered some great rock.  I gave a listen to this one twice.  By the second time around I had decided it just wasn't very good, and lacked any identity.  So, I quickly put it away in the CD rack.
B008I43DYU|5.0|Everything you would expect and a great layout! If your looking for a regular or advanced calc. this is the app for you!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Never a bad episode. I got hooked on the show, and SOA and Justified are the best shows on tv.
B007RI56NY|4.0|This album is a good buy. There is not single song that I don't enjoy, and 50 ways to say goodbye is great. I love the pop trumpet mix.
B0095R76EW|1.0|Doing anything else than watching this movie is better.  I do not understand the people that eat this stuff up and feel as if they recieved any type of entertainment from it. How do these actors get jobs???? Please, if you haven't seen this movie yet and are on the verge of purchasing it, please stop and pick up a book and read it instead.  Perhaps waiting for a bus and taking a ride on it just to waste time would be more enjoyable.
B008BM9L72|5.0|A good read.  Every book got better and better.<br />Was like a good meal:  Starter, Main & Pudding!<br />Well done!<br />Change your ingredients and set up a new meal.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I started reading the 1st book after reading \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\".  I love the characters Gideon and Eva.  Can't wait to read the third installment.  The ups and downs of their relationship kept me wanting more....
B005H9B44A|5.0|this movie was great and I would recommend any kids between the ages of 2 and 11 to watch it. Jennifer Lopez gets naked at the end. Bomb
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app stimulates the mind. I also love thus bonus tablet. addition. if you have a kindle fire and love a challenge. this is the game for you
B009KHDT0C|1.0|It's really that bad, not funny at all.  Just watch the trailer, its better then the entire movie... A witch and a vampire fighting over a cannery (fish, it just sounds fun right?)? Didn't know that was the plot line? How would you from the preview, but yup, that's it.
B003GK22HK|4.0|Very nice story, told in a competent style.<br />Makes you actually live in the 1920's, as well as inside the characters, be they a teenager eager to see the world, or a woman in her 90's.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I enjoyed the book cover to cover,very impressive how well prepared the men are for any task. One must stay focused,tenacious & goal orientedin order to pass the test to serve our country
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|When I downloaded the game I didn't realize what it was going to be. I laugh at people in the casinos that sit at this machine and now I am addicted to it on my Kindle Fire.
030758836X|5.0|I really yearn for creative writing that makes me shake my head and say, wow I didn't see that coming.  The characters are difficult, calculating and interesting in a way that makes you like them one moment and hate them the next.  I really loved the complicated nature of how they were developed over time.  This was not a predictible book and kept my interest throughout the entire book.  I liked it so much that I read the other two books Ms. Flynn wrote and cannot wait for the next.  Very interesting prose.  Ms. Flynn writes as if I was speaking it or thinking the same thoughts.  With the snarky comments making me laugh at times.  I really couldn't put this down!  Great read, great writing, great other books by her as well!
B004R13U6Y|4.0|I use the ezPDF Reader for the Kindle Fire, as an upgrade to the default PDF reader, which I found inadequate.<br /><br />ezPDF Reader is a quality product at a great price.  ezPDF displays PDFs much better and with many more undocumented menu options than the default reader.  The biggest issue I have with the product is the lack of a user guide.  I searched high and low for english language users guide to describe how to configure and use some of the advanced features only to come up empty.<br /><br />I'm not the kind of customer who enjoys finding the hidden nuggets by exploring different menus and touching different parts of the screen, I much prefer some sort of guide.  After spending about an hour \\"playing with icons and menu buttons\\" I've found settings I can live with, though probably missing some useful options.<br /><br />ezPDF is great for my use which is downloaded PDFs, mostly career related manuals.<br /><br />ezPDF might deserve 5 stars with a good users guide, or more exploration.<br /><br />I do recommend ezPDF for a Kindle Fire PDF reader for those who find the default reader lacking.
B0080N6AVC|5.0|Supernatural is that little show that showed it could, there are so few episodes threw out the entire series that leave me not happy.  As a whole its one of my favorite shows the the writing being very well done from season one right up to till now.  So if your looking for a good show with very few disappointments this i would highly recommend.
B004QZ9P6K|5.0|This book personifies the difference that can take shape when thinking is adjusted, governments 'get it' and the private sector recognizes the opportunities.<br /><br />Israel is surrounded by enemies, has almost no natural resources (other than education, people with a vision & a steely resolve)  and is taking in immigrants regularly. All are reasons to fail and disappear. Not in this amazing country where everything is about what can be done!<br /><br />Not only do they make lemonade from lemons, they make them into a gourmet meal!<br /><br />Read this book.
B0098VXBIA|3.0|Good stars.  Humor was good. It is better than a LOT of movies lately.  At least it wasn't excessive language.
0525953728|5.0|This is a very well written book that keeps you turning the pages until you get to the end. The reading format is excellent and the storyline perspective is both exciting and historical. Kudos to the author and our military, in this case especially our Navy SEALS, for what they go through to keep our nation safe.
B008XFAT7S|5.0|This movie kicked so much ass it wasn't even funny. The action scenes were unbelievable and the story line has a sufficient amount of character development as well as plot twists I didn't see coming. Would recommend to all my friends, maybe not my mother or young children.
B00846REIS|5.0|Awesome book! It kind of resembled 50 shades but not like everyone said. The storyline is definitely different and really hot!!
B0086QS7N2|5.0|Rush rocked with this album and their setlist for their tour was amazing as well.  Clockwork Angels, The Anarchist, The Wreckers, Headlong Flight and The Garden are all fantastic songs!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Don't hesitate to install this app, it is perfect!  The large numbers on the keys are great. And the &quot;cheat sheet&quot; displayed beneath the formula as you enter the numbers is a real quick way to ensure you hit what you wanted. Great app!
B0087HT36U|4.0|Fun game. Good graphics.  Passed all levels without too much difficulty and without buying extra bombs. Waiting for age of cowboys. Hopefully it will be ready soon.
0393327345|5.0|This is a story about diminished expectations for a whole generation of young American men.  Your hair will stand on end as this story unfolds.  You can fully understand the angst that drives these young men to such desperate measures.  They are trapped in a world that does not value them.  So, for them, the best defense against existence in a mundane world is a good offense.  Unfortunately, real world events have intervened since this book was written and terrorist activities of any kind (even presented as satire) are hard to justify.  This book is an adventure into actions that wind up going terribly wrong.  Please note how General Motors is now paying the price for recall issues that were not addressed, but were wryly alluded to in the story's prescient sub-plot.  So it is.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I read the book Gone Girl: A Novel recently.  I didn't like the way it kept switching from one to the other narratively.  The book did hold my interest but did NOT like the ending.  It was a huge letdown for me.
068485743X|4.0|Most writers are consumed with writing a story about unforgetable characters from a certain point of view.  This book reins in your orientation and makes it clear; if you don't write to get past the gates of hell (agents and publishers) you have no shot of getting your story published no matter how wonderful your characters or concept may be.  There are simple things that agents and publishers look for in order to weed out amateurs and make a dent in the pile of manuscripts they have to get through.  This is the reality of the publishing business.  If you learn what NOT to do in the first five pages they allot to reading your submission, you have a chance, because they assume that the rest of you story will reflect the skill that your first five pages demonstrates; so they read on.  If your story delivers the goods, you make it to serious consideration. Now, this may burst a few balloons concerning your hopes of a rewarding writing career; but best learn about it now instead of later.  You can do this.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|I've always loved Beetlejuice and it's no surprise I love this DVD! It's a classic and it even includes a few episodes of the cartoon version. It's AWESOME.
0316228532|2.0|During the first half of the book I took a lot of notes, more than normal.  I didn't know who was going to be important.  It turned out almost everyone was important, so I needed those notes.  There were nine households with parents and children to keep track of and additional characters as well.  By the middle of the book I was wondering when are things going to start getting good?  Later in the book I was impatient for it to be over.  The last thirty pages were the best, when interesting things happened to two characters.  One stood up against obstacles and made a difference.  One saw beneficial changes in her circumstances.  But for all the other characters, things just continued as before.  There were a few minor changes, but nothing that grabbed me.<br /><br />Most of the book, the first 475 pages, is about selfish, petty, lying, cheating, unpleasant people doing mean things to others.  Some of them are incompetent.  Some refuse to see the truth and cover it up.  Some physically or mentally abuse their children and spouse.  There was not a single good marriage in the bunch.  There was no one to root for (until the very end) when a tragedy happens to someone you care about.  A lot of people were being hurt.  It was not entertaining.<br /><br />The story is set in a village called Pagford which is run by a 16-member council.  One council member dies.  An election will be held to replace him.  We learn about the candidates.  The main political issue is The Fields, a low-income housing area located just outside of the village.  Some council members want to stop paying for social and other services.  Other members want to continue supporting The Fields.<br /><br />One of the stories is 16-year-old Krystal and her and 3-year-old-brother Robbie living with their drug-addict-mother Terri in The Fields.  It's depressing and tearful to see how they live and suffer.<br /><br />I think the author's purpose (at the end) was to have readers care about and do something to help those less fortunate, especially children who live in poverty.<br /><br />DATA:<br />Narrative mode: 3rd person.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is great. its not like other games where if u want to advance it costs money. you can do a lot with just playing the game. and the scratch take is addictive!!!!
B00973CGXK|5.0|When I first download the album I wanted to listen to the songs in order to get familiar with them.  By doing that though I found myself skipping songs.  For the first couple of listens I was disappointed.  The next day I decided to listen it again but didn't bother changing my mp3 player off of random play.  I as I listened I would look to see what song was playing because I liked it.  Much to my surprise it was a song I skipped the day before. That happened a couple of times.  Now after several listens with it on random play I love it! For me it seemed the order of the track listings wasn't good for the album but the songs mixed up are great! I can't stop listening to them.  I look forward to catching them live.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|This is a typical Jack Reacher story, however not THE best Jack Reacher story.  Way too \\"scenery descriptive\\" and not as much action as in previous books.  It has a lot of surprises that keeps you guessing.  I love Jack Reacher and Lee Child and will continue to purchase and read his books.
1401324649|3.0|The 100 year old man, a mixture of Woody Allen's Zelig and a teeny bit of Ignatius O'Reilly (a very teeny bit) is a brisk and easy but at times somewhat silly read.  Good airplane reading even if in the final few pages the overall theme is \\"and everyone lived happily ever after\\".
0880796863|4.0|This was my first deck and I liked it. However with a little more experience I realized the coloration on all the cards are off which isn't a huge deal but it would be nice to have the original colors. Besides this I feel the booklet it provides is not as informational as this website I found and have been using - (...)<br /><br />A good beginner deck I suppose but I truly wish to find a special deck of my own in the future and the messed up colors still kind of bothers me.
B001GMQALY|4.0|Very steamy, every one should do this once in your life. These two got a chance to have something we all want just don't know how to make work.  Take a lot of trust and I'm nowhere near there.
B0036EH3WU|3.0|I'm sure that if this review ever gets read it will rack up mostly \\"not helpful\\" judgments. Yes, the \\"not helpful\\" judgment that nine times out of ten really is a \\"I don't agree with you\\" judgment. But here goes....My wife and I watched Lost religiously from start to finish. At times, it seemed as if a good portion of our lives revolved around it -- discussing not only the story but storytelling technique and character realization and, well, all the fundamentals of that human monument called fiction. There were hooks galore, complications and connections that seemed so delicious, and The Big Mystery that lay there, covered by that metaphorical tarp that someday we just knew would be thrown aside to display the glorious fictional construct underneath, shining in all its glory. What a load of crap that turned out to be. My reaction parallels exactly that of another reviewer who chose to give this series only one-star. I give it three, because overall it's okay. It is a wonderful ride for most of the run. There are ups and downs, of course. The flashback stories became repetitive: Yet one more escape for Kate, another paternal betrayal of Locke, and so on. And as the layers peeled off, it seemed as if we weren't going deeper into the mystery, just sideways. In the end -- in that stupid, uninspired end -- we found out there wasn't anything at all under the tarp. No payoff, which is to my mind one of those fundamental elements of fiction. The creator and audience enter into a silent pact, an agreement that says I'll take some time from you, but the time will be spent on a wondrous journey that will leave you in a place you'll be glad you visited. Well, the journey was rather wondrous most of the time, but as the cliche goes, when we got to the end there was no there there. The producers never knew where they wanted to go; they just made it up on the fly, creating one stopgap after another, until time finally ran out. If enough time has elapsed so that you aren't particularly aware of the details of this series, you might still rent or check out from a library one season after another. Enjoy the trip, but be forewarned that it leads nowhere.
0143119680|4.0|When I first picked up this book to read it, I couldn't get in to it. So I put it aside, read other books, and then came back to it. I have to chalk up my first experience to exhaustion, or a short burst of insanity. The second time was the charm. I listened to this book on audio as well as read through it. If you like audio books I definitely would recommend this one. Jennifer Ikeda narrates and does a fantastic job. Very enjoyable.<br />The story itself is epic. It's full of vivid details and imagery that blew me away. There are quite a few supernatural characters in this book. Don't worry, keeping track of them doesn't get confusing. I love all their distinct personalities. The story sucks you in from the beginning. Mathew and Diana are mesmerizing characters. They have great chemistry together. I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happens between them. The story line is built around a missing manuscript.Diana has been doing research and retrieves a manuscript that has been missing for years and years. She puts the book back, but not before gathering the attention of some very powerful supernaturals.  All the supernaturals are waiting for Diana to retrieve the book from the library, including Matthew and her fellow witches and wizards. Diana is the only one who is not interested in retrieving the book. She's not sure if she can fully trust Matthew or understand why he's helping her. He's a vampire after all. And vampires and witches don't mix. However he might be her only chance to survive.  Diana discovers that there is a dark side to witchcraft. She's been running away from  her true self.  Diana must either embrace who she is, or continue on her current path of blindness unprepared for what lies ahead. There is so much intrigue it kept me reading late into the night. This book has it all: great characters, interesting story line, a bit a romance, and lots of mystery.You can tell the author did a lot of research for A Discovery of Witches, from thehistory to the geography. This is definitely a book I'd recommend to the paranormal lovers out there. I can't wait to delve into the second book, Shadow of Night.
B00005JLEU|5.0|To try and describe this movie is kind of crazy.  I mean there's this little girl in a world inhabited by strange and curious spirits who must rescue her parents from a frightening and terrible fate. But the journey is so much more than a simple description.<br /><br />The animation is just gorgeous, the story is captivating and unique, and the musical score is so haunting and beautiful, you will find yourself remembering the themes long after the movie is over. Please give it a chance and allow yourself to be swept away by this special little film.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|Steve Jobs was a very complex, intelligent, and antisocial person.  I enjoyed learning about the path he took getting to the development of the Apple product.  As a Microsoft user, the path that Jobs took for Apple now makes a lot more sense.  I work in the high tech industry and hearing about the the Palo Alto area also lended interest to me.  Jobs' quirks lent credence to my belief that true geniuses don't often times have common sense.  He is truely a unique person.  Jacobson did a good job of interviewing many people that participated in the sphere of his life.  I would have liked to know a little more about his family but the book was very long to begin with.  I also think that Jobs was not with his family most of the time.<br /><br />Excellent reading for anyone wanting to know about a true innovator.

B0085RZFM8|5.0|What is amazing about Fitzgerald is that he wrote about a minuscule slice of American life, and managed, in the process, to capture the essence of the whole thing. The substance of The Beautiful and Damned is essentially trivial, and yet the novel is transcendentally moving. Anthony and Gloria Patch are hardly sympathetic personages, but by the time the novel reaches its climax, you care about them, you want them to win. They persevere in their dissolution and are rewarded by an after-the-fact imprimatur. You feel that, like Fitzgerald, they will not see old age, but they've got what they want now, which is what counts. The language, of course, is (no other term will do) beautiful. Dwarfed in the public regard by Gatsby, this is a book any student of or lover of our literature must know. Besides, the story moves; it is a great read.
B008Y1RTUG|4.0|Having seen several attempts to make the animated classic into a movie, I wasn't expecting much more than to enjoy the performances of the actors.  Happily, I found much to enjoy with this movie.  It is by far one of, if not the best version of Snow White I've seen.  The story was humanized in such a way as to give a good twist on the classic telling.  The characters displayed depth and complexity, and I was drawn in emotionally when I was not expecting to be.  This is a really good movie for the romantic at heart, because you will get a good story with great acting from Ms. Theron, Chris Hemsworth, and yes, even Kristen Stewart. Plus, there are good CGI effects, and plenty of fight scenes for the \\"not so romantic\\" at heart.<br /><br />The four star rating I gave it is based on my own personal taste and nothing really against the movie itself.  I prefer movies that focus more on the characters, while I understand that with Snow White there is a built in restriction by having to tell the story itself.  I was definitely left feeling that more could have been done to develop some of the characters' points of view, but it did not stop me from enjoying the movie very much.  I'm very happy to have purchased the digital copy, because I've watched it twice already!
B006LSZECO|5.0|The book started off slow with not much going on, except information that made the book a better read towards the middle to the very end. Gone Girl is a book that is hard to put down.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|with no glossing over the rough edges of adapting to change when you are older.  I was impressed at how successfully the movie avoided being a stereotype about \\"old people; aren't they cute, funny, dumb, etc.\\".  This is a stellar cast, doing what they do best, making you care about them.  There are sticky social issues addressed within the movie, which I didn't expect, but were played to perfection by Maggie Smith and Tom Wilkinson.  Judi Dench and Bill Nighy were fantastic, along with the other supporting cast.  Now I am in that \\"older\\" age range, so I may have some subconcious bias.  I thought it was a very entertaining and in a way, uplifting, movie.  The premise of bringing strangers together in a place that is new to them has been done to death, but this movie focused more on the people themselves than the surroundings.  They develped the characters well and with this ensemble cast, it was an interesting, engaging movie for me.<br /><br />There are no special effects, fight scenes, or explosions, other than the emotional ones between two people.  If you enjoy reading a good story or book on a weekend afternoon, this movie will make a nice substitute.  Younger people interested in literature will probably also enjoy it, but if your family are more entertained by the big event type movies, just rent it for yourself.

B007GCY8FS|3.0|Lee Childs is, no doubt, a wonderful writer and has one of the best characters in Jack Reacher. But, we don't need to know more about Jack and how his mind works - we fans know Jack already. What we need is for Jack to be Jack and start kicking some ass. Yes, mystery is great and we need a great story. I have no doubt about Lee Child's ability to deliver a story. But Lee - you need to exercise Jack's brawn too. That's what I fell in love with - just as much as his unique mental skills. Come on Lee - DELIVER !!!!

0802473156|5.0|The book takes a a little while to explore the 5r Love Languages, which we all have at least one primary one; 1) Acts of Service, 2) Words of Affirmation, 3) Quality Time, 4) Gift Giving, 5) Physical Touch and Closeness, but is an entertaining read. The message though, is amazing.<br /><br />As an example; I thought my wife's love language was Acts of Service so I would constantly be up and doing stuff around the house for her. Sure she appreciated that, but what she wanted first was quality time over coffee, etc. Just learning what speaks to each other the most is extremely effective in improving the marriage relationship.<br /><br />There is no weird \\"psycho babble\\" here. I strongly recommend this book.

So this is a book that you would purchase to give to that guy who could really benefit but would probably not care for the original cover, etc.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|Really fascinating, insightful book about this towering figure in the world of high stakes business and technology.  So interesting to follow Steve Jobs through his successes and failures to finally evolve to where he got to in his life.<br />Equally fascinating, was the dark side of his character and the scorching way he felt he needed to treat people around him.<br />In any case, this book was masterfully written and was a real page turner for me - I couldn't put it down.

B0009A40ES|3.0|&#34;American Psycho&#34; (2000) didn't look like a promising film for me. On the surface, the plot is essentially the reverse of &#34;Deathwish.&#34; In &#34;Deathwish&#34; a respectable citizen in New York City forsakes the law to secretly kill criminal scumbags in the name of justice; in &#34;American Psycho&#34; a scumbag in New York City masquerades as a respectable citizen while secretly murdering innocent people.<br /><br />I didn't think I'd like this film because the main character is, well, an American psycho (Christian Bale), which means it's impossible to care about him or root for him. In fact, pretty much the only people in the film that you might care about or root for are the psycho's secretary, Jean, and the detective (Willem Dafoe).<br /><br />So the film starts off with a strike against it, but then I found myself getting into the story, meaning I was entertained, and that's the name of the game in cinema.<br /><br />I also got the joke. &#34;American Psycho&#34; is not a serious horror movie or drama; it's a black comedy or satire. As such, it's impossible to take seriously and be scared; and there are quite a few amusing or laugh-out-loud scenes (like the head in the fridge).<br /><br />Thankfully, &#34;American Psycho&#34; has meaning beyond the surface. It's a commentary on the emptiness of America's materialistic, irreligious modern culture. Our innate moral compass has been lost with the passing of spiritual faith as we desperately search for meaning in secularism, materialism, pompous titles and the outward images of success, which generally leaves us looking good, but spiritually bereft. Life becomes virtually meaningless beyond the mechanics of the grind and everything that goes into it. People become mere objects to compete with or fulfill selfish desires. Etcetera. ***SPOILER ALERT*** And then the final act strongly hints that none of the murders are real; it's all in his mind and he's going deeper into insanity.***END SPOILER***<br /><br />I don't know if it's because of Bale's subsequent fame as the Batman or what, but &#34;American Psycho&#34; has become a popular cult film since its poor performance at the box office in 2000.<br /><br />This is a hard R-rated film, so stay away if you're not in the mood for heaps of violence, gore, nudity, sex and cussing.<br /><br />GRADE: B- or C+br />I don't know if it's because of Bale's subsequent fame as the Batman or what, but &#34;American Psycho&#34; has become a popular cult film since its poor performance at the box office in 2000.<br /><br />This is a hard R-rated film, so stay away if you're not in the mood for heaps of violence, gore, nudity, sex and cussing.<br /><br />GRADE: B- or C+

B001GXF2YY|3.0|I have read a number of the Harry Bosch novels and have to say that this was bland. The threat of another LA riot over the brutal death of a prominent lawyer is constantly looming in the background. Bosch and his two partners have unearthed plenty of evidence, but some disappears. The only way to appease the public and not cause another riot is to sacrifice a white police officer. However, when Bosch's friend commits \\"suicide,\\" he does not bring justice for him or his family. He is too busy with his home life and kicking his smoking habit that he forgets his motto that \\"everyone counts.\\" I enjoyed reading the novel, but it was not up to par.<br />I bought this as a kindle edition and it's hard to believe that it was 474 pages. Only 84 percent was the book; the rest was promos for other works.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|from watching cello wars about year ago to this cd. Their music just keeps getting better and better. this cd has my three favorite songs ( peponi, secrets and how beautiful you are) thats i have been waiting months for i am a very proud owner of this cd. those thingink about this group, all i have to say is get it. with the nice range of music ( modern to classic) they give a plessent twist to song making them unforgitable.
B009B2VBWE|2.0|I love T-Bone Burnett and I love Diana Krall, but this cd is like combining steak and ice cream. Some things just can't be fused. The worst part of the album is that the pacing puts me to sleep and the arrangements are so self conscious that they actually annoy me into pushing the forward button. It's a disappointment on several levels. Even the material is weak.
B00846REIS|4.0|The beginning of Bared to You was very familiar to 50 Shades but I was determined to continue reading. Once the story set the foundation, the story line changed. I went on to read the new released sequel and was not disappointed.

B000002GJH|5.0|Whether it be a person who is rediscovering grunge era music, or simply is looking for a great soulful album in which you can listen from cover to cover.  Temple of the Dog has to be one of the most under rated albums of its generation.  Though it has always enjoyed being listed by many of as a masterpiece, the bands lacked continuos touring and the constant pushing out of videos to ever reach true mainstream popularity.  The band was never suppose to be anything more than a happy accident due from a sad event.  While this could be deemed a super group, Temple of the Dog is a tribute to fallen mother love bone singer due to a tragic over dose.  Though not every song is directly about Love Bone singer Andrew Wood, you do get a real sense that the band is dealing with personal demons they are forced to come to terms.  The morality check brought forth seems to called forth alot of questions, and thoughts. Am I a good man? Can I be better.  Here is to whom I love and yet have wronged.  Sound Garden lead vocals Chris Cornell a friend of late Andrew Wood gave himself to the product and wrote a huge portion of the music and lyrics.  Songs like Call me a dog bares the stamp of an apology to than wife Susan Silver.  The album examines love, pain and revelations from  a set of musician who were maturing right in front of their recording studio mics.  Often the songs would take off having the result of a perfect on stage jam season.  Almost like when playing they had their friend aside them and how they longed for the song to never end in fear if when they did something great would be again lost.  Something perfectly organic lives with in these songs.  Something every band dreams of doing while in the studio, something that have proven time and time again  can never be plan or expected.  Something when forced is never what it could be.  This band so accidently creates perfection.  Something they did not for money or fame, but out of love and respect to preserve the memory of a friend.  Get on Youtube or any other site in which you can find these songs to sample.  There is more to this album than just Hunger strike.  Cover to cover this album sings deep into your soul.  This is a great secret in many music collections, let it be in yours.friend.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I am so in love with this series!!!!  I liked this book better than \\"Bared to You\\" and I really liked that book too.  This story got more into the relationship of Gideon and Eva and showed how they can still love each other through all the ups and downs that life brings them.  I can't wait for the next book!!!!!
B004HW7JMY|5.0|I love the box which is not just your typical plastic blue box, it's kind of like a hard top book but with discs inside instead of pages. Great design, and plus being probably one of the best series ever, the price you pay for it is WELL WORTH IT, and I even paid for international shipping fees, still it was a GREAT PRICE.<br /><br />The only negative thing I would say, and this is for INTERNATIONAL ONLY, is that it took about a month or more for the product to arrive in my house, and I live in Mexico, which is next to USA. But anyway, it was worth the wait, so if your not desperate to have it and are OK with waiting that much time, DEFINITELY BUY IT!!

Neither characters appeal to me, and if I was going to read another line where Ana says \\"he is so attractive\\", I will vomit my brains out. I never written reviews before but this book got me so frustrated that I had to write something!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have been waiting for book 2 of the trilogy for about 2 years (seems longer), but it was worth the wait!  It would be best, but not essential, to read book 1 first.  The only problem with jumping into book 2 first is that you'll want to then read book 1.  My only disappointment is the wait for book 3.<br /><br />I enjoy reading history, but Ken Follet's historical fiction puts people like you and me in the mix of giants during heroic times.  I feel like I know each of the characters and families personally.<br /><br />I'd recommend this trilogy to anyone!
B005CMSDKA|4.0|The plot is cogent and a bit predictable.  What stands out is the lack of special effects and the energetic editing.  It's all done in the camera and in the cuts.  The throwback qualities of the visual would not be so obvious if it weren't for the Kraftwerk/Tangerine Dream style soundtrack, which sounds like 1982.<br /><br />Really cool filmmaking.  Not impressively deep but exceptionally well executed and very kinetic.  May become something of a cult classic due to certain mind-bending sequences which establish the film as the work of a director functioning as an auteur.  It has a distinct and European visual language than we see in most action-oriented films these days, echoing classic films from the 1970s .  Look up \\"auteur theory\\" if unfamiliar with the terminology of film criticism.
1594744769|3.0|This book has an excellent beginning! I loved the writing style of the author and felt it easy to read, comfortable and casual. The book, however for me, took a turn I had a hard time following. Although the book started off great and mysterious, the whole business with monsters and wights seemed silly and underdeveloped. I must say, though, the photography was wonderful! I had a great time examining each photo that was described and imagining what life might have been like with these people. Something I've also noticed, as far as the book's physical aspects are, as opposed to it's contents, is that the paper is wonderfully smooth and has a great contrast and thickness to it. I never really gushed over a book's visual and physical aesthetics, but this book was excellent in that category. The book's a quick read (especially with all the photos) so if you're looking for something weird casual read, then by all means pick this up!<br /><br />First Line: \\"I had just come to accept that my life would be ordinary when extraordinary things began to happen.\\" (8)<br /><br />Last Line: \\"We rowed faster.\\" (348)<br />-----------<br /><br />Quotes<br /><br />\\"We cling to our fairy tales until the price for believing them becomes too high...\\" (16)<br /><br />\\"Part of me felt like something momentous was about to happen. The other part of me expected to wake up at any moment, to come out of this fever dream or stress episode or whatever it was and wake up with my face in a puddle of drool on the Smart Aid break room table and think, Well, that was strange, and then return to the boring old business of being me.\\" (139)<br /><br />\\"They were gods of this strange little heaven, and I was their guest.\\" (180)

0316228532|5.0|J.K. Rowling is a true wordsmith.  This book can be read simply for the joy of experiencing how she puts sentences together.  The story is full of insights into the inner workings and self absorption of characters forced by the nature of their birth into society to behave in predictable ways.  It is sociology and psychological insight at its best.  The critics probably scanned the book and found something \\"ordinary\\" in an \\"ordinary\\" town in a short time span.  Nothing blows up, no death eaters, so they are dissapointed.  I could not put this book down.  I found myself laughing and marveling at some of the ways the language can be used, by the self-importance of the characters.  There is someone you know in this book, someone from your town.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book but I am a student of human nature and excellent writing.  Just a wonderful book.  Can't wait for more, J.K.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|Although I am a fan of Johnny Depp and Tim Burton, I was none too eager to see their versions of Barnaby Collins and DARK SHADOWS. I even hesitated to get the DVD just thinking it would be a campy version of TV cult classic. Oddly enough, even though it was campy, it worked. Depp give us his interpretation of Barnaby Collins as only Johnny Depp can, yet, he does not go over the top as one would expect with this material. Even Tim Burton seems to be toned down from his normal style.<br />We actually have an interesting vampire story with a full background. Barnabas Collins has a tragic background that led to him being cursed forever as a vampire. Two centuries have passed and Barnabas has show up at his family estate. I enjoyed the backstory of where he has been for two centuries and the current situation of his relatives. It's a funny idea thinking one of your ancestors who happens to be a vampire shows up at your home one day.<br />Barnabas promises not to harm any of his relatives and he is allowed to stay if he promises to help the family business thrive again.<br />I was floored by Tim Burton's DARK SHADOWS. It's a fun movie with just the right amount of camp to make it entertaining. Lovely Michelle Pfeiffer shows her best as the current Collins matriach trying to hold a crumbling family and empire together.<br />Helena Bonham Carter has a slow start as the resident psychiatrist for Pfeiffer's nephew, who doesn't seem so emotionally wounded as to need a full tim psychiatrist. Carter's character seems to be a throw away at first. Flamboyant and wild, her character doesn't deserve any respect from the family that has hired her, yet things changes after she knows Barnaby's secret.<br />Poor Barnaby doesn't want to be a vampire. He just wants to be mortal. It's not his fault that he is a vampire and it sure is not his fault that several innocent locals have to give their lives to feed his hunger for blood. Here is the only dark part of the film.<br />The Collins family has been cursed by a witch and imagine the power of a witch and a vampire \\"getting it on.\\"<br />Truly funny scene. The story is set in 1972 and the 1970's music is just right one. And who would expect Alice Cooper to be in a Tim Burton film, yet who better to be in a Tim Burton film than Alice Cooper?? Barnaby Collins tries to get with the times and hires that Alice Cooper \\"woman\\" to perform at a \\"ball.\\" Who throws a ball in 1972 anyhow? The delightful part of the film is the confusion of two eras and the fun of someone being out of place ina  new time. If you missed Alice Cooper in the 70's, here is your chance to see him perform now. Even though 40 years has passed, they seem to be able to wipe away those years when looking at Alice.<br /> It's so much fun to watch this film if you need some fun campy entertainment!

B008EZVNO0|3.0|I love Van Morrison, I have seen him perform at various times over the years, got all the records including this one.<br /><br />Nothing different about this one. The consummate professional at work. No surprises here. Great voice, articulation, delivery and you can hear most of the words.<br /><br />Great band, professionals, no fluffed notes.<br /><br />Lyrics, slightly bitter at best, good.<br /><br />OK.<br /><br />Same high quality well produced utterly good Van album. As always.<br /><br />That is the problem. I have listened to this and listened to this and this is all I can feel about it.<br /><br />Same guru, same method, same teacher.<br /><br />I would love to hear Van Morrison do a Wings. Get some friends, transit van, go around some pubs in Ireland and earn your keep and record it live no overdubs, no nothing.<br /><br />It will probably still be perfect but he would have to break a sweat to do it.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I needed to collect data from some industrial equipment using an RS232 port.  Seeing as how computers no longer come with these interfaces, I had to find an adapter to support this.  I bought the product on the basis of price and the existing reviews and I was not disappointed!<br /><br />I plugged it in, and voila, my computer had a new COM3 port.  Now, I needed to emulate the equipment that I described above, so I bought two of these babies.  Plugging in the second one gave me a COM4 port.  I was able to immediately connect the two together (with a 9 pin null modem cable) and start communicating.  The comm software that I downloaded was able to control the baud rate, parity and handshaking with no difficulty whatsoever.<br /><br />Totally recommended.

0385344333|1.0|Much as I don't want it to be true, Lee Child has written a bad Reacher book. I wish I could get my money back. After hearing that he approved Tom Cruise, about as unReacher-like an actor as there is, to play Reacher in an upcoming movie I won't see, he gives us this - a story in which he couldn't even come up with a good villain. It just seemed to go on and on, while I waited for it to get interesting. I think Lee Child has run out of plot ideas for Jack Reacher. Too bad, it was fun while it lasted, but he just wrote this one for the money. Choosing Tom Cruise may have guaranteed some box office for the movie, but he sold out his fans.

This would make an excellent movie, by the way.<br /><br />I did not see the ending coming, and even when I was halfway through the twist I still didn't really see where it was going. (And I usually see twists which ruins a lot of books and movies.) Is it believable? Yes, enough. It's not so far out there that it's impossible, but a little suspension of disbelief helps. It's an entertaining book.

B005LAIIA8|5.0|MOVIE REVIEW # 54 \\"Frankenweenie<br /><br /> Getting a chance to see a screening of this film and listening to Executive Producers Allison Abbate (The Iron Giant, Fantastic Mr. Fox) and Don Hahn (The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast) talk about working with Writer, Producer and Director Tim Burton (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood) was truly a fantastical experience. \\"Working with Tim and his amazing mind was an incredibly fun and fulfilling experience,\\" explains Allison who now has worked with Burton three times, \\"He has an amazing mind and vision that made this project very, very personal to him.\\"<br /><br />Disney's release of \\"Frankenweenie\\" is a stop-motion animation film that takes an original short film that Burton did almost 30 years ago called \\"Vincent\\" (which launched his live-action career) and expands it into a real full feature-length adventure that is not only heartfelt but pays homage to all the old Sci-Fi and Monster horror films of the 30's, 40's and 50's. The characters are nods to every creepy, archetypical and funny monster-type you can think of and all done in black & white with amazing special effects all in a very inviting3D film.<br /><br />The story is about a boy named Vincent (voiced by Charlie Tahan of Charlie St. Cloud and I Am Legend) and his dog Sparky. It is a really true relationship that eventually runs into a serious accident that requires the dog Sparky to come back to life. Without his parents knowing, he brings Sparky back to life in a very unique way! Did I mention his parents are Mr. and Mrs. Frankenstein? They are passionately and cleverly voiced by Martin Short (Mars Attack, Father of the Bride) and Cathrine O'Hara (Beetlejuice, Home Alone) who both do two other clever voices each and you'll never guess which ones until the credits!<br /><br />Vincent is inspired by an eccentric old teacher who is masterfully voiced by the voice artistry of Academy Award Winning Martin Landau (Space:1999, Ed Wood). \\"It was an amazing script. Something I believed in and just a joy to do the film,\\" explains Martin, \\"Tim is amazing and his characters are full of depth and imagination. This film actually `invites' you into the picture because of this style of 3D they used. I've never seen that before.\\"<br /><br />\\"Every frame in this movie is Tim Burton. There isn't a detail that he didn't oversee, \\"explains Producer Allison Abbate, \\"That is probably why the team took over two years to make this final product and did it with all their heart and passion!\\"<br /><br />The true heart of the story is what not only Vincent learns about science and its importance in the world, but the fact that the town learns the true meaning of acceptance, in believing in yourself and the true bonding of a boy (or girl) and his pet. Also, Danny Elfman's (The Nightmare Before Christmas, Batman) score only enhances the thrills and chills and deep-felt heart of the entire project through each stop-motion frame.<br /><br />The town is sprinkled with the most fun and creepy cast of neighborhood kids and townspeople that make this an adventure and a visual fun classic. \\"It has an amazing truth to it and it was a very personal project for Tim Burton,\\" explains Producer Don Hahn, \\"He and the team labored over the details of each maquette and their moves.\\"<br /><br />Of course the true test of any film is given by the reaction to an audience and this one made our audience and I'm sure will certainly make you laugh, panic, anticipate, be surprised and create tension and eventually will pull at your heart-strings more than once. It is great fun for the whole family and sure to be another new Halloween classic to enjoy year after year!thing I believed in and just a joy to do the film,\\" explains Martin, \\"Tim is amazing and his characters are full of depth and imagination.

B008B0QH5S|5.0|Pet Shop Boys have been making music for more than two decades and it is always hard for artists to come out with consistent albums in their latest stages. Age, tiredness, personal issues: those are all barriers that an artist must confront once youth has gone away and they have lost their hair if not their minds.<br /><br />The Pet Shop Boys manage to take these weaknesses and turn them into strength: the whole album is a persistent reflection on the loss of youth and facing death. From the very opening (\\"Leaving\\") to the final song (\\"Requiem...\\"), the dead are all over the songs. The name of the album itself, Elysium, makes a reference to the place where the heroes go to rest after death.<br /><br />However... for all the poignancy of songs like \\"Invisible\\", there's some uplifting, banging tune like \\"A Face Like That\\". Invisible wouldn't be out of place in their Behaviour album (the chord changes remind me a little of DJ Culture, though) and A Face Like That could be sitting right in the middle of Introspective, reminding us of Domino Dancing and Love Comes Quickly.<br /><br />There are some incredible hooks in there: \\"Memory of the Future\\" had me singing the chorus on first listen, while \\"Ego Music\\" will have you repeating ME ME ME ME YES YES YES YES, YOU YOU YOU YOU NO NO NO NO in less than a minute. The dry humour of Chris and Neil permeates through tracks like \\"Ego Music\\" (which made me laugh out hard with its closing lines) and \\"Your Early Stuff\\", a perfect mix of irony, being upset and sadness.<br /><br />\\"Hold On\\" shines in the middle of the album in a curious way (or should I say \\"a queer way\\") reminding me more of Douglas Adams than something written by Tennant/Lowe. It's an apocalyptic musical piece with an uplifting message. And \\"Everything Means Something\\" sounds like Depeche Mode, dark and filled with synth lines.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the Pet Shop Boys, you should buy this album. There are no \\"Nightlife\\" tracks in here. This is pure, unfiltered Pet Shop Boys.<br /><br />If you are not a fan of the Pet Shop Boys, buy this album nonetheless. This is essential listening, showing at once how can one age gracefully by admitting your own flaws and failures. Luckily for us (and for every Mick Jagger or Madonna out there), we have these fine british gentlemen reminding us that although youth is great, it doesn't last forever and we must \\"enjoy it while it lasts\\". Death is around the corner but we can shine before we disappear.
B0086DBE62|1.0|I wanted to like it, really.  This movie couldn't decide whether to be camp, funny, dramatic, or a session for horrible over-acting.  Some movies CAN pull that identity crisis off (think \\"Mummy\\" with Brendon Fraiser), but alas not \\"Mirror Mirror\\".  There were some good special effects (when she goes through the mirror), the seven -- I'm gonna say it! -- DWARVES were great (on stilts while being bandits and each with a different wonderful personality), but all that can't make up for lameness this epic.  I am so glad I only rented this movie and didn't waste my money to see it in the theater.  I'd give it a rotten tomato if I could!<br /><br />Spend your time watching \\"Snow White And The Huntsman\\" (which I did the next night).  You'll thank me later.
B009329Y30|4.0|Realistic view of post-war trauma and how two soul mates help each other recover and love again. Great acting makes this an enjoyable to watch movien.
B0012GTZC0|2.0|I have been a Ken Follett fan, and so I bought this book hoping for intrigue like the Key to Rebecca, and sweeping detail like Pillars of the Earth. I was disappointed on both counts. A contributing factor is that I'm still kind of new to reading e-books on my Kindle Fire, although I doubt that had much impact on my impressions of the content. The neglected wife's way-too-detailed-and-lengthy sex with the spy and the lack of impactful suspense negated what could have been a great read. I'll read more of Follet's work, but right now the score is: 2 good ones, 1 disappointment.
B0091QSNEE|1.0|ok...so this looks cute but I cannot figure how to it started for my child. I get as far as the guests getting out of the car. it wont let me do anythg else...even on the free version. what am I doing wrong? this is a kindle fire app, right? and I cannot find any instructions for this either...so plz help!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I am having a great time playing this game it helps me pass the time I feel like a real setteler
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I won't go into detail since many others have done a far better job than I can. I'm only about 1/3 through this book so far. I was very disappointed in Feast for Crows and this book will join that one in the disappointment category. Storm of Swords was sooooo good! I didn't expect the 4th and 5th books in the series to be as good, especially since I had read the reviews, but my gosh. I'd say it's a fast read because you can skip a lot except in places it's so boring that I tend to fall asleep (I only have time to read at night). I wanted to read Dance with Dragons right away since I have been reading the entire series this year after getting hooked on the HBO show. All I can say is, I hope Winds of Winter is better and doesn't take Mr. Martin 5 years to publish because in 5 years, not only will I have forgotten everything I've read, but I may not care. I guess if you're a fan of the Song of Fire and Ice as I am, this is a must read, as I considered it, but be prepared to slog through it and be prepared for the characters to act differently than they did in Storm of Swords. 'Nuff said.
0385536828|2.0|It is a scary thing when a male author writes in the voice of a woman and Ian McEwan did not pull it off here.  His narrator is a new feminist of the early '70's and virtually nothing about her rings true.  Every man she meets has physical short-comings, but she falls in love with him anyway.  She starts a job in MI6 as some sort of low level file clerk and then goes into the \\"field\\" if you can call it that.  She is to recruit an author to write of patriotic and anti-communist things.<br /><br />Her most notable asset is that she is a self-described speed reader.  Part of her secret to speed is to skip over long descriptions.  I found myself skipping over the long literary descriptions - they were tedious, presumptuous and added nothing to the plot.  As a matter of fact, most of the book was tedious and presumptuous and the plot was lacking.  There was one reference when our heroine was about to go into the field about the Booker Man prize.  I thought for a while this was to be a satire, but it was not.  It may have been more interesting if it were.<br /><br />The narrator and the other characters were full of themselves, predictable and boring.<br /><br />I think you either love McEwan or hate him.  Or, in the alternative, you are like me and love some of his stuff and hate others.  The latter are usually detached, over wrought and tiresome.  I found this to be the worst of that last lot.
B004SUDQ8Q|5.0|A wonderful movie pitting the misguided colonial \\"improvement\\" of nonchristian native children and the love of family and culture in the 20th century in down under.  Young lady is perfect, this movie made me mad, happy, cry, laugh, and understand the worst and the best of human nature, and it was entertaining.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child always \\"captures\\" me in his Reacher books...can't put them down.  The only problem is I hear that Tom Cruise may play Reacher in the movie and that is absurd...Reacher is 6'6, and Cruise is 5'7or 8.  What is he going to fight...people my size (I am 5'1\\")!  Give me a break!  Clive Owen, both  tall AND rugged looking should have gotten this role.  Good Grief!!!  Or how about Jim Clavezal (sp?)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I suggest everyone read this book! male or female its amazing...fast pace and always a twist and turn. i loved it
B0092MKTL2|5.0|This band really is amazing. They were able to mix so many different genres of music together in a very complimentary way. It is hard for me to go from listening to them to listening to someone else sometimes because they do such a good job at everything that I don't know who to compare them to. I also really like them because they're music is clean yet entertaining. I would recommend them to anyone and have already recommended them to all my friends.
B0097S0TM0|5.0|P!nk has done it again!  Another great album, it's entertaining, sarcastic and fun and of course the girl can sang!! Can't wait for the concert tour!
B009JBZH54|5.0|■■ Just a Heads-Up, Amazon has merged reviews for The Dark Knight Trilogy, and the Dark Knight Trilogy Ultimate Collector's Edition (UCE). This is a review for just the Dark Knight Trilogy. I also have a review for the UCE which can also be found here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SINGTZGPMNK1/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DUCXFUC&linkCode=&nodeID=&tag=<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Disregard all the naysayers claiming this is a money grab. No, it's called having a choice. Not everyone wants the Super Duper Ultra Rare Limited Collector's Edition, that's often filled with a bunch of useless physical items. Some people just want to have the trilogy and nothing more. For $30 (currently), you get just that, and even a little bit more.<br /><br />You get the following in the Blu-ray edition:<br /><br />Disc 1: Batman Begins Feature Film<br />Disc 2: The Dark Knight Feature Film<br />Disc 3: The Dark Knight Special Features<br />Disc 4: The Dark Knight Rises Feature Film<br />Disc 5: The Dark Knight Rises Special Features<br /><br />PLUS you get a 64 Page excerpted (i.e. shortened) version of the wonderful book: \\"[[ASIN:1419703692 The Art and Making of The Dark Knight Trilogy]]\\"<br /><br />That is tremendous bang for your buck! Not only with the movies, but there are hours and hours of special features included too, including a documentary about the Batmobile. The Ultimate Collector's Edition, which won't be released for another year will no doubt cost at least twice as much. The only thing I have a problem with here is the cover art. It just doesn't look anything like  Nolan's Batman.<br /><br />The DVD version of the Trilogy is a 3-disc set and lacks many of the extras found in the Blu-ray set, but it does look nicer. It has a lenticular cover featuring the Batman sign from all 3 movies. It looks really cool compared to the cover used for the Blu-ray edition.<br /><br />All in all, this is a wonderful set to get if you don't own any of the movies yet. Heck, even if you do, it's still a great value if you just want The Dark Knight Rises. Consider TDKR sells for around $20-25, for just a few bucks more you get the 2 preceding films, and a book. You really can't go wrong here!<br /><br />Here is a list of the Special Features that included. The list may not be all-inclusive. The set has no exclusive features, but rather, the same ones that come with the individual releases<br /><br />BATMAN BEGINS SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />■ In-Movie Experience: Christopher Nolan, David S.

B0082GQ5HG|5.0|Hilarious Aardman movie.. I watched it with two other adults who loved it. More laughs in the first 1/2 hour than most comedies I've seen in the last five years! So many small details and funny lines off camera, you'll want to see it at least twice. If you like the first four Wallace & Gromit movies, you will love this, there are several references here (like music queues, animation style, etc.). It also looks beautiful in Blu-ray, you could use it for a demo-disc. Originally shot in 3D, I'm sure that looks amazing as well. Top notch.
B005LAII62|5.0|Movies dealing with bullying aren't anything new, but the way this film approached it is unlike any other I've ever seen. It doesn't sugarcoat some harsh truths about the cruelty of humanity, at one point even saying flat out that if circumstances were different, the bullied would probably be bullies themselves. But it still lets us know that things aren't all hopeless and things really can improve.<br /><br />The characters are freshly honest and real in the way they act towards each other, and the twists and turns the film goes through are thrilling and tense and makes the audience stop and thing. The only true bad guy in the film is society and what it can do to otherwise good people.<br /><br />It's the movie that goes where other films like it dare not to tread, and I applaud it for that.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|If you are like me, and love to know what makes people (and your favorite characters) tick, then this is the book for you.  The last few chapters give you a wonderful insight into Christian and are told from his perspective.  I was sorry to see the series end and wanted more!
0525952926|5.0|From page 1 of Winter of the World:  Book Two of the Century Trilogy, I was hooked.  Book One had been good, but Book Two is so much better in its character development and the pace of the story.  The background of the book covers what is going on in the world between the early 1930's to the middle 1950's; this is not an in-depth history book, but rather a socio-history record.  Through the characters of the book we gain a greater understanding of how history evolved and impacted not only the various societies as a whole but also the every day life.<br /><br />If I were teaching history, I would definitely make Fall of Giants:  Book One of the Century Trilogy and Winter of the World:  Book Two of the Century Trilogy required reading, not for battle and military campaigns, but for an understanding of how the events of those times impact the lives of the times.<br /><br />I anxiously look forward to the third volume.
0385344333|1.0|I was a great Reacher fan until the stories became repetitive and unbelievable. This is just another Reacher story set in the heart of small-town America, with Reacher pitted against mundane, greedy villains who have absolutely no chance of winning against Reacher's superior physical strength and Army training. And of course, there is the unbelievable ending with Reacher as a one-man Amazing Hulk in an abandoned Army facility. I was so disappointed in this book because Lee Child has proven he can write a dynamic, well-written story, but he's not coming through for his fans anymore. And I agree with the reviewer who wrote that Tom Cruise is a bad choice to portray Reacher on film. I like Tom Cruise, but it's simply not his role for obvious reasons. Lee Child, please bring the real Reacher back -- he is now less than the \\"idiot Puller.\\"
B008NMT684|4.0|my grandson loves puzzles and he also loves trucks. this is great for keeping him busy and winding down before nap time.
B0076794IO|3.0|This could have been a great book but it was clearly wrapped up a little too quickly.<br />But entertaining none the less...
B007TNS6JI|5.0|i love this game. the flow is great. each level provides me with a challenge. i would recomend this game to any rpg player.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|The promotion and advertisement of this film (upon release into the theaters) was just bad. The trailers I watched made no sense and I had no idea what this film was about so I never went to see it.  Apparently, not many did.  It's such a pity because once I watched it (amazon instant video) I found a wonderfully rich story nestled inside the packaging of a typical action/adventure.  Oh, I think I like this! Then my family watched it and really liked it as well.  It's a great family film.  It was a job well done in terms of making a fun, entertaining family friendly motion picture that you can watch again.  If only 'they' had promoted it properly - made trailers that illuminated the story better, maybe we'd have gone to the theater to see it - and then, maybe, they'd have plans to make a sequel.  I very much would like to see 'what happens next' at the end of the film - in a sequel.  Unlikely now.<br /><br />A great family film.  There aren't many of them made these days.  Definitely worth seeing!
B0058YPL66|4.0|This DVD set was built up to encourage buying by stating there  would be LOTS of deleted scenes and we would find out all sorts of stuff they didn't have time to broadcast.  The deleted scenes are useless and deserve to be deleted. Nothing new is revealed.<br /><br />The show itself, however, is great and worth buying if you just want to re-watch it. (which you can do on Netflix and HULU).
B008578PRK|4.0|My wife and I really had a great time watching this one. Certainly there were some holes in credulity like any horror movie, but the atmosphere and acting lifted the overall product. An unexpected reflection made me scream, to my wife's delight and laughter...
0307272702|5.0|A book that will change your life. It started a thirst to find out more and debunked many common ideas we all have regarding nutrition. Once you try it for yourself, you will never turn back.
B0090EIILU|2.0|This movie fell flat with poor humor.  It did not bring anything new to the once funny Cohen.  I did not even finish the movie
B00007KGCW|1.0|Very disappointed that I cannot even use this dvd because it is incapatible with my dvd players here in Missouri....a waste of money
B0085A9J18|5.0|I've been looking forward to this movie since I saw the trailers over 6 months ago. I was not disappointed. Although it is a slow starter, don't give up, less than 10 minutes from the beginning, the action begins. And there is non stop action for then next 90 minutes.<br /><br />The movie is set in Indonesia and stars 2 powerhouses, 1 is a Karate Champion and the other the martial arts choreograher of the movie. What makes it even more intersting is that they are secondary characters and on opposite sides of the law. The Star of the movie, IKO UWAIS, is AWSOME!<br /><br />A SWAT team arrives at a 15 story building with the intent of taking down a drug boss and bringing him in. He is ruthless and smart, surrounding himself with people that can benefit him in different ways. What the SWAT team does not know is just how well fortified or how well guarded it is. They soon discover they have been setup and are trapped on the 6th floor surrounded by thugs,murderers and men that have just been given an open invitation and monetary incentive to take out the team by any means necessary; and it is brutal. Their survival now hinges on fighting their way out. Floor by floor action and mayhem ensues and IKO UWAIS gives us some of the best choregraphied fighting action scenes that will rival and surpass JET LI!<br /><br />This movie is geat and leaves you tired, so intense is the fighting. Also check out the special bonus features as it will give you more insight as how they filmed it and what the director was going for. In this case he was spot on in both the action and the camaradie that he was hoping to interject in the plot.
0199270295|5.0|This is undoubtedly the best modern book for learning organic chemistry. Unlike some other books which present organic chemistry as a set of facts and reactions to be learnt and memorized, this book instead emphasizes the unifying threads between different concepts and also stresses the assimilation of those concepts through real-life applications. Common themes such as syn-anti addition, carbocations and orbital overlap tie together disparate reactions and aspects of organic chemistry.<br /><br />The first edition of this book was published in 2001 and the updated edition in 2012, so the discussion in this book includes reactions and reagents that are often missing from other comparable texts. For instance the volume still provides the most complete and readable description of the Grubbs metathesis reaction that I have come across, clearly emphasizing the mechanism, the effects of different ligands and solvents and applications to complex natural products. Other reactions of paramount importance to both academia and industry which are presented in the book include the palladium-catalyzed Suzuki, Heck, and Sonogashira couplings (which were recently awarded the Nobel Prize). The Buchwald-Hartwig reaction which was not as developed in 2001 but which has since seen immense growth gets an especially detailed mention.<br /><br />The volume covers the whole gamut of current organic chemistry. Apart from its modern and unifying outlook, the other feature that stands out is the way it stresses the practical relevance of all this material. Organic chemistry is really the basis of our modern way of life and the book reflects this fact. The value of almost every important reaction and reagent is demonstrated by its application to the synthesis of an important drug, polymer, food additive or agrochemical. The book also does a great job of illustrating the great value of simple concepts; for instance, one chapter discusses the application of pKa to the development of the bestselling drug ranitidine, another provides an explanation of the lachrymatory (tear-inducing) properties of onions as rooted in sigmatropic reactions involving sulfur compounds. From the clinic to the kitchen, this book drives home the fact that organic chemistry is not just an intellectually rewarding exercise but is at the foundation our daily existence.<br /><br />In addition to these qualities, the book is written in an honest, informal style and the authors admit uncertainty where it exists. Color enhances bonds, atoms and mechanistic arrows while boxed material contains key concepts and intriguing examples. Overall we are treated to an incredible amount of information in an attractive format and the authors must have really spent a lot of efforts in planning and presenting it. In its second edition this book continues to be an extremely useful source for students and practitioners alike and it is highly recommended.ling drug ranitidine, another provides an explanation of the lachrymatory (tear-inducing) properties of onions as rooted in sigmatropic reactions involving sulfur compounds.

0345803485|2.0|This book is definitely not worthy of all the attention it has gotten. It's poorly written and uses the same 3 words to describe Christian Grey's facial expressions. Someone please buy E.L. James a thesaurus! The story line is interesting but nothing to write home about.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Mumford & Sons first album, but built on a career of amazing music. This is a wonderful CD and would be a great gift for someone who enjoys folk, bluegrass, or alternative music.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|The book continued the story of Lisbeth Salander and maintained its gripping style and gave the reader a suspenseful ending with a colorful twist.
030758836X|2.0|I don't think I have ever read a more depressing novel, and I use the term \\"horrible\\" to describe the content more than the writing itself.  Ms. Flynn, the author, clearly has talent when it comes to telling a story; I only wish she wouldn't waste her time (and ours -- I was stuck with this thing by my book club) by writing, with seeming relish, about the stuff of nightmares and utter hopelessness: she gives over 400 pages of careful attention to a sociopathic monster (a pathological, soulless liar determined to subdue and crush anyone who doesn't live up to her expectations or gets in her way), and the rest of the characters were not any more likable.  Reading the other reviews reveals to me that loads of people think this was a fabulous book, and it certainly had its twists and turns -- it was like observing a train wreck in slow motion, you were compelled to watch until the end -- but there was nothing good in it, only darkness, cruelty, nastiness and defeat. To the potential buyer/reader - caveat emptor. I am throwing this one away.
B006LSZECO|1.0|The quality of a novel depends partially on the resolution to the conflicts that underlie the plot - and the resolution of this story was patently ridiculous.  Regardless of how well a writer can create characters and devise an interesting plot, if the resolution is so unbelievable that the reader no longer \\"loses herself\\" in the story, reading the book is a waste of time - and that's how I felt about this book.

0307352145|4.0|When I saw this book, Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain, I knew I had to choose it for my review. I am an introvert and was interested to see what Mrs. Cain had to say about it.<br /><br />To be honest, I did not finish reading this book. I pretty much sped read through the last half of the book. I was getting a bit bogged down with reading it. I think my favorite section was the introduction. In the author's introduction she mentions Rosa Parks and a few other famous people. There's a questionnaire to find out whether you are more of an introvert or extrovert or in-between. For myself, I definitely am an introvert. She also explains the psychology of introversion/extroversion.<br /><br />There are four parts to this book. In Part Two: The Extrovert Ideal, Susan Cain mentions Dale Carnegie and the changes that he went through and became a great public speaker. She<br />also talks about the Tony Robbins seminar (he was driving be bonkers), the Harvard Business School, Saddleback Church, plus many other studies and examples.<br />Part Two: Your Biology, Your Self? has many example of people who were/are extroverts/introverts. I did finally find a nugget that I liked. On page 173, it says,\\"If you are an introvert, find your flow by using your gifts. You have the power of persistence, the tenacity to solve complex problems, and the clear-sightedness to avoid pitfalls that trip others up....So stay true to your own nature. If you like to do things in a slow and steady way [I do], don't let others make you feel as if you have to race.\\"<br />Part Three: Do All Cultures Have An Extrovert Ideal? and Part Four: How To Love, How to Work, I will not write much about. I skipped over most chapters.<br /><br />The conclusion has a quotation that I like. It's from Anais Nin and it says, \\"Our culture made a virtue of living only as extroverts. We discouraged the inner journey, the quest for a center. So we lost our center and have to find it again.\\"<br />Susan Cain shares some ideas for those who are extroverts wanting to help introverts or those who are introverts themselves. I like this, especially since I myself was a quiet child and my children are more quiet (in public anyway): \\"If your children are quiet, help them make peace with new situations and new people, but otherwise let them be themselves. Delight in the originality of their minds. Take pride in the strength of their consciences and the loyalty of their friendships. Don't expect them to follow the gang. Encourage them to follow their passions instead. Throw confetti when they claim the fruits of those passions, whether it's on the drummer's throne, on the softball field, or on the page.\\"<br /><br />Overall it's a good book with some great nuggets to remember.<br /><br />I received this book for free from Waterbrook Multnomah Publishers for my honest review.d it again.\\"<br />Susan Cain shares some ideas for those who are extroverts wanting to help introverts or those who are introverts themselves.

0525953728|5.0|This book MUST be made into a movie ASAP - provided the author is the executive technical advisor. I would be highly disappointed if \\"Hollywod\\" types got a hold of this and try and turn into Rambo or something of the sort.  I have been waiting since day one to read an accurate account of how the most wanted man in American history was pursued and then exterminated and this \\"Mark Owen\\" delivered 110% in riveting detail.  This was probably the fasted book I've ever read as I hard time placing my bookmark to take a break.  It was written as if he was telling his story directly to me in person.  I served in the Navy for 20 years but the SEALs are so illusive that I was barely aware of their importance let alone their missions in anti terrorism and everything else under the sun.  \\"No Easy Day\\" has awakemed my awareness and renewed my respect and admiration I have for these fearless warriors. If there was one thing I would like to do is shake this mans' hand and buy him a beer.
B007SSEBCU|4.0|I don't know the story of Margaret Thatcher well enough to know how accurate this movie was, but it was a very well acted slice of life.  We enjoyed watching it.
B005KGPC4S|4.0|For years, Kevin Smith's movies have made me cringe. While I liked Clerks and Chasing Amy when I was younger, his other films never did anything for me. I didn't know what it was until just a couple of years ago when it hit me- his characters are just outlets for his speeches/observations. It got annoying enjoying a movie [to an extent] and then suddenly, one of the characters kicks in with some 'witty' speech. Needless to say, I had zero interest when I heard about Red State. Supposedly his last film as a director, and a huge departure from anything he's done before, I still wasn't buying it. But tonight I finally decided to give it a shot, and good lord, I was blown away. There are barely any Kevin-isms in the whole movie, it's a legitimately good thriller, it moves at a good pace, and I enjoyed the resolution, while I usually don't like this kind of finish in other movies. And the best part? None of the usual Smith buddies make forced cameos here!<br /><br />The plot stats out simple enough- three horned up teen boys meet up with an older woman they meet on a Craigslist-like site. On their way to her home, they hit a car parked on the side of the road, and keep on going because...well, they're teen boys on a mission. When they get to the woman's trailer, she gives them some booze and tells them to go in the other room and undress. As soon as they get in there, they're knocked out and wake up, tied up, in a small church led by pastor Abin Cooper. This guy's so bad, even the skinheads want nothing to do with him. Imagine the Westboro Baptist Church members fused together into one being. That's him! The boys were brought in on the same night a man accused of loving another man is to be executed. The poor guy's been saran wrapped to a cross while a rubber ball in his mouth prevents him from speaking. Things are about to get messy. At the same time, the car that the boys damaged turned out to be the car of a local officer who sends one of his boys to find the car thatdid it. Guess where the car got moved to. Yep, things are about to get VERY messy.<br /><br />The story started out simple, and quickly turned into something I wasn't expecting. I've already mentioned how there's nothing 'Kevin Smith' about this movie, so I won't list more reasons why, but it's just such a shocker! Red State looks and feels like it was done by someone else. How is this made by the same guy that made Cop Out? Michael Parks does a fantastic job as Cooper, matching how a lot of crazed religious people are in real life. He has that cool exterior and knows how to pull one's strings to get them motivated and do his work. One thing that got me was how as soon as the boys are brought to the church, they're downgraded to minor characters. This seems to bug a lot of people, but I had no problems with it. They were there to introduce us to the real characters, and they did their job. We may not learn anything about them, yet seeing them scared for their lives while imprisoned, you can't help but want them to make it out alive. John Goodman, who I always enjoy, does a great job here too, as the only other real main character, Agent Keenan. The supporting cast members all do fine as well, though no one else stands out, given that the dialogue is almost entirely shared between Parks and Goodman halfway through the movie.<br /><br />I don't want to ruin any of the surprises that happen after the first portion of the movie, so I'll avoid talking about the second half. Again, I was pleasantly surprised at what takes place. It's been a long time since someone's death surprised me in a movie, and Red State managed to surprise me on more than one occasion. They weren't jaw-dropping scenes by any means, but it was how suddenly and unexpectedly they happened. Most of the time it's obvious when someone's about to get killed off. Here? Not so much. Red State also surprised me by not being a big anti-religious mess like many other similar films. Smith isn't saying anythingbad about Christianity here- it's obvious from the beginning that Cooper's people are loopy. We've all seen people like this before, and nothing is over exaggerated.<br /><br />There was -one- point early on where I thought Red State was going to lose me. It was when the boys awake in Cooper's church and he goes off about the heathens and everything wrong with the world today. The scene wasn't bad, just a little too long for my tastes before it got moving along. But hey, isn't that how it is at church most of the time? I'd be lying if I said I wasn't letting my mind wander during this bit. It's still an ok scene, and serves its purpose- to show how dedicated Cooper is to what he thinks is doing God's work.<br /><br />Red State...a movie so surprisingly good that it almost clears Smith for Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. I actually hope he directs one or two more movies that aren't like his usual schtick now. Good job Smith.

B0071XO8RA|3.0|This book was recommended by a friend. It is a good read, but nothing I haven't read before. I enjoyed the concept and the scifi feel, but I must say the end was predictable. I would recommend this book, but not if you are looking to read a book with crazy twists and turns.
B001A4LYN2|3.0|As is all-too-often the case, this movie ended rather too abruptly. We need to see a thoroughly evil person like this get his just deserts!
B003B02PFO|4.0|This is a hilarious relay of the rush of Christmas, that all of us go through once in a life time. I laugh so hard, I woke the household, and have every one getting to read it also.  The characters are going overboard at times, but it makes the whole story so enjoyable.  I could picture the scenes in my mind, and when I saw the movie, it has done the book justice.  For every one that needs a good belly laugh, this is the book to read.  Very un-John Grisham, but fun!!
B004R36QUE|5.0|A very well acted and directed movie. I have watched it at least ten times and keep being drawn to watch it again.
B003XYE7R2|5.0|For me, this is by far the best story that Conan Doyle wrote. The<br />build-up of the atmosphere on the mysterious moor where the<br />Hound of Baskerville is told to reside is brilliant. The pace of the<br />story is perfect. The characters introduced, the twists and<br />turns, and the grand finale will keep you enchanted from beginning to end.

B000JMKTLO|4.0|I am rarely disappointed by Gillian Flynn books, and this one is no exception. If you like thrillers and are looking for a page turner, this is a great choice. I did have a hard time sympathizing with the main character at times, which is why this got a four rating. But overall it's a very entertaining book.
B0084B5TK8|3.0|A phenomenal (and classic) story that Stoker weaves together mainly from<br />diary-entries story-telling. But despite the creative brilliance, the book<br />is also quite slow and even repetitive i the middle parts.<br />The interaction between the characters is also over-dramatized<br />and over-emotional in many places.<br />But despite these shortcomings, the read is highly captivating.
B001M45ANK|5.0|I'm a sucker for musicals, Gease, Hairspray, you name it. Something about busting out and singing in every movement just gets me in a happy mood. The actors are great, Eddie Murphy and Jennifer Hudson really blew it out of the water! This movie is a must have and I never get tired of watching it.

B000LB7G00|5.0|Bought it for Inventor but soon after I've only used it for Solidworks. I just can't work without it, people reckon is just a pretty display but if you want productivity this is the tools to get. Best purchase ever made.
1451696205|3.0|I enjoyed the style of writing, as the author stuck to the premise that it was written by a teenaged boy, complete with choppy sentences and the lack of 'thesaurus' words.  It made you root for the kid the whole way through, but the ending left something to be desired.  Many questions were left unanswered, although a huge one was hinted at if not explicitly stated if one had been paying attention.<br /><br />It's definitely not a complete 'feel good' story that leaves you smiling when you're done, rather it's more of a rollercoaster of emotions and allows you to ride the highs and lows of that which is a socially awkward teenager's life.<br /><br />I'd recommend it, but not the kind of book you just can't put down or has a high reread value.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|my son and I have really enjoyed playing this game together. instead of a bedtime story we play this instead. its a must have for people who enjoy hidden pic and mystery.

B0017M413M|1.0|The original Stargate movie was great.<br />Stargate: Continuum was also good.<br />(And the plot is such that you can enjoy it without watching 7 seasons of TV episodes)<br /><br />Stargate: The Ark of Truth, however is just plain terrible.<br />The central piece of this movie is the Ark of Truth, but we never are never led to understand it, and it is never really explained.<br />It is simply a magic wand used to tie together a plot which has plenty of progression, but no purpose or direction.<br />The end result is nothing other than un-imaginative dross.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this second book of the Hunger Games trilogy.  It has a few unexpected twists.  I can't wait to begin to read the third in the series.
B008JFUUIA|2.0|The lovely Anna Kendrick (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World) stars in Pitch Perfect, a film produced by actress Elizabeth Banks (People Like Us) that could be the product of a hook-up between television's \\"Glee\\" and the Scary Movie franchise. It starts off with an unexpected gag (quite literally) and stumbles along for nearly two hours, trying to figure out what kind of movie it wants to be. It has romance, a few heartwarming moments (mostly at the end), some scenes that try to be comedy but aren't funny, and some halfway decent tunes. It won't have you running home to purchase the soundtrack, though, although the \\"Cups\\" scene is certainly worthy of mention. It certainly does not compare to \\"Glee\\" and seems to be an obvious attempt to cash in on a cash cow.<br /><br />So the plot goes like this. Snobby Aubrey (Anna Camp) and likeable Chloe (Brittany Snow) need to recruit girls for their school's acapella girl group, the Barden Bellas, in order to beat rival boy group the Treblemakers at next year's competition. It seems that the unlikely scenario has occurred in which their entire group, aside from Aubrey and Chloe, have graduated. Beca (Kendrick) is new to the school, and she desires a career in making music. She doesn't want to be a singer - she literally wants to make music. She regularly combines samples on her laptop to create mash-ups that aren't anything special. She is told she is \\"very good\\", but her songs beg to differ.<br /><br />Beca shares a room with stereotypical Asian roommate Kimmy Jin (Jinhee Joung) who, no joke, is tinkering with a gold Bonsai tree when Beca arrives. Beca is the typical disgruntled child of a typical broken home with a throwaway dad who she typically blames for the divorce. Yawn. On her first day, Beca has a run-in with Jesse (Skylar Astin), who is the obvious love interest. Despite appearing like a jerk while attempting to be endearing, Jesse becomes more likeable throughout the film. Luke (Freddie Stroma) is Jesse and Beca's boss at the college radio station where they end up landing jobs without being interviewed, and we don't see nearly enough of this genetically superior specimen. What follows amongst the three of them is a love triangle so subtle that it would be undetected and forgettable if Jesse didn't keep reminding us of it with his jealousy over Beca's assumed fawning.<br /><br />Benji (Ben Platt), Jesse's weird roommate (as we're reminded multiple times), is the kid you try to avoid in the high school halls while not realizing that he is just \\"sweet and misunderstood.\\" You hope he doesn't kill himself halfway through the film. He is obsessed with magic and idolizes the Treblemakers to a creepy level, but it's okay, because he's really just an innocent. He attempts to join the group, only to be bullied by the lead douchebag, Bumper (Adam DeVine). Seriously, that's his name - Bumper.<br /><br />Moving on, despite the new fad of films that showcase Ellen Page-type characters as female leads (i.e. likeable, no-nonsense, strong women), Beca sells out (as seen in the trailer), and decides to join the quirky Bellas after Chloe accosts her in the shower when she hears Beca's singing voice. But Beca sings along with the music she creates, so it is assumed that this can be enough to justify the oddity of her willingness to submit to a concept that she declined merely hours ago.<br /><br />The Bellas recruit the quirkiest auditioners (\\"Glee\\", anyone?), the most notable being Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson). Wilson earned the target spot in Entertainment Weekly's \\"Bulls-Eye\\" column last week, and it is easy to see why, as she is the Gimli of the group (i.e. chubby comic relief). She consistently pokes fun at her own weight before the \\"twig\\" girls can do it first, and despite being given a solo at one point, she does not have the vocals necessary to impress. Beca is obviously the She's All That type of girl who possesses all the talent and charm that we would all be privy to if she would just remove her nonexistent glasses and let her hair down, as Jesse is quick to point out. Thank you, Mr. Exposition.<br /><br />Arguably, the most enjoyable vocals in the group next to Beca is Cynthia Rose (Ester Dean), although they barely give her any lines and reduce her to yet another boring stereotype cliche. Of course she's the lesbian - she's the one with the crazy hair who wears flannel shirts. Yawn. Hana Mae Lee is snicker-worthy as Lilly, the token Asian of the group who speaks so quietly that you have to strain to hear her, although all she spews is Ralph Wiggum-type nonsense anyway.<br /><br />This is one of those films that shows you all of its best moments in the trailer, such as the \\"Riff-Off\\" in which both the Bellas and the Treblemakers meet in what appears to be a drained pool in a Jets/Sharks attempt to out-sing each other. For what purpose? It is never made clear, but it seems that the \\"Riff-Off\\" will determine who will win the competition. Not only is this completely inaccurate, but wouldn't you just watch each other's performances at previous competitions? It makes no sense, but it is fun, especially when Beca jumps in with her rendition of Blackstreet's \\"No Diggity\\".<br /><br />There is a moment in the film when Jesse is explaining to Beca, who is bored by all movies, that she needs to watch more of them because the endings are the best part, especially when they're unpredictable. This scene masquerades as a relieving foreshadowing, promising that this film will have the surprising and unpredictable ending that Jesse longs for in the films that he wants to someday score. The ending to Pitch Perfect is decent enough, but it certainly won't stick with you long after the film ends. It is not the Rudy of musical comedies.<br /><br />Banks and John Michael Higgins have cameos in the film a l&agrave; Jason Bateman and Gary Coleman's scenes in Dodgeball. They are announcers for these competitions, and they get ridiculously glam for the occasions, despite no one ever seeing them way up there in their booth. They say silly things that are meant to incite laughter but that are unfunny and insulting, like how women can't win a competition in much the same way that they shouldn't be doctors.<br /><br />In an attempt to explain that Aubrey is resistent to change, the script calls for The Bellas to perform the same tired version of \\"I Saw the Sign\\" multiple times until the audience in the film, along with the audience in the theater, falls asleep. These scenes could have actually been funny, if done right. The Bellas could have performed songs that no one had ever heard of, or that haven't been popular since the sixties or seventies. Hearing the same jaded '90s song over and over again felt like each audience member was Alex in A Clockwork Orange, forced to stare at the screen in agony to the point of retching. Speaking of retching...nah, that's a gross surprise you can find out on your own.<br /><br />Despite the moments of silliness in this film, though, the ending was enjoyable and will give you the warm and fuzzies. Despite being lauded as a \\"musical\\", this film does not require great acoustics or a theater viewing to get the necessary experience. This film can definitely be passed off as a rental if you'd rather save your cash. It was surprising to see Banks' name attached to a film of lackluster quality, and sad for Kendrick, who is usually equally enjoyable.

B004EPYZV2|5.0|I am a fan of Mission: Impossible from the beginning when a TV show. I have watched each and every story that has been produced.  This last assignment has not dissapointed in any way. Lots of cars, guns, fights and heart stopping action in this one as usual only better.  Tom Cruise isn't bad either.[[ASIN:B0066QRE2O Mission Impossible IV 4 Poster Ghost Protocol - 2011 Movie Promo Flyer - 11 X 17 Tom Cruise - Window MasterPoster Print, 11x17]]
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I've read a lot of military books so it's probably not too surprising that this one sounded so much like others, but most of the story really is boring.  I found the book very dull until the actual assault on Bin Laden's compound was described by the author.  That part I found very interesting... overall I give four stars for the assault narrative and one star for the rest of the book - average is three.

B00004Y3OU|5.0|I bought this film because I'm learning Italian and it was recommended to me by my Italian tutor. It is a well known film in Italy and it also has both English and Italian sub-titles in order to help me out as I try and learn the beautiful Italian language. If this is also your purpose then you'll not go wrong with this film.<br /><br />As for the film itself, I rather enjoyed the setting, in beautiful Sicily. The town the film is shot in looks like a fairy tale. We follow Toto from a child through to a successful film maker and his obsession with film. One can take many things from the film and I found myself thinking about it for a few days afterwards. It is not often this happens after watching a film, the ending was certainly thought provoking. The thing I took from it is that in life we should have balance. If you put everything into your career you will end up without the woman you love, as happened to Toto.<br /><br />Perhaps others will take something different but that's what I took from it. I am also likely to watch the film again, something I rarely do with films. Recommended.
B0034G4OYA|3.0|Hotel Transylvania has Dracula (Adam Sandler) as a peaceful monster who just wants a place for him and his monster buddies to have away from humans. So he turns his castle into a hotel. But eventhough Dracula wants to keep everyone inside and safe from angry mobs, his vampire daughter (Selina Gomez) wants to get out and explore the world.<br />  Dracula wants his daughter to think humans are all bad but when a harmless fun loving human (Andy Sanberg) wanders to the castle, Dracula tries to disguise him as a monster and sneak him out quickly. That doesn't go well since he meets Dracula's daughter and they hit it off without her knowing he's a human.<br />  The film may sound more like Hotel Happy Madison, since you have Sandler and his buddies like Kevin James (Frankenstein), Steve Buscemi (The Woofman) and the David Spade (The Invisibleman) doing voice work. However the film is better than most of their live action films and has much more of a plot than Grown-Ups did. I do admit though that it's not laugh out loud funny and that it mostly won me over with it's charm.

B008CLI3TE|5.0|I read all the books in the \\"A Song of Fire and Ice\\" series years ago. The story has been very well-adapted to the screen, remaining loyal to the source material. The cast and production are simply exceptional (and addictive).  Peter Dinklage (in the role of Tyrion Lannister) offers an outstanding performance. It is rewarding to see him in a such showcase role. Game of Thrones is an \\"epic,\\" so don't expect things to wrap up neatly at the end of an episode or a season.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have become addicted to this game. I am challenged by each new level.The graphics are easy to view. I appreciate the freedom to choose which game I want to play and not being locked into a progression of wins. If I get stuck on a game I can skip it and move ahead. Because the game isn't dependent upon the internet I can play whenever and where ever I choose.

B0053FANQS|5.0|Love the speed and action. Cars are beautiful until they crash. Getting to know the characters and when they all hook up. I've watch the entire series and like how the characters gel with each other. It's a great series.
1469984202|5.0|(this is a spoiler-free review with no story details)<br /><br />I found this book on a whim simply by typing \\"science fiction\\" into the Amazon search and sorting by review.  The Wool Omnibus popped up as having almost exclusively great reviews, although I didn't recognize the author.  I could tell by skimming the review titles that this would be a worthwhile read, and I ordered it.<br /><br />What a GREAT story.  Very unique and intelligent with terrific characters and dialogue.  Wool reminded me a lot of the way LOST (and Battlestar Galactica, for that matter) unfolded on TV, where in season one we thought we knew the boundaries of the story, but by season two we discover we had blinders on.  The writing is tight and the author takes no \\"deus ex machina\\" shortcuts, something that I am sadly seeing a lot of these days.  It is also not thick on overly complex science like some sci-fi, which is only accessible by diehard fans of the genre.  This is a story that anyone can enjoy.  There are moments in the story that involve panic and close confines, and it is the mark of a great storyteller, I think, when I find my own stress level begin to rise and realize I am holding my breath.  With the right actors and a decent budget this would translate perfectly to TV. Networks keep trying and failing to find the new Lost.  THIS IS IT.  Hugh Howie should already be a household name, but certainly a successful network series would rocket him to the next level.<br /><br />So psyched I found a new author to read, and that there is a follow-up!
B007L24T52|3.0|The book is good, but not great. I would recommend it to lovers of mystery novels, but don't expect it to be up there with the other masters

B007GCY8FS|4.0|Typical Lee Child/Jack Rracher novel.  Paced very well for the first two-thirds, then drags a bit.  Still an excellent novel of a good character.<br /><br />keep writing Reacher novels, Lee Child, but never agree to a 5'10\\" actor playing Reacher in a movie again.
B0061Q13V2|4.0|I loved this book!  For any fan of Dominique Moceanu/the 1996 Olympics gymnastics team.  This girl was my idol and this book showed a different, darker side to what we saw from her in the 90's.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love it. it is a very addicting game however I really wish the coins would regenerate faster so I can play longer.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Chilling prose is a very apt description. The writing is terrific, the story dark and enthralling. One of the best books I've read because it has both great prose and a great plot. If, however, you're looking for a happy ending, look elsewhere. Clearly, some who have left reviews were angry they didn't get that. This is a twisted psychological tale and not intended for the faint of heart. I wouldn't advise reading plot summaries, since spoilers will truly ruin the book for you. A woman has disappeared from a troubled marriage. The story is told from her point of view and from the husband's point of view. That's all the plot I'd want to know going in. Flynn does a fantastic job of slowly revealing these complex characters and events until she leaves you breathless. Good luck putting this one down.
B009329ZF2|4.0|This movie moves slow at first, and my husband and I were starting to regret purchasing it for rent, but we stuck with it.  Thank goodness!  It has a strong finish and the action is non-stop.  The only thing that bothered me (but was the only thing that tied it to the Hasboro game) was that the bombs were shaped like the game pieces.
0553801473|4.0|As with the other books of this series this book contained several twists that left you sitting on the edge of your seat and wanting more.  But, it gets somewhat confusing due to the numerous characters in the book and the constant switching between them all.  Furthermore, it does get slow at times, almost like Martin was bogging down.  It was still a great read though, and I would highly recommend all the books of the series.
B008RTE066|5.0|[[ASIN:B008RTE066 Magical Mystery Tour Deluxe Box Set (Blu-ray/DVD/double-vinyl EP)]]My research seems to indicate that Capital re-released MMT in 1976 with the true stereo version, on C1-48061. So try looking for one of those for something a little different. this is and was the only true stereo version of the MMT album until the 09/09/09 which was completely reedited remastered. all the previously released US. and japanese and uk. versions were all fake stereo. i have the true german version and anyone who has heard it knows the true  stereo separation horns in the title song are brighter crisper. and do not blend in and out of the left and right speakers. i paid a pretty penny for a near mint copy. of this and sorry but the new remastered CDS cannot touch it.

B008QE9XD2|1.0|Tim Burton's Dark Shadows is definitive proof that you really CAN polish a turd.  Yes, the movie's visuals are quite polished and easy on the eyes, but that does not give the rest of the movie a pass.  I am a fan of the original series, and I can tell you that this is by no means anywhere close to the spirit of the original material. I have heard from some that this is a \\"dark comedy.\\" I would have to disagree. This film plays like a broken metronome that bounces back and forth between puerile wacky slapstick and attempts at horror. The result is a two hour, $150 million identity crisis that is neither funny nor scary. I read recently that there was an earlier version of the script which was penned by John August, who wrote Tim Burton's \\"Big Fish\\". August's version was much darker, took itself more seriously, was more complex, and had more of a sense of history to it. August said that there were still some elements of humor to his version, but it wasn't in your face juvenile comedy. Burton and Depp decided to jettison August's script in favor of one written by Seth Grahame-Smith, whose credits include \\"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\\" and \\"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies\\". These books in Barnes and Noble stores reside in a niche section titled \\"Paranormal Teen Romance.\\" Every time I pass this section I have to do an eyeroll. Grahame-Smith had never even seen the original series. His \\"take\\" was written after viewing some episodes provided by Burton. If you ask the average fan of the original show what they remember most fondly about it they will most likely tell you that it was a particular story arc or a certain character, e.g. Quentin or the Reverend Trask. What you most likely NOT hear from them is that it was campy. That seems to be the one element that was taken from the source materiel and nothing else. If your movie is going to masquerade with the same name as the original, use the same character names as the original, include the name of the series creator inyour credits, and even use the same title font as the original, one would assume that you would at least try to retain the slightest semblance to the original. If Burton and Depp wanted to be the slightest bit honest about this movie, they should have named this effort \\"Puerile Crappy Vampire Out of Time Movie, with One-Joke Premise Stretched for Two Hours.\\" It also didn't help that Depp was made to like like a Geisha that was booted out of a Japanese anime cartoon.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read a lot and there have been very few books that left me emotionally raw when I was finished with them. Reflected in You is one of them. Because my mind was spinning and my words couldn't possibly do the book justice, I decided to take a few days and gather my thoughts. I'm glad I did because my thoughts at the time were more than an little incoherent and I really didn't want to spoil anything for anyone who stops by to read my review. Enough with my issues and on with the review.<br /><br />Reflected in You is the second book in Sylvia Day's fantastically erotic, contemporary romance Crossfire trilogy. I don't read a lot of contemporary romance but I love Ms. Day's Renegade Angels series so much and there was sooooo much hype surrounding Bared to You that I decided to give it a chance. I'm so glad I took a chance on this series and didn't write it off as just another Fifty Shades of Grey type book. We've all read the comparisons and I gotta say, I don't agree with it at all. Yes they are both contemporary erotic romance and yes they both feature a disturbed leading man but that is where the similarities end. Ms. Day does what many authors wish they could do successfully; she took two very damaged and broken characters, put them together, and proved that yes we frakked up individuals can find love.<br /><br />Reflected in You picks up right where Bared to You ended and shows that all relationships require time, work, and patience. In my opinion, Reflected in You is a better book. Eva and Gideon's journey isn't an easy one. Their relationship started as nothing more than sexual attraction but it grew into so much more. Anything worth having is worth fighting for and when you find someone who accepts you (warts and all) that person is worth walking through fire for.<br /><br />Reflected in You was super smexy and had me emotionally invested in ways very few books have ever been able to do. Eva and Gideon have come a long way in a very short period of time and I can't wait to see how their story ends with Entwined with You.
B002RI9QJE|4.0|Interesting learnings as to how decisions are made as well as hints to manipulate people! Also helpful in understanding ones own rationale for decision making. Lightly but deeply written and well resarched.
B000JMKO3C|1.0|This book is not for the feint of heart, or those people who are working through any sort of problems of their own in their personal life.  I felt like the author was too blunt, and the book was sad with no relief, or humor to offset some of the grueling details.  It was factual, to the point of brutality. It is definitely not escape fiction.<br />Before I purchased this book, I would have liked a more thorough review, such as  \\"a very tragic story,\\" or something along those lines.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|Amazing music and a touching love story where hope brings together a family that has been separated and miserable for over a decade.  Very under-rated movie and one that I recommend for viewers of all ages.
B007SGM084|5.0|These books were highly recommended by several friends.  They definately did not disapoint.  Hopefully there will be more.  Waiting on the next.
0425263908|4.0|I'm not big of contemporary romance but am a huge fan of Sylvia Day's Renegade Angels series. Because I love her paranormal romance so much I decided to give Bared to You a shot. Sylvia Day writes brilliantly complex characters that you can't help but feel for. Sometimes the most damaged are hardest to love and find it hardest to let themselves be loved. I feel that was beautifully conveyed in this book. Bared to You was gripping and emotional and I fell for Gideon. Hard. I look forward to seeing what happens in the next book in the series.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Sylvia Day's Renegade Angels series but are uncertain as to whether or not you want to take a chance on a contemporary, I suggest you jump in. Just know that you will become engrossed in this world in a way that Fifty Shades of Grey couldn't even touch.
B008PALI5S|5.0|If there's one thing Mahler wanted, it was to have as many performers as possible in his symphonies, none more so than the eighth, called \\"Symphony of A Thousand\\". However, rarely, if ever, did the complement of participants live up to the title claim.<br /><br />In this case, as well as a combined orchestral effort from the L.A. Phil. and the Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra of Venezuela, where they were able to double down on the strings and augment certain other sections, there is a choir combination totaling well over 1200 singers. 400 0f them are young children, who perform throughout without a score.  As besotted as Mahler was with his two little daughters, he would have been really touched, as I was, by the sight of all these youngsters singing their hearts out - and very well, too!<br /><br />Performances of this scale are usually cost-prohibitive, but I suspect these kids, having been given the benefit of free musical education by the Venezuelan state, probably did this just for the glory of it. And what a glorious sound they make.<br /><br />When I listen to this piece, surround sound volume cranked up, I expect to be overwhelmed at the Part One climax, and tearfully stunned at the end of Part Two! Mission accomplished in spades here on both counts.<br /><br />In bluray, the vista of all those people performing as one is breathtaking - you can see each one clearly.<br /><br />As hard as it is to get eight perfect soloists for this work, this is a better than average group here. I liked them all. In the Mater Gloriosa \\"balcony scene\\", we actually get to see Kiera Duffy's walk down the \\"aisle\\" several minutes before her two-line solo (which takes less time than the walk!). All in shimmering yellow and red lighting.<br /><br />No one would rate the L.A. or the Bolivar orchestras as top-echelon bands, but they acquit themselves very well, and they certainly have sheer numbers and volume on their side. Perfect ensemble has to be difficult with that many strings. Ithought the orchestral balance very good.<br /><br />I wasn't fond of Dudamel's Mahler 1 with the L.A. Phil.,(a bit too precious)but here I was impressed by his control and minimal histrionics. Very rarely did he refer to his score - for me that means he did lots of prep.<br /><br />The video is excellent, and the camera work likewise. The shots of the youngest children are priceless, some of them unable to resist the camera nearby!<br /><br />The DTS MASTER AUDIO sound really envelopes you - in fact, I heard a few too many creaks and other extraneous background noises, which is probably the result of some close miking. No matter - if I'd been fortunate enough to be there, I'd have heard worse.<br /><br />It's doubtful any other group will attempt to approach this Mahler 8 in size any time soon, if ever. A year ago, Chailly gave us an excellent version with the Leipzig forces, using more traditional size choirs. Bernstein's almost 40 year old version cannot compete in picture or sound, even though his efforts are always worth watching.<br /><br />We have been promised an Abbado/Lucerne 8th. to complete his Mahler cycle, but every year Claudio the Procrastinator finds a fresh excuse not to fulfil this promise (the latest purported reasons - pick one - are:- can't find the right singers, doesn't really like the piece, too much rehearsal needed, ill-health, Blah-blah-blah!) Meanwhile he has now got lapped by two excellent performances, after which, one has to ask, why bother, Claudio? This may be blasphemy to the Abbado acolytes, but I sure don't need another Mahler 8 on top of the Chailly and the Dudamel, as good as they are.<br /><br />This is an irresistible document of a once in a lifetime occasion. Buy it and love it!

B007V4530A|5.0|I was recently looking for some shorter length books to read on my Kindle and while browsing options on Amazon, I stumbled across a series of TED e-books.  It may be more accurate to describe them as white papers or articles instead of books, since they are all roughly 50-100 pages in length.  Since I am a fan of TED and am interested in improving my own presentation skills, I thought I'd start by reading the book `How to Deliver a TED Talk' by Jeremey Donovan.<br /><br />I was very impressed with the content and format of this book.  Although short in length, it is full of helpful presentation advise.  The following is a (partial) list of topics covered:<br /><br />1.  Selecting a Topic:  Identify a central idea and work backwards to establish an audience focused narrative that includes stories and facts.  Connect with the audience by focusing on people's inner needs for belonging, self-interest, self-actualization or hope.<br /><br />2.  Crafting a `Catchphrase':  Turn the central idea of the presentation into a memorable phrase that is implanted in the audience's mind.  An ideal catchphrase should be short (3-10 words) and action oriented.  A catchphrase should be repeated several times during the presentation.<br /><br />3.  Opening a Talk:  The first ten or twenty seconds of a speech is the peak of the audience's engagement.  Capitalize on this engagement by starting your speech with a compelling opening.  Personal stories, shocking/startling statements and powerful questions are all effective ways to open a presentation.  As a follow-up to the opening of your presentation, deliver a post-opening that informs the audience of the benefits they will gain from the presentation.<br /><br />4.  Building a Speech Body and Transitions:  The body of a presentation should ideally consist of three sections.  Segmenting a speech into three sections helps the presenter stay focused and helps the audience remember the message.  Several narrative styles may be utilized; three effective styles are the situation-complication-resolution framework, the chronological narrative and the idea-concepts description.  Transitions between sections of the speech should reinforce the key message of the prior section while teasing the audience with benefits of the upcoming section.<br /><br />5.  Concluding a Talk:  The conclusion of a speech is the final opportunity to inspire the audience or call them to action with an easy next step.  Use language that makes it clear the speech is ending.  A few possible conclusions to a speech are a call back to a personal story told earlier in the speech, a shocking statistic or compelling question.<br /><br />6.  Mastering Verbal Delivery:  When delivering a speech adopt a conversationalist tone and use everyday language in short sentence structures.  Avoid filler words by speaking in bursts followed by pauses.  Make liberal use of the word `you' to appeal to the audience.<br /><br />7.  Adding Humor to a Talk:  Humor should be embedded throughout the speech, strive for one joke every few minutes.  Utilize self-deprecation, exaggerated reality and challenges to authority to add humor.  Effective speakers `riff' on humorous themes in clusters of three.<br /><br />8.  Managing Your Physical Delivery:  When delivering a speech stand comfortably with hands down at your sides.  Gestures should be contained to the area above your waist and below your neck.  Maintain eye contact with individuals in the audience for three to five seconds.  If you are presenting to a large group, engage sections for one to three minutes.<br /><br />9.  Creating Visuals That Inspire:  Use as few slides as possible or no slides at all.  If you are using slides, keep them simple with short text and images.<br /><br />This is just a brief overview of the content covered in this book.  Every section is full of good examples that support the key ideas of effective presentations.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in improving their public speaking skills or wants to learn more about the format of a TED talk.ted in improving their public speaking skills or wants to learn more about the format of a TED talk.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|This is a 70's cult classic film, featuring the music of Cat Stevens and 2 world class stars. It is a coming of age story of a boy from a rich and emotionally removed mother, searching for meaning and purpose. The clips of his mother desperately trying to pair him with an appropropriate young lady , only to have the young man resort to more and more hilariously grusome acts , designed to horrify the ladies, makes it a comedy with underlying depth and meaning. He ultimately finds true love with the much older eccentric Ruth Gordon , and she leaves him with the question - to give up on life or embrace the possibilities of the future.

B005LAJ16I|4.0|The producers of Homeland said they did not want to get viewers, they wanted to create addicts. Certainly the show is engaging. It does draw you in, and you want to return to find out what will happen to these characters. Mission accomplished, then.<br /><br />Homeland is more realistic than 24, more human, more deliberately paced for the most part. The writing and acting are top notch. The first season is a solid success, and I surely hope the show won't go off the rails in seasons to come.<br /><br />I'm taking one star off for the basic premises behind the main characters -- the Marine Brody and the CIA gal Carrie Mathison. Could someone actually rise to that level in the CIA while keeping secret her mental condition and the drugs she had to take daily to keep it under suppression? Could a Marine actually contemplate an act of terrorist revenge at the cost of tearing his own family apart? I won't reveal the answer, but the audience is being asked to contemplate the possibility. We are kept guessing, of course, but this is what we're asked to buy. For me, it's a bridge too far. I can imagine some Marines being quite offended at the show even floating the concept. In this respect, maybe Brody and Mathison are at their core as unreal as the indestructible Jack Bauer in 24.<br /><br />Apart from that problem with the premise, everything proceeds on an even keel, deliberately building the story, the conflict, and the suspense. The plot is very clever. It's escapist entertainment at the peak of the spy genre.<br /><br />Perhaps I also balk at the show's hints of a moral equivalence between our military actions and the actions of terrorists like the Abu Nazir character in Homeland. This is to be expected from the entertainment industry these days, but you don't have to be some sort of jingoist to notice it and be at least a little put off. It's just one more thing you might have to swallow and put out of your mind in order to enjoy the drama.

0316228532|1.0|I loved the HP series and hope this might be as good. There is enough trash out there I was very surprised at the vulgarity she used. I tried to keep an open mind but the trash continued and I gave up after the first 100 pages. The story line itself was OK but just because a novel is 'adult' doesn't mean it has to be that vulgar. Novels for adults do not need to use such language.

B0099G4Y26|5.0|P!nk has really proved herself as an artist over the years and this album shows how she truly has grown within 12 years. It's a album that has a good mix of amped up songs (Blow Me, Here Comes The Weekend, Are We All We Are), love songs (True Love, Just Give Me A Reason), \\"sh*t talkers\\" as P!nk describes them (How Come You're Not Here), and other great songs. I highly recommend getting the Target bonus songs because they are AMAZING (Good Old Days!!!!). Overall, I think this is one of P!nk's best albums and any P!nk fan would love it! 4.7/5! Good job P!nk!

B008Z9YLV2|3.0|So this movie is basically about a once a year tv show, where kids/teens are placed in a dome to fight for their lives for the enjoyment of the public. The last person living wins fame and fortune. That's about all the details I'll give, as to not spoil the movie.<br />Overall it's a decent movie. I don't really understand the hype for this series (Maybe I'm too old to get it). My kids really liked this movie, they had read the book before hand and only complained slightly about the differences. My wife referred to it as remake of the movie \\"Condemned\\" but instead of Stone Cold and other men, they used kids/teens. Throw a love story in there and you have this movie.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|This is an excellent account of that successful mission. It includes plenty of insight into the why and how of the back ground decisions as well as a moment by moment account of the raid on Bin Laden's Paskistani residence.  The author evidently had a challenging job of setting aside his opinions of the politics and media hype surrounding this incredible assignment. Well done. There are hundreds of unanswered questions regarding the complicity of Americas Pakistani Allies, but this would be for another author from inside the world of diplomacy!

I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys family drama and love, history and a great writing.
0374531269|5.0|If you know nothing about child soldiers or the day to day realities of life in a warzone, this is the book to read.<br /><br />While one is happy Ishmael was eventually freed from the battlefield, the tale of his journey to speak at various UN functions about \\"world peace\\" only serve to illustrate the impotence of words alone.<br /><br />Many wars continue today with no easy answers. But it's Ishamael final words in the book that resonate with me the most. He described a, \\"no win\\" riddle given by those in his village. If you did not kill a monkey, it would kill your mother. If you killed it, it would kill your father.<br /><br />Ishmael said if the choice was his, he would have killed the monkey, to prevent it from kill anyone else's parents.<br /><br />I think many would agree.
B003MC5N28|4.0|Pretty good book. Nice plot, excellent description, I totally recommend it. Would have been nice to know a little more about the book before getting it, though through a bit of work on the internet, it's definitely possible to find out more on The Giver. Attached is a link in case anyone is wondering where to learn more:    [...]    However, the link is extremely informative so for anyone who doesn't want to know to much, don't go to this link.    Pretty much, exciting, though sometimes a little bland, but for readers who want a nice bit of reading.
159562015X|5.0|These books were purchased at the recommendation of a Psychology graduate student doing her internship in our hospital department.  The intention was to find a method of engaging our diverse team in an effort to improve teamwork and communication.  These books served as an excellent resource, for both learning more about ourselves as well as our colleages.  The straighforward style and accessible examples of each point made this informative and intersting reading, as well as doing what we had hoped it would do.  I recommend these books for groups, individuals, really anyone who wants to learn more about ourselves or others world views.
0143119680|3.0|I wish I could rate this book 3.5 stars.  I have always enjoyed books about witches, as I find them fascinating, but found this book to be about 150 pages longer than it needed to be.  Some of the historical and scientific aspects were extremely cool to read about - all the references to old scientists and playwrights were great and made me smile.<br /><br />However, there were some parts of the book where the subject matter got really dry and boring; hence my wish that the book was shorter.  I didn't want to skim those parts for fear I'd miss something really important, so this book was a slow read and took me a long time to finish.  The slowness of the first half of the book, and some (to me) unnecessary scientific/historical details are really the only gripes I have about this book, and the only reasons I'm rating it a 3.5.<br /><br />Harkness definitely put an astounding amount of research and time into this novel, and it shows.  There is an amazing amount of detail on every page - you can feel and see everything with crystal clarity from her incredibly descriptive details.  It was like being there in London and New York right along with Diana and Matthew.  I definitely appreciated the author's hard work in that regard.<br /><br />Diana is a very fierce character, even though it doesn't seem like it at first.  Some of the things she has to endure in this book are nothing short of amazing - and she survives.  Her attitude toward her magic was frustrating at first to me because I think it would be really cool to be a powerful witch; but as she learned about her own unknown past through the help of unsuspecting people, it was nice to see her change in amazing ways.<br /><br />Matthew is fantastic and written extremely well.  His character screams the epitome of old world French charm and vampire.  I certainly wouldn't want to ever be on his bad side!  Same with Ysabeau and Marthe.  When Matthew started describing to Diana what to expect when faced with Ysabeau, I was really expecting to hate her guts.  She surprised me.  I found the developing relationship between Ysabeau, Marthe and Diana quite endearing, and a link that Diana had been missing her entire life after the death of her parents.<br /><br />Harkness also put a lot of time into developing her secondary characters, because they all were written very well and didn't feel like afterthoughts.  I found myself attached to them all emotionally in a very strong way, and I cared about each of them and what was going to happen.  The way they all came together and worlds collided in the 2nd half of the book was amazing.  Once I hit the 300 page mark, I just couldn't put the book down.<br /><br />The storyline is just amazing.  If you enjoy reading about witches, vampires and daemons, then this book is definitely one to put time into.  It may take longer to finish because it does get off to a slow start, but the ending is worth all the trouble.  I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading paranormal.  With the cliff-hanger at the end, I can't wait for book 2!!as really expecting to hate her guts.  She surprised me.

B006TJXZ30|3.0|It is a decent ap, but missing a bulk move to a folder.  The reason I got this ap is that the standard Kindle mail ap does not support other folders for Hotmail where I put my old saved mail.  While this ap does support my sub folders, it will only allow me to move emails one at a time.  I can delete in bulk, just not move.  Due to this I find myself going back to the browser version to do this, which makes this ap no better for me than the default Kindle version.  The browser with all their ads makes Hotmail pretty sluggish sometimes so I would like a decent ap to do my mailbox cleanup, but apparently this is not it.<br /><br />Other than that I have had no issues.  Was easy to setup and works fine, just doesn't do what I was looking for.
0385737955|4.0|Holy shuck!  This book was klunking fantastic! :)<br /><br />It started off really great, I absolutely loved all the boys, each one having a really well-written character.  My favorite was learning the \\"new language\\" they had in the Glade. Each one of the Gladers seemed special in their own way, and I loved how orderly they all seemed with their Keepers, managing to come up with their governmental system and still maintaining order and friendship among them, while never giving up that there HAD to be a way out of the Maze.  Day in, day out, working their butts off to simply survive and figure out the way home. Thomas was fantastic, and above all, brave.  The way many Gladers were so skeptical of him, accusing him of all these different things - he had it so differently there than the rest of them.  Hardly ever crying, and just dealing with the lot thrown him.<br /><br />It was really hard for me to put this book down!  I loved the story...most of the way through.  The grievers were just plain SCARY.  And gross. I will admit that towards the end of the book, when the plan surfaces from Thomas's brain about the code and how the maze wasn't solvable, that they had to escape - things got WAY wacked for me.  Talk about pure science fiction.  It was really strange and odd with the computers and the people behind the glass observing them, the Flare, etc.  Just holy klunking weird.<br /><br />But...I'm going to read book 2 because after an ending like that, which isn't really an ending at all, I just have no choice!  It's too weird NOT to know what happens next!  I HAVE to know! :)

B005LAIH2W|5.0|Despite all the negative reviews, being a science fiction fan, I rented it.<br />I am sure glad I did.<br />This was fun and entertainment at its finest.<br />The story was quite interesting and the movie was well paced.<br />The romance between Dejah and Carter was exciting, energetic and believable.<br />One of the best science fiction romances I have ever seen.<br />All of the main protagonists were multidimensional and excellently portrayed.<br />Thus I enjoyed and cared about them.<br />That is often lacking in science fiction movies but not this one.<br />The visuals were stunning and the music moving.<br />I laughed, I was choked up and at the end I wanted more.<br />Unfortunately there probably won't be anymore because this movie wasn't well received.<br />If I had a million years I could not explain that.<br />Having rented it, I am now on Amazon to buy it, as it definitely will be in my collection<br />of classics.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|With this coming out as a movie and my two teen daughters being interested in seeing it, I wanted to read it first. I read this in one sitting, truly engaged with the author's voice as an awkward teenager coming of age, trying to figure things out with limited exposure and little judgement. There are some very adult themes in this story, so reading it helped me decide whether to take my daughters (12 and 15) to see it. The adult themes are the only reason I give it 4 stars so that folks know it's an excellent weekend read and take time to find out why. When I went to buy it, I didn't find any reviews mentioning the sexual elements and drug use along with other adult themes that could be difficult for some to read/view.

0307279189|5.0|I don't often read non-fiction, but this is one of my favorite books of all time.  Inspiring, moving, intense, insightful, it is downright awesome.  I bought an extra copy to circulate amongst family and friends!
B009CPJHY4|4.0|My wife and I missed this in the theater, so we looked forward to seeing it on-demand.  We weren't disappointed.  The characters are well acted and nuanced (some slightly more than others).  The Indian characters are not ignored, in terms of the above.  The basic plot is that a number of older adults are forced to move to India, for financial reasons.  Most of them dread it, but adapt quite well, pretty much.  Each character or couple has its own background and plot line, which intersect to some interesting effects.<br />This movie will probably appeal more to adults than teens, but not because of any fault of the movie!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was very well written. kept my interest. not what i expected at all. worth the read and now to begin book 2. yay
B008HK3S9K|4.0|This is a solidly built little slip-cover case, in a deep mulberry color with stylized flowers. My first impression of it, is that it is a study and attractive. The exterior texture is very appealing, and it is well-padded. The stiching is very solid. To insert my kindle, I had to remove its existing cover, and squeeze it inside this carrier. The padded book-style cover was too bulky to keep on while placing inside this case. The inside is fairly soft red material.<br /><br />The red interior just does not go with the pretty purple outside.  Bright cherry red and magenta are just not good together.  The interior could be softer. The case closes with Velcro, however, the Velcro is very oddly applied. There are two bottom Velcro  tabs, but the top has an entire strip. It still shuts- but the extra Velcro seems odd.<br /><br />This is a decent, nice, presentable case for those who want to use their kindle bare, or with a skin.  I felt aesthetically there could be a few improvements... Such as a different interior color, better Velcro.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|one other reviewer wrote that this was like forrest gump, which is agreat compairson. Easy to read, historically clever. A little macabre, and the main character for that reason is not all that likeable, but a pleasurable book nonetheless

0316228532|4.0|I'm a die-hard Harry Potter fan, and the greatest parts of that series include the quality of language, that it's entertaining and readable without being silly or simple, and the way Rowling creates complex, compelling characters--they have secrets, and I need to know what they are. Those same qualities come across all the way through The Casual Vacancy, which feels real and true, and it made me think about the characters and their relationships, why I did or didn't like them, and what their motivations are for their actions. While I was reading it, I kept thinking that I felt like I shouldn't enjoy it--it was upsetting and unnerving at times, and none of the characters was entirely likeable--but I totally did; in fact, I found it hard to put down. The plot isn't a sweeping, action-packed epic, but the subtlety with which Rowling crafts this small English town held my attention and kept me thinking after it was over.<br /><br />To be fair, I highly doubt I would have read this book were it not for its author, but I'm glad I did.

0525952926|3.0|While this is an entertaining read, it just didn't draw me in like some of his best work has.<br /><br />This is a wide ranging look at the rise of Hitler thru the beginnings of the Cold War.  Mr. Follett looks at the rise of Hitler through the eyes of a German Socialist family and what Hitler did to the those who opposed him - mainly intimidation, but very effective.  While he doesn't look at the Holocaust directly, he does look at what the Nazi's did to the mentally and physically handicapped.<br /><br />When he does get to WW II there is surprising little combat.  He does have one of his families in the middle of Pearl Harbor when the attack occurs (civilians no less on the way to breakfast on the Arizona) and one of his main characters gets involved with London during the Blitz.  He also has one of his characters at Midway on the Yorktown and finally a brief scene in Normandy where two of the characters who are vying for the affections of one of the main female characters meet as one of them dies.  There is a little too much coincidence going on for me.<br /><br />He does explore the social mores of the western societies thru the eyes of an interracial couple and a closeted gay man.<br /><br />One other nitpicking problem that I had is that all of the conservative characters are not nice people - almost villains, and the all the socialist are good guys.  The politics was a little heavy handed for me.

B0083SBJXS|5.0|Now as far as the movie itself goes, I personally thought this was the best of the summer. It had everything that would make a superhero movie right: action, adventure, story, comedy, etc... I am aware that there are many Nolan nut-huggers out there that purposely try retaliate by coming onto avengers forums and discussion boards just to start some kind of rivalry that fairly pointless and inane. Don't get me wrong, as much as I like Nolan's work, this review is NOT for people who are clearly set on trying to prove that the batman series is better.<br /><br />As far as summer blockbusters go, there is PLENTY of stiff competition to be had. Competing with the the well respected Batman series directed by Nolan as well as the newly revamped Spiderman is no easy task. Assembling a cast like this with big name stars has been done MANY times. A lot of them fail. This one surely does NOT. You would think that each star would want his/her share of the limelight, but this movie interweaves the story so intricately, that the character interactions are seamless. There were scenes where I was so absorbed in the story, that I didn't blink. The story may not be most original, but who cares?!?!? It was highly enjoyable and the story was coherent. The dialogue between characters were very believable because not everyone gets along with everybody. People clash in personalities and it is reflected in the assembling of the Avengers. It is working toward a common goal that brings them to work together as a single unit and process they go through is nothing short of magical.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie and would hope people can put aside their preconceived notions to give this a try. I WILL be getting the blu-ray!
B0099G4Y26|5.0|Pink is one of my favorite artists!  She never fails to surprise me.  She stays true to her sound, and is fun, and enjoyable.  My favorites on this album are Try, and Walk of shame.  I also like Blow me one last kiss.
B005H5H3LW|3.0|Space Battleship Yamato- The Final Battle was a very enjoyable live action movie. More so if you were a fan of the Anime T.V. series from the 70s. The movie moves along quite quickly and glosses over points that a new viewer might miss if not already familiar with the story and characters. However the overriding theme of hope, duty and self sacrifice had me misting up several times throughout the movie.<br />The producers failed to give me one long beauty shot of the Yamato flying in space.<br />My standard DVD gave me a clear picture and the subtitles were easily readable. My video hung up in the last five minutes and I had to restart the player to watch the ending smoothly.<br />I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to fans of the Anime.
B009AJDDQU|4.0|Hello,<br /><br />I might be in the minority here , but I loved this movie.  I am a huge fan of the Alien Universe and can't get enough.  All movies have issues, but only some deserve to have these issues overlooked.  When you get down to the big picture, this was a movie that was needed to revive this awesome franchise from the ashes left by the travesty that is the AVP movies< Predators was awesome :)>.  Who knows , once this trilogy is brought back into the forefront we might get proper \\"Alien\\" movies again.  I would even let myself get facehugged to bring this to fruition.<br /><br />Buy this movie :)

0805095535|5.0|Winter Journal by Paul Auster is a reflection on life, past, present, and future. Having just turned 63 my self, I related to Mr. Auster's sense of humanity and spirit as I read Winter Journal. He reflects on his early youth growing up in a New Jersey suburb with vivid dream like memories. As we all know, time waits for no one, and we follow his life through adulthood. For me, reading Winter Journal became a reflection on my own life. I realized that ageing is just part of the process of living; it's not how old we are, but what we learn from life. For a positive life experience, I recommend reading Winter Journal.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read WOOL immediately after finishing Collins' THE HUNGER GAMES trilogy. Howey's writing, characters, and story are every bit as creative and believable as the latter, which is a tour de force of the genre in my opinion. Howey drags us under the earth into a world of complex characters, real emotions, and brilliant plotting, to reveal humanity confronting extinction. As an author I am a harsh critic of other's work, but in this case, I stand in awe of Howey's skillful mastery of the genre and his ability to deliver on all the best things that science fiction brings to literature - escapism, imagination, and hope. I have since read everything else that Mr. Howey has published to date and I can confirm...a star is born.<br /><br />I can't wait for the movie.

0307592731|5.0|From page one to the end of the book, the author kept me in rapture and awe as she backpacked \\"to find herself\\".. I live in the Mojave/Tehachapi mountain areas where Ms. Strayed began her journey, so I could relate with the hot dusty desert conditions she described. I had also backpacked once in my lifetime to an area she was in, and had overloaded my backpack, as she did and was rescued by a male friend as she was. From that point on, she and I are not alike. I would have turned back at the first sign of weariness or hunger, but the author vowed to finish her trek. As I also learned much about myself with my experience, she used the time alone to reflect on what was important to her and what to leave behind, literally, as in the books she took with her and figuratively, in her poor decisions in her past life.<br /><br />I was unable to stop reading, and stayed up most of the night to finish the book, never having done this before while reading any book. I was hooked until the last page. My son called while I was reading, and my enthusiasm spilled over to our conversation and his backpacking. Needless to say, I am buying the audio version for him, as he and any others interested in backpacking, will find the descriptions of the Pacific Crest Trail very informative. Much is to be learned in the items she took and didn't need and items she didn't take and needed; a must reading for those you love who might be beginning the adventure of backpacking.<br /><br />Her unflinching honesty set me back in parts, but being a bad girl being redeemed is a courageous part of her telling of her saga. Leaving out any of the story would have left out a major part of who she was and who she became on the trail, experiencing things only a few of us may encounter in life. Using these experiences as lessons only made her a better person and left me with lessons on how to persevere, how to drop emotional baggage and how to overcome spirit-breaking trials.<br /><br />Stunning, brilliant, evocative, funny, sublime,so many adjectives to describe the book and the author. I heartily recommend WILD for a gift to yourself and to anyone on your gift list. From teenager up to 80+, this book will leave an imprint on each of their hearts.evocative, funny, sublime,so many adjectives to describe the book and the author.

B00846REIS|5.0|Wasn't sure if I could get pulled into a story and become so attached to the characters as with the 50 Shades trilogy, but this book did not disappoint.  Sylvia Day did a great job of creating a world where Eva could find Gideon and their lives would change forever.  Trying to face and overcome their past nightmares and be able to have a future together.  I had to wait two days to download the second book and learn of all the unexpected drama that was waiting just around the corner.  I got pissed and cried several times while reading, but in the end they were tears of joy. I wanted more.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I love this game. It is very addictive. I would have given it 5 stars, but you have to wait too long to get more coins once you use up your supply. (One every 30 seconds or a full supply after several hours). Try it...if it's free, well worth the price.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I enjoyed this so much from beginning to end.  It is funny, poignant, and very, very human.  The wonderful cast (how can you miss with these great stars?) play a variety of different types of personalities adjusting to a new way of life in their later years.  Some are willing to adapt, some are tentative, and some resistant to change.  India and its people are so beautiful. It is great to see how another culture interacts with older people; such warmth, courtesy and forbearance even when they aren't particularly treated well by those who are visiting their country.  If you want to watch a movie that feels very, very good and positive, this is definitely one to see.  A real JOY!
1455508977|3.0|On my continuation of expanding my reading genre I found \\"The Lucky One\\" by Nicholas Sparks. Although I know if his writing and from the movie, The Notebook ( and liked it), I I've never read his books.<br /><br />The main character in \\"The Lucky One\\" is Logan Thibault, a US Marine who has done several tours in Iraq and his home to start a new life and leave the ugliness of war behind him. He seems like a decent enough guy who's in search of \\"something\\" as he  who travels across the country with his faithful German Sheppard Zeus. From the back of the book cover the reader knows Logan is in search of a mysterious woman in a photograph he believes to have been his lucky charm during his service in Iraq.<br /><br />It was an easy, no-big thrill read that my lazy eyes could drift over. I didn't get thrilled about any one particular part - antagonist is Keith Clayton a small town sheriff and ex-husband of the mysterious woman (Elizabeth \\"Beth\\") in the photo and father of their ten year-old son. He's a bully who Logan outwits at every chance making Clayton look duh dumb.  Here and there when Logan and Beth hook-up and they work through their private love/emotional issues there is a few hot dates, but nothing to write home about.<br /><br />Sparks is a minimalist in his writing and we get the scene and characters easily, some we can warm up to a bit more than others. Personally, I like Zeus. He had a lot of character and more than most in the book.  And Nora, the grandmother to Beth, she's an alright old lady who isn't afraid to give her opinions away easily.<br />It's a journey to bring closure for Logan and to understand why he made it out of the desert while so many buddies didn't. He found what he wanted and Beth, his focus, didn't stand a chance. The ending was so nice.  A good feel story where the guy gets his gal and all is well. That's okay. I like happy-ever-after stories.<br /><br />In a pinch I might read another Nicholas Sparks. He is a good writer of this kind of easy-read-love-win-family kind of story.of easy-read-love-win-family kind of story.

0525953728|5.0|I have read several seal books and all are good reading.  But, this book didn't quite spark my interest as much as the other books have.  Don't know if it is because of knowing more about the killing of OBL from the news and the other books I've read on seals. However, there are always some things to learn, and if you have never read a seal book this will give you a good idea of the training involved and the missions they are involved on.  I admire the seals.  I am too old now, but wonder if I was young if I could endure the training to become a seal.  Wish I had to opportunity to find out.
B00005NP04|5.0|All went well.  Got what I wanted when they said it would be here. Product was as advertised.<br /><br />Would use them again.
0316228532|5.0|Of course all the reactions that are in all the other reviews of this book happened for me.  I was delighted that JK Rowling Was going to be publishing another book.  I was sad and unbelieving and hopeful and worried when I heard that it would not be part of the Harry Potter universe.  I am after all a functioning, adult woman, who just happens to also be a major Potterhead.<br />  I actually didn't start out loving Harry Potter.  That seems unreal to me now, but I remember thinking that the characters were stereotyped and the story itself was unoriginal and merely a rewriting of old stories.  Then I fell in love and never looked back.  So I trusted Rowling, and when I started the new book, I was willing to keep going even though I did not really like the Casual Vacancy.  I still didn't like it by 100 pages in and I was having a hard time keeping the characters straight.  The book has no clear central character and the view point changes from one section to another and back again so you never get to know enough about one group of people in the first introduction to have them firmly in your mind the next time they appear.  It was a confusing feeling like the first week in a new town when you always wonder, \\"have I met this person before, should I recognize some details or is this all new?\\"<br />  I spoke to other people who were reading the book and found that we shared some of the same feelings and had some interest in the same characters, but agreed that they were not exactly people you would \\"like\\" or want to know in real life.  But \\"Real Life\\" is what this book is all about.  I found myself recognizing situations and people in a way that was a bit uncomfortable and gritty.  I flinched at some of the brutal detail and the language, but after 23 years teaching children and meeting their families, especially those in Severely Handicapped classes, none of the brutality sounded unreal or exaggerated.  JK Rowling's new book is not a magical escape but rather a confrontation with the part of town a lot of people prefer to avoid.<br />  By the time I finished the final chapter, and turned the back cover, and glanced once more at the author blurb, the final line of the back flap stood up and slapped me awake.  \\"She supports a wide range of causes and is the founder of Lumos, which works to transform the lives of disadvantaged children.\\"<br /><br />  Then I saw it, and I realized this book is very similar to Harry Potter after all.<br />  There is even a faint reference to Harry Potter in one line on page 81, \\" . . . once, (she dreamed of it, still), a child who had been locked in a cupboard for five days by his psychotic stepfather.\\"<br /><br />  So this book is, like Harry Potter, about fear and prejudice against those who are different, and about children who are unwanted, or even if wanted, neglected through ignorance and desperation.  There is much about Harry and Krystal Weedon that is similar, but then with Harry there was an owl, and a magic school and a quiddich team and friends with powers and hope.  There were teachers who saw potential and nurtured it.  For Krystal there is no magic owl, and the rowing team breaks up when the book begins with the one adult who saw her potential, dropping dead. Her peer friends were also 16 year old powerless foster kids. Life without the magic, but still trying to show that disadvantaged children are really there, and we all need to stop looking away.  Let there be light.

0525953728|5.0|Excellent Read. I have read many books from and about Navy Seals. They all begin with their time in BUDS and the trials and tribulations of that experience. No Easy Day cut through all the preliminary info about SEAL life and went straight into the story after a short synopsis of the authors life. I couldn't put it down. I can't wait for the movie. I just hope the movie sticks to this story and doesn't politicize it. I recomend this book for all Americans to read.
B006RXQ1L6|5.0|Awesome movie. This movie was high quality and I loved loved loved every part of the movie. Definite buy in future!
B008PNBU30|4.0|Three Days Grace is one of those bands that will never release an album with the ability to top One-X... Transit of Venus, in my opinion, is a close second though.. It exceeds the debut and especially Life Starts Now.... I must also point out the rather odd cover of Michael Jackson's \\"Give Into Me\\".... They did a pretty good job of it....
B0068PHS5Q|5.0|A great read, kept my interest all through the story. Very well written, loved the twist in the tale and the happy ending. What a mad family, just goes to show you never know what goes on in families !!
B007XNAOS0|2.0|Baroness is trying to make sludge metal a popular genre of music. I preordered the vinyl expecting a progression from \\"Blue Record\\" but I got a second rate alternative sound. Sure there is a few decent songs on the record, but tons of filler. Even to take out the filler songs, the others sound very generic and follow the simple chorus, verse, chorus formula. Yellow and Green is best categorized by the color of vomit.
B007TK77QE|5.0|I loved this book.  It was slow starting and took a while to figure out the characters, but its gritty and well written and the story will stay with you long after you have put the book down.
B004XN3FHA|5.0|Looks like a car mounted spot light at night on turbo. You can light up the whole side of a house 500 feet away, so brightly that you see sharp shadows cast from tree limbs on it. If you want to impress people with the terminator of all lights, this is it! The next to lowest setting will handle most lighting needs. This is a very high quality light and I love it! I bought it to take on my boat. I use enelope rechargable batteries. I compared the brightness of rechargeable vs alkaline and I could not see any difference. Use it like the batteries are free, then just swap out the set of 8 AA's and recharge them later. Leave the tail cap loose when stored as all of these multi function lights have a slight memory draw when not in use. Any light that remembers it's last setting is drawing a slight amount. The regulator functions very well, light stays bright as the batteries run down. This light has a glass lense, O-ring seals, all machined aluminum housing with a nice durable black finish. Physically this light is the same size as a 2D flashlight, but packs 20 times the punch. They make a new model with about 60 more lumens for more money, probably not enough lumens to make a difference.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I had lunch with my 17 yr. old grandson just after finishing this.  My opinion was that it's a thoughtful piece about the author's experience in the SEALS, how he decided to enter, the operations he was part of, the sacrifices made for country, and, dirth of contact with family and friends when a SEAL.<br /><br />After the first half of the book, the remainder centered on the people involved, (none identified except by first name [often changed]), the author's frustration with the snail's pace of the operation because of Washington Beauracracy. It was not a page turner that I was anxious to get back to if interrupted.  The operation itself was chaotic (of course) and, yet, almost mundane in the reporting.<br /><br />It was interesting to read that all proceeds will go to the families of fallen SEALS and note the author's opinion of OBH as a coward who encouraged many to commit suicide and yet he did not even try to take that route himself.<br /><br />My opinion, shared with my grandson, who plans to go into Journalism, was it is an account, written by an amateur.  It is a 'short read' and probably worth the time to get an insight into the end of the devil OBL.<br /><br />Grace Kelly

B008QE9XD2|2.0|I really wanted to like this and for the first half hour or so, I did. But things went down hill fast for me once the silly comedy started kicking in.<br /><br />I'm a huge Dark Shadows fan and I was hoping for something on the more darker, mysterious side. Heck, I would of even excepted dry humour here and there. But, leave it to good ol' Tim Burton to upstage the classic storyline with his usual flamboyant style of gay candy art and silly hijinks. Needless to say, I was far from impressed with Edward Scissorhands.<br /><br />Why, at the very beginning of the movie, before the opening credits, do they have the brief chapter,(that explains Barnabas's tragic life), be so dark and chilling, and then later, flip it over like a hot pancake and turn into a hot mess of a joke? It just makes no sense to me.<br /><br />The sex scene between Barnabas and Angelique (flying around the office as they rip each other's clothes off, destroying all the furniture) was just way 'too over the top'. It came off as a 'Naked Gun' parody. Not only that, we just saw (!!) the same exact scene (though, left more to the imagination) in the latest, Twilight movie. (Where Edward and Bella make love on their honeymoon, leaving the room destroyed.) Both films came out around the same time. Didn't anyone notice, in Hollywood, that the joke had just been done?<br /><br />And don't get me started on Alice Cooper singing under a disco ball during the big party scene. Talk about the final nail in the coffin. If I wanted to watch a vampire movie with a funny disco scene, I'd rather be watching Jim Carrey and Lauren Hutton in, 'Once Bitten' dancing to the tune of, \\"Hands off! He belongs to me!\\" Now that's what I call, a really funny scene. And, hot, too. (the dance scene in 'Fright Night' with Chris Sarandon and Amanda Bearse, was cool, too!)<br /><br />But,wait! There IS something that I liked very much about the Dark Shadows movie. The opening credits! Of all things! Go figure.<br /><br />I love the song, 'Nights in White Satin' performed by The Moody Blues, which plays during Vicki's train ride to Collinwood. Oh-My-God! It's so neat! I actually went to the movies, twice, just to 'experience' this scene again.<br /><br />It was a real 'goose bumpy' moment for me. For days, I couldn't get the movie's opening out of my head. It's really a great choice song for such a perfect, somber opening. Especially once we go inside the train to meet Victoria Winters, who looks pale and slightly nervous. (that's when the song begins to, quietly whistle, in the background) Aaah! Very nice. Someone was really on the ball here; I love how the music just seems to, float along, with the train as it traveles through the open valley ways. Incredible. Magical. Dreamlike, and, kinda scary. That's the tone that I wished the movie would of stayed with. But,<br /><br />...if you like tongue in cheek horror movies like 'Death Becomes Her','Eight legged freaks' 'My Demon Lover' 'The Vampire Killers' 'Haunted Honeymoon' and 'Love at First Bite', you'll probably enjoy this. Especially if you don't like your horror, strait up and raw. Like I do.<br /><br />So, I give 'Dark Shadows' two stars. Mostly because of the opening credits over the train ride, and, Michelle Pfeiffer. She's always a pleasure to watch. She is so hot in Grease 2, it's not even funny!<br /><br />And, in the meantime, I love you Grayson Hall, and miss you! Thanx for making 'Dark Shadows' a wonderful viewing experience! (even though you often forget your lines) And, oh yeah, long live, 'The House of, and the Night of...Dark Shadow' movies. In my opinion, those films are the real deal. They just came out on DVD. Check them out, just for nostalgic purposes! Make Barnabas and Willie proud!  KEVIN BRIAN

1451648537|4.0|I've read a lot about Steve Jobs before I read his biography. Articles, reviews, commentaries, a book. I've also seen his product presentations and have followed the rise, fall and rise of the brand. The biography served to fill all the knowledge gaps that I had and pieced his life and accomplishment, his character and personality together. For once, we know the man behind the brand not only as an innovator, but also a human just like any of us. For once, you could get to the reasons why he used to do or behave in a certain way. You learn a lot in the process of reading the biography, but you also get to wonder about the sacrifices that each person takes for a higher purpose. The book is rich but is sometimes repetitive and could have been condensed to a shorter version with more impact. it is surprising throughout, though, how people were able to forgive and move along, such is human nature so rich, yet so complicated.
B009AHWLHE|5.0|I am a bit biased as I have loved almost every single thing to come out of this series (that Capcom made, not Paul W. S.

B000FC2L1E|5.0|This story is so well told that it moves from the page directly to your senses. I can assure you each book in the series is worth reading again. For romance readers, history fans and lovers of well-told stories, this is another delightful offering from Ms. Gabaldon.

0393338827|5.0|As co-author of [[ASIN:B009MHDPCC How Wall Street Rips You Off - and what you can do to defend yourself]] and a paralegal in a law firm representing abused investors, The Big Short was highly recommended to me from many securities attorneys who represent investors.  Michael Short is a favorite author of mine, so the fact that I was impressed with this book is no surprise.  The book provides details and names of how and why our economy was able to free fall due to the greed and corruption on Wall Street. If more people would react to this book, th 99% might have a chance of getting more accomplished to protect investors from the insiders who rule this empire. Excellent reading by an outstanding author.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|Loved this book!  I thought it was a powerful account of what words and the ability to read and write well do for society.  Things we take for granted, or learn and refine reluctantly.  Also a reminder of what humans are capable of and how a movement can get out of control.
0525953728|5.0|Very interesting book.  Easy to read.  Finished it in one day.  My husband also read it and he is ex-military.  He loved it and would recommend it to anyone who wants to know about the SEALS 6 team
B0076UXKDG|4.0|First off, I bought the Meike grip because the Nikon MB-D12 was twice what the Nikon grip for my D700 cost and I figured that most of the Chinese products I have bought in the recent past, were of good quality and for about $56, it was a good bet.  Wrong!<br /><br />It worked initially during testing, so I felt good about my decision. Today (second use) shooting elk in Rocky Mountain NP, first shot attempt, the camera indicated no battery. I pulled the battery out of the grip, looked fine, re-inserted, worked for 3 or 4 shots but now the elk had his head down in the grass, then the grip failed again, in the same manner. This failure pattern continued - every time I stopped shooting and then prepared to take another shot, the same failure occurred. I repeatedly lost the best shot because of the battery pack failing. Why didn't I take the grip off? Because I was so ticked off that I just didn't think of it until I was on my way home!  $56 is no deal when the thing doesn't work!<br /><br />Tonight, I ordered the Nikon grip and expect it will function perfectly, just as all my other Nikon products have done. I would like to think that there is a good technical reason for the Nikon grip being so expensive but this kind of pricing is usually the result of a marketing decision. I decided that what I really needed was not to have any concern when I was about to take a shot that would never come my way again. I really hate paying nearly $400 for the Nikon grip, but in the end, I want the image and I absolutely want a grip, so there really is no choice.<br /><br />Four stars, because cost, in my view, is a real part of the product.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Fun and challenging game.  I like that it has a harder version or an easier mode where you can use the hints more often.
B005LAIHSG|3.0|Overall Snow White and the Huntsman is an average film, with good and bad mixed throughout.<br /><br />Obviously the good has to start with Charlize Theron's Evil Queen Ravenna, which of all the \\"main\\" characters has the best character development and story arc for the entire film.  The makeup, special effects, and cinematography of the film are outstanding as seen in the aging of Ravenna throughout the film as well as the majority of the fight scenes throughout the film.<br /><br />The bad has to start with both Snow White and the Huntsman, which turned out to be a waste of the acting talents of Kristen Stewart and Chris Hemsworth.  Both title characters were lacking in terms of their individual character development and frankly their relationship to one another, especially the romantic one emphasized after the poison apple.  Going hand-in-hand with this underdevelopment is the all-over-the-place plot this film's plot has along unexplainable details (like the Dark Forest being evil that opposes Ravenna instead of being in league with her; the inclusion of James as another love interest that has a better romantic set up than with the Huntsman; the weird mixture of pagan and Christian elements that at first seem opposed than working together than totally forgotten; why Ravenna starts aging at the particular moment she does; and etc, etc, etc).<br /><br />You might be asking why I began this review by calling this film average when I seem to have more bad than good.  Well this film has just enough to keep one entertained from beginning to end, however there was so much wasted potential that was either just missed or mishandled that if you start thinking about it then the film becomes a drag.  If I had been able to give this 2 1/2 stars I would have, but I couldn't go far enough to give this film 2 stars.
B001RNO7BM|4.0|I love the quality and looks of the shoe, and I found it fits true to size (I regularly wear an 11M and the 11M I ordered was a perfect length.) There was one problem. The forefoot area of the shoe was too wide. When trying to \\"make do\\" by tightening the laces enough to secure my forefoot, the leather started to \\"buckle\\" over my toes/metatarsals.

031603441X|4.0|When reading a book by one of the founding members of the Rolling Stones and a true Rock legend, you expect the wild stories of sex, drugs and, of course, Rock 'N' Roll but, it's the unexpected that makes Keith Richard's autobiography so enjoyable. To begin with, the fact that a man renown as one of music's hardest partiers remembers his life in such stunning detail is entertaining in itself, but, in his defense, according to his book, he has been clean for quite some time now. What really made this story of Richard's climb from a humble beginning in post war England to one of the greatest rock star's in history is just how knowledgeable and passionate he is about music. He names what seems like hundreds of musicians he admired or was influenced by, giving each his or her credit regardless of how famous or obscure. His book is not only a tale of a fascinating life but, a virtual lesson in the evolution of Jazz and Blues into Rock. Richard's describes in detail how he developed his unique style of guitar playing, as well as how one of the greatest bands in Rock was formed. And the stories of just how many music legends this man has played with are breathtaking. Whether he's chronicling the rise of the Stones or his days in Jamaica jamming with the Rasta's years before Reggae exploded onto the rest of the world, Richard's book is an entertaining history of modern music. Sure we also hear about his many loves and his friendship/feud with fellow Stone Mick Jagger but, it is the rich wealth of music knowledge and the passion for that music that really makes us love this book and the man who wrote it. A must read for music fans of all kinds.

B008LSVLVA|5.0|The video and audio production is as good as it gets. The Blu-ray is amazing. The music and musicians are simply sick. As a musician myself, I was blown away at the live renditions of the music. All of the guys played perfectly and took the music to another level from the studio recordings. A must have for any open-minded fan of music.

I have the previous five seasons on dvd and they are all crystal clear unlike season 6, so buyer beware.

B00932A2MC|5.0|Battleship is a well thought out and constructed movie that originally I did not plan to see but am glad that I did. Incredible special effects and surprisingly gripping during the entire length of the movie.  Very enjoyable.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|As a relative novice (1 ebook published, a second on the way) who uses Word, I found this to be one of the best of several guides I have purchased.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I loved siege hero. I wasn't able to load it on my nexis 7 but it is great much better than angry birds
B003ZFCBJ0|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever!!! Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth go together so great!!! I love this movie!!
B0083GOPSG|4.0|Chronicle was very entertaining and interesting movie for the most part but I felt got somewhat outlandish towards the finale.
0553582038|2.0|I'm less than halfway through the book, but at about page 300 recognized this was nowhere near as good as the first three books.  In fact, it was crap.<br /><br />While I haven't finished the book, looking at reviews confirms this is a piece of crap book.  Anyone associated with the publishing of this book (including the author) should be ashamed.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|I like this game, it's like Tetris with numbers.  It gives me a good mental workout and is a great way to pass a little time while waiting at the doctor's office.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Strayed was spectacularly ill prepared for her PCT hike but like so many redemption stories, she prevailed. It is a compelling story, well told, and is intermingled with events that took her on this quest. Her narrative never lags and her observations are clear and keen.
B0098VYKSA|5.0|Snow White and the Huntsman is an incredible movie that is captivating from beginning to end.  Although a very familiar tale, this take on Snow White is very interesting and leads you more into the dark side of black magic and withcraft.  The special effects were exceptional and added significantly to the mood and atmosphere created by the Producer and Director.
B001NZEHMS|3.0|This album contains several excellent tunes, like Rhymin & Stealin, Posse in effect, Don't sleep 'till Brooklyn, apart from the smash hit Fight for your Right. But it also has weaker tunes, like Slow Ride, Girls, and Brass Monkey. Altogether the album is O.K., but not a must.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|The DVD is the best version of the concert, and has the best sounds and visuals. With 33 songs, it is totally<br />awesome with length and variety. The CDs have no links, just back to back music, and the DVD has some pretty good<br />comments from Paul, as well as some great shots of some awesome ladies, women, wow, if thats what they look like in<br />New York, I Love NY for sure !! Anyway, Paul seemed to appreciate the screaming, and the women there, saying he knew he shouldnt go there, but he did, and it was very Good !! The music was taken from 3 nights, but at least they<br />admit it !! Anyway, all I can say is the audio is superb. I have listened to this multiple times on ipod, CD in the<br />car, and on my surround sound; its a bonanza. And Alec Baldwin does a great job as narrator ( just thought I would<br />mention), and Billy Joels rendition of the song he steps in on is great. For the price, its  great value. It took<br />me a while to get the set, and I started wanting to get this set when it was priced somewhat higher, but at the<br />current price or higher, it is well worth it.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Very original. I could not put the book down. I read straight through it until the wee hours of the morning. His books always have a message and are uplifting.
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|When I found out that JPJ was finally available on the Android I think I remembered letting out a \\"WOOOOOO!!!!\\" that could probably be heard by every person in our 3 floor apartment building. In short, I was stoked. I'd been playing for weeks on my friend's iPhone until I made it a mission to get it on my own Motorola Triumph. When I finally got it, I spent about a week's worth of playing and finishing missions and buying gadgets. After that initial week, I find that 5 gadgets I already purchased and earned were locked again! This also meant that the higher level items I was supposed to have unlocked were relocked. I ended up losing at least 30,000 coins. IDK, I was pretty dissapointed at all that time wasted. I hope Half-Brick gets it together....
B006BAEQB2|5.0|[[ASIN:B006BAEQB2 The Kingmaker's Daughter (The Cousins' War)]] is the story of Anne Neville, daughter of the Earl of Warwick, wife of Richard III, and Queen of England.<br /><br />I loved every moment of this story from the first paragraph that drew me to the characters until the last paragraph that drew her last breath. I was amazed by the twists and turns of puppetry, pawns, and loyalty. The plot was flawless. The characters were rich. The story was quick-moving, and I could not put it down until it was finished. I am continually amazed by the powerful women of the time who essentially had no power.<br /><br />Recommended to historical fiction lovers, any lover of strong female characters, and any fans of the history of the English monarchy.
0689877803|5.0|The books were in great condition.  My 12 year old son loves this series.  He's already on the 3rd book.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Oh that's right I went there.<br />If she had an orgasm on roller skates I was prepared to remove all of my Olivia Newton John songs from my Ipod.<br />I can't explain it but I kept picturing the lead female character as Chris Farley in a wig.
0062086529|5.0|I bought this book for a memorial book drive in honor of Erik McKenny, who lost his battle with Leukemia one month before his 4th birthday.  His parents wanted to celebrate Erik's life and decided to collect as many books as possible in the month of October.  I purchased this book in addition to 3 others from my 4 children in memory of Erik.  The books that are being collected will be donated to  Walt Disney Pavilion at Florida Hospital for Children. This is the hospital where Erik was treated. In the time that Erik spent there, the book selection present for the children to read all seemed like things picked out of the bottom of a bargain bin. Erik always had the best books and his family would like to bring that to the hospital. We welcome books suitable to all children, from babies to teenagers, girls and boys. Please help us collect an amazing legacy to be presented to the hospital in Erik's honor.<br /><br />Here is the link to their wishlist which is linked to their shipped address as well:<br />http://www.amazon.com/registry/wishlist/36JMFZRDMQHV2/ref=cm_wl_rlist_go_o_C-5
B008G12ERC|5.0|After hearing the single, \\"Madness\\", Muse honestly had me worried that they were going to release another experimental dubstep-rock album. I like both genres, both they are not a terribly good mix, IMO. However, while Muse definitely incorporated electronic/synth/dubstep elements into this album, they did it differently from other bands that have done it in the past (Korn, Linkin Park) so that the electronic parts didn't overwhelm, or in some cases, completely replace, the rock band that they really are. In other words, Muse has electronic and house influences in this album, but they use them to achieve huge, epic-sounding songs much like they have done for the entirety of their careers. This is why, unlike the previously mentioned bands that have tried similar experimental elements, I wholeheartedly support Muse's incorporation of dubstep/electronic into their music. Keep rocking guys.<br /><br />P.S. - My favorite songs are Supremacy, Panic Station, Survival, and Big Freeze. Personally, I think Big Freeze is near the top of the list of all-time most grandiose songs from Muse.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Fabulous....can't wait for Season 3!  You will love the characters, the scenery, the history, the humor.  Maggie Smith is purely delightful

B008MEM24S|5.0|fun. easy for children.  my 6 year old mastered it without too much frustration. well worth it.  there you are., Perry

B007SGM084|1.0|Such drivel. Such cliché! I was on the verge of destroying my Kindle. What an awful trite series this was.<br />Note to self: try a sample first!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I was anxious to read this - and it's only the 2nd book (Fall of Giant's being the first) that I have paid as much for on my Kindle.  It's worth it to be able to carry it around with me and read at lunch or whenever possible.  Extraordinary characters and insight into human nature.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I played day after day because it was so much fun trying to collect the prizes. but once I collected the four whistles, getting every thing else was super easy. the whistles allow you to collect prizes that go into the gutters, so getting other prizes and collecting their sets to use their abilities made the game to easy and boring.<br /><br />sure getting the whistles takes awhile (I got the last one at around level 45) but once you do its no fun anymore and keep in mind leveling is easy aswell.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|An interesting read about introverts and how they fit in this highly extroverted world. The author didn't just point out the problems but guided the reader to possible solutions. Although this is a subject I have long been interested in, mainly because I know I am an introvert, I found many more instances of how this personality aspect playa out against everyday life. Such as, I know I am always tired when socializing, or talking on the phone, it takes a lot of effort to be outgoing when I prefer to be at home writing or reading. But to have that very problem pointed out and how one must work into outings safe havens of quiet, even just a trip to the rest room to stop the constant barrage of stimulus. I know I have done that often, but now I don't feel so bad about it. It is necessary for my own health to try and find my own center and quiet.<br /><br />I also found the way the author pointed to certain societies and how they are raised to respect the quiet one over the aggressive one a concept I hadn't thought of. Much was written about how our own corporations need to set up work spaces and times. I hope that companies do read and learn from this book. I believe the fish bowl effect of office to be unhealthful. At least it was for me.<br /><br />A great book. I highly recommend it to everyone, not just introverts, as it will lead to understanding and progressive changes. I may actually have to buy this one to have on hand in the future. But for now I am thankful that my library had it in Kindle form.
B007NESBK2|1.0|I have many blue-ray concerts and this product is very disappointing in quality of sound and video.  Video quaility is around 2 and sound quality is 1. I really like Sade and had high hopes for this concert.  Was very disappointed.
B007HGPBRC|4.0|The brilliant but dying Christopher Hitchens didn't waste the unpleasant and otherwise demoralizing experience of dying. He chronicles it with insight, courage, penetrating analysis and surprising good humor.
0345536886|5.0|Again an excellent narrative by one of today's greatest writers.  His message strikes a chord for all business that are run with the same mindset.  The plot could be superimposd into any small struggling business that has owners who haven't got the goods to cut it.  With Grisham's style the story comes alive and captures the reader from the very first sentence. An excellent read.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I almost passed by this book as my family is dealing with cancer.  I wasn't sure I could hold back the emotions and tears that so readily come when the \\"C\\" word is mentioned.  However, the five stars drew me in and I couldn't put it down.  The emotions it stirs are raw and acurate.  It is a beautiful story that acruately portrays the ups and downs of trying to hold on to hope when hope is really all you have left.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This movie is one of the best of its kind ever, right up there with Academy Award winner the Lord of the Rings Part 3 - Return of the King. What a joy to now own it! It's spectacular....
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Very thought provoking.  Should be a must read for all of us looking towards the future instead of living in the here and now.
B003LQMZS0|5.0|This toy is a must, provides lots of entertainment for a baby. It is hard for a baby to reach, so I would hand it to the baby while in the car seat or having tummy time. My child likes this so much, I purchased two so we could make sure they we always have one with us. Several different textures are present on the toy to entertain the child. This toy has also been washed several times and has held up well.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|The mystery kept me reading but I didn't like the very dark and depressing feel to the whole story.  Instead of wanting more towards the end, I wanted it to be done so I could move on to something a little lighter and more refreshing.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|A great storyline that kept me guessing until the very end.  Seriously hot romance, mystery and great writing make for a page-turner from the very beginning.  Read this, you will not be disappointed.
B008UUPOVM|5.0|I am a huge Owl City fan. I love all of Adam Young's music. This CD is very different than his others mostly because the lyrics make sense. I love the tunes and almost every song is a favorite. A great new addition to my Owl City collection.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|This is about a little quantum who protects the trees but progress and lack of being in body cause massive lack of nature. There seems to be creativity but without birds and trees, flowers and bugs. How sad this happens. I loved the lorax because he didn't want anything to get hurt. He loved the world and all its beauty, and he couldn't stop the way it went, he wanted to protect the little bears and be happy in his nature. The things I loved, the beautiful water in the land of dreams, I wish my home could be this, pink and purple trees, a horse and buggy that holds all you need, a friend like quantum, teddys to hold onto, only thing would be loving angel people. That would be a home. I loved the way the grandma and the little boy and mom had a night where they played games together. I loved the storytelling.
B006IDG2T6|5.0|You're a human being with free will  - you decide whether you'd like coffee or tea in the morning.  You decide what clothing to wear to work.  You have control over how you approach the world. You have control.<br /><br />...  or do you?<br /><br />Sam Harris puts forth a logically woven argument in this book that will likely leave your world a little bit changed.  Are you curious yet? =)  Study of the human mind says that we're not likely to read anything that runs counter to what we already believe.  So, I don't know what other reviewers have written - but I'm not going to tip his hand.  No matter how you feel, I recommend you read this book because it will cause a shift in your viewpoint (how much of a shift depends on how you felt about the matter before you read it)

B0080BFVPU|3.0|A great film, but Blu-ray picture quality is well below what you would expect for a 15 year old film. Very shoddy work by Disney, only looks slightly better than a DVD.<br /><br />Five stars for the film, one star for Disney's awful transfer to blu-ray.

B007IXWKUK|3.0|This had potential but it is just so repetitive. Plus it is a little far fetched that the sex is always so amazing.
B004Q3RDUW|4.0|This book, as a follow to \\"Kite Runner\\" did not disappoint. Moving, captivating and very visual in his storytelling, I look forward, with bated breath to Khaled Hosseini's next offering.
0786166835|3.0|I seem to remember there being some to-do about this story being less than 100% true, but the details escape me. This is a harrowing tale, even if it is (supposedly) embellished. Listening to a book always makes it harder for me to remember certain points--like favorite quotes--but one scene sticks in my mind, even if the exact words don't. On his first Christmas Eve in captivity, Rawicz and his fellow prisoners are making the long march north to Siberia. One man begins to sing O Holy Night, and each prisoner joins him in their own language. What an amazing moment that must have been to witness.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The final chapter of the saga is full of turning points that are interesting to read. Although the ending isn't narrated quite the way that I expected you have lots of fun with it.

B008Z9YLV2|4.0|After all the hype, this movie was much better than I thought it would be. Much credit to Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson. They brought out the substance in their respective characters.
B009329ZF2|4.0|This movie was better than I expected it to be. It had excellent graphic and sound effects. The story line was OK, but all in all a little<br />unbeleivable. The movie is fiction though, so I expected that.
B003PJ6UHA|5.0|This is a jewel of knowledge. Giving the most complete information to date of how to view the system of the world and beyond.  Although Einstein was important, it is good to see further thinking beyond and references from the new Genius of today.

076790592X|1.0|I suffer from the same disease Morrie had -ALS or Lou Gehrig's. Albom's representation of the disease and how it impacts a sufferer is entirely wrong, in my experience. I am appalled that this man has made truckloads of money from this disease, without bothering to get his facts right. If he misunderstood it when he wrote the book, he should issue a new, revised edition.<br /><br />Far from the wonderful, uplifting experience that those who don't know the disease say they get from this book, I warn those who suffer from ALS and their families and friends to give this book a wide berth. It is all about Albom and does not give true credit to the real mental and physical anguish that those of us who suffer from the disease feel.<br /><br />This is not one of those wonderful books hat help the soul soar, it is an exercise in self aggrandisement, a misrepresentation of a serious and appalling disease and another example of media driven success, regardless of content.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was in totally shock. Cldnt put the book down wow a must read but of course after the first one
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|At first it sounded like fun so I decided to try it out since it was free. I figured if I didn't like it, I could always delete it. Well I like it. It is addicting.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I love to read series books of different genre. I must say, I heard about this series through my friends and the media.<br />I was getting mixed opinions and reviews about the story... Therefore I was contemplating to read this series.  I ended up renting the first move to see what the hype was about. It was good so I took a chance and read the last two books. Upon completing the series, I can honestly say this was the first story series that I am not impressed with at all. This story moves around too much... There is too much information crammed into this book, leaving the reader to be confused. I found the ending of this series to be very unsatisfying.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I'm going to say a bunch of personal things, so if you don't have the patience, skip this! Since I don't really write reviews but thoughts about my reading experience, this is probably more about me than the book.<br /><br />I'm Italian, I live in Italy, I'm almost forty and I've read more or less everything by King until Dreamcatcher, which I hated, and I tried again something in 2006 or 2007, Cell, which was unimpressive, then I tried Just After Sunset in 2009 and I couldn't get past the first story, and I decided my marriage with King was over. Where was the magic? I wasn't swept away by is writing and imagination anymore. So why did I give this almost 900-page tome a chance?<br /><br />In 1978 Italy's Prime Minister Aldo Moro was kidnapped by the Red Brigades, a group of left-extremists and later killed. His corpse was found inside the trunk of a car in Rome. I wasn't five yet at the time, but those images were impressive and I know from my parents' reaction that it was shocking. I remember my mom sitting in front of the TV with me. She told me that she felt as shocked as when she was a young girl and learned from TV that somebody had shot the young American President John Kennedy. It was a little seed that sprouted a morbid fascination with that historical event, that I studied later with a lot of interest. I wouldn't pass King writing about it.<br /><br />I'll tell you why it's not a 5-star rating. I didn't put it down for one minute, if not for going to work and sleeping, but it seemed a bit flimsy in few parts, there were parts about Jake's preparation that felt too long and repetitive and I don't think the ending was very effective, even if I was satisfied with it. I also think King chose the easy way out with the paradoxes and possible explanations for the apparent inconsistencies in time travel. I'll have to read it again and focus more on it, but it's just too easy to acknowledge and immediately dismiss them.<br /><br />Anyway I enjoyed this story incredibly. Jake's voice is engaging, the voice of a smart man, not overly emotional, and that's probably the best choice to make the reader follow him in his journey. At first it's an exploration, the accomplishment of a mission, but slowly life takes over in every aspect. While Jake is waiting for Oswald to reach his appointment with destiny, Jake finds a town where he can teach and spread his true talent, he participates in the winnings and losses of his friends, he meets a woman he begins to fall in love with.<br /><br />The warmth he encounters in Jodie makes his life close to Lee Oswald even more chilling. The book here gave me nightmares. In the first part of the book, when Jake experiments with the power of time travel and goes to Derry, there is - I think especially for the readers who spent a lot of time there like me with It - a lot of evil in the air, Jake's mission here is gruesome. It's equally scary to see an idealistic young man with a delusional streak to turn into an assassin. King lets us see all of Oswald's faces, but he never fabricates excuses for Oswald's decisions. What you're left with is a lot of ruined lives. What you're left with is that history sometimes equals great power and success with the single-minded determination of a loser. And many other deep thoughts I won't bore you with (like for example the worth of single lives, all right, I'll shut up).<br /><br />I knew, and in King's postscript he confirms it, that there was a lot of research in this book, but what I found incredibly fascinating is the King's easiness of feeding us that story. Everything seems plausible and I am afraid that in a few months what I read will become the truth for me. It's scary scary. With an effective narration fiction becomes as true as the future Jake could affect with his mission.<br /><br />And now a little game I played with myself. Who would I go back to save? I hope I'd go back to the end of the '70s and try to beat Mark Chapman unconscious with a copy of The Catcher in the Rye. 12/8/80, that's my book.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Great book! Couldn't put it down! This is a must read! Moving on to the third book \\"Girl who kicked hornetts nests\\"
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I found the book to be too much repitition and probably not a good read for a lot of average readers. Certainly not a book to leave laying around the house or for that matter on a home library shelf. It has no doubt made a lot of money but you can get the same content from thousands of 'porn' web sites on the net for nothing.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This wasn't a horrible book, by any means.  Collins managed to resolve many different issues with many different characters.  But the way to do that could have been done without killing a great many characters that we had grown to appreciate.  Some of them outright deserved it.  But to kill off the District 4 tribute that had begun to make us smile, and after all he had been through and achieved?  No.  That was a huge misstep on the author's part.<br /><br />I gave the book three stars because while she does get the whole Katniss/Peeta thing figured out, it also makes you wonder why she even bothered with attempting a triangle between Katniss/Peeta/Gale in the first place.  There was just no purpose with it.  Not really angsty, no real drama behind it.  The closest you get in the whole series is when Peeta gets irritated with Gale.  But while Gale supposedly \\"loves\\" Katniss, it never really rings true and becomes a misused plot device.<br /><br />Read the book.  Then go write some better fanfiction.

B00009PBRP|1.0|I could not watch it because it was not for my region. I never had that problem with any other videos I had ordered. I sent it back and got a refund. I was very disappointed that I was unable to view the film. It is one of my favorites.
0060555661|2.0|I'm not writing to review the quality of Benjamin Graham's knowledge and advice. If I were, I'd give it 5 stars, because Graham's clear prose is filled with useful data, anecdotes, and advice. And that's part of the problem. With a book like this, you want to read it with a highlighter, so you can quickly scan chapters back over again and pick out the most important parts. But if you try to do that with this book, you'll just go mad. I have tissues that are thicker are less-porous than the pages of this book. My toilet paper is made of sterner stuff. Highlight the front of the page, and the highlighter is almost more visible from the back. No matter how you try, using a highlighter on this book just creates an unwieldy mess.<br /><br />If you want a copy of Benjamin Graham's The Intelligent Investor just to read through casually, this particular one will be just fine. But if you want to actually study Graham, do yourself a favor and find a better copy.
B009LZDGSI|5.0|I've thoroughly enjoyed the first two episodes. Well cast and entertaining without the emphasis on blood and gore. Nicely done, not too scientific--just good entertainment in a semi-old fashioned crime-solving way.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read with non stop action. I had to down load the sequels to find out what happened.  You won't be disappointed
B004UNX1LS|5.0|I enjoy watching selected videos. Vevo has a large selection to choose from. All the newest videos and star interviews.
0385344333|5.0|I can't wait for the next \\"Jack Reacher\\" book to come out. A Wanted Man was no exception. It's a very easy read and well worth the time, as it kept my attention to the very end. Great book.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|My sisters comment to me was what was the purpose and I don't think there was suppose to be a purpose, it was just a fun trip with several different people on a kinda Holiday. I really enjoyed the movie as a trip of my own to part of India with interesting people from England with different backgrounds and different life experiences to share with each other.  I have seen this movie 3 times since it was first in theatre's and still enjoy the adventure they shared with the audience.  Think anyone 60+ will enjoy this movie and I recommend it as taking time to take a trip with fellow seniors.<br />Judy
B007NG93CK|4.0|Very good book- I like the way she writes and how she delivers the plot and characters to the reading audience.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|It started on page one and just got better and better. Reacher never lets you down. Childs seem to have a fondness for mid America, as so many of his terrific books happen there.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Excellent historical fiction along the lines of Wouk's Winds of War & War and Remembrance.  A little sluggish in places (but what historical account isn't) yet presents a thorough explanation of the division of classes in Great Britain at the turn of the 20th century as well as the Russian Revolution and Wlison's attempt to establish The League of Nations.  I am truly looking forward to Book Two of the Trilogy.
B003Z0BWT0|4.0|Amazing series, every book seems to get better! I haven't had a series keep me up like this since Twilight
B005EGXTEE|3.0|I liked the concepts and plot despite the possible influence of \\"1984\\" on the author in presenting the new North America.  The envoronment the heroine operated within until she left to take part in the Hunger Games was convincing and her life there was a good read.  From then on I found the storey to be about early teens and written for that age group, despite the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" aspect of the conflict.  I would have liked to be informed that it was written mainly for young adults in the book details.  It was an enjoyable read but I won't buy books 2 & 3.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I just purchased one of these here on Amazon today for the retail price of $34.99. Lots of places are getting them in stock slowly. I used nowinstock.net and they sent me a text when it was available at certain places. I was missing them for about a week, Amazon was only getting in a few at a time, but today when I got a text and signed in there were 11 left and I snagged one. My 14 year old will love this! I told him not to hold his breath for Christmas since I wasn't paying $100 for this from someone on ebay; he will be totally shocked!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|This Jack Reacher novel didn't grab me as much as Child's previous novels with this character.  Perhaps I have just grown a little \\"familiar\\" with the series and was expecting something more dramatic.  In any case I'll probably be first in line to buy the next book in this series.  Thanks, Lee Child, for keeping Jack Reacher alive and well.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|Overall I think this is a fantastic product! I took one star away because sometimes it takes the watch up to 15 mins to acquire satellites. This has happened about 3 times out of about 20 for me. It is also a bit bulky but I didn't subtract a star for that- it has an entire GPS unit in it so you have to expect it to be a bit bulky. I have had no problems with the website and I contacted customer service to help me set it up. Got someone on the line in about 2 mins and he was extremely helpful! =)
B008I34ZFW|5.0|A well made movie with a little political message, but still very fun and silly. Lots of clever pop-culture references. Worth the watch.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I've read quite a few books on SEALS and have seen most good movies, and some really bad, on them and this is by far the one that made me have even an inkling of what it would be line to be a SEAL. Could not put it down and toward the end it was hard to keep a dry eye. A must read.
0316228532|5.0|Let me start by saying, this is the first book I've ever read by this author.  The FIRST.  It will not be the last.<br /><br />In THE CASUAL VACANCY Ms. Rowling begins building a foundation of characters and continues to add layers and layers to them until you know them wholley.  Really know them.  You won't like most of them.  You'll want to like some of them; but, then you won't.  You'll want to hate some of them.  But then realize you can't.  Sometimes dark, very dark, this is a story of what happens when people's selfish motives destroy them and the ones they love.  Completely destory them.  This is more than a story of a political race, as some would suggest.  It is a story of human nature.  Sadly.  Human nature.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love Minecraft, and I was so excited when it came out on mobile version. It was everything I expected... almost. If I could rate 4&frac12;&#9733;'s, I would. This would be 5&#9733;'s with just a few item additions, namely redstone, glowstone, and minecart supplies. I would be thrilled to see this updated, so when it is, I will be sure to give 5&#9733;'s. Until then, this is still an awesome app, just not perfect.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|A great sequel! Kept me engrossed, aroused and now impatient for the next book to come. The premise is similar to 50 Shades but I would say this has its own stamp of uniqueness and intensity. I could not help but be drawn to Eva and Gideon's passion and obsessiveness for each other. Love it!
B009329ZF2|5.0|This is my first review about anything I've bought or rented from amazon. That said, Battleship is by far the best movie I can remember watching. It gave me chills at least five times throughout, and had such incredible acting, plot, and ideas behind it. This movie had everything I like to see in a movie (which is extremely rare to find), and I would recommend it a thousand times over.
0525953728|5.0|I stayed up late finishing this book the day I got it because I couldn't put it down. It was very insightful into the real life of a Navy Seal and to what actually happened in the UBL raid. It definitely made me more appreciative of the sacrifices the men and women of our military make to preserve our freedom. I didn't feel like it contained any secret or confidential information, but I guess that is for the Pentagon to decide. WARNING for younger readers, it does contain the F-word a few times.
B008673ZAQ|1.0|Really confused by all the high ratings. I was really looking forward to the sequel but this book reminded me too much of FIFTY. GROSS. Enough with the Dom/sub crap. Not sure if Ms. Day was trying to get the FSoG fans to like this book.  It was a total bore-- they had sex, they fought, she ran.Returning the keys again.. Seriously....  Breakup much???Nathan and Corinne should have had bigger roles for worthy reading material rather than the repetitive bore of Eva and Gideon's obsession with each other and the secrets. I'd rather read a few hotttt memorable sex scenes than just sex on every other page.Bared to you was so much better, this book was just exhausting!<br />Totally disappointed.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I installed this app on my android phone without. Any issues.  Also installed this app on my Generic Android tablet, seems to work fine.
B00846REIS|1.0|the book lacked drama.............the twists and turns made me not wnat to continue because it was all over the place.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|One of the best and most exciting Lee Child books yet.  Jack Reacher is so well defined in his character. Never carries a gun yet seems to know how to get out of every situation even when you think he is doomed. I really wondered how Lee Child was going to get Jack Reacher out of this one but he did it in such a way that I could never have guessed how he would do it.<br />Jack Reacher LIVES! Jack never carries extra clothes with him but somehow always finds a unique way to get new ones....  That is cheap ones...but new. He really doesn't need much to live on as he is always going from town to town with all new adventures and excitement from the first turn of the page.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I love Mitch Albom. His book keep on getting better and better. This one is the  best so far. If you liked the others book you love this one.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I bought this novel because I had read Sharp Objects. Well after pages and pages of back and forth nonsense of \\"who done it\\" we finally find out \\"who done it\\" I won't say that for those of you who want to read volumes of pretty much the same material to get to the point. It wouldn't of been such a waste of time except for the end. BORRRRINNNGGGG!!! What a boring lackluster ending!I mean if your going to write a great suspense novel the ending is just as important as the beginning and middle of the novel. If your sensitive to language and some strange sexual situations this won't be for you. If you want a great ending... well.. don't bother with this one~ Wait till its in the bargin bin!
B0011NVC98|4.0|I teach English to Seniors and they really enjoy watching this movie.  Of course, it doesn't really follow the true story line--but is fairly close. I do not understand the nudity in the show though.
1932735410|5.0|I am shocked that I am enjoying the experience of studying for the PMP exam.<br />My heartfelt thanks to Rita Mulcahy and her team for using engaging exercises and no fluff to cover a ton of areas I needed to dust off since business school. Everything I am studying is put into context and reinforced with each successive page and chapter. This book makes studying a no brainer.

B008XG1X18|4.0|but it has a habit of tying itself in a knot seemingly and having to he restarted. I wish it interacted with the browser a little better. on a kindle fire.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This is a great series--wonderful actors!!!!  My husband and I really enjoyed watching season one.  You are left guessing what will happen next. Not predictable really and I like that.
B009EAO38C|5.0|Imagine music that is not bound by common genre definitions or lyrics, but is grounded in something familiar enough that you recognize it, even as fresh life is breathed into it. That's The Piano Guys: the old and the new, blended into something that you already love along with something that you've never seen before. Their Youtube videos are amazing and their is music beautiful. If you can listen to Jon's fingers flying across the keys and Steven's cello strings singing and not feel something stirring in your soul, I submit that you just don't have one.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game was too much fun!  couldn't stop playing it till I finished cant wait till the next one!  you will be hooked
B009CO0B2C|5.0|The songs on this album are different from most of her earlier work, with alternate tunings and different vocal registers on some of the songs.  And there's no electronica here.  You won't get as many catchy, \\"pop\\" songs, but you will get more mature songs.  This is as good as anything else she's done, but in a different way.
B004LR5K0I|5.0|this is elvis at his best, studio & and live in the early 70's alot of his best hits, if you like elvis presley in the 70's than this is a must have 5 cd's to your collection
0439023491|3.0|After reading the 1st book, I wasn't sure what could follow the Hunger Games in Panem.  But of course The Quarter Quell (pretty much super games).<br /><br />Katniss and Peeta the two star crossed lovers (this was a bit much for me).  It was strung out too long<br /><br />I did enjoy the new cast of characters.<br /><br />Spoiler alert: katniss survives  There is no more district 12
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Excellent, I love the series!  Jared and Jensen (Sam and Dean) are well matched because they could really be brothers.  The series has just the right amount of horror with a little humor added.  Great Show.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Been following Jack Reacher since book one. Haven't missed any of Mr. Child's books and Reacher is now my favorite character in a continuing series. The lastest has more action than most, with lots of gun play. Kept my attention from first page until last. I envy the character. I would love to travelt he country with a toothbrush and no particular place to go. Highly recommended.
B004IK30S2|5.0|Blu-Ray is great. It came fast and was packaged correctly. Extras on the blu-ray were worth the price and upgrading from the dvd makes Ron's mustache look extra special.
0525953728|5.0|I enjoy reading books about the heroes in our military. So with all the fuss in the media about \\"No Easy Day\\", I decided I just had to read it.<br /><br />What a read it was! It is written in an easy-to-read style. The book doesn't only talk about the Bin Laden raid, but takes the reader through the selection course for Team 6, and then on to several missions, ending finally with the Bin Laden raid. This was a great read that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys military stories.<br /><br />The question now is, what was all the fuss about? I didn't think that the author gave away any operational secrets that could compromise future Team 6 missions. Yes, he spoke about clearing buildings from the top and bottom, and inserting directly on target vs. inserting a few miles away and hiking in to the target. I hardly think these things compromise anything. The SEALS are simply far too potent to be compromised by such minor details. Besides, that information was probably out there long before this book was written. I suspect this fuss is all political.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|OMG! I could hardly breathe while reading this book! I was excited, stressed, mad, happy....no one was allowed to speak to me while I had my kindle open! I don't know what I was expecting after Bared, but this was so much more! Loved, loved, loved it! Can't wait for Entwined!
B007THA4FI|4.0|The novel is partially about Pagford's children warring against their parents, and that is certainly an enjoyable subject, one we can all relate to. But Rowling is not content to depict middle-class adolescent rebellion. She goes even deeper, exploring a family from the Fields housing estate, whose daughter, Krystal Weedon, goes to school with Andrew and his unpleasant friend \\"Fats\\" Wall. Krystal barely has a family at all: a mother, Terri, who's a chronic heroin addict and former prostitute, a little brother who is learning disabled and neglected. One of the most powerful scenes in the book is when social worker Kay comes to interview Terri and tries to get through to her that her son is in danger of being taken away. Terri is barely there, a wispy wretch of a woman who can scarcely form a coherent thought. Yet Kay, enmeshed in her own personal problems, has this unexpected insight: \\"But not to feel, not to care... Right now, Kay thought, she's happier than I am.\\"<br /><br />Rowling's treatment of class goes deep. In fact, it's at the heart of the novel. Despite the miseries of the middle-class characters, their lives are not literally on the line. As I progressed through The Casual Vacancy, I had the unsettling feeling that most of the characters were doomed. But by the end, it's clear that the middle-class characters are essentially safe. It could be argued that Rowling denies some of her characters humanity in her rush to make the point that working-class characters are the true losers in modern English society.<br /><br />But Rowling's depiction of working-class life isn't boring--it's gripping. And she has done an amazing thing. She's made the pathetic figure of Terri Weedon human and relatable. When Rowling delves into Terri's terrible backstory, which unfolds as the matriarch of the family, Nana Cath, is dying, we are shown in flashback that Terri simply never had anyone to stand up for her. And the welfare state, as embodied by the careless and overstretched \\"care\\" of the social workers, just isn't good enough. Krystal, Terri's daughter, as feisty and strong as she appears externally, has had only one advocate, a man who's no longer there--Barry Fairbrother. In flashbacks we see that Barry, who grew up in the Fields himself, encouraged Krystal to join the school rowing team, which he coached, and amazingly they won... but Krystal's moment of glory was brief, and Barry's death has been devastating for her.<br /><br />I was deeply affected by The Casual Vacancy, and I didn't expect to be. There were moments in the book where I choked back tears. The most powerful moments were the swift flashes of insight, lyrically expressed. \\"Was it love when somebody filled a space in your life that yawned inside you, once they had gone?\\" a character asks herself. The internal worlds of the characters are fraught and lonely; each relationship Rowling examines seems frayed or deeply dishonest in a very true-to-life way.<br /><br />[This is just a portion of a much longer review I wrote of The Casual Vacancy.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett is one of my favorite authors.  Have read all of his books. The wait for \\"Winter of the World\\" was a long one but well worth it. Now I will have to count the days for the last of the trilogy.
B007TK77QE|3.0|Having just finished reading `A Casual Vacancy' By J. K. Rawlings I was interested to get a feel for the reviews already out there before starting on mine. Polarised is the first word that springs to mind. Comments such as:<br /><br />If this was not Rawlings would we have bothered to read it?<br />Harry Potter this is not and why did you burst my bubble?<br />Brilliant.<br /><br />Jo Rawlings is an Author first and foremost and as such writing is now in her blood. `A Casual Vacancy' shows she has what it takes to keep me interested. It is a page turner, it has characters to love and hate and it takes us on a journey to conclusion.<br /><br />That is not to say that I seek to visit these characters again. By-and -large they are better left alone after introduction. In Australian vernacular they are a cast of nuff-nuffs and wanna-be's and bring out the worst aspects of the class divide that still obviously rules Britannia or parts of it.<br /><br />Its premise of consequences from actions is brilliantly exploited. Someone dies, cages are rattled and all the simmering discontent within a community unravels explosively.<br /><br />Gritty, confronting and reflecting the need for societal change are all covered and Jo confronts these challenges realistically. There is even a degree of dry humour that lessens some of the societal blows she peppers the pages with; subtle comedic moments that made me laugh and then cringe.<br /><br />If it is permissible I would say, `Well done Jo!' I will be back to check out your next endeavour.
B003OPUZYY|3.0|I'm not going to write a novel on this item like others did. Although I will say this is a great package as far as what you get. Five full length albums in one collection which include single & studio album versions of certain songs. Full digitally remastered catalog at an affordable price.(Depending who & where you buy from). In my case I spent less than $13 and that included shipping for a brand new factory sealed copy. However there is only one flaw with the collection and that's the tracking. Some songs overlap the following so when you skip to the next track the beginning is usually cut off by a few seconds which kind of stinks in my opinion. However for the price I paid I got a great deal.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|I watched this movie at the theatre and really enjoyed it.  I bought it to share with my family.  However, the DVD was really dark as in half the picture was so dark you could not see any details.  True we did not watch the movie at night with no lights.  Maybe that would have helped. But we did have all the drapes pulled so it was semi-dark in the room.  And during much of the movie it was so dark that we could not see any detail at all. So....started at 5 stars for content and subtracted one star for quality of DVD.  I would recommend viewing this at night with no lights.

B0060AY85C|4.0|Retaining some of the themes of trauma in Morrison's SULA, this short novel moves brother and sister into a new sense of personal value and direction. The healing power of women is particularly remarkable.  I only wish there were more of it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Got this free on a promo, and promptly bought the second (Quell Reflect). Best $0.99 I ever spent! These are really beautifully done puzzle games. My only gripe is that I have finished both, and there aren't any more! I am now going back to solve each puzzle in the minimum number of moves, but as soon as there is another 'Quell' available, I'm getting it!

1439170916|5.0|A must read for anyone whose life has been touched by cancer. The Emperor of All Maladies is billed as a biography of cancer and it does just that, telling the history of the disease starting from Ancient Egyptian times. The author provides detail information about the evolution of the understanding (or mostly in the past misunderstanding) of the disease and how that affected treatment. But he does so in a way that is not only easy to read, but also gripping and compelling.<br /><br />For most of known history, we had no understanding of how the disease metastasized and therefore, when tumors were removed, more was considered better. This caused doctors with the best intentions to justify harsh treatments that brought patients to the brink of death.<br /><br />The book goes into the discoveries (many accidental--the used of chemo started with a mustard gas attack)that eventually led to our current understanding. Cancer is such an insidious disease, because in a perverted way, it is evolution trying to develop a better life form. Cancer cells are mutations that are faster growing and stronger than normal cells. But we possess that intangible, the human spirit, which drives dedicated and brilliant researches to find ways to fight the disease.<br /><br />By giving us a better understanding of where we've come from and where new research is heading, this book is makes for a fascinating read. But if you or a loved one is confronting this horrible disease, it will help you better cope with the difficult fight that all cancer patients face.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Loved this book. Its a quick read, coming of age story and I loved every minute of it. Now I can go see if the moview does the book justice!
B000YMM3CC|4.0|Having watched the movie and loved it, I couldn't help but read the book as well. Very moving love story and has a realistic side of showing that love stories don't always go like the fairytales do!

B007L4HET8|3.0|I bought my dad a D.V.D for christmas as i live in the south and he lives up north i got it delivered via Amazon. To my amazement when i went for a visit shortly after New Year. The D.V.D was on my parents table in the box. The cheeky Bugger said \\"i dont think i will enjoy that film can you get me spiderman 3\\" I was livid as i had bought him a present and the gratitude is that..... Anyway he already had spiderman 3 but not on blue ray so i took his home with me returned the other film and sent him a replacement. Anyway he is much happier. Not sure how he will feel this year as he is getting nowt from me the ungratefull swine.<br /><br />Hope you all enjoy the film as much as my Dad does. I watched the normal version and its a top film....... Im gonna get the Bluray version next time im up north ha ha ha

B006MW3V6U|5.0|A great show. The actors are so believable and they make it entertaining. One of the few period pieces that feels authentic.
0525423273|5.0|I loved this book, it was beautifully written and a total fluffy heart warming story.  I loved all the characters and how they all interacted with one another.  They all had great chemistry.  I look forward to rushing to the book store for more of this author.  I love that Stephanie has the perfect mix of heart warming and humor that makes you both want to cry and laugh all the way through this book.
0385737955|5.0|I was amazed by how the author wrote this book. He somehow managed to create a book that I could never come up with (the creativity in his writing is amazing) and still made the situation feel like something that could actually happen someday. He created characters that have enough detail and personality that they almost come to life on the page, and seems to have every situation in the book mapped out to draw the reader further in. I don't know if there is any real problem with the book, except for all the blood and gore that might turn away readers who are disgusted by that kind of description. Overall, I think this is a book that you must read if you haven't already, and the sequels/prequel are worth reading as well (The Scorch Trials, The Death Cure, and The Kill Order.)
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I am a huge Jack Reacher fan and couldn't wait to get my hands on A Wanted Man, but I was sorely disappointed.  This quite simply was not the Reacher most of us have come to enjoy.  The book was tedious and boring.  Reacher never even clinched a fist until approximately 85% into the book.  Another issue is there is no way a diminutive Tom Cruise can play Reacher with any cred to the actual character.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Gillian Flynn has an unique style and tone which is not only engaging but gives a new spin on classic narratives.  Her books are also great for people who do not want to wait 300 pages for something to happen.  I've always needed to finish her books within a day or 2.  Hers novels truly are \\"can't put down\\" reads.

Those are his strong points. But when he makes these songs that are just oversexualized, I mean they have no substance it's just noise with graphic lyrics in them. When are these new artist going to learn? It's the love songs that will hold up, look at all the artist of the passed. Sex is private thing that should be left in the bedroom, why does everyone need to know what you will do in the bedroom to your girlfriend or your groupie? lol I mean come on... This didn't sound like an R&B album to me, it sounded like a hip hop rap album with a couple of R&B songs. That's all I got...
0847830942|5.0|This book is about bicycles that were not only handbuilt but designed with a purpose of function and beauty. A bike built by a constructionist is the pinnacle of design and purpose. With the affordability of automobiles it's sad to say that nearly all of these shops are no longer in business. These men created magnificent bicycles for a world that relied on them every day. Sure they were touring bikes but at the time to ring bikes were used for racing also. This book focuses only on French bikes and has all the big names such as Renée Hurst and singer etc. Great photos and interesting information and I've found that any more in-depth information like blueprints etc. can be found on the Internet. If you're a bicycle connoisseur get this book!
B0015DROBO|5.0|I loved this book and also the movie.  It was a very intense book.  Very Good read, but yoy can not just scan through it like most if you do you will mess a lot.
B0015AARJI|2.0|I usually trust everything being sold at Amazon but on this item, I believe I received a knock off.<br />The controller does not rumble like the original controller that came with my PS3.<br />After using the controller for about 2 months, mostly with Madden, the buttons started to stick and<br />the controller will turn off by itself after being idle for 10 minutes.<br />I have the system wide setting to never turn the controller off but it seems this controller does not<br />accept system wide settings.<br />Quite disappointed with my purchase and planning to buy another OEM from game stop instead.
B0071BGOJC|3.0|I had pre-ordered this book and as soon as it arrived on my Kindle I was oblivious to the world around me, but ... The horrors on both the British and German sides during the Second World War were graphically described, so much so that the reader could feel he/she was present, I was but in the wilds of Yorkshire (almost out of harm's way). The 'but' bit comes into play in the immediate post-war period which became too much oriented towards how good the British Labour Party was/is - almost a political diatribe. In short - the first 90odd percent (on Kindle) = brilliant, the last 10% ....! However and nonetheless, when volume three appears as 'coming soon, pre-order now' I will be there.
B0098VXE50|4.0|I really enjoyed this version of the classic fairytale.  Charlize Theron gave a brilliant performance as the wicked queen.  If for nothing else, her acting alone is worth seeing this movie.  The other actors did good as well.  The cinematography and special effects were very well done.  As far as the storyline and directing, yes, it could have been better, but can't most movies of this genre?  This definitely is not for young children, and I would say that parents use their own discretion.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|THE AVENGERS IS AN AWESOME MOVIE AND THE BLURAY IS EVEN BETTER, EVERYONE SHOULD GET IT FOR IT IS STUPENDOUS, SPECTACULAR, TREMENDOUS AND EXHILLERATING. IT IS THE BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE OF THE YEAR BESIDES DARK KNIGHT RISES AND AMAZING SPIDERMAN
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Best series ever. Makes you always wanting more.   Hope there is a 4th book very very very soon. Definitely recommended.
B004S699K4|1.0|Here we go again, catering to the idiots who need there tv screen \\"filled up\\".  The correct aspect ratio for Halloween H2O is 2:35.1 not 1:78.1.  This is the age of big widescreen HD televisions, will these video companies please let go of that \\"people don't want to see those black bars\\" crap!  I thought finally, the bluray technology will allow us to see movies the way they were meant to be seen.  It's a shame because the picture quality on Halloween H2O is great!  The old Dimension dvd has the correct aspect ratio and is loaded with extras this Echo Bridge edition has no extras.  Beware of other Echo Bridge bluray titles with incorrect aspect ratios ( \\"Cursed\\", \\"Venom\\"...)  I hope Echo Bridge starts making things right!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book is a good inside look as to how the men on the mission see things. The teams are very good at what they do and they just want to get the job done, get home, train, and do it again (lather,rinse,repeat). It's a very tough life and the author is honest about how the families of the teams suffer having to \\"share\\" them with their jobs keeping the country safe.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is super addictive! The more you play the faster the coins regenerate, which is great. I have this game on my phone but it is much, much more fun on the Kindle Fire!<br />Awesome that it was FREE!!!
B005K17RU0|4.0|simple and easy. all I use this for is for current weather and forecasts when I miss my news program.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Such a great suspense, and a wonderful romance too! I just couldn't put it down. I cant wait for the next book.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Great for passing time. I love this game, I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to kill time, or to help educate children about simple/basic economics.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|This book is a page turner!  So Good and intense.  A deep subject matter but also a great read.  I highly recommend this trilogy.  I'm on book 3 now and am loving them all!
0307960471|5.0|First, a warning. DO NOT READ ANY OTHER REVIEWS.  Too many are giving up spoilers.  Consider yourself warned.  I am doing my best to avoid any, but several here (and in newspaper reviews) are giving away key points.<br /><br />Jo Nesbo has created an engrossing and fast moving novel set among the drug trade in Oslo where Detective Harry Hole, a reoccurring protagonist in his stories, arrives to rescue his son.  Nesbo has sketched complex identities for the characters inhabiting his story.  Clues are camouflaged as casual thoughts.<br /><br />An unusual running commentary from the deceased victim, written in italics, acquaints us with the often drug-induced thinking that got him killed and adds to the suspect list.  This is a book where you have to reread a page from time to time to make sure you got it right. Toward the end, by the process of elimination and slightly disappointed, I had identified the murderer.  Then WHAM, the ending knocked me out of my chair.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Let me start off this review by telling you exactly how many books I've read cover to cover. That answer being 6. I have never been a huge reader throughout my life and could never finish a book without getting bored but after watching the first season of Game of Thrones on HBO I decided to pick up Martin's books. I have not been able to put them down since. While A Feast for Crows was a little bit of a labor to get through admittedly I still enjoyed it. Dance with Dragons on the other hand I did not have the same feeling. I enjoyed it completely. This series is incredibly addicting and thought provoking. The twists, turns and cliff hangers leave you coming back for more. If you have not read these books I encourage you to give them a try even if you are not the typical fantasy fan, as I am not myself. They are a joy and incredibly well written, Dance with Dragons is no exception. Thank you George RR Martin, I can't wait for the next verse of your amazing song.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Book 2 was overpowering. I LOVED IT. I felt connected to Gideon and Eva with an ache in my soul. I can't explain it any other way. You want to cry with them, laugh with them, LOVE WITH THEM. The pain is so deep for them together and apart. But the love is so raw and pure, it pierces your heart. Looking forward to Book 3 with great anticipation and a heavy heart. I love it when a book ROCKS my world.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is very addictive I play it so much.Now my daughter plays it with me we love it so much.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|How many times can I read the same sex scene?? After reading the two other books, everything seems like dejavu! The repetition in these books is unbelievable and I can't believe this author has made billions from them.  Poor writing and so much repetition you're going to start skipping parts because i'ts the same thing of the same thing.  The only thing she does well is create two great characters...that's what keeps you pulled in.
B0022W98I4|5.0|great and fast (duh online mp3!) ;D well you should listen to it yourself to find out if you like the album! so buy it
B002SF9YNO|5.0|I first watched this movie on Netflix instant based on a system recommendation. I had never heard of it nor did the synopsis seem terribly interesting. Netflix however has been pretty good at predicting what I like over the past few years so I gave it a shot.  I bought the DVD shortly after watching it.<br /><br />This is one of the best movies I have seen in years, if not the best.  I'd never seen Masahiro Motoki before so I didn't know what to expect of him.  I've seen Ryōko Hirosue in a few things (the young girl in Wasabi) and she has been good. Both of the leads were excellent in their roles, perhaps the best I have seen of Ryōko Hirosue.<br /><br />The plot of the movie was totally unexpected. I expected a really slow drama more like Tokyo Sonata (which bored me). Not only is it entertaining and funny throughout, it also gives you a look into the way death is handled in Japanese culture. It also shows what a different life the people who prepare the dead must live because they are mostly shunned by society for being 'dirty'.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film. I think anyone would enjoy it.<br /><br />PS - Don't confuse it with [[ASIN:B000M341QE The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)]], though that movie is excellent as well. :)
B008XG1X18|4.0|A little slow sometimes, but good for the most part. Easy to navigate and pretty nice layout. I love pinterest!
0525953728|5.0|Riveting and informative! Takes you into the mindset and intellect of America's warriors. Describes OBL's takedown in intimate detail.<br />Don't miss reading this book.
1616614609|5.0|The original Netrunner CCG came out many years ago, and like many CCG's of the time, slowly faded away. It was an excellent game, with a great unique mechanic, but fell prey to power creep.<br /><br />Recently, Fantasy Flight Games bought the license, and republished the card game themselves. They looked at the card sets from the original set, and retooled it with their \\"Living Card Game\\" system, to truly balance the game.<br /><br />This revamped version removed the CCG aspect, allowing a low price point for entry, and further allowing them to balance the game based on properly created cards, rather than relying on scarcity.<br /><br />They did a fantastic job. They retained almost all of the original rules, and balanced the cards to create a great new version. I highly recommend this to card game fans who haven't played the game before, as well as to people who enjoyed the original iteration.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I just finished 11/22/63, and it was a great read.  Not at all what I expected based on the description, the cover, or the author - but even better than I imagined.  I tend to think that most of Stephen King's books are good but gory; this novel has proven that he is truly a master storyteller and author and has more range than some would expect.  I could go into a lot of detail about the storyline, but I almost hate to give it away.  Buy it, read it, and think about it for weeks afterwards!
0525953728|5.0|This book was well written and seemed to be interested in presenting the factual story of what happened leading up to and during the Bin Laden raid.  I also liked the back story on the authors journey to become a SEAL and then join the \\"DEVGRU\\" team (Seal Team 6), I personally liked it much better than some of the self aggrandizing versions of stories written by other members of the Special Ops community (Think \\"Rogue Warrior\\" by Marcinko) that would have you believe they were personally responsible for gigantic feats of heroism and Machismo that would not have been possible without their personal involvement. Overall I would recommend the book.
B0091XRL86|4.0|I have a soft spot for Wallace and Gromit, and if you like them, then you'll enjoy this movie, produced by Aardman Animations.

B00943SP0G|1.0|Even Johnny Dep couldn't save this pile of excrement.  Once again, Tim Burton managed to take an excellent group of actors and reduce them to mindless, two dimensional, humorless caricatures.  The trailer is the best part of this
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Sweet sweet app. Sweet app.  Just installed and was practicing checking it out.  Its so smooth and easy to use. The big keys and numbers are a blessing.  Very very happy with this app.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Love this app for finding recipes of all levels and types of food. Have had app for about a week and have already used several. Also provides a little dose of humor occasionally.<br />--
B008Y1YFNU|5.0|this is by far there best work from start to finish it does not fail and is my opinion a number one contender for best rock album of 2012
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I could go on for days about the crossfire series, but instead Ill just suggest that you read it! This series is totally comparable to the Fifty Shades trilogy. It‘s a fairy tale love story with a little naughtyness to it. Reflected in You is even better than Bared to You, so I can only imagine that the third book will be phenomenal!! Enjoy!!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I have read several sci-fi books and this series is well done.  Good plot some great twists that keep you entertained and looking forward to reading more.  I did feel as though the end of book five was a little abrupt and left me expecting/wanting a book six.  Overall, a good read.
030758836X|3.0|The Gone Girl has won high praise from critics and has been a New York Times bestseller, proving once again that critical acclaim doth not a good book make.<br /><br />On Nick and Amy Dunne's fifth wedding anniversary Amy mysteriously disappears. Nick, the quintessential weenie, appears oddly unaffected, even evasive and as the evidence mounts it becomes clear that his beautiful wife has meet with foul play and the allegedly loving husband is the prime suspect. Gone Girl creates a compelling peek into the lives of two co-dependent individuals one of whom is the worst kind of psycho.  Gone Girl provides an interesting perspective on media coverage, police procedure and the effect of personality in criminal cases.<br /><br />The design of the novel, alternating chapters from Nick's point of view with Amy's diary, is engaging and creates a page turning reading experience.  I eventually found, however, that the diary began reading like a Seinfeld script and was tempted to skip the later entries. The plot is intricate, and detailed, two attributes I enjoy and look for in a good thriller.  My disappointment arrived long before the conclusion when the plot resolved- on page 370 and an epilogue of sorts ended this four hundred twelve page novel with an unsatisfying metallic clunk.<br /><br />The writing is fast paced, witty and engaging.  The psychological elements are beyond insightful and become frighteningly real but the police procedural aspects are lacking which becomes a distraction.  The plot, to a point, is brilliant but for this reader it becomes the fatal flaw of Gone Girl. Two stars is very forgiving.
B003FXXNBW|5.0|The best movie of Scott Adkins undoubtedly the video and sound are super improved over the DVD version.<br />Very happy with my Blu-ray Undisputed 3.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I was eagerly awaiting the sequel to \\"Empire of Giants,\\" as I wanted to continue to follow the lives of the main characters Ken Follett created in this first of a trilogy. I was disappointed that \\"Winter of the World\\" skipped ahead 20+ years and the main focus of the novel is the lives of the \\"offspring\\" of these characters.
B004HD61KE|4.0|As I started   reading this  book, I was not sure I would finish it. So much seemed contrived and some narrative seemed amateurish. When I read a really engrossing book, the printed  words seem to fade from my vision and form pictures  in my mind. Nothing like that happened in the first half of this book; in fact, I found my attention wandering away, and frequently had to go back and reread entire paragraphs. I found the abrupt shifts away from one set of characters and circumstances to another set to be distracting and disruptive. Half-way through, the pace increased considerably and grabbed my attention so that I didn't  want to put my Kindle to sleep. Also,  I do not subscribe to the PC “Noble Redman“ view of the American Indian, so I probably will not read further in this series. The second half of this book made up for the pedestrian pace of the beginning, and redeemed the 4-star rating.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I love the 50 Shades series but this series goes beyond that. To say I'm obsessed with these books would be an understatement and this one book in particular got to me. I absolutely LOVED this book! The story line and the characters were excellent and ... AH! Seriously would recommend this book to everyone. By far my favorite book I have ever read. It got my pulse racing, my heart beating and overall myself just itching to find out what happens on the next page. Throughout the entire book I couldn't keep my eyes off of this. I am SO anxious for the next book in this series and I have no doubt in my mind that it won't be as good as the first too. BRAVO!
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I guess you've probably had a book you read make a big change in your life, I know I have.  A. Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes has been around for a long time and was written for the sensibilities and tastes of the Victorian era.  Arguably that could mean it is pretty much not to the modern tastes.  Still, people are reading Jane Austin and Charles Dickens these days without a blink.  I was 12 years old and on my very first visit to Europe when I read it.  I can remember thinking: why does Holmes always figure out these puzzling crimes while everybody else is oblivious?  The obvious answer was that he noticed details and realizing that fact has literally changed my life.  I'm not telling you that this great old book will change your life but it just might.  Even if it doesn't, it's still a classy set of stories and some great reading. I'm reading it again for my fourth time and I love it!
B009329ZF2|4.0|I was happy to see the most exciting scenes of the movie again. I liked the initial response of the aliens with a sonic boom! The theory is old, communicating evil intent telepathically. I liked the alien ordnance that looked like pegs from the actual game. I would recommend it!
B0087JTAKW|1.0|I didn't enjoy this book at all and it is a wonder that I finished reading it.  I thought it was stupid and don't understand why other's liked it.  It was idiotic.
B000OCXI3K|5.0|What a wonderful book!  I've seen the movie several times and loved it but the book although basically the same is also different; somehow both darker and more magical.  I just purchased Peaches for Father Francis and since that tale revisits the same town and speaks of some of the same folks I needed to re familiarize myself with the characters.  Since I hadn't read the book I felt that that would be the best place to start. I read and also really enjoyed Girl With No Shadow it ties part of the story also but can stand fairly well alone.
B007SGM084|4.0|The trilogy started off good, but by the middle of book two (Fifty Shades Darker) it was getting repetitive with Ana trying to be herself and Grey getting ticked off.  Other than that getting old quick, you had to keep reading to see if Grey had his \\"break through\\" moment.<br /><br />I would recommend this trilogy, it is a good story line.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Jack Reacher has run out of gas.  Maybe it was his broken nose and the head trauma associated with it.  This story was boring and the ending made no sense.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|A great blues jam session. Buddy Guy, Muddy Waters, The Rolling Stones together, how good it that? Video and music remix is well done. A gem of a DVD.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love this app.  There is only one problem, the app freezes then you have to force close then re-open the app. If they would fix that this app would be 5 stars for sure.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|There are some suprises in book 3.  A little suspence and time when it had me wanting to shout out.  RED RED.  Being a romantic I enjoyed the book.  I think I would say thus about the series. Started out flat, got interesting, and ended flat.  Still well written book with a lot of twist along the way
B007SSDS24|5.0|I enjoyed the movie it was good, the effects for excellent. I would like to see a sequel coming soon.
160774273X|5.0|I baked my way through Jim Lahey's book, then moved on to Peter Reinhart. I bought this book based on reviews that said it would not be redundant. The reviews were right. I have baked bread that looks exactly like the cover picture. Flour, Water, Salt and Yeast is a well organized cookbook that educates the beginner and the experienced baker alike. Recipes are written with  1000 grams of flour and varying  percentages of water, making it easy to compare recipes. He lists the ingredients at the beginning of the recipe and  also includes the measurements in the instructions so that you don't have to flip back and forth.  I make whole grain breads with freshly milled grain and I have had the best results with Ken Forkish's method. The 75% whole wheat was incredible. Thanks Ken!<br /><br />1/8/2013<br /> Still loving his book! The double fed levain is definitely worth the effort. A note to anyone making 100% whole wheat bread with freshly milled wheat... I have had the best results using 940 grams flour, 30 grams gluten ( mix thoroughly) and 950-1000grams water.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the ending to this 3 book series. I would recommend it to anyone! I almost wish there were more.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Great game. One of the best games I have on my kindle fire. I will probably be playing for a while.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This was by far the best book in this set.  Three is next and one was last.  It could have been a great love story without all the explicit sex.  I don't need the same things repeated over and over again to get the idea.
B007C4ZJ0S|5.0|As a woman, I LOVE films that show intelligent women standing up for themselves and defending themselves. This film is great, I loved it. Believable with good characterization and wonderful actors, it gets top rating from me. I looked Gina Carano up on the web and she's pretty amazing - the fighting is really her, she trained as a \\"MMA,\\" mixed martial artist. Her acting is very good and she looks great, but really, it's the confidence and ability to fight that makes her stand out. The jazz background sound track is terrific too. As female action actors I also like Angelina Jolie's Salt, Milla Jovovich's Joan of Arc, and Charlize Theron's Aeon. It's about time women got some respect. Guess we had to fight for it.
B00486UF52|5.0|I am glad I downloaded this book for my Kindle Fire.  It is something I should have read before my recent trip to England.
B00000I41J|5.0|Best cool, late-night, beatnik-style, coffee-drinking, smokin' and romancin' jazz album ever. Listen to samples, then buy it, daddy-o. Or, if you don't want to buy it, DON'T listen to the samples, because if you DO listen, you'll buy it. Dig it?
0525953728|4.0|A great book for anyone who can't get enough about military raids, or the bin laden mission in particular.  Author does not venture outside his scope of the mission, appreciated.
B002APU580|5.0|I've seen this many times on TV but it didn't always show everything.  So, I purchased the DVD and have enjoyed it movie.
1410430103|1.0|Book arrived from Amazon.com; however, it is a large print edition. No where in the product description was that key fact disclosed. Nice \\"old lady\\" edition; too bad I'm not a geriatric reader.
030746363X|5.0|4-Hour Body gathers a lot of information on a many fascinating subjects.  Tim Ferriss is great in the way he's obsessed with finding the easiest route to any number of means.  He brings years of his obsessions into a simply read book.  Well worth the time and money.  It's a book that will be pulled from the shelf many, many times.
B003QP4NPE|3.0|I had a fun time reading this book.  The idea of science and computer AI doing the things described in it were really intriguing to me.  The flow of the book makes it easy and quick to read.  I did find the ending to be a little too neat, and that probably made me rate it a 3 instead of a 4.  At that rating, the sequel will be further down on my list of next books to read.
1594744769|4.0|Well crafted language.  Nicely paced.  Engrossing for my 11 and 9 year old boys as well as me the adult reader.  I had to skip one or two very brief sections with difficult to explain sexual references.  Some mild language--but nothing they're not already hearing on the playground.<br /><br />This story is clever, unusual, and original.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />Biggest problem: no sequel..
B008LZHA3G|5.0|When I'd heard that Bob Dylan was releasing an album in September this past summer, I was stoked. Ecstatic. This was already a great year for music (with The Beach Boys, Van Halen, and Neil Young all releasing great albums this year), but it got a whole lot better when Columbia announced the release of 'Tempest.' I immediately pre-ordered my copy here on Amazon without thinking twice -- this was an album I was going to listen to for the duration of the year and really get into.<br /><br />So the day came, and I received the album. I had heard 'Duquesne Whistle' and snippets of a few other songs, and I had really liked what I heard. So, my expectations were relatively high for the album -- surely it wouldn't be as good as 'Together Through Life' or 'Modern Times,' but it was in all likelihood going to be a good album. I put the album on my speaker, shut my eyes, and just listened.<br /><br />\\"Wow\\" was the only word I could mutter when the album had ended. I sat in silence, stunned at the musical forcefield that was just bestowed upon me. Was it possible? At 71 years of age, has Dylan *really* created one of his best albums of his career? Maybe I was just so excited and so eager to have a new Dylan album to listen to that my judgment was being clouded. So I walked away and put the CD back into its cardboard sleeve and walked away for the night.<br /><br />The next day, I listened to it again. Same setting -- a dark room, eyes shut, and the speaker aimed directly towards me. Wouldn't you know it but I liked the album better the second time around than I did the first, which is really saying something. And I would continue to play it day after day after day after day. It then hit me -- Dylan HAS released an album that is on par with his best albums.<br /><br />Dylan's growl is as powerful and as moving as it has ever been. Here, Dylan tackles some great upbeat songs ('Early Roman Kings' is an incredible, Chicago-blues influenced piece of music -- it even \\"nicks\\" a bit or so from 'Mannish Boy,' the classic Muddy Waters cut) as well as some amazing slower songs ('Soon After Midnight' is the best ballad Dylan has done since 2006's 'Spirit on the Water').<br /><br />But the highlight on this album is most definitely the 13+ minute title track. 'Tempest' was written about the Titanic, and includes some great references to the 1997 James Cameron film (with Leonardo DiCaprio, the film's star, having a few subtle namechecks thrown in). 'Tempest' is right up there with some of the great Dylan epics -- 'Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands,' 'Idiot Wind,' 'Highlands' and obviously 'Brownsville Girl,' and the poetry used on this track is classic Dylan.<br /><br />A tribute to John Lennon is also featured. 'Roll on John,' not to be confused with the old folk song that Dylan covered very early on in his career (1961-1962, namely), is an extremely well-written tribute to the legendary Beatles member and it also features a few subtle references (namely a few lyrics from 'A Day in the Life'). The track is nearly 8-minutes, and Dylan's growl is on full display here.<br /><br />Part of what makes 'Tempest' interesting are the song lengths. Only two songs clock in under 5 minutes on the entire album, and half of the songs are over the 6-minute mark. The total time for the album is 68 minutes -- quite impressive for a man that is over 70-years old and is concluding his 51st year as a recording artist. The tracks are so well-performed, however, that they don't feel long. And that's what makes 'Tempest' great. It doesn't feel like a long album -- you'll get so immersed in the songs that before you know it, 68 minutes has come and gone. That is a testament to just how great an artist Bob Dylan is.<br /><br />Overall, if you have been hesitating to buy 'Tempest' (and I honestly have no idea why you would hesitate), get it immediately. This album (and I know this is a bold statement, but I sincerely believe it to be true) is a better album than 'Modern Times' and 'Together Through Life.' While both of those albums are masterpieces, this album is, hands down, among the best Dylan has ever recorded. And while I personally prefer \\"Love & Theft\\" (and judging how I feel about this album less than a month after its release, that could quickly change), that's not knocking this album in any way. 'Tempest' belongs in that elite group of Dylan albums -- 'Bringing it All Back Home,' 'Highway 61 Revisited,' 'Blonde on Blonde,' 'John Wesley Harding,' 'Blood on the Tracks,' 'Oh Mercy,' 'Time out of Mind,' etc. -- in essence, the \\"all-time classics.\\"<br /><br />Even if you are a casual fan of Bob Dylan, I can almost guarantee you you'll find something you like in 'Tempest.' There's something here for all Dylan fans. I cannot recommend 'Tempest' enough. I've got tickets to see Bob Dylan in Philadelphia on November 19 with Mark Knopfler (a long-time Dylan collaborator and Dire Straits' frontman), and boy, this CD has got me feeling pretty good about the quality of that show. Needless to say I'm psyched.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended. Not only one of Dylan's best albums of the 21st century (like I said, only \\"Love & Theft\\" beats it and only by a small margin), but one of the best albums to be released in the 21st century so far. Get this album immediately. You won't be sorry.

B007H1HQW0|4.0|This item is a bit tricky to assemble.  However, once you are past this drawback, the cutter does a decent job \\"scoring\\" your bottles. Read and re-read the instructions; otherwise you will not get a decent \\"score\\" line.  The blade cutter head needs to be checked at various intervals for excessive ware and then rotated to expose the next cutter head.<br />After your bottles are scored you will need to immerse your them in boiling hot water and then immersed in ice-water to achieve a clean break at your score line. read and re-read the instructions.  I use a pair of kitvhen tongs to retrieve glass from the hot water.  The bottle may split apart in either the hot or cold water. Don't expect to produce a \\"clean\\" break with every bottle. I feel lucky if I get 3 out of 5 bottles that have broken cleaning at the \\"score\\" line. The kit comes with sand paper for the edges along the break; not very much sandpaper.  The edges in most cases will be as sharp as a knife.  I'm currently cutting the tops and bottoms off wine bottles; end use will be candle holders.  Either, real candles or the battery operated type.
B007THA4FI|5.0|There is a lot of misery in this book, and no magic. The problems the characters face - poverty, addiction, abuse, mental illness, sudden death, infidelity, and many others - are relentless and cannot be fixed by the wave of a wand. That is one takeaway from this novel, along with the truth that we are all connected, whether we like it or not, and our moments of heart, of caring, even when imperfect, are all that stands any chance of healing the wounds of the world. That sounds cliche when I write it here, but as this novel unfolds, it comes forth as a deep truth slowly revealed, and is anything but cliche.<br /><br />Revolving between several different characters and households in the small town of Pagford, England, at first the novel seems to revolve around a dispute on the town council regarding the future of the Fields, - a low income housing area that falls within the town's boundaries, but that many would like to have redistricted and handed back to the neighboring city of Yarvil. The sudden death of the major advocate for keeping the Fields within Pagford's boundaries sends ripples throughout the town. The lives of all the characters in the book are affected, as they each face crises brought on directly or indirectly by his death, the resulting 'casual vacancy' on the council, and the impact the council's decisions may have on each of their lives. In the end, though, this book isn't really 'about' this town dispute over the Fields, and it is never fully resolved. The book explores the various social issues relentlessly, but is hardly a treatise for one view or the other, as all the characters and their views are messy, mixed bags - it's a world of grey hues rather than black and white.<br /><br />It is masterfully written though. The characters and scenes are vivid, and although it does start slowly, with a dizzying number of characters to track, if you stick with it, they all become crystallized and the story carries you along. It builds to a tragic crescendo, followed by an almost quiet denouement in which there does appear to be healing and hope for some, but not all. I admit I was hoping for more of a traditional happy ending, for a more straightforward emotional payoff in the end, or at least a sense that good had triumphed over evil, but it was not to be. This novel seems determined to keep us focused on real life, and real love, and the ups and downs that occur day to day amidst it. It is nuanced, and after sitting quietly for a bit after finishing it, I found I respected that, and the emotions it had made me feel and face.<br /><br />In any case, you should certainly not read it because you are or are not a fan of the HP novels, as it is a wholly different kind of book. I know Rowling has focused her charitable work on underpriviliged youth, and certainly that seems to have driven part of what came forth here. But she is also such a brilliant character-driven writer (perhaps the only thing this shares with the HP books), and with this book has indisputably earned the right to not be viewed solely as either a YA or fantasy author. This book is for mature adults, and those interested in reality, unvarnished.o, followed by an almost quiet denouement in which there does appear to be healing and hope for some, but not all.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|I have to admit I'm hooked on this series of books. Although the cast of characters is so large I need to reference the Wiki AWOIAF to keep them straight, the stories make it worth the extra effort.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I'm not sure how to rate this book, I gave it 3 stars, it's entretaing, and fast to read, however I woudn't say it's a great book, Its just a woman, very obssesed with this hot guy, I don't think in this book you really get to know Christian, its mainly about the physical attraction. Like I said I read it quite fast, but i'm not really impressed.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|A fun and game. I loved finding the clues and putting the whole mystery together. I highly recommend for everyone!

1423140605|4.0|Warning: there will be spoilers... for The Son of Neptune. I'll stay away (mostly) from Mark of Athena spoilers in this review, except to say that the book was good, entertaining, deep in parts, the plot was cohesive, and (with one notable exception), there was a lot of good character development.<br /><br />(Note: I don't think it's a spoiler to say that the book begins exactly as you know it will begin - with everybody meeting. Or to say that the book is told from four points of view, none of which happen to be Hazel's or Frank's.)<br /><br />For the most part, I really, really enjoyed this book. Got it 3 days ago, and have read it 3 times since then, in fact. Lots of great moments in the book. There was just one... little... issue... that prevented the book from being 5 stars.<br /><br />(Ok, I lied. There will be spoilers. Vague ones, but spoilers nevertheless. You have been warned.)<br /><br />...<br /><br />Remember Frank in The Son of Neptune? The guy who didn't find out what his family gift was until almost the very end of the book, and yet still managed to be cool... and useful... throughout the book? The guy who figured out how to win the Capture the Flag game at the beginning, against the odds? The guy who single-handedly defended Percy and Hazel against a group of fire-breathing basilisks (with the firewood in his pocket at the time, no less)? The one who, according to Mars, Gaea was most worried about? Whose gift from Mars is the fact that he's a brilliant tactician, and has a lot of bravery and a strong sense of duty? Who figured out how to get past a line of ogres surrounding his grandmother's house? Who burned his own lifeline to free Thanatos because, and I quote, \\"some things were worth dying for,\\" and later said that \\"if I'm going to burn, it might as well be bright\\"? Who came up with, and then implemented, the plan to defeat Alcyonus, and led the quest to victory?<br /><br />Yeah. FRANK did those things. And for the most part, he did them BEFOREhe figured out how to shapeshift. When I was eagerly awaiting Mark of Athena, I actually spent a lot of time anticipating how the team was going to deal with having TWO brilliant tacticians (assuming that Annabeth was one of the seven).<br /><br />And then the book came out. And whenever Frank came up in The Mark of Athena, I found myself stunned, and asking the question: What HAPPENED to him? Who is this person, and what has he done with Frank?<br /><br />Without seeing anything from his, or even Hazel's, POV, we're left in the dark about why Frank is so out of character. I can think of just a few possibilities:<br />1. Frank has shapeshifted into animals so many times, it's affected his mind. (I somehow doubt this is the case.)<br />2. For some reason, Frank has a master plan which requires that all of his friends see him as a cowardly idiot. (Kind of doubt it's this either; there's no such thing as a battle strategy that benefits from your friends seeing you as a cowardly idiot).<br />3. Frank is so intimidated by everybody else in the group, it has caused his mind to short-circuit so that it no longer works properly. This actually IS possible (as I can attest from vast personal experience), and it's even in-character for him (he was never terribly self-confident). But whether this is the case or not, the fact remains that this isn't what it LOOKS like to the reader. It just looks like Frank's a cowardly idiot. It look like option #4:<br />4. Riordan forgot who Frank was, and what makes him cool. He's not cool just because he can shapeshift. If that were the case, Frank would have been completely useless throughout most of The Son of Neptune... and he wasn't.<br /><br />...<br /><br />So that's the only thing keeping me from giving this book 5 stars. Frank isn't even my favorite character - if he were, it would be worse - but it was still so jarring to see him so utterly changed from the way he was in The Son of Neptune, that I can't, in good conscience, give it5 stars... even though it's otherwise an excellent book, and definitely left me very eager for the sequel. :)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great time consuming game. but I wish there were more coins without cost. all in all a lot of fun though

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This richly detailed game requires that you have a good wi-fi connection in order to download it to a Kindle Fire--and also that you relegate most of your other apps to off-device storage.  As noted in the description,  it's a whopping 273 MB. Some of this is undoubtedly due to a large number of video narrative sequences, which while hardly necessary do add visual appeal to the game.<br />  As in many (most?) games of the adventure / hidden object type,  there is a lot of navigation from one part of the game map to another. The designers of this game do a good job of keeping this from being too onerous by basically not allowing you to wander too far from the narrative line; new areas and puzzles do not become available until you have completed prerequisites.<br />  I played this game in normal mode,  which prevents the aggravating penalties or lockouts that often result from zooming a hidden-object scene (in many games, any touch on the screen registers as an incorrect click on an object. I wish programmers would routinely deactivate that feature as part of the process of adapting p.c. games for touch-screen devices, but few do.)  This, unfortunately, was linked to a little too much helpful clueing.  It would have been nice to have been able to turn OFF the &quot;look here!&quot; sparkles, while still retaining the ability to ask for hints and have the &quot;action available&quot; clues on the map.<br />  One nice touch in this game is that some of the hidden objects are tools and puzzle pieces to be used later in the game.  The h.o. puzzles also reflect the removal of components during the course of play.  Oh...and the puzzles generally make sense (no &quot;put the mustard on the cat&quot; kind of actions are needed), although the game requires that the proper tool be used for a task (no using a hammer to break open the box if you're supposed to use the ax) .  A number of novelty,  non-h.o. games add variety to the fun...and all can be skipped after a certain amount of time passes if they get too frustrating.<br />  This game was definitely a bargain at 99 cents.  Whether I'll pay full price for the sequel...well,  I'll at least see how much it is and consider it.
B0034EIVKK|4.0|Great album...raw, gritty, mostly spoken-word blues....his voice, backed by the pounding, yet sometimes ethereal rhythms, is like an guiding force that lets you reconcile with the cold hard truth of life's realities in a way that still leaves you feeling strangely contented.  The only issue I have with this album, and honestly, it's almost not worth mentioning since it's a very wholesome production, is paying full-album price for what essentially is an EP.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Although it doesn't have the scene changes and backdrops as the play, I loved watching every minute of it. There was so much passion, emotions by every singer. The Valjean quarter at the end was a great treat.

B005FISBTO|5.0|I LOVE Dexter.  I highly recommend this series - starting with season 1.  Excellent service and shipping as usual by Amazon.  I don't think you'll be unhappy with this series.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Absolutely riveting.  Could not put the book down and absolutely CANNOT GET ENOUGH.  Eva & Gideon's story beats Ana & Christian's in my mind, and Day has a wonderfully creative way of bringing this couple to life.  And can we say HOT?!

B007I1Q4W2|1.0|This movie was just awful! Had potential but failed. Weak storyline, bad acting, and at points in the movie your watching a animated comic book.
B005Z4LCZS|5.0|Takenoko is a bamboo farming game with gorgeous artwork and simple but stratetic gameplay.  I played a demo of this game at Gen Con 2012 and absolutely fell in love with it!  It takes about 15 minutes to teach and gameplay lasts about 30-45 minutes.  There are 3 types of objective cards and you'll get 2-3 actions a turn to try and organize, grow, and eat different colored bamboo.<br /><br />Gamers of all types will enjoy this game - My friends and I find that it offers a fun and more relaxing atmostphere compared to some of our more \\"intense\\" games like Eclipse, Mage Knight, or Lords of Waterdeep.<br /><br />When I received my game, both the yellow and green bamboo pieces were covered in some type of dirt (apparently there was an issue during the painting process).  I emailed Asmodee about getting replacements and they responded within 24 hours.  They had the new pieces shipped to me within a week - no hassle or questions asked.<br /><br />In short: Gorgeous art, fun gameplay, easy-to-learn rules, and great customer service.
B009329ZF2|4.0|I watch each movie without having read any reviews prior to have no assumptions or bias; this way I can watch the movie and I am either surprised in a good or bad way.<br /><br />In this case, I was entertained, the movie held my attention, the plot not overly complex, the action scenes and graphics realistic.<br /><br />The enemy, defense, weapons were nothing new but the strategy utilized during and toward the end was a testament to the way things were built to last and ultimately it is the oldest, least technical solution that overpowers the more technical alien race - as with all such movies we are far behind in every way imaginable.<br /><br />We are so far behind it is questionable as to why the highly advanced civilizations out there would waste their time.  This is different spin on how we defend and ultimately save the world once again and I found the movie to be sad, but also humorous.<br /><br />The movie has multiple emotional responses from extreme sad to romance and plenty of firepower and interesting weapons.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Coinciding with the 50th Anniversary when the very first James Bond film was released (October, 1962 with Dr. No) \\"Skyfall\\" is the 23rd installment of this extraordinary franchise and will feature the beautiful Daniel Craig in his 3rd outing as Bond.<br /><br /> Made on a budget of $150,000,000 (compare that to Dr. No's budget of $1,000,000!) the movie will be about the disappearance of Bond and questions as to whether M (James' boss and female commander) is capable of doing her job as the head of the secret Service.

B008NEVPCC|5.0|This CD is one of the BEST new albums to be released this year. Cher combines a variety of musical styles including dance,rap,rock, pop,and reggae to create a \\"pop album\\" with a very infectious sound. The album is brimming with attitude and swagger. There is an exciting edginess to the songs.<br /><br />Cher originally became known with her appearances on the UK version of the X-factor. (Being from the USA, I discovered her from watching her clips on Youtube.)<br /><br />You should know that there are a few different versions of this album. Some of the songs also appear in different versions on the USA edition. (\\"Want U Back\\" features teen rapper Astro who was one of the X-Factor USA finalists in last year's season one.)There is also a USA (Target Department Store) version that includes 2 additional bonus tracks (from the UK version).An exclusive Japanese version with a bonus track is being released later this month.<br /><br />According to Wikipedia and Digital Spy, a Deluxe 21 track version of this album is due to be released in the UK in November. (I can hardly wait!!)<br /><br />Bottom line- if you are looking for an album to feed your \\"music addiction\\"- an album containing infectious pop songs with an edge,attitude,and swagger- then this is the album to buy. Get it!
0307592731|5.0|When Cheryl Strayed was 22 years old her mother died. For four years Cheryl tried to come to terms with this death; neither infidelity, divorce to the man she loved, nor use of heroin filled the void. Four years later, after seeing a book on the Pacific Crest Trail, Cheryl embarked on a solo 1,100-mile hike of the PCT. [[ASIN:0307592731 Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail (Oprah's Book Club 2.0)]] is the narrative about this women's journey. Though the book is set on the PCT, the real challenge and focus of the book is Cheryl's healing.<br /><br />Cheryl is brutally honest about the physical challenges of the PCT as well as the internal pain and healing she undergoes. She reveals the aches and anguish, the fear and joys of facing that fear, her aloneness and camaraderie among fellow hikers, the perils both from nature, animals, and other humans.<br />If you are looking for a travel book about the PCT, this may not be the book for you. Cheryl's hiking inexperience is evident in the many ways she imperils herself, the extraordinary weight she backpacks, and the lack of planning. In spite of these avoidable hardships, Cheryl's determination to complete this journey is inspiring.<br /><br />If you enjoy reading about personal challenges and growth, this book is one you should not miss. I really liked how genuine Cheryl is in describing her past life and how she relates to the people in it. Life is never simple and Cheryl writes candidly about the complexity and ambiguity in the interaction between family members, especially the love-hate relationship with her mother.<br /><br />This is a brilliantly-written, well-edited book. Cheryl is a great wordsmith and riddles the book with turns of phases that I just loved, such as: \\"The trees were tall, but I was taller;\\" \\"My hunger was a numb finger, barely prodding;\\" \\"She was not so much high as down under;\\" and \\"Nothing did. Nothing would. Nothing could every bring my mother back to me or make it okay that shewas gone.\\"<br /><br />The story moves quickly; I continued to turn pages late into the night, captivated. I highly recommend this book.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|As a former history teacher, I appreciated the author's attention to historical facts.  They were expertly woven into the story line.  Follet's research was evident and I learned some details I hadn't previously considered.<br />Of course the actual story was enjoyable.  I appreciated the interweaving of character stories from the first volume with those in this book.  Some of the plots were a little stretched as each character was involved in obvious historical positions.  Still, this is after all, fiction.<br />I found myself unable to put the novel aside and I read it over two days.  I highly recommend it!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|The movie was great and has led me to want to read the book and can not wait until they make the next movie in the series.  Great story line.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I was sorely disappointed with this book.  I am not an avid HP fan but enjoyed the books and the movies.  I was well aware prior to purchasing that this would be a book for adults.  However, I expected an R rating, not a XXX.  There was really no way to know how objectionable the content could be prior to purchasing.  I gave her 2 stars for being an exceptional writer but other than that could find nothing redeeming about this book.  There is simply no reason to stuff every political-social-economic topic available into 500 pages of print.  The characters were polarized, not dynamic the way most people really are (ex. Snape), with their good and bad qualities. Many reviewers may object, but I feel like JKR does have somewhat of an obligation to consider the audience that brought her so much success.  Those who say she should be allowed to just follow her \\"creative muse\\" are those who like it.  Also what about the HP readers transitioning into adulthood who pick up this book?  It is being sold by the cash registers in my local BJ's!!  There should be a sticker on the cover indicating strong adult themes.  In addition no excerpts were offered of the book so that the reader could get an idea of what they were getting into.  Many authors offer that prior to the book being released.  All-in-all, I felt duped. And yes, I object to the Kindle price - probably determined by her publisher (I am not sure).  It seems somewhat disingenuous for a women who gained her early success while on welfare, to now be charging an arm and a leg for a book, much more than most authors, for a book with controversial content.  I am an avid reader, and spend thousands of dollars a year stocking up my kindle.  I looked forward to this book with much anticipation and it fell far short of anything I expected.<br /><br />I returned this e-book to Amazon due to the content and they accommodated my request.  I commend them for always providing excellent service and always striving to make sure eachcustomer has a positive experience.

B00008PX8P|5.0|This Led Zeppelin DVD was my first purchase with Amazon. I initially was impressed that it arrived much sooner than I expected. Not to mention, the quality was great, so I watch it everyday. I have been honing my guitar techniques, and this DVD has definitely helped me to do this. So whether you are a guitar player or just a music lover, I highly suggest purchasing this DVD set. I am very satisfied with my purchase with Amazon.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|This is a very powerful book. Disturbing, enlightening. A look at North Korea that most people would never know about. Certainly heightened my awareness of the situation in North Korea.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Not the best written book but still an amazing read, though I would call it more romance than erotic !!! :)
B0064UPU4G|5.0|This is such a fun album with plenty of high-energy tunes, great for dancing.  I've loved every song they released as a single and wonder why it took me so long to finally purchase an album.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Snow White and the Huntsman was a nearly perfect movie.  Charlize Theron was amazing as usual.  As was Chris Hemsworth.  His fake Irish accent didn't go over too well, but his performance was excellent.  Another highlight for me was the seven dwarves.  I loved the new take on their life style, and the actors were very well chosen.  The only drawback for me was Kristen Stewart's acting.  I will say this in her favor, however, she did seem to put forth more effort in trying not to be so wooden.  But it is painfully obvious that she is trying.  I'm not sure if it's lack of confidence or what, but she always seems very unsure of herself.  I do hope that she is able in time to grow into a more mature and confident actress.  But for now, I would love to have seen the movie with a more adept actress playing the part of Snow White.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I loved this movie because the characters seemed genuine, the setting was exotic, and the viewer learns something about how travel can change people, mostly for the better. I also loved the enthusiasm of the main Indian character who runs the hotel. The movie is both funny and sweet(definitely sweet in a good way).
B0087HT36U|5.0|I got this for my grandkids, but we have played it through at least three times.  they really enjoy beating me any time they can. highly recommend, at least as fun as angry birds.
B009AJDDQU|4.0|It was a good movie. Wish it felt more like an \\"Alien\\" movie. Don't want to give more away. I would recommend watching it with the the mindset that it's a movie not a complete prequel of the series.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Just love this. It is great for all ages to play. Like the different<br />colors. Not soooo challenging that you loose interest.

145162607X|2.0|This book was disappointing to me. If you are looking for a well-written story involving these characters, try Sharon Kay Penman's SUNNE IN SPLENDOR. It's a thick book but well worth the effort. The characters are more well developed and the storyline has much more depth.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am on pinterest all the time and I love how simple this app makes it. I don't log out since this is on my Kindle so I don't about not letting you log back in but I am going to assume its more to do with the device rather than the app. So no problems here!!
1439153663|5.0|I can't even begin to tell you how much I loved this book.  It's beautifully written.  It tears at the heart at every turn. Set on a plantation run by slaves who are more in command of their lives than their owners, this story brings to light the appalling conditions of slave life and the triumph and heartbreak inherent in that life.
B0013SQP66|5.0|breaking bad is quite entertaining, to me, i enjoy the transformation of Walter's character.<br /><br />worth the money, easily. i recommended it to all my family members.
B005HSL626|3.0|I wish it had a update it fun but can get really boring I if you have nothing to do this is your app
B004HUE57S|5.0|Recommend the  Vertical Mouse for anyone who uses the computer more than 1 hour/day. Easy to install, easy to get used to and it has allowed me to continue computer work inspite of wrist and hand issues.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|A wonderful show dynamic in its range while maintaining a level of comprehensiveness. The cast was clearly top notch most, if not all, coming out of the British theater all of them with the greatest of credentials. The story line was magnificent with themes of redemption, the dynamics of continued growth in life, and best of all freedom in its most complex and diverse manner.This is indeed a story to be watched by anyone but especially those who may be in the fall of their lives.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|A little bit of everything... funny, spooky, quirky and all around entertaining flick. People thought it was going to be some rolled out modern day version of Dark Shadows the cheesy TV show ...its not, it was its own creation based on existing characters. It is its own entity and very amusing! We all enjoyed it and recommend it if you want a few laughs. Enjoy!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. If u have a Pinterest account this is the best one. I use this on a Kindle Fire and it works great. Also it lets u create a pin.
B00846REIS|5.0|Love this story!!  Eva & Gideon, a couple who share the same horrible connection of being abused as a child, are able to come together to find love.  Syliva Day does a great job at describing the strength of their love and attraction to one another.  Completely addicted from page 1!  Can't wait to see how their story continues!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I‘m not a sci-fi fan, mainly because most of it is too foreign to me, however, this is written to be an easy read and crystal clear to understand.  Thank you for this series, I look forward to reading the 6th book in this series and many of your other books.  This series deserves nothing less than 5 stars.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I'd been looking forward to seeing this movie for a long time. The concept of a group of senior citizens moving from the UK to live in a hotel in modern day India, appealed to me.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of Judi Dench and I loved how her character changed from being sad (before she left the UK) then taking on new challenges, and how she fared. They all had different reasons for going to India.<br /><br />At first the retirees found it difficult to adapt, and the hotel not quite as they expected, but most of them got into the swing of things. As one of them said you have to go with the flow.<br /><br />I don't want to give any of the story away, but something sad happened on the 45th day of their stay, I was watching the movie to cheer me up! By the end of the movie I'd almost forgotten and I felt happier.<br /><br />I'm glad I bought the movie. It was good to see Judi and the other actors British actors I hadn't seen for a long time. It was also nice to get a glimpse of what it's like there today.
B00004YRQA|5.0|I ordered a regular ps2 8mb memory card (with magicgate) and lo and behold i opened my package to see a 16mb memory card(with magicgate). It works well. thumbs way up! The only downside is that ps2 games are not being made anymore so i have alot of attic space and not many games to fill it with. oh well
B004LQI1PA|4.0|I thought this was an amazing show.  My only reason for not giving it 5 stars was because they used one of the Jonas brothers as Marius.  The other stars were incredible.  And the surpise ending was fabulous.  As far as the technical side of things, didn't have a problem at all.
B0094ZJK4O|5.0|This third solo album by Richie is probably his best.  Not because of his skill as a guitarist (that has already been established) but more because it was a look at who he is.  Given his issues over the last 7-8 years, I think he has used this album as a sounding board for his recovery.  I like all his albums a lot but this is a very personal look into his journey.  If you don't know him or have never heard his stuff, it's still a great record.  Check it out.
0525953728|5.0|Great book. It was hard to put down!  Nice to see what really happened over there from the first person perspective.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I have been a Percy Jackson follower since i was 9 and i still live all the books. i thought that the point of view would be from all 7 characters, and the book would make close to no sense, but it was only four of the seven. Pipers point of veiw was pointless, because all she didi was.worry
B007MB5OCE|3.0|I purchased this book knowing that it was off the wall, and it certainly was.  I found parts of it truly funny, but it was as if someone sat down to right a story and threw in every absurd idea he could come up with.  I would not recommend this book to someone else, unless I knew that they could find the humor in the story.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|RUSH-First time I saw my mates was when they played front band to some new band called KISS? Rushes first album had me sold that these guys from Canada with a vocalist who seemed to sound like Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin but at the same time did not would be hot and around 4 awhile, By 1978 I'd seen them 5 times as they played as the Headliner at the Long Beach Arena and this new album called Hemispheres (my personal favorite, yes I am older). After picking up #2 4 row center tickets for Rushes November 21st Concert in San Diego I bought the new CD in an MP3 download, my honest opinion? It RIPS!!! Have it on in the living Room at 1/2 volume blasting through my Polk Audio in walls/ 12inch active Sony SUB 5.1 and its shaking the house. Ok guys and gals track 5 eh hum, Song called CARNIES-The Alex Riff is god like incredible after all these years. I was cruising down the road with my $3000 system in my truck this comes on and I almost drove off of the road!!! It just keeps getting better!! RUSH I love U guys and am so blessed U never Conformed to the sounds of the times but followed your creative abilities and continue to do so for over the last ? 40 Years almost, ROCK ON mates and please take a breather soon U have been touring for 2 years straight. Please play at my funeral when it comes La Villa Strangiato?<br />anyone interested in a ticket to RUSH I have 2......
B0000AUHPK|5.0|Wuthering Heights is one of my favorite reads of all time. Loved the updated movie. Bronte sisters works are my favorite.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|You wouldn't think a game this simple would be so addictive bit for some reason it is. Crashes a bit too much to be five stars.
B007I1Q4W2|5.0|I must admit to everybody that this isn't your typical your zombie film. It is heavy on the Drama, it could have possibly been written as an AMC DRAMA TV Show. ( YES I know the Walking Dead is already in existence* I am a massive fan of that show as well! )The reason I say that is because it has alot of Story but unfortunately it has to be compressed into a Movie Time Frame, But it is that type of film, a Drama/Thriller if you were to ask me. It has its action scenes and it also shows its low budget here and there. But for the Most part this film was awesome. Again if you like Zombie-Comedies or Zombie-Action then this probably isnt' for you. I definetly enjoyed it and I purchased it as well<br /><br />Cheers!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was awesome!!! In the first book I did see the similarity to the 50 Shades book, but this second book was not like that. I found myself actually crying in a couple of places in the book. I loved it from beginning to end, I just hated it that it ended. I can't wait for book 3. I hope it comes out soon because I can't wait to find out what happens next.
B0091XRRQC|5.0|My kids liked this movie.. But I found it was more for the adult kids than my little kids. With some of the content was directed at adults not children. Fun movie overall...
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Another very good Reacher book by Lee Child. He consistently puts out a good book every year and I for one am very happy about it. Thanks Lee, and I can't wait for the next one!
0763644765|4.0|Unfortunately, this book hasn't helped in potty training, yet. But my daughter loves it and always tells the main character to not go in his diaper. If only she would take the same advice for herself.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I watched the movie and enjoyed every line in this book. The other two books are definitely a \\"must read\\"
B008M87GJK|5.0|I love being able to get the news of the world on the bbc news for kindle. I work evenings and miss the morning and evening news programs on TV, not that they are of much use since too much time is spent on the sensational and not enough on what is happening all over the world. I listen to the BBC on the radio on my way home from work at 0030, but since my drive is only 15 minutes, I don't get enough. Thanks for a broad, enlightened, and informative edition.
B00943SQCI|1.0|Absolutely don't bother wasting your time!!  If you want to enjoy your evening, then pick another movie.  It was not worthy of Johnny Depp!!!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. it is amazing. there is so many cool ideas.<br />I think that everyone should have it.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|i have been following percy jackson since i was twelve but now i am seventeen and latley i have been getting tired of the same semi happy endings. but wow rick riordan you suprised me i love that the story is getting darker and i cant wait for the next book. high hopes for next book.
B004KPLZKA|5.0|This is a good CD. I like the parts with the her British accent rapping the best. Cher L. has a good range and on a few songs shows us some of it. I like the CD and would recommend you but it. The catchy little hooks at the beginning of some of the tracks are cute and will get stuck in your head.
B0076WFTS8|5.0|The birth and begining of Dr Feelgood.Wilko at his very best the whole band developing into the magneficent beast<br />that every incarnation of latter Feelgoods would be compared to.Lots of tracks that did nt appear on albums,love the stuff with Pirates mick green.Yet it is the DVD THAT REALLY makes this package, watching the power and energy of the Feelgoods is something else.Great Value Get Rockin
0525953728|5.0|Great book! Must read. Cool seal 1st hand account written for anyone and eveyone to understand. Even with PG-13 consideration. Really shows it's tough to be a Seal, but also reveals how it is the most cost effective and safest tactic for global communities; when a terrorist resides amongst general public of any country. Am hoping this is made into a movie VERY SOON![[ASIN:0525953728 No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden]]
B005OZE9SA|5.0|I´m not a profesional musician. I´m very happy with it. I having a good time and it helps me to \\"feel\\" the sounds
B008Y2IU12|4.0|Good plot,fabulous costume designs. The movie was left open to interpretation as to if or when there will be a sequel.Relationships were left dangling. Would like to see the plot finished in a sequel.
B003FSTN6Q|5.0|In this last Season which I did not know existed we have it all Melinda loses Jim in tragic circumstances and then get him back (I will not say how as this will spoil it for other people who would like to watch) they then go on to have a child and he powers are greater again than Melinda's but it is good to see that good wins over evil in the end you just have to watch to believe there is life after death.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|If you love the movie, you will love the book. This book gives great back story and allows you more insight to the characters and relationships.
0525953728|4.0|This book provided excellent insight into the role of the Seals.  Despite Pentagon concerns, it did not disclose information that was not already in the public domain.  The specific description of the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden offered clarity to what actually happened, refuting the rumors and speculation that had been reported in the media.  Descriptions of other Seal operations provided further insight into the risks and constant pressure that Seals and other members of the military constantly face.  This was a very good book and I recommend it to everyone.
B009329ZF2|5.0|There was alot of hype when this movie was coming out at the big screen. Seeing it in video format was outstanding so I must assume that the big screen version was great. Was very impressed with the slant and inclusion of older veterens. Very well done.
0307341550|4.0|I didn't even read the summary before I just started reading (I just finished her latest book, Gone Girl)  and this book was a lot darker than I expected.  I absolulely love the writer's style, though, and she definitely kept me interested from start to finish.  I was a little disappointed that the ending happened so suddenly.
B009329Y30|5.0|Great date movie. Watched it with my mom. We are both in love with Zac Efron now. Would recommend it
B008M9PHWM|5.0|He is like old blues man.Great touch of life.There is all history of blues,country,jazz,I like it.Voice like Howling Wolf,Sadnes of Hank Williams and other great country artists at 40;s 50;s  and so on.This is great album,dont forget the past,but live the present!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I play the game with my kids and we have so much fun with it! Even my 5 year old can play. The challenges adapt to all ages. Beware though..it can be addicting!
1451648537|4.0|I had put off buying this biography of Steve Jobs because he, his company, and most importantly, this book, have been hyped to the point of nausea. However, I am very glad that I finally broke down and bought it. I read it on the plane to and from the US recently and it was fascinating. Walter Isaacson interviewed numerous people surrounding Jobs as well as Jobs himself to give a brutally honest picture of Steve Jobs and how be built Apple, twice, his failure with Next, and his triumph with Pixar. According to the author, Steve Jobs told him to write what he wanted and that Jobs wouldn't intervene. And from what I can tell, he did not. The biography traces his family history, his childhood, college, and every aspect of his life and more importantly his personality. What was a bit sad was that there are a several quotes from people who believe (or believed) that Apple without Jobs would eventually fade away. Even Steve Jobs is quoted as saying that Tim Cook was not a product guy, which he felt Apple needed to survive, but then again, he chose Cook as his successor. This seems more to me to be, cause there was no one else. I highly recommend this, regardless of what you think of Apple or Steve Jobs.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Jack Reacher has a knack for walking into trouble.  Yet, he never walks away. A drifter with a conscience. Ruthlessly efficient. Doggedly determined.  I have read them all and haven't found one I didn't like.
B008XBHIEY|5.0|What a great movie!  I realized that I had never seen this movie and watched it with friends who have seen it multiple times!  It's a great movie to watch for the first time or the 10th!  A classic, for sure!!!
030758836X|5.0|I would recommend this book to everybody! Entertaining as well as intelligent I will also pass it on to a friend! Thank you!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a great game I like that you have to unlock the different games and you can replay the different games as many times as you want
B005HSG3VK|3.0|I like the fact that the cover is light weight and durable.  The problem that I have with it is that the grooves in the pink shell are not quite deep enough to support the weight of the Kindle and it collapses occasionally.  Otherwise, it's a good cover.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, in fact couldn't put it down!  It was well written and the story line kept you in suspense right until the end!
B008DYZKQE|4.0|This book is obviously just a scan from the original book, the pictures and text do not zoom. This makes it hard to read.  However the book itself is great, and I recommend it to everyone.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like the plans it gives you choices and makes it convenient with verses and encouragement in an easy to use format.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The game is really easy to use.  I play it just about every night.  I do not like having to skip the ads every time it starts up but free is free and the ads only take a second to get out of once you see where the x is or where skip is.  I like it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I didn't think I would like it but I find myself going back to it over and over. it is s good time waster when I don't want to think about what I a doing to much.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|very easy to play, no directions needed. also like that i dont have to buy coins in order to advance like in other games
0525953728|5.0|Did your curiosity alarm go off when you observed the mad dash to take credit for taking the life of another human being? I wanted to know more than the outpouring of the spinners competition. \\"No Easy Day\\" helps by laying out a diary of the men who perform such tasks. It places a lot of emphasis on the type of men that are willing to torture themselves with the endurance preparations needed for 'messy work' such as this. \\"Exposed\\" in this book are details of the kind of extensive planning that prepared the team for the mission. These details came closer to common sense than to divulging the countries secrets. I would hope all our military missions have personnel risk reduction as a consideration.<br /><br />What came through to me loud and clear was the dedication these guys have to each other and to the country. They know it without even having to talk about it. Its evident in those few minutes of plan execution when some elements didn't go as planned. They still did their job. They all got out alive. No, I didn't learn any more about what other 'stealth' modifications were made to the choppers. A very experienced pilot losing control begs the question as to whether any 'stealth' mods affected flight characteristics. The pilot is no dummy but he may have been up against untested territory. Yes, I am convinced more than ever that these guys messed up Osama's face pretty bad. They deserve the credit. Notice,I said \\"THEY\\". No \\"ME's\\" in this book.<br /><br />The book reads like a thriller if you like that venue. As such, its hard to put down for a reading pause. Yep, its language 'salty'.
160774273X|5.0|Just as the other in depth 5 star reviews stated, this is a wonderful book.<br /><br />Yes there are not a zillion recipes, but that is precisely the point.  You don't need a zillion bread recipes to define a great bread book.  The key is to learn the process, understand the materials you are working with and how to manipulate those materials for the best results.  And that is precisely what Ken Forkish does in his book.<br /><br />Not only has Ken improved upon Lahey and Robertson's (Tartine) books, his method is broken down into comprehendable steps in which he explains the process of making not good, but great bread at home.<br /><br />The dutch oven or combo cooker method is probably the best home oven method to recreate artisian breads.<br /><br />Having a library of many bread books as it is my passion to bake bread, I have learned from Reinhart, Rose Levy Berenbaum, Hamelman, Leader, Amy's Bread, Bertinet, Hitz, Clayton,  etc...<br /><br />However, Ken's detailed instructions will make his book a regular go to for bread baking.  In addition to detail in description, Ken gives times for each part of the process. This is very helpful when you have to plan your bread baking around your lifestyle.<br /><br />Ken also shares how he got into becoming a baker, from his prior career and how he learned to bake.  His love of bread baking is evident.  Ken's personal story makes his book much more interesting.<br /><br />Like Amy's Bread autobiographical information contained in both editions, Ken not only shares his art, but his passsion.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|The story has a good start, interesting characters, good writing but the plot takes a wide turn into improbability.  Then my interest wained.  OK airplane book.
0525953728|5.0|The book was excellent.  An easy read and enough action to make you want you to continue reading but not so much detail that it bogged down.  I started it on a Friday afternoon and finished it the next day in the afternoon.  College football on TV didn't stand a chance in diverting my attention from reading the book.
0670023329|5.0|I'm almost finished but I thought I'd go ahead and say it's hard to put down. There are times I felt it could have been written better but the story overall has really opened up my eyes to North Korea in general.<br /><br />Personally, I'm interested in reading stories about politics and concentration camps so if you find those stories inspiring, I highly suggest reading this one.<br /><br />About 4 stars for writing and 5 stars for the story.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great Book ! This book will give you \\"Some Idea\\" what these people do, And the hours put in as far as training; to protect our country & and it's people. It's really to bad that they have a Boss named Obama!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Definitely a great time killer! I wish there was a way to get more coins though. A lot of fun.
B0058PJ6NE|1.0|what happend to the free one :(  someone make a free youtube with no history ive djdb djdbf ffjfbr rbrh
B007TMON8M|4.0|Like several other physics-based games that are popping up all over, SimplePhyics presents screen after screen of problems that you need to solve, using just a few \\"props\\", and applying the laws of physics.  It's quick to learn, and the puzzles are solvable with a bit of trial-and-error.  (Sometimes you just have to do the same thing in a very minutely different way to get it to solve.)<br /><br />I'm still waiting for an Android version of The Incredible Machine!  Now *that* was a \\"physics-based game\\"!!
B0098VXBIA|1.0|I had maybe one laugh during this movie. I guess if you are a woman it might be mildly entertaining, but for a guy it was a total snooze fest and actually I would have not watched it except for the fact that the wife wanted to.
B00571F26Y|5.0|You  might never eat bread again after reading this book!  I don't know if his scientific facts are true, but if they are, wheat is now a poison, changed over recent years by bioengineering and cross-breeding that produce unknown proteins that our bodies don't know how to deal with.  Very scary book!
B0087HT36U|2.0|stage 2-4.  a bonus gold stage is impossible on my phone.  I cannot throw the fire item until well after it is too late.  fix this.
0525953728|5.0|The book was fascinating and very insightful - too bad the current administration got in the way and did not allow the information obtained from Bin Laden's files to be used in an effective and timely manner so that Bin Laden's subordinates and their vast monetary funds could have been captured or eliminated and the funds confiscated.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|OK...better than I expected after movie reviews.  Parts of  it dragged, but the action sequences and special effects were pretty good.
B00846REIS|1.0|I wouldn't recommend this book although descriptions about life and work in the city seemed quite vivid, the plot was rather thin and an excuse for repeated descriptions of sex scenes.  Conflict wasn't fully explored and left the reader hanging although this  certainly  did not apply to the male protagonist!
B000ID37RM|5.0|Watched this with my teenager who recently read the book.  She was quoting the story as it went along, it was great.
B0086700CM|5.0|Some people say it lags. Well it lags because you have to many apps on your device. I may only be 12 but I know what lag is and how to fix it. Just delete some apps you never use.  It doesn't lag for me.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|After reading the Fall of Giants I couldn't wait for the Winter of the World to be released.  It sure did meet my expectations, I could hardly put it down.  The history along with the ficional characters made for a great read.  Each character was well developed and Follett made it seem like you were there with them.  Can't wait for the last of the Trilogy!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is so addicting it very simple but you really just want to finish the puzzles! you don' t have to buy anything to play which is nice!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow....I guess that's pretty much all I can say. I is a very descriptive book. I definitely did enjoy it because it is a wonderful yet strange love story. I totally recommend it!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Jodi delivers again with this book and leaves you thinking about what you might do.  It is definitly worth the price!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love the graphics, scenery, & background.  It didn't disappoint.  I finished it in a few days & I want more!
B008673ZAQ|2.0|I have to say that I was really disappointed with the second book in this series.  I expected there to be way more exotic encounters and crazy situations, but it only focused on both of them struggling to get past their own demons to find a way to even be somewhat remotely be able to be around each other.  I didn't like the whole part about Nathan and Gideon's way of dealing with him.  It just seemed really illogical that someone would have tolerated his really bad behavior.  I also think that if you're going to have a series...you need to publish the second book closer to the first book so that people know where the heck everything is starting from.  I think it was about six months since I first read Bared to You and upon starting to read this book I had no idea how much time had elapsed from the end of the first book.  I had honestly hoped that it wouldn't start immediately where it left off (and because I had to wait so long for the second book I had to brush up with the first book to even understand the time frame, but even then the rush of anticipation I had felt ending the first book was gone because it had been SO LONG since I read it waiting for the second book)....which was where Eva walks in on a foursome in her apartment with Cary.  I thought that it would have at least started a few months down the road in their relationship and summarized the prior ending of the last book to give everything a little bit of context.<br /><br />For some reason I still have hope that the third book will be back up to the Bared to You's standards....so if I remember I will download that book when it FINALLY becomes available.<br /><br />UGH...so disappointing to wait all this time and THIS is what I waited for!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I have the regular, Rio, & Space versions as well, and Seasons is my favorite due to the beautiful, detailed graphics.  The game is harder than the other versions.
B007SGM084|5.0|The trilogy is amazing.  I know that the first book is a little hard to get through because it is disturbing, but I think it really sets the stage for the entire series and you just have to plow through it (no pun intended).  Very well written and I have yet to find another series that is comparable in the level of detailed and explicit writing that this series is.  The character development is spectacular and you can really understand and feel the emotion of both of their personalities.<br /><br />My only criticism is that there is only a snippet in the end of the third book from Christian's point of view.  I would LOVE to read the entire series again from his point of view!!!  I hope that's up for consideration...but probably after the movie.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|I thought it was well acted and enjoyed the mix of the old and new story line. The cg of the enchanted forest , fairies, and dwarves was exellent. Snow left a little to be desired,kinnda stiff,but Charlise was great as the Queen. Fun but the formula is a bit tired.
B007RTAR64|5.0|I bought this doll for my best friend and when it shipped to me I opened the box to make sure it wasn't damaged it was perfect I was so happy I wrapped it gave it to my friend and she loved it so I wanna say thanks to amazon for taking good care if it while it was being shipped 😀THANK YOU!!!!!!
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|I loved this movie. You know that feeling when you're just starting a relationship? When every look is fraught with meaning, every sentence analyzed for double entendre? That's this movie. That giddiness oozes from the entire first half of the movie. It doesn't hurt that the cast list reads like a list of my favorite under appreciated actors. The stars, the beautiful Zoey Deschanel and JGL are both starting to get some recognition... but years after this movie. One of my favorites.
0545101425|5.0|Enjoyed the politics of the story. Sad how we can become sheep in a pen when government has too much control. Even though the \\"Capitol\\" had come up with an alternate way to control the districts through The Hunger Games the satyr on talk show hosts, reality TV and the mindless masses that fail to grasp the sick truth about their lives and their government can't be missed. Well read, and filled lots of drivetime.
0385742886|4.0|In The Kill Order James Dashner writes a thrilling, heart pounding prequel explaining about the sun flares and the disease called the flare. I would recommend reading Maze runner, The Scorch Trials and The Death Cure first because it will give the reader a sense of what happens after and then they can connect knowledge gathered from the previously written books and apply it. This novel kept me on the edge of my seat and clinging to each word throughout the entire book. The only reason why I gave this story four stars instead of five is because I felt cheated with the ending and that the author could have explained it slightly better instead of being so abrupt. If you enjoyed the rest of this series then I would recommend this book to you.
B0095R64AO|3.0|I tried watching this show with my wife.  While there were some funny parts in it, I was not very impressed and feel asleep about 25 minutes in.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I found that Calengoo synced with my Kindle in an instant.  Works great for me!<br />No problem entering on the Google Calendar and receiving it on the Kindle.  I love the \\"Agenda.\\"

B008JAGZDE|1.0|I thought I was going to love this movie.  I know it has crude humor I was prepared but not for this.  It was too over the top for me and I didn't enjoy it.  There were a couple of parts that you will laugh at regardless of liking it or not but it just fell flat it was the same jokes that they have used before and I enjoy many of these actors/actresses but it was a huge disappointment from beginning to end.  Would not would not even give it a start of you could rate something ZERO!!!  Sorry American Reunion I'm not normally this critical cause I love movies and will watch just about anything but this movie was not it.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|Nikki Heat and Rook have a childish chemistry in the book. The show is much better written. Can't say I'd buy another one from this series. Just sort of a boring book with very little action and suspense.
B0000CAQ27|5.0|Once again she did it amazing cd every song on this cd is incredible.Just like All her other cd's  love it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I have enjoyed everything Ken Follett has written, and I will recommend this book.  My only objection is that it became a soap opera on several levels that tried my patience.
B005TZFZJC|5.0|worth every penny, Rihanna  is amazing, you won't go wrong with this cd, every song is great. absolutely love it!!!!!!!!!!

B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child continues the adventuresome life of Jack Reacher into current day terrorist financing. Fast moving- a pleasure to read
0385738773|4.0|The last book of the Maze Runner Trilogy has left me statisfied. This book was full of action and suspense and major twists. I thoroughly enjoyed going through this journey with Tom. Although I was satisified with the ending of the trilogy, I felt it lacked some major pizzazz. But all in all, I enjoyed it!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|this is an easy review...pre-order the blu ray...seen it three times at the show enjoyed every outing. gona be amazing on my 65 inch screen...yea if u dont have a huge tv buy one off Amazon, lets stimulate the economy...yes

B005MMYC7I|5.0|The Blue Ray arrived fast, when I opened it, I was so thrill to seen that the case and disks were in excellent shape, The resolution was awesome and best of all, I was happy because they were also translated and subtitle in Spanish.
1250006341|4.0|Written as a companion piece to the first couple of seasons of Downton  Abbey this book apparently came out prior to the second season so it doesn't give away much if you've not yet watched it. There's a lot of detail on the series production, quotes from cast and crew on the series, plenty of photographs and even a lot of historical background detail (some of it not actually used in episodes ) to help the viewer / fan understand just why or how something was done.<br /><br />This book is well worth owning even if you have only an interest in the historical  aspects and could care less about the series itself.<br /><br />A sequel book is due out soon, \\" The Chronicles of Downton Abbey a New Era\\", it should be even better.

B00000I3JM|4.0|The Blue Nile were one of the 1980s more \\"under the radar\\" bands. Great music that never reached the masses. Then again, maybe that's for the best, or they would have ended up sounding like Simple Minds. Not that that's bad, but this album and their one, \\"Hats\\" were splendid sets of mesmerizing, soothing, reflective, and inspiring songs. Keyboards and synthesizers blended together like a delicious, sweet confection. I still like \\"Hats\\" a bit more than this debut, but that's just a personal bias. Nothing remotely mediocre about this album whatsoever. Songs like \\"Tinseltown in the Rain\\" and \\"Stay\\" still sound powerful nearly 30 years after they were released.

B007PF7MGS|5.0|This is a very informative book on starches.  I had always believed that a person should be careful of the starches they eat in food.  I would highly recommend  this book.
B007REW8DO|4.0|Loved the lyrics and the sound of Christina's voice. She has a very nice writing and singing style that continues to bring you back for more. THis is music that you can listen to over and over again.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a really fun game that will get you hooked in a hurry!  It starts out simply enough, and just when you think it is too easy, bam! you hit a real challenge!  Very enjoyable.
B007THA4FI|1.0|What a disappointment.  Stock characters. No recognizable hero/heroine. No creativity. Nothing special. Save your money, and don't waste your time on this very ordinary book by an author who wrote an extraordinary series.<br />J.k. Rowling should have quit while she was ahead. No mas!!
B003UBTX7C|5.0|I thought the book was wonderful. I like the Camel Club in any thing they do. Keep Oliver alive for a lot more storries. David Baldacci is a wonderful story teller.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|I LOVE this album. Frank Ocean is a genius. Buy this album.<br />Buy this album.<br />Buy this album.<br />Buy this album.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|I purchased a sound machine that does not have as many sound selections available as Relax Melodies.  This app provides the most calming & relaxing sound selections.  I highly recommend this app.
0525953728|5.0|I like factual accounts of intense moments, and how people react to stress, such as in  combat, police work, spy work, etc.  This was an excellent novel.  I believe the author was factual, and without the emphasis on him.  I enjoyed it.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is the best and most wonderful game I have ever had on my kindle fire.I play it on my grandmas phone but love it on my kindle fire!I use it every day.Thank you to who made this app.
B0072GPPNC|5.0|Loved this movie when I went to the theatre and still love it now.  It is very moving.  The horse(s) used were amazing and the photography was excellent.
B000OV85AW|4.0|My husband and I are going to Devil's Island on a cruise in February.  By availing ourselves of this product, we feel well prepared to know what went on at this hellish location in the early 1900's.
0385344333|2.0|It seems to be the trend to write a lot of words. To much driving all over no where. More Reacher, less words about nothing. All the recent favorites have fallen into pages of words. Are they paid by the word?
0061692042|3.0|I loved the first three quarters of the book and then he let the story die. I wanted to know what happened to the characters.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love this game so glad I'm not losing my real money. lol!! it is so much fun trying to unlock tbd other games by getting puzzle pieces.
B004GYY714|5.0|Five stars! I highly recommend it. Anything that you can think of on the radio - this app will have it.
0307341550|5.0|\\"Sharp Objects\\" was the kind of book that you pick up and don't want to put it down. It had lots of interesting and quirky charcters who really had you wondering if they had ulterior motives. The ending was a shock - which I always love in a book.
0307730697|5.0|My husband asked me to buy this for him.  He's not much of a reader (more of a TV guy) so I happily obliged.  He literally couldn't put it down - he absolutely loved it.  Though I didn't read it yet, he mentioned I would definitely enjoy it, as the author is a very spiritual person (as I am too).  A remarkable story about a remarkable man.
0316228532|4.0|but then again, that's the point. Harry Potter and The Casual Vacancy really need to stop being compared; they are different in almost every possible way. The Casual Vacancy was by far not the BEST book I've ever read, but it was worth buying and reading. I wouldn't say I particularly enjoyed it, as the subject matter is tough, but I did find myself wanting to get back to it when I took a break from reading. The writing is strong, and the characters are developed well. Their personalities are clearly displayed and their inner struggles are gripping. While their actual lives may not be amazing and interesting, that also is part of the point of the story.
0316228532|5.0|I loved this book - yes it took a while to get going - with a huge cast of characters, each painstakingly introduced. However, the lengthy beginning certainly paid off as you become immersed in the daily, tortured struggles of people trying to find a sense of importance, 'authenticity' and meaning in the small community of Pagford.<br /><br />These characters - seemingly so small and petty, have been made magnificent by the lavish care given to their stories. The pettiness, prejudice and narrow mindedness rings true, even if you have not actually met 'these sort of people' - all of us suspect that parts of them live inside all of us.<br /><br />This wonderful novel is about as far from Harry Potter as you can get - but it doesn't seem as though JK Rowling set out to prove that she could write a profane, gritty urban satire/tragedy. No - this novel is so perfectly formed and well-written - I am left gasping in awe of her talent as a writer on many levels.<br /><br />If you are reading it for the 'Harry Potter' experience - you will be sadly disappointed. For me - it was akin to discovering a fresh new voice.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|this program has some nice features but even to just read the Bible, you had to be on-line or at least I did. it would not let me access it without being on the Internet. I ended up paying for another app with less features so I would be able to read scripture any where.<br />since I am frequently using my kindle where there is no wi ti ( like Dr office waiting rooms which there was a lot of appointments) I have never fully used or even attempted to use the features.
B0043JDUNS|3.0|The special effects are incredible. Robert Downey and Scarlett Johansson were great. It just wasn't as good as the first installment, though.
0525952926|5.0|I enjoyed every minute of this novel. It was an entertaining history lesson for me! I listened to the audiobook, and John Lee is a phenomenal narrator.
B0068THAGY|4.0|I thought it was well made. Wonderful characters, good plot. Makes a point about why aliens don't make contact with such a dangerous species like us.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Its nice to actually know how charged my battery is and how much time u can use apps also to see how long it will take to charge completely
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I loved this game!  My new best ever game. l had no problems loading or playing this game on my Fire.  The game was a nice length, and not to easy. Help hints when you need them. Not disappointment, you'll enjoy this game.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|A cute game to waste time with. needs a no purchase option so my kids can play it. having fun. I'll see how long I last until it's boring..
B005LAIHPE|3.0|Just a good action packed fun movie.  We will watch it again to catch what we missed, and just because it's fun.
0689865384|4.0|This is a unique take in a dystopian novel.  Most people wouldn't have an issue about being turned pretty.  Some things are worth staying ugly for...<br /><br />The characters were easy to relate to.  Shay is carefree and doesn't think about the ramifications of her actions.  She's indecisive, and fun.  David is sweet but can be a jerk, not that I blame him.  I would have acted like one too.  He acts like he carries the weight of the world on his shoulders.  Teenagers shouldn't be that stressed.  Tally was a refreshing main character.  It's nice to see female characters that aren't over-confident.  Some of her actions are also completely selfish.  I know those aren't great traits, but there's only so many times you can read about a character that's self-sacrificing from the very beginning.  It can get monotonous. So it's nice to see a character with weaknesses we all deal with on a mostly daily basis.<br /><br />The story line was slow paced.  I didn't mind this because Westerfeld did a great job with the world building.  I could picture the rusty ruins easily.  Most of the focus is on how Tally deals with the decisions she's made and her growth as a person.<br /><br />This wasn't the best dystopian I've read, but it kept my attention and I'll be reading the sequel, Pretties.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was long winded. No substantial ending. It was toted to be good but I guess I disagree.<br />I wasnt crazy about it.
B001G9LVGG|5.0|This is singularly THE BEST seasonal CD I have in my collection.  To be honest, I listen to it all year long.  \\"The Seven Rejoices of Mary\\" makes this CD worth twice the price and as this mistress of song always does, Loreena McKennitt creates renditions of many beloved holiday favorites as only she can do.  Beyond recommended ... Beloved!!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett reveals the effect WWI had on the lives of selected people from different countries and strata of society.The enormity and stupidity of the war is overwhelming. Follett tells of the desperation of British soldiers at the Battle of the Sommes as they are commanded to run into the barrage of German machine guns. etc. Love, espionage, revolution, the fight for women's rights, the haplessness of leaders: all of it is laid out in Follett's inimitable style. If you like historical fiction you will love this book.
B0053YGYO4|4.0|I've been a fan of Coldplay since I got their first 2 albums some years back at a Best Buy. This album was the scariest thing for me to even think of trying to listen to based on \\"Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall\\" alone. I have learned to love that song and its catchiness though.<br /><br />My favorite track is \\"Paradise\\" which is just too catchy and fun for it's own good. But other good songs are the aforementioned \\"ETIAW\\", \\"Charlie Brown\\", the underrated \\"Princess In China\\" which talks about relationship issues and features the ubiquitous Pop-n-B star, Rihanna, \\"Up In Flames\\" and the special \\"Up With The Birds\\".<br /><br />Previously, I said this album made my ears hurt. It did. However, I notice that listening again with different, more expensive headphones it is a lot easier on the ear drums. It was my cheap $10 earbuds that made the experience really, really unpleasant. So like I wanted, I'm awarding this a rating of...<br /><br />4 stars.
0307744434|5.0|This book is wonderful, very easy read and a very good story line.  I would recommend it to anyone between sixteen and ninety.
B005EHILV4|5.0|I wanted to be able to input both the sound from a shotgun mic as well as a record player I have sitting on my desk to my computer.  I needed something cheap and easy, and the reviews all around for this have been great.  I am able to quickly adjust the levels on both the mic and the record player with ease.  For my very specific use I love this little mixer.  The shotgun mic was giving me all sorts of level problems until I hooked it to this Behringer 302.  Would recommend this to other looking for a low cost solution to simple mixing.  This performs at levels similar to $100+ units.  Hope this helps, thanks for reading and have a great day.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Love the App. Always keeps me informed of the amount of time left for everything I would do on the Kindle. Easy set up. Thanks again...
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Thank you for writing the truth.  This administration does not know how to talk without SPIN The Navy seals are owed a blessed thank you for so many jobs well done.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I am an avid Ken Follett fan. His sagas are wonderfully crafted and historically accurate. The Century Trilogy grabs your attention and never lets go. I eagerly await the final volume!
B00772M1F6|5.0|I have read the reviews by others, and agree in a small part that JD has the 1950's vibe.  His music has so much more than that! He sings from the soul!<br /><br />The lyrics of his songs are unique!  And the great background intstrumentals enhance his singing style.  I look forward to seeing him perform live.
B009AJDDQU|4.0|This movie helped explain the alien sitting in the chair killed by the other alien.  It shows dead alien was wearing some type of suit.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I have never read the book, but I was pleasantly surprised by just how awesome this movie is!  Give it a chance and you will like it too. It was really unique in its story and adventure. I am so glad that I bought this movie on DVD so I can watch it again and again. It is a fast-paced action oriented movie and when you watch it the second time you will like it even more than the first time. My Dad and I saw it at the theater in 3D and we loved it! This DVD is definitely one that has repeated watch value, not one of those you see once and never pick up again. The author, Edgar Rice Burroughs,  of the \\"A princess of Mars\\" series, upon which this movie was based, truly was a revolutionary futuristic sort of guy to even be able to come up with a story like this in the year 1917. He wrote about planes that could fly from solar energy! I don't think they even knew that much about solar energy, except that the sun made plants grow in the early 1900's. When you realize the extent the actors and many extras went through to make this movie it's no surprise how expensive it became. For instance, Willem Dafoe plays the leader of his tribe called the Tharks. The actors that played the Tharks had to walk on stilts with heavy costumes and makeup in the desert, one hundred and twenty degrees of misery!<br /><br />I loaned it to my neighbor and he and his family loved it too. When I told him about it his first remark was \\" wasn't that the movie that the critics hated?\\" I feel like marketing truly dropped the ball with this one. They were calling it a flop while it was still at the theater, before it even had a chance for other people that might have been interested in seeing it, to gain interest. Who would want to see a flop? Russia, China and Mexico were big supporters, but I bet it had better support from their critics! The ads were too elusive to explain the story enough for people to even become interested in the story unless they had read the books in the past. I read about it a little before I was even that interested in going. I had to convince my Dad to go. We are glad we went and I'm especially glad to have this DVD. I just wish it had more in the series for me to buy later!<br /><br />This is the best movie that I've ever seen to disproportionately get so little appreciation from the industry! This should be a leading example in an advertising class of what not to do when promoting a movie with a largely unknown story line. I want to personally say \\"thank you\\" to everyone involved in the making of this movie, because I don't feel like you got the recognition you deserve and I really enjoyed all of your hard work!a little before I was even that interested in going.

B00571F26Y|5.0|My Uncle recommended this book to me and after reading excerpts on Amazon I ordered the Kindle edition for myself. I found the book very informative and easy to follow. It's been two weeks now since I eliminated wheat in my diet and I can honestly say that the claims in the book (for me so far) seem to be true. I don't have an allergy to wheat, but I always noticed that on those days when I ate more wheat-based carbs I was left hungry and craving more. Since eliminating wheat and reducing the other sources of \\"empty\\" carbs I have not had issues with cravings and the weight has been coming off again after a prolonged period on a plateau.<br /><br />For me, the author goes a little overboard toward the end of the book with some of his recommendations, but this does not detract from the overall message that wheat based carbohydrates can be quite detrimental and should be avoided.
B005AFB69E|5.0|It goes without saying that this movie is worth 5 stars (or More).  The blu-ray quality was awesome, and the wait was not bad at all.  I am always a bit hesitant to order internationally but the previous customer reviews were all favorable to this seller.  I would like to add my recommendation to theirs.  Thank you.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|Tried multiple times. It would not down load to my kindle. Hard to rate something you can't use.<br />Gave up trying .........
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Works nice and smooth, regardles of the platform.<br />I am using Evernote on the daily basis because of business and it solved my problems with the notes and checklists.<br />In addition, things like integration towards other apps in the family and voice notes are really nice addition.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Goes above and beyond. It's just like word but on my kindle fire. Quality is great. Totally recommend it for all.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Trés content de mon achat,super collector recut trés vite en france.Je le conseille a tous fan de la série pour un prix inferieur .
B005LAIHPE|1.0|I ordered this movie on DVD and got to watch it for free on Amazon video.  This has to be the dumbest movie ever put on film.  Nothing about Battleship is the least bit intelligent.  BE warned,,,,,you not only must suspend belief but be totally brain dead as well....Watch it but save your cash and don't purchase.  Some one in my family will be getting a dud for Christmas....Tom
B003B02O3C|5.0|The is another great book by a great author.  The detail in the character development is, as usual, great by this author.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|I am a huge fan of Lee Childs and his hero 'Jack Reacher'. Have read all his books and could not wait for 'A Wanted Man' to be released.<br /><br />I expected action in the opening chapters.<br /><br />I was however very disapointed in the read.<br />There was virtually no action by the hero until 75% through the book.<br />There were expectations of action that never eventuated.<br />The plot drifted into the grey area of terrorism which is not the usual story line.<br /><br />And the eventual discovery of the reason for all the happenings (abandoned nuclear waste dump)was a real let down.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|the movie was very entertaining and gave a new outlook on the fairy tale. My older grandchildren enjoyed the movie, but it was a little bit scary and graphic for my younger grandchildren and I would not let them watch the movie. they are 3, 4 and 6 years old. I appreciate that this movie could be returned if not satisfactory and that this is offered only through Amazon. I now purchase all my movies from Amazon and love the prices and quarantees.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not put these books down. Can't wait for the movie. Hope this author writes another series. Don't know how you would top this one though.
B004MPESSY|4.0|I rented this online. The video quality was quite good . As for the movie I enjoyed it. The rape scene was a bit graphic, but the she more than got her revenge.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Did not read the first book and maybe the movie of the first was better than the book, which meant for the second book I had great expectations.  All that can be said is that it was worth the read, just.  Moved quick enough and plot line wasn't too bad but a few inconsistencies let it down along with what felt like a rushed ending. Much better than what I could produce but felt it lacked something.  Don't think I was the target market.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|Its not nearly as useful as the website, but it will get you by on a mobile platform. Its difficult to view the different tabs for the daily deals.
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|The game is okay. It's fun but a little to challenging. It should have more hints. Other then that it's okay but not THAT great or addicting. Like I said okay. If you like very hard mysteries I recommend this.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It`s one of those books that you think I can`t believe I`m reading this but you can`t stop reading it.And when you are done you wish there was one more book to go.It had all the elements shock,anger,emotional roller coaster even afraid to turn the page but you can`t help yourself and you keep reading and reading.
B0094OLFUW|4.0|SEVERAL GOOD SONGS ON THE ALBUM. SOME ARE SURE TO BE HITS. Others are fine but I enjoy the womans voice the most.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|very nice adrenalin producing escape movie, it tried to show how the Star Trek crew origionaly united and achieved their first joint victory and I think it did quite well at this
B008XG1X18|1.0|I have it on my phone and love it but using it on my Kindle? Not at all..force closes or freezes .Unfortunately I will have to uninstall and continue to use on my phone
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It is nice to have a precise measurement of the batteries in my Kindle and they seem to be lasting a lot longer between charges.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love the app and so easy to use...impossible not to like it plus its so nice to carry the Bible with you everywhere you go.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I awaited eagerly the release of this book and it has not disappointed.  It pulls you in and propels you through the war years. The progression of the characters gives you a feeling of connection with the book.  Some of the scenes test the limits of plausibility.<br />The balance between wide level events and individual experiences  is very engrossing.  The downside to this book is it increases the anticipation of book 3.
1451673442|4.0|I found this book very informative and positive. Already good things have started to happen. This is a must read.
0307888908|4.0|Hoff man  as a founder of LinkedIn has much to say about personal career growth.  Notr surprisingly the book contains numerous useful examples of how to use Linkedin to grow your career.  The authors place more follow-up information on [...].  Clearly written, the book provides very useful career advice,regardless of what stage in your life you are.  It is not a self help book, since Hoffman stresses your growth depends on your network. Great for a cross country plan ride.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote has been very usefull across a number of devices (laptops, phones and tablets).  It has really made it easy to manage travel details while on the road.
B008M34CSI|4.0|but I REALLY liked this movie. Was it deep and thoughtful? No. What is full of useful information and a movie to lift your view of the universe? No. Was it intelligent? No. Was it simple, happy, entertaining fun? YES!<br /><br />Please do read other reviews I've written if you think I am some lightweight idiot who has low expectations of my entertainment preferences (no offense to WWE:Smackdown). But every once in a while, a movie just makes me laugh, without sexual references, bad language, and snarky political jokes. Every once in a while, a simple movie that was probably made to BE a simple movie comes along and is just good, clean fun. And Lockout was such a movie. If you read all the reviews here, even if you are a movie snob, please do suspend your expectations, go grab a bowl of popcorn and an ice-cold coke (or beer) and be prepared to be entertained with a simple story which is surprisingly strong in the sci fi genre, NOT the cruel stupidity the recent Syfy network has been throwing at us, which if some people are calling this a grade B movie, would make them grade X by comparison.<br /><br />I'm not even a big Guy Pierce, Maggie Grace fan. I watched this movie as soon as it hit the Amazon.com streaming line up because I was jonesing for any sci fi story, if only to get the taste of the recent offerings by Syfy out of my mouth. And perhaps THEREIN lies why I really liked this movie. I had no expectations at all.<br /><br />Guy Pierce plays a prisoner on his way to 30 years in \\"cryogenic sleep\\" for a crime he didn't commit. As he is being tranported to the prison station in space, the President's daughter, a do-gooder is at the prison making sure the prisoners are being treated with \\"respect.\\" Surprisingly (:-0), the daughter, played quite perfectly by Maggie Grace, is taken hostage by inmates who have revolted and taken over the prison. Snow (Pierce) reluctantly ends up having to defend and *SPOILER ALERT* (who cares?) ultimately defeat the prison revolt and return Emilie (Grace) to her father (the President). It is funny, the CGI is awesome, Maggie Grace is, as I repeat myself, quite awesome, Guy Pierce saves the day as the reluctant hero....wait, you've seen this before? Probably. But you know what? You haven't seen this version. And it sure beats anything I've seen lately, i.e. the sci fi genre. Check it out. And DO check your correctly snobby expectations at the door. You'll enjoy it for what it is and might end up with a good laugh and walk away a little happier for going to the playground and swinging on the swings!return Emilie (Grace) to her father (the President).

B006VA3ZEG|5.0|Downnton Abbey episode 1 and 2 are well worth watching and owning.  My husband and I bought the series and couldn't wait to watch them.  We have stayed up late at night so we could see the next show.  Love it!! can't wait for season 3!!
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|I have just finished watching Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close and am still weeping, so touched am I by this amazing little movie with such a huge story to tell. I suppose having lost a Dad almost as wonderful as Oskar had could be why it touched me so deeply, even though we lost them in very different ways.<br /><br />*****SPOILER ALERT***** for the rest of the review****<br /><br />This movie is about a little boy named Oskar Schell (played with just the right emotion and finesse by Thomas Horn) who has a father and a mother and lives in Manhattan. Oskar is very intelligent and his father (a splendid performance by Tom Hanks) spends a lot of time helping him overcome his many anxieties and expanding his world. Including the fact that there used to be SIX boroughs, instead of five now, which made up New York City. And therein lies much of the wonder of this story.<br /><br />His father was a jeweler, but on September 11, 2001, he had a meeting on a very high floor in one of the Twin Towers. Oskar doesn't know any of this, of course, and when the airplanes hit the towers, he was let go from school to go home. Oskar's father tries five times to call him at home to say goodbye, leaving uplifting, loving messages. Unfortunately, Oscar doesn't make it home until the sixth message comes in. When he hears the phone ringing, Oskar freezes and cannot answer. He listens as his father leaves a sixth labored message where, in the background he can hear glass breaking and people screaming. And this is pretty much the center of this movie.<br /><br />How does a little boy come back from such a moment, losing such a loving father, he could not even pick up the phone and listen to his last message from as he was dying? At first, the movie is a bit disjointed and confusing since we don't learn these things until it is tied up at the end of the movie.<br /><br />Oskar is a curious little boy and one night he meets a neighbor across the courtyard in his grandmother's apartment (we aren't told where his grandmother has gone). But Oskar is on a mission. One day shortly after his father was killed, Oskar finally decides to go into his closet. Inside, his curiosity gets him in trouble as usual, a blue vase lying on the top shelf comes tumbling down on his head, breaks into many pieces. Inside Oskar finds a key in a small manilla envelope with the word Black written on it. Because of the lessons taught to him by his father, Oskar begins his search for whom the key belongs and what he will find inside the lock box the key will fit. Inside of his grandmother's apartment he meets an old man played with the excellence only Max Von Sydow can. The old man joins Oskar's search. He has gotten all of the phone books for all of the boroughs of NYC, circles all the people named Black, and intends to visit each one every weekend, until he finds the one the key belongs to. I think this section is perhaps the most brilliant section of the movie. We, in the audience, already pretty much know that this man is his missing grandfather, Oskar's father's father. And the relationship formed by the two is magical. Von Sydow plays the old man as mute, so he has to write everything down. On one hand he writes yes, and on the other, no. This way, it's a simple way to answer yes or no questions. I was enthralled, watching the ever amazing Von Sydow, a genius of an actor and perhaps one of the best of his profession we've ever been graced with. His relationship with Oskar is always tenuous, we feel his discomfort many times as he tries to help his grandson through his terrifying grief, through this search for the key's box and what he will find inside that might hold the answers as to why Oskar lost his father so outrageously rudely. One day, Oskar decides to play all the messages for him, but Von Sydow cannot handle hearing his son's voice as it gets ever more fearful and difficult to breathe due to toxic fumes. And he leaves.<br /><br />Oskar is devastated. But of course, in the end, he manages to find the owner of the key, and learns that the key fits a lock box for someone else who lost someone on that terrible day. But that's not what this story is really about. It is really about a little boy's journey toward healing and, as we learn near the end, his seemingly absent mother, played by the always spectacular Sandra Bullock, who, unbeknownst to Oskar, has mapped out his course and visits each Black before Oskar gets there to let them know he will be coming and why. Here is where we get many of the answers that plagued us because, first of all, why would a mother be missing in action the way she seemed to be, and often, the people visited seemed as if they were waiting for him. As Oskar and his mother make this journey, we learn that both find healing in the process. In the end, Oskar writes a letter to each person he has visited and tells them he found the person the key belonged to and thanked them for their help.<br /><br />This is not a new story. We have certainly seen versions of it before, maybe not for the 9/11 incident, but for many others who are searching for meaning of losing a lost one. What separates this movie from others, is probably the excellent cast, with excellent directing, and a story, while as old as time, never seems to get old. Learning to forgive oneself for things left undone for a loved lost one can be one of the hardest things we, as imperfect human beings need to learn. That this happened on 9/11 wasn't the center of the story. The story teaches us that each journey toward letting go of our anger and hurt toward our lost loved one, is different. But never the less, needs to happen. In the end, Oskar writes to his grandfather and asks him to come \\"home\\" (he does), and he overcomes his fear of swinging on a set of swings in a NYC park. During his high swing, he notices something at the bottom of the swing. His father, which we saw at the beginning of the movie trying to get him on these swings, left him the note stuffed into the bottom of the swing. In it he tells Oskar that he has finished his journey - in so doing, he has discovered that the missing sixth borough is simply all the people who have finished THEIR journey thus learning what life is all about - overcoming our fear and moving on to live life with all the joy they possibly can.<br /><br />I'm afraid I can't add anything to that. It's just about right. And in a little way, with Oskar, I joined him in understanding where the people in the sixth borough went. A truly beautiful little movie with a HUGE role for Thomas Horn. Bravo, young man. And to the rest of the cast and crew of this amazing movie, two thumbs up. It was entertaining, and for anybody who has lost a deeply loved one, it is touching and another little secret in how to let go, but never forget. It is not preachy and I never felt a moment's discomfort for my own loss. I did, however, feel the joy of Oskar's discovery at the end. As the survivor of losing such a loved one, this can be a tricky task for a movie. It might be difficult for some people to watch, especially the recordings on the answering machines, but I would encourage any of you who have not seen it, whether you have lost a loved one or not, SEE THIS MOVIE. Some (most) movies make you wish you could get those two hours invested in that loser back. This one is like Goldie Locks says, just right! THIS is why I watch movies. As I have said before (and will again here on Amazon), you have to kiss a lot of frogs to find the prince (or princess).

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|very entertaining.  very User friendly.  I like the fact that you can still earn coins when you're not playing. very kid friendly.  entertains my 2 yr nephew.  I give this game 5 stars easily.
B000YMFCS4|5.0|Every once in a while, a movie comes along that should be schmaltzy and beneath you, but ends up being a totally, surprisingly, guilty pleasure (I WILL review Titanic one of these days, when I get up the nerve). The Notebook is my very wonderful, totally guilty pleasure. I will also make a case for it being possibly the movie of a generation and possibly a movie headed to becoming a classic in film.<br /><br />To go over the story once again at this point, would be boringly redundant. I'm doing this review many years after its release. But as I was going through my recommendations for ratings, I stopped here and decided it was time to give this beautiful movie its due.<br /><br />First of all, I am not a fan of Nicholas Sparks' books. No offense intended here because opinions are all relative and I know he has a huge fan following. I have read several of his books and have found them to be just a bit too simple and in need of a grammar lesson for me. The movies made from many of his books are worse and maybe eventually I will review one of them. But it is so much more fun, for me, to give the good reviews. I never read the book this movie is based on, so this review is strictly on the movie as it stands.<br /><br />The Notebook, as a story, is brilliant. From the moment it starts with Duke, played with a heartbreaking sensitivity I'm not sure I've ever seen from the wonderful James Garner, wandering around in his nursing home, smiling at his friends and joking with the staff. It's a little confusing because we aren't let in on the depth of his suffering and the center of the story yet. *SPOILER ALERT* There will be spoiler alerts from here on out, but if you haven't seen or read this yet, get out from under your rock AND DO SO! I think the beauty of this movie starts at the beginning because we love Duke immediately. There is no building of a relationship. It just is. We also learn pretty much right out the door that his beloved wife also lives in the nursing home with him, but in another room because she is in the end stages of Alzheimer's Disease, the 5th largest killer of the world's population. That this movie shows explicitly the horror and agony of Alzheimer's for both the caretaker/lifetime partner, and the family surrounding them is an incredible bit of public service very necessary and appreciated by those touched by this evil disease. However, the beauty of this story is that at the center of it, is a love story so powerful, so touching, and, as we learn, so surprising, that the disease, while an evil villain, is only a facet of the story.<br /><br />For me, the movie starts when the story becomes about Noah Calhoun, played by Ryan Gosling in, to me, one of his best acting parts (and I've seen too many of his movies), who meets the young and beautiful Allie, played by Rachel McAdams in, to me, one of HER best acting parts. Their romance is wonderful, fun, funny, lighthearted, everything most women dream about who want love, have loved, or have love in their lives. The love story isn't atypical of most love stories written and acted for centuries. But this one is touching in its portrayal of the depth and breadth of its intensity. Most love stories today, include a plethora of sex scenes to punctuate the depth of feeling. This story doesn't need it. It is implied as well as portrayed, but manages to show decades of love as a reality and not a fantasy. We do learn, of course, that this is the life love story of Duke and his beloved Allie, but not right away. And I think that lag is a brilliant part of the story woven here that attracted me and so many people.<br /><br />The Notebook is as beautiful in story as a breathtaking painting is to those who gaze upon it. Each stroke is carefully placed, each color chosen to accentuate what are the most important aspects the artist wants portrayed. From the moment The Notebook opens to the closing scene, I cannot find one stroke out of place. One color that doesn't blend in perfectly with the scenery on the canvas.<br /><br />I am a person who does not like sad endings to any story. But in The Notebook, once again, the portrait of the relationship between Duke and his Allie is perfect. No other ending would do. Yes, it is sad. But as a painting can also be excruciating in it's honesty and painfulness, so, too, is the ending of this movie.<br /><br />The Notebook is simply not just a love story. Love stories abound in the world of fiction told in many shapes and forms. I have to make a little observation here that today, we see the proliferation of what is called erotic romance. Fantasy romance. Supernatural romance. And while I am not normally a fan of romance books, preferring thrillers and a good mystery, there are few stories today that can compare with The Notebook. I believe it will enter the realm of a classic romance along with the Bronte sisters who wrote so few books, but each one was like a portrait described above. These stories are rare and beautiful and are meant to expand our hearts and souls. They are meant not to titillate to read and be forgotten within minutes, but to savor for a lifetime. I haven't seen The Notebook in at least 7 years and yet, what I have written has been from memory. A book, a movie, a portrait that stays with you, that you will remember for a lifetime. I would encourage all of you to watch this movie, even the men here, if you have not already done so. It wouldn't hurt to watch or read Jane Eyre or Wuthering Heights as well. For those who might not understand why these stories resonate - all of them - even today, it wouldn't hurt you to do some research. While contemporary romance is exciting and sexual, I doubt they will hold up for centuries. I believe The Notebook, as movie or book, will be around far longer and will stand up with Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights as a beautiful portrait does, for many, many years. DO please watch this movie and keep your mind and especially your heart open because beauty, while being in the eye of the beholder, can move even the hardest of hearts.fectly with the scenery on the canvas.<br /><br />I am a person who does not like sad endings to any story.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|The book was great..  Story line was great and kept you wanting more. I am very pleased with my purchases of all 3 books.
B003Y5H5EW|4.0|Kate Beckinsale made this movie work.  In my opinion, this is the weakest movie in the Underworld franchise.  The plot was not as exciting, in my opinion, as the previous movies in the series.  The good thing is that Kate Beckinsale has got the role of action star down pat.  She is probably one of the best female action star in the business today, right along with Angelina Jolie and Noomi Rapace.<br /><br />The movie time frame takes place a few years after the events of Underworld 2.  You may recall that Underworld 3 dealt with the backstory and told the story of Lucian and Sonia.  Basically, in chronological order in terms of the story, this is the order:  U3, U1, U2, and then this one.  Here we find our hero, the female vampire Selene, awakened from a deep sleep.  Not a natural vampire sleep, mind you, but a state of suspended animation within a laboratory.  Humans have learned of the existence of vampires, and have won the war.  Selene learns that she has a child with Michael, taken out of her while she was in suspension.  Escaping from the lab with her daughter in tow, they set out to look for the remaining vampires.<br /><br />Beckinsale did not start out as an action type of actress.  But with her experience in Underworld, Whiteout, and the recently made Total Recall, she has become one of the few female action stars in Hollywood.  Underworld is a pretty good franchise.  And this installment is no exception.  It is certainly worth your time to watch.  Stephen Rea, Sandrine Holt, Charles Dance, and India Eisley play supporting roles.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the book!  I couldn't put it down. My husband loved it too (even though he didn't read it! Lol!).<br />I'm not an avid reader so I really didn't care about all the bad writing reviews it received from some people. I thought it was easy to read.<br />My husband & I have been married 12 years & have been together for 22. We've always had a wonderful relationship but all of these books really helped spice things up!
B00887490Y|3.0|Jessica Biel proves she can act.  That's the good news.  The bad news is that this is a mediocre movie.  However, it is still worth your while to rent.<br /><br />The story takes place in a former mining town.  The mines had shut down years ago.  Now, with no source of employment and income, the town is in the grip of poverty.  Poverty destroys people.  It is the killer of hope.  Jessica Biel plays Mrs. Denning, a nurse.  She tries her best to provide medical care to the community.  She was married to a much-older man, the town doctor, until he passed away some years back.  For quite some time now, children have been disappearing.  No one knows where they end up.  Law enforcement is baffled.  One day, Mrs. Denning returns home from work, just in time to see a mysterious figure in a rain coat abducting her son.<br /><br />Anyway, I do not want to spoil the plot for you.  Jessica Biel and William B. Davis (Mulder's adversary from the X-Files) head the cast.  The scenes of poverty in the movie can put you into depression.  But if you are in a certain mood, this might be something that might interest you.  Especially if you like surprise endings.  The theme is also thought-provoking and might make you question the wisdom of allowing poor people to have children.

B008CLI4N4|5.0|You win, or you die.  That also applies to risky new shows.  HBO took a big gamble with this show.  And it looks like they've won.<br /><br />This is the HBO adaption of George R. R. Martin's best-selling epic, A Song of Ice and Fire.  A Game of Thrones is the first book in the series, and they have named the show accordingly.  So far, five books out of the planned seven volumes have been published.  The first show season covered the events in the first book.<br /><br />Sean Bean heads the stellar cast.  He plays the role of Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell.  He receives an offer from King Robert to take up the position of Hand of the King.  A position recently made vacant by the death of their former mentor, Lord Jon Arryn.  The King's Hand administers the country on behalf of the reigning monarch.  Eddard, known as Ned, takes half of his family down south to the capital, King's Landing.  Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, a marriage deal has been brokered between Princess Daenerys and Khal Drogo.  Daenerys and her older brother Viserys are the last of the Targaryens.  The Targaryens are an ancient noble family.  They have ruled Westeros for three hundred years until Robert Baratheon led a successful rebellion.  And now, the ambitious Prince Viserys wants to take back his throne, with the help of the Dothraki horselord, Khal Drogo.  In the far north, Ned's bastard son, Jon Snow takes his vows and joins the ancient brotherhood of the Nightwatch.<br /><br />This is a breakout performance for British actress Emilia Clarke.  She plays the role of the most important character in the entire epic saga, Princess Daenerys Targaryen.  Peter Dinklage plays the role of the Imp, Tyrion Lannister.  Lena Headey plays the role of the evil queen, Cersei Lannister.  Newcomer Kit Harrington plays the role of the bastard, Jon Snow.  And Michelle Fairley rounds out the stellar cast of first-tier characters by playing the part of Catelyn Tully-Stark, Ned's wife.<br /><br />Production values are of high quality.  The locations, mostly Northern Ireland, are nothing short of awesome.  And the special effects, especially in the season finale, are spectacular.  This, in my opinion, is the best show on HBO.  If you have missed the first season, or if you do not subscribe to HBO, then this DVD set is just the ticket.ues are of high quality.

B005XN3150|5.0|Wow! This show is like a breath of fresh air. This is just the kind of show that television networks really needed. It's a serious antidote to all the sitcoms, crime dramas, and reality shows that seem to fill network television air times.<br /><br />This is fantasy story-telling, for modern times. While the language used in the \\"fantasy world\\" scenes seem too modern for the usual fantasy genre, it fits perfectly here. Again, this is a fairy tale for modern times. This ain't a stage production of Shakespeare. What it is, is a story being told to viewers of all ages and not some high-minded theatre. And it does not pretend to be. The production quality is very high, and the special effects from the Season 1 Finale are just as good as what you would find anywhere in television. And that includes HBO. I would go out on a limb and say that the production and special effects on this show rival, if not exceed, those from the highly-regarded Game of Thrones.<br /><br />Lana Parrilla (Regina/Evil Queen) is probably one of the more interesting villains on television today. Her character is well-developed, capable of both good and evil. Admittedly, she usually chooses the latter approach in most of her dealings. Her motivations for her hatred of Snow White (Mary Margaret in modern times) is something that the audience can relate to. Well, some of the audience. This is a story that crosses both time and space. The games being played between Regina, Rumplestiltskin/Mr. Gold, and Snow White take place simultaneously across time. Love and hatred, revenge and vengeance, know no bounds it would seem.<br /><br />And what a terrific job Jared Gilmore had done, playing Henry. I cannot remember a scene in which he has acted badly. Here we are, 23 episodes done and he just continues to shine. The rest of the cast are no less spectacular. This is a show full of good acting.  And more importantly, this is a show with some of the best writers around.  Terrific writing , casting, and directing.<br /><br />So what is the show about? What can I write that would not spoil the plot for you? Ok, here are the basics. Young Snow White makes a big mistake, which resulted in a very painful loss for Regina. Regina turns to dark magic and vows revenge on Snow White. Meanwhile, a humble Rumplestiltskin (played by Robert Carlisle) decides to take the power of the Dark One for himself in order to no longer be the coward that he is known for. Snow White grows into a young woman, all the while running and hiding from Regina, who has become Queen. Meanwhile, she meets up with James, known as Prince Charming. Every move that Regina makes to take her revenge on Snow White has failed. Somehow, Snow and her friends always managed to dodge and foil Regina's attacks. But, not to be outdone (hate is a powerful motivator after all), Regina makes one very bold move. One that would affect the entire realm. She puts together a curse that transported everyone in the realm, into a world without magic. Yes, our world. And without their memories intact! That is the curse, to live in a miserable world, never remembering who they once were. But all curses can be broken. A master carpenter named Gepetto creates a box, from the wood of an enchanted tree. And in that box, the daughter of Prince Charming and Snow White was placed, in order to protect her from the curse. She gets sent to the future along with the others, but because of the protection afforded by the magic chest, she has abilities that protect her from Regina, who is now the town mayor. The daughter, Emma (played by Jennifer Morrison), ends up in Boston. Young Emma grows up bouncing from one foster home to another. She gets pregnant at 17 and makes a decision to give up her baby (Henry), to give him the best chance in life.  Young Pinocchio, smuggled into the enchanted box by Gepetto, was given the task to take care of Emma.  But, ofcourse, loses himself in this new world and forgets his duty.<br /><br />Just like the verybest and most engrossing of all stories, this one is equally driven by plot and by character. Perhaps one of the more touching character plots here is that of Pinocchio. Great acting from Eion Bailey, Ralph Sbarge (Jiminy Cricket), and Tony Amendola (Gepetto).  Robert Caslisle is just having too much fun playing the dual roles of Mr. Gold and Rumplestiltskin.  And Lee Arenberg plays the dual roles of Grumpy the dwarf, and LeRoy the custodian.  Ginnifer Godwin, Jennifer Morrison, Josh Davis, Emilie DeRahvin, Sebastian Stan, and Beverley Elliott round out the stellar cast.<br /><br />In my view, this is the best show on network television right now. Perhaps equal to Game of Thrones. The latter ofcourse is for mature audiences only. Once Upon A Time is a show that everyone can enjoy. There's something there for everyone. With so many characters, and so many plot lines, you are sure to find one that will keep you tuned in week after week. And, if you missed Season 1 and are slow to catch on, you've got many choices as far as streaming or downloading, renting or buying.  You can buy or rent here at Amazon.  If you have a PS3 or an XB360, you can also purchase via their networks.best and most engrossing of all stories, this one is equally driven by plot and by character.

B007H1HQW0|3.0|I had little trouble putting the device together per the instructions, but I have had no success at all (yet) cutting glass.  I followed the instructions regarding the hot/cold method, and I am sure that I have been getting good scribe marks, but so far nothing has worked.  I am not giving up yet, and to be fair, I have only tried a couple of times spread out over a few weekends, but I am dissapointed to date.  Thought it would be simpler
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I haven't finished reading this book, but am enjoying every minute of it. Folletts descriptions and characters are so well done one forgets they are reading a novel.

B007SGM084|5.0|Excellent read and hard to put down.  I only purchased this book because everyone was talking about it, but now I see what all the hoopla was about.  Absolutely delicous!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|The book was, as always, an easy read and thoroughly enjoyable. I am still bummed out that they chose Tom Cruise to play the role. I suppose that, if you never read any of the books, it would be OK. Having read them, I think it's a joke. I don't know where they are going to get enough actors that are under 5 foot tall to make him a believeable character.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The more I got into the book, the more it grabbed me. I had to finish it, to find out what was going to happen next. I really became invested in the characters.

B009AJD5E0|1.0|You can read all the other negative reviews. Suffice it to say it's a pretty movie with extremely poor writing. Nearly every character does stuff totally unbelievable and out of character. I don't think I've seen a worse written movie. B-Movies made for laughs might have poor writing but rarely is it this poor. I'm not going to list all the problems, you can Google them and they'll all come up.
B000002LGA|5.0|Seriously, \\"New York\\" remains one of Lou Reed's most vibrant CDs to date.  A pure sense for a conceptual album exists here that unwavers and just further reinstates Reed as one of the musical geniuses of this era.  His twangy version of Pennsylvania country and 50's rockabilly music flavors this accurate portrayal of the great American city with the patented Reed sound, that is all ready so familiar.  The CD works on so many levels to make it such a musically solid piece of work.  I mention \\"A Busload of Faith\\" as a particularly iconic song that makes the heart race with angry hope.  I don't usually go out of my way to toot the horn for a celebrity, especially one that is so pathetically egocentric, but this stuff is to be held with esteem.  In some cases, you really have to pay the devil his due.
B005LAII8A|2.0|I am not a sci-fi fan and went to see this moving because of the cast, but they did not win me over. It is a confusing plot/story line.  The only reason it didn't get a 1 start is because of the captivating performance of young Pierce Gagnon as Cid.
B008MU8ZNO|4.0|KILLER KLOWNS FROM OUTER SPACE BLU-RAY<br /><br />The Blu-ray release of Killer Klowns from Outer Space is drawing very mixed reviews with some thinking it was a solid transfer and others saying it was nothing more than an upconverted DVD. When it comes to Blu-ray and DVD transfers I don't claim to be an expert so you won't see a lot of the tech stuff. I have a lot of knowledge on film in general (horror and cult being my strong point), but again I don't claim to be an expert on Blu-ray and DVD technology so you'll just get my thoughts on how things looked.<br /><br />First off I wanna get into the package design, which personally I hated. Whenever FOX releases an MGM title they almost always change the cover art and the changes aren't for the better; at least with the Death Wish movies FOX released on BD they kept true to the original artwork (more so on 3 & 4), but all 3 retain a retro look in general. But the cover art for Killer Klowns looks like one of those really bad DTV movies. I suppose the original poster art and original DVD art might look too 80s so I get why FOX would make some changes, but this was horrible. Rant over; I just get annoyed when the original art is changed and even more so when it looks terrible.<br /><br />As for the video well look Killer Klowns is an excellent low budget movie that is a total blast, but truth is the movie isn't in high enough demand for FOX to roll out a 5-star treatment and full restoration of the original negative. Companies like Blue-Underground and Shout Factory, Synapse might be willing to go back to the original negatives for the most part, but those companies focus on cult cinema that's their specialty, whereas FOX has movies of more importance to them. However with that said something like that never excuses poor work done on a release.<br /><br />The Blu-ray transfer isn't gonna blow you away simple as that. But overall I found it a nice upgrade over the DVD, which was a little dark and murky looking and this BD release is brighter and more detailed than the old DVD. I'm actually surprised at the positive reviews for Anchor Bay's Halloween 4 & 5 and when people mention things they couldn't see on the DiviMax DVDs I'm like really? All this so called added detail I was able to see on the DVDs and quite honestly the differences between Blu-ray and DVD are minor and even more so when the DVDs are upconverted. We get the basic HD upgrade from SD, but if anything the Halloween 4 & 5 Blu-ray's are more upconverted than Killer Klowns from Outer Space.<br /><br />The transfer gets off to an ok start, but as the movie rolls on quality seems to improve. One thing I noticed from the very start though is the colors really pop. Besides the colors, detail as I mentioned is improved and I guess the best way to describe this BD release is if you've seen past MGM titles put out on BD by FOX you should know exactly what to expect from the transfer. Almost all of them are an upgrade over the DVDs with some being a major upgrade and some being a slight upgrade, but basically all the transfers look the same.<br /><br />Some complained about the grain level, but quite honestly I really didn't notice it much. For starters I expected a high level of grain like the FOX release of Death Wish 2 (not that a heavy grain layer is a bad thing) and also its been several years since I've seen this so I was focused more on the movie. Perhaps on another viewing I will take more notice of the grain, but in general I didn't find it nearly as grainy as some reviews have mentioned. In my opinion the grain level was just right.<br /><br />The one thing I will say though is while yes the movie does look good overall we shouldn't just accept anything since it allows companies to put in less work. If Blue-Underground, Shout Factory and Synapse can put together the release they do on a I'm sure much less budget than FOX there isn't any excuses for poor quality. But overall I was pleased with this release. As I stated some say it looks like an upconverted DVD and even actual blu-ray review sites a few have said that, but I would disagree. Again as much of a beloved cult movie this is Killer Klowns From Outer Space just simply isn't in high enough demand for FOX to put more effort into it, but what we do get I found pleasing and easily makes for an upgrade over the old DVD. The only thing the DVD has over it is a much better cover art.<br /><br />As for the audio like the transfer you won't be blown away, but audio is mostly solid and as I said before if you've seen other MGM titles FOX has put out on BD you should know what to expect from the transfer and the same can be said about the audio.<br /><br />The extras from the DVD have all been brought over and nothing new was added. Features are entertaining and I would like to go in more detail, but its been covered so many times not much I can add.<br /><br />Overall once again you won't be blown away by the audio or video, but it is a solid release overall and makes for an upgrade over the DVD. The transfer is nowhere near as poor as some make it and nowhere near as great as others. It's simply a passing transfer and it gets the job done.ed some say it looks like an upconverted DVD and even actual blu-ray review sites a few have said that, but I would disagree.

0375869026|5.0|August was born different. His face didn't form the same way as everyone else's. This left him with eyes to low, ears that aren't quite right, no lower jaw and other things. His brain works fine though and his emotions work too. People don't know how to react around him. Even after countless surgeries to make his face useable, he still doesn't look like everyone else. August is used to it though, the stares. He doesn't like it, but he doesn't have much of a choice, it hasn't been to terrible...yet. Now his parents think it's time for him to go to school. His mom has no more left to teach him, and he needs to learn how to deal with other people. At first August is hesitant, the life he has now is pretty okay why would he want to change that? August should know best of all though, that sometimes change can be good.<br /><br />August was mature for his age, but only about his appearance. In other ways he seemed like a typical ten-year-old boy. I can't really picture what August must look like, but I would definitely want to be his friend (except I'm not a big Star Wars fan). He has a great sense of humor and is in general a pretty cool kid. I enjoyed that we got to see different perspectives in this novel. It starts and ends with August, but in the middle we get to hear from his sister Via, her boyfriend, her old friend, and a couple of August's school mates. It was nice to get to hear their side of the story too, it made August's character even more developed and lovable. It was also nice just to see what was going on surrounding August, that he may ave not told us, or may have not even known about. I really liked the illustrations at the beginning of each new perspective too.<br /><br />This was a truly inspirational and touching story about a boy trying to grow up without too much ordeal. August realizes he looks different, but he doesn't feel different and he wants people to just adjust to him. I really liked the friendships he made, it's always nice reading about people who show genuine kindness. I also really enjoyed his teacher's precepts, and the ones that the kids sent in at the end of the novel. They completely matched with the kid who wrote them. I thought this was a good little lesson in itself to include within the novel.<br /><br />A great novel for anyone who has ever been stared at because they look a little different. Anyone who has had cooties, or in general was teased for something they had no control over, should read this book. Wonder is a great novel for kids to read and hopefully it will help them remember that all people have feelings. It's a great book for adults too, because as you will see in this novel it's not only children that can behave poorly.<br /><br />First Line:<br />\\"I know I'm not an ordinary ten-year-old kid.\\"<br /><br />Favorite Lines:<br />\\"My name is August, by the way.

B007B8EX9I|5.0|Fantastic show and great season. Would recommend it highly. Can't wait for the next season. If you haven't seen it-watch it from the beginning.<br />Give it 5 stars!!!
1423140605|3.0|This book should have been at least 800 pages or more. With seven cool characters it needed to be more in depth and it seemed like alot of the adventures were just getting done easily to get to the end. Following the awesome book of The Son of Neptune I had a feeling this was not going to quite live up to it. The first 2 books was like the snowball effect of going downhill. As you read through them the snowball comes out big and ready grow more with the next book. But after reading Mark of Athena the snowball comes out the same size it enters. Don't get me wrong, the book was decent, but maybe Riordan was pressured to come out with the book and had no choice but to write it that way. I just hope that the next book he takes his time and pushes the date back if he needs to just to have the awesome stories like the Percey Jackson series and the first 2 Heroes of Olympus books. I'm just crossing my fingers for the next one.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I really enjoy this game. I do think that it could be easier to get the cards or permits needed to buy certain items. There are things for sale such as the airport that cost to many permits. The game is great I just think those minor things could be better.
B005SNMR8W|5.0|Another outstanding episode with some fast paced action and some sweet Harley motorcycles. I still think that Gemma is the coolest but meanest woman in any television series I watch.
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|The battery life is shorter than an alkaline battery. But even so in my regular usage it endures for weeks.<br />The recharging is very simple as it doesn't require to open the bottom of the mouse. Just place the mouse on the recharging unit and you're done!<br />The recharging unit also looks great on the table.
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|This book was set as last month's title for our local book club (14 readers). All rated it highly and to my mind I have read none better at all. This after my initial reaction against the structure of using letters, which quickly changed to absorption in this compelling story. Charming and engaging on several levels.
B009AJDDQU|5.0|a take off from Alien movie. the far best movie sci-fci movie, next to Alien.<br />a must see to Reliey Scott fans.  a very well done movie, i have on digital also.
B008MEM24S|5.0|this is such a good game love the new level pack but still needs . but still a good game. 5/5
B0098VYCCE|4.0|The only thing I would change in this movie is the adult Snow White... But in general I think is worth to watch; there is a twist from the classic and it is entertaining. I wouldn't pay to watch it in the cinema, though.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Found the book an interesting read.  Once you get past the erotica, the storyline is great.  I just couldn't put the book down.  Thank God I don't have to account to anyone for the time I spend reading.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I really enjoyed that book, because the kids in the book have different kind of personalities that makes more interest,reach,active.you will really enjoy it is not boring at all, also the person who reads the book has good intonation while read it.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Me: \\"you don't NEED to make another Batman film! You have given us everything!\\"<br />Nolan: \\"Not everything, not yet.\\"<br /><br />The Dark Knight Rises borrows many elements from The Dark Knight Returns and Batman: Knightfall, but DO NOT think this is a straight forward adaptation of those storys. This just borrows some key plot elements, and becomes a stand alone movie. It's alot like what Nolan did with Batman Begins, as that one was heavily inspired by Batman: Year one, but became its own story.<br /><br />WARNING: I may SPOIL The SECOND installment, The DARK KNIGHT, in DETAIL.<br /><br />So at the end of The Dark Knight, Batman took the blame for Harvey Dents fall, now becoming enemy number 1 of the police. The Dark Knight Rises takes place 8 years after the Dark Knight, and as it turns out, Bruce Wayne gave up Batman and is now retired. Meanwhile, Gotham City is currently celebrating a time of peace. The Joker was captured at the end of The Dark Knight (and although his fate is uncertain in this film, all you need to know is that he's gone) and the police have cleaned up the rest of Gotham. Although peace has been achieved in Gotham, our heros have pretty much been eaten alive by this lie. Bruce Wayne hung up the Batman symbol, but never moved on. He is a recluse in Wayne Manor, not knowing what to really do with is life. As for Jim Gordan, lets just say he has been messed up the most mentally after Dark Knight. His wife has left him, and he has been speeking this lie for 8 years, PRAISING Dent going \\"oh, Harvey Dent, truth, justice, and the american way!\\" while thinking \\"yeah, Harvey Dent, the jerk that tried to kill my own son!\\". So in a way, Jim Gordan is on his own, having nothing but this lie he has to live with.<br /><br />Things change, however, when our terrorist Bane steps in Gotham. He has one purpose: take control of Gotham. He starts a series of attacks in Gotham, forcing Bruce Wayne to pick up the mantle of Batman again to reclaim his city. Of course, there is much more to Banes plan, as he wants to break Batman both mentally and physically. Why? Because Bane is associated with a previous villain in this series, and seeks revenge. This all leeds to a number of sub plots and character arcs (along with the introduction of several new characters) all leading up to an ending where everything is tied together.<br /><br />The POSITIVES:<br />-The writing is great (not as great as Begins and The Dark Knight, but still great).<br /><br />-The action and effects are sensational! 90 percent of the action of this film is done with practical effects and death defying stunt work. There isn't really an iconic \\"money shot\\" scene like the truck flip in the Dark Knight, but the action is still really good. Also, the fist fights between Batman and Bane aren't as good as they should be, but are still alright, and improved over Begins and Dark knight. But, the dialogue between Batman and Bane makes up for it.<br /><br />-The acting is incredible. The characters are written and portrayed well, and are all great. There are probably too many characters to take in one film, but, they are all still done well, and you don't want any of them to have been cut out of the film.<br /><br />-There are some great moralls too. Plenty of emotion, and some good character analysis.<br /><br />-The ending: there are no words to describe but EPIC. It's written great, filmed great, and acted great. Somehow, Chris Nolan wraped everything up PERFECTLY, and I am shocked he was able to do so. Trust me, he MEANT IT when he said this would be the final Batman film of this series.<br /><br />SURPRISES:<br />-One of the main charcters in this film was Anne Hathaway as Catwoman. Her role isn't EXTREMELY pivotal to the plot, but important to Bruce Waynes story, and she has plenty of screen time. I didn't think Hathaway would be a good Catwoman, at all, but I was wrong! She was cast PERFECTLY, and gave a great performance. Tom Hardy I already new would be a great Bane (and he was).<br /><br />-In The Dark Knight Rises, ALOT of new characters are introduced, but thankfully, almost every character gets enough screentime, and they all give great performances.<br /><br />-Another newcomer particularly is Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who gives a great performance as Officer John Blake. Although an original character by Nolan, he has several chatracteristics of a few charcters from the comics. He was acted and written so well, that I WANT to see this John Blake character in the comics.<br /><br />-And lets not forget the plot twists. There are moments of BRILLIANCE in this film. Obiously I won't spoil the plot twists for anyone though. Sure, I saw 1 or 2 of them coming, but there were a few I DID NOT expect.<br /><br />The NEGATIVES:<br />-one nitpick I have is how Batman immediatly retired after Dents cover up. Instead, I would have stated Bruce continued  to be Batman for 2 or 3 years (as a fugitive being hunted by the police) and slowly faded away, and by the point of this film, he has only been retired for a couple years. This is only a nitpick, since the starting off point of the film would stay the same, and this change wouldn't have made much difference to the plot. And it would still take place 8 years later, the only difference being he has just been retired for a couple years, instead of all 8.<br /><br />-Banes voice is an issue for alot of people. Trust me, you can understand him... 97 percent of them time. There are a few lines of dialogue that you can't quite understand, but overall, the voice was fine. BUT, in the opening, Banes voice was TERRIBLE! Yeah, I could understand him, but you couldn't help but laugh whenever he talked. After the opening act, however, they got the tone right, and Bane started to sound cool later, just bad in the opening.<br /><br />-editing was alright, but felt kind of \\"choppy\\" at times.<br /><br />-The pacing was good for the length, but still not that great.<br /><br />-alot of people think the film was too long. I disagree, I thought it was to SHORT!<br /><br />-The movie is 2 and a half hours long, but, this movie is the definition of a 3 hour movie. If it was just 15 minutes longer, almost all of my problems would be fixed.. The pacing would have been better, and the film just would have \\"flowed\\" better, instead of feeling clutered with information. And considering that some of our most successful films (Titanic, Lord of the Rings, and a few others) are well OVER 3 hours, I doubt extra length would have been a negative effect on this film in any way.<br /><br />-Despite the large amount of characters cramed into 2 and a half hours, most of the characters get enough screen time, except for one. Marion Cotillard as Wayne interprise member Miranda Tate. She gets a good amount of screentime, but still needed more. If the film was 10 to 15 minutes longer, 5 extra minutes JUST with her would have given her character more time. She was the one character that just didn't get enough development.<br /><br />-I have a few other nitpicks, but only a few are worth mentioning. There is a scene with a bank robbery in broad daylight, but 8 minutes later, it's pitch black! And when it comes to the plot midway through, it may seem a little illogical, but no more than Batman Begins or Dark Knight, so you can't question what is realistic and what isn't WITHOUT questioning the others. You can't ask one question without asking another.<br /><br />Overall, The Dark Knight Rises is, whether you like it or not, a good film, and an incredible ending to Chris Nolans trilogy. And alot of people complain about the ending, saying \\"MY Batman wouldn't do this!\\" well, it's not anyone elses Batman in this series, it's Chris Nolans Batman. We all have out own interpretation of the Batman character, and Chris Nolan gives us his. And personally, I don't think Chris Nolan could have ended his take any better. So, if you ignore the comics, forget your personal opinion on the Batman mythology, and view The Dark Knight Rises as a STAND ALONE MOVIE, you should be fine. The main reason why the ending works is BECAUSE it's forshadowed in the previous 2 films (if you payed attention, of course). \\"if you make yourself more than just a man, if you devote yourself to an ideal, you will become something else entirely. A legend.\\" As a man he can be destroyed, but as a symbol, he can live forever. THAT is a comman theme illustrated in this entire trilogy. If you can accept that, then you should know that The Dark Knight Rises has a very fitting end.<br /><br />If you liked Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, there is no good reason to NOT like this one. If you liked Begins (but didn't care for The Dark Knight) this should be a pleasant surprise, as this movie ties in ALOT to Begins, and I would even reccomend everyone to rewatch Begins before viewing Rises. But, if you DIDN'T care for Begins or Dark Knight, this film probably won't win you over, but everyone should still check this out. For me, this film gave me everything: Suspense, action, genius writing, great performances, 2 great cameos, plot twists, and an incredible ending, Nolan book ends everything as a trilogy should.<br /><br />Another word of warning: If you are looking for a nonstop \\"Batman\\" film, well, this may not be for you. This movie features less screentime for Bruce Wayne in the Batsuit than any other Batman movie. But that's the point. We got plenty of Batman in The Dark Knight, so now, we have Bruce Waynes story being completed.<br /><br />If you don't like Chris Nolans take on Batman, that's fine, but don't HATE on these movies just because they aren't for you. Sure, it is pretty illogical at times, but just as much as every other movie in existance. And if someone is going to tear this film apart over nitpicks or small plotholes, trust me, if I tried I could EASILY do that to any other movie. Just acknowledge that these ARE good films, instead of complaining about what you DON'T like.It's not that I ignore the problems in this movie, it's because there is MUCH more good than bad, so I can still give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Also, some people were dissapointed with The Dark Knight Rises because the expectations were SO overwhelmingly high. PLEASE, do NOT let your expectations get the best of you! Think logically (like me) before viewing this movie. Sure, this film isn't 10 times better than Dark Knight as that was to Begins, but, it's still great! I still love all 3 chapters of this trilogy (something alot of trilogys fail at).<br /><br />So, if you enjoyed Batman Begins and Dark Knight (and payed attention to the themes illustrated in them) you should enjoy this. Is this the PERFECT everything a fanboy could want Batman film? Well, no. But heck it'll do! It's still a great Batman movie, and succeeds in doing what was most important: giving the trilogy a fitting ending. Sure, the movie isn't perfect, but quite frankly, a perfect film just doesn't exist.<br /><br />And if there is anything else that anyone is confused or scratching their head about, please comment. After seeing this film 3 times, I have been able to explain nearly every plothole or problem I had when I watched it the first time. If you were confused in any way, feel free to ask questions :)<br /><br />Everyone should check this out, as it is a truly incredible ending to this amazing trilogy.<br /><br />Me: \\"I never said thank you.\\"<br />Nolan: \\"and you will never have to.\\"n film? Well, no. But heck it'll do! It's still a great Batman movie, and succeeds in doing what was most important: giving the trilogy a fitting ending. Sure, the movie isn't perfect (and I have NEVER seen a perfect film) but The Dark Knight Rises still delivers enough greatness for me to give it a 5 star rating. A truly inclredible end to this amazing trilogy.<br /><br />Me: \\"I never said thank you.\\"<br />Nolan: \\"and you will never have to.\\"
B00846REIS|4.0|Fifty shades of grey fan<br /><br />Recommend reading<br />For fifty shades of grey fans. look up sylvia day for additional reading
B002MQYOFW|5.0|That was one of the best books ive ever read. i couldnt put it down. im thrilled with the whole concept of the book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|You simply must buy the 1-5 set because after reading the first short novel you want more! The series really brings the wasteland future to life with likable characters. I look forward to reading the next book because I couldn't put this one down once I started. Excellent story!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have never found a website that has everything a woman could ever want to look up. So many great things/crafts/ ideas to learn. I love it!
0525953728|5.0|So happy this book was written.  So much untruth by the current administration and media.<br />This was told by someone who was there and the story needed to be told correctly.
B002KAJ0AO|1.0|Every band has their era where they make their mark, why must a band come back and reform; lack of income?  Come on BSB, I was a fan when i was 12ish (I'm 28 now), and was happy to see them split to be honest.  When you have left your print on the industry, it's usually best to just leave it be and just reminisce the good times and not try to reenact them and reunite.  Even metal bands (the music I'm now into) shouldn't do it, and it's nearly worse for them.  Please, BSB, do us all a favor and retire.  You've made your mark, now just leave it as it is.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I thought the book was a good read, but the ending was a HUGE disappointment. When I came to the end of the story I thought, \\"that's it\\". A real let-down for me.
B004LUHQ1G|1.0|I have given them chance after chance to get good but to me, it never seems to happen.  I think it's because I don't like how Dave plays music.  It's as if he is trying to mimic their crap in Nirvana and failing.  Dave owes Cobain his career though and is only popular because of his days with Nirvana.  The only stuff I ever liked was The Colour and The Shape.  Other than that, their music to me is worse than nails screeching down a chalkboard.  I seriously wish they would stop making music, it's deafening to those who like REAL music, not this synthetic alternative90's mimicing crap.
0316044938|1.0|I found the descriptions of the rape and murder in this book really gruesome and disturbing. I wish I had never read it because the imagery haunts me. The thought of someone else reading it bothered me so much that it is the first book I have ever thrown in the garbage.
B00006V9A0|2.0|This is just a pathetic (yet successful) attempt to bring in more revenue at the peek of popularity of Cobain's death.  Personally, I never liked Cobain because of his crappy heavy drug-induced music and lyrics, which is why I don't like Nirvana, there was no talent and no one knew what real talent was.  What I call real talent and influence are icons like Zeppelin, Cash, Floyd, Slayer, Sabbath and possibly Metallica.  I may not care for their music but I have immense respect for them.  They influence rock and metal like no one could or can.  Nirvana influenced ONLY grunge and alternative.  Everyone will hate me for saying it and probably are thinking of a billion ways to sadistically mutilate and torture me, but it's true.  This album was just a means to profit off Cobain's death.  Even though I despise Cobain, I thought this idea was largely disrespectful.  They may call it a tribute in his honor, but I very much highly doubt it.  It's a greatest hits that I wouldn't even bother touching.  you just can't profit off anyone's death and call it a tribute, it's just wrong no matter whose death it comes after.
B000SEI230|5.0|A Walk to Remember was an excellent read.  Very good book. When reading this book it was very hard for me to put it down until I finished it.
B000003TA4|3.0|Yes, I said it, I hate Nirvana.  However, Smells Like Teen Spirit is among my favorite songs of all time, as my redemption comment lol.  Before the fire and lava start pouring out of your ears, let me explain why I dislike them.  First I'm going to start off by fueling the fire and saying I think Kurt Cobain is among the worst songwriters in history because most, if not all, the songs were written while he was on drugs or drunk.  That to me does not make you a good writer.  It just means you can produce crappy noise for people who have no idea what music is.  He was a decent guitar player but even still sucked at it.  The SOLE reason for three stars was for the influence this CD had on pop-culture.  I would never ever own this, I'd get the few songs I like and call it good.  Nirvana was unquestionably one of the most influential bands in rock history according to our society, but to me that doesn't say much.  Black Sabbath, Cannibal Corpse, Johnny Cash, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Aerosmith, Slayer, and maybe Metallica were REAL rock and metal icons.  Nirvana brought grunge and alternative rock to the forefront but didn't really influence metal or heavy rock much.  They were just the Black Sabbath of the alternative scene, not rock in general.  I know everyone wants to stab my eyes repeatedly with a dull rusty butter knife right now, but hey, it's just how I feel.  Would I recommend this album?  Only to a collector, but not to rock or metal fans.
B000FC2L1E|4.0|I really enjoy reading sequels that offer entertainment, suspense, romance and drama. Outlander offers all of this.<br />Unfortunately the author is very repetitive in her descriptions of the same subject matter. I have skipped several pages due to this practice.<br />Also, although I do realize this is a novel - there are some things that the average, middle-aged (or any age for that matter) person could not live through, no matter how great their health or physical stamina is.<br />However, all of the above not withstanding, is not enough to deter me from reading the rest of the series!
B005JLN9ZI|1.0|After giving this album another chance, I am very shocked anyone would have the gull to sign this guy.  He has no flow, no substance and sure as can be does not have the vocals for hip hop.  Oh man, this was torture trying to get through just the first minute of each song.  I swear his manhood hasn't dropped yet, he has the most annoying voice beside Nicki Minaj.  Honestly, how Drake has any fans out there is beyond my comprehension.  I have read that some people say, \\"Drake is a genius in music.\\"  I say, \\"Yeah, if you love someone who can't rap or rhyme very well.  If you like someone who sounds like a 4 year old with a speech impediment.\\"  Drake is beyond terrible as can be, I'd give him negative 20 stars if I could.  He gives Minaj, Lil Wayne and Kanye West a very good competition for the worst rapper of all time.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This is my first Lee Child book. It was very gripping and hard to put down. Very action packed, and I like the Jack Reacher character. I will definitely read more in this series.
B0045JEPXU|1.0|I've heard a lot of his songs and I think he has one of the most annoying voices in all of hip hop besides Lil Wayne.  His beats are too stale and repetitive.  It's an ear sore to listen to this crap, Even my wife (who loves hip hop) doesn't like his music much.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|This app is very good. It has all the local stations in LA and I can still hear the stations from Europe. This is all I need!
B000FVBLEI|5.0|I knew about ATR right before this album came out, and have loved them since I heard this one.  I wasn't fond of This Darkened Heart, but this one is a HUGE step in the right direction and they became so much better with each album.  Phil is among the greatest metal vocalists of our time, and this album proves just that.  It is genuinely amazing what this band can do and accomplish.  They will be pioneers of Metalcore as long as they veer away from their new direction as heard on their new CD \\"A War You Cannot Win.\\"  As long as they don't veer too far from \\"The Fall of Ideals\\", they should be fine.  This Calling, The Air I Breathe and Whisper (I hear you) are my favorite tracks.
B008XG1X18|4.0|love this app, but takes it a couple of tries to get it open sometimes. just freezes and have to click the 'force close' button when that happens.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|Ok, I (used to) absolutely love Slipknot, but what is this radio-friendly piece of garbage??!!!  I'm sorry, but this is not typical Slipknot, this is a typical move a band makes when they're trying to appeal to the radio and the masses and kill their true sound.  This is not Slipknot, this is a mess of noise tied into an album. I know a lot of their fans may hate me for this review but you know what?  If you understood TRUE Slipknot, you would probably think the same thing.  \\"Slipknot\\" and \\"Iowa\\" were true Slipknot, this is media-sellout Slipknot.  Then went extrememly melodic and soft on us all.  If you are a TRUE Slipknot fan, you might get it to be loyal, but me, I'm not even bothering to.
0316228532|3.0|The myth of Pandora's Box tells of how the box contained all the evils of the world - but at the bottom was Hope. In Casual Vacancy the author gives us a cast of deeply selfish characters who between them exhibit pretty much every vice in varying degrees and commit acts of cruelty and depravity both great and small. What we are not given is any sense of hope. At the end there are hints of repentance and reform, but the book has taught us not to trust such things. Even apparent acts of charity are portrayed as being motivated by selfish reasons. The town of Pagford is a town peopled by grotesque caricatures, where no one can be trusted and compassion is a chimera.<br />Whilst not badly written, I found the book slow to get into and, frankly, depressing to read. My only criticism of the writer's style is the constant use of brackets, which jarred on me every time and broke the flow of the prose. At the same time, the tendency to present stereotypes rather than balanced, realistic characters made it difficult to care that much about anybody. There was very little story to be told and this was no morality tale; for the people of Pagford there could be no redemption. Perhaps the reader is actually being invited to look into Hell?<br />By all means read this book and form your own opinion, but be prepared for a rather unpleasant journey.
B0087JTAKW|2.0|i should have asked for a sample first. It is too weird. Not at all like the book i liked--Tuesdays with Morrie<br />Amazon gives too little time to select and it seems we buy very fast
B00026ZG10|5.0|This is a great film and is a lot of fun to watch. It is your not so serious James Bond movie. With a great cast that seem to just work together perfectly Arnold playing Harry the work obsessed secret agent man who is clueless when it comes to his family. Jamie Lee Curtis playing Arnold's wife who is attention starved and looking for some adventure. Tom Arnold playing the funny sidekick to Harry. Then Bill Paxton who is a spineless used car salesman who lies to women to get them into bed, who just so happened to lie to Harry's wife adding one more issue to Harry's already growing list of problems.<br /><br />This film has absolutely no shortage of humor or action and frequently switches from an action scene to a humor line. Like when Harry steals a USMC AV-8B Harrier and his partner is telling the Marine that he'll sign for it and that its like riding a bike and you never forget how to use one, at the same time Harry is crushing a cop car with the front gear as he struggles to get it off the ground. Or when Curtis finds out who her husband really is and sees him disarm a few guys she utters the words \\"my god i married Rambo\\". The film has plenty of one liners like that which will get you to chuckle and then laugh uncontrollably.<br /><br />This film has a plot that i will not explain due to not wanting to ruin it for people who are planning on watching it. It is a film you'll enjoy watching many times over.<br /><br />5/5 stars its a great film that i would recommend to anyone.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|My kid loves this game!  every time he sees my kindle fire on my night stand he will ask for it and play that game.  This review will be from a 6 year old kid perspective:<br /><br />1 - It is an open world.  I see him just swinging in NYC like the real spiderman.<br />2 - My son does not care about the missions, but there are a lot of bad guys that he can fight against.<br />3 - It is easy to pick up (again a 6 year old kid is doing it).<br /><br />My perspective from the game (the times that I have played it.<br /><br />1 - it is an open world, animations are top notch (kind of like PS1 style).<br />2 - Keeps my kid entertained when we go for a long drive (1 hour or so) or we go to a restaurant.<br /><br />Now it is an expensive app 6.99 USD is no joke, but will I buy it again?  yes I would just because that when I factor in the 7 USD and the times it has saved me from questions like \\"are we there yet?\\" or \\"when are we going home?\\".<br /><br />Now the only problem is that this app is not compatible with the Kindle Fire HD.  Hope they release it before xmas so I can upgrade my kindle :)
B00003CXAT|5.0|I love this movie and man does watching it take me back. Want to feel old? Its been something like 18 years since Jurassic Park was released in theaters. Even after all that time Jurassic Park still leaves me awestruck. The acting is awesome but lets not kid ourselves here the real top star of the film is the T-Rex and they do a good job with the T-Rex especially for being so old it is hard to tell its not real (the CGI parts). Never before was a dinosaur brought to life so realistically and the robotic one certainly looked awesome (leaving me more than once thinking i would love to have that thing for Halloween). I love this film its a classic favorite of mine that is always a pleasure to watch. All the actors play their characters to perfection, the two scientists who are awestruck to see the things they dig up and day dream about are alive in front of them. The old man who just wanted to amaze the world, the greedy lawyer, the two kids who are along for the ride, and the cooky scientist named, Malcolm (Jeff G), the only man who from the beginning respected the power and danger of that island and its new inhabitants. The acting is great you can almost feel the tension and stress in the air at points. I dont think this movie has ever disappointed me. The mix of awe and terror is perfectly done leaving the viewer really happy with watching it.<br /><br />5/5 stars for this classic, it is a nail biting thrill ride that i would recommend to anyone!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun each time you play. prizes puzzles and bonus all in one game. if you are addictive to having fun then thisis the perfect game for you. I enjoy it every time I play.
B004EPYZUS|4.0|I went and saw this in theaters and then bought the DVD and i have to say it is a awesome movie full of action and suspenseful moments. Then lets not forget Paula Patton in a dress that will make the eyes on any guy widen while he utters the word WOW! I still nearly drool at that point in the movie. MI Ghost Protocol is by a long shot the best of the series so far. The mix of suspense, thrill, action and stunts will leave even your most demanding action junkie pleased. This is not a film that will leave much of a long standing mental impression on you, which means you wont walk out of it with a changed view on life. Then again not many action movies will change your view on life. It wont make you do much thinking like other fairly recent films like Inception but then if you use Inception as your baseline for what you like then you will find yourself displeased with movies quite often. Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol is still a awesome movie that has a good plot for a action movie, good action/stunts, and the action was really good. The plot is simple like many action movies but the on-screen things like action and dialog make up for it. Then the car  with a Heads Up Display is in one word is awesome...<br /><br />4/5 Stars Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol is a great movie and i recommend it to anyone who likes action movies.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The Story line was very good, a little disturbing about how and why and the length of time that the hunger games went on in the story . It kept my interest though as too what was going to happen to the characters in the story,and how they would react to the different situations. i would recommend this as a good trilogy to read
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I have heard a lot of good and bad reviews for this series. Personally, I thought it was good. It's not just about S&M, Dom and sub like most think, its a love story. It's literary porn, but a love story. I have recommended to friends and family to check out, its not for everyone but I enjoyed it. :)
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|I just recently bought a 3D television and this movie was my first 3D purchase.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Also liked having the digital copy to add to my iPad and iPhone.  Having the extra Blu-Ray disc will make a nice gift to my son.
B008MEM24S|4.0|This is a great game! Not only is it fun, but it is also educational because it teaches you certain strategies and puzzles.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am addicted to this app! I love looking at all the new things to do in my classroom and in my home.
B008M721MS|5.0|Excellent app but unfortunately this is the only app I got with my kindle fire HD. Alas!!!<br />Thank God skype is there so that I am able to do face time with my friends and family on my kindle fire HD
B0058YPILY|5.0|Once again a brilliant show we are behind here in Australia so its always good to keep up to date with the shows I love.  Delivered also in excellent condition
B00932AA5G|4.0|No Hollywood shenanigans here.  Just an awesome, adrenaline packed movie from Norway.  Gripping from the moment it starts, and thoroughly entertaining.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|the<br />coin dozer is too fun yet addictive. I just can't stop. I play this game almost everywhere. reminds me of chucky beeswax game.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I avoided Pinterest all year but finally gave in. Sure there are some fun pictures but the app seems pretty useless or I'm not smart enough yo fine a use tor it.
B00932A6G4|1.0|Another poorly-voiced, weakly-scripted pile of digital garbage that has the gall to call itself a film, when it's really nothing but an overly-long video-game cut scene. This thing stinks on ice!
B0090EHVMC|3.0|The cartoon was done well and the green message was obvious but I found the movie boring and during parts it dragged
0316227706|5.0|I had a calendar from this same amazing photographer and had to pre-order two copies of the book (one for myself, one for my vet's office as a gift).  Now I will be ordering more as gifts.  It's amazing!  The photos are so unique, playful and adventurous.  The quality of the book is exceptional, nice thick pages, full color, sharp images, etc.  It reminds me of a few nice National Geographic photo books I have.  Excellent product.  I would HIGHLY recommend as essential for any dog lover, a great \\"coffee table\\" book to have around (especially for the price) and a perfect gift for dog lovers, pet owners and/or those who love great photography.  Enjoy!<br /><br />--- update --- I had to order a couple more copies as gifts!!!  Love it! :)
B0084IHVC0|5.0|One of the few Disney movies I hadn't upgraded from VHS to DVD, I'm glad I waited.  The BluRay package was fantastic.  Not only the movie itself with the quality upgrades, but the extras.  Besides what has become the (thankful) normal for Disney (many versions included) there was also a free iPad interactive story app that my daughter has spent far too much time with than I should publicly admit.  Great value overall!
1475143389|1.0|THIS BOOKS SUCKS......DO NOT BUY!!! This clown cobbled together a hodge podge of other people's work and other books and passed it off as his own system. It's TOTAL CRAP!!!!  I feel dumber for reading it.<br /><br />I would demand a refund, but instead decided to keep the book as a reminder to do research before I buy.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A wonderful read. Very provocative.  It will keep you wondering and thinking long after you finish.  It's ending seems frustrating at first, but its twist actually, like the story itself, provides the reader with an impressive array of philosophical questions to gnaw on.  All Pi wants is to be saved.  All Pi gets is what he needs to survive in the most incredible way.
B001F12J0C|4.0|These movies are wonderful, but to say that they are based on Robert Ludlum's books is ludicrous.  The only thing these movies have in common with the books of the same names is that many of the characters have the same, or similar names.  There is no commonality of plot, or action, and the movies stray farther from the books as the stories and episodes progress.  Good GAWD, Hollywood!!!  Had you called them something else, you would have gained more credit for creativity.
B00005NKK8|5.0|Love all the music brought back a lot of memories.. reminded me of when I was young and this stuff had so much more meaning... Times were so very different I was young but grew up with this from my mom
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|it is a fun game to zone out to after a stressfull day.  you just forget all the stuuf that is over working your brain and watch the coins fall
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I finally gave in and downloaded this book to see what it was all about. There are parts I liked a lot and there are parts I did not like at all. I found it to be a very tough read until I was about half way through the book, it picked up a little after that. I guess that this is not my type of read, but I did continue on to the next two books and found that it was much better once you got into the second book. Overall, I would suggest reading it, if you are looking for a fun and provocative read.
B002SRQ214|3.0|I bought this processor to complete a gaming system. The install was pretty straight forward. Unfortunately, as soon as the installation was completed., a horrific whining sound came from the fan/heat sink! AMD has offered to replace the whole processor or the fan! I am not sure what avenue I am going to pursue, but, the noise is too much.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow is a greatly addictive game. If you play enough you'll start having dreams about it. Always a challenge! I challenge you to put it down after 10 minutes and to write a review long enough ... does that do it? yeah? good!
1441869980|5.0|Hounded<br />Book One of the Iron Druid Chronicles<br />By Kevin Hearne<br /><br />Atticus O'Sullivan is the last of the Druids, he has survived for centuries in hiding, blending in with the people around him his neighbors and friends all see him as a tattooed Irish dude who owns the local occult shop in Arizona. In actuality Atticus is twenty-one centuries old, can speak to animals and shape shift at will just being the tip of his druidic powers. Everything is going fine until one day the those that have been searching for him finally find him and Atticus decides after centuries of hiding he is tired and if they want Fragarach, his magical sword known as the Answerer, they will have to come through him. Turning this into an action packed novel from the beginning.<br /><br />I picked this one up thinking maybe I could get my husband to read it with me on our trip. He hates to read but he will listen to audio books with me on occasion, what I never expected was to open a can of worms with this novel. Not only did I love this book and find myself laughing until I cried but so did my husband! This series is full of action and comedy, but it also pulls on your heart strings at moments making this a well-rounded and amazing read. I have no idea how Kevin Gearne came up with his mish mash of characters, from Oberon the poodle obsessed dog, to the sexy bartender possessed by a Hindu Witch the cast of characters is eccentric yet lovable and make the book so much fun you cannot put it down. I highly recommend the audio book version of this novel just for the narration, Luke Daniels truly brings to life the characters especially Oberon who is now my absolute favorite.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl began with a bang and held my attention during the early part of the novel. Then suddenly half way through came the shocker and from that moment I was completely hooked. I especially liked the author's take on the way \\"we\\" learn how to face crises through the examples we see everyday in the movies and television.<br />I really liked how I didn't really like any of the characters (except maybe the sister) the two main characters were so completely flawed but were so good at covering those flaws up for the world. It is rare that I can become so invested in the lives and deaths of characters such as these.<br />I will definitely look for other novels by Gillian Flynn.
B005LAII7G|5.0|I've been hoping that someone would do DREDD justice after the 'fanily friendly' version with Stallone and at last they have!  I usually avoid 3D movies as they give me a headache, so I took some paracetmol with me to the cinema.  What can I say, it was so good I went and saw it again.  Paracetmol, headache and all, it was worth it!  I'm just really hoping they will make another/sequel.  Can't wait for it to come out on DVD!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I would give this book more than 5 stars if at all possible! Seriously wonderful! I loved that for once it was Abby finding that she was the flawed one not Travis being the constant bad luck, it was refreshing and real. I loved the pace it moved at and my heart broke for them when they weren't together. I loved that Travis was never conveyed to be anything but completely in love and even with the few scenes with the other females they were so few and far between and never at a time where it could really come across as him not being in love with her. I am so anxiously looking forward Walking Disaster to read this all over again from Travis's POV, but I would also love to read more on their story, or heck continue with America and Shepley and just make sure Travis and Abby are in there and I'd love reading that too! ABSOLUTELY STUNNINGLY PERFECT!!!!
0439023521|5.0|I've resisted reading The Hunger Games trilogy for some time--but I'm so glad I finally gave in and read it. This is a wonderfully written dystopian novel that really hits at that element of society that seems to gawk at and take delight in the misfortune of others. I can imagine Suzanne Collins watching an episode of Survivor and asking herself, what if it were real?<br /><br />The story is set in a futuristic world--Panem--that used to be North America. The country is divided into twelve districts which are producers that basically supply the foods and goods necessary for the happy upkeep of those in the Capitol, which is powerful, self-centered, and voyeuristic. As a means of keeping citizens in line, Panem sponsors The Hunger Games--pitting one male and one female teenager from each of the twelve districts into a literal fight to the death.<br /><br />I'm not often a fan of first person narrative, but when done well, it can be gripping, as it was in this book. Katniss's story is fraught with danger, action, and even a bit of the confusion that comes with a young girl's first awareness of the attraction of boys.<br /><br />I loved the story and can't wait to start the next book in the trilogy.
B004GPC5OY|5.0|It is an absolutely beautiful work, fine, great care for detail. The sound of the guitars is distinctive of Dire Straits, and the tone of voice of Knopfler.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Was pleasantly surprised at the overall size of this calculator.  Was expecting a very small calculator.  Love the ease of function and the last calculation memory.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think it is a good game to build and explore.  it is also a great game for kids who like to build
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I absolutely love this app! It is more than helpful, but yet can be a bit difficult to get used to. Still worth every penny!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book was a real page turned for me. I finished the book in two days, which is a real accomplishment since I have two kids under two years old.  I could not get enough of this story and these characters.  Such an interesting concept, and it really got my mind turning and thinking, not only about the story, but the author's observations on life and love.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I love this app...I use it for my grocery list...to do list...packing list.  I use for just about anything and I love the colored note feature.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Like most reacher books, this one was hard to put down. It moved quickly and kept me interested.<br /><br />I would always like a more build- up at the end in these books - it finished too abruptly for me - needs to tie up a few more loose ends.<br /><br />Overall a good premise and good story.
1423140605|5.0|Each book in this series gets better and better.  I have truly enjoyed reading how these characters are evolving and getting new experiences.  Can't wait to see where we go next
B002RI9PKO|3.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend, but it wasn't full of inspirational stories of success like I was expecting, rather talking about how people's successes are more a result of the opportunities they have been given. Contained interesting accounts of black box recordings though.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great game one of my favorites great way to burn time wish I could get more of the dozed apps
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|If you enjoyed the game or the series itself, then it is a must have for your collection. It is a great flick, takes me back to the Super Nintendo days.
0385344333|3.0|I have followed Jack Reacher from his inception, He is aging well and has cut down on some of his more violent behavior but can be counted on to rise to the occasion. While I appreciate Mr Childs' formation and development of characters, I feel he does not have the same value for their humanity as the reader does. Seems to me that his characters are sometimes needlessly expendable and that makes a sad story instead of the expected adventure I was hoping for. This book rode right to the brink of credibility, and goes over a few times, but all in all well written and a good piece of escape from reality literature.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great book if your looking for something to get into after reading Fifty Shades of Grey. I loved it! I've already finished Reflected in You. Can't wait for the 3rd in December!
B00785P2QC|4.0|read title :-) forgot about it requiring a title for reviews like I said it was a good game to play
B008PNBU30|4.0|Although nothing can top One-x, transit of Venus is solid ear candy. I got chills when ''Give into Me'' started playing. I'm really liking these covers rock bands are starting to include on their albums. Covering an MJ song can be risky but they pulled this one off.<br />I'll give a more detailed review as I listen further. I absolutely despise this album art though, it looks like a Train album.
B008UG0JJI|5.0|I saw this band recently at a local jazz fest and when I saw this DVD was coming out I ordered it immedialtely.For anyone who only has her CDs- seeing her live is a whole other experience.Our seats were pretty far away when I saw her so its a treat to be able to see everything up close on this DVD.The lighting is somewhat subdued on this stage but everything is clear and the angles are interesting and they didn't jump around too much for the editing.And the sound is superb.<br /><br />This girl has everything-amazing technique-yes-but so much more- energy,commitment and musicality,charisma-and her obvious love for the music all come through loud and clear on here.So many highlights but her interpretation of the Beethoven Sonata is just exquisite.Highly recommended.
B00338QENI|5.0|This book is impeccably researched and presented.  I would recommend this book to anyone in the life sciences, not just PhDs, but also MDs.  While, it does have accurate and well-written science, it is also accessible to those not in the field.  Ms. Skloot does an excellent job of explaining the basics of early cell culture systems and how they have evolved into what we use today.  It is also emotionally grabbing, and the characters are full and relatable, and it faces the implications of race for access to medical care and quality of treatment in the 50s and how the case of Henrietta Lacks and the Tuskegee experiments shaped and continue to influence African-American's perceptions toward doctors and scientists .  I honestly cannot say enough positive things about this book.  If you are a life-scientist, medical doctor, or just someone interested in the history of scientific and medical discovery, this book is absolutely for you.
143350393X|4.0|I was a little concerned when I ordered this bible that I would be unable to read it; however, it is so easy to read. the thinline, light-weight bible is just what I wanted.
0547564651|4.0|I found this book useful and insightful. Provided me a different way to think about how to train children. I have two kids and elementary and this book provided some tips on some other factors to consider.<br />I have studied in two different types of schooling, US being one of them. I do see lots of Pros & Cons with each system. I always wondered how some kids with phenomenal test scores doesn't do that well when it comes to career but other \\"Street smart\\" kids get ahead. This books is an attempt to address it, i think author is hitting on something here.<br /><br />One note though: I felt it quoted quite a few studies done to support the points which gets boring after reading through few of them.

0307383415|5.0|We are truly blessed to have such a thoughtful, rational, compassionate, even-handed adult in the White House. This book is a part of my permanent collection of books from or on inspiring leaders and thinkers.<br /><br />Thank you Obama for your tireless effort to improve the lives of everyday Americans, especially the lower and middle class. We desperately need a strong advocate in the face of the overwhelming power of moneyed interests, at extremes we haven't seen since the last Guilded Age. Hopefully, we can backtrack out of the current Guilded Age we again find ourselves in.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|The Storm of Swords was very much in keeping with the first 2 books of the series.  The twists are great.  I won't even begin to predict what will happen next.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|Dis een van die swakste boeke wat ek nog ooit gelees het.  Ek weet regtig nie waaroor al die bohaai gaan nie.  Ek lees baie boeke - nie net boeke wat hoe resensies kry nie. Daar is geen storie en net seks.  Hoekom hierdie boek uitgesonder word oor al die seks tonele weet ek ook nie want ek het al ander boeke gelees wat ook net die een seks toneel na die ander het.  Ek beveel hierdie boek BESLIS nie aan nie.
B005RAO0GS|4.0|I love this album, all but 3 songs and that is only because of my listening preference. It is a solid album. Most of the songs follow a strong basic pattern and are in the same key and it makes the album cohesive and a good harmonic story instead of boring.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|wads kind of skeptical paying $7 for a game but was very surprised. it has free roaming and the missions are decent. I think the freezing and start oversea vary for each User.I have not experienced any of those problems
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book. This was an easy read simple live story with lots of emotion. A must read for everyone.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|After \\"The Affair\\" and the two Kindle only stories, I wondered where Child was going to go with the next one.  He went right back to classic Reacher.  I saw some of the less positive reviews, and I came away happier than those reviewers.  In my mind, this is exactly what I was expecting, right up through to the end.  The very last line of the story is Reacher summed up.  Its exactly the sentiment that makes it hard to put Tom Cruise in that role.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great game the only downfall is having to wait for more coins. You can of course buy more if you chose to do so.  If you love the coin dozed at the carnival you will more than likely become addicted to this one.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Felt like the 1st book compared to fifty shades but this one has it's own twist that I couldn't put down! I can't wait till her 3rd comes out.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I love it. so fun. I finished it several times though so more levels would make it even more fun thannit already is.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|No complaints here. This is a very long and interesting. Can't wait for part two. I've gotten my money's worth plus some.
B003VTZSFY|4.0|I've always had a hard time reading history books in communist Romania, maybe one of the reasons i was never attracted to history as a teenager. Not one person, regardless of his age, would have any problem reading - passionately, i might add - this comprehensive history book by prof. Ian Morris.
B008XG1X18|4.0|this is a cool app... I've had no problems with at all. the only problem is that it does take a little while to load sometimes...
B005LAIHY0|4.0|The internet states there are some mistakes with lining up the two films (Alien and Prometheus), but it is my beleif that they are not supposed to line up.  This is not a true prequel as we know it.  While this part of the story is Pre-Alien, it is not directly ahead of that film in the timeline.  If these Alien films were chapters in a book, and Alien could be chapter 6, then Prometheus is like chapter 3.  For that reason, some of the origin questions are not answered in this film as this is not the beginning of the story.  It is not a lead-in to the Alien film either.  It only fills in a new part of the landscape. So, basically we are on a 'ride along' with a group of science-type people (Archeologist) looking for the meaning of life.  They proceed with the enthusiasm of a toddler into thier father's tool shed - looking for daddy.  Lots of sharp, complex and potentially leathal things in there.  You can guess how that turns out - but why it turns out that way is the warped part.  As many have already stated, it is a visually beautiful film and the 3D is amazing.  Probably the best use of 3D you've ever seen.  Avatar was good, this is better.<br /><br />Don't expect to be spoon fed the answers like the typical film.  There is no narrator to tell you what's going on.  There is no epiphany where someone figures it all out and spews a meanful dialogue near the end of the film.  There's no summation in the credits.  You just have to watch the film and make up your own mind, but there are some burning questions from the Alien film that you will walk away with.  So, if like Sci-fi films that requires you to think, you'll probably dig this film and watch it repeatedly. If nothing else, there will be some intersting discussions prompted by this film.  If you're looking for 'Aliens', i.e. action action action, this is so not that film.
0525953728|5.0|Great book, lots of good insight into the lives of some of the most brave people our country has to offer! Thank you to all who serve our country!
B009AJDDQU|3.0|The stars go to high production value and stunning visuals. The storyline just seemed like more of the same...group of rag tag scientists, technicians venture into deep space on what they think is a scientific expedition, but the calculating corporate executive and duplicitous android have other ideas. Sound familiar? As much as I liked Noomi Rapace in the Millenium Trilogy, she seemed miscast for this role. Or maybe the role itself was just not written well. The humanoid alien was kind of interesting and from a technical standpoint done well, but all I could think of was Dr. Manhattan from the Watchmen.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Fantistic!  Have read all the series and this movie goes by the book with excellent actor interpretation.  Have watched this DVD several times and felt the emotion more each time.
B006C3Q6GG|5.0|This is the third time I've read this, and it still blows me away. Both the story and the language. Prepare to be pleased!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I picked up the Omnibus Edition as part of the Kindle Daily Deal.  Wow!  This is a combo suspense, science fiction and detective novel that shifts very easily between the genres.  It will appeal to both sexes and all ages young adult and up.<br /><br />The plot flows very well and the characters, even the temporary ones, feel like real people.<br /><br />The books are well edited and have few, if any, typographical or grammatical errors.  You feel like you are right next to the action, not 10,000 ft. (3,000 m) above the scenes.  Kudos to the author!!<br /><br />One word of warning.  As other reviewers have mentioned, these are riveting books.  You will be reluctant to put them down once you start reading.  DO NOT start reading right before bedtime - you will miss a lot of sleep.<br /><br />5 stars!
B002EEP3NO|5.0|this came in a big box. inside the box were four smaller boxes that in lego terms would have been four very nicely sized sets. at the time of writing this i am nearly done with box one and i have a long way to go. this is a very detailed set. every scene from the movies that took place on the death star is here. the fight between luke and daddy, with the emperor. the place where ben turns off the tractor beam. the trash compactor...with trash. it is all there.<br /><br />plenty of guns for those that don't use light sabers. sparks flying from the emperor's hands, even the monster in the trash compactor is there. they have it all.<br /><br />it's taken me some time since i have other life emergencies that call me away from it. i really recommend that you pull out the numbered bags one number at a time. it will go faster. it will still take you some time to get it all together as there are enough small parts to make any masochist lego builder happy<br /><br />this is a great build. if you like legos and like star wars this is the set to get. just get it from lego.com, i think they still have it over there
B008I34YYY|1.0|I am at a complete loss to describe how utterly crappy this was. No, I did not watch the whole thing. It was so bad (and not even funny) that I just fast-forwarded for awhile to see if it would get better. Nope. I threw it in the garbage.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Coin dozer is just as addicting as the real thing but better because you aren't using your own money!  Very addicting.  This game app is well thought out and well developed.  I love it!  My 10 year old loves it as well.  Keeps any age kid busy.  Its great.<br /><br />1/26/17 edit - this app was great....for about a week. It gets mundane and boring. If I had time to waste, maybe, but changing my rating on this one.
B000W237RE|4.0|I downloaded this as a MP3 album from Amazon when it was on the $5 album special. I really prefer the tangible quality of a CD because I'm a collector, but if it's $5 vs $10 or more I can do with the download. I'm old enough to remember seeing the Allman Brothers Band while all the original players were still living. Eat A Peach was so named from Duane's response to an interviewer's question: \\"How are you helping the revolution?\\" Allman replied: \\"There ain't no revolution, only evolution, but every time I'm in Georgia I 'eat a peach' for peace.\\" I hadn't listened to the album for a number of years (I owned it on vinyl only) and I am was pleasantly surprised at how fresh it still sounds all these years later. This album, and it's predecessors, are the Allman Brothers at their peak. All the tracks are good. If you like Southern rock, this album should be in your collection and on your play list.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|The wizard of oz is a good book with many wonderful surprises that makes you feel like you are right there in the book
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|phenominal book!  i've been reading Steven King for 30 years and this is one of my favorites.  A total page turner with a wonderful, complete ending!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|this game of snagry birds is addicting like the origninal. playing it when im waiting for someone is always the best because once i start playing i cannnot stop. I love it so much.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Amazing books.  After reading the first book at a friends urging I gave into it and finished it two days after the second book came out.  As i finish the second book I am not patient to read the next.  Hurry!!!!
0525953728|5.0|This was an excellent book. It was extremely well written by the author and was very interesting. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
1609611543|5.0|This was recommended by a friend and I was somewhat skeptical but upon reading the chapters available in the review I was intrigued and opted to purchase the book. I am amazed at the effects and impact that this genetically enhanced wheat has on the daily diet of so many people. I am equally amazed at the vast number of health issues that correlate to the wheat consumption.<br />Our family has chosen to adopt a wheat free lifestyle and within a few weeks we all have seen benefits.<br />I am pain free in my ankle and feet joints, of which I thought were becoming arthritic. We all have lost weight and inches.<br />I would challenge anyone to read and adopt the Wheat Belly way of life for just 30 days and you will be convinced and will become advocates to your family and friends just as we have.
B007SGM084|1.0|The world must be very sick to enjoy such trash. This book is nothning more than Porn for the sexual deviant. Sadism is not normal. It is a mental illmess. To glorify such behavior is a sad testament to our society. I am so very sorry I bought this book on the recommendation of the media saying it is  a good read . There should be a rating on books so that people like me can avoid spending money on trash. The rating I give this book is XXX rated.
B0092G1O8A|5.0|I'm not someone who ordinarily reads/enjoys fiction, but the Hunger Games Trilogy is wonderful. Can't wait for the next movie to come out.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is a good way to kill some time.  however its just a series of simple mini games so set your expectations accordingly
0307346617|5.0|Tonight as I've been looking for a new book to read I've noticed that many of the titles I've looked at cost more for the kindle version. What the hell is going on Amazon? Printing and shipping haven't happened for the kindle version, so why would it cost more? I know the answer... the publishers want more. I wouldn't have an issue with this if the majority of the authors saw more money heading their way, but I doubt that's happening.<br /><br />No sale for me until the price is more inline with what I'd expect a digital copy to cost.<br /><br />It gets a 5 star rating because I don't want to hurt the author, but I haven't read it yet. Maybe when I find it for a good price I'll write a proper review.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game I really cant wait till all my coins regenerate so I can come back and play again. I wish the real game was this easy at arcades :)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Amazing read, definitely in my top 5 books. This is a charming, funny touching story. I think everyone would enjoy this book, it kept me laughing all the way through and then crying at the end.
B008Y1RTUG|3.0|I really liked this whole new take on the Snow White story.  This was definitely very action-packed (guys would actually like it) but for us girls, a little more romance would have been nice.  The end was a little frustrating because it just left you hanging but I hear there may be a sequel.  If so, then I am definitely looking forward to this story continuing.
B00992CF6W|3.0|its a great game all in all but its nothing like the PC version. There is no crafting no zombies creepers ect. All you can really do is fly around and make buildings and houses. good game if you have never played before but would recommend the PC version
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I loved the new prometheus movie. I Was expecting it to be more like the other Alien movies. It wasn't much like them at All. It was actually still a very entertaining movie! I was glued to my seat and can't wait to see what happens in the next movie! It's funny how people either love or hate this movie. I loved it!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|The one app I use across all devices and platforms. It's great for jotting quick notes, saving emails, as well as storing web articles for education and research. Highly recommended.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I don't have many issues with this except occasionally it forces app to close and I have to reopen.  Hopefully this issue can be fixed.
