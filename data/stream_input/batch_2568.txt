B00AIQP9DE|2.0|Not a lot of hidden puzzle scenes. I mean it has them, but there are a lot of other puzzles. Not real clear on what to do.
030758836X|5.0|I love Gillian Flynn's novels.  This story is so unpredictable... I loved it.  It kept my attention until the very last page.  Highly recommend this novel.  GREAT book.  Hard to put down once you start.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great book!! Story kept my attention and the ending totally blindsided me!!! A mothers worst nightmare!! A must read for everyone!
0307341577|5.0|Gillian Flynn is my favorite author.  I have read all of her books.  I have never been disappointed by her stories.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book started a little slow and took a couple chapters to get into. Once you did, it was hard to put down. The end left you hanging without a definite conclusion, which was frustrating for me but some may appreciate. Overall, a good read!
B008AYA7WE|4.0|I enjoy playing this game on the back porch when cooling down after a workout.  Graphics are a bit retro, but that adds to the &#34;ambience&#34;.  Sometimes the figure in the &#34;on deck circle&#34; doesn't appear next as &#34;advertised,&#34; especially after an accelerated drag down of the current figure...but it adds a little challenge/fun!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Here's a book that is hard to put down, as it follows two completely different men in WWII...but who will forever be connected. One of the better books I've read...a true story that is truly amazing.
B009XY97VC|5.0|Got this CD for Christmas and it's really awesome! Two Steps From Hell at their finest.<br /><br />Favorites: Tracks #4, #9, #14
B0053O89KG|5.0|THE TWO MAIN STARS FILLON & KATIC HAVE A CHEMISTRY THAT JUST FLOWS OFF THE SCREEN. HAVE ALWAYS LIKED NATHAN FROM THE FIREFOX SERIES AND WAS REALLY HAPPY TO SEE HE GOT IN TO THIS SHOWS. THE CASES THEY GO ON ARE ALWAYS INTERESTING. AND IT BEATS THE HECK OUT OF ALL THE REALITY SHOWS THAT STUDIOS THINK THEY KNOW WHAT PEOPLE WANT. IF YOU GET A CHANCE GET ALL THE SEASONS AND WATHC IT FROM THE BEGINNING. YOU WON'T BE SORRY. AND WATCH FOR SEASON 5 COMING SOON.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|A very absorbing and at times a frustrating game. It does make you think outside the box. Some rooms seem quite easy to conquer,others a real challenge.
B00005JKHP|4.0|A LITTLE SLOW BUT STILL A GOOD MOVIE THAT LEADS TO THE REST OF THE FILMS. IT WAS GOOD SEE THE ORIGINAL CREW BACK TOGETHER
0316017930|4.0|The book is a good read, maintaining the twist on the topic at hand as per other of Gladwell's titles.  The only criticism is the stretch to accept the correlation between agricultural styles and educative approaches seen in contrast between Asian and Western culture.  I do not think it's a well-supported argument.
B0000AUHOH|5.0|ALL THE ACTORS DID AN EXCELLENT JOB AND FOUND MYSELF NOT WANTING THE FILM TO END. TO BAD PEOPLE HAVE TO GET OLDER AND CAN NO LONGER MAKE THIS TYPE OF MOVIE
0385528752|5.0|A great analogy of the rider, the elephant and the path.  I keep recommending this to co-workers in the hope some of these ideas will stick.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|The movie by itself was alright, but if you've read the book you will not appriciate the movie - too many discrepancies!
0062073192|4.0|While it lacks the &#34;real&#34; looks of the hard-cover  it is a very entertaining book, a must for hardcore fans.<br /><br />As a GM tool for pen and paper RPG based on SN, it has &#34;some&#34; useful information, but Bobby singer's Guide to hunting suits this role much better.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey Series 3 continues to be entertaining. I love the interaction of the servants and the family. I loved being able to  get the series on Amazon Instant Video, it was very convenient!
0062103377|4.0|Lots of information, do's and don't and a nice insight to the hunter's world.<br /><br />This and &#34;The &#34;Supernatural&#34; Book of Monsters, Spirits, Demons, and Ghouls&#34; have become my inseparable companions for my Hunters RPG sessions.
B00BJ64FU0|5.0|Love to read anything written by Arthur Conan Doyle.  Sherlock has been my favorite detective for all my life.  Starting with Basil Rathbone and later Jeremy Brett.
0452289963|5.0|This is an east read with some good ideas we all should be doing in our daily lives. Get it....you won't regret it!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book and highly recommend it.  I found myself wanting to keep reading even though I had others places I was supposed to be.
B0063IH60K|5.0|perfect for those moments while you  wait for appointments. Quick enough to quit anytime and the jump back in.Yeah! great mindless fun.
1476719071|1.0|What a childish book.  Soooo disappointed after seeing all of the reviews.  Like other reviews I was very mislead! The 2000+ who gave it 5 stars must all be college age because anyone in there 30s, 40s or older will be terribly bored.  If your looking for an adult love story with hot romance read \\"up in the air\\" or \\"crossfire\\" either one will be far more entertaining. How would you like to spend a very good portion of this book reading about kids going to class, eating in the cafeteria and going to frat parties???  Really?  And what love scenes ?  They were mediocre!!  Branch out and read the two titles listed above and then see how you feel about this book.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Love it it is a really good thinking game and with scary effects and I just love it way to go.
B0065AVWGU|5.0|I love this movie. Good storyline, great characters, lots of action, and sex appeal. I highly recommend it to anyone that likes a great movie based on a graphic novel.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|i like that I can combine different sounds together, & it will play in the background even when I use other apps.. however, the volume is a bit too low..
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I think it is always challenging to get an unbiased opinion of a book if you haven't seen the film, and vice versa. I loved the film, and because of the film I was inspired to read the book. I really enjoyed Charlie's character, especially how endearing he is. I was surprised the entire book was told in letter format. I would recommend this book to someone looking for an easy read. (Even though I like the book, this is one of the rare occasions I like the movie more!)
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|only issue is that is will stall or lock up on kindle fire.  have to reset my kindle and then it will run fine for awhile.
B001NA6096|4.0|If you appreciate the excitement, humor, awkwardness, self-exposure and exploration of connecting with someone for the first time, you'll love this movie. It is one long all night conversation between two interesting--one passionate, one cynical--young adults that gets slightly tedious but not unforgivably so.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|This book is a ton of fun and always makes you want to read more! I definitely recommend Diary of a Wimpy Kid Book 3.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|10 minutes into this I wanted to blow myself up just to make it stop!  Get the British version and be educated by David.  This Oprah version makes me ashamed to be American!  Why do we need our own dumb-downed versions of everything not produced in the U.S.?  Lets not forget British English is PROPER English and just sounds all around more intelligent, and David just adds to the intellect of this program along with ALL of his other works!  Aside from Oprah's verbal raping of my auditory senses, a beautiful collection of amazing footage!  Hell the Brit version is even in full 1080p versus this 1080i crap!  Take a look at the reviews, 1.5 - 2 starts with 150 +/- reviews on this version and 4.5 - 5 stars with over 1000 reviews on the other.  Now I am going to shower with boiling water and a wire brush to get the disgust off of me, cry myself to sleep and receive my DA copy tomorrow.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|An amazing book with its great detail and plot I hope they are all as good. one of my favorite books.
B0085YOD1A|1.0|Download got corrupted and haven't tried downloading again, so I can't say anything helpful since I've not used the program
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Very good scenery  pretty interesting storyline especially for mystery buffs.  As with all the big fish games, the graphics are outstanding.  I have played almost all that are available for kindle, and I look forward to any new releases coming up!
B00COMLLX2|2.0|There not much to say with this, I got it on a whim and don't play. So if you like get it as a filler and be happy
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I love the pace of the book.  It was realistic, believable.  The chemistry between the characters was magnetic.  Terrific story of hesitancy, risks, and faith of love.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is a great story with a great surprise.  I can only hope that when the movie comes out in Nov 2013, that they stick to the writing of the book. Can't wait to see the movie.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Well done. So much work goes into these films. They don't really emphasis the females as much as the other films and have trended away from sexy scenes.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I have bought two of them and they are really nice and made very well. Just what I wanted and all my lens and camera fits in the bag just great.
B008J344BQ|5.0|do I even need to say how good PINK is? She writes and sings her life very plainly. This album is lighter than the FUNHOUSE even from the very first tune! Recommended
0515153656|5.0|Great book, now I'm hooked on Jack Reacher and I will buy more of them. Hard to put down once you start reading.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I watch a lot of movies and must say that this movie is under rated. Not only is it moving but a story that gives accounts of human nature, it's passions, it's failings, it's heights as well as it's depths revealing the things we repeat over and over again in various forms/ways/lives. Equal to the people we find ourselves gravitating towards, behaviors.<br />i also loved the score/soundtrack to this movie.<br />I still listen to it to this day:)
B000001FFJ|5.0|Tom Waits will take it to you for sure. This album ranks up there in my opinion. If you know Waits you know when you hear him. If you don't know Tom then give a listen for sure ,and keep your third EyE OPeN!
B008AT71WI|5.0|I have always enjoyed this movie! The cast is perfect for it and many of the players have gone on to do so many other movies and tv shows. The music  and story are funny and memorable!
B008BDZP3K|5.0|Absolutely impressed , I believed I listened to it about 4 times in a row when I first received it. Now that I'm rating it I think I'll give those HOT RATS another listen!
B0043EV774|5.0|Very colorful,Though it is not the best from him, it still is very whimsical and enjoyable. And Alice's trip is still trippy!
B000BC8STM|5.0|well i like it becouse i have it vhs so i want in dvd so free shipping now that a deal . by the way i've been a cher fan for a long time.
B00867GKIK|5.0|The 3D is very well done and this a great story that I think every age can enjoy. 5 Stars!
B00CL50LEC|4.0|This was a cute movie, a bit juvenile, but still entertaining. Actually though, it had some pretty scary scenes and the skeleton zombies were done very well... too well in that our young kids were not allowed to watch.  Although this wasnt a movie I'll be adding to the collection, it was worth the rent. All in all.... a good, clean zombie movie meant for a slumber party of highschool girls.
B005NFWCSK|5.0|I grew up watching the X-men cartoons and this has been my favorite X-men movie to date! They weave the narrative well into the historical cold war occurrences of the time.
B00633W614|4.0|Great epic tale but be ready to be disappointed at how Archer leaves the reader until the next installment.  This is not a TV series like &#34;Homeland&#34; and should have been done in two volumes not 5
B000FCKC4C|4.0|I chose this book because it was on a list of life changing books to read. That is a true statement of this book. Eye opening and one to remember.
B00309MF06|3.0|Cute, formulaic, kinda wholesome, and as usual, bad sets, boring songs, good dancing, great supporting characters.<br /><br />This movie is riddled with inconsistencies. Ryan and Sharpay are rich; they don't need a scholarship, which is a big plot point.  How the heck does Mr. Bolton have a house that fancy on his salary as a High School Basketball coach? How come so few actually eat lunch in that lunch room? Why does the jock Troy give the valedictory speech instead of the brainiacs Taylor, Gabriella, or Martha?<br /><br />In three movies Hudgens has gotten no better at acting or singing. She always looks as though she's counting how many beats before she says her line. It's hard to watch Efron act with her, or Coleman, because they are so much better that it calls attention to her woodenness.  She is cute, however, and I doubt the ten year olds the movie is made for care about her acting.<br /><br />Once again the greatness is in the details: the quietly gay Ryan is a work of genius. Not a big deal that he's gay, it's just who he is.  Troy makes sure HIS college choice is close to his girlfriend's, not the other way around. The plus-size girl is not only in the dance finale, but front and center! I LOVE that. (It's still too much to ask to have a cute guy interested in her, but progress all the same.)  While the main plot is a fluffy and silly romance, the film still aces the Bechdel test, as the female characters all have names and interact about something besides who they are going to date.<br /><br />When my little girl watches this, she knows it is OK to go to Yale and that you don't have to put that off for a guy. She also knows it's OK to try for Juilliard.  (She also thinks it's OK to dance on the lunch table, but you can't have everything.)
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|It's a good movie. Made me laugh and cry just a little bit. All in all a great movie. Good for a family movie night.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I purchased this book for my wife to read. Since she began reading I haven't had to listen to her at all! She simply can't put the book down. Best investment in tranquility I've made in years.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Excellent read. One of the best books I've read in a while. Can't wait to read the next book! Epic!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|In this game there is a &quot;red neck&quot; driver and he drives around different places.<br />By  you control the car. You are the driver.<br /><br />  -Mel<br /><br />Thank you for reading if you did!  -Mel
B00CW665VI|4.0|Oh Drew! Wow this book was SOOOO funny, there was so many parts where I caught myself wiping away tears! This guy was one funny character, and I loved that the whole book is told on a guys POV!! The little information he shares about how guys think was amazing!! When he meets Katherine this girl isn't going to drop her panties like all the other ladies do and of course he thinks of that as a challenge, the story line is great and I would love to read more of Drew and his crazy ideas. LOL
B0086700CM|5.0|In my opinion I like TR2 more than this one but, this game is AWESOMEEEEEEEE.<br />The creator of this game is a genious and very creative to come up with the most<br />rated game ever! I have had no problems with loading/starting up the game. You will love this game right from the start!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I watched the episodes of all three seasons back to back and finished in about 5 days. This is by far the best show on television. Looking forward to season 3!
B00AQSN7HE|4.0|Daniel Craig made a bold and impressive debut as James Bond in 2008's \\"Casino Royale,\\" and contained a credit I thought I would never see again: \\"Based on the novel by Ian Fleming.\\"<br /><br />Fleming had largely gotten lost from the films since his unfortunate death in 1964 at the age of 56. He liked writing thrillers, and I have tried to follow his rules in my own (see to see publication, thank you very much). As a result, the films were taken over more and more by studio marketing chiefs trying to wring every possible nickel out of the franchise, and in the process, everything that made Bond special became drained away, leaving a vast money-making machine in its wake. Despite the general excellence of Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan in the role, they could not overwhelm flaws in the scripts. By the time we got to the invisible car in \\"Die Another Day,\\" fans had had enough.<br /><br />The producers wisely decided to take Bond back to his intelligence roots, and thus, the gritty and realistic Craig. \\"Casino Royale\\" preserves the best of the novel, and includes a few innovations. Le Chiffre (the perfectly cast Mads Mikkelsen), for instance, is under the threat of death from some of his dissatisfied clients. We'd nevr seen that before. The producers wisely changed the game from chemin de fer to poker, which everyone understands. Eva Green I found delightful as Vesper.<br /><br />Craig has apparently taken Fleming's novels to heart, and given us the Bond we never saw in the last 50 years of film: a nasty, tormented soul, haunted by past demons and not at all at ease with what he has to do for a living. He's actually dangerous, and he pays a steep price for revealing a very human heart. This is the Bond from the first chapter of \\"Thunderball,\\" something particularly emphasized in the recent \\"Skyfall.\\" He has truly given us the most human Bond yet.<br /><br />The film is not without its flaws, as is typical of all too many Hollywood outings. Doesn't anybody check scripts for logic holes and anomalies? If Bond had only asked M, \\"Why not just kidnap Le Chiffre?\\", the film would only have lasted 20 minutes. They needed a better excuse to go ahead with the poker game.<br /><br />I also found it deeply disturbing about the way you apparently advance in the British Secret Service, and I'm amazed there was no outcry. This is how different we've become since 1962, when James Bond shot someone in cold blood and audiences everywhere came down on producers Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman in droves of fury. Until \\"Casino Royale,\\" Bond never killed anyone in cold blood again. Brosnan put it best: \\"Killing is a filthy business.\\"<br /><br />But to win promotion these days, it takes two kills? Am I the only one who sees some problems with that? The 00 designation is special, a license to kill in the line of duty. There are rules, and this thinking certainly undermines the British tradition of fair play. Some more thought should have been given to earning this rank. I also think It's sad that today's audiences are so comfortable with cold-blooded murder, fictional or not. I like to think we're capable of better.<br /><br />But don't let my quibbles spoil what is otherwise a most thrilling and worthwhile reinvention of a great character. The Craig era promises something special for James Bond, and it got off to a roaring good start.pts for logic holes and anomalies?

B00CUWWLWG|5.0|great game for a time waster would not recommend for young kids its a little bit complicated.  to speed game up you would have to spend money<br />enjoying playing so far
B00992CF6W|1.0|I would recommend survivalcraft it has more than this abomination this is a fail survivalcraft has buckets, electrically ,real animals, wild animals and more.not to mention updates every 2 months in the next will be farming
1435122968|5.0|All the Lovecraft you need (besides his poetry) in one vast tome. It looks like a Bible, with its sleek silver tinged pages, and its purple page marker. However, it definitely doesn't read like one! This is great stuff. Inspirational for aspiring horror writers, and succeeds in making the reader think about the vastness of time and space through stories that transcend the pulp magazines they were once published in.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Good cop, bad cop.....intense shows and a really good watch for crime series people who like action ...hope you enjoy it
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I like zombie movies, in general because they are creepy, action packed and keep you at the edge of the seat. For the most part regular Zombie flicks can be quite predictable, and after watching a lot of them it almost feel like their story lines blend together. This one on the other hand had so much different in that made even the plot holes/slow moments ok.<br /><br />It had good acting, both main characters had a good chemistry and the storyline was very enjoyable.<br /><br />Now this movie wont be winning any awards, but I can say that it was funny\and just left me with a happy smile on my face.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Outstanding description of a phenomenon that connects us all. I have said all that I want in a few word.
160459201X|4.0|Great information but a little repetitive, Also a few typos and ill spaced sentences exist in this version of the book, other than that I am continually enjoying this book
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I like the book but I wish I had it on my computer to refer to from time to time.
B007XIC1GI|4.0|I was surprised about this book.  I am not too familiar with MM but the book was an interesting read.
B000FC10MU|5.0|Did not know where the story was going - completely unpredictable and a fascinating read. Just what you would expect from Gaiman - bizarre but thought-provoking.
B0063IH60K|5.0|give this appl a try. you will have many hours of fun with this.  just give it a try  love
B00CFQN12Q|3.0|This movie wasn't terrible but you'll wish you had just stopped watching after the last Die Hard movie came out.
B001BANK32|4.0|I read this 25 years ago and it was so scary I had trouble sleeping.  Cut to 25 years later and despite my belief that it wouldn't be scary as an adult, it still managed to get in my head.  This is a downright frightening story and an excellent and gripping read.  I re-read this because I am a devoted Stephen King fan, but also in preparation/anticipation of the sequel coming in fall &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34;.  I cannot wait!<br />Sidenote: I highly recommend &#34;Blaze&#34; if you're looking for a great read.  It's from the sadly unloved Richard Bachman/Stephen King group of books, but this story doesn't disappoint.
B00BY8DFRW|5.0|Great vynil edition! If you are a Deep Purple's fan you must have it! Wonderful album, wonderful sound!!! Check it out!
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Good memorable fun and I'll never look at 100 the same again.  Humor is not easy to write but this is an easy read.
B00C2ISGRC|3.0|The steelbook it's great. Special edition drom people that are collector. The Book Of Eli, a movie to see and think!!!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Another app that makes the kindle incredibly useful, other than for what its intended for!<br />I no longer need to use my phone for my alarm!!!! Perfect!!
B00002SSKI|5.0|I loved this movie as a child, and re-watching it as an adult is just as good. Must own for every girl out there.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is one of the rare instances in which I saw the movie before reading the book. The book didn't deviate from the movie very much. The author's use of Eagles football as a metaphor for the main characters' recovery from serious mental illness was ingenious.  It is the main reason I enjoyed this novel so much: I know people like this, and there is no getting away from football, ESPN, or any form of sports in my house.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I ordered the u-tube app. on my Kindle and i could never connect. The screen says having problems connecting, try again later or cancel. Has this worked for any Kindle users? I tried emailing them to no avail.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Good game play, fun music and graphics implimented beautifully. Addictive, with just the right mix of difficulty and achievabilty. Top job.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|One of the best Tegan and Sara albums ever! It's definitely fun to sing and dance to! Absolutely LOVE it!
B000FC0SIM|4.0|I would recommend this book to all Stephen King fans as well as anyone who is an aspiring writer. I enjoyed getting a sneak peek into King's life and his work. This book was full of King's witty prose and great advice for beginning writers. Its both reassuring and refreshing for someone as successful as Stephen King to say that there is no magical guideline for excellent writing. He reminds us that the most important thing is to enjoy writing, keep your writing honest, and just do it!
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Very Old School, lots of fun!!! Reminds me of the old NES games. My 7 year old daughters loves it also.
0321356683|5.0|This book covers many advanced topics and is a must read for every Java developer. I would recommend it to everyone who wants to become a truly professional developer!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This is a must have for any Facebook user who wants a quick peek. Good to see Amazon introduced Facebook sharing as an option, I only had e-mail sharing before.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A deeply intense book.  It had me spellbound.  I wanted to cry for this lost girl who is so strong.  Thank you, Colleen  for appearing on TV so I could learn about you and your books.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|The game is flawless in design, it's very fun to play but it tends to get boring after a short while.
B001NA6096|4.0|Thought it was great but hate cliff hangers. Glad I didn't have to wait 9 yrs for the sequil. Can't wait to see the final chapter. Before Midnight
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Tried the others, ES is the best solution for any Android device, I use it on my Nexuses and my Kindle, it's great, I especially love the fact it has a built in file archiver, so it makes my life easier. I don't like the app icon at all, I am a designer, I'd love to make a new one,  developer if you are reading this, let me know :)
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I was disappointed in this book.  Subject matter was okay.  I LIKED The Kite Runner and looked forward to reading this. Other people might like it.  Probably a matter of personal opinion so I would  say others may enjoy it.
B008JJM88Q|3.0|Not a big fan though, I tried it with obscure figures, politicians, etc, not great. Contributing to the database is pointless, I don't want to do the genie's work for him :)
B007FH9GA6|5.0|Excellent. I love both Swedish and English versions The characters are intriging and smart. The land is lovely and the stosy is always a mystery and fun.
B00006AW2O|5.0|this is the absolute finest british rhythym and blues thee ever was. Keith learned all the licks to those rocks and they gave it everyuthing.<br />it will be many a day till anything this energetic and charged with the the joy of beling alive comes a long.<br />This is some of the greatest music ever made. anywhere, anytime by anybody!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this book! I'm glad the author is extending these books. Just wished there wasn't so much time in between them. I will read them anyway. I've seen lots of bad reviews from people who havent even read this book. You can't take advice if they haven't read them yet. Read it! You won't regret it!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This book reflects all the connections we have, good or bad, that affects people around us.  I enjoyed it in our book club at work.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I love this game. Its my favorite, its the bomb diggity just great freaking great I cant get enough of it my kids love it too I wish they would make more games like this the graphics are great.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|This is a typical Nicholas Sparks novel. It is full of passion without being racy and is wistful like a Hemingway. A good quick read.
B0000VCZKM|4.0|Love the songs,love the dancing - love the cheese! Carol Burnett is AMAZING!  She reminds me of my own mother in this movie,.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I want to hang out with Tina Fey.  She is witty and honest and totally someone I would want to hang out with.  After reading this, I started watching 30 Rock on Netflix.  I watched 6 seasons in about 3 weeks!!  She is great.  Tina....call me!!!
B005C8ENI0|4.0|We really enjoyed this movie, although we had never heard of it. We always enjoy Matthew's movies. Nice twist at the end.
B008D30K7E|5.0|Loved the book, quirky and great fun, very cleverly written.  Very unusual book but would highly recommend it to everyone.
1881273873|5.0|I had initially picked up one for couples...excellent, but since I am a single and didn't discover he wrote one specifically for singles until I had read the other one... much more info in this one.  Have recommended it to a friend and would do it again if someone needed it.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|So stoked on this new CD from Queens of the Stone Age.  I am seeing them at Red Rocks this August and I can't express how excited I am.  This CD rocks.  No one can say there is not any good music made any more because here it is, right in front of you.
B00CWVF2GC|5.0|Chad Knoller was fine actor. Honest depiction of a real problem. It was affecting  his job and his health. Subtitles were easy to follow.Excellent sequel.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The first 80 pages are truly unsatisfying.  Unsure you proceed on and then you are hooked. He has a nice way of weaving all the lives and stories of the characters but the names are difficult to keep track of because of their origin.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I'm only half way through this one and am spellbound !!!  I've decided to work my way through all of the Jack Reacher series and have now finished #1 and am in the middle of #2.  LOVE IT.....Will continue till I catch up.  He is some guy, that Jack Reacher.
B001XUT6AG|3.0|The movie was good but not great. I am not a huge star trek fan but still found it enjoyable even though it was fairly predictable. I think if you are a star trek fan this is probably a 4 or 5 star movie.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Loved it.  What a weird town !  So sad about Jack's brother, and sadder still at the ending chapter(s).....Can't say why because if someone who has NOT read this one decides to, I don't want to spoil the plot.  Suffice to say, I am a confirmed Lee Child's fan and definitely a Jack Reacher addict !
B001L5VYFI|5.0|Saw them in Milwaukee in 73 or 74 and they played everything from 4-way street except Southern Man....All in all... the best of thier best!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Its really addicting but after a while I started to get really bored of it.<br />You should get it though because they change the places that you go to like<br />Miami and places like Tht I cant remember the over ones.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Perfect for everyday household use.  Easy to use with a large display.  Great for banking, recipe conversions and any math problems.<br />Use it all the time!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|A spirited cpu chip. It really moves processes on my computer and for the price, it's an economic no-brainer compared to its i7 big brother. I have tested this chip on upcoming big title betas and it hasn't shown any signs of slowing down.
0345803485|5.0|This was purchased to complete a set for a friend.  She had books 2 & 3 but book #1 she lent out & never got back so now she has the full set!
B009MYARIK|4.0|I loved it! funny! The kind of book you picture as a romantic comedy! I liked it because as a reader you alternate between cheering for Lottie and Fliss and Ben and Richard. If you like Sophie Kinsella you'll love it - enjoy!
B000AY74OG|5.0|I purchased this dvd for our home library.  Our grandson loves it & other children that come to our house love watching it!  Cute Movie!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is my favorote game I have ever owned on my kindle fire.  BEST APP EVER YOU SHOULD GET IT.
034580404X|5.0|This was a great book!  It was kind of unnerving at first but then you realize this stuff does happen to this day!
B00846REIS|5.0|The first book of this series sets a good story for the other books. I love Eva and Gideon. Both are strong characters.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Purchased this to add to our home library.  I couldn't have made a better choice!  This is a very cute movie!
B00COHIFQS|3.0|Bland story with a CGI ghost.  Nothing new or interesting really, typical haunting yarn.  It did kill a couple hours for me when I was bored.
0345803493|5.0|This was book 2 of the 3 book series & wow things that you read were totally unreal but then again this stuff happens even in the real world!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Never before have I read a book like this. NEVER EVER!!!! Sure, the story line was pretty typical. Playboy meets woman who rivals as his equal and isn't afraid to go toe to toe with him. She puts him in his place and in the process he falls in love with her. But what made this book so incredibly unique was the writing style. It deserves a reward for being so refreshing! The perspective was from the cocky guy and it was something like first and second person mixed together. It was honest, funny, cute, and steamy! You can't go wrong with this one.<br /><br />Bottom line: A must read!
B00BSBY38A|4.0|I don't think it will appeal to everyone but my wife and I found it to be interesting and entertaining,
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|Love this CD!!! Have been a New Kids fan forever, and like how they &#34;change it up&#34; a little on this CD! Very well worth the money!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The series is one of our all-time favorites. Can't wait until it begins a new season. It's both civil and interesting and also very entertaining. We never are able to guess what will happen next.
0425263924|5.0|This book isn't like the first two but its right where it needed to be in the middle of book four and five. We begged her for it not to be a trilogy like fifty since fifty left to much out. Sylvia did as she was asked and is carrying on the series I'm glad I own the first three and I will gladly pre purchase the next two. Great book
B00CH87HF4|1.0|Game is fun but extremely buggy. I have no confidence in paying real money for items if the unpaid stuff is so bugged. I have waited 10 hours several times for items to upgrade only to find them bugged so I can no longer use them and just wasted 1mil good and several hours. I removed this from my kindle.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This book was epic!! I've read all the books and Nalini Singh did an amazing job! Bravo!! Can't wait for the next book to come out....and now my withdrawals begin...
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I'm not going to write an exhaustive review because I simply don't have time nor do I want to. I will simply list the pros and cons in no particular order. Here we go:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1). Great looking set, visually impressive and well made.<br />2). Tons of extras.<br />3). Video and audio quality are excellent, even in our razor-sharp, Blu-Ray world.<br />4). I don't care if your political leanings are Republican, Democrat or extreme nutjob this series is not as political as you might think.  It is more right or wrong and patriotic vs. a vehicle for the liberal folks out in L.A. to gain political followers.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1). A tad pricey unless you can find it on one of Amazon's lightening deals. I got it for $79.00 + free shipping.<br />2). You MUST be an intelligent person to enjoy this show.  If you are I.Q. challenged go watch Chris Matthews.<br />3). The cardboard folders inside are a tad flimsy and prone to ripping if you're not very careful replacing the DVD's.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B002KGEORM|5.0|Awesome show. If you are into this type of stuff, you will LOVE this show.  There is a little bit of everything - killing, romance, etc.  Amazon Prime delievers!  Great quality, no ads.  LOVE IT!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I had seen postings on various websites about this game and decided to finally try it. I was not disappointed. It's a fairly laid back game but that's not to say it doesn't require some pretty quick thinking and well thought out strategy in order to destroy all of humanity muhahahahaha...sorry.
B00AKKTDJY|2.0|This is my first review of an app, and the only reason I am leaving one is because of how annoyed I am at Play First. I got Cooking Dash Dexluxe when it was the free app of the day. I was excited! I love time management games. The app is usually 99 cents, but I didn't pay anything. When I first opened the game, the first things I noticed were that I had all 12 restaurants unlocked, and that there was an obnoxious amount of advertising for their other games, both on the home screen and a pop up after completing a level. At some point the next day, the app updated. Sadly, all the other reviews about bait and switch are true. My 12 unlocked restaurants went down to 6, and in order to get them back, they want you to pay $1 per restaurant or, hold onto your hats, $3.99 for all six restaurants. I dislike paid games that require more payment to play, but telling you that you are getting a &quot;deluxe&quot; version of your game and then locking it down until you pay, since -hey we aren't paying customers, right?- is just ridiculous. Uninstalling until I get all my levels back. Don't try to make your money back off of us because YOU were the ones who agreed to offer it for free. I will be sure to rethink any other downloads from this developer.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I chose this book because I'm a fan of John Grisham. As expected the story has good plot mixed with some humor. I would definitely recommend this book to any one interesting in litigation in mass tort court trials. The story fast paced and relevant to mass tort cases. If you are fan of Grisham you will not be disappointed.
B005OLF6BI|5.0|If you love taylor swift you will love this video.<br />It feels like you're right there at the concert with her.<br /> Long Live Taylor Swift !!!
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|While the movie is great and I wish I could leave my review for that, I'm very upset that after entering the code for the digital copy, seeing the credit on amazon instant video, I was instead charged on my credit card another $$14.99 on top of what I payed for the blu ray, DVD/digital version.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game has good graphics and its fun to play. I also like all the other games from g5 all good thanks.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|The wait for a truly amazing Superman film is over.<br />Great Acting, great musical score, great effects, great premise and moral...<br />Simply perfect!
B005H9B44A|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. It had great acting and a good storyline. This is a must see. Appropriate for all ages.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|I have read the books and decided to watch the shows since I've heard so much buzz about them....and no new books in the series have come out lately *hint *hint.<br /><br />The production is excellent I just feel like I'm watching the &#34;Cliff Notes&#34; version with lots of important little details left out.<br />If I hadn't read the books first I really wonder if I could have figured out what was going on in the premiere episode.<br /><br />I did like the depiction of The Wall and the Iron Throne, both of them were hard for me to visualize as I read causing interupptions to the flow of the story as I kept going back to the descriptions trying to &#34;see&#34; them in my mind.
B00CLZ4B4I|2.0|My wife and I rented this movie without knowing the plot. It had a bizarre twist to it, it was interesting. I personally thought it was a chick flick just because of the romance, drama, etc. I like the older version but I guess this is a different modern twist. It also looks like there could be a possible sequel.
1451627297|5.0|I normally don't read Stephen King novels because I dislike horror. But I love to read about time travel; and 11/22/63 is an excellent example of this genre, which also succeeds as a beautiful love story. Additionally, the research done to write this was excellent. The writing not only held my attention, but I found myself thinking about the characters and the events of the narrative between readings. Sometimes the story became so intense, I had to put the book down for a time. In spite of the fact that this book is science fiction about time travel, Stephen King makes it seem entirely real. I am very impressed.
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie was good overall but the filming was poor. In the beginning the camera is constantly jiggling, moving up and down. I eventually got motion sickness. The books were far better than the movie. I hope the second movie is a bigger budget film so that they can improve on a few things. The acting was quite good. I was surprised at how much gore and blood they showed (though yes, it is a tough, violent message overall). I would have rated the film R if I had a say in it. I wouldn't recommend taking kids to it, but that's just me.
B009EDUCDO|5.0|There is literally nothing wrong with this film. (500) days of Summer take the audience on an emotional rollercoaster and makes the viewer(s) feel like they are actually in the movie. :) Amazing writing, amazing cast, amazing director, stunning visuals, its a masterpiece of a movie:D anyone who likes love, even a little bit, should watch this movie. And to those who think that this movie will just be another love story, its not, \\"its story of love\\"
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Pretty good overall. I wouldn't watch it more than once but my kids enjoyed it and laughed; that's what matters.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is cool, but can you add the multiplayer for minecraft PE to kindle tablet edition? This app is for Apple products like iPod! So it would be great for tablet.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|This third movie was pretty good. I wouldn't say it's as good as the first but they still keep you entertained and laughing. I wouldn't buy it, just rent and  see what you think first.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book is really good. The author explains with so much detail that it would be impossible for me to write this book.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Action packed, from beginning to end. It also contained good one liners, always fun. Acting was good. Would recommend to others.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Kinda of addiction. Though it's fun. Nothing like real horse competitions though;) but it's great time consumer. And is great animation.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|My family and I enjoyed this movie, we ended up purchasing it. We liked the message they portrayed, strong family values and ties. I would recommend it.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|This is very nice DVD just like the movie that I was treated to by close friends upon its first release! I highly recommend this to anyone who is adult that like Channing Tatum or any of the nice actors who are in this movie! I found the quality to be excellent and glad to have my own copy of this movie! This has a very good story line that the movie has with insight to what goes on before entertainers do before preforming in front of live audiences! I have already recommend this movie to other adults! Thank you!
B00CX1TSSO|5.0|I'm glad I didn't pay attention to other reviews and comments about this movie, it turned out to be great. Nice modern twist, would highly recommend.
B008XCM18Q|5.0|There is no denying a classic, and in the Spy/Action genre, this is undoubtedly a classic. I rate it five stars because it is action packed, and re-readable.
B004RL9T50|5.0|This movie had us laughing from beginning to end. It is a great family movie as well as for adults. We were laughing so hard we had tears coming down. We had to watch it several times because we'd miss parts from laughing too hard.
B001EC0OMW|5.0|I love watching old horror movies. I have fun finding the discrepancies and editing errors. Mostly they take me back to my childhood when one could enjoy a double feature of campy movies for a couple of dollars (including popcorn and drinks.)
B001609SQA|5.0|This movie never gets old. I've watched it many times and still enjoy it. Wish they made more similar to these.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|This makes it easy to download and view photos while on vacation. A great way to share photos with fellow travelers.
B0007DFJ0G|4.0|I would have rated it a 5 star (as I did the first time)  but seeing as how I am having to RERATE it - Im giving 4 stars just for the waste of my time.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|This was a book for which I had low expectations based on some of the reviews I read.  I was interested in reading it however because I am a hiker and thought I would have, or gain,  some insight into this subject. It turned into an entire different reading experience; one I couldn't put down.  I usually read in the evening before going to sleep but not during the day.  I found myself looking forward to my time with this  book.  The protagonist and first person  narrator,  Cheryl, was a person that had experienced what I considered a horrific childhood, a confused adolescence and turned out, not surprisingly, to a thoroughly messed up adult.  She tried to climb out of this condition by undertaking what I thought was a quixotic &#34;quest&#34; to find herself by hiking the Pacific Coast trail alone, a journey of over a thousand miles.  Never mind that she had never hiked any distance before and that her knowledge of the endeavor before she left was gleaned from reading or internet research.<br /><br />I found myself thinking of her as deluded, thoughtless, just plain stupid as she undertook her quest with all the mistakes and misjudgments she made,  but I could not help but admire her and after a while I felt as if I were on the trail with her.  Weeks without a bath!  Hiking boots too small!  Hunger and pain! And yet she pushes on.  I found myself getting into her head and thinking, you go girl!  I also found myself feeling somewhat superior and thinking I would never have made most of those mistakes.  But the reality is I could never have done what she did.  I kept thinking this was a non-fiction memoir but in fact, based on the epilogue, it seems that is a work of fiction (I think but am not sure)  Anyway, I loved the book.  It may resonate more with women readers but anyone who has ever wondered what a month's long hike alone might be like would gain insight into that adventure by reading this book.
B004GYY714|3.0|It works great, sometimes a bit hard to control, but it works fine.  The search can be quirky, but I think that is part of the fact that the content is sometimes so random.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Season 7 left me wanting more!  I can't wait to see how the latest story line plays out. Dexter is well written and well acted. If you are a crime drama fan you will like Dexter.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is an awesome game. You should really get this app! I play it everyday. It can be really addicting!
B006IYG5HE|4.0|Aside from his snickering name, Harry Hole is a fascinating hero. He is a very real, complex character. The stories are never dull, and you can count on one element to recur. Harry will doggedly pursue what he thinks is the correct path, even when discouraged from doing so by his colleagues. I understand why Michael Connelly calls Nesbo his &#34;new favorite author.&#34;
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The new update continues to crash my wireless and crash the app! Needs fixed asap!! Can't do anything on here which is very inconvenient since I'm trying to run a business!
B008J5G3QI|4.0|Fits well according to size. Rather tight and does not easily slip on, requires tugging on to your foot. Very comfortable.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|I love this game and enjoy it but it is not the full version.It has awesome dresses .I gave it four stars.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I came across the Sookie Stackhouse series in the late summer of 2012. Amazingly, 4 days after I finished reading Deadlocked the final book, Dead Ever After, was released. I read Dead Ever After in less than 24 hours and it was bittersweet when I reached the last page. There are 13 books in the series altogether and I have thoroughly enjoyed every single one. The book series, which I suppose falls under the category of urban fantasy, is definitely worth your time even if your fan of the HBO television series which quickly takes its own direction with the story and development of the characters. Charlaine Harris is an amazing writer with a fanciful imagination that definitely appeals to me. So, good bye Sookie Stackhouse, fictitious heroine of the south, it was wonderful getting to read about your life in Bon Temps!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|When I first heard of this book I figured \\"why not I have nothing better to do\\" needless to say I loved this book and I can't wait to read the others :)
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book was crafted very well. The constant shifting between stories gave the book it's edge. At first it was hard to get a grasp on how the book was laid out but it proved a fantastic read. Well done. I recommend to all, especially those studying for the GRE. ;)
B005H9B44A|3.0|The movie is okay, I guess it was intended for a younger comic book audience.  I think all the creative parts came from the comic book story; cardboard characters.  I think this was meant to be an exercise in special effects and action.  There were opportunities for more depth that were missed, for example in the relationship between Thor and his father.  The actors were good, I just don't think the script and dialog was quite up to snuff.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Its an awesome game ill give it that but it would always freeze up my kindle and wont undressed it until I shut it down then turn it back on.
B007IK44CK|5.0|You know that if you're an action buff you're going to love this movie.  I thought that after M:I-3 there wouldn't be much else to poke fun at, but when Cruise goes back and hammers that phone to &#34;help&#34; it self-destruct, I thought I'd fall out of my chair.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I think this is an awesome app it works great..runs smoothly I have had no issues with it..my aunts got me into this and I have been playing ever since...very addictive once you start.....great
B0054SMID0|5.0|Rarely does a character translate so well from the book to the movie.  This movie really leaves you wanting more.
B004HD61KE|5.0|At the best style of James Rollins, what he suggest here is paramount, the way that he tied reality with fiction is very convincing
B00A81MV3U|2.0|So I liked this movie but maybe I love the idea of it more than the final product.  It got so much hype that I finally watched it.  I love Bradley Cooper and Jennifer together.  But I thought the ending was so lame.  It just didn't pay off the way it should have, and after all of their hard work, I thought why not amuse the heck out of us with the final scene, but instead it was confusing and clumsy.  As if the crew was packing up to go and didn't want to give the director enough time to shoot the ending properly.  It all fell apart.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I like the game. I really can't put it down. Keep up the good work. I've even showed it to my kids and now I have them hooked on it too.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I love this C.D.  I enjoy listening to all the songs, but I actually bought it for just one song.  I received the C.D. in quality condition and in a very expedient time frame.  Kudos!  Hey--would I steer you wrong?  You can--COUNT ON ME!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Roller coaster, ride hang on with a white nickel grip and do not let .  Easy to get lost in the story.
B00B2GK4KW|5.0|This product is so amazing. What beautiful paper edges you can make. I don't know what I did without this. I have bought two more edges to play with. A must have for any scrap booker.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I downloaded this app thinking it would be great because I watch youtube a lot on my iPhone and computer. I was very disappointed because it crashed as soon as I tried to use it the first time. I tried it a few times and never could get it to work. I removed the app, I never got to watch anything on it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The new update is so fun!!!! I have been dying for buckets and then boom! Buckets! but it wont let me sign up for realms
B0095ZEAAM|4.0|Perhaps the best told story in the series. No a lot of gaps in story structure. Was able to maintain my willing suspension<br />Of disbelief throughout.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I revisit this book every year or so and it gets better each time. It's surprising, raw, emotional, funny, soft and intense. Everything a good novel should be.
B0094M2SCI|4.0|This movie is a must have in the series. Performances and camera angles are superb. ROL IS perhaps the best story in the series.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Interesting and fun to use to burn time, one I will start my children on when they are old enough to read and understand
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This is a great app for writers who need to edit manuscripts and short works on the go. So for I have no complaints
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This app is small and convenient. I love being able to tap this app and see how much charge is in the battery as well as my battery health.
B007L7JY3Y|4.0|I've had the 2Do app on my Kindle Fire HD for months and did not use it because it was soo buggy. Thankfully the developer fixed the known issues that were driving so many of us crazy. I just downloaded the new update and the app seems to work flawlessly. Now I have the option to sync to dropbox, create/edit/save a task with out having to constantly rotate my device and even the keyboard works better. So I'm now very happy with this app (just hope they add back the wood theme, because it was my fav)<br /><br />I'm giving it a 4 star rating because I feel that this would be even better if it allowed for wireless syncing between devices without the need of a third party app such as Dropbox or Toodledo
B002N5N4M6|5.0|A much better deal with you.  We will enjoy this. We could not find a better DVD. Thank you. Lamar
B00BRR66SA|5.0|I absolutely love this CD.  every song on here is great and I don't run across to many cd's  were  every one is a hit. he really put his heart into this cd.  my favorites right now is\\" that girl,  suit &  tie  and strawberry bubble gum\\"  just to name a few... lol!
B00BF123WG|4.0|Excellent movie, great cast and great take on the UBL highly recommended for all to watch.  Only downside was that I wish they took more time on going through the actual takedown itself.
B0092W59VW|5.0|I'm excited about anything Calexico comes out with; they never cease to impress because they're always up to something new. Favorite track: &#34;Fortune Teller&#34;
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was really disappointed by Sylvia Day on this one. So much so that I returned the book. There is no plot to this one and it would have made a better chapter in the next book then being its own book entirely. I thought she was rude the way she ended the book with yea this is really the end! She knew readers would be disgusted, I think we should have ended on the last book when the two of them are happy and doing well.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|I would recommend this to any of my friends, it was suspensful and had a great ending. My husband also enjoyed this movie.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|My wife broke her case when it fell 4ft.  Called LifeProof and found out this product was a counterfeit product.  Went to Best Buy and the actual product is 100% better.  better sound, better parts, easier to see the screen.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this movie and it makes you think long after its over. Acting was amazing and I would like to see this again, lots of hidden meanings......wonderful! Might not refer someone to this that loved DUMB AND DUMBER :))
B00821OX98|5.0|This show is perfect Summer time viewing.  Character development is very good although the storyline writing is a bit choppy.  Overall very very good!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It was cool and in the first 10 minutes I was in the 3rd level. This game is being recommended by me!!
B004AFFZNI|5.0|This case has worked well for me to record lab session in school.  Good audio reception and video.  Easy to plug in download cable without opening the case.  Product was as expected.
B00992CF6W|5.0|They need to update this game like Apple does we pay as much as they do need we need<br />  updates the same!!!!
B009NY43NY|2.0|I think it is a silly cop out on the story that was built through the previous books, trying to fit in all the characters one last time, but with no real depth.  The plot was contrived, the behavior predictable, and the ending between Sookie and Erik was flat with none of the emotion present during their relationship.  All together a sad fizzle.
B00C7DGRL4|5.0|I wonder why there wasn't more hype around this movie. Maybe there was, I just didn't pay attention. Anyway, this movie is full of action and it is super gory, I had NO idea it was that gory. I hope they come out with a sequel. I thoroughly enjoyed this one.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use calculator at the touch of my fingers. It has served my purposes. I use this calculator daily and rate it 5 stars!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I don't care for violence although this movie is like a game of violence it also has a love story behind it that is genuinely real.
0765334798|3.0|There was a lot of potential in this book. A lot of new ideas and interesting developments got touched upon. But in the end it remains a sloppy book where all of that potential never got the chance to grow. Maybe if Scalzi had taken more time the result could have been a fantastic book. Where it stands now it's just okay.<br />Also, there were a couple of editorial mistakes (the use of wrong names at the wrong time) which kind of jarred the reading experience.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I'm not sure what the options of listening to it are, very confused. I did download it to my computer therefore it is on a playlist, although I wish it could go on my phone and other devices. If anyone knows how this works let me know. I have an iphone.<br /><br />Thanks, Ann
B00APUQRPC|5.0|This was a decent father-daughter relationship movie centered around baseball. It wasn't an amazing movie or anything like that, but it was entertaining to say the least.
B0036T1RMM|4.0|Some really wonderful performances by an ensemble cast, and it's a layered movie. We actually watched it twice in two nights just to be able to catch more of the show.  I thought it was really enjoyable, and the music is great.
0439023491|5.0|These books are so well written they become extremely addicting! Once i started reading, I went straight through and finished the book in two days.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I just finished reading this book and words just can't explain how I feel knowing how he died in the end. What a true Hero.<br />On a happy note,I am just glad that he was on our side.<br /><br />JSM<br />US Navy<br />68-72
0439023513|5.0|I found this to be the best book out of the trilogy! Just be sure to pace yourself, otherwise you will be finished with it in a day!
B003KRJNBW|5.0|I'm usually not a fan of the post-apocalypse genre, but the strong spiritual theme of this movie makes it a winner for me.  LOVE Denzel!!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This album is simply stone cold brilliant, surely an excellent way for Sabbath (most of them) to reunite. Now what I notice is many people hate this album, however what they hate isn't actually the album/music more so it didn't live up to the idea that they had. People don't like to admit that what they're expecting in a new album, even more so from a band who has had the original line up in decades is the sound they're used to the same songs. Which is why you find people who only like one or two songs from this album, typically Zeitgeist (since it is similar to Planet Caravan). People need to get over it, you're not required to like every song on any album of any artist, simple as that, doesn't mean this isn't a fantastic album. I'm personally not a huge fan of \\"God is Dead?\\" but I still rank this album 5+, it stands up with any other Black Sabbath album hands down.<br /><br />Specifically the bonus track Methademic is my favourite, it's nice familiarity of snowblind or sweet leaf but in the opposite direction, condemning it in a sense. This product is worth the $ with no doubt.
0452295548|1.0|I am a nurse, found this to be a difficult and uninteresting read.  Sorry for being critical--just sharing my opinion as requested!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Love how it tells you how many hours and minutes you have left. I would totally recommended this to some one.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This free app does everything it says it will: provide you with a file explorer. While not the sexiest of apps out there, it is EXACTLY what all of us need. I use my Kindle for work and it is such a pain in the neck to find files that have been saved -- which is equally true if you're just a casual user. Ever wonder where those saved images went, because they're not showing up in your images folder? Try the file explorer and you'll be able to see everything at-a-glance. This has saved me SO much time and aggravation! I love it!
B0018OFN1S|4.0|This movie was fun to watch and had a lot of action with a good story line. This is the first of six movie series and once you watch one you will want to watch them all!
B000FA5STS|5.0|I really like almost all of David Baldacci books. I really like his story telling. As usual I cannot put down my Kindle and read when ever I can. I am just finishing The Hit and will start on another of his books.
B00007KWHP|4.0|Fragile in relation to &#34;Close To The Edge&#34; is prog-rock still not at its top but with good expectations.<br />This record sounds good. Shipment to Germany was no problem.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I love David Baldacci's books. I especially love Will Robie. I am reading The Hit, and cannot stop reading into the middle of the night. Cannot wait to start my other David Baldacci book.
B00881PTRC|5.0|This game is truly addictive, fun, and gives you many different categories to choose from as well as funny quips and scenarios form the hangman as he's dying.  Try it, you'll love it!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The &#34;MasterPiece&#34; is a splendid depiction of challenges, triumphs, and follies which has bedeviled humanity since the dawn of time.  All characters were masterful in their acting skills and subtle with their innuendos or politics.
B00CL6GAD2|3.0|Would not go to see it at the theatre, it is not worth the prices there.  But good value for home viewing.  Lots of action.<br />Kara
B005COO1X6|4.0|Stephen King has a way of pulling you into a story. Here we are at an abandoned rest area with an old dirty station wagon. People are missing and kids are caught up in something not of this world. Realistic characters face something not quite real. This was a page turner with too few pages. Viva King!
B00BEYX7TW|5.0|Truly enjoyed this movie.  2nd time we have watched it.  Husband loved it as did our dinner friends this evening.<br />Kara
B00C1C0WCQ|4.0|I have to say, I liked this movie better the second time.  I think the first time I saw it I suffered from &#34;it can't be as good as the first&#34; syndrome.  It might be offputting for many people that the movie in large part centers on the least likeable (iMO) of the main characters from the first movie, Ian Malcolm.  Once you get past that and just enjoy it as a movie in it's own right, there is more action and spectacular effects this time around.  The story is a little predictable (arrogant first timers think they have it handled then everything goes haywire and a crucial mistake is made, etc.), but it's well acted.  It was interesting to me how good this movie looked.  Considering all the technology advances since this was first relased, it is hard to think of many recent movies that LOOK as good as this one.  Maybe not as groundbreaking as the first, but still very good.
1780540574|5.0|My son loves Justin Bieber and all he wasJustin bieber merchandise.  He loves the calendar and the the pictures of Justin.
B007RXC3A8|5.0|My favorite SA album since 'for the sake of revenge', although Unia and Days of Grays were alright I didn't care to listen to them heavily after those.  This one restored my faith, and I hope to see them live sometime soon.
B003U69IX6|3.0|I wish the screen writers would have followed the book! The movie is an extremely watered down version of the book. While the movie is fun to watch, if you'd have read the book, you'd be disappointed. Rick Riordan is a great writer and didn't need a screen writer to come along and change his great story.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Bought it as a gift for my friend and it was great. Honestly, you don't need to read reviews for this movie. It's obviously amazing.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|This is a good season.  We finally get some answers about what happened to John Teller.  Introduces a few new characters.  The finale isn't my favorite though.
B005YDLJ76|3.0|It's ok. It wasn't life changing or anything. I bought it so that my family could watch something entertaining after thanksgiving dinner and it served its purpose.
B001K3KK0Q|5.0|After going to see the 2013; Leonardo version, I had to return to this, the one of my generation.  I loved Baz's vision and Leonardo was great, and I do very much think that it captured the senses of the twenties better than this 1974 classic.  However to me Robert Redford will forever be J. Gatsby.  And Karen Black will forever be Myrtle.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|it's adele and she's amazing. this is def not something you want to listen to if you're depressed, but all other times it's just great music.
B0016YBFZ8|3.0|Not necessarily a bad movie for others but I did not like it very much. I was disappointed since I like almost all Scorsese films.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book was a great read. It kept me enthralled to the very last page  and can't wait for the next one
B0034DGPEU|3.0|Interesting  Was hard to keep people straight. Didn't like the way written . Two stories at once. Book club choice.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|Quick charges, white LED light, Good length of wire, high quality, bought one for me and then one for the wifey
B00280LYIC|5.0|I love this book! I remember when I ha  my first kindle I got this first because it seemed pretty cool, but I didn't know  how epic it would be! I am now addicted to this series and the heroes of Olympus series
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|Kept me wanting more, kept me guessing, i loved how the story unfolded and how it ended. would highly recommend this book
B006IYG5HE|5.0|I am in the process of reading all of the books by this author since reading The Leopard. This is my 4th book by him and I am still loving his writing style, the character of Harry Hole and the rich mystery. Highly recommend his books if you love a good mystery!
B00CL66FEQ|4.0|But once again we could not watch the entire movie... It froze up at the end and in the middle. Amazon movies have been doing alot of freezing up very sad!
B005IQZB14|4.0|This book wasn't my usual kind of book but was recommended by a friend. It was engrossing and powerful and I was drawn in to the adventure. I can't imagine myself doing what the author did - hiking a trail alone, without hiking or camping experience. I admire her courage and conviction....
B0098VXMNE|3.0|The nudity and violence are fun to a point. Afterwards the characters just stop being that interesting. Well, the female characters do develop some amount of complexity and you want to watch what happens, but Spartacus is SO one dimensional and uninteresting that it's a huge drag on the series. If I could just skip the whole Spartacus-Crixus parts and watch the politics unfold (with all the fun parties) I would continue watching!
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|A friend turned me on to The Leopard by this author which I absolutely loved. The Snowman is probably my second favorite book of his so far - I am reading them all this summer. Kept me guessing right up to the end. The main character, Harry Hole, is a flawed human being who is also brilliant at solving crimes. I am growing to love him.....
1451627297|4.0|As for Stephen King novels go, this one was pretty good. It is really long (about 850 pages or so) and, in my opinion, doesn't have a  great ending. But if you are a Stephen King fan, you should pick it up and give it a read. (Plus, I read that JJ Abrams has been picked to make the film--so maybe you want to get a jump on it before the price goes back up.)
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|A real page turner that warmed up the further you read.  Difficult to put down.  One aspect I thought was a bit disappointing was the sudden end and leaving one wanting to know more about what happened to the various characters.  Did they all live happily ever after...?
B007U4DIM6|5.0|This is a very delightful family movie about the pets we have and love.  This is a movie for all ages.
B008MM9630|5.0|This is a fun and addicting game for the whole family. Got this on my kindle and it great but have a hard time getting updates for it but would still reccomond it to friends and famil
B000EF5NAS|5.0|This is a good movie about several women who stick together in good times and bad.  It is a good old fashion movie to watch.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's the best game I played and it teaches kids how to take care of horses<br />I play this game all day long
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This is a movie about some individuals who have to take care of taking care of our country, even after they have retired.  It is a very good comedy.
B004P7CN5O|5.0|I chose this movie because I love Tarantino and George Clooney. Simply pure kult. I can watch it over and over again without getting bored.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was a book that took you on  the journey of a young girl's life and what she did to survive.  It held your attention and each chapter drew you more and more into her life.  It told of her troubles and how she managed eah day both good and bad.  This book was fun to read and I enjoyed the ups and down of the entire book.  Highly recommend.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very entertaining to say the least. So life like and real looking!would recommend to anyone that is interested in horses for sure! 5 star
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have loved it ever since I got it and always will. But Apple has so much faster updates ,and wished they were faster.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game as and it is worth all the money. I wish there were more updates because i have tons of sugar and nothing to do with them. Overall, a very fun and entertaining game
0321714113|4.0|This book covers the new standard in C++ and about everything else you need in order to understand and use the language. It's nice that the programming exercises sometimes comes back in the book at a later stage as code. It's far better than the book; thinking in c++. The book is covered with back and forward references to reminding topics that's make it very nicely cross referenced.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is the best game I have ever played on my kindle fire buy  it and you won't  regret  buying this game plus it is free.
B008TRH5N6|4.0|A very informative & insightful book. Also very much written with the lay person in mind. And it never gives any ridiculous suggestions.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Great finish to the trilogy. There are a lot of little side-stories going on that are irrelevant to the main story line but they are interesting. But then, real life has multiple stories going on at the same time. If you liked the first two books, you will need to read (and enjoy) this final chapter.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I love Gideon & Eva & there are definitely lots of great steamy  & heart racing pages in Entwined BUT what a way to leave us hanging! The abrupt stop was just bizarre. Plus there is  a lot going on with increasing number of secondary characters. Enjoyed some of the twists & turns but some seemed more like page fillers.  Still a huge fan & I will see the series all the way too the end but PLEASE do not yank us around with long months of delayed releases. Keep the heat & story line moving by doing justice to Crossfire.
B001NLKT60|5.0|A totally different story involving the same primary characters as in &#34;The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo&#34; minus the Vangers. Harriet does make some cameo appearances and of course, hops into bed with Mikael. There are a lot of little side-stories going on that are irrelevant to the main story line but they are interesting. But then, real life has multiple stories going on at the same time. If you liked &#34;The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo&#34;, you will enjoy this next chapter. If you've seen the movie, this book fills in the details.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is AWESOME!!!  It keeps me quiet for endless time.  It's like every good game leads up to minecraft.  So much stuff too do in one game mining,digging,farming,'name one.  I'm just trying too buy this game!!!  Even though it is worth 7 dollars it is worth it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I liked temple run, but I love temple run 2 play it way more than I ever played the 1st one!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I like the book left me hanging there needs to be another book. But this time sooner then what this one
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is such a fun game very addicted but just a heads up if your the people who don't like endless games this game is so fun try it!!!!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game is one of the most gripping, original, depressing, fascinating, and satisfying novels I've ever read. I never knew I liked sci-fi until I read this book. Orson Scott Card is a master of storytelling and realistic human thoughts, emotions, and actions.
B00BJS7104|5.0|Quentin you have done it again! Great story - very well acted - so entertaining - we LOVED it!  We'll watch this one over and over again I'm sure! DJANGO is a BAD A$$!
B003O86FMW|5.0|A wonderful continuation of The Hunger Games. The author does a good job of drawing the reader into the story. It kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire length of the book waiting to see what was going to happen next.
B007RCJNDE|5.0|I'm sad the series is finished and yet loved the ending. I cant wait to read it again. Good job
B001XUPGLY|4.0|Everyone's got their favorite Star Trek episode or movie; this one is mine. Sure, a little corny in spots, but I suppose the environmental part is why I like it so much. Having watched this recently after not seeing it since last century, the feeling is still there.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was in my recommend list for a while but it wasn't until I saw it on Stephen King' s favorite books of 2012 that finally bought it. I'm so glad I did. Great characters, a riveting story and authentic dialogue kept me guessing throughout. The end blew my mind. I can't wait for my wife to read it so we can talk about it.
B008JFUO72|4.0|The \\"Iron Man\\" series has been like a shot of adrenaline into the superhero movie franchise.  It had one of the best `origin story' films ever (equal with `Batman Begins') and, even when its sequel was underwhelming (as it was with \\"Iron Man 2\\"), it is still a lot of fun.<br /><br />  \\"Iron Man 3\\" steps up the sequel game a notch.  While it doesn't quite reach the excellence of the first film, it is an improvement over the second.  The third installment doesn't pick up at the end of \\"Iron Man 2\\".  Instead, it follows the events from 2012's epic blockbuster, \\"The Avengers\\", as Tony Stark makes repeated reference to events of the `Battle of New York' causing him problems with sleeping.<br /><br />  In \\"Iron Man 3\\", Tony obsesses with building more Iron Man suits in preparation for the next big threat, to the constant irritation of girlfriend, Pepper Potts.  The next threat is very real due to a series of terrorist attacks executed by a shadowy figure known as the Mandarin.  On the front line of these assaults are a series of genetically engineered super-soldiers who posses enormous recuperative powers.  Tony Stark's first attempt to stand up to the Mandarin backfires horribly, forcing Tony to go on the lam to try and keep the people close to him safe while he investigates the source of the attacks and formulates a response.<br /><br />  \\"Iron Man 3\\" has added to an incredibly strong cast with Sir Ben Kingsley portraying the Mandarin and Guy Pearce as the once nerdy, but now suave, Aldrich Killian, whose chance meeting with Stark 13 years earlier had a profound impact on each.<br /><br />  Robert Downey, Jr. continues to `own' Iron Man and Tony Stark.  After having enjoyed his performances over several films, it's hard to imagine anyone else so perfectly encompassing Stark's combination of arrogance, insecurity and thirst for justice.  Gwyneth Paltrow still remains solid as Pepper Potts.  And, while I do like Don Cheadle as an actor, I still think Terrence Howard was abetter fit as Rhodie.  It's a shame whatever dispute that kept Howard out of the sequels could not be resolved.<br /><br />  All in all, the action is as good as in any of the \\"Iron Man\\" films.  Unlike \\"Iron Man 2\\", the threat-level is much higher and more palpable.  This is definitely a worthwhile summer blockbuster.
B0011N1WE8|4.0|For some reason I don't ever recall the previews for this movie. It's really cute and the colors are very vibrant. And I feel bad to say that her face fits the nose pretty well. I wish there wasn't gambling or the witch, without those things it would've been a Perfect movie and easy to share.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Lots of fun to play. It starts easy and gets more difficult as the game  progresses. I highly recommend it.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I came to Downton Abbey late and had to rely on waiting for the previous season on Netflix until a friend suggested buying the series to date (through season 3) on Amazon.  I could hardly believe it when I found the set for $38.00!  I expected to pay far more.  It arrived quickly and safely and I was able to watch the third season one DVD after another in just a few nights.  Now I'll also be able to watch all three seasons repeatedly until Season 4 is available in the U.S. next January.
B0017VT5E8|4.0|We like the movie.  Sylvester Stallone was good in it as always.  It was a depiction of Rocky after winning and how life goes on.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Great movie, I love it. The Tarantino movies I've seen were all great, but this is my favorite. My second favorite is Inglorious Basterds.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This story got to me...I could hardly sleep after I watched it.  Naomi Watts was amazing. The sorrow she portrayed for her lost children and husband and yet the determination to stay alive for the child beside her was so intense you thought you were watching a documentary.  As a parent, this would have been an unbelievable night mare and the movie sent that message right across the screen.  VERY GOOD!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|very fun app love the colors.  love the different species of fish<br />. my kids love this app and so do i
B0036S4C6G|5.0|intricate, complex, well written, keeps one engaged to the last page, innovative.<br />The multiple characters feel alive and the snapshot of each in different time frames makes time itself  and the serendipity of life central figures to it all.
B00BBW15R8|5.0|This is a wonderful movie of friendship, hope and living life with disabilities.  The interaction between the two men is priceless.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I've been reading the Harry Bosch series for many years.  I never tire of these books!  Harry Bosch is a gem!
B003O86FMW|3.0|I started to read the Hunger Games, and thought it was a really brilliant book!  A &#34;novel&#34; novel, if you will, that was over too soon, and left me wanting more.  Catching fire, on the other hand, seemed to go on and on.  It seemed to be tedious, and while there were some great descriptive passages, and some great action sequences, overall, it was a bit of a slog to get through.  Had I borrowed this from the local library, I would have returned it half-read.  As I was travelling, and had it on my Kindle, I kept reading.  Oh well.
B005HEPN06|4.0|Next Generation is an awesome Show . I would give it 4.5 Stars but that's not offered . I'm a Trekkie and love all the shows . The first shows with Kirk  and Deep Space Nine are My Favorites .
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|You can only take so much of this conspiracy within a conspiracy, and who do I trust sort of thing.  He first book had me on the edge of my seat, and this one had me yearning to get out of my seat, and do something else, anything else.  Heck, it is such a &#34;wonderful&#34; book, I don't even really remember the ending!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|ALL RIGHT NOW!  Ozzy's back with Sabbath, Rubin produced it, Bill Ward is OUT....but all is good and BABA BOOEY SHOULD GET THIS PIECE OF VINYL!!!!<br /><br />NOT as good as Cross Purposes or Forbidden, but 13 is up there.  Sounds as if they recorded this right after Sabotage...it's GREAT!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Having watched season one and two, we just couldn't resist season three - it is a terrific show.  Whereas we could find the first two seasons free on Netflix and Amazon Video, we had to pay for season three.  We thoroughly enjoyed it.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|warning: once you start this series, you will need to read it all the way to the end. Or shall I say the end as we know it, the end so far. Unsurpassed character driven fantasy. Addictive, inspiring, earth-shattering, life-changing.  And I am not exaggerating.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I would like to THANK everyone who has forewarned us with reference to book number 3 not BEING the end of the story. I too have waited months to finish this great love story;I will NOT buy the book on principle.<br />Again THANK YOU everyone.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|We didn't see this when it first aired, but now we are hooked. It is laugh out loud funny, and have other friends watching it too.
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|I bought David Crosbys Voyage, and loved it.  Stephen has been a favorite guitarist of mine for many years.  His song writing is also clearly just amazing.  How did one so young write the mature lyrics of For What It's  Worth?  I saw him play with the boys last summer....and his guitar playing has never been finer.  What a rich legacy from the man who engineered, and played most of the instruments on CSN first album!!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|S<br />P<br />O<br />I<br />L<br />E<br />R<br />S<br />!<br /><br />I just feel the need to vent a little bit. Overall, I really enjoyed the trilogy. I definitely enjoyed this book the least however. I've never been involved in a war and won't pretend to know what that does to a person. That being said, I feel like an inordinate amount of time was spent dealing with Katniss' emotional trauma. I think I would have enjoyed the book more if she were just a little mentally and emotionally tougher. Sometimes it just seems as if we have to discuss over and over again her brokenness and it gets to be too much. Also, throughout the series, Katniss seems to have extreme difficulty putting two and two together. And when she does put it together, she's usually way off track. And I'm not just talking about her inability to see how both Peeta and Gale feel about her, but when it comes to very clear statements that are made to her. For example, when Boggs warns her about trusting certain people, she just brushes what he says aside and goes about her business. I don't know about you, but when someone I trust says something very clear like that to me, I mull it over in my mind right away. Katniss seems to have difficulty grasping some basic things and it's not until a long time after what was said comes back to her mind and oh, now, she finally understands what they meant.<br /><br />And don't get me started about how she treats Peeta. Don't get me wrong, I know Katniss had a very difficult life and seeing her mother lose it after her father died because she loved him so deeply probably had Katniss scared to ever love someone romantically that way for fear of what would happen if she lost him. But, my goodness! After what Peeta went through and knowing he had been altered and was not in his right mind, she abandoned him so quickly. Her attitude of oh well, Peeta's never going to be the same I guess I'll just let him go really started to get on my nerves. So much so that I almost didn't finish reading the book! Even after Haymitch tries to knock some sense into her she still doesn't care for Peeta the way she should. Even though they end up together at the end it's not very satisfying, for me anyway. Peeta just deserved better.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Amazing book. The unique style of writing pulls the reader into the story, which is written as letters from a troubled 15-yr-old boy to his \\"friend\\" ... you quickly become that friend. Because you are technically \\"in\\" the story with him, you feel his emotions and share his pain and happiness.
0760335540|5.0|Bought this from the UK and it was still cheaper to buy it new from amazon(america).The book is excellent and will be used to save a lot of money over my ownership of my first porsche.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love this!!! Best Angry Birds I ever played.  The whole family loves to play it. I cannot get my Kindle back from them when they start playing.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|I love the Gremlins! It's a classic movie that i wanted my kid to watch. That's why i ordered it.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|This was my favorite book when I was a kid and now it is my son's favorite book as well!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I loved the second book in this series & hated the third one. Day has some serious writer's block.  She repeated herself continually.  This book had none of the surprise factor or story line that the last one had.  It was just sex & nothing else.
B0040FTKNY|5.0|Much better than half the crap on tv these days. I can't complain about anything with this series.......nuff said yep
0345803485|5.0|The book was sooo good, I ordered the rest of the Trilogy.  Just fair warning - this book is not for your teenager!  Definitely  x-rated.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|This book has some really good advice, mixed with Altucher's quirky sense of humor ( he is trying to be funny isn't he ).  Try it - for a limited time he's offering to refund your money or donate it to charity if you prove you read it.  I will do a full review at ZenPresence.com later this week.<br /><br />Dan @ Zen Presence
0345803493|5.0|I personally think Book Two was better than the first - (minus the sex).  Still a page turner as the first!  Does not disappoint.  (WARNING - not for teenagers.)
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I love, love, loved the first two Crossfire books. I couldn't get enough of Eva and Gideon. Day was obviously an experienced, incredible writer... And then I read Entwined and felt it could have been written by an amateur or someone else entirely. The book skipped around and made no sense at all. New characters were introduced without development or reason. It seemed as though Day just threw this book together without thinking of her fans and the story she originally started with Gideon and Eva. Personally, I think Day had our much anticipated Entwined written just as exquisitely as the others and then it was butchered into additional books instead of one last book, a bunch of nonsense was added to make more books, and there you have it! Not sure who made the decision to turn this trilogy into something else, but it was definitely a huge mistake.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|Excellent movie for family night.  I saw this in the movie theater and my sons begged me to order it...
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Updated review for the DTS:X at the end. Thanks for the comments and votes everyone; I appreciate the time you all take to read the review (I know it's a bit long).<br />Review for the Regular Soundtrack:<br /><br />Zimmer's \\"Man of Steel\\" soundtrack holds a variety of themes and moods in the score. The most obvious theme is the one used for the action scenes. Zimmer has many tracks on the album devoted to the action type music and most songs have at least a small section of action in them. Songs like \\"Oil Rig\\" and \\"I Will Find Him\\" are almost entirely action cues. The action music focuses on the use of drums. The drums used in the tracks are powerful and sometimes a little overwhelming with Zimmer's fearless and bold songs that could easily raise the tension in any scene just with their sound. Fortunately, each action cue is not a rehash of the theme and each song has it's own unique sound. Secondly, there are several somber or elegant pieces that evoke strong emotions. \\"Goodbye My Son\\" is a particularly powerful piece that uses an escalating string and vocal movement reaching toward a climax with a solo violin and a single female humming a tune (think \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\" with more in the background). The song is very powerful and really sets a great tone for the loss and hope for the scene. Also, \\"Krypton's Last\\" is another song with an emotional pull. The song opens with many instruments playing a sad tune but it quickly moves into a solo violin as it plays a somber theme for Krypton's last moments. It concludes with an action section that is heavy on drums and strings. The third obvious sound is the majestic theme for Superman. The most obvious of these is, \\"What Are You Going to Do When You Are Not Saving the World\\" (That's a mouthful). This song is an extended version of the song heard from the third trailer. The song opens with the piano for the first minute before jumping into a crescendo of strings and piano that builds into the majestic theme for Superman.<br />On the whole, this soundtrack offers music of all kinds. This soundtrack is much heavier of action music than most of Zimmer's scores but it is all very well done. There were very few tracks that ever felt like fillers. Every track obviously has a purpose in the film. I really enjoyed it and found it to be an excellent score; definitely the best so far this year. The Sketchbook song is interesting as well because there are several sounds that you get to hear without all of the added instruments because of it being an early version. The song is long but it feels like a string of songs, which are all worth listening to.<br /><br />Standout Tracks:<br />Look to the Stars<br />Goodbye My Son<br />Krypton's Last<br />Terraforming<br />This Is Clark Kent<br />What Are You Going to Do When You Are Not Saving the World?<br /><br />Regular Soundtrack: 4.8<br /><br />Deluxe Soundtrack: (Review of just the songs that are exclusive to the Deluxe Version)<br /><br />The Deluxe Soundtrack is good but not as good as the standard one. There are several tracks that are good but there are only one or two that are great in my opinion. \\"General Zod and \\"Arcade\\" are both great songs, \\"General Zod\\" is very action heavy and \\"Arcade\\" is a good action cue that has a darker feel to it, as if there is a tougher, darker battle going on then normal. The strings are tense and the brass blares notes throughout, continuing to add onto itself, making what is tense get tenser. It then moves into heavy drums and brass blast before moving back into the tense strings; it's a bit heavy handed, but still a very well written piece. Also,  \\"Are You Listening, Clark?\\" is a good song and a little quieter then the other songs. The song opens with ominous sounds that sound like people squealing, wailing, and talking. It then moves into the soft piano theme for Clark Kent. The voices are very creepy and mysterious but the piano gives a redemptive, uplifting ending that wipes the \\"scary\\" sounds away. The exclusive songs are mainly darker and mysterious but there are a few songs that are quite good, even though they are not exceptional.<br />I really liked the packaging for this soundtrack. The steel case looks really cool and the raised metal symbol is an excellent addition. There is a sheet that is stuck to the back with some sticky things that can be peeled off with ease without hurting the soundtrack or the paper. I have not yet tried the DTS download but I look forward to trying it. I will update the review when I have had some time to listen to it.<br />Overall, the deluxe edition has some good additions to the score but the first disc is still the best. However, that is not a reason not to get the deluxe which definitely has some tracks worth buying. The sound is a little different on these tracks but the songs are still quite good from time to time.<br /><br />Standout Tracks:<br />You Led Us Here<br />This Is Madness! (Interesting Drum Piece)<br />Arcade<br /><br />Deluxe Tracks: 4.45<br /><br />Overall Deluxe Soundtrack: 4.7<br /><br />DTS:X App and Music:<br /><br />I have had the Z+ app for over a week now and have been playing around with it on my ipod touch 4th generation. The app itself is a bit frustrating right now because I have had to re-download several of the tracks several times when I reopen the app. The songs can take a while to download, depending on the connection speed (2 to 3 minutes per song at a local restaurant and 30 seconds at the local college I attend). On a more positive note, there has already been an app update and they have been working on the problems so they are dedicated to fixing the problems with it.<br />Now, I listened to the music itself with two separate headphones. I used my apple headphones that came with my old iPod 4 and a cheap pair of in-ear headphones my wife uses that normally have better sound quality and loudness. The songs do sound very different with the headphones; some instruments sound off in only one ear and the bass is much stronger in both headphones, which made it feel like a much better set of headphones.  The sound was good and I thought that it really added to the music to hear it this way. The app gives you a choice as to what is plugged into the headphone jack (in ear, on ear, over ear, and stereo) which probably make a difference in each kind but the app recommends headphones. The in-ear headphones my wife uses were a little bit better in relation to sound but part of that may be that they tend to drown out external noise because of how far in the ears they go. Both sets of headphones sounded very good and pronounced. The difference between that and my car stereo and phillips brand home stereo was substantial because it really felt more real with the sound coming from seemingly different places. I recommend the download as long as the app is further updated to fix bugs and you have a decent set of headphones. The apple headphones worked, but I got the impression that over ear and higher quality in ear headphones would sound better. The music in 11.1 headphone surround was definitely interesting, unique, and fun. For those on the fence between the regular and deluxe soundtrack, if you enjoy better sound from music, the deluxe is worth it just for DTS download. Also, the update offers a free bonus song if you sign up for the newsletter. One of the bugs in the app prevents me from finding out what the song is, but just downloading the app would allow for people to listen to \\"Ignition\\" and the bonus song for free without a code.<br /><br />Z+ app: 4.1 stars (will adjust if further app updates are made)<br />DTS Music: 4.8 stars<br />Overall: 4.5 starslusive songs are mainly darker and mysterious but there are a few songs that are quite good, even though they are not exceptional.<br />I really liked the packaging for this soundtrack.

B00CY1JUW2|5.0|I have been listening to this album non stop and easily my favorite album from them since Songs for the Deaf
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Based on a James Lee Burke novel, this is a wonderfully layered story by a master storyteller. And Tommy Lee Jones never made a bad movie. The only problem with it was a big one for me -- no subtitles. Maybe one of these days, Amazon will get with the program and provide them for those of us who have trouble hearing. But that has nothing to do with the quality of this movie, which is definitely 4 Stars. I highly recommend it.
B003ZK50SY|4.0|funny and funnier!  I love this guy's writing.  Anything that makes me laugh out loud on a regular basis definitely gets my appreciation. All you have to do is read just one of Sedaris' books and you're hooked.
B0091REZMW|1.0|Used it once and removed it from my device.  Don't waste your time.  I know there are others who just love this.  They can have it.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|First things first... We all know that they waited 4 years too long to release this \\"Into Darkness\\" feature.  Kahn is the s***, even though he's a total prick and super crazy angry.  He's the kind of guy hott girls fall in love with.  Captain Kirk went soft.  Spock looks TERRIBLE and well, let's face it... a bit chunky.  Sorry Zachary Quinto, you definitely should have worked out for this second flick.  I don't ever remember Spock being overweight.<br /><br />  The action in this movie is some of the best I have ever seen.  I put this in the top five up there with Avatar.  Though we all know that Avatar cannot and will NOT EVER be beaten, unless it's by it's own sequel.  :-)<br /><br />  I am not real big into going into huge detail.  The colors were amazing, I felt like I was actually there in almost every scene, which tells you a little bit about how great the graphics are.  I was pretty disappointed in the lack of story towards the end of the movie... however, that will not keep me from watching this movie over 100 times.  I watched Star Trek twice a day, 5 days a week, for 4 months = 160 times.  YES, I'm a nerd.<br /><br />  Live Long & Prosper!
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|Somewhat cumbersome, but it's good to jot things down when I'm not near a pen and paper.  I use it to jot down ideas for new songs and music I want to learn too.  I have only begun to explore the uses for this app.
B008602KQI|5.0|A well prepared movie, and very interesting plot. Can't wait till the release of the next movie. I would definetly would recommend this movie to anyone.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I have read all of Nalini Singh's PSY/CHANGELING novels and each of them were wonderful. HEART OF OBSIDIAN is one of the best novels I have ever read. It will be the novel that I compare all others to.<br /><br />I am not going to tell you who the main characters are, nor what the story is about. I am afraid I would give away too much of the story. I don't want to be the one to spoil it for everyone else. One thing I will say is to read all of the other novels, in this series, before you read this one. While this book could be considered a standalone, I don't. Too much of the backstory will have very little meaning, if you read it first. Many of the prior lead characters makes cameo appearances. Do yourself a big favor, buy the whole series and settle in for some of the best reading you will ever do. ENJOY!!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Glad I installed this on my Kindle Fire. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have a better visual battery charge.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|WITHOUT QUESTION THE BEST SEASON THEY MADE. I LIKE THE WORK OF TORRI HIGGINSON , GIVES THE SHOW THAT BIT OF CLASS, THAT THE OTHER STARGATE SHOWS LACKED.
B007GE2H3G|4.0|I really liked this movie.  Super animation and a plot that leads to a good old time adventure.  Maybe not one of the all time great movies, but it is a very enjoyable and very watchable film.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love that the show brings the true meaning of &#34;family&#34; back to ABC.  Adventure, romance, true love and family are at the heart of the show.  That and beloved fairy tale characters out of their world and in ours makes for great story telling.
B001NA2NM4|5.0|If there ever was a &#34;cult classic&#34; this is it.  There are certain movies like Casablanca, and Citizen Kane that everyone should see at least once in their life just to be considered &#34;movie literate.&#34;  This is one of those movies.  Even the popular tv show Big Bang Theory used the &#34;one of us&#34; chant from Freaks.  It's just assumed that the audience is familiar with this movie and will understand the reference.  Any geek worth their salt can idendtify with Freaks.  After all, aren't we all freaks in our own way?.
B005J2UM9S|5.0|The ratings here at amazon.com are actually about right for this film.  I think it is very underrated in general.  This film has a very slow start but do yourself a favor and keep with it because it gathers steam very nicely and as it approaches the end gets really nuts.  I loved it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|The best bingo game I have found! I play constantly on Droid Razor MAXX and Kindle Fire. Best on Kindle Fire because of the larger screen but it's fun on both!
B0050DIWFC|2.0|Just went on and on with too much information and then had a terrible ending.  Not at all what I was expecting after reading the reviews before I purchased.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Super happy with the new update! u can now spawn animals in creative and carry water and lava! Plus there is cake :) Always love minecraft but this is so much better!
B003U6BE8I|4.0|I rented this movie when I was watching some pre-teen boys. They requested it, and it was pretty cheap for a rental so I let them get it. I didn't expect that I would enjoy it as much as I did! There were some concerns I had over they mythical story, but since I watched with them I was able to have conversations about what was real and what wasn't real.
B000000OTU|5.0|A MUST have for an Aerosmith fan.  Great tunes from beginning to the end.  Brings back great memories of High School.  You won't be disappointed owning this CD.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|WOW!, you would never know that the Sab's (sans Bill) were dormant for all those years. Ozzy's voice is clear and consistent, Tony's & Geezer's guitar playing is spot on. Their sound is still foreboding and powerful...can't wait 2C them live!<br />I would love to hear this version of the band re-record Vol. 4 in this clear, wonderful sound.
159463176X|3.0|I loved his first two books and the start of the this book but I soon lost interest because the story was jumping timelines waaay too much and a lot of fluff.  Nothing pulled me in emotionally like the the first two.  I was soon just wanting the story to be over.
B005DN7W4G|2.0|This movie sucks. Doesn't compare to Knowing with Nicolas Cage. Will never again rent this movie. Not worth my money or time. Not even my kids enjoyed it.
B005TBN3EU|3.0|Summary says it all.  Don't expect much that's new, everything is a clone of the first show, but set in Thailand.
B001EBWITA|1.0|This flick begins well, but then becomes one of the worst movies anyone can watch. It not only dragged at times, but the acting is sub-par and the plot stinks.
B007AYKZBI|5.0|Alison Balsom is, on all counts, one of the very finest trumpet players in the world. End of that story.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|Geezer Butler said in an interview with BassPlayer Magazine, Rick Rubin kept Ozzy singing in the appropriate register so that the album could be replicated in a live music setting if/when Black Sabbath decided to tour. That was technically a smart decision, however it put a little bit of a restriction on this album. So it boils down to this... Ozzy is NOT the same Ozzy as he was back in the 70's when the first run of Sabbath albums were being recorded. Ozzy is almost 65 years old now, of course this is not going to sound exactly like Sabbath Bloody Sabbath did, so perhaps we can rate this album accordingly? Yes, the goal was for this album to sound similar to the original albums, but No, that shouldn't mean that because it's not exact, that it \\"sucks.\\" I for one was amazed by the quality of Ozzy's voice as compared to his last two solo albums. Maybe it was a good thing to keep him singing within proper range. The songs were very typical of classic Sabbath, with bluesy breaks and dark haunting riffs and lyrics. My favorite songs are Zeitgeist, Loner, and Pariah. The solos are very fresh, the songs themselves do fade into eachother without much differentiation, but I believe that overall this was a great album. Heck, I have to assume that all of us who have already started reviewing it have only listened to it 1 or 2 times through. Let's give it chance for crying out loud. Ozzy has always had a way of growing on his audiences.
B002CAWNEM|5.0|My best friend love love this movies and she told me to buy it because I would like it and she was right I loved it
B0084B5TK8|3.0|I guess dracula wasnt as exciting as i remember so aften tedious reading in parts, but this is a classic i feel bad if i criticise it too much.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|My best friend love love this movies and she told me to buy it because I would like it and she was right I loved it
B008NF45S2|1.0|Could not find support, nor a forum for aid with reinstalling or redownloading without paying again. Should have read comments by previous purchasers before paying.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|My best friend love love this movies and she told me to buy it because I would like it and she was right I loved it
B00632HWOG|3.0|I must have missed something on install, either only handles Yahoo mail or I didn't see how to add mail from other sources.
B00001ZWTT|5.0|My best friend love love this movies and she told me to buy it because I would like it and she was right I loved it
B004JK61K0|4.0|Works well as IMAP client. Would be five stars if it would remember settings between print jobs. That is about only shortcoming I have experienced.
B000IZ21BS|4.0|Haven't seen this for a while but no matter how many times i've seen it I still enjoy watching it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really liked this book recommended by a friend and along similar reading type of 50 shades as well.  This is a little more watered down :)
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|Glitches every now and then but it's a great game and its very fun. I would recommend it to anyone invested in grand theft auto
B00C061HZY|5.0|For me, This is THE Album of 2013. The musical knowledge that Daft Punk has gained over the years is amazing, and evident in this album.
B00A7W29BE|4.0|App works well, crop feature is easy to use as is the document feature. Those receiving the scan have no problem opening or printing.
0316224588|5.0|Detective Inspector John Rebus has returned from a lengthy sabbatical, just in time to take up a baffling missing person's case in the misty hollows of the Scottish Highlands just outside of Iverness. Not everyone in CID is glad to see him back because they remember all to well that Rebus is his own boss and does not suffer fools gladly. While he takes on a cold case of a woman who has gone missing for years, his detective's nose takes in another ominous direction. While querying people about what they recall about this young woman's whereabouts, Rebus is about to discover that life can become dangerously complicated in a hurry, especially when one drives along A9 into the mysterious haunts of an uninviting copse land in search of clues to the remains of the dead. I liked this novel because once again Rankin portrays his hero as someone who is not afraid to be offside when searching for the truth wherever it takes him. When reading Rankin, whether it be the first time or one of many times, be prepared for some very curious procedural innovations that show Rebus at his best when getting the bad guys to do his dirty work. His keen sense tells him that there has to be a reason why more and more women are going missing and the answer probably lies within the local constabulary dating back a few years. Of course, he will have help but it is often the variety that only gets in the way of taking risks and getting results regardless of protocol. In the end, Rebus, as the canny old detective, wins out because he patiently and tirelessly lets the evidence take him where it must.
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|A chance meeting after a number of years brings the two characters back together to continue a talking relationship.  They make it seem so relaxed and yet fraught with tension and hope.  The ending leaves the viewer wondering and the temptation to supply the next scene.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|When I first started reading this book I found it difficult to follow because of the fact that it was written in a five year olds words. Once I started to get to know Jack then it started becoming easier to read. It became so easy to read that I had a hard time putting it down. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read things that really touch your heart, that can make you laugh and make you cry.
B001NA6096|4.0|A charming movie with brilliant dialogue and very attractive people.  They seem so realistic and natural-not like they are acting.<br />Deceptively simple.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|I hope that Roberts family enjoyed this as much as I did.  Mr. Sanderson did a fine job of tying it all together.
B005LAIHGI|3.0|I am by no means a person who does not like crude humor but this comedy made me hit my fast forward button more then once. at times the vulger sense of humor was not funny but instead made me start to do something else untill the next part of the movie started.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Totally cool. If u like temple run u will LOVE subway surfers.<br />It's funky, fresh, and exciting!!! It's also VERY addicting!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Overall a great book. Moves along while keeping you interested.  Wasn't a fan of the ending, but I would still recommended it.
B00ANVX6DY|4.0|I was really pleased with the overall concept of Disney junior. Although i love the other Disney classic. This is one if you have little ones where u don't have to do too much explanation about why Bambi's mother  dies, or a scary uncle Scar, or hear your 4 years-old that she wants to get married, after watching Beauty and the beast. Movie is short in duration, and teaching positive family values. And easy watch for both parents.
B000SW4DV2|5.0|Our son has been so fascinated with Robots, we decided to surprise him with this film which he loved. We enjoyed the outline as much as he took more notice on the different robots for building purposes...
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Brunon Mars is one of the most soulful singers anyone can hear of. Not only that, he's charming and passionate and it shows in his music, on stage, and in his persona. I regret not purchasing tickets to his \\"Moonshine Jungle\\" tour. Seriously, buy this album. Also buy his \\"Doo-wops and hooligans\\" album if you haven't.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Adding to our exposure of Robot world! We found a used sticker book of Wall-E. Our son began to put his creative mind at work and started to build a homemade Wall-E. Certainly as we knew he would, our son was so thrilled watching the characters coming to life right before his eyes!!! We had seen it with family when it came out at the cinema and we knew our son would enjoy it. Now that it is made available on line is wonderful. No need to clutter bookcase with more DVD, It is wonderful to have access on line when needed.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Never watched Star Trek growing up, only started watching after college. I've not only enjoyed the logical exercises and puzzles Kirk and Spock play on a episode-by-episode basis, but I love the old-era music and (outdated yet timeless) visual aesthetics, and surprisingly, I've learned not a small bit from watching William Shatner as Kirk about leadership, character, and charisma, qualities that inspire me in my own profession! hah!
B000X2H8G4|5.0|Used for residents in long term care and it works great.  Stronger than others we've tried and only uses 1 battery.
B0089LOG02|5.0|A fantastic book that keeps you wrapped up in both character's lives. Could not stop reading it and enjoyed it!
B001P3SA94|5.0|I bought this DVD for my husband just because he did't have in his archive.  It was just the he wanted.  Thanks Amazon.
B001TCHDPS|3.0|Good music and lyrics but the sound quality is less than excellent. Pretty disappointed with the quality of the work.
0425263924|4.0|was disappointed to find out there will at least be one more book and it hadn't even been titles yet.
B00BY8DIT2|4.0|Really like the combination of these two artists. Glad I bought the album. I have nothing more to add to this review.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I love this version of Sherlock Holmes.  Jonny does an excellent job with this character and I equally love Lucy portrayal of<br />Watson.  I also appreciate her credentials as a doctor.  Their chemistry together is exciting to watch.  I am looking forward to the next season.
B00COGXGNQ|2.0|Ok so this is my first time reading a book then watching the film. I know understand what people mean! This movie was garbage compared to the book! Maybe if i never read the book i would have appreciated the movie more but hey we will never know! I definitely would not watch it again though.<br /><br />I suggest you read the book! if you even liked the movie (wow) i would definitely suggest you read the book cuz you will probably go ape ish over it! lol.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This game is pretty good and mostly realistic, but the ads are TERRIBLE.  Overall though I enjoy the game.  I like that it is realistic with the energy and care of the animal.
B002XXNSF6|4.0|Beginning with two strangers on a train, this delightful movie follows them into Vienna as they get to know each other. The conversations are enrapturing, and it's easy to see why they quickly begin to fall in love.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|I have read the reviews with pleasure. There is not much I have to add, but there seems to be an element to Underwood's character played by Spacey that has not been touched upon.  I will mention it here, as my contribution to the building discussion. I think that Spacey is playing a strong Strom Thurmond.  There are parallels to Thurmond's life in the show, such as his childless marriage, his folksy charm and sabre wit, his ability to manipulate both parties, and his state of origin.<br /><br />Spacey's Underwood seems to burn with the same light and fire that propelled the segregationist Senator through two parties and several decades of service to a lost cause, making him a shark-like underdog that always comes out on top but never quite makes it as leader of the pack.  Seen through this angle, some of the elements that may seem like cliche's, such as him killing the dog, emerge as realistic aspects of a very complicated and powerful man.  Killing that dog, calming the crazed protestor, and his chilling understanding of \\"my people\\" as he calls the citizens of Gaffney, take on added meaning,  if you see Strom Thurmond's thumb print on the politics.<br /><br />Thurmond was a Machiavel, just like Underwood, but there is more to him than that. He seems to champion some ill defined cause, there seems to be an underlying element of good intentions somewhere, that is seriously misguided.  I think Thurmond's psychology is played out in the series in a very interesting way, with depth I have not seen since reading \\"All the King's Men.\\"<br /><br />I enjoy the series, and recommend it highly.
B001NLL93W|5.0|This book is just like the two before, totally  amazing and wanting more. This is not the first time I have read this and definitely won't be the last! Again wonderful job Cassandra Clare!!! :)
B0009ZHJ7S|5.0|Great price, I have ordered this for my grandson for Christmas.  You can beat an early bird special!  Love It
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. The excitement of what was coming next. Wondering if Megan and Connor were actually going to make it this time. Wondering if she was going to be pregnant by the end and who the daddy would be. Connor or the sperm bank? Great surprise ending that i loved!
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Great price, I have ordered this for my grandson for Christmas.  You can beat an early bird special!  Love it!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I think this is a fun game.Glad it's free! It's very worth time!Recommend to people who like to build.Love it! :) works great!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I chose this one because of price<br />Waited for the right price on it I like that the movie came quickly and in good shape and in the original packaging<br />I would recommend to any one who is looking for this movie and wants the product to match description..
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really like this game and you have to really have some skill  and i would recommend this to anyone who likes fun games :)
B000JMKQX0|5.0|A really well written book that really gives you some insight on what might happen if a zombie epidemic actually broke out.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book for anyone who is a fan of zombies!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Some reviews say they hae problems with freezing and glitches...i havent run into that at all..i play everyday and of all the bingo games i have..this is by far my favorite!
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|Cruise was not the right person for this role.  Timothy Olyphant (from Justified) or Jason Stratham would have been much better.  The twists and surprises were neither.  There seemed to be a lot of overacting.
0756405890|2.0|I'm looking at an Amazon rating of 4.5 stars for a book WITH NO ENDING and erroneously marketed as adult fantasy, and I have to wonder, like others here, if the fix is in.  This is a YA novel pure and simple. More than anything else it reminds me of the old Piers Anthony Xanth novels I read in grade school. Most of the dialog, for example, is tear-your-hair-out juvenile.  Yet grown  people keep walking around raving about it, and constantly RECOMMENDING IT TO ME because...I liked A Song of Ice and Fire?  Seriously guys?  I can only theorize that a lot of adults just needed an excuse to read some YA material, and Rothfuss scored big time on this miss-categorization.  But if you're going to read YA stuff, bite the bullet and browse that category for the actual good stuff there. Go ahead there's not shame in it! Some great stuff in the YA section. Joseph Delaney or Brandon Mull would be a fine place to start, with far better content than what this series has to offer.
B004SD5GZ4|2.0|I have always loved Adobe Reader, but not on my phone or tablet. It ticks me off, kind of. I can upload it to the cloud, change how I view a doc, edit it, share it or Google Cloud Print but not to my local printer. I ended up getting PrinterShare instead. So long, Adobe Reader! I don't need you anymore!!
B00AS1Q8FW|1.0|I am not a fan of Tom Cruise, but reviews swayed me to purchase this movie.<br />I wish I hadn't.<br />Cruise is devoid of personality, and simply doesn't have the acting chops to overcome his physical disadvantages of playing Jack Reacher.<br />If you are going to make a Jack Reacher movie, go with an actor with presence, like Hugh Jackman, or Gerard Butler, someone who can convey the menace that Reacher is supposed to exude. The young Clint Eastwood, or Connery would have been perfect.<br />Casting a pink smurf just doesn't work, despite the directors best attempts.
B0050DZ8J0|2.0|I am having the hardest time using this app on my phone. It took me forever to figure out how to read my personal messages. Adding connections was a nightmare as was trying to edit my profile. About all I've found it to be good for is seeing other people's activity because I've had to go back to my laptop to do anything else.
B005544TRQ|5.0|well done and interesting stories. lots of energy between stars and supporting cast. look forward to the next season when available.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|There were some recent updates to this app that made it much more useable once I got used to the changes. For example, there are now more ways to click and dig into the forecast by week, day and hour. I like that TruPoint now follows me wherever I go where it didn't before. I like how you click on the current temp and now get the wind, visibility, humidity, dew point, sunrise/sunset and hi/lo temp info on one screen. Videos I can live without, but for those that are into them, they are on the app as well. It is also nice to be able to share the weather with a number of different other apps, including all your mail apps, your social media apps and even your cloud storage. TWC did a great job on the upgrade to this app.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|First let me say I saw a few negative reviews and IMHO they are long winded bags of gas.<br />I realize that there are no rights or wrongs regarding music enjoyment but don't forget what they say about opinions and what they are like!<br />I am not going to tell you why I feel this album is so great because that would be pretentious and different people will get different highs and lows.<br /><br />As a Sabbath fan from the early days.. (Volume 4 was just released when I was old enough to purchase it brand new.) and as an advanced guitarist and guitar pedal circuit designer all I will say it has been a long time coming for me. I am glad it is finally here. My expectations were high and I certainly was not disappointed.<br /><br />Also you need to give any good album a few listens before settling on an opinion. This should be assumed, especially when dealing with longer pieces with more complex arrangements. Awesome heart felt guitar riffs galore. I am on my 3rd listen while working today and just absolutely awesome!!!<br /><br />These are the things I love about Sabbath, if I wanted a three minute Pop song for instant pleasure I will throw on some ELO. This is not Black sabbath, nor has it ever been.<br /><br />Obviously it is a bit more polished since it was recorded in 2013 and not 1972. Excellent production, BTW.<br /><br />In summary Black Sabbath 13 delivers! Don't miss out or Shame on You!
B00992CF6W|1.0|This game is horrible now.  They had a update an update. You need a realms account its free now but in a few days you will have to pay to play multiplayer. not worth it now.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|One needs to have a safe convient place to store and use the kindle.  This does the job very well.  My only extra I would add would be a storage place for a stylist.  Many of the less expensive ones seen in stores come with a stylist and holder for it.  Just a thought for future Kindle cases.  I put a rubber band around it while I'm carrying it, to keep the stylist and any notes from fallen out, a small velco strap would also be a nice addition.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|As any die-hard SUPERNATURAL fan will probably tell you, this was not their best season. BUT, that doesn't mean it's still not a great season ans still totally worth watching. It's still the best series out there.  Just make sure you watch previuos seasons first - I highly recommend starting at the beginning.<br />SUPERNATURAL has action, drama, mystery, intrigue, comedy (though it may be a bit twisted at times), family dynamics, great lead & supporting characters, an awesome car and even romance occasionally. It seems to have everything all wrapped up in one show.<br />There is no question among those who have watched SUPERNATURAL, it is an addicting show. That is why it won a coveted place on the cover on TV GUIDE - voted by the FANS (NOT Neilson rating or some other obscure rating system) as their favorite show - beating out top shows such as NCIS, THE MENTALIST & CSI.<br />Not sure if you want to get involved in a show with such an odd theme? You'd be surprised by the variety of people who get hooked on this show. Start with SEASON 1 and go from there. If a whole season seems like too much, I highly recommend theses episodes: (for humor) WISHFUL THINKING and YELLOW FEVER / (for drama) HEART and FAITH / (for family dynamics) ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE PART ONE & TWO.<br />If you make it through all the seasons - up to and especially including this one - hold on and have faith beacuse the show redeems itself. Thanks to great writing, directong, producing, special effects and all the wonderful things that make up this SUPERNATURAL - SEASON 8 starts off a bit unsure but wraps with quite a spectacular cliff hanger - making us more then anxious for the upcoming SEASON 9 (feared by most, icluding myslef - to be the last season).<br />Whether you love, hate or indiffrernt about SEANON 8 - as I stated earlier: no show compares to SUPERNATURAL. SUPERNATURAL on its worst days is still more creative, intense and all-around better then most of the t.v. shows that pass for programmimg nowadays.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Thank you so much for making such a unique and fun game! As someone who has been playing \\"computer\\" games for over 25 years this was a breath of fresh air.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is boss has a lot better graphics then td 4 and has a bunch of cooler<br />Stuff. I strongly suggest getting this and here's a tip try to put up as many Dartling gun monkeys at a time then tap where u want them to shoot and BOOM!
B001H1UQZU|4.0|The movie was good but the method in which I watched it was not. I had to restart it 4 times throughout the movie for streaming failure. Probably will not watch a movie in this fashion again.
0770437400|4.0|I have given up trying to figure out how the zombie meme has managed to hang on for so long - now I just go with it.  I've read my share of apocalyptic fiction over the years, and WWZ definitely rises toward the top of that pile.  Sparse yet literate, informed and (strangely) well-researched, Max Brooks pulls off a great 300-page summer page-turner.  And instead of going for the easy-out \\"man is doomed\\" ending, he shows us a world transformed, but not entirely annihilated.  Good fun.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|These headphones are as you would expect.  They set the gold standard for professional quality headphones.<br /><br />I'm using them with a Roland TD-3 electronic drumset, and they sound great, fit comfortably, and stay on snugly while playing.
B00992CF6W|1.0|The people that created minecraft are very lazy! They put modes for everything for excuses and the game has no point. You just build a house and survive. The people that created minecraft don't care about upgrading the game because they are already rich and don't care about everybody complaining about updating the game.
B0077EBWVI|4.0|I thought this was a fun and enjoyable film that brought in items to capture today's teen's interest.  Some of the plot was not beliveable
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Harry Potter: The Complete 8-Film Collection. If youre a potter lover this is a great way to go. All the dvd's neatly store in one plastic container. It is not a Collectors edition.
B00992CF6W|5.0|love this game. it is totally worth $6.99. if you don't have Minecraft-Pocket Edition you have to get it right now. Great for all ages.Also great for boys and girls. Hope you love it as much as I do!
1416960953|5.0|Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide to the Fantastical World Around You offeres more details on the creatures and mythological thoguths. Its very fun.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Good tool to touch up the blades when I am away from my Sharpmaker. The preset angle is good enough for general use. Just hope it can give the option for extra-fine ceramic replacement or a third slot for extra-fine stones.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so fun. I was so glad they to finely find it on the kindle fire. I wish you could get more gems, but I understand that they have to make someway.
B00CKJ2KK2|1.0|This game f****** sucks it wont let me past the Damn name part and it pisssed me off so much I almost threw my tablet at the wall SO GAMELOFT U LOST 1 CUSTOMER AND I USED 2 LOVE U GUYS!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's real fun.Get's my mind thinking. It's nice to use for the end of the day relaxation. Over all a real good app to have.
B009YQJ322|1.0|I regrettably picked up this movie on RedBox because I thought it'd be an entertaining, enjoyable action flick - and, better yet, with Karl Urban. While I like Karl Urban, I enjoyed the first Judge Dredd (the only!) as a very entertaining, good action flick with some emotion between Sylvester Stallone and Armand Assante. So, I knew it wouldn't be as good or better, but figured there's no way it could be horrible.<br /><br />Big mistake.<br /><br />Certainly the most ridiculous part of this movie is that not once does Karl Urban never - NEVER - removes his helmet throughout the entire movie. So all you ever see is his lower face (lips/mouth, chin). That is ALL. His dialogue is perpetually monotonous and dreary, that dreadful but well-mimicked (from Sly) frown never changes, and the presence of the female costar is painfully 'acted' that it just adds to the lameness of the flick's scenario, which is no different than the mundane aspects of a cheap shooter video game.<br /><br />The gore and violence is over the top but not too surprising, afterall, looks why it's rated R. People who have been bashing the movie for its excessive gore and violence and thus giving it a 1 star need to elaborate on the other horrible aspects of the movie, otherwise most people who know what they're getting (action-wise) in the movie will simply disregard your review entirely.<br /><br />Despite some decent action scenes, the gratuitous and fastforward-worthy slow motion scenes remind me of Max Payne (but worse) and the fact that the emotionless STARRING ROLE never removes his helmet for even the slightest bit of authenticity the entire movie hinders me from giving this movie 2 stars. It truly deserves no more than that.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I read thru the 3rd book.  The main character has potential, but little attention is paid to him.  there is no clear story line for each book as tehy all run into eachother and nothing significant really happens.  ever.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I'm 14 and I wasn't really into books all that much. But then after Cassandra Clare's mortal instruments and the infernal devices I found myself sneaking around to read more. The series is SO addicting and in her second series she blew me away with her skills and writing abilities!! My tears are all over the books. I frequently found myself laughing so hard my eyes would water or I would cry during the sad parts. I became part of the book. After I read her books I dreamt I was fighting demons right alongside Clary, Jace, Tessa, Will, Jem and all the other AMAZING characters. She is the most skilled writer out there and I am SOOOOOOOO thankful to have found and read her books. She made me go from a person that had to be told to read to a person that now has to be told to stop reading. I just had to find the right author.<br />Trust me after you start, you can't stop. You will find and make time to read her books!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am currently waiting for her next books coming next march and movie this August. You won't be disappointed.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|This micro USB is just what I needed for my Kindle. Works just as I would expect and seems to be holding up just fine.
0316223239|5.0|Some of my friends found this book creepy, but I loved it.  Seeing this little world from the eyes of a 5-year-old was very poignant.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is one of the &#34;must have&#34; office essentials that you need in your back-pocket . . . easy to use, accurate and reliable.
B005544V6A|5.0|This show is awesome. I think it's both funnier and more serious than Franklin and Bash. Definitely worth checking out
B0063IH60K|4.0|Nice to be able to sneak in a quick game and feel like a champ when it celebrates your win!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Loved this book. Hilarious, Drew is a killer,love him, love him, love him.<br /><br />Couldn't put this down, has everything you need.<br /><br />Can't wait for more.
0345535421|5.0|Continues the great ASOIAF story. Would recommend to fans of the show, but would also recommend reading the the books first.
B007SOQBCM|3.0|The app does not have all the great things like on the PC, No log in, cant see if your followers are streaming and there's no chat. The app would work better if it had these key elements.
034554398X|5.0|This third book continues the great story that George R.R. Martin started in A Game of Thrones.  Would recommend reading the books first, prior to watching the show.
B00007LTIA|3.0|Love YES, but not worth the full purchase price of this CD.  Its got some usual, long progressive songs, that any diehard YES fan can appreciate, but its definitely not their best stuff.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Amazing is the word to describe this game. If only it had more suits. Anyways, this game is one of the golden games of gameloft. I love it<br /> If Amazon gave you 500 coins or 5$ .. Buy this! I did. Hey, Gameloft creators, Try to make a Man of Steel game. Make it free for a limited time. Thanks. :D
B001FBJULI|4.0|Good late 80's clubbing songs, I recall from the partying days of my 20's.  The not so popular ones are the best.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|It's better than you think it's going to be. Watch it you won't be dissatisfied. Good performance by Matthew McConaughey.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Love the book!!!  I was worried this was the last book but I seen the author note about more to come!!  I can wait for the next book in this series!!!  So you who are giving the bad reviews on her leaving us hanging,  there's still more to come!
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|All they did was talk, talk, talk. I didn't even finish the movie because I couldn't stand it anymore. Sorry but I just didn't like it.
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|Arnold still live up to his mark. This movie still delivers what is excepted in Arnold's other movies.  The storyline line is as usual as the bad guys are caught in the end but the action is great.
B001HN6EF4|5.0|These are great, they are so durable. We do not have to worry about our youngest ripping these up like all of the other cards. The clip that comes with it is not that great but the cards are worth the purchase.
B004ADF7RO|4.0|Goonies contained some foul language and some scary scenes so would not recommend for very young children. Our 12 yr. old loved it.
0061801313|5.0|So glad I purchased this! 4 books for 20$ is a steal when the books are 12+$ in the store!
B006PIXKVW|3.0|Great for kids of all ages.  A little more dark than the old Shirley Temple version, but still good for kids.
1591795230|3.0|Quite interesting. I learned alot about DNA and our misconceptions around it power, and what turns our genes on + off.  It was inspiring for me as that was what I was looking for - but some parts have more scientific backing (by that I mean, its provable) while other parts appeared to be hypotheses that the author firmly believes.  I was hoping it was more of a \\"how-to\\" unleash the power of consciousness, but it is not. It does use biology to inspire us with what may be, or is, possible.
0316666343|5.0|The pages and print are easy on the eyes, the begin with. It's a very well printed and spaced book. I feel larger books with small print can be overwhelming if you just want a light read for between chores or to settle down at night with. I don't feel bombarded with unrecognizable vocabulary- but it's still very extensive in word choice.<br />Suzy is a wonderfully well thought out and intellegent little girl (/character), living through her thoughts is such a pleasurable experience. The book slides to a nice wrap-up at the end of each chapter, making it an easy put down to get back to real life- whereas some books can seemingly leave you too nervous to stop reading and get back to responsibilities. :)
145210655X|5.0|While we don't (yet?) own the book, my hubby spotted it at our local library and checked it out. He spent the evening chuckling over it. The next day, my two sons spotted it on the coffee table and immediately set to reading it. After that, I've heard nothing but \\"Hey dad, do you remember the one where...\\" and all three of them quoting parts of the book. Right now, we've a play date with 4 boys (ages 9, 8, 7, and 6) at our house... and instead of running, screaming, and rough housing, they are all gathered around the book and reading and laughing. While I am not a Star Wars fan myself, I strongly recommend this book for all Star Wars fans of all ages!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|At first I was not sure but Ana is an awesome character. I will start on book 2 now. Very enjoyable.
0743526937|5.0|Learning how to negotiate an agreement without giving in, is an everyday issue for numerous people.  When you feel like you are giving in, most likely you are lacking good communication skills, and/or you don't have clear interpersonal boundaries that allow you to consider your real position on the matter.  Regardless of the \\"why\\" you are learning to get to \\"yes\\" without giving in, this is an important book for several reasons.  1)  There is always a power balance issue that is involved in negotiating.  2) If you lean towards feeling devalued, blaming others, or extreme self-protection, it will be challenging for you to negotiate and feel comfortable with your decision.  3) If your relational pattern is about \\"giving in\\", you most likely have a tendency to 'give your power away\\".  For these main reasons, this book is a gold-mine!  It provides a clear, comprehensive guide on how to find your own power, in a strength-based way.  This book will teach you how to avoid \\"bullying\\" the other person, and how to avoid being bullied yourself.  This is an essential skill in learning and PRACTICING how to negotiate agreements, and not give in (cede the power to the other party).  In my book: \\"Trauma and Transformation: A 12-Step Guide\\", I fully explore the spiritual side-effects of trauma, and how the 12 Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous is a powerful systematic approach for the trauma survivor seeking a spiritual solution.<br /><br />-Rivka Edery, L.M.S.W<br />Website:  [...]<br />Author of:  \\"Trauma and Transformation: A 12-Step Guide\\".<br />Available from:  [[ASIN:1482785099 TRAUMA AND TRANSFORMATION 12 Step Guide]]
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|It is really hard to read a book fall in love with it, only to be left hanging. but having to wait so long for the rest of the story, causes you to lose all emotional investment in the characters. It took me awhile to get back on board with the crazy intense love between Giddian and Eva because I was having trouble remembering their history. And now again we are left with lose ends. Like what happened to the receptionist and what is the shrink up to?  I like the story but now I'm just frustrated bowing I have to wait and that I will forget about every thing.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Much better than book 1! This book bright so many emotions and so many surprises! Only complaints is the annoyingness of America going back and forth between Maxon and Aspen and how it STILL doesn't show who is selected!!!
193700788X|2.0|I was very disappointed in this book for several reasons. In as far as the ending you know how that was going to turn out if you read the two before. I was not surprised. What was terrible was how it was done. There was no heart. No respectful conclusion at all. Sookie should have ripped the two of them a new one and left with her head high. The relationship ending was devoid of any passion or feeling. Also we didn't get enough of the secondary character resolution. This book felt rushed and you could predict every situation they were so obvious. Wait for the paperback if you want the complete series. Better yet, just but books 1-8.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|This book should have never happened. I once heard Shonda Rhimes say you can't have a series without knowing how it's going to end even before it starts......... Something like that. Sylvia  had no idea how this story  would end this would be why we are all a little upset.<br /><br />I love these two characters so I'm interested to see what happens to them. But waiting another 8 months for possibly 2 more  books is a little much.<br /><br />The introduction of all these new irrelevant characters is annoying. And why most the female characters have to be the former (scorned) sex partners of Gideon? NYC is a huge city has he slept with everyone? This book was slated as Gideons story. I wasn't feeling much of his story.<br /><br />These next books have a lot of explaining to do. Sylvia I hope you're working hard. It's time to redeem yourself. And I think you should offer 2 books for the price of 1.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Definitely worth your time to get into the Silos world created by Hugh Howey.<br />The writing is taut, well paced and consistently high level.<br />Great example of world building in an enclosed environment.<br />Howey really makes you care about the characters and why they fight for their lives and freedom.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I approached this book cautiously. Lately I read few delusional books praised to be *the best funny reading of the moment* and I was afraid it was going to reach the same shelf. But this time the label was right!<br />Tangled, is funny, laughable, even charming. I appreciated the male POV and Drew crude language.<br />A fast reading for a cheer my up moment ;)
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Very nice to have...like the big numbers too...EASY TO USE FOR OLDER FOLKS TOO. EASY TO SEE THE  NUMBERS.  WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.
B00005AFVR|5.0|I can't believe I have been indifferent to Bruce Springsteen from the Time and Newsweek covers back in the early 70's until this week.  I'm a musician and was a jazz snob for years.  I saw Bruce's performance in the Superbowl a few years back and thought, yeah this guy is pretty darn impressive.  But then all hell broke loose with our family, we had to relocate across country (like one of his songs maybe) and forgot about it.  I don't know what prompted me to look at this but WOW I am glad I did.  I am a convert at 58 years old.<br /><br />I've had this for about two weeks now and I'm just gonna say it (write it).  I own hundreds of CDs - from Miles Davis to John Coltrane to Zappa to King Crimson to The Clash etc etc.  I'm a musician and I especially love live sets.  This is flat out the most fantastic live recording I own.  Land of Hope and Dreams is the most tour-de-force thing I have ever heard.  It is just breath-taking.  The tension and release is almost unbearable and that gut wrenching, otis-redding-type of scream at the end of the piece just leaves me saying &#34;sweet Jesus&#34; and shaking my head, every time.<br /><br />TWO YEARS LATER:  This release is ALWAYS on my IPod
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Like all those endless running dreams, but with points and bonuses.  And sometimes falling off the edge is actually funny.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|I also ordered the book. The dvd was in great condition and played flawlessly. Please don't sew buttons into your eyes.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Kept me engaged for the entire book. Had to really pay attention to follow the story line. I liked the book but it was a little difficult to follow parts of it.
0380807343|5.0|I got this for my daughter, and she loves it. It showed up timely and in great (used) condition. Girl on the cover looks way scarier than in the movie.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I really thought this book would give more insight than it did, it was not at all what I'd expected and not nearly as well done as the first two, I can say that I was disappointed in the book as a whole and I am not sure I will continue reading this series!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|So far, so good.  This helped to restore my Kindle Fire.  I will be very happy if I have no more problems for over a year.  Thanks.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I wear this watch as an &#34;every-day&#34; unit.  But, I DO avoid wearing it when doing heavy work, painting or using glue.<br />I do have a narrow wrist but the fabric strap can easily be made to fit me.  I do like very much like the ability to immediately see the day and the date.
B004YXE438|4.0|Fun- like the music-  I like the fact that there are various levels of difficulty, and that when you get pieces together, they connect.
B003B02PEU|5.0|I liked the first person narrative.  The description of life in a small Mississippi town was interesting and the tales were often very funny.  The story was good, but his always are.
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|Although this season wasn't quite as shocking and suspenseful as earlier seasons, the writing is still great, and Michael C. Hall is as amazing as ever. Great show!
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|I'll try and leave out the \\"super\\" puns and keep this short. This is an amazing score. The tracks are varied, the music is crisp, it fits the movie perfectly, and it gives me chills every time I listen to it. Yes, you can draw some similarities between this and Hans' work on the Dark Knight...but that's grasping at straws. Also, while I think Williams is a fantastic composer his theme doesn't work with this movie...and this score does. Probably my favorite Zimmer score to date.
B001JIDE3M|4.0|My family and I really enjoyed this film. It was fun and light hearted and didn't take itself to seriously just an entertaining story based around the Jules Verne classic.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|The story, as others have said, requires the reader to remain more engaged with the characters than your typical &#34;read at the beach&#34; book. That said, the life depicted in &#34;The Orphan Master's Son&#34; is a life that reflects the hardships of living under a totalitarian regime. In the epilogue, the author notes that the events are largely fiction, but comprised of accounts of daily life in North Korea. Understanding this makes the book all the more consuming. I would recommend the book to anyone interested in North Korea as well as those that enjoy a story of honor and valor.
B004T5R2HQ|1.0|This app used to work great. This version can't actually save images on my Note 2. As others have said Play version is more up to date. Thanks for the abandonware Amazon.
B008X8RSTM|2.0|I purchased it because I saw it work in a friend's iPhone, just perfect.<br />For my surprise, Kindle Fire does NOT have a GPS feature!!! If I knew this, i would NOT buy a kindle fire.<br />I do NOT recommend Kindle Fire
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have read all three books!! Could not put them down. I would love it if there were more Fifty Shades books. So in love with Anna Steele and Christian's  characters. LOVE IT!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|This second was good but not as captivating as the first one.  Let's see what the third one has to offer.
B000QUUD60|5.0|I loved the whole CD.  It was wonderful as the King was.  The documentary is great I watch it again and again.
B005QBBC2S|5.0|This is a great movie, its kind of a crazy yet intriguing yet disturbing movie.  Cage and Shue played great parts
B007712XAU|5.0|I love the whole story.  Unfortunately I received 2 of the second CD for season two.  I was able to pick up where it left off and I was able to see the 3 disc through the end of season 2.  I was able to watch season three.  It is wonderful.
B000SEGQNS|4.0|There aren't a lot of 'Oh wow!' moments in this book, but there is a lot of 'straight thinking'.  The author provides clear and simple advice, with sound reasoning and good examples.  A good book to help sort out the 'crazy thinking' from the sensible thinking.  Although the example content of the book is perhaps quite dated now, the ideas and advice are timeless - keep pages simple, keep noise to a minimum and test, test and test some more!<br /><br />My favourite thing about this book is the personality of the author.  It comes through in every paragraph and every side-story, I enjoyed his writing style so much I bought his other book on DIY usability testing.  Honest and funny, time really did fly by reading it - a good starting point for usability and an example to other professionals who feel they have something to share with the software/eBusiness world
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Thank God it's not the end, loved it!!! I couldn't put my kindle down, even at work, shhhhh! Impatiently waiting
B0013TXA5Y|1.0|I just could not get in to this one.  I found it boring and very uninteresting.  I did not finish it....I rarely don't finish a book but I just could not waste any more time on it.  I read to 28% and gave up.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Loved the simplicity of the message.  That we take ourselves to seriously and that the true acceptance will come and be revealed to us upon death. And to live without fear. That is the greatest message.
1400052181|3.0|a bit too medical at times, but overall good story.  Those in the field would definitely appreciate this book.  I'd give it a three~
B00B7Y0206|4.0|Variety.... I have found many interesting subjects in many categories that were new and informative. Things like what people in other countries eat, marriage in other countries.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I thought about this book for weeks after reading it.  The author did an excellent job.  I have more respect and admoration for all service men and women, but mostly Navy SEAL's.  I'll never forget Navy SEAL &#34;Adam Brown&#34; and when I am confonted with hurdles, I'll think about him and how he put his fath in God to get him through.
B008Y73940|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie mathew maconahay was great. Great story line acting and plot twists. I can't wait to watch it again.

B008FTAAG2|5.0|I was recently turned on to this band and I loved the music from the first few beats!!! If you enjoy Paramore, Hailstorm, Skillet, etc you will really enjoy this CD.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|A downside to this game is that when you turn off your device it will act up. Other than that its great!
B00CA4S27W|4.0|As always, Blackmore's Night produces amazing music. I couldn't be happier with the sound quality or the music itself. Only, when I went to rip the cd onto my computer, everything was in Japanese! Granted, the labeling I can change. I just thought it was kinda weird. I guess it's because I pre-ordered it? I'm not sure.
B008VBYN80|4.0|Just a lot of fun! Alone disappointed with energy system and difficulty to earn diamonds.  Overall depth and game play are excellent.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I haven't bought any books yet, but it's nice to have some free books to read during down time. Page turning is quick and pages are easy to read on my HTC Amaze.
0425263924|5.0|I couldn't stop reading it! I finished the book in a day in a half. I can't wait until the next one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Totally worth $6.99. You can create anything in creative mode. In survival you have to live off the land and find and craft everything you want or need. It's not as good as the p.c. version but i play it on my kindle everywhere.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|It is really cool, but you guys need to add all the guns in world war 2. But still im glad i bought it.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Rick Rubin has made a science of resurrecting the careers of legendary bands on their last legs.  He saved Metallica's butts big time with Death Magnetic and once again works his magic on Sabbath with this, their latest- and possibly last- release.  The only thing marring this is the absence of Bill Ward due to contractual wrangling.<br /><br />From all accounts this one underwent an incredible series of metamorphoses before completion.  Ozzy didn't like the original lyrics- he and Geezer did all the writing on the earlier albums- so Geezer came back with some serious overhauls.  Black Sabbath lyrics have always been hit or miss, and the same applies here.  Not great, not bad, sometimes silly- but hey- it is what it is.<br /><br />Tony Iommi came in and found a lot of vintage amplifiers had been brought in; the reasoning being that the label thought this would help him find that early Sabbath-sounding guitar tone.  Iommi retorted that they were trying to get him to imitate his own tone and so just went with his normal equipment.  Good choice.<br /><br />One of the methods Rubin used to help them flex their muscles was having them do a jam session before tracking; not to record but to get them in the frame of mind from their glory days.  And it shows in the music- Iommi riffs sound energized, infused with passion and power while Ozzy's voice kinda drones on, with no real variations; nothing new there.  It was also Rubin's suggestion to bring in Brad Wilk of Rage Against The Machine as the drummer, also a good decision.<br /><br />Some highlights:<br />01: End of the Beginning- eight minutes of a classic slow build into them powerful, wrenching chords you know and love so well.  Nothing better to let you know the fellas are back.<br /><br />02: God is Dead?- a more rhythmic guitar and slightly off-kilter lyrics are featured on this one.  In a lot of ways it sounds like it came straight out of one of the jam sessions Rubin talked about.<br /><br />05: Age of Reason- good one!  Everyone gets a turn to shine here, as they stretch their legs on what almost feels like an interlude, with a background choral chant behind Iommi's incredible solo on the end.<br /><br />07- Damaged Soul: simply awesome!  Geezer's bass drags you along as Iommi riffs you a new one before sliding into some bluesy styling, like SRV on acid while Wilk's drumming keeps it all together.  If you don't like this one, you ain't no Sabbath fan!  @$%^ YOU!<br /><br />08- Dear Father: ever wondered what an open letter to a pedophile priest would sound like, heavy metal style?  Well, you can stop now.  One of two tracks where Ozzy's delivering of Geezer's lyrics stand out.<br /><br />09- Methademic: you'll like it more for Wilk's pounding it on the drums; Iommi doesn't really strut his stuff until the last minute or so, evoking a life in the fast line burning out instead of fading away.<br /><br />13- Pariah: the other spot where both the lyrics feel like they're actually telling you something and it all sounds like a studio jam carried over to a recording session.<br /><br />Oh, yeah- this is the one you've been waiting for!  Bill Ward's absence notwithstanding, this is the Sabbath you knew, loved and still will.od one!  Everyone gets a turn to shine here, as they stretch their legs on what almost feels like an interlude, with a background choral chant behind Iommi's incredible solo on the end.<br /><br />07- Damaged Soul: simply awesome!

B00C2U6G7C|3.0|A funny anecdote about what led to Zimmer's involvement in Man of Steel is that he was asked at a party if he was even a part of the project.  His response was misinterpreted from \\"Of course not\\" to \\"Of course\\", which led to his calling Zach Snyder to apologize, who in turn figured as long as he's got Zimmer on the line...<br /><br />Let's face it- the idea of any composer trying to do anything in the shadow of John Williams would make even the most hardy soul curl up in the fetal position.  You don't envy Zimmer's challenge here, but you're also intrigued to hear the results, and hey- someone's gotta do it, right?<br /><br />To that end, Zimmer came up with a couple of ideas.  The first, a drum orchestra- described by co-producer Peter Asher as some of the best drummers in the world playing in a space designed for a symphony using not only rock drum kits but classical and ethnic ones as well.  The group consisted of a who's who:  Sheila E, John JR Robinson, Jason Bonham, Josh Freese, Pharrell Williams, Danny Carey, Bernie Dresel, Toss Panos, Curt Bisquera, Trevor Lawrence Jr., Matt Chamberlain, Satnam Ramgotra,  Ryeland Allison, Vinnie Colaiuta and Jim Keltner.  The second was eight pedal steel guitarists to play the classical string sections.  Chas Smith, Marty Rifkin, Skip Edwards, Boo Bernstein, Peter Frieberger, Rick Schmidt, JD Maness, and John McClung all added a new, metallic component to Zimmer's score.  JunkieXL, aka Tom Holkenborg, who added a few things to Dark Knight Rises, also has quite a presence on this one.<br /><br />Speaking of Dark Knight Rises, it should come as no surprise that you'll hear it in Man of Steel.  You'll also hear Batman Begins and Dark Knight (there's a \\"World's Finest\\" joke in there somewhere).  And a few other old friends which I'll save for later.<br /><br />The main theme for Man of Steel is built on the now-classic Zimmer two-note motif, extended into an eight note measure which alternately rises and falls on the fourth and eighth notes.  Stirring and inspiring... until you realize it's exactly what James Newton Howard did for Aang in the Last Airbender movie.  And so it begins.  Clark Kent, conversely, comes to us as a few simple piano notes- more often than not isolated and alone- just as he is.<br /><br />So- how's it all work out?<br /><br />Meh.<br /><br />Disc 1:<br />01- Look To The Stars: an ambient intro starts us off and becomes background for the Man of Steel motif, with a little bit of female choral added before switching to one of those famous Remote Control Productions percussion tempos.  Seems like it's trying to invoke the same sense of wonder and discovery as William's Planet Krypton.<br /><br />02- Oil Rig: all percussion all the time, with a little keyboard bottom tossed in towards the end.<br /><br />03- Sent Here For A Reason: lots of simple tonal overlays and we get a brief tease of those lone piano notes on top of them.  Midway the Man of Steel returns and we're back to the piano before... more tonal overlays.<br /><br />04- DNA:  In interviews Zimmer stated that this track \\"celebrates all that's good in the heartland.  The epic sound of fields and farms stretching towards the horizon.\\"  Really?  Frenetic electric cello rushes over some Inception bottom, rehashed Bane motif and more RCP tempos- that's what bailing hay, milking cows and corn fields are all about?<br /><br />05- Goodbye My Son: begins with a mother's humming softly to her child, then rises to a somber farewell comprised of low and high synth, brass and female choral, including the return of the soloist.<br /><br />07- Krypton's Last:  So minimalist you'll wonder if silence wouldn't have worked better.  Nothing but a bunch of single notes until the last 30 seconds when you get the predictable flurry rush.<br /><br />08- Terraforming: Remember Mombasa- the frantic chase through the streets in Inception?  Strip down the tempo, then layer it- of course- toss in some heavily muted elephant blasts from that trailer, and then bring the layers back.  Add a dramatic pause, slip in some elephants blasts even more heavily muted and filtered... don't forget to add more layers, this time with the motif included.  Sprinkle in a dash of cello and taiko drums, and an emotional rise at the end.  Play around with that for almost ten minutes and voila!<br /><br />09- Tornado:  Zimmer reached way back with this one- lifting the ethereal intro from Gladiator's \\"Wheat\\" to start this one off.  A bit of Dark Knight Rises, and it's back to a RCP tempo.  More percussion to illustrate the action, some dramatic high strings and the return of the piano tinkling... over tonal notes.<br /><br />14- This Is Clark Kent: a faint tonal accompanies the piano, introducing us to the human side of Kal-El.  The tonal support switches to a reverb, with some faint string rushes you can just pick up at higher volumes.  As the piano measure repeats, the track introduces a new softer, percussion rhythm- again, underneath- that gets more usage in later tracks.  But alas, the drums get louder and crash in towards the end.<br /><br />16- Flight: starts with an exploration of the Man of Steel theme, first softly then rising to a crescendo before dipping down again.  Piano comes back with female humming, then the percussion returns with female choral and bass guitar.  Towards the finale as it rises all sections are present, mostly the taiko drum.<br /><br />17- What Are You Going To Do When You're Not Saving The World?: recognized from the last trailer, it's most of the key themes all together, described by everyone who's heard it as \\"the entire score in 5 minutes.\\"  But it does sound pretty good; one of the best tracks on the score.<br /><br />Disc 2:<br />01- Man Of Steel (Hans' Original Sketchbook):  This is a compilation of all the elements Zimmer used to put together the score- notes, measures, themes, variants, etc.  Meaning you've also heard it all already on the first disc.  Nice to have, but it's 28 minutes of the same stuff over and over again.  Notable here is the use of that springing synth key from Dark Knight- if you didn't know it's all a rehash before...<br /><br />02- Are You Listening, Clark?: dissonance and discord; lots of ambient and spectral noise that ends with the Clark Kent piano notes.  Well suited to demonstrate Clark's dilemma with his super-hearing and his mother's calming influence.<br /><br />05- This Is Madness!: once more, Mombasa, with feeling- this time on snares.  And yeah, it's layered- timpani and other types of drums; the ensemble in full effect.<br /><br />More than anything else Zimmer's ever done, this score can be summed up as \\"How To Cannibalize My Career.\\"  I guess the question then becomes, why is this the kind of stuff Hollywood seems to want so badly?  Remains to be seen how well it'll serve the film, but on its own it ain't much.  And a lot of it.hat trailer, and then bring the layers back.

B00C5W3SBE|5.0|I knew based on previews and all the talk surrounding Oz the Great and Powerful that the Blu-Ray would be an amazing visual experience but it definitely exceeded my already high expectations.<br /><br />I loved that the movie began in black and white because it enhanced the graphics that much more when the amazing color appears when Oz is transported to the land of Oz. You are immediately assaulted with vibrant colors, clear images and characters you couldn't even begin to imagine.<br /><br />Loosely based on the original story of the Wizard of Oz, Oz ends up in the Land of Oz after being caught in a tornado. Only there is no Dorothy in this Oz! There are many familiar characters such as the good and bad witches and the people surrounding them. I loved the creative spin on this beloved story that made many things like the yellow brook road recognize able but with it's own twisted plotline.<br /><br />James Franco was flawless in his performance and convincing as the greedy magician whose true goodness is buried deep within and may or may not appear by the end of the movie. When he is called upon to save Oz, pride and greed stop from him declining but can he follow through with his promises? Will the master of manipulation be able to use his powers for good instead of evil?<br /><br />I don't typically indulge in the bonus features of movies but for something known for it's visual experience, I made an exception. The costumes were amazing so I enjoyed watching Mila Kunis get transformed into the evil witch. It's a miracle the transformation that makeup and costumes can make. The story of the China Girl being brought to life was also fascinating and well worth watching.<br /><br />Oz the Great and Powerful is an absolute must see and definitely lives up to all the hype.

B00A9ET4MC|3.0|The book is too didactic, not sufficiently driven by character development or a good plot.. The author didn't make me care enough about her protagonists. They tend to be flat, lacking real flesh and bones, and her plot meanders predictably, instead of being propelled forward.
B002GHIPYI|4.0|Great sounding headphones and would recommend.  But, it was a little uncomfortable for me.  I do have a big head and this might be the reason.<br />PROS:  Great true sound.  Not too bassy.  Rather lightweight.  Came with a 1/4&#34; converter plug if you prefer to use that.<br />CONS:  A little tight around my ears.<br /><br />Conclusion:  These are nice headphones and a great price if you want true sound.  I have Audio Technica 40 and they are very comparable in sound.
0307720950|5.0|Another great analysis of an industry by Chris Anderson ( Wired) , This is the Internet of things - bits to atoms.  On top of his interest , Anderson has played with various parts of this ecosystem, CAD, CNC machines, 3D printers etc.  So what he has built is a book that gives a very good grounding to the rest of us on the future of manufacturing.  He is a good writer and pens a well put together book - so do not be surprised if you read this in one sitting. It is important to remember that no matter how big the Internet gets, the world of things is almost 10x its size.  I recommend this to all geeks (Along with Cory Doctorows fiction tale, Maker)  who still want to make a difference. Take it along for  your next coast to coast flight.
B006ON7XRK|5.0|I Loved This Book!!!  Being someone who has a hard time reading dull books, I truly enjoyed Lynn Truss' book.  I'm a person who learns best through examples and this book delivers.  It's also been a great reference that I use many times when I am writing.  I've also purchased multiple copies to give as gifts.  Punctuation is so important when you are writing & I for one feel it's important to pass that skill along.

B00C2U6EUG|5.0|Man of Steel by Hans Zimmer is yet another masterpiece in the long line of amazing work by the greatest movie score composer since John Williams who possibly is most famous for the \\"Superman March\\" from the landmark film from 1978. Interviews with Hans regarding him taking on the responsibilities for this score immediately show the humility and deference he has for Mr. Williams, a true legend in the composing field. Hans Zimmer knew several things when preparing for this film and that was he was not going to try and duplicate what John Williams did, but still come up with an iconic score that would pay respect and homage to quite possibly the most well-known superhero on planet Earth.<br /><br />MISSION (MORE THAN) ACCOMPLISHED.<br /><br />Zimmer continues to amaze me with his creativity. The man is an absolute GENIUS and he oozes love and respect with this score. I can't go track by track because honestly nearly every track is 4 stars or better but there are 2 main things that stand out so this review doesn't go on for 10 pages of sycophantic love:<br /><br />1 - There are 2 main overarching themes on this score and that is the beautiful piano work that is evident throughout and the BOMBASTIC non-stop drums when the piano is not in full effect. The drums are so overpowering at times it will honestly turn some people off but I LOVED it. There are also no \\"filler\\" tracks as there is a unique feel all throughout the score. Yes there are recurring themes but that is important to any movie to set a mood.<br /><br />2 - The absolute highlight of the score is 'What Are You Going to Do When You Are Not Saving the World?' as it begins with the aforementioned piano work and then slowly builds to the new Man of Steel theme and when you think it's tailing off the new Man of Steel theme repeats with even MORE power than before. THIS is the way you end a film folks!! THIS is how you grab the audience and leave them drooling for more!! THIS is how you do a score and emotionally connect with an audience like so few composers past and present are able to do!!<br /><br />Hans Zimmer I bow at your throne of composing godliness. If there truly is a Superman in the film score industry for the last 20+ years it is YOU sir.<br /><br />***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATIONonnect with an audience like so few composers past and present are able to do!!<br /><br />Hans Zimmer I bow at your throne of composing godliness.

1878424319|5.0|This is one of my favorite books for spiritual guidance. The reason for this is the sound practical advice that makes up The Four Agreements. If we silly humans would simply carry out the basic instructions of the book, we would be so much happier and so much more sane. What are these agreements we would make with ourselves?<br /><br />First: Be Impeccable With Your Word. As I understand it, this means to use language to speak the truth and don't beat yourself or others up with what you say.<br />Second: Don't Take Anything Personally. It's not all about you. None of it's about you. What people say and do that builds up others or tears them down is about that person's condition.<br />Three: Don't Make Assumptions. We all know what that can do to us. If we actually applied this, drama would be dramatically reduced, don't you think?<br />Four: Always Do Your Best. Doing your best is a way to live in the moment with the greatest possible joy or at least involvement. To do so brings fulfillment in whatever you do.<br /><br />The introduction to the book and the first chapter were more theoretical, setting the stage for the need of The Four Agreements. I didn't enjoy those parts of the book as much. The metaphor of our existence as a dream is not something I relate to so well. We certainly are less conscious than we should be or will be someday when we wake up, so to speak, but I don't see this as a literal dream. Also, the author relates our collective and individual conditions to a state of domestication. We were free beings at the beginning and were subjected to domestication so heavily that we eventually capitulated and kept ourselves domesticated. There is so much truth in this that it hurts. It was tough to confront that part of the book's message. Don't expect to enjoy the introduction and the first chapter, but don't skip them and just go to the fun parts. We can all use some waking up from whatever state we reside.<br /><br />The chapters after The Four Agreement explanations are about breaking the old agreements and creating new conditions on this planet. A lot of it comes down to love. I happen to agree completely with this point of view. I now want to share an experience I had when I was finishing the last chapter of the book. There's an exercise the author has the reader do. I was taking part in that exercise. I was waiting for our car's oil to be changed at the dealership at the time. They were playing music over their sound system. The exercise told me to open my heart and feel the love that comes from the heart. A major theme of this book and this section is to create a new \\"dream\\" for our lives. Part of the dream the author shares is having a teacher open his own chest and take out his heart while also taking a beautiful flame from his heart. The teacher then opened the dreamer's chest and put the little flame of love in the dreamer's heart. So, as I was working on this exercise, the words playing in the background music said, \\"Do you feel my heart beating...do you understand...is this burning an eternal flame...am I only dreaming?\\" A very special moment.<br /><br />I hope you will read this book. Even if you read it every year, you could benefit from the message as long as you work on perfecting the agreements.t explanations are about breaking the old agreements and creating new conditions on this planet. A lot of it comes down to love. I happen to agree completely with this point of view. I now want to share an experience I had when I was finishing the last chapter of the book. There's an exercise the author has the reader do. I was taking part in that exercise. I was waiting for our car's oil to be changed at the dealership at the time. They were playing music over their sound system. The exercise told me to open my heart and feel the love that comes from the heart.

B0083Z614S|5.0|You can't beat an old classic.  It's been  years since I read the first time.  Very refreshing, I loved it.
B005FISC52|5.0|I still havent seen the last episode. I love the cast. Hate to see it end.<br />all good things must come to an end.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I bought the set for my Mom but it has become more of a family gift. My Grandma, my aunt and myself have all borrowed it.  It is exactly as it was described and we all have enjoyed it.
B00BTHWFBK|3.0|What this album comes down to is the songs. There isn't ONE song here on this album that after it ended I was excited to hear again. I lol a bit when I see 10 paragraph reviews of this album when there is ONE Bottom-line -- are the songs memorable? The answer is NO. Who cares how it \\"sounds\\" if you don't want to listen to it? I got this a week ago, listened to it for a full day and have NO desire to listen to it again. Looks like Sabotage and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath will never be topped.<br /><br />2.5 stars
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is such a fun game to play and it Its very entertaining and it will keep you busy for hours trying to beat your own score! I only had one problem with it freezing and me having to redownload it. Other than that Its a really fun game!
B00280LYIC|5.0|If you haven't read this book what are you doing with your life? If you aren't a member of this fandom how do you survive?!<br /><br />Anyway, this book is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone I met. Rick Riordan writing is beautiful and....... why are you still even reading this you should be out buying the book or crying your eyes out over the end of Mark of Athena.<br />  Peace out be P.L.U.R.!<br />P.S. If you get the reference can we be best friends?
B000IDEORY|5.0|Dirty Dancing has been one of my most favorite movies of all time!  I've probably seen it a hundred times and still love watching it!  It proves that real love and friendship can win in the end.  A must see for everyone who loves love and great dancing.
B005K17RU0|4.0|While the app does all it says it will. But it seemed to drain the battery of my Kindle. So Im a little afraid to reload it.
B003SHUMRI|5.0|I was really surprised at how wonderful this movies was.  I've never been one for break dancing or rap, but this takes the best of those forms and intertwines them with classical dancing and ballet.  Extremely well done and a great love story.
034580404X|5.0|Got here sooner than I expected. I was so happy! Glad I got this set for such a good price, very nice too!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Amazing movie and very well done.  True life struggle through an incredibly challenging time.  This movie truly shows the love this family has for one another....they never give up hope.  Excellent!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|It is so great to have all the movies together. And this was for a really great price.  I really enjoy all these movies.
B004X75RK4|5.0|Great movie for the whole family.  Fun, very entertaining with a  different story line.  Beautiful scenery of Southeast Alaska.  A must see for everyone!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|A grate game my name is Sam and I love this game. I have this awesome world called alien land
030758836X|4.0|This book deserves its best-seller status. Its a fast paced, well written story, packed with plenty of surprises. That being said, I do have a couple of reservations abut the book. For one thing there an awful lot of repetitious riffs on relationships. For male readers this can get a little tiresome. And I've never been crazy about stories with no admirable or heroic characters. The book is very 21st century in its orientation toward the importance of media image and media reputation.<br /><br />On the other hand, the villain in this book is one of the creepiest villains in all of modern fiction and the author's observations about middle class life in the heartland of America are searing but usually right on the money. All in all, this a great read to pass the time at the beach.
B003UESJH4|5.0|good movie. brought to the nursing home, finally a story not full of sex and violence.  Oldsters really enjoyed it
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|This show keeps you on your toes.  Lots of turns and twists.  Not a predictable show.  Must see to believe.
B0081336FO|5.0|Benedict Cumberbatch is simply brilliant in this series.  You are sure to be on the edge of your seat. We can't wait for the next season!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is a great game.  Challenging with a good story and great hidden object screens.  Well worth buying the full version.  I hope Big Fish comes up with more like this one for the Kindle, many other hidden object games have been disappointing.
B000I8HIV8|4.0|Back to the 80's. Fun entertaining, good scenario. Never know what to expect next. very good. Whole family enjoyed it.
B00BMR4RIG|1.0|App comes with advertisements for Battery & Battery Pro. I have a weather station at Weather Underground and can't select my own station. BeWeather Pro is a much better application. Wish there was some way to get my money back...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love this game, it is very addictive, cant stop playing. I would recommend this game to all my friends. Great game
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|No film has ever been completely successful, financially or critically, in revisiting the Land of Oz--with that grand shadow of the 1939 classic still strong in our hearts. The fact that Oz The Great and Powerful has done so and become an international hit, is no small accomplishment.<br /><br />Garland's Oz is indelibly inscribed in the popular culture, one of the greatest of all films. Rather than foolishly try to replace it in our minds, or reinvent it, Oz the Great and Powerful builds on that fondness, expands the story in a remarkably skillful way and melds nicely with the other version. You can literally watch this film and the other in succession and it won't seem like a break in continuity, visually or otherwise.<br /><br />There is no feeling that anyone behind the scenes of this new film had the misguided notion to make you forget what came before. You can love this movie and also still hold the MGM one in the highest regard. This is a prequel, so you can watch the `39 film after it and they'll both fit together nicely.<br /><br />On Blu-ray, Oz the Great and Powerful glows like the Emerald City. And though is might have seemed overlong to some in theaters, it does not seem that way in the home environment. Like MGM's Oz, I think this film will become a home re-watching favorite.<br /><br />Since Oz the Great and Powerful seems to have been an big international success, the best thing is that sequels might give us more glimpses into an Oz that has usually been only in Baum's 14 books. More, more, more!<br /><br />I would love to have had an audio commentary among the bonus features, but features are still in abundance, especially on the Blu-ray.<br /><br />These bonus features are on the DVD and the Blu-ray:<br /><br />* Walt Disney and the Road to Oz<br />Original Mouseketeers Doreen Tracey and Bobby Burgess, along with historians Les Perkins, Howard Green and myself trace the story of the Disney connections with Oz from the `30s to today, particularly focusing on the film spectacular that Walt never completed: The Rainbow Road to Oz, using rare artifacts seen publicly for the first time here.<br /><br />* Bloopers<br />A good feature for parents of small children who might be frightened at the Wicked Witch, since this shows how they are all actors pretending and can act silly in costume.<br /><br />Blu-ray Exclusive Features<br /><br />* Mr. Elfman's Music Concoctions<br />Danny Elfman takes you through the process of scoring Oz the Great and Powerful, which he calls one of the best experiences of his career.<br /><br />* Mila's Metamorphosis<br />Another way to show children that the Witch is make believe and the lady playing her is really still a nice person.<br /><br />* China Girl and the Suspension of Disbelief<br />I loved the China Girl! She had a nice Rankin/Bass and Bil Baird look, and an attitude much like our little five year old cousin Lydia. Also, the China City is one of several sections in Baum's book that never made it to the big screen.<br /><br />* Before Your Very Eyes: From Kansas to Oz<br />Production Designer Robert Stromberg shows how the film is as much done in classic Hollywood style with real sets and effects in addition to green screen, and most importantly, how his enthusiasm for such Disney classics as Snow White, Alice in Wonderland, Pinocchio and Bambi infused the look of Oz the Great and Powerful.<br /><br />Other features, depending on which package you choose:<br />* Second Screen<br />Follow Finley and the magic tricks through the entire movie with select iPads.<br /><br />* Digital Copy<br />Using the enclosed code, you can add points to your Disney Movie Rewards and download a complimentary copy of the movie to your computer or smart phone.cusing on the film spectacular that Walt never completed: The Rainbow Road to Oz, using rare artifacts seen publicly for the first time here.<br /><br />* Bloopers<br />A good feature for parents of small children who might be frightened at the Wicked Witch, since this shows how they are all actors pretending and can act silly in costume.<br /><br />Blu-ray Exclusive Features<br /><br />* Mr. Elfman's Music Concoctions<br />Danny Elfman takes you through the process of scoring Oz the Great and Powerful, which he calls one of the best experiences of his career.<br /><br />* Mila's Metamorphosis<br />Another way to show children that the Witch is make believe and the lady playing her is really still a nice person.<br /><br />* China Girl and the Suspension of Disbelief<br />I loved the China Girl!

B005I735ZM|5.0|Most of these older recordings have issues with sound, but this one fairs pretty well...  This is one of the FEW Furtwangler documents of his conducting, let alone some of the voices... Highly recommend it for the Wagnerian!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I was really not interested in reading another &#34;favorite pet&#34; book. I have kids and dogs aren't kids. But this was different. Enzo told the story.  He's a great dog, but he is also a great storyteller. This book is not about the dog it is told by the dog. Enzo is witty and smart and tells the story from a perspective that is surprising and entertaining.<br /><br />I will read other books by Garth Stein.
B008J1QFLU|5.0|Once and a while in the life of music and in particular Wagnerian performance, there comes the benchmark all others are judged by. This is it for the Der Ring Des Nibelungen! I have been listening to the Solti recording since I was five years old and this remix is excellent. But whether you have this version or previous release... Either way you have invested in the greatest conducted, orchestral performance, produced and sung Ring you will EVER own! All others are just great performance... This is the one that existed in Wagner's mind.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I enjoyed the movie.  It was definitely a different twist. There were even some scarier parts.  I would recommend it
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really like this game. For example, if you want to take care of horses, then this is the right game for you.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I was shocked when I saw the rating on Amazon and all the bad reviews. Before I bought this book I peaked through some of the reviews to see why the rating was so low. I was even more shocked when I saw what the main complaint was. I don't understand why people read if they hate doing it so much. I can't STAND the whiners who moan and complain about having to read a sequel or a series. I can understand complaining about the ones where you basically buy a chapter at a time, and for almost as much as (sometimes more than) you pay for a full book. I don't tolerate that and I won't read them. But a series of well written full sized books with interesting story lines and characters that you love... You would really rather have it all crammed into one book and miss out on all the nuances that make the story great? Really??? (I'm really worked up right now.)<br />  I love that we not only get a good excuse to read the preceding ones again, and that we get more for our money that way, but I also love that we get to take our time and really dig into the story. I love that the author can unpack it and lay it out so that we really connect to the characters and we get the answers to our questions perfectly paced instead of all at once in a rush to tie everything up.<br />  In my last post I said: \\"I am a big lover of book series because when you really love the characters you don't want to say goodbye.\\" Eva and Gideon are the perfect example of this, and that is why, when I saw what all the haters were whining about, it made me ecstatic. More Ace and Angel to look forward to? More Cary, Ireland, Victor, Monica, Megumi, and Mark? I'm in heaven.<br />  I loved this book. I loved how Gideon and Eva finally trust each other. I loved his cheesy lines and how she can recite movie dialogue. How sure and confidant they are with each other at last. They still struggle a bit, of course, but they've come a long way. I can't wait to get to see more of them out in the open with their relationship. I was a little angry with Eva that she didn't tell Cary what they did on vacation (trying not to give away too much here), and there were, of course, times when I wanted to smack someone upside the head, but all in all, I thought it was wonderful. I'm so glad I have more to look forward to.<br />  Don't listen to the whiners, Sylva.<br />Copied from my blog: http://jennacalmersonbooks.blogspot.com/
B0067TQQI8|5.0|A great product to carry along to make sure I  have power to charge my Samsung Galaxy note 2 at least three times.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Not your typical Daft Punk album. Very funky, very disco, so if you don't like that stuff you might not like it. I really like this album because it puts itself in a context. It directly references the roots of house music in disco and early electronica. It also represents a call to electronic musicians to return to their live music roots. I'm pretty sure the more you listen to this album, the more you'll love it.
B004ADF7RO|4.0|I dont remember \\"s***\\" being said so many times in the movie. I remember watching this movie when I was younger.  I thought it would be i good movie to show my kids. I did not remember the statue p***s part, by the time I seen what was happening it was to late my two kids 6, 7 were laughing.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|Im not that into horror movies but my girlfriend got me watching this one. Turns out it was better than I expected. However it is still the leap of faith horror film. You just have to let your mind wander into this whole weird movie. Worth watching if you wanna see all the horrors.
B008YI91HS|4.0|Introduced this movie to my kids 6,7. scared them good just as planned. alittle slow at the beging. When they seen the dinos they were in awe.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|This book is amazing, and I wish that I had more time to write this review.  Oliver's writing is poetic and beautiful, creating a fully fleshed out world with excellent characters and a daring new concept.  In this dystopian novel, which I regret not buying sooner (I passed it up at the bookstore ten times because I had no money) Lena is looking forward to her cure to save her from love.  She narrates lyrically the aspects of her life, memories, and experiences that shape her as a vivid character.<br />This book brought up a lot of questions in my mind, and I looked forward to the sequel the moment that I finished reading.  Truly a wonderful beginning and world set up to a masterful and marvelous series.
B005F2BBLK|3.0|Animation is excellect. Story is ok. Dailog is good. Characters are good. Very entertaining. might need to watch one more time. Rental.
B008XG1X18|3.0|When on the go, I can now carry pinterest with me.  This app is useful for when sitting at the bus stop for a few minutes to be able to look at some different pins for reference later.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Having lived in that era, it was interesting to see details that were not know at the time. If you liked &#34;All the Presidents Men&#34; then you will like this film. This film is true life suspense thriller!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|One of my favorite books, Life of Pi revolves around two main themes:  What does it take within us to survive?  Is God present in our lives?<br />Pi struggles to survive on a lifeboat with a large bengal tiger, Richard Parker.  With his entire family dead and drowning in grief, Pi must choose between giving up and surviving.  This is the story of Pi's journey into himself and his learning to survive.<br />A second, more important struggle in this story is Pi's struggle between himself and his beliefs.  Where is God when all of your family has died, leaving you the sole survivor in such bleak conditions?  Does God abandon us in these times, or intervene when things begin to weigh too much for us to bear?  Is God even more present, challenging us to grow and become more faithful through these experiences?  Pi's journey is not only a journey of survival, but a journey of faith, and trusting one's path to a greater entity.<br />This book was beautiful in depiction of the struggle of a young man with nothing left to lose attempting to find his way in the vast pacific ocean and his place in the world.
1616550414|5.0|Everyone Zelda fan or not go buy this right now it's incredible!!!! The art work is out of this world and explains a lot for the people that need to link the games together in a timeline
B002WJI66C|3.0|This item seems to be something you hang up in a car rather than what was in the picture. I have to say when I opened my package and saw this I just wasn't as happy as I thought I would be. The mouth is slightly off and the teeth are bent back and I can't put them back to the way they should be.
B00C061I3K|1.0|Not at all what I expect from Daft Punk.  Not a feel good album and a vastly different style then previous albums that made me like Daft Punk.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Quite interesting and a worthy read. Coming from this doctor's experience, it's hard to deny what he has to say!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is such a fun game. I just got it today and I already love it. it is the best horse adventure game I have ever played.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|love the whole series!! every single episode draws me in more and more.and it is a great deal! Im glad I can watch this on my phone while nursing my little one.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|Waiting ten years for this and it was very disappointing.  Two and one-half hours of film, forty-five minutes of story.  I felt like I was watching a movie like Shrek.
B0034G4P80|5.0|If your not into this stuff, then who cares. This is for comic book junkies and it's great action and imagination. Love it!
0345529057|5.0|I wiggle between fantasy worlds and realistic fiction. This, however, is the most invested I've become with any fantasy. It isn't silly or whimsical. It is smart, bold, and altogether the best writing I have experienced in ages. I actually forget sometimes that there are no such thing as white walkers and the seven kingdoms. Excellent character driven plot, with even sideline and supporting characters havin their own unique history and in-depth personalities. I recommend this for anyone who craves distraction from reality.
B00992CF6W|5.0|AWESOME ADDITIVE REALLY FUN REALLY WORTH MONEY BUY IT AND JOIN THE FUN OR JUST BE A HATER GET IT ANYWAY :)
B007V2UGPE|5.0|the difficulty doesn't accelerate too quickly for the leveling system. over all I think its more then worth the download and a recommendation to a friend. ive spent a good amount of time playing it.
B004EPZ06Q|3.0|This movie is like the first one but a little short on eing a really good movie.  There were some very funny parts and some very stupid parts.  I did enjoy it and would recommend it for a decent comedy.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This seems like a simple game, but it gets harder with each new board! I find it hard to stop playing!  The object is to connect the two same-colored dots and use every square of the board without crossing another line.  As the boards get bigger, there are more dots.  And then the REAL fun begins!!
B00AQL8VU4|3.0|It needs to have a few more functions.  The ease of navigation and menu tools was just not there for me.
1616550414|5.0|This is a defiant must have for any Legend of Zelda fans out there. I'm still studying the book like a mad man and am still finding thing things I missed the 1st and 2nd time around!
B004R63MWQ|1.0|I like sci-fi and fantasy movies, but in Tron:Legacy, the storyline is just too silly and the characters ridiculous. Why do these \\"programs\\" look so human and get angry and hungry for power? Why do they fight by throwing high-energy frisbees? Why store your memories on an external disc? Nothing makes any sense.
B000AMSSAW|1.0|This DVD didn't play in my DVD player :(<br /><br />I was disappointed that I never got to watch the DVD I purchased.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|This book captivated me from the first page.  The two main characters are quirky and lovable.  Brilliantly written and extremely humorous.  Great read.
B00C9U9YLA|5.0|Just listened all the way thru listening on a nice soundcard connected to V-Moda studio headphones..<br />What an experience. This whole album had me turning left and right in shock and amusement. Turned my ears at an extremely sensitive and aware state. I soaked it all in instantly at the start of the first song.<br /><br />No let downs here. Nothing but pure rock brought to you by the best rock band alive.<br /><br />Buy Vinyl (deluxe 180 grams while you can) to really enjoy and pay your respects to your favorite artists.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Very enjoyable and a  bit different approach to the story.  Light and enjoyable reading ..and keeps you attention to the end
B00C061HZY|5.0|I cannot stress this enough: This album is perfect. Every composition is golden. So interesting to hear all analogue and acoustic instruments (no modern digital electro).<br /><br />I'll admit I expected something harder (not better), faster,(already strong).<br /><br />This is not a twist or crazy thing they are pulling off here. This is what they started doing and this is what they will continue doing.<br />So proud of the duo and all of the people involved with the creation of this album. It's perfect.
B005GFPZYK|1.0|Too much about self and too little about fellow soldiers  .....he was a great person ..maybe a little more about the purpose.
0316227706|5.0|I had gotten a glimpse of it in my grandson's house and thought my daughter would like it as a surprize gift. Both her and I were really bowled over by it, so thank you Seth Casteel for a wonderful experience and book, one to be recommended.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Its always good to see witty people take over the world, and con everyone they encounter to better themselves.  would def watch again now can i get Season 2 for free damit
B00CW665VI|4.0|Very funny in places, the style can get a little annoying at times but once you are use to it you can deal.  I think this author will just get better. Very enjoyable.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat! I didn't expect a 4th book, so that was a surprise. Glad it wasn't a quick unrealistic ending though!!!
B00881VLCE|4.0|Fun game but slow to open. Helps me pass the sleepless nights needs more puzzles. Over all I would buy it
B006M7JCC2|5.0|The book came highly recommended by a friend and I am so glad I listened to her!  This should be a must read for anyone going through a life altering event, or just a everyday event!  Life is too short not to appreciate who we are, what we are...live life fearlessly!!
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|Episodes were wonderful. Unfortunately there were numerous interruptions due to video stopping due to slow buffering. Had to wait for video to load.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Very well done and well worth the  money!!!! I can't wait for the next one! One of the best. Hidden object and mystery.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I loved it. Can't wait for the movie to come out.<br />It should be awesome! It comes out on June 21st.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Fun at first. takes a long time to move on as you get further into the game. my daughter likes to games but is a little too young to play. I'll probably give up after a while.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Well crafted, great writing, interesting story line, beautiful cinematography, and entertaining!  Love the music as well! Takes you away from it all....KB
B00CBKLO52|4.0|Just something fun to mess with. A little hard to see the planes at time but it's still big fun.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I ended up not liking either main character, hate is more like it- I prefer justice which this book did not offer!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Best show on Amazon.  Only downside is only the first season is on there, Season 2 needs to be free ASAP!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I only recently got hooked on Downton Abbey by watching season 3 on PBS so of course I had to go back an catch up on season 1 and 2,  I loved the stories and the time frame they are set in and the acting is superb! With the boring summer programs on tv I feel this is a true treasure to view.
0307341550|5.0|While parts may be disturbing, it is very well written and amazingly realistic even though it may not be typical of the daily life many lead. Her writing makes it very compelling!
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|Wow was I disappointed as I expected more from Hoffman after seeing him in &#34;Proof&#34;.  He seemed pained in this pix and that might be because his off-screen addictions had come back (and he went to rehab for them).  Same Joaquin Phoenix who walked around literally crumbled up and he called that acting I guess.  Amy Adams (local girl from Denver area made good) was impacted by her co-stars, so her performance IMO was sub-par.<br />The story line was without any surprises as the Phoenix character was a degenerative drunk with PTSD from WWII who wasn't particularly loveable or even likeable and he was searching for a meaning in life hopefully from the Hoffman character who was really as lost as he was.  Wish I'd rented Mirren/Hopkins' &#34;Hitchcock&#34; or Streisand's Guilt Trip&#34;.
B00BLRXDTQ|4.0|Real good box set.  This was the first time I saw the original Mad Max with the original voices (Everytime I've seen before it was dubbed).  Anyways, my only complaint is the lack of special features.  Mad Max had one that was cool, but The Road Warrior and Beyond the Thunderdome was bare.
074357818X|5.0|We live our entire lives on the beaten path, never daring to stray from its safe boundaries, but there is another world adjacent to the one we live in.  A mere step or two to the left or right of our everyday existence will carry us into a place where the usual rules do not apply; a place where things do not always make sense and where the terrors of the night have teeth.<br /><br />Trisha McFarland was a pretty typical nine-year-old when she inadvertently entered that other world.  On a hike through the Maine woods with her family, Trisha stepped off the path, only for a moment, but that one moment was all it took.  Trisha forgot, as so many of us do, that there are still places in this world where there are no telephones, no paved roads, no grownups to help us out of our jams.<br /><br />Trisha is a trooper, though, she never gives up.  Her instincts tell her to keep moving; this is not where she wants to be, so she must find a way out.  So that's what she does, as one day fades into another, and another, she keeps moving, keeps trying.  A couple of times, Trisha hears and sees search helicopters, off in the distance.  She knows they are looking for her, but the searchers would be dumbfounded to know that Trisha is already nearly thirty miles away.<br /><br />Trisha's only link with the world she left behind, is her walkman radio.  When the terror of her situation begins to overwhelm her, she finds some small comfort in listening to her favorite baseball player, and current heart-throb, Tom Gordon of the Boston Red Sox.  As the days pass, she thinks more and more of the way Tom Gordon points up to the sky each time he wins a game.  What is he pointing at, and why?  These questions are the mere beginning of what becomes a spiritual awakening in Trisha's young mind.<br /><br />Trisha is lost in the woods of Maine for seven days before finally stumbling upon a road.  Not even a road, really, but a mere suggestion of what used to be a road.  It is a glimmer of hope.  For seven days she has lived on nuts and berries and muddy water.  For seven nights she has slept out in the cold with nothing but pine boughs for a cover.  Trisha is sick and weak and hungry.  The road may finally lead her out of the woods.  All that is left for her to do is make a simple decision: left or right.<br /><br />The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is fast becoming one of my favorite Stephen King audiobooks.  While not quite as moving as The Green Mile, there is a certain amount of spirituality going on here that is not entirely common in Stephen King's audiobooks.<br /><br />Stephen King can make you care about a fictional character like no other author.  No matter how many times I read The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, I still find myself cheering for Trisha McFarland.  When King points out how close she was to civilization without even knowing it, if only she had turned right instead of left, it just makes my heart sink.  His grasp of human nature is really amazing.<br /><br />Anne Heche is, of course, a well-known actress, appearing in such movies as \\"Volcano\\", \\"John Q\\", and \\"Wag the Dog.\\"  She's not a bad audiobook narrator, but she's not great either.  What she lacks in passion, she makes up for in enthusiasm.  Kind of like her acting now that I think about it.<br /><br />Even if you are not a fan of Stephen King's audiobooks, you should really give The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon a try.  King goes a little deeper with this one than he normally does.  I think you'll like it.For seven days she has lived on nuts and berries and muddy water.

B008Y7WKKO|5.0|This movie was a remake of the classic Maverick programs of the 1960's. It was great because it had many older actors playing bit parts that gave it its flavor.

B00CH87HF4|4.0|Awesome cut scenes in arcade style Rpg. No cash spenders may struggle and be slow in early stages of the game. Replaying stages will be vital to get coins and experience. Good luck and enjoy.

B005LAIIKI|5.0|This movie is awesome. I think that this is the best movie Taritino has done. and the performance from Jammie Foxx was excellent I thought that it was his best yet. And Christoph Waltz was as amazing as Jammie Foxx they had a good chemistry together. I'm not much of a Leonardo DiCaprio Fan But i'll have to say that his performance of candie was the best I've seen him do since titanic and j.edgar. this movie is action packed from start to finish. Taritino sd do more westerns. if you have n9ot seen this movie then I recommend you do
B00992CF6W|4.0|The alpha update sucks on my kindle fire I can't see the controls or the item bar and I can't move my head sometimes. PLEASE FIX
B005LAIHCM|5.0|This movie was pretty good. I thought that Jennifer Lawrence did an excellent job. and so did the guy who played Ryan. he did a good job doing a creepy person. I thought that they both had good chemistry together and that's what made the movie. I was not expect it to end the way it did. that was a good twist. I don't have anything else to say so all in all it was a good movie and if you have not seen this film I recommend you do

B008Y1YK9Y|3.0|I found MIB3 to be just OK. Josh Brolin was great and he had Tommy Lee Jones voice and mannerisms down pat. The storyline wasn't that great, though. Some people may find it difficult to follow if they don't pay attention to every detail. I had higher hopes for this movie and was disappointed.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Lots of good war, sex, and intrigue. Great costumes, scenery, and acting. Good looking guys and beautiful actresses. Although it sounds like a fantasy series, it feels more real, and will be enjoyed by men and women alike. It is rated 9.4/10 on IMDb.com with about 200,000 viewers rating it - one of the highest ratings ever. Buy it - you won't be disappointed!
B00CS65JS2|2.0|For as much hype as this release garnered, this album falls flat by all accounts. Staying power is nowhere near as good as their old material and only 2 or 3 tracks near the end of this album even warrant a second listen. Do yourself a favor and check out Tesla Boy's sophomore effort that was released in May, The Universe is Made of Darkness, if you want to hear the album Daft Punk wished they released. You can thank me later. All I can hope for now is a decent remix of this album.<br /><br />Edit: to those in denial of the obvious, I can only assume that you're a devoted fanboy or your perspective on electronic music is limited, because anyone with a good amount of exposure would quickly realize that this release is a dud. On that note, I would be more than happy to make additional recommendations...
B0091REZMW|4.0|Seems to go on forever.. it's fun while new rooms are unlocked.. after a while, finding stuff becomes mechanical.. sometimes missing out on rewards due to time limits is annoying..
B009X01D9U|4.0|Nice case and meets all my needs.  I just wish I could charge it with the lid closed, but it has to lay open for the connection to be made.  I love the color and was pleased that the orange color was less expensive than the other colors...not sure why, but ok by me.
B009CGRGDC|5.0|We watched Psycho with our grandson the other night.  We wanted him to see what happened to Norman Bates in his late years in preparation for watching the new Bates Motel series.  The film was as enjoyable and captivating as we remembered it when we were his age.  Great, Great, Great!
0345308239|3.0|The March of Folly presupposes from its title that the \\"folly\\" is clear to the decision makers of the time, obvious, and avoidable. Despite the citations in this book of people who disagreed with the policies of the renaissance popes, the British in the American colonies, or the Americans in Vietnam, I remain unconvinced that \\"folly\\" is \\"ab initio\\" open, obvious, and avoidable. This books strikes me as a massive exercise in hindsight.<br /><br />There are minority viewpoints on every subject, some of which will eventually be proven right by history. History, however, is not a narrative; fortune plays the critical if not the major role. It strikes me that any ultimately \\"wrong\\" decision can be called \\"folly\\", especially when one cherry picks contrary viewpoints that preexisted that decision.<br /><br />For example, had Reagan's 1980s military buildup culminated in nuclear war with the Soviets, it would have been considered the ultimate folly... but it didn't so no one is going to write a book about it. Instead the USSR disintegrated- and of course books have been written making the causal connection between Reagan's buildup and the collapse. It seems to me that (to borrow a phrase from N.N. Taleb) the \\"generator of history is opaque\\". We will never know all the reasons that led to the breakup of Soviet Russia, but as part of our human condition we desire and create causal relationships even when we have no solid ground to do so.<br /><br />Back to the book. Aside of my critique of Tuchman's thesis- that it may be impossible to identify folly before the fact and that any wrong decision can be called folly after the fact-, I do have other minor critiques. The book seems very long (too wordy) and is not as concise as it could be. Further, there are times when Tuchman speaks to the mindset of various people without citation proving how she knows about that mindset (for example \\"X was not sure of President Johnson's war aims\\", et c.,). I would like to know more about theprimary sources she cited.

B00CA4S27W|5.0|I've been a fan of Ritchie for years, but when he first started Blackmore's Night I was very disappointed. It just wasn't my cup of tea. Over the years I learned to appreciate his new music and even became a fan.<br /><br />Over the past 16 years Ritchie and Candice have been very prolific, releasing a great deal more material than his former colleagues from Deep Purple. Of course, there is a reason for that - a lot of Blackmore's Night songs are interpretations, covers, and even the original stuff tends to be a little derivative (but that's always been Ritchie's thing). They've had some strong albums and some that I'd rather forget (the Christmas Carols one). This new album, Dancer & The Moon, I rate as highly as the very first album. It features a total of 13 songs, but much more importantly for Ritchie Blackmore fans - it has by far the most Stratocaster playing since he left Rainbow in 1997. I'll go briefly through the songs:<br /><br />I Think It's Going to Rain Today - a cover song that I've heard them play acoustically in the past. This one has an electric solo and is actually a really nice rendition. Not sure how I feel about Candice's singing, but Ritchie saves the day with his playing.<br /><br />Troika - a Russian-inspired song. It's what Ritchie and Candice call a \\"dance\\" or a \\"party\\" song. I'm not a big fan, but it's not that bad either.<br /><br />The Last Leaf - filler track. Can't even remember it right now.<br /><br />Lady In Black - the second cover in the album. Ritchie takes on the Uriah Heep classic. To be honest, I don't really like the first half of the song. Candice's singing doesn't help either. Then in the second half, Ritchie swoops in with the Strat and saves this one too.<br /><br />Minstrells in the Hall - Ritchie copies his older work. An instrumental piece that is actually pretty decent, but there is just something off about his guitar sound. Sounds a bit muffled and not as crisp as it should have been.<br /><br />The Temple of the King - a classic Rainbow song that's been given a new lease of life. While I hated what they did to Rainbow Eyes, this one is not bad! I really like Ritchie's soloing in this one.<br /><br />Dancer and the Moon - the title track of the CD is one of the more original and fresh songs on the album. Nicely written and very well played. Catchy tune.<br /><br />Galliard - another acoustic instrumental. I swear I've heard Ritchie play this before. I don't remember exactly where, but it's definitely some old BN stuff revisited.<br /><br />The Ashgrove - worst song on the album for me. Sounds like a children's song. Just not my thing.<br /><br />Somewhere Over The Sea (The Moon is Shining) - an acoustic track that features a surprising Strat solo in the middle. Fantastic song.<br /><br />The Moon is Shining (Somewhere Over The Sea) - basically the same song as the previous, but this is electric-pop. It starts with some horrendous synthesizer work. But then the song moves to a classic 80s (or even 90s) Rainbow vibe. The solo work in the end is awesome!<br /><br />The Spinner's Tale - another filler. Nothing memorable. A slow acoustic song that is supposed to exhibit Candice's lyric writing skills...I skip it.<br /><br />Carry On...Jon - Ritchie's tribute to his old friend who passed away last year - Jon Lord. It's an electric instrumental in the vibe of Son of Alerik, but a little faster. Fantastic playing from Ritchie. At first I thought he was copying Stuart Smith (great player with a great new album - Heaven & Earth. Check it out!), but the song moves on and shows typical Ritchie Blackmore guitar prowess. The song ends with a keyboard solo that reminds you of the classic Ritchie/Jon music battle that we so love and miss about Deep Purple. The way the two compliment each other. Great stuff. It even brought tears to my eyes. If you don't like Blackmore's Night stuff, but still reminisce about the good old days of Deep Purple, then do yourself a favor and at least buy this songseparately. (the only downside is the sound...it's not completely right. Sounds a bit...sterile. But still great work.)<br /><br />Overall, this is my new favorite Blackmore's Night album. Ritchie pretty much dominates it. Even to the point where you just can't wait for Candice to finish her attempts to act as a singer and hear Ritchie's solo. This album shows that the man has still got it, and even sparks hope that he may have one more full on rock album in him.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I was expecting a better story line. Yes the  sex was hot and heavy, but I feel she could have ended the story with this book.<br />She could have made th  book a little longer. It is going to interesting to see where she takes the characters next . I'm still going to read the other books when they do come out. I just hope they don't take as long.
B005HSL626|4.0|I gave it a 4 star rating because once you start playing it's hard to stop. I find it very fun and simple. What I mean by simple is that the game isn't impossible to figure out. Everything is explained. I would recommend this game to anyone. This game is a good time killer.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Love the series! I enjoy viewing the earlier Harry Potter's before they became &#34;dark&#34; But great series altogether. Definately entertaining!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really liked this story.  Inventive, real, with emotion.  Without spoiling the book, there are surprising twists throughout, that anger you and make you keep reading to find out what is . Going to happen next.  Worth much more than I paid.

B00BTHWFBK|1.0|Seriously this must be some kind of a joke that these record labels/sound engineers/producers can't get past this.<br /><br />This is an AUDIO release...so YES the AUDIO is IMPORTANT!<br /><br />What is so hard about making the cd just as dynamic as the vinyl?<br /><br />The louder and more compressed/clipped you make it, the LESS impacting and powerful it actually is....making it weak and absolute unlistenable, BRICKWALLED, clipped TRASH.<br /><br />Clipping = damaged audio signal = defective product.<br /><br />\\"Criticism of production[edit]<br /><br />13 has been criticized for having compromised sound quality, due to an overly<br />compressed dynamic range, during a process called peak limiting, which leads to<br />audible distortion (known as the loudness war).<br /><br />Jon Hadusek of Consequence of Sound said of the production, \\"Rubin...deserves<br />disparagement for the way he mixed the audio levels, which are crushed by<br />distortion and compression. Otherwise well-recorded songs are blemished, an<br />affliction all too pervasive in the modern music industry\\".[54] Ben Ratliff of<br />The New York Times also disliked the album's mastering, saying, \\"The new Black<br />Sabbath album was produced by Rick Rubin, who some believe to be a prime<br />offender in the recent history of highly compressed and loudly mastered music -<br />a major cause of ear fatigue...13 is mastered loudly, too; Mr. Iommi's guitar<br />tone planes outward, leaving very little space, and the drums stay high and<br />present in the mix. Your ears aren't given room to breathe\\".[55] \\"<br /><br />The entire reasoning behind the HD TV was to create a more detailed picture. The<br />side effect  of a more detailed picture is a picture with more<br />depth...or...DYNAMICS. A more DYNAMIC picture looks much more like a LIVE<br />picture. So while all this has been going on, the exact opposite has been<br />happening to the digital format of music. Instead of having DYNAMIC RANGE in our<br/>music to replicate the LIVE performance, we have been given increasingly<br />COMPRESSED and CLIPPED offerings...and mostly willfully accepting them with<br />complete trust in the BIG MONEY manufacturer. Even with the awareness that is<br />now prevalent, we still have mostly willful ignorance in the producer and the<br />consumer. These audio formats that have been ignorantly forced upon us are the<br />complete audio equivalent OPPOSITE of that detailed, deep, and DYNAMIC...almost<br />LIVE...picture screen. When you take dynamics out of visual, you remove DEPTH<br />PERCEPTION, which in turn makes what you see look LESS like a LIVE visual. When<br />you take dynamics out of music, you take away detail, soundstaging, attack and<br />decay, DEPTH PERCEPTION, and PUNCH...making what you hear sound LESS like a LIVE<br />performance. The visual equivalent to compressed audio is loss of DEPTH<br />PERCEPTION. Its a VERY. SIMPLE. CONCEPT. IF I TYPED IN ALL CAPS HERE, I COULDN'T<br />EMPHASIZE A DOGGONE THING, COULD I?<br /><br />Although informative and true, note how annoying the above paragraph was to read in such a \\"compressed\\" format. No room to breath. That's how this new garbage sounds.<br /><br />Thank Rick Ruin and your clan of stooges (Fidelman, Exeter, Scheps) for shooting for LOUDNESS over all other aspects of audio dynamics. When I knew your name was tied to this way back months ago, I predicted everything that just happened here with this release.<br /><br />Record labels, take your vinyl and shove it up your ace, because I'm not spending even more money to have what should already be on the cd. Going back to 70's technology is not the answer to willful ignorance in mastering cd's. Isn't it ironic that vinyl is reigning supreme again, as the digital format has been tampered into complete inferiority? That is of course unless you like your ears to bleed after 5 fatiguing minutes.<br /><br />Loud vs. Dynamic; Fatigue vs. Intrigue.iguing minutes.<br /><br />Loud vs. Dynamic; Fatigue vs. Intrigue.<br /><br />[...]

B008602KQI|3.0|I didn't like it that kids kill each other but it was a good movie , drawn out at times but an interesting story.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Went kinda fast but really went nowhere!? I'm a tiny bit disappointed... wish we had made a tiny bit of progress in the story itself...
B00CL68BK2|2.0|Way more of a chick flick then led on to believe. It had some moments but I definitely will not watch again.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|I love the fast and furious franchise and this movie had a lot of action and excitement in it. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is in to car chases, action, stunts, etc. this movie has it all.
B00D6BQG1W|3.0|It was an okay movie. I did not dislike it but then again I didnt love it. Worth my time to see though
B000Z27HLS|4.0|If you read my review of the latest version of PERSUASION, I will begin this review as I ended that one.  I bought this disc because of JJ Feild!  I must also be honest and admit that I find the character Catherine Morland to be one of the most stupidest &#34;heroines&#34; in literature.  The fact that she ends up engaged/married at the end is baffling to me.  I know that this novel was Jane Austen's contribution to the Gothic romance novels that were being published at that time, and I also know that Ms. Austen didn't particularly like Bath, so I guess she was giving the genre and the city a double slap!  So why did I buy this, and why do I give it four stars ... because I'm attempting to own each filmed/video-taped version of Ms. Austen's books.  If you are also a Jane-ite, perhaps you can borrow it from someone who owns it, or rent it, to determine if it's worth purchasing for your own collection.
B00BF123WG|4.0|This movie was very good, but did not live up to all the hype. I wouldnt buy it but I would watch again.
B00AF82WTO|4.0|Right up front I'll admit that I enjoyed the 1995 BBC/Sony Pictures version starring Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds over this 2007 re-boot.  It was eleven minutes longer, I and definitely liked the '95 version's ending over the 2007 version.  I think Ms. Austen may be doing some flips/rolls in her grave if she was aware of the &#34;liberties&#34; the scriptwriter took with the source material: how her heroine was made to run all over Bath trying to catch up with Capt. Wentworth, how the minor character Mrs. Smith was not portrayed as an invalid as she is in the book - and how she and her Nurse Rook, provided Anne with much needed information as in other versions; Anne and Frederick waltzing on the lawn outside Kellynch Hall ... come on!  But the locations, sets and costumes don't cause any complaints from me.  Yes, I agree with another reviewer who thought the actress cast as Elizabeth was a bit old, and sister Mary's portrayer conveyed just the right amount of whiney, unlovable and unpleasant characteristics that came through on the page.<br /><br />But the real reason, besides the ones I mentioned above, that I made this purchase was to see Rupert Penry-Jones - he justifies the expense!
B00881VLCE|1.0|this app was fun but kept on making my kindle crash..it took hours even days to boot it back up again...too bad..this app was pretty fun...i deleted it from my kindle..too bad.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|I really enjoy reading the Theodore Boone books. Very interesting and well written.I would highly recommend this book .I feel that John Grishim did a great job.
B001HBYH9Q|3.0|This is a simple and sweet love story. The dry British humor is really what carries the film. I find Julie Roberts character bland and not very likelable, while Hugh Grant is.....well....Hugh Grant.

B003G4W49C|5.0|If you like science fiction - you gotta have this one in your library.  I've read it about 6 times since the mid-80's when I was a young teenager.  It's very well done.
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|Unfortunately I didn't watch it until about 2 months after I purchased it because I had seen it already. When I finally got around to watch it the sound part was horrible very low at times and other times not there at all! Lessen learned !!!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I loved the first two books of the Crossfire series. This one was a disappointment. I was looking for some semblance of closure, and none was received. Now I'm left waiting for yet another book... Grr!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|My husband and I wished it were part of a set like Big Band Theory seasons 1-5, and I'm sure that it will be at some point if not already!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Funny and thought-provoking. A thrilling page-turner. I am anxiously awaiting the completion of part two. When I first purchased this novel I had assumed that it was a horror script but was pleasantly surprised after the first few pages. I think this will make an awesome book-club read.
B000005HF9|5.0|amazing jazz album by one of the greats!  Improvisation is evident and well done.  Lots of variety on this album.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is definitely a great way to pass the time.  Good graphics.  Cool way to play with friends online.  One thing Gameloft could fix though is the toutorial s.  They are not very good at explaining the game and how to play.  It is more of a &quot;figure it out yourself&quot; game.  But once you play it for a while you start to get it.  Other than that though it is a great game.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys war games.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|What do you mean it's not over. I thought the whole point of having a trilogy was to end it in three books. It was an excellent read tho

B00CS65JS2|5.0|Although it downloaded out of order...which kind of stinks for a concept album.  Pharell and Nile Rogers are genius!  I hear Alan Parson's Project, Earth Wind and Fire and many other bands from my childhood mixed into this album.  I can't stop listening to it!

The dark backdrop of a collapsing nation contrasts well with the digital Utopia of OASIS, and the characters are very human.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who loves sci fi or fantasy, but especially if you enjoy gaming as well. The future hinted at in this book is both scary and wondrous to think of.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Very Addictive. I originally downloaded subway surfer for my neice. I played it once because she asked me to and I haven't been able to put it down down ever since.
B0000UJL96|5.0|This version contains scenes that were cut in other versions that actually change the story line a but.  If you are a Trekkie, this is the one you want.  Final voyage of the star ship Enterprise under Kirk.
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|I bought this for my hubbys birthday at the end of the month.  We enjoy these movies so I know that he will enjoy this gift.
0312370849|5.0|Loves this book! Learned a piece of history I didn't know about. Liked the way author went back and forth between characters. Highly recommend it.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|I do not like horror movies but my husband and daughter love them.  They are very excited to have the Halloween movies.
B00BSWMITK|4.0|For my and my son's taste, its good plain and simple. And since I am required to say more than nine words in this comment section, just read the first sentence twice.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This is a beloved movie from a long time ago.  Haven't seen it in years and we are excited to own it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is so fun, and let's your imagination go wild! It works fine, and i have no complaints! You should totally get it!
B0001AUAU4|5.0|I took a punt by purchasing this as I wanted to listen to a little French music and broaden my horizons. I love it. What a great album. Her voice is so husky and seductive. I have no idea what she is saying as I don't speak French, but it all sounds wonderful. Its an album of soft guitars and pared down music. But it is divine.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Just about everyone I know had it, and it works fast and easy. It doesn't make you a number, instead, it lets you search period by there username! It works great and  fast. Probably the app I the most. The only thing I'd, they updated it on Google party and this some app store. So it lets you do sketches, other than that, no complaints!
B00BKRON5K|5.0|Excellent book.  Full of interesting, usefully information.  Lost 5 lbs the first week and I wasn't overweight to start.  Feel great and rarely hungry.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Didn't want to watch it due to the toture scenes, but I appreciated the cinematogaphy and and enjoyed the intense energy injected throughout the film.
0307593525|4.0|Getting both volumes for the price of one is nice. Additionally, unlike other versions, no movie pictures to sully up the work. The box is flimsy, the books are sturdy, the pages are nicely coated (for wiping off spills during the process).
0679805273|5.0|It's no secret I love this book. I got this for my daughter even though she just finished kindergarten I'm going to have her teachers write her a note of encouragement in it every year and give it to her when she graduates high school! Yay one year down. I can't wait to give it to her this book is just perfect!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I discovered a new author.  I will be reading Blake Crouch again.  I really great novel that keeps you on the edge of your recliner!
038533348X|5.0|I'm a long time Vonnegut fan, and this was my first. If you've ever been curious about getting into KVJ's work, this is a great place to start.
B001NA6096|5.0|I adore this movie. Ethan and Julie's acting held my attention and my heart the whole time. If only reality television could be so entertaining and interesting. I was thrown back to my young days when - for me - having those occasional heart to heart talks with young men were adventurous and so necessary to validate my idealistic views while hiding some major crush. Everyday was a Joni Mitchell song. This was not just some sappy love story, it was a tour de force. It was like a can opener on my heart. I truly enjoyed this movie and recommend it to be watched several times. It's amazing.
B009K86D86|5.0|It is so sad that greed is what drives our food industry, like everything else. I used to think that people who accused large businesses of caring only about money and profit were way off base and exaggerating things out of proportion. Unfortunately this film depicts conditions and relationships as they really are, not that way that one would hope or expect them to be.  The only way to drive change is to vote with your dollars.
0756688701|5.0|My son studies this book like he's preparing for an exam.  :-)  The details are great, and the illustrations are terrific!
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|I picked this up when it was the game of the day, but I easily would have spent a few dollars on it had I known I'd waste several hours playing it.  It's a little short and once you unlock everything and finish the game there aren't too many reasons to continue.  I can also see the icons being a little too small on smaller Android phones.
B00571F26Y|5.0|On day 5 of being wheat free after starting this book.  Hoping to get the rest of the family to join along!
0140544518|5.0|I like this twist on the three little piggies. It's the child version of Wicked. Ha! My son thinks pigs are evil now.
1451695195|5.0|With so many near death stories out there, this book touches the subject from a medical as well as spiritual aspect. We have gifted several copies to friends struggling with their personal faith journey.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a super amazing game. It is really fun to play. It has many different characters you can buy with coins you collect while running. I play this game all the time. I've purchased many other game's and subway surfers is by far my favorite. I'm glad I found this game and bought it off of Amazon.
B00BESM14U|4.0|Was interest on how \\"Herminie' could act.  She does a great jog in this film and I enjoyed the story line.  I am a teacher and I see so many young adults go through what these teenager did.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|If you like suspense then you'll love this.  The author had me back and forth on how I felt about Jacob.  Definitely had me constantly curious about the truth.....
B00CXN2JNS|4.0|I am a huge Megadeth Fan, with that being said I think this release is just GOOD. I like 5 songs with 3 of them being excellent - Kingmaker, Supercollider ( I have read most do not like Supercollider, but I think it is quite catchy and is haunting my thoughts, I catch myself singing it at work) and Cold Sweat also am beginning to love The Darkest Crow, very interesting song for any Metal Band to take on. the rest are mediocre at best. Turn you back starts off great, awesome speed metal RIFF, but the song / lyrics are too soft and nice for this type of RIFF in my opinion.<br />Dave get Angry again at least for the songs.
B0041KKYCY|3.0|A woman bides her time and plans a cold-blooded brutal vendetta on 4 men who had ravished her accompanied by needless violence and cruelty. A bit slow at the beginning and in between which prolongs the story. But the action scenes are savage and realistic.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|My 8 year old loved it. She already has Temple Run and had to have this after we saw the movie. Great graphics.
B0017OB12O|5.0|I've seen a lot of blu ray movies. This 4k version is the best clean looking colorful movie I've seen. If 4k looks like this on every movie I'm amazed. I find it funny Alec Guinness doesn't realize what he's doing after being in the hot box for a few days and comes out eager to help the Japanese like he's completely lost his mind those few days.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|OK...<br />Anyone wanting the Classic Black Sabbath of the 70's will not be disappointed.<br />I noticed some of the reviewers here bought the album (I pressume) with a dislike towards Ozzy & Ruben...why buy the damn thing with a bias against it?..bottom line is you'll agree with them if you hate the Artists too... DUH!<br /><br />With all the bands coming out and capitalizing on Sabbath's 70's sound it's great to have the real deal back and Ruben was perfect in acknowledging this.<br />And speaking of Ruben some here are wondering why him?<br />Since he produced some of the best albums by Danzig it was a brilliant choice imo!<br /><br />However, it IS unfortunate that Bill isn't on here and to add salt they ripped off his style.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|I've always enjoyed the story of Emma. I love the progression of the character of Emma, you witness her growing and maturing, learning to become a better person, and you get to read this all in classic Austen style!<br />Emma will always be my favorite Austen novel.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is addicting and fun! You can start out on an easy level and then skip through quickly until it gets challenging.(
B00BXU6C2Q|5.0|Exactly what one would expect from Tim Burton.  I'm an adult and bought it for me.  It's not for little kids, although 'tweens would likely enjoy it.
B005MVF65G|5.0|Very interesting movie. Robert Redford definitely is a great director. I'm not a fan of movies about history, but this one made me stay on the chair all the time.
B005723JSQ|5.0|Totally unrealistic but a great read! I found it funny lightweight and entertaining. I recommend that you read this book.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|The puzzles are intricate and fun. The art is adorable and it's good for all ages (if you're allowed on a kindle that is)
B0063IH60K|4.0|Haven't played this for years! Keeps the brain active and am enjoying it.<br />Once I get refreshed will upgrade for more challenge
6305090564|5.0|This is not a high end Si-Fi movie but it is a good one.  There are a lot of funny scenes and a lot of drama.
B00CKJTVHW|5.0|Great season!  Then again, I haven't seen a season I didn't love!  So much fun!  Sad that next season will be the last..  =(
B000HEWEDK|5.0|This movie was originally produced in the 50's in black and white. The new color reproduction is great and nothing looks odd. If you are a Si-Fi lover don't pass up getting a copy for your collection !!!  Leslie Nielsen was very young in this movie and this is also where Robby the Robot was first introduced.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|Hate the way the park has everything must be done in a certain way and that they don't accept AdultBabyDiaperLovers
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVEEEEEEE SUBWAY Surfers so much!! Everything about this game is so cool!! I love switching from one place to another!! I can be at Tokyo and then Miami I love it!!!<br /><br />I love subway surfers!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I was really looking forward to this book coming out but I expected that this would be the end of the story. The sex is great but I think I have read enough of it now. I think the story is starting to go on to long now.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|I;ve had no problems with this product and I can print from my tablet now where before I could not
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|its pretty good. thankfully its not an angry birds clone. small puzzle game, each level can take a few seconds to a minute to solve.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|HUGH HOWEY pulls you into the pages of his book. Emotions are molded by the characters as you read about their trials, fears, passions and their unbelievably controlled lives.<br /><br />A must read! A great win of good over evil
B002RTBN9O|5.0|Wow! The sparks were flying between Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal in those understated sexy scenes in &#34;The Fountainhead.&#34; I think I'll read the book now. What a great story as Gary Cooper resists selling his talent as an architect for the average guy. He knew what he wanted and held out until he found the right man who had the vision to appreciate his work. The only problem was he was in love with the man's wife. Patricia Neal is so sultry in this film that you can literally feel the passion she displays for Cooper. I had the feeling that the film may have been based on Frank Lloyd Wright. Regardless, don't miss this film. There are no blatant sex scenes as there would have been had it been made today. But you didn't need them. As in &#34;Gone With The Wind,&#34; your imagination was better than anything they could film.
B008MEM24S|1.0|I tried downloading this game multiple times. It keeps saying that there is an error. Not pleased with it at all!
0606087230|5.0|I'm a HUGE Michael Pollen fan, so I checked this book out of the library. It was so informative that I decided to buy a copy for my 9-year-old nephew, who seems to be taking an interest in healthier eating habits. I think it will be a terrific way to introduce him to the basics! The writing is superb and fun, as always, and the subject matter is extremely beneficial to helping people establish better eating habits!! Highly recommend!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|The game has you start as a noob then you build up to really epic stuff would recommend spending money though it makes it so much easier in the end.
B0019NB9A2|1.0|I have ordered this title [2] times and had to return both for the same reason. The VIDEO is great but the DTS HD 5.1 SURROUND SOUND does NOT work as ADVERTIZED. I really wanted this movie on Bluray with the DTS HD 5.1 SOUND but will have to be content with the DVD version [I have it] which has DOLBY 5.1 SURROUND SOUND!
B00B769XB8|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  The direction is unpleasant and claustraphobic.  The script is nonsensical.  The acting is wooden, and I'm being charitable.  Jeremy Renner should have his SAG card revoked for this mess.  when you watch you simply cannot believe that he was nominated for not ONE but TWO academy awards!  The much vaulted make-up is tacked on or falling off depending on the scene.  The stunts are rather unimpressive.<br />I would say that the one thing that comes across more than anything else in this travesty is how profoundly everyone involved seems completely uninvolved.  Sort of like everyone knew it was a turkey and just couldn't work up the energy to do anything well.
B001GCUNW6|4.0|Great fun series, and the ongoing saga of Scrat the squirrel is a real bonus. The rest is fun and interesting, but a bit obvious and slow.
B00B769XB8|5.0|I think this movie took exactly the right tone.  It was an action movie that made fun of itself.  It is not meant to be anything too deep and thought provoking.  It was simply a shoot em up kind of movie with magic and high tech medieval weapons.  It is, of course, based after the fairy tale.  The premise is, after Hansel and Gretel kill the witch they start hunting witches once they grow up.  The rest of the story is pretty easy to follow.  It does try to throw in a couple twists, but like I said it is not a movie that is all that deep or complicated.<br /><br />This is definitely not a movie that will appeal to everyone.  It has a lot of over the top violence and gore, bad language and sexual innuendo (along with some brief nudity).  If those things turn you off to a movie skip this altogether, because if you dislike that stuff you will hate this.  It is special effects laden, but unlike some movies I do not think that the special effects dominated.  There was enough non green screen scenes to balance it out.  It looks and sounds great on Blu Ray.  I do not have a 3D player/TV so I am not sure how that version of the movie is, but Disc 2 has the unrated version of the film as a non 3D version and the A/V quality of that was great.<br /><br />You will likely already have an idea whether a movie like this appeals to you or not.  If you are a fan of the genre, it is worth purchasing.  If you are lukewarm to movies like this, then stick with a rental.
B001OQCV6K|4.0|An enjoyable action movie if you know nothing about Sherlock. Enough fun that I bought both this and the sequel. Robert Downey seems in a class by himself for whimsical superheroes.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|if you are in the mood for a cute romance with a slightly wicked edge then this pic is for you. Grab your sweetie and cuddle.
B00821OX98|5.0|the CGI is pretty good. The aliens look fairly real, but the mechs are not believable. Noah Whiley is great in this part.
B001NYTWVA|5.0|I don't wanna ruffle feather's but as much as I like Bob Marley in my humble oppinion this Damion Marley album is better than any complete album that Bob Marley did. Dont get me wrong Bob Marley had way way way more hits. But album to album this is my fave of all the Marley discography I have heard.<br /><br />No Buyer's Remorse Here!
B00D3V5V7U|2.0|Mostly ponderous and recycled<br /><br />This makes \\"Devil You know\\" sound like The Ramones.<br /><br />Previous Ozzy-Era Sabbath always had a bit of swing and jazziness mixed in with the heavy riffing.<br /><br />What they need is a drummer with a bit of that kind of style, oh...........
B003RNU8KY|5.0|Very positive and uplifting Hip Hop.<br />Definitely a few songs here in my top 500 rotation on my iPod.<br /><br />No Buyer's Remorse Here!
B006GWO5NE|1.0|This does not fit my Kindle which is what I told your contact in Pakistan when we &#34;chatted&#34; on Saturday.  Complete waste of time.  Seems you no longer make the accessories to fit the original Kindle.  Must now buy a whole new device simply because your rechargers keep breaking and I can't get a new one anymore.  Poor, poor business decision.
B0002TJGQS|1.0|I received these batteries a while back from Amazon and I have been very dissapointed. It appears that these are old batteries as I only get a couple months use out of them - I am just using them in my car remote. Very frustrating and would not suggest you get these!!!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|For any parent this film is a nail-biter.  The dreadful scene of the enormous tsunami wave crashing onto the coast and flinging people in all directions is powerful and disturbing.  I would recommend for family viewing but there are a handful of bad words (1 F-bomb, I think--it was very quick)  There is a scene where the mother loses her sleeve and one breast is briefly viewed but not in a sexual context.  A great film for starting any number of family discussions:  what to do in an emergency or if separated from parents.  However, the death and destruction will probably be too intense for the younger crowd (under 10).  There are parts of the story that slow down a tad too much, but the overall effect is very moving.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|I laugh every time I see this movie! Have seen this movie many times and this weekend was the first with my granddaughter.<br />It one for the ages.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Just purchaced it. Not sure about the rest of the functions yet, but so far it has been very useful.
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|It's sometimes so 'Spielbergish' that you think you are watching one of his films. It's not exactly deep, but it is quite entertaining. Excellent special effects and a decent way to pass a couple of hours.
B001TH16DI|5.0|My old copies of these movies were on VHS so obviously these bluray disks are a huge improvement!  Nice compact cases with the whole set all in one place.  Next I need to order the Next Generation Movies to complete my set.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Well written, great show full of drama and intriige.. I have enjoyed watching season 1 and looking forward to watching seasons 2 & 3.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This renders me speechless. It's melodic genius as always. Just let the music do the talking. That's all you need to hear.<br />\m/
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Lana is wonderful. For some reason I pictured her as Asian when I heard her voice for the first time. Her voice is deep and a bit raspy which is truly enjoyable to listen to. Several of her songs can get a little crude and sexual, but it's not over the top. She has an overall sad emotion in the album even when the song isn't supposed to be sad.<br />Energetic music and you can dance to it. Unique songs that flow together, but do not blend.<br />Lana is a hard cookie to compare to other artists. You'll probably like that about her. She's definitely different.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|this is a great movie to add to my classic collection. Great price and fast delivery. if your a fan of old classic Disney movie then this was a great deal.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Absolutely great band! So so good! The radio has played to death &#34;Ho Hey,&#34; but I strongly encourage purchasing this album. The Head and The Heart and Of Monsters & Men are similar bands that you may like.<br />Uplifting, slow, great music, cheerful lyrics, interesting lyrical topics.<br />This album made me want lie down in warm grass. It makes you feel sad sometimes, but a good kind of sad. Even though the band doesn't directly sing about love, you get the real sense of it in their lyrics and mournful tone.
0545091020|4.0|our trip went a lot faster with this book on cd's we all enjoyed it. The whole family. thank you
B000PUV1ZI|5.0|One of the best family fantasy movies of all time. Great cast, great story. How could anyone not like this movie.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Typical Hollywood plot, evil corporations, evil governments, tired plot line, nothing original, only saving grace is the special effects, not enough to save it...
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is great it's addictive and challenging. It's just like zoo tycoon so if you love that game you'll love this game
B0013D8LCW|4.0|Great story line, different locations (I'm from Los Angeles and I don't often go to San Pedro, myself), characters who say, mostly, believeable lines.  A story line that is believeable (is that an oxymoron for Hollywood, or what).  Would really like to see where the main characters are at now, 2013.  Especially with the political climate so much different now, even from 2007, when this movie was made.  SCOTUS, ready to make some important decisions on Prop 8  and DOMA.  Where would life have taken the main characters in six years, Mr. Markowitz?? The time is right for a sequel!!
B00821OX98|5.0|I think it's a great series, well done and not cheesy.  Maybe they'll air this one all the way through to completion.  I hate the way they always cut sci-fi series short.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I had heard a lot about this novel, loved the title and looked forward to reading it. I started it, read for awhile, then stopped. When a friend told me it gets better, I picked it up again and finished it. There are parts of it that were really good, and parts that were so far-fetched, I was insulted. If you want some light reading purely for entertainment value, this is your book.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Graphics and action are very nice, and updated as per the latest outing of the franchise. My sons enjoy it much. The only gripe is that the game is somewhat limited in the complexity it offers - after a certain level is attained things begin to repeat themselves.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I read this in late winter, early spring but it would be a great summer read too. I loved her writing - descriptions and images popped. Her honesty about her strengths and weaknesses were appreciated and respected. It is a story of realizing your personal best and one lots of folks would like to put to the test, but won't.
B007JMW46U|4.0|This is a great collection of stories, and the Kindle edition is easily navigable (especially for being free).  Well worth the $0.00.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I choose this rating as I enjoy reading his books.  His mysteries' endings are not predictable.  I would like to see a little more of his personal life interjected.
B0091REZMW|1.0|I bought, against my better judgement, diamonds so I could continue playing the game . When I tried to use them, it kept taking them away and not allowing me to use what I was supposed to be buying. There seems to be some serious issues in this game and I see no place to contact anyone to get these corrected.<br />I do not like games where you have to pay to continue playing after you have already purchased the game.<br />The least they could do is offer Customer Support to resolve issues!
B001FB5634|1.0|this film moved incredibly slow, very little action,gloomy and depressing from beginning to end. it was really hard for me to make it through this movie i almost fell asleep several times, if you have insomnia check this movie out!
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Tom, and have followed both Tom and his main band Cinderella, for 26+ years! Tom's new solo record is a looooong wait finally over! But!!! Well worth the 15+ year wait!  Glad to see Mr. Keifer back in full form, and hope he plans to make his way through Toronto, Canada soon!
B007XF4J66|5.0|Both my husband and our adult son love Casablanca.  My husband was happy to receive it as a Christmas gift.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I ordered this as a replacement charger for my Kindle Paperwhite. Thank goodness it works since I lost my original one almost immediately.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a good exercise tape.  After my hip surgery, I will be able to use it better. This was a gift to myself.
0345803485|5.0|my friend bought all the 3 books and lent me after she'd read them.  when i read the 1st chapter i called her and expressed my disappointment that she had skipped a phase in her life...i thought it was the mills & boons stuff! but when i read on, i was extremely captivated that i read all 3 books within a few days!  i loved them!!!<br /><br />i felt disappointed though, with how the \\"fifty shades freed\\" ended. i felt that the author got tired at some point and hurried through the book! i would have loved to see the move from escale to the new house. i would have loved to know if the red room of pain actually survived or shifted to the new house.  i would have loved to see what happened at kate's wedding...i would have wanted to know how christian turns around and embraces parenthood - the preparations for the newborn; the waiting as ana went through labour pains (or not), etc.  i feel the author cheated us in some way and succumbed to exhaustion or something...<br /><br />otherwise, i have read the 1st book twice already!<br /><br />oh, and i would love a christian grey version of the book...may be the next one!<br /><br />great job el james. i will read your other books. hope they will be as good...if not better!
B0040QYROA|5.0|This was a birthday gift for our adult son.  He is a fan of the entire Superman series:  comics, TV, and movies.
B000FCK65W|5.0|The Nolans went through a lot but they never once lost their hope or determination. This family is an inspiration!
B005LAIGSM|5.0|We gave this movie to our son's fiance for Christmas.  She liked it in the movie theatre, and was pleased to add it to her dvd  library.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I absolutely loved the series i finished it in just a day, i could not put it down. I love how it left me on edge at the very end of the book and i was so frustrated that i did not have the next book next to me and available for me to devour. I loved the series hands down, but then again it doesn't take much to suck a reader like me into these types of books
B000AA4JMK|5.0|This was a birthday gift for my adult son.  He watched my VCR tape of Oliver frequently when he was growing up.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|First off there are very few battery apps for Kindle Fire available at amazon app store, unlike Apple that has hundreds of apps there are only a handful for Kindle. After reading all the reviews for battery maintenance at amazon app store I picked Battery HD Pro because of the high reviews. I opt for the paid version instead of the free version because I feel the developer deserves to be paid for his or her time and effort for there hard work and also after reading the reviews I figured it would be worth it. But the biggest reason by giving money they will only work harder to make this app better.<br /><br />Ok about the app, Having used many free and paid for apps for my iPod Touch from apple store this one rates way up on my list of Battery apps.The one thing that stands out from the rest of the Battery apps is Battery HD Pro , Calibrates your device by putting it through a series of tests that take over an hour to do so, there for making it work for YOUR Kindle in a personal way, not sure how to explain, I'm not a professional writer so forgive me. Its kinda like your doctor giving you test before treating you. After the calibration the app knows how your kindle uses the battery and gives you highly detailed information on battery use SPECIFIC to your device. I know of no other app that does this, there may be one for Apple but not for  Kindle at amazon.<br /><br />OK ,now i'll try to explain why i gave this app 4 stars instead of 5. I have an app for my iPod Touch called Battery Boost Magic Pro, although it doesn't calibrate like Battery HD Pro does, it has a three step full charging process that this doesn't, if this app did that I would give it 5 stars. Maybe in the future they will add that process in future updates<br /><br /> Over all this is the best battery app i have come across, and is well worth the 2 dollars I paid for it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|loving this book right now - so well written, and very interesting subplots. can't wait to see how it all ties together in the end. recommended read
0670014893|4.0|We are told we don't need to know how our intelligence and security agencies are fighting their war on terrorism. It's true most people wouldn't be interested. But, John le Carre uses this book to shine a light on it to give us a glimpse into the modern world of espiocrats and &#34;corporate war&#34;. This has been the motif for his last efforts.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|This is a wonderful movie.  It's closed captioned which is great for my husband who is very deaf.  Lovely movie
B001NEYO8Q|4.0|Directed by John Ford in 1962, this is a classic western. Who could ask for more? Icons Jimmy Stewart and John Wayne together!<br />The only other time, I know of, where they were in the same film was &#34;How the West was Won&#34;, also made in 1962. They didn't share any scenes in that one though. Wayne was in only one scene as General Grant. This film also features Vera Miles, Lee Marvin, as a perfectly evil Liberty Valance,  Andy Devine as the Marshall, Strother Martin, Lee Van Cleef, John Carradine, Woody Strode and others. This is near the top of great westerns. Wayne and Stewart play characters who don't trust either, at first, but come  to have a deep respect, as the question is solved: Who shot Liberty Valence?
B0060MYK7G|5.0|Francois is great in this series. I am part of Bring Back the Borgias group and we have a page on Facebook. If you wish to help us get our 4th season then visit our page!!
0425263924|1.0|Book was all over the place.  Poorly written book.  Would have done herself a favor to have written a very good book and a great ending to the series instead of trashing it and trying to suck readers in for two more poorly written books.  I'm with the majority I'm returning the book and I am done with Sylvia Day books. Looking for a good author with great writings skills that are worth spending my money on.
B00A7W29BE|1.0|It doesn't work at all in my kindle fire HD,crashes every time n didn't scan just take picture for which I already have camera..so disappointed.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|The game was fun and just challenging enough without being too hard. There is a lot that you can play on the free portion, however I wish that the full game was less than $5. I would give it five stars if the full version was a little cheaper.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I'm three episodes into season III, and it's easily as good as the first two seasons. New villain &#34;The Governor&#34; is an interesting character. Awesome series...keep up the good work!!
1451695195|5.0|This book seems more credible than most of those I've read on this subject, mostly due to the author's background as a very sceptical neurosurgeon. His complete recall of his days in a coma and experiences &#34;on the other side&#34; is truly remarkable - the music he hears, his thought process, his description of things truly ineffable - all seemed very convincing to me.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Yes, yes, yes! Good characters and twists keep you reading!
B005IGDW24|2.0|It's not the worst movie ever, but it's not like the old smurfs. I guess Katie Perry in the cast should have tipped me off. The story isn't cool or cute like the old ones. It cimpletely lacks smurfiness. Yeah, it's got blue guys in it, but so does the Blue Man Group.
193700788X|1.0|I was really hoping for an improvement in her writing for this book since the last few have been very sloppy and badly needed to have been proofread before being published. After reading the comments and reading parts of the book at the library, I've decided to give \\"Dead Ever After\\" a pass. I can imagine a MUCH better ending for the series than what has been written. It should never have been written as a quickie way to tie up all the various plotlines and loose ends in senseless ways. CH could have achieved the same objectives with just writing \\"...and God/god/natural or unnatural disaster struck them dead (really dead in the case of the vampires). The End.\\"<br /><br />SEMI-SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!! *******************<br /><br />Part of my dislike for \\"Dead Ever After\\" is, as I said above, the quality of the writing and part was because I could not suspend disbelief (the hallmark of an excellent storyteller is the ability to make his listeners/readers believe his stories are true while they are being told/written) enough to feel involved with the characters and events. Sookie & Co were more like cardboard cutouts than people we felt we could have met in some alternate reality.<br /><br />Part is because Sookie has gone from a plucky, (I really hate this word, but can't think of a better one right now), down-to-earth but open-minded (in the sense of being willing to believe in things outside the norm) person to a rather brainless wimp. The Sookie we all learned to love was always willing to fight for what was right and/or persons she loved or cared about--- she may have lost a fight, fought to a draw, or won hands down, but she always came through her trials and tribulations with a better, deeper understanding of herself, her friends/lovers, and the world around her. The Sookie in \\"Dead Ever After\\" is just a pale copy of the Sookie that kept us anxiously awaiting the release of a new book in the series. She went from bold to blah.<br /><br />As for the other characters, they seemed lifelessly (not in a vampiric way) flat. In the earlier books in the series, we learned to love or hate the beings Sookie came in contact with. In \\"DEA\\", no one acts the way we would expect each character to react to the events around them. And having Sookie end up with Sam was just flat lazy and stupid. Sookie herself had said in Book 1, and I quote: \\"...I never listen to Sam's thoughts. He's my boss. I've had to quit jobs before because I found out things I didn't want to know about my boss.\\" Yes, she tended to have appreciation for his physique, but he never tripped her libido trigger. Eric in \\"DEA\\" is a spineless jellyfish-- the Eric of previous books would never have just accepted being married off and most certainly wouldn't have divorced Sookie, his conqueror's soul would have rebelled. He'd have been more likely to figure out a way to re-establish their blood bond, get rid of the Queen of Oklahoma & Felipe de Castro  in one way or another, and establish himself as a power to be reckoned with. Eric the Viking turned in to Eric the Spineless instead. Yes, the author has the right to do what she pleases with the characters she creates, however, she owes her readers the courtesy of spending the time to keep characters \\"in character\\" rather than have them act in ways that are totally at odds with their previous behavior and character traits.<br /><br />I won't waste my time picking apart the other characters, even though Sookie's forgiveness toward Arlene was dang stupid and I could write several paragraphs just about that plot twist.<br /><br />In the end, Sookie has gone out of our lives with a whimper instead of a bang. \\"Dead Ever After\\" will not be gracing my bookshelves with the other Sookie adventures. I'll save my money and hope CH's next series/books will be worth the price, but at this point I'm not very hopeful.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Purchased for my son a huge Harry Potter fan.  He loved it.  Would recommend it to anyone who likes Harry Potter.
B00CFO7PK2|5.0|A little too much Afro-Cuban sound for my taste but still love the songs! There's very little raw flamenco Cante on these songs! I was a little disappointed but after listening to the CD a few times, I grew accustomed to the Afro-Cuban sound! I love Buika and everything she does....hope for next time, she sticks to her Flamenco roots!
B009EFP278|5.0|Saw Olly Murs on Dancing with the Stars and liked him so I bought the CD.  No regrets , it's GREAT.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This case does not fit like the LifeProof case on my other phone.  I believe that because it doesnt fit properly, the phone has cracked.  If I had the box, I would be returning it right away.<br /><br />However, the other case has been great and I intend to continue using it.  However, I do hesitate to buy another LifeProof case due to the risk of getting another one that does not fit.
1579129129|5.0|Purchased for my son who is an artist. He loved it, would highly recommend product. Would recommend to a friend. Packed well.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I savor the way the subtleties of the plot and the intricacies of the relationships between the aristocracy and the servants unfold. Beautifully set, costumed and filmed to reflect the WWI period. It's like a juicy soap opera without the guilt. Mmmm.
B007WFR0QS|2.0|I saw Emeli Sande' preform on Dancing with the Stars and was impressed, I am not so impressed with the CD
1432794426|5.0|I have read several books on MJ including two of my favorite books Moonwalk by Micheal Jackson himself (of course) and Michael Jackson: The Magic, The Madness, The Whole Story by J. Randy Taraborrelli. I gotta say that even though I have only had this book a couple days, I can't put it down. It's a long book at 538 pages, but like Taraborrelli's book at 832 pages I hope to be sad to finish it and wanting more at the end. It is a collaboration with people from his most inner circle. These people were around him through it all and were his most trusted. I gives an up close and personal look at the man we love for his music, talent,humanity,compassion, his love for his kids, family, friends and of course his fans...a look into his world that the media would have never reported on because it wasn't \\"juicy\\" enough to sell. I like that it is written by a psychologist because Dr. Karen Moriarty is able to help you understand how Micheal saw the world and how his thought process was. i suggest reading Taraborrelli's book first because it will give you a close friend's perspective on what was going on and then read this book to help understand even more..I know I have grown to love and understand MJ even more just based the several pages I have read so far.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|I always adored the Wizard of Oz and now this movie is just as good!! Put it in the player as soon as it came today!! I will watch it again, for sure!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's really fun to play really addictive and I love it. I would highly recommend it, especially for kids. Like temple run basically but a more childish version with more colour and more graphics
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Latest update will not let me log into Facebook to challenge my friends...Would have rated it a five..Fix problem and I will change my review.
B00992CF6W|5.0|0.7.1 is wicked it finally came out there's so much to in this game get it please 7.00 is worth it.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|This series is one of my all time favourites - each book is stand-alone brilliant. I literally couldn't put it down.
B00933JL0A|5.0|The controls for this game are well thought out and work quite well.<br />Graphics are great but can get on the laggy side if you have like a million townsmen running around!<br />I wish there were bigger maps and building upgrades to improve on storage limits and production!<br />Overall this is a great game that has brought me a lot of fun, I never thought I would like a game like this but after playing it for weeks, I've actually had a lot of fun playing it and would certainly recommend it to everyone!
B008MEM24S|3.0|Although this is an addictive game.  I am disappointed because when I paid for the game it wanted me to keep buying more levels.  This was not cool.  I paid for it, I want the entire game not pieces of it.  There for the rating.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is one of the best games I own so far, not only I love this but friends who play it also love it!<br />This is one of those games that really get you thinking, &#34;what if?&#34;. What if it were me? What if it were really happening? Its not only a game that you play but it inspires a mental game while playing it, this game brings a lot to the table and should not be overlooked.<br /><br />I nearly passed on this one because I had not liked what I saw in the preview pictures, but after weeks of passing by it in the app store I decided to check youtube, I bought it 10 minutes later, faster than any other purchase I had made before, and honestly I could not be happier. I also bought the zombie virus, I have always been a huge zombie fan and I honestly could not pass it up!<br /><br />I not only recommend this game but command you to get it! It is honestly that good, you wont be disappointed by it!
B009NY43NY|5.0|Charlaine has delivered another best seller and I know I will be longing for more.  Even though it is one that you want to read from start to finish in one sitting,  I took my time reading a few pages a day because I didn't want it to be over.  I was kind of hoping for a different ending but I knew from the beginning that this would be how it would go.  Why does it have to end now?<br /><br />Also, why in the world would Charlaine Harris allow the writers (if you can call them that) to butcher her Sookie Stackhouse characters in the HBO series &#34;True Blood&#34;.  This would have been great entertainment if they would have followed the books but they have made such a mess on this show and it is NOTHING like the books.  So, please people, if you have not read the books and only watched &#34;True Blood&#34;, don't judge a book by this disorderly jumble.  READ THE BOOKS.  You won't be sorry.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I own this on Steam and I was happy to buy it for my tablet!<br /><br />This is one of only two games I own on two systems, its that good!<br /><br />This is a truly awesome game and I would recommend this to ANYONE!<br /><br />Everyone I know who has played this loves it!
1931559317|5.0|I picked this little gem up to help me get started in astronomy. Its small size and stay open design make it easy to take out with e to help me ID what I'm looking at. The maps are laid out nice and simple making finding stars a breeze.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I was on FB and saw a post by The Walking Dead about World War Z (The Movie) Had never heard of WWZ and I was interested, once I found out about the movie I saw there were an app, and while checking the app I found that the whole thing was based on this book.<br />So I decided it was time to get my first ebook. I could not be happier, I've read a bit of this book each and every day, I'm nearly done with it and wish there were more.<br /><br />This is truly a great book and would recommend it to everyone who is a zombie fan!<br /><br />I've read several reviews about how the stories are not linked in any way and it is just short stories, although that is mostly true, if you pay attention to the stories you will notice that many of them do tie into each other in some minor way, nothing big but it does bring the books together in some small way.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good game! AMAZING GRAPHICS! I played it on my phone, but found it works better on my kindle fire HD. I love it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft best game ever I just wish it would update faster.  For the kindle fire hd.  Other than that it is one of the best games ever!!!!!!
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|Very well done! I did wish for better singing, but the overall feeling of the movie was excellent and brought to life the characters I have seen in the snippets of the play that I have been able to see, This movie enables massive numbers of people who do not have access to the stage performances to finally see a good musical production of the story. Hugh Jackman, Ann Hathaway, Samantha Barks and Eddie Redmayne did awesome jobs, both as actors and as vocalists. The entire cast was very good and the production brought out much of the depressing state of affairs that brought about the revolts in France prior to it becoming a republic. Excellent period portrayals and sets.
B008VBYN80|3.0|This game is entertaining.  It has plenty of content, an interesting story arch, and fits the casual SIM genre.  The downside is its constant server connection time outs, it's barrage of advertising, the micro transactions you eventually need and a merciless friend recruiting system.  I recommend this game for fans of farmville and the like minded Facebook Sims out there.  If you are looking for a game you can play completely solo, offline, and/or free, this game is not for you.
B00AEK9BKQ|4.0|This was based on the film &#34;Breathing Lessons&#34; by the man Hawkes is portraying. Hawkes did a very credible job of depicting the polio survivor. The film was very honest and touching in the way the surrogate needed to go about helping him. One thing the film did not portray was how she spent time with him beyond that required to help him to eat and to shave and to get to know him and his unique lifestyle. The film did portray him, a polio survivor with a less than recovered body, as still having an active and engaging mind, even though his body was very limited. It also accurately depicted his hyper sensitive sense of touch, even though the muscles were extremely weak. Excellent portrayal. I was pleasantly amazed at how well the film was done, down to the haunting (at least for survivors of iron lung treatment) sound of the iron lung that started the movie.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Suits take awhile to get you have to play for hours for some there should be a thundered you can walk and fly whenever you want and should be able to buy all suits without experience and money last it's not a game you'd want to play for hours other than that an amazing game..
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I have a similar sharpener, but all the positive reviews for this one caught my attention, so I decided to give it a try. WOW!! Just a few passes, and any knife turns into a surgical instrument! So much so that after sharpening all the knives in the kitchen, I had to warn my wife. She can't believe how sharp her old butcher's knife has become, and I am still in awe at how sharp I can make my filet knife. I use that knife to cut thin slices of steak (e.g., when we have flank steak), and it goes through cooked meat like going through butter. I've had many good sharpeners in my life, but this one is BY FAR the best. Worth every single penny. I am probably getting a whole bunch of them as Christmas gifts.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|This is a true work of art and the best originally filmed for 3D movie I've seen since Avatar.  Its a very mellow film, so if you aren't patient and just let the imagery and story win you over, you might want to look at more typical films.
B0095P31L6|5.0|Watched this movie last weekend with family and everyone loved it, both adults and children.  Highly recommend for any family movie night.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and really addicting.  Progress will be slower but you don't have to spend any real money to play.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This is an awesome album from Tony Geezer and Ozzy.  Takes you back to the early days of Sabbath and if you were a Sabbath fan you will love this.

B005544TRQ|3.0|Nerdy nice guy genius is hired by the top gun of a high-powered law firm to be his new Associate for the year.  Thing is - the kid doesn't have a law degree.  But, he's so brilliant that he gets hired anyway.  The guy who hires him - Slick Willy - will do anything to win a case.  Did I say anything? ANYTHING.<br /><br />See I'm pretty sure you have to have a law degree or pass the Bar to be an associate Lawyer.  Just sayin.<br /><br />The plots are all about how someone is getting screwed over by some villain and then these guys come in and save the day with their witty and cleaver use of the system, or flat out illegal extortion, blackmail, or whatever it takes to win or do right by their clients, OR THEIR FIRM.  Firm first then clients.  So the Associate is like Chuck, hangin with the big boys but green to his core.  Its okay - some people love it - but me thinks its a bit middle tier.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|does not work on my fire HD 8,9 kindle. I get a internal service  error. can not start the game. Will give a better rating if I get it to work.
B004ZJZQJC|4.0|Granted, the technology is dated, but at the time, it was the first &#34;photorealistic&#34; movie ever. The sotry is a little odd, but fun. I remember seeing this movie when it first came out and thoroughly enjoyed it. The enjoyment is still there, but look at it with 1980s eyes, don't expect the hyper-realistic CGI you get today; just sit back and enjoy.
B005PK57NU|5.0|Great cast, great story lines. Highly recommended! I hope this series goes on for many more seasons. Loved it!! O
B008IYR2BA|5.0|So far I've seen the first three episodes; and this season is as good as ever.  Can't wait to finish up, and move on to season 7.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I recently upgraded the satellite receivers in my home and decided it was also time to rewire all of my TV's using HDMI the way they should be..  I found these cables and ordered as many as I needed as well as a few extra to keep on hand.  I was a little leery because the price was so good, but its been about 5 months now and I have not had any trouble at all...every cable has worked great.  I also have a HDMI made by Monster...that one cable was more expensive then I paid for the whole lot of Amazon prime cables I bought, and honestly I can not tell any difference.
030746363X|4.0|I found the explanations and stories motivational to help maintain the slow carbs. I don't believe I ever would have considered this diet without the thorough explanation. Good for anyone who wants control over their weight.
B0079R8KO0|3.0|The case is ok for the price. It does what I wanted, which is to cover the kindle. Does not sit as easy as shown in the pictures, but I suspect it will get better sitting up once the case as been worn in more.
B007TK77QE|5.0|This was one of the most real,heart breaking books. I found the characters so human, vivid and tragically touching. I would recommend to anyone.
B005KELWJY|4.0|I enjoy the Tab Folio because it: 1) protects my Kindle, 2) is black and I don't have to worry about keeping it clean, 3) it has a pocket for my notes, 4) the magnetic closure is very convenient.
B00821OX98|4.0|Though I really enjoy the show, Falling Skies can be a bit cheesy at times. This is a minor setback, however, and the show is definitely worth watching.

B00BSO2U1Y|5.0|I was not surprised to see the review written by the previous reviewer.  In fact, I was predicting all along that there would be some who would throw brickbats at this recording.  This \\"Norma\\" is the most radical departure from the more traditional Norma recordings imaginable and not everyone is going to take to it.  Those expecting a heavy, \\"verismo\\" approach to this opera, are in for a surprise (and not a happy one at that).  Cecilia Bartoli spent years researching Bellini's manuscripts in preparation for her presentation of Norma, and she's already performed the role onstage, to highly positive reviews.  She sang the role in a concert version as long ago as July l, 2010, but nowhere near as beautifully as here.  Gone is the huge orchestration, the bulldog \\"verismo\\" approach that for years made this opera sound as though it were written by Gluck, Verdi, or Mascagni.  Gone is the mature sounding mezzo soprano Adalgisa, the Rhadames-sounding Pollione, and of course, the venomous approach to Norma.  No disrespect to the great Italian conductor Tullio Serafin, who taught Callas the role in the late 1940's, but the approach here is to present Norma in the manner in which it probably was heard when performed by the legendary Maria Malibran and Giuditta Pasta.  Period instruments are used, and it's like layers of encrustation have been cleaned off to restore Norma to the original conception.  Bartoli, though mezzo in color, has a full and easy command of the top Cs and Sumi Jo's beautiful lyric soprano contrasts beautifully in the duets.  Bartoli sings \\"Casta Diva\\" in an inward, prayer-like fashion, turned very inward, and the result is a sublime \\"Casta Diva\\".  She includes both verses of the cabaletta, and embellishes the second verse in a most exciting fashion.  She does well with the declamation in the role, and her final act is beautiful and intimate, where she's aided and abetted by the gifted tenor John Osborn, who's lyric voice fits in with the entire conception of the opera.<br />  I admit to being a great proponent of the Callas Norma, and her work in the revival of bel canto operas is not to be denied or lessened.  What Bartoli accomplishes here is something equally as significant:  she restores Norma to the way Bellini intended it to be heard, during an era when the term \\"mezzo soprano\\" wasn't even heard of.  Adalgisa profits from being sung by a lyric soprano, and alongside a Norma who's natural voice color is mezzo (albeit with a fabulous upward extension), a completely different sound in the opera emerges.  Tenor John Osborn sings beautifully in a role that heretofore went to huge voice tenors like Mario del Monaco, Placido Domingo, and Franco Corelli.  Heavy tenor bellowers would not fit in this particular conception of Norma.<br />  I find it interesting that while the international critics and musicologists have praised this recording, \\"laymen\\" have slammed it.  I don't get it.  I've heard the recording three times and I find it to be a beautiful presentation, making Bellini's shine in a light never seen before.  But make no mistake:  this is a different \\"take\\" on Norma than any of us are used to.  It should be listened to with an open mind, concentration, and with considerable knowledge of the material in the accompanying booklet that comes with the set.
193700788X|5.0|It was awesome I couldn't put it down, the suspense to get to the next page kept me going until it was done after 3 days of reading so good I can't wait for the final book to come in November!

030759565X|4.0|I have a lot of cookbooks, and I am a pretty experienced cook.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading her book and commend her enthusiasm.  However, I honestly see myself only making a handful of things out of this book.<br /><br />Her heart appears to be in the right place, but this book just didn't deliver for me.<br /><br />If she writes another one, I will absolutely check it out.  I do love her style.  I just hope to see more recipes with a new and exciting twist.  The ones presented didn't do it for me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game and it keeps me busy when I'm bored. My daughter likes the game even though she doesn't really know how to play it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read the entire thing in one sitting, I couldn't stop. Once you get in it, it's difficult to put it down. It's written so detailed, it puts you right there in the mix. I love it!
B000SW4DV2|4.0|I like the little movie and so did my two little girls, it had a nice message in the movie which was always go for your dreams no matter what, don't let nothing stop you.. so with that I liked it
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Not a single story with character development, more like snapshots,of the zombie apocalypse. If anything, the thread that unified the chapters was the gradual reveal of all things zombie. I enjoyed the book, kept my attention and gave me the willies at times. Well worth the couple bucks.
B0037TRVD0|5.0|I absolutely love this album. It's a masterpiece!<br />I remember borrowing it from a friend when I was a teenager, but of course the sound quality of the CD version is far superior, even when listened to on a kitchen boombox!<br /><br />&#34;The natural cards revolve ever changing&#34; - indeed!

1401937519|4.0|The most powerful part of this book is the contagious energy of spiritual upliftment. Anita Moorjani's story of how she slips deeper and deeper into fear, overcomes that fear with a powerful love in a near death experience, a love far beyond what the word \\"love\\" has come to mean in our relationships. One has to feel this book, not just read it!

B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I wasn't interested in this movie but my daughter wanted to watch it. I ended up watching it with her and enjoyed it much more than I thought I would. It's a cute light hearted movie after you get past the beginning. It starts out like you expect most zombie movies to but gets more interesting as it goes along. I would recommend this to anyone looking to watch a movie that's not too deep and involved.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|Could not believe what a stupid movie this was.  Academy Award!!!! What a joke.  What was the point of this movie?
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I didn't see this in theatres because I watched the original series when I was younger. I didn't think I'd like it. I watched it and really enjoyed it. I recommend it to any sci-fi fan.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|Find my self wanting to play non-stop. What a fun game. I'm 49 and just don't want to stop playing. Give it a try, I'm sure you'll love it too.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this when I was a teenager and loved it's unison of complexity and simplicity. Mr Card really understands strategy and mental thinking. I usually don't like reading a book twice but enjoyed just as much as the first time.
0689861133|4.0|This was a good book for 1-2 year old.  Easy to read and keeps interest; as my little one flips through pages so quickly.

B003Y5H5HY|5.0|Never read the books so this caught me off guard 7 mins in. Great movie, but hid the kids because this is extreme adult content and I don't mean just nudity.
B00CL66FEQ|3.0|I am a huge fan of both Seth Rogen and Barbara Streisand, but I don't feel like this was their best performances.  There were definitely funny parts in the movie, but a lot of it felt really forced.

B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Darius does it again.  Although, sometimes the songs sound similar, I think that is because of his distinctive voice.  Another great CD that I will listen too a lot.

068484267X|4.0|\\"When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet in the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.\\" (McCourt 11) This short paragraph, Frank McCourt gives a good synopsis of his book Angela's Ashes. The title of the book: Angela's Ashes, refer to the ashes that fall of the tip of her cigarettes, or as she refers to it, \\"her only comfort it life\\". Angela is the mother of the McCourt family and is forced to put up to constant misery and she struggle to find an escape from her, and her family's life in Limerick, Ireland. This is all told through the perspective of Frank McCourt, who explains his experiences of what it is like to grow up in the heart of poverty, in many different slums, located in Limerick Ireland. This book was constantly intriguing, letting you into a whole other side of life, with events that were mind boggling and often surprising.<br /><br />This story begins with Frank describing how his parents met in Brooklyn, New York. Frank spends the beginning of the novel recounting his very early life in Brooklyn and explaining the many little adventures he and his sibling embarked on, although but when he is still very young his family moves to Ireland, where his parents are from. The story continues with Frank telling his story of growing up in an Irish Catholic home, in poverty, with an alcoholic father who rarely works, and how they often have to chase him down after work before he spends the wages on alcohol. Throughout reading this book the author describes his memories, not as if he were recalling it, but as if he were actually a child, in that moment. He explains what he experiences around him in a childlike way, with much innocence. As he grows older he begins to realize the problems around are not normal, and he struggles for a way out. I find this to be a very enjoyable aspect of the book that always made me to see how he would change and grow. Another enjoyable characteristic of this book is the plotline. There are many major events that happen in Frank's life that would never cross people's mind, some of these events were so bizarre and unthinkable, that I was always interested and captivated  by the story. Although the story was very captivating, it was written with a week structure; sometimes it just seemed like events, happening one after another, with no sense of connection between them. Also the book gave off a very dreary feeling, because it has a very sad setting and topic, this made it sometimes hard to get through.<br /><br />This book is for somebody looking to reading to read a very unique and harshly real autobiography. This novel is not meant for anyone younger than the young adult-levels, and it is not for somebody that is trying to staying away from brutality and vulgarity. It deals with very intense topics and is not meant for someone looking for a light- hearted fictional type book. Other than that it applies to any gender, or person. Specifically, people that would enjoy this book, may be interested in topics such as alcoholism, poverty, and childhoods with constant hardships, or just someone looking at life from a different perspective.<br /><br /> By working odd jobs and saving up his money, Frank McCourt was finally able to make it out of Ireland and go to America, where he worked his way into New York University and became a teacher. When teaching he would ask his students to tell stories of their lives and as he shared his experiences they told him he should write a book. Although he was apprehensive, because he was ashamed of his impoverished past, he released a book, and expected little response. Although, when the book was released it was put on the New York best sellers book and people all over were amazed and intrigued by his story. His book received the Pulitzer Prize and Frank went on towrite two more books about his life in America, titled Tis and Teachers man.<br /><br />I would recommend this book because it gives a chance to feel as if you had stepped in Frank's shoes, watching firsthand what is was like to go through a complex and difficult existence. It shows a whole new level of hardships, whether it is bullying schoolmasters, collecting coal from the side of the road for a fire on Christmas, watching your friends die, or near starvation, the story is told with authentically and with  exuberance. It's crude humor and unexpected make you feel like you are right there with Frank, watching his life pass by. This book has a one of a kind story, and you will be constantly yearning to know what crazy incident happens next.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|was on the edge of my seat.  very well done, acted and exciting.  love anything ewan mcgregor is in.  naomi watts was fantastic.  and it;s a  true story.
1781162646|5.0|Pre-ordered the book from Amazon for my daughter, an avid Stephen King fan who has read almost everything he has written, and she said it was awesome.  She said she couldn't wait to turn the page and see what happened next, and couldn't put it down until she finished it.  She loved it.<br /><br />Amazon's pre-ordering is great too.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|very boring and predictable.  the relationship, with the nagging, etc was a downer.  should have stopped at funny people.  was hoping for more but disappointed.
0446530573|5.0|This book has many great recipes, with easy to follow instructions.  The stories and narratives make it fun to boot!
B001KVZ6HK|2.0|Here's a note for UK purchasers who maybe favoring the American Combo pack over the extras free and censored UK disc. This review is not about the film- it's about Is it really worth going with the American blu ray at extra cost. Short answer: No. A here's why.<br /><br />Like many I was annoyed to hear the UK bluray was cut and missing extras. It seemed a  no brainer to just go with the American disc. UNTIL I GOT IT.<br /><br />First up the censorship.I didn't see the UK blu-ray, just the dvd (and I didn't see the film at the cinema) and I was damned if I could see any difference. i had to go online to see what few seconds must have been missing.  When I learnt about the death scene I honestly couldn't tell you what was different. I have to assume those more observant could spot it. As to your enjoyment of the film, you loose nothing.<br />There are no new scenes I could see or worth mentioning. You're not missing out.<br /><br />Secondly the extras. Now I'm a fan of extras and it's blu-rays trump card over other media at the moment, but this fell woefully short. Like the Hobbit, this was just the web features and the cast back slapping each other with no real depth on the special effects, the helicarrier etc. Not like  Prometheus that shows you tons of stuff.  The deleted scenes for the most part should have been deleted. The Captain America deleted scene is the stand out feature on the disc, and should have been in the film! But you can find that online.  There's an unfunny gag reel put to music. Commentary maybe good, but by this point I was feeling pretty underwhelmed as a lot of the other extras were unavailable to me, with no indication they would be.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: For UK customers the Digital copy and music will be unavailable to you, due to the region of your iTunes. It's only available to American customers. The DVD is region locked (R1) and you will need a multi-region player/computer to play the DVD.<br /><br />So for all the extra cost i get twoversions of the movie (It is playable on UK players- one 3-D which I don't need) with a supposedly censored film that I couldn't see being any different to the UK version, with lacklustre extras and unavailable content. Oh yeah, and just to rub salt into the wound, UK customs slapped a £12 import duty on it.<br /><br />Was this blu-ray worth it? Not compared to the cheaper extra's free UK one, in my opinion.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Been using this keyboard for years now. It's one of the best I've used and one of the few paid apps I have. Totally worth buying.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great book! Just wished that we didn't have to wait sooooo long for the next one! Way better than 50 Shades!
B003R0MF1W|5.0|Jane keeps me laughing and wishing there were people in this world that could really do that and catch the scums
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I really like this chess game. The game offers various difficulty levels and you can play against the computer or someone else. Plus it is FREE.

B008KP6ENE|3.0|If I could rate this game it would be a 3. Because sometimes when I go to jump it doesn't jump. Or if I press the screen once he jumps twice. The only thing I liked about was that I got it for free and it has cool levels to play. If it didn't have all the bad stuff that I found I would rate it a 4 but I guess they can't make games perfect any more. One thing to make this game better is either add more costumes or have it where you can design your own costumes.<br /><br />  #Makegamesabetterplace
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Everyone complains that it should have only been 3 books, but how can you really explain how you feel about someone killing for you in 1 chapter. You can't. Sylvia Day gave us a chance to get to know her characters more and how they may make an impact on one's day.<br /><br />People blame her for dragging it out when it could be the publisher wanting more. She writes because she loves too and tries hard to make her fans/readers happy. I thought this was very well written. She wrote with great detail and placed a lot of drama which is nothing new. She is showing us that in order to workout in a relationship you have to work at it. I will read the next installment
0307742539|4.0|I liked the whole trilogy. Fast reading that keeps you interested in what will happen next. Really a pretty fun read.
B00992CF6W|3.0|It's asome  but it does not work for the updates.that's why I don't like the Kindle because it does not let  me flippin  update it
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Same as the first season, only better. The cast makes it believable. The Director makes it all fit together seamlessly.
B00070DK1E|4.0|I had the earlier CD of this for a long time. I did the R&D thing, and I like my copy better.<br />Because, the gang down at the studio wanted to mess with the compression, and presence and<br />the loudness and the equalization.  I wish they had left it flat. Flat frequency response all across<br />the sound spectrum. That sounds like the buyer doesn't gain anything. There's ultra-low and<br />ultra-high noises and anomalies. I happen to know that when the first disc of this was made,<br />there was a certain amount of noise reduction done in the disc mastering.<br />Benefit sounds better. I've listened to both albums on three different sources.<br />But I have not listened to this album on a mobile device.  Only on MP3's I play on this PC, that<br />I also use to make my own personal copies. Far as I know, COAK is the last full album recorded<br />in the recording studio by Jethro Tull.<br /><br />Why they  changed the song order I can't figure out.<br /><br />.
B005FISBV2|4.0|The show is great but the case was broken the entire length of the hinge and disk 2 was floating around in the case. Luckily it didn't have far to travel from Amazon and didn't get scratched.
B009DKCBM8|1.0|I love Neil Young, however, how they decided against any sort of surround is beyond me.  This is blu ray, not 8 track.  Extremely disappointed. ARE YOU KIDDING?  No 5.1 remix?  Total waste of bread. Grab the mp3
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|good graphics. fun and not to difficult. keeps you wanting to find out what happens puzzles challenging but with good hints
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|I can't get enough of all the movies. The extended edition is great. It's too bad that movies have to cut out certain<br />parts. I wish they would do that with all the their movies.
8866130915|1.0|I ordered this for my daughter so she could keep up with her appointments and make notes. There is not enough space for the notes.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Star Trek has already been a popular franchise, this movie gives it a very modern look. Part 2 follows up beautifully, check this out before you see part 2.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|This story was Slow and drawn out at times, creative storyline. I am Curious as to how the movie is in comparison.
B007REW8DO|5.0|exactly what is shown. no scratches-never been opened. love the CD
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|I love hendrix and this album is a good production. There are some nice hendrix tracks on here...particularly i liked the opening track and track 6&7. 7 is an instrumental number, but it has a nice walking bass and hendrix rips on it until 2:34 when the track should end....he goes up into some notes on the 85th fret of his guitar and it kinda rattles the inside of your ears, not in a good way. Hendrix plays bass on one of the tracks, which was nice to hear...YES&lt; not the greatest hendrix album, but hats off to experience hendrix for what i believe is a fine production and nice album booklet. I have listened to this album at least 20 times in the last month or two and will listen to it again, some of these re-release hendrix things are a joke...this one isnt....RIP jimi
B00CWY76CC|5.0|awesome game really works the brain, need to make additional levels as me and my wife really enjoy the puzzles.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|FUNNY!!!  This book made me remember why I love Tina Fey! Unless you are averse to humor, I highly recommend this book! And if you are averse to humor.......read it anyway!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game and it is a good time waster and very very fun. Great game fellas and i need to make this 20 letters so that is why this is dragging on.
B005HED11Y|5.0|Brings me back to childhood and watching them everyday...great!<br />The image is perfect and so clear...great remaster! William Shatner is just amazing.
0783231032|3.0|Bought this for my husband for Christmas. It is a funny movie but I felt it had too much crude language (yes, I know it's supposed to be a send up of the times), and it had more language than my husband remembered.
B00C7JGDBW|1.0|What the heck, no combo with 3d, 2d, blueray, and ultraviolet?<br />I won't be buying this movie it seems.<br />I hate it when distributors won't make a combo pack with all of the discs.<br />I have bluray in the family room, dvd in the car, and ultraviolet for on the road...
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I loved this movie. Great tale of survival. It's definetly worth the watch but probably not intended for children under 12.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved it! Not happy with the ending. Hope I don't have to wait to long for the next book to come out!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I was surprised by how good this book really was, can't wait to read the next one! Hope they are just as good
B00BD6EJRK|4.0|This is a very good app. It lets me edit my pictures how ever I want. There is so many different templates and filters. My but (haha) is that I really don't think it should be $3.99. Maybe $2 at the most. But other than that it's very cool.
B00BXUG0KU|5.0|This album features Elias's voice and piano about equally. She sings out a little more than usual, that is her singing is a little rounder, less breathy with more personality - all for the good!  The overall sound is still very relaxed. Her piano is as wonderful as always (full, not all that relaxed), plus Randy Becker, Steve Cardenas, and everyone else sound great. I'm a fan.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I am an Adam Lambert fan and have his first album FYE which was an incredible pop album. Trespassing is so unique nothing like I've ever heard. It's a blend of funk, rock, pop, and beautifully written ballads especially Underneath, Outlaws of Love and all the bonus tracks could be in Top 20 on Billboard. Any of the songs on first half of the album could be #1 hits if radio had played them like some of the bubble gum pop mediocre songs they play in rotation. I've stopped listening to radio altogether because of the same songs being played 24 hrs a day. I just listen to CDs now. I would recommend this album to anyone that wants music they can jam to and won't get tired of listening.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|World history is often a very boring subject for many people but this book is a gripping account of historical events and how these events affect people on three different continents.  It's extremely difficult to put down when you start reading.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I first saw this movie back in 2007 and I have loved it ever since. I just recently purchased it again. There is a little blood and gore in it, but not an overly amount. The animation is so beautiful like most of Hayao Miyazaki's films. It's for kids and adults. I find myself wanting to watch it all the time, and I'm 26. This is a really good animated film. I would reccommend it to everyone. Small kids 7 and under may not understand it very well, but the animation may keep them entertained all the same.
B0087IT8LO|5.0|This movie was a truly inspiring story.  It made you cry and then laugh.  Everyone needs to see this movie
B005GFPZYK|3.0|NOTHING MORE NOTHING LESS IT IS JUST O,K ,NOTHING REALY GRIPPING OR EXCITING JUST OK.<br />THAT IS ALL I CAN OFFER I WOULD NOT REALLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great series....can't wait for the next book! I give it 2 thumbs up! I love all the books by Sylvia Day
0345472322|3.0|I read an article about Carol Dweck's research in Stanford Magazine a year or two ago and was intrigued and impressed. I bought the book based on that experience. The book glosses over the impressive and compelling research that underpins Dweck's message, but it's all couched in language only a notch or two above your average self-help book. (OK, I've never actually read more than a page or two in 3-4 examples of the latter, so take that measure with a grain of salt!) There are some interesting examples, but, frankly, it was the science that led her to these conclusions that I found persuasive. I'd love to read something by Dweck devoted to her science...
0525953590|5.0|Sean Carroll, who has become a worthy successor to Richard Feynman at Caltech, has showed that he can explain complex subjects in clear (though necessarily non-mathematical) terms.<br /><br />Since live about 150 miles from Boulder, it is tough for this old Caltech PhD (1965) to read the journals to see whether Dr. Carroll oversimplified the descriptions.<br /><br />(And if you show this to Dr. Carroll, note that he's not QUITE at the level of Murray Gell-Mann, yet!)
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a while. There are few good movies depicting this time period
B00571F26Y|2.0|We'd all be dead, blind or have some other horrible affliction by now, given that most westerners have eaten alot of wheat in their lives.  This sounded out there as I read it as he put out all these cause and effect relationships, but I'm no researcher and far too lazy to verify his references, but read a few reviews by peers.  Seems like pure junk science where he just takes research and quotes it however he wants, I guess hoping no one will notice.  Interesting strategy.<br /><br />That said, I bought it because I unfortunately have a wheat allergy and after trying to just cut back, discovered I need to cut it out altogether.  So it did kind of serve as a &#34;scared straight&#34; thing for me, hence the two stars.  And a few amusing lines, too.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Kept me at the edge of my seat.  Go Sookie!  Charlaine Harris has done it again, a must read if your a fan.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you have like video games or technology do yourself a favor and read this book.  The only bad thing about it is that you inevitably finish it and then you are sad.  Someone please give me some recommendations of books that are similar to this awesome piece of writing.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Great show, excellent cast, love to hate Pegg Bundy!  She is awesome in it.  Jax is quite delicious to watch.  Show is really good.  Recommend watching if you can handle a little dark humor and violence.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This is an incredible movie: story line, acting, direction, editing.  And I won't give away the plot - you must watch it.  I wish it could go viral, it's that good.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I purchased this movie as a gift for my younger sister and the entire family enjoyed watching it! I definitely recommend it.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|My first negative review, but it just had to be done.<br />I'm a huge fan of both Bruce Willis and the Die Hard series... heck, I even liked \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\"<br />But this was awful!  Action for action's sake does not a movie make.<br /><br />I know you'll rent it anyway just as I did, but you can't say you weren't warned.

1590171993|4.0|The character of Stoner's first wife is almost unbelievable unless she is clinically depressed or psychotic. The book is well written and easy to read, but the lengthy discussions of Renaissance literature, etc.  will turn off some people.

B00BX50UEC|5.0|This is a studio recording (I think) of the Eurovision 2013 contestants. Eurovision 2013 CD has fanatic quality and a lot of talented artist on it. It has many different genres of music and various languages. If you are a lover of music like i am or if you just like various types of music then i recommend this album for your collection.
B005VPRG10|5.0|Bought for my grandson and he loves it. Can't buy a better toy for a child, male or female. It's educational and keeps them entertained for years. I've been buying Lego for years and have always been well pleased.

B006AZZPCM|5.0|I've used other apps for downloading YouTube Videos in the past and this is the best one yet. It's a lot more intuitive that other apps and EZ to use. It will even continue from where you left off after being disconnected. The only thing I don't like is that the ads are very close to the download button causing lots of accidental clicks.
B00BD62X14|5.0|like her clear voice not overpowered by instrumentation; lyrics ( interesting ones) included in cd; an album that you do not tire of listening to very quickly

B002RKSZS0|2.0|Just seemed like fluff to me, didn't seem to be a plot but more like a diary. Heard it was a spoof on Gothic horror but I seemed to missed it. Gotta read Emma now to see if Austen is my cup of tea.

B00AE2I4WK|4.0|My kids really enjoyed this movie. The dancing sequences were just great. The story line was predictable, but the dancing more then made up for it.
B008476HBM|5.0|I know 13 in the anniversary of this classic, not sure if it's 1813 or 1713 or earllier or later. But thought this summer would be a good time to read it. Though some of the phrases threw me, I really enjoyed the story of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. Going to buy the audio version and listen to it on the beach each summer. Nice easy breezy read. Saw the Pride and Prejudice and Zombies Graphic Novel at my local library and am going to read that, would seem to be better than just the PPand Z book with no pictures.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much I hear how great it is AWESOME!!!!!!! I'm glad that it is not so glitchy or crashes so easily are there other games/versions of this game? I would love to know!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Four episodes in and we're loving the show.  We picked it as our &#34;watch over the summer as a family&#34; series and so far I'm not at all disappointed.
B00CP2Z5TC|4.0|Everyone's heard of Diane Young, but I actually really like their Ya Hey song.  It was better live at the Weenie Roast 2013 though, the &#34;Ya Hey&#34; part sounds better without it being digitized.  Definitely a fun band to listen to.
B005MMY5RK|1.0|I have to agree with the other 1-star reviews on here -- CK might have been original and inventive, but that didn't keep it from being a real snoozer.  I think there's a code among professional movie critics that forces them to sign a document agreeing to always say that Citizen Kane is, if not the greatest movie ever made, it's at least in the top ten.  It's in the top ten all right -- top ten movies I wish I'd never wasted my time on.<br /><br />If you could get 100 professional film critics to take truth serum then ask them what they REALLY think of this movie, I'd wager that well over half would say it sucked.
B002NJUN44|4.0|The actors were fantastic in their portrayals of the people at that time and the story was excellent in its telling.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|The dimmer function does not dim enough to make it worthwhile. The alarm went off at 6:00 AM when no alarm was set. The digital display is &#34;fuzzy&#34; and not easily read; it is not crisp as it is shown in the picture. I wish I could get my $.99 back. I will delete it from my Kindle.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy Downton Abbey and cannot wait to watch more episodes!  I am thankful that it is available to watch through Amazon Prime.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|great actors good story great plot one of my favorites movies i recomend this movie if you havent seen it
B009AMANBA|5.0|\\"Lincoln\\" is without a doubt the best film about Lincoln to date and one of Spielberg's finest works. Focusing on the fight in the House of Representatives to approve the 13th Amendment while at the same time portraying Lincoln's personal struggles during the same period of time, the film's attempt to remain true to history while at the same time telling a compelling story is admirable and the film succeeds beyond what could be reasonably expected considering the ambition of the production. The portrayal of Lincoln, in particular, is nuanced and shows a side of Lincoln which may not be familiar to many viewers. At the same time, the film's portrayal of Lincoln manages to capture the power of Lincoln's presence. This film is a must see for history buffs and political junkies alike.<br /><br />The only potential issue with the film is that it focuses on the political process and is dialogue heavy. While neither of these aspects is a weakness of the film, it should be noted that viewers who have no interest in the nuances of the political process or who are not prepared to deal with the density of the dialogue may find the film inaccessible.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Nice game, I like it, and it never ends. Never ending fun! I cant wait until I get a higher score then my friends!
B000YABS8E|5.0|This is a great underrated movie about an iconic era.  If you like Atomic Cafe, you'll love this story about nastalgia.
B009ZQ8FQG|1.0|I am unable to get it to play on my iPad Mini, can anyone help? I installed the amazon video app but it says I'm using an HTTP proxy???
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this book! Very well executed, I feel like I should start prepping for the zombie apocalypse, lol.
B008602KQI|5.0|The book has more details, but the movie really does a good job of following the essence of the book.<br />Well done!
B0033WH6UE|5.0|Testament still packs a punch! Damnation exceeded my expectations from Test. This is the best compact disc I've heard in over 10 years! They nailed it.!!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I use this on all my android devices.  I am glad the restricted amazon market has this available... wish they were more compatible with google play, or just authorized rooting.
B001GD5ALO|5.0|Oasis is one of those bands you can turn on one cold and rainy afternoon and let your soul free to imagine possibilities of things to come.  [WTS]MG is great to listen to especially if you're in the company of someone whose love, touch, and affection you crave and desire more than the dry, parched, cracked desert aches for the sweet release of rain from the dark clouds above.
B0015AARJI|4.0|I am very happy with the used controller that I purchased.  I am always a little nervous to purchase something that is used but this product is in pretty good shape.  One of the buttons is a little loose but other than that, it works great. Delivery was timely as well.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a really good game please get THIS RIGHT NOW ! ! ! Don't wast a minute get it Now im begging you get it now  ! ! !
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I am sick of these authors dragging these books out. Yes they are good but when they end!! Shame on you Sylvia Day for dragging this series out. I'm irritated that in light I probably won't buy the next book!
B00AEFY66U|5.0|I haven't seen the new movie, but I thoroughly enjoyed this version.  Watterson and Redford will be hard to upstage in my opinion and the costumes and culture of the time period are perfectly done.
B008IJT0CE|3.0|used this one when the dog returned from surgery and he loved the soothing sounds - simple - would get it if it is free  - but would not pay 4 it
B001EUSN6S|5.0|this is the only movie ive watched over 15 times and every time i watch it i cant stop myself from shedding tears. Many will say the original Korean version is much better but I've seen them both and fell in love with this version. don't just take my word for it, watch it! you will not regret it
B00005N5S2|5.0|Not exactly Patton, but Peck does a nice job. The FDR character really sells the picture for me. Ed Flanders does a great job as Truman also.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is  alot better than temple run. There are daily missions and a more interactive setting.The only thing that I dont like about the tablet edition is that it seems to have a delayed reaction sometimes.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|Loved reading this series in order just to find out the next installment. I think this is a return to Archers best writing. Liked the era and looking forward to the rest.
B00ARA4SLU|5.0|I really didn't know much about the master outside of his great films.  It was fun to learn about the part Alma played in his life and work.
B0006J28L4|5.0|Its the greatest moive ever made and it is a great chance to see a great actor play as as great man.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Great way to waste time.  You gain Aura pretty fast compared to other games. I wish you could buy a shield witn seeds or nectar instead if aura.  I dont want to lose all my loot when I am sleeping because I dont have cash to pau for Aura
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|When I heard they were going to span The Hobbit over three movies, my expectations fell for the project.  I enjoyed the movie tremendously, but the longer than long &#34;battle&#34; type scenes and repeatedly-just-too-lucky-to-be-true narrow escapes (to annoying degrees) got on my nerves.  Still, well-acted and I look forward to the next one.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|OMG!<br /><br />Amazon rocks the cd music vibe - 1st in town Minneapolis with fab Black Sabbath.  Mucho kudos to UPS brown, also.  All you guys rock!<br /><br />Great Ozzy lyrics out the friggin' ying-yang! - SG riff-king Tony just won't let up with unspeakable cool tone! Gibson Guitars -  you folks should be so lucky - deep-fast-heavy-melodic bass hooks from pro Geezer - awesome Brad drum \\"explosions\\" of percussion. An inspiration to Rock!  Fabulous liner notes - a keeper, 4 sure!<br /><br />Praise the dark world for Sabbath fans - it is confirmed with this collection of great songs!!
B008B0QH5S|3.0|There's something catchy with every Pet Shop Boys and it's because they know where the tendencies of dance and pop go and organically, mix in their own songs. This is not easy and it requires a vast knowledge in music, art and the every changing &#34;sing of the times&#34;. That's why the PSB are timeless and a very good reference of the pop culture of this time.<br /><br />But in this case, Elysium sounds more like a generic pop-dance album, made on the run and, because of that, the influences oversaturate the natural PSB sound and the album sounds dull and boring.<br /><br />Maybe this is the reason that the PSB are rushing a new album (&#34;Electric&#34;)
B004DBU0UW|5.0|watching this version. The first five minutes when you see George C. Scott playing Patton in front of the biggest American flag available sell this movie. It is an inspirational, well-executed, piece of American movie history.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Wish there was still more to come.. Very interesting how different from Ture blood the novels are and very glad too..
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|if your bord you should get this game . it lot better then a regualer race take u should relly should get this
B004SYP5WC|5.0|Works as promised.  Keeps me mindful of all bills I have coming up. One of the more important app in my collection.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I looked up this series after watching the series on A & E. I find the books even better than the series. The setting and the characters put me in mind of the works of the late Tony Hillerman, with a twist of the wry humor in Robert Parker's Spenser. A thoroughly enjoyable read and I look forward to more of these books.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I hate it on the kindle it does not update at all so I Don't think that you should get it it is just a waist of money
1400069289|5.0|This is a great book that gives enormous insights, through a mix of storytelling and science that really delivers the point home... your actions are largely based on habits, that you barely know and are effectively not even in control of.<br /><br />It's an eye opener. Highly recommended.
B000068QVN|5.0|Grand Funk was the best rock group in 1971 and this CD shows it as proof 42 years later now.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I dont even remember how i discovered Nalini Singh but all i can say is WOW!!!! There are very surprises in a series that just keeps goint but what i can say is thank you for being a wonderful author and taking your fans on a journey that hasnt stopped since this series has started. She never leaves a character hanging in the wind and lets us see the outcomes in each books she writes. I love the archangel series also it is as good as this series. Who would have thought that Kaleb was a good guy. What a WONDERFUL STORY!!!!! Dont deny yourself because of the price it is that wonderful. Thanks again Nalini Singh for all the hard work and dedication to your fans we all love you and wait very!!! impatiently for your next work of art!!!
0525478817|4.0|TFiOS was a very good book. As someone who wants to work in pediatric cancer medicine, I found this book gave a glimpse into the psyche of a cancer person. It was very sad at times, but a lot of Green's humor was a refreshing break from the sadness. My only complaint was the ending; I found it a touch ambiguous.This is the first book of Green's that I have read (after being a longtime nerdfighter, a fan of the vlogbrothers on YouTube)and I look forward to reading more of his books! I think \\"Looking For Alaska\\" is my next step. DFTBA and read TFiOS!
B001KZG99A|5.0|Enjoyed this movie as a family. Lots of action and the whole family totally enjoyed viewing this prime time movie.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|Well written, great cast. Chuck Lorre does it again and makes being a genius look cool. Thanks Amazon for acquiring the set.
B00992CF6W|3.0|The product is great....the user is not.  This is a fine product if you know how to use it.  I am not Minecraft savy.
B00884GR0W|5.0|when my brother made my mom get the game I couldn't wait to play it. So when I<br />got the game for the first time I didn't want it play any other game on my device.<br />GET THIS GAME. IT HAS THE BEST GRAPHICS EVER SEEN ON A GAME!!!!!!!!!BUY THIS GAME PEOPLE!!!!!
B0085TKAW6|5.0|As usual Ken Follett delivers an enthralling story line that has action, power and history well combined.  Could not put this one down.
B00AGOGOLE|4.0|This app so far isn't bad but I wish the video camera audio was more loud and clear and that the video camera was less grainy other than that good app
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's the best game ever it doesn't glitch or anything  I love it soooooooooo much it's my totally like favorite game
B005XN3150|5.0|a great show, written very well, characters have great depth.  an interesting twist to your average fairy tale characters.  my favorite show.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I'm just starting to use Twitter.  I am still trying to get the hang of it but the overall use of the app is great.  I like following my friends and fav celebrities.
B005544V6A|5.0|Probably top three shows I have ever seen. My wife and I love it. We can talk thru it and celebrate together when awesome things happen. Really witty with great quotes. Love the soundtrack.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|love it!! It's my most favorite mahjong..I have three. I like all the different patterns. Would recommend to my other kindle friends.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|love the show and science is mind bending. Sometimes I think I'm watching a movie. Walter is hilarious. Would recommend the show to anyone
B00B9HTK1S|3.0|I am only on the first chapter and this isn't an app it's a book I mea how can you fix that?!?
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I love this movie and can't wait for the next installment. I definitely recommend you watch Iron Man 1&2, Captain America, and Thor before you watch...especially Thor to get some background on Loki.
B002EDH0FE|1.0|Another stupid movie from the director of 300.  Really had no storyline.  The characters (whom you are supposed to already know and realize their super powers) were such flawed and awful people, you have to be crazy to feel any kind of sadness when they are killed.  And of course there are pointless, naked sex scenes in there as if they are a requisite part of film making or something.  Absolutely ridiculous.  Bad acting topped everything off.  It was like 300 based in the 1980s.  Such a waste of time and money.  Very, very confusing as to how people got paid for this movie and how this guy got chosen to direct the Man of Steel movie.  Even more baffling is that they are using his name in the trailers of that upcoming film to try and sell the film.  I would hide the fact that Snyder is director of any movie as best I could because he can't make a good movie.
159463176X|3.0|The first half of the book was great and pulled you in. But the jumping around and going into detail on characters that had little to do with the story was fluff. It could have been a great book because I felt it had a lot of potential. By the end of the book, I was even more disappointed because we knew very little of what happened to one of the main characters, the brother.
B009HUB40Y|3.0|It's okay..great graphics. I think people who know and understand how to play the game right would like it. That's not me so I only play it once in a while.
B00B3HJLX6|4.0|If you like in your face powerful hard rock, this will work well! Allen is tough as hell and there are no words for Portney.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|I like most LeCarre novels and this is no exception. Well written, characters developed enough to be interesting, and a few half-spoken lines that manage to suggest more than they have any right to. I've come expect bad endings from LeCarre; it's almost his signature. This book has no ending. It just stops. Maybe the &#34;Sopranos&#34; ending has made this permissible.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I enjoy these types of games.  It helps your brain functions and allows you to have fun at the same time.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B00CXN2JNS|5.0|I H8 doing this but I'm gonna review somethin that meets my approval. Megadeth has been a part of my life since 1986, so I've been through the thick and thin of this band. Today's music releases are so often and meaningless, that one tends to forget what they purchased a month ago. Think for yourself, and if you're a true fan, you can appreciate this new release for what it is, a terrorizing, brutal assault of the senses, i.e. Megadeth, bitches! Built for war slams, Super collider track kills, Beginning of sorrow tears at the heart strings, and the bonus track House Divided, absolutely brings it home (why this a bonus track?) Megadeth alive and still full of venom in 2013!
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|\\"Skyfall\\" was one of the rare times that I went to see a Bond movie in a theater, last autumn. I loved it for several reasons. As always, Bond movies provide exceptional escapism. But I also enjoyed watching Daniel Craig really warm to the role. (There was absolutely nothing wrong with his previous performances but in \\"Skyfall\\" he really was Bond.) Javier Bardem was marvelously creepy and Judy Densch, proficient and dependable as ever. The special effects worked well and the action was blistering.<br /><br />In the theater, however, the sound quality was muddied, and there were snippets of dialogue that I plain missed. The DVD cleaned up a lot of this muddiness. And in the theater I never appreciated Thomas Newman's edgy and sometimes, haunting, soundtrack. Just beautiful!<br /><br />I still have one minor complaint about the film: there were some missed opportunities with the cast. When I see the names of Albert Finney or Ralph Fiennes appear in a movie's cast, my expectation antennae go berserk. Unfortunately, they are given such little screen time that I felt just a little cheated. Anybody could have played those roles. I can't really assign fault to anyone, and it didn't affect my overall rating of the film. It's just me.<br /><br />One question: What was with the \\"Transporter\\"-ish poster and cover designs? Couldn't they come up with something original for Bond's 50th birthday?
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|After the second book, I was geared up to finally see what happened with Gideon and Eva in what I thought was the final installment of the series. Yet, as I read on I was kind of surprised that the book dragged a little bit. I am interested mainly in Gideon and Eva and what THEY are going through; however, you get a lot of \\"filler\\" with Megumi, Cary, her parents, etc. etc. etc. It almost seemed as if this book was less about Gideon and Eva and more about everyone else, which was a little disappointing. I was in LOVE with the second book--thought it ended on SUCH a high note and I was DYING to read Entwined With You so I could finally see what happened, but I feel (like other reviewers apparently) that it was just winding along without much action. Of course, I will read the other installments (however many she writes) because now I'm too invested and have to see what happens, but this book was okay at best. I liked it, but don't expect it to invoke the same response that book 2 of this series did.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the latest attempt by Peter Jackson to cash in on his notoriety for 'The Lord of The Rings', and is, IMO the weakest of the Tolkien books that he has directed.<br /><br />The movie starts out in the LOTR universe with an older Bilbo working on his story, after Frodo leaves to wait for Gandalf to come for Bilbo's party, thus starting the viewer out in the future, to then go back and recount Bilbo's past. And it is here where the movie then drags, going slowing from the meeting of the dwarfs, to Bilbo's first encounter with trolls/orcs, to their coming to the elf city of Rivendell.<br /><br />There are some action sequences, and some good CGI effects, but these are spaced far enough apart that one is almost bored by the time the action commences.<br /><br />The other major complaint with this movie is the choice that Jackson has made to make a single story, the finding of the ring, into a 3-MOVIE experience, so that at the end of this movie, when you are expecting the confrontation with Smog, the movie ends abruptly, and we are forced to wait for the next &#34;installment&#34;.<br /><br />&#34;The Lord of The Rings&#34; is one of my favorite series of books, and the films for that set, Jackson did justice to, but this time it seems as all that he is doing here is trying to milk hobbit and middle earth fans into paying to see another trilogy. 'The Hobbit' does fit in the middle earth universe, but not in this incomplete state.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|We sleep better since adding this to our evening.  I was amazed how customizable it is.  It is nice to choose between so many sounds and then layer them with separate volume control.  I don't miss rainy country nights as much now.  Thanks!
B00B8WXFWE|4.0|I have been a fan since I was about 6 years old! The Block was better, but this album is great too. NKOTB is still doing great for being their age and still rockin! This album isn't as upbeat as the last, but if you're a real fan you'll love it for sure!
B001NA6096|3.0|The star of the film was Vienna -- continually surprising and delightful.  The human actors were less stellar.  Julie Delpy was quite good, but Ethan Hawke wasn't at all appealing, annoyingly bossy and self-centered, and one couldn't detect any chemistry between the two.  The script dragged and the pace was slow.<br />This isn't an unusual type of adventure and could have been much more interesting.<br />PS: How could the two NOT have attended the play they were specially invited to by the actors, one of whom played a cow?  Important travel tip:  always follow up on such leads.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I have never read a book more than once in my entire life...except this one.  It's a great story with wonderful characters.  It's witty, clever, and funny as hell,  but most importantly, it's a great romance with sex hot enough to disintegrate your panties....if your wearing any.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|It works as what the ad say.  Easy to connect to my notebook.  I will recommend this product to others.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game sort of reminds me of feeding frenzy, and echo the dolphin.  But you get to eat people!!  And they scream, and it makes me happy when I'm having a bad day!  LoL. I Love that you play the shark, and not only get to kill people on the beach, but can explore the depths below.  Fun fun game.  I Love it
B009JZTOG8|5.0|A fresh take on fairytales. Einstein said,<br />“If you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairy tales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairy tales.”<br />I think you need to read fairy tales first and really understand them to appreciate the take-off here, but it makes for a fun re-imagining of the tales in a modern world.
B009MO5960|4.0|I love the Resident Evil movies, but this one is not my favorite. It arrived on time and in perfect condition. I had already seen it and was very satisfied with the purchase. If you liked the first 4 movies you' enjoy this one too!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I had heard from others how good Downton Abbey was and it proved to be so.  Beautifully done.  I'm so glad I watched it.  Cannot wait til next season.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|My kids got it first and it is a lot of fun. Passes the time with no glitches and very easy to use controls.
