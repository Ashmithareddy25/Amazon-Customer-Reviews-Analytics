B0021L8V0M|1.0|Sooo bad, don't know where to start!    First of all, got a problem with the director and screenwriter who seem to relish seeing women take it in the face. I mean, look how many times Jolie's face is practically bashed in (even as a little girl!) But, in the next scene, her face has totally healed, no bruises even! Wow!    The chase scenes (and there are LOTS!!) fail to suspend even the smallest reasoning. Why did Jolie run WITH the traffic in the first chase scene when she's jumping off freeway off-ramps hundreds of feet high to tiny trucks below? The big Gov. SUV chasing them could never have negotiated a U-turn to go after her, but NO, she keeps running straight and predictable.    Another scene, when she impossibly gets out of the cop's patrol car she steals a fashionable black and white striped (racoon?) fur hat and ends up on a boat out of the harbor and the hat has magically paired itself with a matching fashionable pancho thing with the same fur lining!!    I'm sure there's more moronic goings on in this dud, but I can't bring myself to watch it all. Did see the lame ending that SCREAMS sequel! Might have been good if there'd been some story. And too bad composer James Newton Howard wasted his time on this one. Even he wasn't inspired.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Sure, the new STAR TREK movie has an avalanche of special effects with a dizzying plot--BUT it also uses every opportunity to give a nod and a wink to fans of the original characters.  An excellent cast takes us back to see how the crew of the starship Enterprise became the characters we've known and loved so well.<br /><br />Brash, swaggering James T. Kirk storms into command with all the heroic energy we remember from Shatner's service in the original series, right down to his taste in women all across the galaxy (the green ones, I mean).  Spock is brilliant but conflicted with his half-human existence.  Bones utters his fondly-remembered taglines.  A very smart take that wisely reviewed all the original material--something you don't see that often in Hollywood!<br /><br />But the script's cleverness isn't limited to how it plays its inside jokes: the story not only risks the entire Federation, it risks the history we already thought we knew about these characters!  In a time travel thread in the story, a beloved actor from the original series makes his appearance to let the young Enterprise crew know that all bets are now off and they could change a destiny we already know.  That's clever!<br /><br />I don't believe there's a dull moment in the entire running time.  This is carefully-crafted, meticulously-detailed film that will keep the casual viewer hopping--and the Trekkie deliriously satisfied.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|Considering the environments in which these songs were recorded, this CD is my all-time favorite of live recordings.  The DVD shows these blues greats recording on porches, back yards, kitchens, where ever they could meet up together.  \\"The Thrill is Gone\\" almost did not happen according to the DVD and turns out to be one of the best live recordings I have ever heard.  If you love the blues, I high recommend this CD.
B0043EV774|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I thought it was fun and it made me laugh. I saw it in 3D in the theater and my husband and I just purchased a 3D TV and I have now purchased the 3D copy of Alice and Wonderland. I am excited to sit on my couch, put on my glasses and enjoy this movie again and again.
0316548189|5.0|I didn't know a lot about Nelson Mandela other than he was in jail and fought for the end of apartheid and later became president of South Africa. I learned that his road to success was walked by a man with a bigger vision than himself. His true love, South Africa, was what his fight was for. He learned lots of lessons throughout his life and never seemed to stray from his passion that African's shall be treated as equals.

0553381695|3.0|I loved Game of Thrones. Seriously, loved it. It shattered all my built up pessimism towards fantasy and kept me quite addicted in a scary way. I had to finish it at all costs. Towards the end I realized that I'd better get the rest of the series quick so when I finish the Thrones I can keep on right away. Well I did finish and I did continue on immediately with Clash of Kings.    But something odd happened. As the first pages flew by in a fever of needing to know what happened next, I started to notice myself reading at a much slower pace. Eventually I started drifting ahead and accidentally skipping passages. I had to put the book down and take a break. So I did for a few days. Then I picked it up again and still found myself moving somewhat sluggishly.    That is Clash of Kings ultimate curse. There are parts of this book that really drag on. Just about every character can claim more than one slow chapter in the story, and they start to add up too much in the middle. At some points you will have to will yourself through this book. Yes I know it's a 1000 pages so what did I expect, but did it have to be that long? Game of Thrones is long, but it moves at a rapid pace and tells a very tight story. There's much to trim here, or at least to substitute.    Then there are little things. Like take for instance the aforementioned Kings that clash. Of the five major ones, none have their own character chapters. Granted four of them do have their actions mentioned by characters near them, but one doesn't even have that (save for a visit from another character). Another one was built up as a main character in the first book (and a bad ass one at that), and is hardly mentioned as most of his actions aren't even followed directly. It's a waste of a great character in a world of evil bastards. Another King is mentioned heavily early as a very interesting plot develops around him, then he just disappears. He's mentioned only when people talk of him not being there or doing anything, and then he's just there again. It's a great moment, but illustrates another problem with the book.    Because when he does arrive he's carrying with him a deus ex machina that is hard to swallow. What happens is hinted at, but when it happens it feels sudden and ill played. Then they do it again right away. See it involves some of those fantasy elements, which is perfectly fine. The series handles that stuff with care and intrigue like all other things. But there is now suddenly a lot of it in the book , and the sudden change of style is dizzying sometimes. This particular instance also seems to be too much of an easy way out, Superman traveling back in time style. There is no given reason that this character shouldn't be doing what they do more often, save for some tricky moral issues and some bullcrap about nobility before a very large battle. Just an odd plot device.    I already grow tired of hating this book though, so let me tell you why to read it. For one thing, the Tyrion and Arya chapters are never boring. Not once. They have great moments carried out by two of the greatest characters in the series so far. In trying to avoid spoilers I'll just say that Tyrion gets a whiff of power and does many things with it, Arya is caught up in a story that is absolutely riveting. There is a strong argument to be made in re-reading this book many times and just reading her chapters. Not only is her development substantial, but her situations are quite frankly frightening at times. There's a part with a man named the tickler and a gang of others that is a downright horror movie. And towards the end her paths unite with a man who instantly becomes one of the most intriguing in the series. His presence and actions are one of the few untainted in the name of good moments, and he leaves you with a mystery as interesting as any so far.     The battle scene at the end though really is a page turner. It's not overtly complex, but rather takes a great many things set up prior, and just knocks them down. The right characters get the right page time to give the full details of it, and by the end you'll be breathless. And truthfully while there are some character stories who seem particularly drawn out (Danerys and Bran come to mind) there is a lot of well contributed good stuff from most everyone involved. There are individual moments here that are incredible, there are lines that will make you clap with their brilliance, and there are twists every bit as shocking as the first book.    In the end this is about a 600 page story put into a 969 page book. If you can handle that you're in for a great story. Just know it's an uphill battle to get there.      3.5/5
B004LZRSBY|5.0|I received my BluRay copy of a-ha's \\"Ending on a High Note\\" last week, and have watched it straight through multiple times now.  As a life long fan, this has been a long time coming.  It is such a breath of fresh air to find a region free a-ha DVD here in the states.<br /><br />This beautifully filmed concert experience is a must for any music lover.  It looks and sounds amazing!  The band have never sounded better- which is sad, considering this is their last outting as such.  I was fortunate enough to see them in NYC last May, and this DVD really brought much of that experience back to me.<br /><br />Every song is a gem- from The Sun Always Shines on TV, to Take On Me.  For those of you to whom the rest are unfamiliar, you will not be disappointed.  This is truly a concert experience.  If you thought that these guys were a \\"one hit wonder\\", your jaw will drop at the throngs of adoring fans that descended upon Oslo for this show from all over the globe.  It is heartwarming.<br /><br />Get the BluRay- you will not be disappointed.  And then go ahead and get \\"Minor Earth, Major Sky\\", \\"Lifelines\\", \\"Analogue\\", and \\"Foot of the Mountain\\".  Then you will realize what this amazing band has been up to for the past decade or so, and what you have been missing all these years.  :)
1400079144|3.0|There are parts of this book that are interesting or compelling to read, but I could not get over the ending, it felt as if Mr. Brown was a modern-day linguistic Eiffel and ran short on his projection of how much steel he would need to finish. Sure I'm just the guy saying it looks silly, but The Lost Symbol is probably not going down as iconic of American fiction either.
B002VE4MW0|5.0|Love You Live released in 1977 and my personal fav as a young kid. Punk was peaking when the Stones gave us this sloppy reckless bluesy sweaty performance. I bought it on Cassette tape in 1977 and listened daily all Summer. The new guy Ronnie Wood shows what he's made of in great work on all tracks and the audience knows it. Listen to his carefully charged chords on Honky Tonk Women, Tumbling Dice, and You Cant Always Get What You Want. Beautiful. Don't let others sway you, if you love the Stones LIVE then get this forgotten overlooked gem! Several smokin tracks 'If You Cant Rock Me/Get off my Cloud, Cracking Up, and Happy. The critic reviews were negative when LYL was released but now it's been remastered and sounds greater and greater. Keith was dealing with drug charges during this tour but his work shines here too. Billy Preston also impressive on keyboards. Basically it's the Stones stripped down to six people and no more. Listen carefully, enjoy!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|How come there isn't a  Complete Saga DVD set with all the extras of the BluRay set?  Hundreds of thousands of us don't have, and probably can't afford, a BluRay player!  I have many DVD's including all the SW ones (no extras like on the BluRay set), so why should I spend hundreds more dollars for BluRay?  I'm a diehard SW fan (member of 501st, Rebel Legion, and R2 Builder's Club), but even this fan won't pay large sums of money just to convert from DVD to BluRay.  There should be a complete DVD set!!! Period!!!  And where's \\"Under the Dome\\" spoof?  It's the best ever!!  As for the Complete 3D set, it's coming next year (or so we hear).  All the better extras will be on that set.  I'm just not going to pay thousands of dollars for a 3D TV and wear goofy glasses I can't see out of anyway.  I HATE 3D!!!  Won't buy that set, either!!!

0385342055|1.0|I was a huge fan of the other books in this series but this new book is just terrible.  Becky is supposed to be a mother and yet she is still immature and caught up in telling lies.  I was very disappointed in this book.  I found boring, over the top, and it showed no character growth.
031261246X|2.0|Technically this book probably fine. The author probably knows as well as anyone the flaws in Microsofts code,  and describes in details the disasters that occur when organization use Microsoft products (and  get hacked).  The characters include the typical stereotypes: independent, handsome protagonist who hates his former boss;  beautiful XX chromosome IT person who sleeps her way into incompetent position; another beautiful XX chorosome  software engineer who wants to sleep w/ protagonist; evil incompetent bosses; evil eurotrash villian hackers.  Get this book in a library or bookstore a spend ten minutes just reading any chapter w/ Jeff (the protagonist)  debugging the viruses. It should only take ten minutes to read. Avoid any chapters if there is a woman present.   Summary: probably OK if you like movies like Speed2
0763644765|5.0|We bought this book to introduce my son to potty training. He is 18 months, and he is a book worm.    He thinks this book is hilarious. Smiles and giggles through every page even though we read it at least once a day. I've also read it to my 20 month old nephew and my 3 year old niece with good results.    The story is simple- less than 10 words per page. We cheer when the little boy or girl suceeds on the potty at the end.    Potty training has just started, but he did pee on the potty the first time within a week after we introduced this book.
0670020478|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book- I thought they were really inspiring- yes there are lots of celebrity stuff- but there is also lots of stuff about 'normal' people as well.  I was disappointed that this book doesn't give you a solution on how to \\"find\\"! your element.  I kept reading and reading and hoping it would be there- in the end I concluded that I will have to read this book many times- as a source of inspiration and with other books such as 'feel the fear and do it anyway' as it is in the book to get that.     This book is not for someone looking for a solution in their life in terms of what they want in their career path. You are meant to read this book, and think when you finished it- what have I gained from it?  And read it over another time and think something else- it is not an A to Z- plot orientated book- if that's what you want you will be disappointed.    I thoroughly disagree with reviewers comments that this book is misguided in that it doesn't emphasise 'traditional' education- obviously written by someone much older... This books (thank god!) shows the problems with our current educations system accurately- I know full well how this is, having had experienced it myself, and seen it in the schooling of both my siblings, and younger cousins.      Having been one of the smartest of my year in school, and then following a traditional route- quite forced on me really- by my parents- I can honestly say that I understand what the author means by finding your 'tribe'.    Slowly the creativity that made me who I was in school and give me my spark has slowly dissipated as I followed up to what was expected of me.      I picked up this book- because I was unhappy with the person I had become- and with it I realise that I have still got the chance to become who I was truly meant to be. I really hope that people find this book as I did when there are younger- not because it gives them unrealistic(but then who knows?) hopes that they will be the next Paul McCartney but to let people believe in themselves and not just become part of the standardised group and have everyone shine in what they are good at.    Life is too short to be unhappy and not be happy with what you are doing in life.  I am thankful that I found this book before I was the next person, in their 50s dreading to go to work and looking back at life and thinking 'if only...'
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|Intrigue, romance and so much more.      Refreshing to watch something with glamour and subtle innuendo, rather than crass language and blatant nudity.      The scenery is beautiful, the dialog is flirtatious, Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie take us on a chase that's a surprise from beginning to end!
B002ZG99TA|4.0|Other than terrible language, this is a great movie. So tired of Hollywood putting God's name in vain in great movies!
B004QYZATW|3.0|...to the point where I could have written the storyline.<br /><br />Everything about this movie was predictable and cliched, almost from the beginning to the end. I just watched this for the first time 2 days ago and afterward I asked myself, \\"Really?\\". Was that all? Maybe it's a harsh judgment, but that is what I thought about the Tourist. It's a one hit wonder, meaning I won't be watching it again.<br /><br />It's almost as forgettable as Salt, and that's saying something.<br /><br />So why give it 3 stars?<br /><br />Well, 2 stars on this site would mean that I \\"didn't like\\" the movie. It's not that I didn't like the movie; it's just that I wish I didn't catch on to it as quick as nails. The other guy who might have been Pearce never even crossed my mind as a consideration for BEING Pearce. Not even a fleeting thought of, \\"Could that be him? Nah. Bleh.\\".<br /><br />3 stars means the director made a good try of it...and failed.<br /><br />At least for me he did.
1439108277|5.0|If you have not yet read For The Love Of Physics, I highly recomend that you do so.  Please do not miss out on such an opertunity as to own and read this book written by the legendary Walter Lewin.    The book is so wonderfully written, Walter captured my attention from the very firs word and right straight through each chaper and to the end of the book.  I loved it so much.    What a fabulous experience and oppertunity to see the world in a new way, and see all the beauty of the Physics behind it.  Walter Lewin has proven that Physics does work and makes reading about it so enjoyable.    I have been a fan for several years now,and have seen all his lectures, and I will personally treasure this book, I love it.  Walter Lewin really excells in this book, showing his love for Physics and Art, it is a real eye-opener.    I know that you all will enjoy reading For The Love Of Physics, I know I did.    Anne M.

B000GGOCIE|3.0|I really enjoyed the different perspective and the authors unrelenting detail with respect to history, religion, culture. The first chapters totally captivated me. Unfortunately I was laboring to get through the book by the half way point. For me it had turned into a soap opera. Oh, I wish I could say otherwise.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|This is the album that introduced me to Radiohead. Before I heard In Rainbows, I'd never heard of OK Computer, I'd never seen Thom Yorke or Jonny Greenwood's names, and I couldn't tell you what an Ondes Martenot was to save my life. After finishing listening to this CD, my entire view on rock music changed drastically. This one album opened up my eyes and basically sold me on Radiohead's entire discography right then and there.    If you've never heard a single Radiohead song in your life, this is an album you need to hear. It has a perfect, emotional mix of songs, and of upbeat and slower pieces. This will have you hooked from the very beginning beats of 15 Step to Videotape's final haunting chord. There is not a single bad or subpar song on this album, and the variety is absolutely astounding. Yorke and the crew shine and show what they can really do.    While others would disagree, I place this album over even Kid A and OK Computer. It's a truly magical thing for a mere set of 10 songs, and it's even beyond Radiohead's usual and seemingly always present magic. I have fond memories of listening to Weird Fishes/Arpeggi and Jigsaw Falling into Place a bajillion times on repeat. This album can change your view of music--both on what's possible, and on how a band can deeply resonate with you on an emotional level. Give In Rainbows a chance. You will not be disappointed.
1400052181|4.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a really strange, but intriguing story.<br /><br />Henrietta Lacks was a black woman who died of a particularly virulent case of cervical cancer in 1951. Without her knowledge or consent, the doctors treating her took a sample of her cancer cells. Those cells became \\"immortal\\" - meaning they are capable of growing in labs forever, assuming they receive the proper care. The cells are named \\"HeLa\\" (HEnrietta LAcks) and have played a vital role in curing polio, conducting genetic mapping, experimenting with cloning, and so much more. The strangest part? It's all true.<br /><br />Skloot weaves together a number of stories in her book:<br /><br />- Henrietta's life and death<br />- The development and impact of the HeLa cells<br />- The Lacks family's struggle to understand their mother and her role in medical history<br />- Skloot's relationship with the Lacks' family, especially Henrietta's daughter Deborah<br /><br />Ultimately, although the book is centered around Henrietta and her cells, it's really about Deborah and her deep need to understand her who her mother was - both as a person and as a scientific contributor. What started out as Skloot doing due diligence as a researcher, led to a real relationship with Deborah and Deborah eventually takes over the story from her mother. This may have been because Henrietta's life story is actually pretty short, despite the HeLa cells' immortality. But I also think it's because Deborah had a real philosophical and moral dilemma on her hands - what is her family owed because of Henrietta's unknowing contribution to science? Or are they owed anything at all?<br /><br />The story does end a little abruptly, but I chalk this up to the fact that Henrietta's story isn't really finished. HeLa cells are still being used around the world for research and they'll probably continued to be used for a long time. And all of the ethical questions raised by the very existence of the HeLa cells will not be resolved any time soon. This book is designed to make you think more than to present you with a complete story.<br /><br />This book got a ton of hype over the last year or so and after finishing it, it's easy to see why. The story is pretty incredible, plus the writing is strong. Despite including a lot of medical and technical terms, history, and theory, it's easy to follow and understand.  The story pulls together a number of sticky and complicated aspects of American society that we're still trying to work out - the power of the medical and scientific communities, the common assumption that doctors know best, the blurriness of medical ethics, racism and classism. Deborah's quest to better understand her mother brings a really important human element to the book, which grounds all the medical talk and reminds you that the research done on HeLa impacts real people.<br /><br />In a nutshell: An intriguing story that will make you scratch your head and say \\"This really happened?\\" Turns out it did and it's worth reading about. Three and a half stars.to make you think more than to present you with a complete story.    This book got a ton of hype over the last year or so and after finishing it, it's easy to see why.

B004TB6GUY|5.0|This is a great compilation by Zakk Wylde himself of unplugged versions of 'Order Of The Black' plus additional material during recording sessions (first put together here making a well sought after material for BLS fans). CD (10 tracks) is titled 'Song Remains Not The Same' by the talented metal band Black Label Society. First 4 tracks are from the unplugged sessions & the remaining 6 being the sessions additional material. This CD opens with \\"Overlord\\" : great drumkit sound & vocals creating a great rock track. Other great tracks include \\"Parade Of The Dead\\" (a slow ballad track, great piano & vocals), \\"Riders Of The Damned\\" (great rock sound), \\"Junior's Eyes\\" (a slow track with incredible vocals reminiscent of Axl Rose of Guns 'n Roses), \\"Helpless\\" (another slow track with beautiful orchestral base track & great vocals), \\"Bridge Over Troubled Waters\\" (a Simon & Garfunkel cover, great violin/guitar/keyboard combination & vocals), \\"Darkest Days\\" (album version featuring John Rich) & \\"The First Noel\\" (beautiful guitar string pick-ups & orchestral base track). Solid track/gems/stand-outs include \\"Darkest Days\\" (unplugged version, wonderful orchestral base track, great guitar string pick-ups & vocals) & \\"Can't Find My Way Home\\" (beautiful melody & great violin/keyboard combination). On overall, this is a great compilation (well sought after wonderful unplugged & sessional music material put together by Zakk Wylde), a highly recommended CD listening.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|It has lots of laugh out loud parts and I thought it was a good book.  However, I got bored and started skipping over chunks of it just to get done.  All in all it was a funny, easy read and worth picking up.

B001UV4XHY|5.0|When the series came out, I made sure that I purchased it and everyone after that. I am a Harry Potter groupie, if you can call a senior citizen that. Waited for the day this eposide came out, was not disappointed, Watched it with my 10 yr old neice and friend, she loved it as much as me. YEAH for Harry Potter and his creator. Amazon is my hero for all of my wonderful purchases.
B002ZG9800|5.0|At least most of the reviews on Amazon aren't as moronic as the ones on the Redbox website. Those have to be seen to be believed. I'm not usually a huge fan of Jim Carrey. Not when he's in over-the-top slapstick mode in broad comedies like Liar Liar or *shudders* Ace Ventura (I did really enjoy Yes Man though), but he was terrific here and the movie was very cute and funny. The only reason it's getting bashed is because Jim Carrey plays a homosexual. If you're a homophobe, don't watch it. It's as simple as that. This is really no different than other characters Carrey would play except that he's gay. This movie deserved a wider release. Don't be closed-minded and give this movie a chance. It's a quality comedy.
B003ITZBVS|5.0|A must buy for any Batman fan. This film gives us the atmosphere we have come to expect from the Animated Series. It builds upon that, by actually telling a story that will stick with you after the credits. This is not a child's story. This is not a heartwarming tale. But it does pull at your heart strings. It does make you feel. It makes you understand just what it means to be Batman.
B001UV4XHY|2.0|I have just finished watching, and I am soooo disgusted. With all the money this series has made, you would think they could have some lighting on the set!! The scenes were so dark, I felt like I was squinting through 95% of the movie to see what was happening. I know the story line is \\"dark\\", but that's no excuse to not be able to see what's happening.
B002ZG98LO|1.0|I think there must be a contest among Oscar winners to see who can make the academy voters regret the decision to give them the statue in the first place. Else, how would you explain Natalie Portman starring in Your Highness or Marissa Tomei doing awful romantic comedies for the rest of the 90s? Or Halle Berry - just Halle Berry - what were they thinking? With Adrien Brody, one thinks that we have a winner as he growls and grunts his way through this tepid \\"action\\" thriller with the exact inflection throughout. I think he's some special ops but I can't really tell as his growling is a little too much like a mutter to really make out his words.    Beyond that, this thing is full of people just walking through jungles with the \\"spooky\\" music playing. Sure the Predators come eventually but when they do, you're too bored out of your scowl (and annoyed with the academy for giving Adrien Brody an Oscar) to really care.
B004TJ1H3C|1.0|The series has been a soap opera with occasional dollops of science, but never anything awe-inspiring. The Star Trek and other Stargate series introduced dozens of amazing inventions, temporal paradoxes, alien races--in other words, lots to remember.  But what is there to remember about SGU? Endless interpersonal conflict, school dedications, cheating wives, hysterical men silenced by macho women, gardening, I'm-smarter-than-you playground talk, repetitive trips to yet another star. Most infuriating was the endless blather about Destiny's mission, whatever the hell it was supposed to be. The soap in a tin can series was mainly the fault of scripts written by people with no understanding of the core principles of sci-fi: People in unimagined situations that elicit wonder. As big a disappointment as the endings of Seinfeld and Lost. Shame on you, Sci-Fi. (I refuse to use their new spelling.)
B0041KKYEM|1.0|I couldn't get through the first 30 minutes of this movie and I only watched it because of Natalie Portman....
B004D3BPH2|4.0|This is a good but unspectacular collection of a wide variety of Telemann's music. At the price it's a bargain.    Most of the orchestral music and chamber music is performed by the Brilliant in-house early music groups, centered on JP Belder and Jed Wentz. They give good performances well recorded. Not the best available but certainly good enough you won't feel any regrets. The small scale cantatas are well done, but not outstanding. The big choral work is very well done indeed. the disappointment is the 8 discs devoted to the overtures. These performances need more life; they are adequate but unexciting.    Do you need this much Telemann? Probably not but at this price it's worth buying.

0316069353|4.0|This is the first mystery that I've read that deals with the foreclosure pain and mess.  And Connelly does not blame the lenders 100%; he mentions that there are those on the other side of the issue who are scammers.  The one issue I did have with the book was how selfish, unlikeable and dishonest I found Lisa Trammel to be.  I found myself not caring about whether she was found guilty or not, wanting a win only for Mickey and his team.

B004NSULHM|2.0|Quite frankly I was just disappointed with this follow up after In Rainbows which, imho, was a perfect album. The only song that really stuck out on King of Limbs was Give Up the Ghost, which is a lot cooler to watch as a live performance than to listen to just the audio. The rest of the tracks were gray and immemerable. Disappointment is the one word to wrap up my reception of KoL.

B00123KF54|1.0|i'm not an audiophile and i just wanted a version of the album on my pc, but, marakakesh express sounds alot like the chipmunks singing.  there doesn't seem to be any low tones to the vocals.  did stephan stills pay for the mastering to make sure his silly voice got its signature ring. also ther is no music in the middle of my head. everything hangs off my ears or seems behind me. very wierd.  with headphones the music should feel like it is coming at you from in front of you not like you have two people singing next to you.  also the original albums sounded lush. this does not.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I know lucas has been shafting us lately, but blu ray is great quality and if you want the original theatrical versions just get the dvds! Also, the new special editions dont make THAT big of a difference. we all know about the han shot first, and the jabbas palace dancers, and the new hope enhanced jabba, but those are minimum 1 minute change. Also, the prequels arent  as bad as people say. Episode 1 sucks the big one, 2 is average, but 3 is pretty good on its own. also, there are bonus feature up the ass, documentaries, featurettes, all that good stuff. The only bad side was the documentary called \\"Empire of Dreams\\" doesn't seem to be on here, but i'm sure it's obtainable. Finally, 3d won't be worth it, Star Wars was not made for 3d, and I am not planning on buying a film in 3d that is not made for 3d. So dont hate, just buy the set and enjoy the greatest film of all time, the great Star Wars.

B0047Y17P2|5.0|Unlike many of Connelly's fans, I prefer the Mickey Haller character to Harry Bosch.  The original \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is, in my opinion, the best crime/legal novel I have read by any author.  This one comes very close.    \\"The Fifth Witness\\" is primarily a courtroom drama.  Not a lot of field action.  That clearly bothered some reviewers, but I did not see it as a problem.  This is an excellent story and very well crafted. All the usual twists and turns including some clever nods to the recent Lincoln Lawyer movie. Connelly provides great insights to the trial process and to the current mortgage debacle. He also develops Mickey Haller further as a continuing character.    For what it is worth, I too dislike Amazon's Kindle pricing which has escalated significantly now that Kindle is widely accepted.  That does not, however, affect my review of this book.  Also, for what it is worth, the Lincoln Lawyer movie is every bit as good as the original book.    Having said all that, I recommend this book highly.
B000003CM8|5.0|This is my Favorite Allman Brother's album!!!This is the album I discovered when I was living in Fla back in the 70's before they were even well known. Dickey Betts, Duane Allman, Greg Allman...it just doesn't get any better than this. You can keep Derek Trucks..........he's good but he's not anywhere near Dickey and Duane. Those days are gone forever, but their sound is HERE. A MUST BUY!!
B0041KKYBA|4.0|Matt Damon is excellent as he narrates this documentary about the US financial meltdown of 2008.  The topic is dense, so I can't give this 5-stars, its just not that exciting to watch.  BUT, BUT, BUT - that doesn't mean you shouldn't watch it.  I thought I knew all about the run-up to the financial meltdown, but I was wrong.  This documentary really explains how changes in the policy environment and changes in banking practices helped to create the crisis.  There really was more to it than people being greedy and wanting fancy homes.  That definitely played a part, IMO - but there were other lesser known contributors to the environment of high risk, high salaries, and no restraint.  The movie includes clips of interviews with financiers, politicians, journalists, and academics that were all involved with the financial sector.<br /><br />Inside Job highlights the many conflicts of interests in the financial sector - like, how they were selling mortgages to the average American and then betting that those mortgages would fail (without disclosing that, of course).  This movie is for someone that is looking to get a more detailed understanding of what happened during the financial crisis.  The language is simple, so you don't have to have a finance degree to understand.  And the case is laid out so succinctly that you will be ready to fire off a letter to your Congress person for letting this crisis occur.

B004LL1HM4|5.0|Utilizing the richest set of harmonies since Simon & Garfunkel and The Beach Boys perfected the style in the `60s, Fleet Foxes was formed in Seattle by lead singer and guitarist Robin Pecknold.<br /><br />After an impressively short period of time for such a new band, Fleet Foxes began to attract attention from various labels, including the group with which they're currently under contract, Sub Pop. Most importantly, however, is the attention they garnered from producer Phil Ek who has worked with the likes of Modest Mouse and The Shins.<br /><br />In 2008, Fleet Foxes released their debut EP, \\"Sun Giant,\\" as well as their self-titled debut album; both under the direction of Phil Ek. Both releases were met with enormous praise and sold well in the U.S. as well as overseas in the UK.<br /><br />Although Fleet Foxes' lush harmonies drew many comparisons early on, Pecknold's songwriting has a unique, enigmatic quality that keeps the music both supremely engaging and undeniably unique. Based in British and American folk music, Fleet Foxes made a surprising jump into the popular music realm led by the short and sweet \\"White Winter Hymnal\\" and Pecknold's lyrical prowess has only improved since then. The band's inviting harmonization has already created an impressive fan base that has been hungry for new material for quite some time, making \\"Helplessness Blues\\" one of the most highly anticipated albums of the year.<br /><br />As the sole songwriter of Fleet Foxes, Robin Pecknold has always been the clear leader of the band, but \\"Helplessness Blues\\" puts his vocals in the forefront much more than anything released in 2008. This may be, in part, a result of his frustration with the creative process after the release of the band's debut. In 2009, Fleet Foxes was in the studio with nearly an entire album worth of material ready for mixing when the decision was made to start over. Pecknold, unwilling to settle for anything less than perfection, required two additional years before a new collection of songs was deemed suitable for release. The result is utterly captivating.<br /><br />\\"Helplessness Blues\\" opens with the slow crescendo of \\"Montezuma.\\" Where many of Fleet Foxes' past successes utilized a harmonization that layered the actual lyrics of the song, \\"Montezuma\\" finds Pecknold taking hold of the words on his own while the rest of the band fills the gaps with a series of perfectly tuned \\"oohs\\" and \\"aahs.\\" The opening line, \\"so now I am older than my mother and father when they had their daughter, now what does that say about me\\" darkens the mood slightly from the band's debut, but the sonic landscape is so rich that it's easy to find the silver lining amongst the depressed self-reflection.<br /><br />As the album moves forward with the head-bopping \\"Bedouin Dress,\\" Pecknold's voice remains in the forefront, but Fleet Foxes' trademark harmonization, with each member sharing the load of the words on the page, begins to make its triumphant return. By the time \\"Sim Sala Bim\\" reaches its vocal climax halfway through the song, before a vigorously strummed acoustic guitar takes over, it's clear Pecknold's vocal hierarchy is not so much a takeover as it is a progression and the original Fleet Foxes formula is still very much alive on \\"Helplessness Blues.\\"<br /><br />The song most familiar sounding for fans of the band's debut will be \\"Battery Kinzie.\\" As one of two songs on the record shorter than three minutes, it makes use of a very similar structure to \\"White Winter Hymnal.\\" With an immediate bounce to the beat and one of the most balanced vocal harmonizations of any song on the album, \\"Battery Kinzie\\" is a likely radio hit in the months to come, but Fleet Foxes' brightest moments occur further along on the album.<br /><br />One of the highlights of \\"Helplessness Blues\\" is \\"The Plains / Bitter Dancer,\\" one of two tracks to be given a two part title. Starting off as a minstrel style folk tune, complete with tambourine and flute, the track reaches a turning point with just under two minutes remaining and blossoms into a choir of voices singing out into a seemingly empty yet resonant space. While the track is the second longest on the album, the fade out seems to come all too quickly; the mark of an extraordinary recording.<br /><br />Although the title track was the first to be found on the internet, Fleet Foxes' first true single from \\"Helplessness Blues,\\" \\"Grown Ocean,\\" is also the crowning achievement of the record. It's rare to see a debut single close out an album, but in the case of Fleet Foxes, there is no better location. With a more elaborate instrumentation and a balanced mixture of Pecknold's solo vocals and lush harmonies, \\"Grown Ocean\\" is the perfect blend of new and old for Fleet Foxes. It may have taken three years to get everything right in the mind of Robin Pecknold, but for those whose ears cross paths with \\"Helplessness Blues,\\" the wait will seem well worth it.k reaches a turning point with just under two minutes remaining and blossoms into a choir of voices singing out into a seemingly empty yet resonant space.

B000002UUX|5.0|In my eyes, it is. Even better then Peace Sells. Don't get me wrong, that's a 5 star album as well, but it has a cover song, and well this one doesn't. This is thrash metal at it's best (sorry Slayer). I've heard alot of technical music that bores me to death, but it is excited perfectly in this album. Blistering solos with riffs that will cause the average guitar player arthritis within the first few days. This album pounds your ears for the first eight tracks, then you get a short resting period with the Dawn Patrol, a short bass and vocal only song. Then it's closed out by Rust In Peace...Polaris, a punishing thrash masterpiece. This may not be the best review, but if you want a break from the kiddie metal of today, by all means get this album.
B003VYAVGA|5.0|I bought this album because I'm in love with singer/songwriter Robbie Williams.  You say, \\"WHO\\"! Yeah, Robbie Williams! The BIGGEST solo artist in UK history! You say, \\"WHAT\\"!  Yeah, that's right!  Won more Brit Awards than any other artist, has sold over 50 million albums worldwide, has performed to more than 1 million people.  I discovered the guy less than a year ago and I can't stop listening to him! Or watching him!  GET ON BOARD!  So you ask what's this album about....well Robbie Williams started in a \\"boy\\" group when he was 16 years old called TAKE THAT. They were HUGE...the biggest band since the Beatles in England..no joke!  Long story short....Rob leaves the group when he was around 21 causing the whole of girly-tweendom in Europe to want to jump into the Thames.  He, also, had a BIG alcohol/drug issue, at the time.  Well, the other 4 lads split up shortly thereafter and a couple of them really went after a solo career that didn't much go anywhere.  However, Robbie's career took off with a song called \\"Angels\\" which EVERYONE knows by heart in Europe. I mean they sing it for weddings, funerals...whatever!  So, he goes on to have even a bigger career than TAKE THAT.  Oh, did I mention, he's also an incredible performer!  BRILLIANT and FUNNY!  Oh yeah, this album...okay.     When Rob left Take That there was a lot of acrimony between the five boys.  In fact, Rob has written a number of songs about this...most famously, \\"No Regrets\\".  In the meantime, the 4 other guys get back together, like in 2006, and go on tour and cut an album that shoots through the charts.  In the meantime, Rob, who's now living in L.A. sorta takes a 3 year break and has an album that falls short in the charts....not short, just not what everyone expects after 6 blow-out albums.  Well, the other guys come to L.A. to cut an album and look up Rob. Now, this next thing is ONLY made in Fairy Tales! They make up and get back together as a fivesome again after 15 years!  Outside of the RoyalWedding this is the biggest event in the UK and beyond to Ireland, Germany, etc.  Now, after being the biggest Pop Star in Europe, Robbie Williams is part of Take That once again!  And, that's where this album comes into play.     The \\"boy\\" group that's now a \\"man\\" group have assembled a mature interesting album that is the biggest selling album of the millenium in Europe.  In fact Take That just won the 2011 Brit Award (their Grammy Award)for Best British Band!  A lot of the album is incredibly personal with lyrics describing the break up, the pain, the forgiveness, etc.  However, it's also rich in musicianship and the 5 of them together create a wonderful vocal sound.  It's not too often we get songs anymore where the lyrics are heard and felt.  This is what has made Robbie Williams famous. His lyrics are full of emotion, doubt, loneliness, and self-loathing. On this album Rob has to share the limelight, however, he's featured on a number of the songs. His soulful, rock sound brings depth and clarity to the album. However, all the members have their own unique talent.  Gary Barlow with his sweet melodic voice is, also, a wonderful songwriter.  Mark Owen brings a vulnerability and a very English sound to the album.  Jason Orange and Howard Donald round out the voices so that the harmonizing is perfectly balanced.  Lots of production in this album....don't think bubble gum...it ain't.  Far from it!  From Boy Band to a mature, lived in talented group of guys, this album will make you wonder why you never heard of them in the first place.  Of course, the only reason I bought the album was for Robbie Williams (who is, by far, the most charismatic of the group) but, I have to say, the five of them together have created an album you'll want to hear over and over again. Discover what Europe is raving about!  Go get it!      Btw...TAKE THAT starts their European tour May 27, 2011. I'll be there at Wembley Stadium in London May 30th! It's the only way to see Robbie Williamseven though I live in L.A., as well.
B001FBSLH2|4.0|I really enjoyed watching this concert, the musicianship is great and I loved the songs. The sound quality is really good, the video quality was ok, it could have been better only because it is a little dark. Overall great video, I would recommend it.
B001A5HBJC|2.0|Just another TV soap opera, this time with narrow ties and lots of cigarettes and booze. Poor writing, unbelievable characters, (especially the women), and a totally predictable plot. Watched one, that's one too many. Save your money and your time.     For a great TV series, watch Treme.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|I originally streamed this film on Netflix, and loved it so much, I bought the BluRay. This is the classiest foreign film I have seen in quite some time. The look is perfect, the performances understated, the effects powerful without being overwrought. Though its principal performers are adolescents, this is a film more likely to be appreciated by adults. American filmmakers don't seem to know how to make a properly evocative horror thriller like this one (although I hear the American version of this one is quite good). My only complaint is its lack of a commentary track, and the all-too-short behind-the-scenes feature. Overall, a terrific movie for the price.

B0042J6VUS|4.0|The tripod stand appears to be pretty sturdy and durable, but I'm not sure about the telephone holder for my Samsung Galaxy Fascinate.

0743420373|5.0|This is the best book I've found so far, perhaps along with the fable \\"The Richest Man in Babylon\\", to set people people straight about wasteful spending and chasing empty image.  The anecdote that starts off the book, about the non-millionaire dressed to the nines with his Rolex watch looking out over the plain-dressed folk millionaires who do NOT want caviar and champagne, speaks volumes in itself.  Media in America makes \\"bling\\" the signal of riches... when indeed it is really the antithesis.    Read this book for some common-sense insight into what the vast majority of real American millionaires are like.  (Celebrities are only a tiny, tiny slice of reality ... and many of them are going broke, if you'll notice.)
0439023513|3.0|Not a bad book, but this wasn't the wrap up I'd hoped for. I think other reviewers have said it very eloquently already, but this book was about the horrors of war and not much else. It reminded me very much of a (true) book I recently read about a boy surviving a Nazi death camp (hunger, hopelessness, utter tyranny, constant fear, pointless death). The silver lining in most war stories are the characters who endure and triumph. I kept waiting for Katniss to shine, not literally via help from her prep team (that at least was accomplished), but to really mature and come into her own power and make her own decisions. Instead she hides. While I try to remind myself that's she's still a child I can't help but want more out of the girl who stepped up to save her little sister in the first book and fell in love with Peeta in the second. I wanted bravery and passion. We get neither. (Some spoilers ahead).     Looking at the other characters, I was delighted with Finnick in book 2, but was disheartened to find in 3 he was \\"broken\\". Just when he seemed whole again he suddenly (literally) wasn't, making for a very trivial passing. Peeta, my favorite character in the first 2 books was barely himself. It was like he died at the end of book 2. I kept hoping that Katniss would find a way to reach him, but she barely tried. Her giving up so easily on someone she previously tried so hard to save was unsettling to me. Also unsettling was Gale, who was willing to sacrifice so much for his family and friends, but who betrayed his own nature by becoming calculating and cold. I suspect he was made abhorrent so that Katniss could avoid having to choose between him and Peeta. One bright spot was Prim's transformation into the girl I'd hoped Katniss would have become, strong, self-assured, purposeful, insightful and passionate. Sadly it really is only a \\"spot\\" because Prim once again is left with only a handful of dialog. Still, having become such a strong character she's an odd choice forthe sacrificial lamb. I expected a more noble purpose.     Aside from the characters I was disappointed with how often drugs and alcohol were used as an escape. It provided a bit of dark humor in book 1 when Katniss and Peeta had to deal with Haymitch's habit, but by book 2, specifically with the morphling addicts, it was very clear that this form of escape leaves one pathetic and helpless (and dead). So by the 3rd book I was shocked that everyone was hooked on \\"morphling\\" and no one seemed to care about the effects. Injuries aside, I'd like to be awake when I'm fighting for... err... what were they fighting for? Personal agendas, revenge, power...     I guess in the end everything turned out OK, seemingly by chance, since the final mission was not completed. (Later President Snow coughs himself to death, really?) The few people left alive ended up back where they belong, again by chance.     Finally there's the epilogue, where I was annoyed that they bothered to age Katniss when we never really got to see her mature. I would have rather thought that perhaps she did grow up to become what I'd hoped instead of being assured that she did not.     If I had to sum it up in one word I would go with \\"Harsh\\". Still, Collins is an excellent writer. I blame much of my disappointment with the fact that I felt the books leading in a very different direction, and the 3rd book is just so hard to reconcile against the first two.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|There's not a single track I skip past on this album.  Little Lion Man is without a doubt my favorite, but I enjoy every single song on this album.  If I don't know what to listen to, I will almost *always* put this excellent collection on the \\"Now Playing\\" table.<br /><br />Mumford and Sons bring a sense of passion about their music much like Glen Hansard's passion for The Frames and The Swell Season.  It's a rare thing to hear music this good, so I suggest you add this to your repertoire now.  You'll constantly be coming back for more Mumford goodness.

B004RC8NUQ|4.0|Can you really ever be just \\"friends with benefits\\"?  After a drunken adventure ends with Adam (Kutcher) naked on Emma's (Portman) couch they decide to strike a deal.  When Adam wants something more the problems begin.  This is a chick flick that many guys will also enjoy.  A little more girlie then I was expecting, but still a really, really funny movie.  The movie is pretty raunchy in some parts and you will find it difficult not to laugh.  If you are looking for a chick flick that your boyfriend/husband will watch with you this is a great choice.  If you are looking for a movie for your girlfriend/wife that will not be two hours of torture for you this is a great choice.  Very, very funny for both sexes, enough romance for the ladies, and enough comedy for the men.  A perfect movie for date night.  A little predictable, but most romantic comedies are.  I give it a B+.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - I actually would.<br /><br />*Also try - Going The Distance & Love And Other Drugs
B002TZS5GU|3.0|As far as horror movies go (if you even consider this a horror movie) this takes a less hysterical approach and tries harder to dive into the hearts of people.    Here's the scoop. Some disease has wiped out most of the human race. The rest are either dying or trying not to become infected. Two brothers are trying to make their way, along with their female companions, back to 'Turtle Beach', the one place of which they have fond memories and a place that might make them feel safe.    The road is bumpy. Every person whose path they cross might be infected or might be hostile. Gas is in real short supply as is food and water. They do keep an ear to the radio for any broadcast that might offer some ray of hope, but they're doubtful. How far will they go? What will they do in order to survive? Their morals and good will are all put to the test in a series of encounters and none of them are pretty.    On the good side, the performances by all the leads are decent. You'll probably recognize many of the faces if not the names themselves. The situations are tense but not overly so. The writers/directors do a decent job of keeping things from getting too Hollywood. The production values, music, etc. are all good enough.    On the bad side, this needed something else. Something more. What these people experience and the decisions they need to make are pretty horrible. And though many of the scenes do pretty well in conveying this somehow, at the end of the day, I felt as though something were missing. The ending, particularly, felt a bit flat. Not really bad, but just a bit short.    This is not at all a bad watch, and at 84 minutes it won't try your patience. If you're into this sort of thing, there are worse ways to spend your time.

B004X0Y8LU|5.0|This is the third album from the Kendal wonders, Wild Beasts, who are by far the best British band of the past three years. \\"Smother\\" is an album that is so different from its predecessor, the ostentation of \\"Two Dancers\\" is reigned in and the brazenness pulled back. Guitars are noticeable by their absence and in come elegant sweeping synths, combined with deep seductive melodies and sophisticated soundscapes. This album draws more on Talk Talk of the era of \\"New Grass\\" than it does the Smiths, which was \\"Two Dancers\\" primary source. Undoubtedly some will be completely alienated or find this a very slow burner that appears underwhelming with its lack of hedonism. Alternatively others who carefully listen will hear one of the most strikingly attractive albums produced by any rock band in recent times. At the core of this is the vocal partnership of Hayden Thorpe and Tom Fleming that has developed into one of music's great double acts. Thorpe's wonderfully contained falsetto reminds you on times of Anthony Hegarty but on \\"Smother\\" his performance is matched by Fleming's deeper and richer bass voice. Both sing on the sumptuous opener \\"Lion's share\\" which starts with a huge pulsating synth and Thorpe announcing, \\"I find you hid in mirrorville/creature of the deep/waifish as a widow/and without sufficient sleep\\". It is complimented by a rolling piano, all sorts of studio trickery and is an absolute sultry joy of a song. Next up is the most immediate and commercial song on the album \\"Bed of Nails\\" which could have appeared on Fever Ray's recent pop epic. Fleming takes the lead on the \\"Deeper\\" and it is one of the albums standouts with slow and refrained piece of minimalist funk. Guitars finally make an appearance on \\"Loop the loop\\" but as a melodic backdrop to a swelling song of real warmth and beauty (there is not one guitar solo on the whole album). \\"Plaything\\" reminds you of some of the preoccupations of James Blake with its electro atmospherics and emphasis on manipulating tension.<br /><br />Fleming takes the helm again for \\"Invisible\\" a much grander beast than \\"Deeper\\" and it is followed by the single \\"Albatross\\" which sees Thorpe at his most operatic on a song of undulating wonder. The last three tracks are led by \\"Reach a bit further\\" possibly the weakest song on the album. But the menacing \\"Burning\\" which Fleming infuses with the ghostly aura of David Sylvain's \\"Ghosts\\" brilliantly compensates this. Finally comes the best song on the album the near eight minute \\"End come to soon\\" a sensual erotic synth epic where Thorpe alludes at one point to someone \\"Whose butter-fingers rip me like bread/Whose dirty mouth would have me merry head\\". The song gently fades in its mid section but returns with a vengeance at around 5.50 minutes marking a triumphant end to the album. \\"Smother\\" also manages to leave off the album the deeply slow and gentle title track, which frankly is a bit odd (it's the B side to Albatross), but it shows a band with songs and talent to spare. This third album represents a journey so far-flung from the \\"Brave, bulging, buoyant, clairvoyants\\" of their debut \\"Limbo Panto\\" as to make that sound like a very distant relative. As it stands this exquisite album confirms the Wild Beasts as the main and extraordinary contenders for the crown of British music.ating tension.

0670022411|4.0|I thought this was a very interesting interpretation on the concept of witches, vampires and demons.  I wish someone would have warned me that it is the first book in what is likely to be some type of series.  I felt very disappointed with the ending, but also looking forward to the next book - whenever that will be.  Written well and characters were developed along with an interesting story.
B0000027RL|5.0|First things first.  Forget what the music history books tell you.  Pearl Jam is NOT Grunge.  Never was, they are not grunge now, and they never will be.  True, two of their members were in the seminal grunge band Green River, but like many bands who were contributed to the humble Seattle scene, quickly outgrew the grunge sound or just simply wanted to make awesome, new types of music using their diverse tastes and influences.  There's a reason why so many Listen to Mother Love Bone and don't tell me that was crucial to the development of Pearl Jam's sound on Ten.  Heck, even Nevermind by Nirvana was made as an attempt to, get this, ACTUALLY MOVE AWAY FROM CONFINES OF THE SEATTLE GRUNGE SCENE!!! (how much do you want to bet?) Goes to show you that you can't always trust the dumb@$$ press or the idiots they spawn.<br /><br />That said, Pearl Jam's Ten is a classic, and even today, sounds very unique yet at the same time drawing influences from a ton of different bands, their most prominent influences being hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin and The Who, mixed with tons of anthem-worthy choruses and ripping guitar hero antics, and an almost punk rock type of energy to their performances.  Ten is their most accessible album, as later albums would  become much more thematically complex and with more (yeah, I'm echoing the amazon reviewer a bit) ambitious melding of different musical influences.  Ten, in my opinion, is easily a debut that's hard to top for a band like this.<br /><br />As a band, Pearl Jam pretty much showed the world that many of these bands from Seattle could certainly play their instruments with both emotion and technical accomplishment.  Guitarists Mike McCready and Stone Gossard are two fine guitarists, pulling off extremely melodic, tight, and in your face guitar riffs and solos.  Mike, in particular, is fantastic, mixing extremely melodic and tuneful guitar work with fretboard firing that recalls SRV, and Stone Gossard provides tight rhythm underneath, effectively earning the title \\"Four armed monster\\".  Listen to the way the band rips into howling guitar rings in Even Flow, or those And of course, there's the iconic Eddie Vedder, with his low, majestic \\"Golden Baritone\\" that would become one of the most widely imitated vocal performances along with fellow Seattle singer Kurt Cobain.  Bassist Jeff Ament and drummer Dave Krusen do a great job backing up the guitar and vocal without sounding like a mere back up band.<br /><br />Lyrically, Pearl Jam's Ten can be quite dark, touching up on Suicide, Incest, Homelessness, and just plain old persona conflict.  However, there's always an undercurrent of hope and a sense of salvation and a meaning to solve one's problems, and of that prevents Pearl Jam's Ten from being a mope-fest that most people associate the genre with anyway (IE idiots who use the word \\"Grunge\\" in a serious light, especially concerning Pearl Jam).  I think that's one thing that makes this album highly worth listening to, and Pearl Jam in general.  I can't for the life of me understand where the Throughout the record Eddie Vedder sings and soars with sincere and caring emotion.  I mean, just look at what Eddie Vedder said about the meaning of Jeremy and what he wants you to get out of it:<br /><br />\\"It came from a small paragraph in a paper which means you kill yourself and you make a big old sacrifice and try to get your revenge. That all you're gonna end up with is a paragraph in a newspaper. Sixty-three degrees and cloudy in a suburban neighborhood. That's the beginning of the video and that's the same thing is that in the end, it does nothing ... nothing changes. The world goes on and you're gone. The best revenge is to live on and prove yourself. Be stronger than those people. And then you can come back.\\"<br /><br />Ten, as you can probably tell, is very consistent across the board.  Aside from the bland Garden, every track here is great.  You all know the hits here, and for good reason.  EvenFlow, the fiercest rocker on the album, features rip roaring guitar playing, a great chorus, and Eddie Vedder's soaring vocals.  Alive is an anthem for the ages, with an awesome chorus that makes you indeed thankful that you are alive and well.  Black is a slower, extremely melodic, and oceanic song that floats in a misty, moody, timeless atmosphere (it almost captures a pristine moment in time, for me anyway).  Watch out for that insane guitar solo at the end!  And Jeremy is an absolute essential anti-suicide anthem for the ages.<br /><br />Aside from the hits, there are plenty of other amazing songs as well.  Upbeat and melodic songs like Why Go, Once, Deep, and Porch feature more extremely intricate and tight guitar work, great vocals, amazingly melodic songwriting, and everything else that Even Flow hinted at when you first heard it.  Oceans is another song in the vein of Black, only, as the name hinted at, is composed of beautiful and oceanic guitars that come across in waves, washing over the listener that noisy, stilted, and awkward bands like Ride have never been able to achieve.  The closing, Release, is not quite as powerful as it should be, but there's no doubt you can hear what Vedder is trying to convey.  It ends with the extended oceanic intro at the end, that was featured at the beginning of Once.<br /><br />I can't give Ten a perfect score.  I never really cared for the track Garden (as I previously noted), and Pearl Jam's Ten doesn't quite come have the same emotional vitality and that Nirvana's Nevermind and (especially) Soundgarden's Badmotorfinger.  Personally, though, I have no idea why people are complaining about the production values; the album doesn't sound THAT commercial.  However, though, Ten, once I warmed up to it, found it, and quite inspiring and uplifting.  Like most of the stuff out of Seattle, this one is essential.  Also, listen to the Mother Love Bone collection and the Temple of the Dog album, which are also amazing.features rip roaring guitar playing, a great chorus, and Eddie Vedder's soaring vocals.

B0000VCZK2|5.0|I have been a fan of the Alien movies since they first came out and have several copies on VHS format. I've watched them so much, they are just about 'worn out'! I'm so glad I purchased Alien Quadrilogy! Not only can I watch the original versions of my favorite movies, but I got all these bonus features & added footage! Watching the Special Edition Alien3 was like watching an entirely different movie than the original. I loved it! The Alien movies have always left me wanting more and Alien Quad did not dissappoint! Fantastic movies, fantastic bonus discs!
B003F1WM2K|5.0|I was given this book as a gift and was engaged throughout the entire book.  I rarely have the attention or time to read for recreation (much more business/science related), but something about this book keep me wanting to read.  Patti Smith has a way of making this alien world (to me, at least) interesting and somewhat familiar.  For me, finding a book that kept my interest and was well written was truly a find.
B003EY7IUY|1.0|How is the kindle version more expensive than the paperback?  Its free to make and has no resale value.  What a rip off!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This cooler is big. It covers the the first RAM slot (MB: P67A-UD4-B3). My case has a cross-bar with a fan on it. I had to cut some material off the cross-bar in order to fit. Performance of this cooler is first class. CPU (i5 2500) runs at 40C at full load. The fan is very quiet. It's a great buy if it fits in your case.
096798467X|5.0|Kiko provides clear illustrations and simple, easy-to-follow instructions in gaining an understanding to construct an earth oven and baking sourdough bread.  His years of experience in sculpturing earth ovens provides inspiration to activate our creative hands and ideas to create a fully funtional and beautifully made art piece to be proud of.  Given I am a complete novice at both construction and sculpturing, Kiko gave me the confidence to be proud of something, I thought, was out of my reach.  If someone said to me that by building an earth oven it will change your outlook of life, I had to experience it to believe it, which now I have, it is true!  Beware that it is addictive book to read and reread.  Highly recommended!
B004G600A4|5.0|I'm a picky parent when it comes to what I'll let my child watch. Tangled was a huge hit--with both my daughter (who is almost 3) and myself...and my grandparents...and my parents...and the list goes on.  I loved the story, loved the music...and was so glad that unlike some more recent Disney movies, this had no content I found questionable. Fantastic film. Also bought the soundtrack!!!
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I have too many good things to say about this. I started w/this dev's App Organizer about 3 months ago, then moved to the free version of Folder Organizer (exporting my folder choices), then moved everything to this paid version. I paid slightly more than it is now but it was well worth it. I put dynamic folders on my home screens, and use those folders to organize without opening Folder Organizer; this saves tons of time. Icons are great. I tried GoToApp and Auto App Organizer, both of which were ok but, to me, they weren't as easy to use.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is one of very few albums I've heard lately on which EVERY SINGLE TRACK is worth listening to. The piano accompaniment, the arrangements, and the songwriting are all stellar. But the true star of this album is Adele's voice. Hearing her sing is like leaping from a cliff into a warm ocean. It terrifies and exhilarates at the same time. There is a sense of peace and tranqulity in the descending free fall and then a plunge into something wider, deeper, and more sublime than you have ever imagined. I completely agree with Beyonce, listening to Adele is like hearing the voice of God.
B003YBNREI|5.0|What Supernatural is to Santana is what this World Gone Crazy is to the Doobies. I rave about this album. The fact I am only a marginal Doobie fan, owning only a few of their albums, beleive me when I say this ablum is their Sgt. Pepper. What a huge surprise and what an incredible come back. Each tune is a 9 or 10. The entire album maintains a high note throughout their 11 songs. Wonderful! Clearly 5 STARS
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I loved this book...the story was engaging from the beginning. Keeping me reading until late into the night. I would recommmend this to anyone who loves fantasy with some romance.  Yes, it is about Witches, Vampires, and a forbidden love. I enjoyed it just the same.  Take a chance, I thought the author done a fabulous job with the characters.
0316069353|2.0|I was disappointed with this book. It starts well and the foreclosure story is topical but it drags once the case goes to trial and the twist at the ending doesn't make sense. Michael Connolly is one of my favourite writers but this book never really catches.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I've been using the gamepad for a while now and it works great. Very solid, it's definitely worth the money spent. With 22 G keys, the joystick, and 2 modifiers, I have more than enough room for all my actions in World of Warcraft. It does take some getting used to, but once you do, you'll love it.   The LCD screen works well too, but more of an added bonus, not a necessity. It comes with WoW support out of the box, so you can see your stats right when you log in. And when you join a PvP game, it'll show your kills deaths, HKs, and more.     When I got the pad, I was told to use the keys for movement and the joystick for menus and such. I tried that and was somewhat uncomfortable. I tried the joystick for movement and I LOVE it. It works just like on an Xbox or Playstation controller, not like a D-pad, so you can assign WASD to it and it works great. The big benefit to doing this is it opens up 4 keys AND 3 of your fingers to cast with! since I play mostly PvP, I'm constantly moving, and I'd need my fingers on WASD, so having just my thumb for movement gives my an advantage :).  My only complaint I have with the G13 is the button on the joystick. When you press down on the stick, it acts as another button, like a console controller. My problem with it is it is very difficult to press. I had it assigned to jump but pressing it over and over, it starts to hurt my thumb. If you want to assign an action to it, I'd recommend something not needed in a fight, such as the map or a mount.   My recommendation to everyone who uses this for an MMO, try assigning the joystick to movement, the G keys to your actions, and the two modifiers to menus. And if you need more buttons than the 22 provided, assign a button on your mouse to ctrl or alt for a modifier. (Middle button or extra side buttons if you have them)    To anyone looking at this for a FPS, I tried Call of Duty 4. It works but I personally like the Keyboard better, it just feels more natural. It took far more time adjusting to the layout than World of Warcraft did, but it is possible.      Overall, I think this product is a great investment for any gamer looking to improve their game. 5 stars

B002GNTDTI|1.0|I know Amazon doesn't set the price, so my beef isn't with them. This is aimed at the production company, etc...    So I don't get a DVD and I may loose the ability to stream if there is some type of licensing issue, but I get to pay almost full price for the series. You guys still don't get it.    I'll just buy it used and you get nothing.
B004I11VZ0|4.0|This movie looks great on Blu-Ray.  The film overall was pretty good but not as good as the first one.  The fights were still good and Donnie vs Hung can never get old when I watch it.  The only thing that hurt this film was that it tried to be like Rocky IV in the second half.  Other than that, I enjoyed it!
0783225725|5.0|my favorite movie, thanks to amazon and their vendors i was able to get it at a good price in great condition. would order from again anytime, great experience.
0307477479|1.0|I was struggling with this book from the beginning but because it's my this month's book club selection I made it to the end (after skipping most of the ridiculous 40 or so pages of \\"power point\\").  After reading the final page I asked \\"why, why, why\\"?  Why did she write it?  Why did she win the Pulitzer for it? And most of all, WHY DID I READ IT?
B004G5ZXVQ|3.0|i must be honest here ,I own every cd from murmur to adventures in hifi, but the cds following such as up, reveal so on, do not do it for me . ilove seeing them live because they play the old stuff sometimes. i personally feel the loss of the drummer bill berry affected the group in a negative way. but that is just my opinion. i still love rem, but not a fan of any of the new music. thank you condition was mint,arrived on time would order from again.

076115728X|5.0|This is a wonderful book that teaches a good lesson for young and old, more-or-less the old \\"take lemons and make lemonade\\".  The colors are vibrant and the interactive component is a lot of fun.  This is suitable for kids around 2 yrs and up as well as any adults (especially those with an artistic background.  Highly recommend.
B00005JMYI|5.0|Ron Burgundy is the funniest guy.  The Afternoon Delight song is the best, the flute scene is great, the scene where Jack Black kicked the dog is the funniest and the News Anchor Rumble is off the charts!! This movie gets a 2 thumbs up!!!

B004BJMEO6|5.0|Nicole Conn has written another great film.  I really enjoyed it from beginning to end.  This was a wonderful story.  It was great to see Sam Harris again as well..He still sounds great.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Actually, I didn't watch the movie in a theater. A friend of mine put a copy in my mobile. To begin with, I'm not at all a fan of cartoon or Animated stuff. I first though of deleting the content, then for my friends sake, I thought of watching it for a couple of minutes. The couple of minutes led to the whole movie. I even forgot I was staring at my mobile screen, not to mention holding it in one hand, for the full one and half hour. From then on, I watched the movie 9 times within a span of few weeks - each time in my mobile. Now I'm seriously considering to own the movie in Blu-ray. The plot/screenplay/quality/music/characters/comedy/sentiment and what not.... of the movie are so well graphed that it makes many of us give *****stars. I can surely say, whenever I feel upset, moody or bored, I'll think of watching this movie - - it makes you forget everything as long as it lasts. Great flick. From now, I'll keep an eye on animated movies as well for I don't want to miss any movie of this sort. Thanks to my friend.

0634086782|3.0|Pro:  This is a great book to build a solid knowledge of harmony. It goes from the basics of intervals through building chords and their roles in given keys. The book concludes with the task of voicings of chords. An excellent resource for anyone wanting to learn the inner workings of Jazz and music in general. The book has questions at the end of each chapter to reinforce the content covered; I have a Masters in Music and I went through this book cover to cover and did every question, I found that I became more proficient in the harmonic language by studying this text.  Con:  Unfortunately the one and only con is a biggie! Yes there are questions at the end of each chapter. As I worked out every answer to every question I noticed that there are mistakes in the answer section; at least 5. I emailed the publisher about this and was advised that they cannot be held accountable for printing mistakes. This is not acceptable from a book which is meant to teach a tough element of music. Calling something Mixolydian when it should be Lydian is not a printing error, it is downright poor.   Overall:  The content of the material delivered through the chapters is fantastic. It is broken down and build on throughout the book. I would be giving this book 10 stars out of 5 if there were no mistakes in the answer section but I can't give more than 3 stars when I know that someone who is coming to harmony for the first time could get stuck and become frustrated when they cannot understand why their answer does not match the one provided. Hopefully the publisher will take note and correct this for the next edition
B004GHNHVW|5.0|I love Paul Simon.  My favorite of his cd's is The Capeman, I still think one of these days, someone will bring it back to the stage.  This is a beautiful cd, every song can stand alone.  I don't have a favorite yet, but I'm loving it on my ipod!  He really is a poet, he says the most profound things in such a simple, clean way.
B000002LAC|3.0|Most critics don't have to listen to Cd's by Emmylou Harris to decide what rating to give her albums. Its just a given they will say they love it no matter what. It's not that she isn't good it's just that I don't get the love affair critics have with her. What makes a good album is not as complicated as critics pretend. It doesn't have to be deep and it doesn't have to be commercial. Simply put, you know it's a great CD when you want to play it over and over. Trio may technically be excellent but I doubt that most buyers will get this one out and play it over and over. It just doesn't have \\"it\\". The harmonies are excellent here. Each lady takes the lead on three songs while the other 2 provide the background vocals. The song choices are a mixed bag. Songs with Dolly on the lead are excellent. Both \\"Those Memories of You\\" & \\"Wildflowers\\" are great songs and will make you believe all the hype about the CD. I would give the Dolly tracks 5 stars. The Emmylou songs are good but kinda boring. \\"My Dear Companion\\" is excellent but the other 2 are just so so. I would give these 4 stars. The Linda tracks are very poor song choices and you also don't really hear the harmonizing on these tracks. Her vocal is strong but once you have heard them once you'll be done. I would give the Linda tracks 2 stars. I am not trying to say that the hype about these 3 voices is overrated but great harmonizing alone doesn't make for a great album. It needs to be backed up with great songs and for the most part it fails to do so. People are told this is one of the greatest ever so people just seem to fall inline and agree. But, in my opinion I'd bet that most fans will keep reaching for the better solo albums of these ladies and I doubt that this one get put into their CD players too often.

B00005JLEU|5.0|This has got to be one of my favorite Miyazaki films. Spirited Away tells the story of Chihiro, a young girl who gets trapped in bathhouse run by spirits and must rescue her parents (who in true Miyazaki fashion, have been transformed into pigs) before she can escape. The only one who can help her, Haku, is the one she cannot trust.     This beautiful masterpiece is a reflection of Japan. Chihiro's relationship with her parents comments on the struggle between the upcoming generation and that of the 60's and 70's during a time of economic downturn. The film also explores greed and corruption, and the destruction that naturally results from it. The spirit No Face tries to seduce Chihiro into taking his gold, but she refuses because she is trying to save Haku. We see the importance of not relying on appearances to shape our understanding of someone. Yubaba's twin sister, although just as ugly as her mean-spirited sister, is kind and recognizes the importance of friendship and love. Although Chihiro's name has been stolen by Yubaba, she still finds her identity and succeeds in surviving the danger she has been thrust into, an unexpected commentary on Japan's identity.     This film easily deserves the 2003 Academy Award it won for best animated film. Although sometimes strange and confusing, the story is worth watching and worth reflecting on, even if you have to watch it more than once to understand it.

I can now easily locate apps by category as oppose to looking through multiple screens and\or the app drawer.  Easily create folders for most-often called or contacted as well as links to the web.  The more you delve into it the more powerful you realize it can be.  Worth every penny!

0670022411|1.0|I wanted to like this book, I really did but I just couldn't. So many others have stated their reasons for disliking the book & I have to say my reasons are pretty much the same. The story is so slow, it goes nowhere. Our 2 main characters are weak, cliche & boring. When I read the synopsis of the novel I thought it sounded so interesting & the fact that it was longer was a plus too. Sadly I found myself skimming a lot, trying to get to the meat of the story. How many times are we supposed to read about the heroine (and I use the term loosely) going to yoga, napping, having toast & tea, going rowing, describe her boring wardrobe, etc? Not to mention that she is a very weak willed, immature lead character.<br /><br />As for the \\"love story\\" I haven't read a book before where the people have had less chemistry than this. We're never given any real reasons why Diana & Matthew love eachother or why they date. Dry, passionless and yawn inducing is how I would describe their romance.<br /><br />Apparently this is the first book in a trilogy & seeing as I had to force my way through this one I doubt I'll be reading the other 2. The story is left open & unresolved but frankly I couldn't care less.<br /><br />Don't waste any time or money on this book.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|And so begins the summer; not with a whimper, but with a bang. Yes, Kenneth Branagh's super-hero epic has arrived, and it's... really quite good, actually, provided you just put your brain into neutral and let the sheer energy of it all roll over you.    The story tells the tale of Thor (Chris Hemsworth, who is certainly not the worst-looking man ever filmed), a young Asgardian about to be made heir to the throne by his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins). In the background his younger brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston, who looks very familiar despite my not having seen him in anything before), seethes with jealousy. During the ceremony to invest Thor with his titles, the Frost Giants attack, trying to steal a device that was taken from them after the last war between Jotunheim and Asgard. They're stopped, but Thor vows revenge. He rounds up his friends, crosses Bifrost, the Rainbow Bridge, and launches an ill-fated attack. In the end, war is declared and Odin, who had hoped to maintain peace, is forced to send his son into exile on Earth.    Now that story alone could have made for an interesting film, but that's only the first act. After arriving on Earth, Thor meets up with an astrophysicist (Natale Portman, whose own scientific background lends her credibility to this role). He's lost his powers and lost his way. The two quickly bond and, well, you know where that's heading. Meantime, SHIELD is investigating a mysterious, unmovable hammer that seems to have dropped out of the sky and hit the ground hard in New Mexico...    Like I said, I really enjoyed this movie. There's quite a lot of humor, lots of action and wonderful acting. Idris Elba, who plays Heimdal, is the real revelation here, as he does an exceptional job in what's really a fairly small role. The story also does an excellent job incorporating the various elements of Norse mythology. As both a super hero fan and a mythology fan, I really appreciated seeing the version of Asgard that was put up onto the screen.    I must say, aside from some of the overall silliness of the story, I can't find much anything to complain about, though the movie seems to sort of just stop rather than actually end. It was wildly entertaining and the brief appearances by the likes of Hawkeye and Nick Fury, both of them there to help set up next year's Avengers film, were enough to make the fanboy in me make all sorts of happy noises. I really cannot recommend this movie enough, and if this is what the other summer super hero movies have in store for us, well, we're set for a great summer!
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Ear buds and their ilk have been around since I was in junior high.  Even though they're tiny and portable, I've never had much use for them since they always fall out, itch or hurt and, generally, sound like crap.  Truthfully, once my audiophile aunt introduced me to what a proper set of headphones looked and sounded like, anything smaller than Princess Leia's pinned-up hair became a horrible waste of magnets and foam for which I had no use outside of the gym.  While the side effect of having a jones for good headphones is a thinner wallet, it's ameliorated by the fact that they last longer, sound much better and are way harder to leave in the back seat pocket of an airplane.Unlike marijuana, your first set of good headphones are a gateway drug.  They lead to research jags about optical versus SP/DIF, receiver/amplifier fade over time and eventually, the Big (five point) One: Dolby.<br /><br />Before I went to grad school, I conned my dad into paying for a really nice computer complete with a Sound Blaster LIVE! with included 5.1 speakers because he has the technical literacy of Ted Stephens.  Fast forward six years and I've got a 5.1 system on my PC and another one for my TV/XBox360/Blu-Ray player. I thought about upgrading to 7.1, but some buddies who get paid to know about audio stuff convinced me that it's not worth the money (or hassle of re-burying speaker wire) to replace the system I've already got.  However, a friend of mine did the equivalent of waving a Scooby Snack under the nose of a cowering Scooby Doo - he let me know that he had bought a new headset/mic setup.  Like an obsessive-compulsive squirrel checking and re-checking that the nut he just buried was still in its location, I began researching the field of Really Good Headsets (That, Oh, By the Way, Can Come With Surround Sound Authorized By Dolby Labs).  I was so screwed.<br /><br />The results of my research led me to the EarForce X41: Turtle Beach's top-of-the-line headset designed specifically for the XBox 360.  2.4 GHz RF Wireless with optical-in and optical-out ports (in case your XBox is pulling double duty as your media center) along with more product specifications than is really necessary, these babies looked sweet.  This wasn't the result of an impulse purchase, either - after pricing, review-reading and debating whether 7.1 was an actual selling point for me or not, I still picked the X41.  (For the curious: wired/wireless was not a big driver in my decision and neither was 5.1 versus 7.1 - prior to purchase, I was most interested in the comfort, the sound reproduction and their substantialness.  I wasn't planning on boxing in them, but I didn't want a piece of lightweight plastic crap, either).<br /><br />I got them on roughly three months ago and I haven't interrupted my dog's nap time with gunfire and explosions since. Out of the box, the X41's had enough heft that they didn't feel like adjusting them was going to cause them to snap, but they weren't heavy in a way that made me worry about neck fatigue, either.  Aside from a gashed finger from the heat-sealed plastic package, set-up was surprisingly easy - the RF transmitter is powered via USB, and both batteries (!) and an optical cable were included (Note: I may replace it with a higher quality one later since, unlike RCA's, optical cable quality does matter to an extent).  The headphone/mic itself took two AAA batteries; when the included ones wear out, I'll dispose of them properly at Best Buy and replace them with RayoVac rechargeables. Since I put the X41's on, I began to realize why they won XBOX Magazine's peripheral of the year.  Even before firing up Bulletstorm and Gears of War 2, the comfort level of the ear cups and head band was so high that I probably would have been willing to overlook so-so sound.<br /><br />Following a little tweaking with the volume level control, however, they sounded fantastic. I was almost disappointed that my first experience with them was on Bulletstorm; while the one-liners were entertaining, it took Gears of War 2 to really let them show off that a pair of headphones was perfectly capable of producing sound worthy of the Dolby Labs stamp.  (To be fair to Dolby, they don't exactly hand that bad boy out).  Low-end bass has always been the problem with headphones but lemme tell ya' what, folks - unless you were listening to opera where the kettle drum is being played very quietly, my experience with the X41's led me to believe that that particular issue, especially with the bass-boost effect, would never be a problem for me.  I've even popped out the mic and used them to watch HD movies with surround streamed from the Zune store and they don't disappoint. Although sometimes it's nice to rattle the windows and feel explosions, other times it's better to put on the headphones and let your girlfriend sleep. On top of great range, the mic for the X41 has independently adjustable volume and a background-noise-cancelling function so that you can hear your teammates during a crazy firefight. I've got a pair of Sennheiser HD555s so, let me put it this way: the X41 is completely comparable to a professional-grade headphone AND it has 7.1 surround.<br /><br />This isn't a total love-fest, though.  The X41's have two weak points that keep me from handing them a 5/5 rating: the ear-cup closure and RF interference.  When it comes to good headphones, there's a little more to it than just sticking an \\"R\\" and \\"L\\" on the ear-cups - the actual speaker aperture needs to be a little oblong and the foam casing around it that seals your ear in should follow that design.  If it doesn't, it leaves a gap below your earlobe.  I'm not certain that this leads to any significant \\"sound leakage,\\" but it definitely makes the ear-cup feel a little less secure. I found it a little disconcerting, as if they might have flown off if I turned my head too fast.  (That hasn't happened - if I had to guess, I think it's a perceptual thing rather than a real concern.)<br /><br />The other issue I have is with RF interference. The only person who uses wireless in my place is my girlfriend (I've got an issue with my data floating around in the air instead of down hardlines), I do have a wireless router. I was worried about popping due to interference and it is an issue. I solved it by shutting down my wireless router, but if someone's using it, particularly if the transmission power is cranked to make the range as high as possible, it WILL interfere with the transmission to your headphones. Your smart phone will also cause some minor interference when you get a call coming in or a text message, but it's small enough to be nearly unnoticeable. I have an older \\"g\\" class wireless router, so maybe those of you with routers that put out more EM energy would notice even more interference (or maybe less?) Although using BlueTooth might have avoided interference issues, it would have created new ones with battery drain, so I'm okay with Turtle Beach's decision on this one.<br /><br />PERSONALLY SURROUNDED<br /><br />Final verdict?  If you're willing to part with a decent amount of cash, the X41 is totally worth it; if you don't have a surround system set up and you're not ready for that big of an audio investment in time and money but you're still interested in having the tech, I'd think the X41 might be something worthwhile looking into as well.entertaining, it took Gears of War 2 to really let them show off that a pair of headphones was perfectly capable of producing sound worthy of the Dolby Labs stamp.

B001202VJU|5.0|The Arise and Beneath albums were Sepultura at their peak of greatness!  In Chaos A.D. they had a couple of good songs, but that is when they slowed down, and in my opinion, every record after that does not have the feel as the past two mentioned.  Is OK they wanted it a new direction, but definitely not as moving, grooving and pounding... Have you seen their DVD Live Under Siege in Spain? Absolutly brutal from beginning to end!
B003VS0CWO|5.0|Until the inevitable 50th anniversary edition comes out this is as good as it gets, with cues for when to use your props, some of the older (but pretty universal) call-backs a trivia track, interviews with the actors, a video of the casting calls made for the shadowcast you can access and run on your tv with PiP mode, still photo gallery, a look back at where it all began.....and on and on.  Also the Blu-ray disk comes packaged in a book that adds a little more of a collectible feel to it.          If you are a Rocky Horror fan this is a must have.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I heard a live cover of \\"Little Lion Man\\" at a bar about a month ago. The song stuck out from the noise and I immediately had to know who the original artist was.  I listened to samples of this album and ended up purchasing the whole thing. I am not usually the kind of person who enjoys every song off of any album but I can't find a single track on this one that isn't brilliant.  I love the use of quotes from Shakespeare in \\"Sigh No More\\" and \\"Roll Out Your Stone\\" and the beautiful melodies of \\"Timshel\\" and \\"After the Storm\\".  Excellent use of banjo for a folky sound without being bluegrass.<br />My only complaint is the lack of a radio edit version of \\"Little Lion Man\\".  The dropping of the f-bomb in every chorus is a bit jarring and I wish I had the option of listening to the radio version instead.<br />Overall, I'm very pleased with this album and the discovery of this wonderful new band.

B002ZG99QS|4.0|LETS GET THE NEGATIVE OUT OF THE WAY FIRST. THE MOVIE ASSUMES THE VIEWER HAS SEEN AND REMEMBERS THE FIRST TRON, MAKING IT A  LITTLE LESS intresting for the younger audience. But, they are more than  compensated with the high speed racing and other super graphics. What the CPU erases it can restore too. So a third TRON is more than possible. How much do they have to make to make it worth their while?
B0010AN7Z4|2.0|I'm VERY disappointed with this product, because I was misled about the FORMAT as listed in the product information. I first considered ordering the \\"Regular\\" DVD, but decided not to do so because the format was listed as \\"Widescreen\\" which I don't use. The \\"Collector's\\" edition did NOT indicate widescreen - I only learned that AFTER I received the product and read the packaging. Had I known this information earlier, I would definitely NOT have ordered this DVD!
B004FRX0MY|3.0|I love the idea of this app and the cloud player. But, it pauses whenever a notification plays. I get tons of email, so this is obnoxious. I have to press play every time an email comes in. I'm on song 6 of an album right now and I promise I have had to restart it 20 times. This can never be my main player until fixed.
1586487981|3.0|One thing I felt missing was not including a rich country (US, for instance) on the tables, so it will give us a reference value of \\"how much\\" are they poor or rich.    Another thing is that I suspect (!?!) the poor constitutes a natural reserve to the capital when there is no more room for growth in the local rich economies, based on the physical increasing in the number of consumers. This way it seems that the poor is necessary, somehow, to the health of capitalism.     I keep wondering if everybody had the same amount of resources, same education level (the highest possible, of course), same access to information and decision power, how would our actual system thrive. Would it fare better or not? If we think \\"not\\", means we will never pursue equal progress and will actually try to derail other efforts to do so. If we think we should \\"not\\" be that way, same conclusion apply. However, if we think it would be better, then what economic directions (investments) should we take: same as we actually do (how good are they on this regard?!?!?) or to a different path?    It seems people hates competition in general, from politicians to business men. A proof of this is that corruption thrives the most in poor countries, where inequalities are more acute (I am referring to just what comes out in the press, not the real world as wikileaks suggests!). So, in this environment, it means opportunities are not shared to everybody in equal levels.    I understand there are efforts here and there on alleviating the poor hardship. However, how significant is this effort in general, as compared to the amount of willingness necessary to tackle it head on??? I have no figures on this regard, though I suspect very little, because poverty have been around us from a long, long time, isn't it?
B0018PH3L0|5.0|I saw Lonesome Dove when it first aired on TV in about 1989 and enjoyed it as much as any TV event I'd seen.  When I saw that Lonesome Dove had recently been upgraded to widescreen and remastered, I got it.  They did a good job on the remaster, most of the images are much clearer, although some of the lower light night scenes are still 'grainy'.  The wide screen image is awesome!  I'm using an upconverting DVD player to a 720p 32 inch TV and it looks as good as most movies. Also, the sound has been remixed in 5.1 surround.        Some reviewers are reviewing an edited shorter version.  This is the original 373 minute version, the original miniseries on 2 DVDs.  Each DVD contains 2 episodes about 1 and 1/2 hours each.  There are also some bonus features included, which includes a new interview with director Simon Wincer who explains this new updated version.  He says Lonesome Dove was shot on film so the upgrade was possible.  He also talks about showing the original film version to critics and VIPS in a movie theater!     I also notice a few people are giving the movie as a whole negative reviews.  That's OK, but if you've never watched Lonesome Dove, don't let a couple of naysayers keep you away.  This is a great film with a great story, great actors playing great characters, and great scenery.

B002KVSJ64|5.0|I have been a big fan of BB for many years. I love all of their albums. They have their own distinct sound and they bring amazing lyrics to their songs. In my opinion this ablum is their best so far.     Dear Agony is still the same Breaking Benjamin, but it has a different sound and tone than that of the other albums like Saturate, or We are not alone. (Which I highly recomend BTW) The songs in this album bring a very heartfelt and somber atmosphere yet they provide a sort of solace. The lyrics in this album are very touching and it sounds just magnificent! I highly recomend this CD.    My favorite songs in this album would be; \\"I will not bow,\\" \\"Fade Away,\\" and \\"Lights out.\\"

B000PMLFRA|1.0|A few days ago, the overall rating for this was 2 stars. There have been nothing but one star reviews since then. Now, all of a sudden, it's up to 3 and a half, even though 99% of the reviews are one star due to Lucas' stubbornness. Looks like Lucas' goons are at it again.
0756665949|5.0|This is a really cool book for Lost Fans, just answers to lots of questions, little tie-ins through the whole series that are fun to know. You see how the writers may have been thinking. Came brand new for me, very nice.
B0041KKYEW|4.0|Alright, I know it's about ballot, but I thought there would be *less* ballot. Kind of like there were baseball games in \\"Field of Dreams.\\" Know what I mean? But, excellent acting and a mind-bending storyline makes this a great movie. Visuals were odd in the Blu-Ray. Some parts looked grainy, others did not. I couldn't tell if it was meant to be like that. For that, I would recommend the DVD and not the higher priced Blu-Ray.
B00000G3I2|2.0|I can recall for years hearing about \\"The Big Chill\\".  That it was an amazing movie and the critical acclaim did nothing but support this honor.  Being a fan of cinema and a bit of a movie buff I finally decided last night to watch the movie.  The only thing I knew about the flick was it was an ensemble piece, had fine actors and actresses and all of Kevin Costner's scenes were deleted.  After I watched this movie I felt rather quizzical.  Not really sure what I had just watched for an hour and forty-five minutes.  I am sure I will be under fire for what I am about to say, but here goes nothing.<br /><br />The plot is simple, a bunch of college friends reunite after many years apart.  Which sounds nice, but the catalyst of this \\"homecoming\\" was the suicide of their mutual friend Alex (the deleted Kevin Costner).  All of these college friends, now adults spend the weekend together to catch up on old and new times.  Sounds interesting right? Not so much.<br /><br />These are some of the most one dimensional and superficial people I have ever seen in a movie.  In some ways this is a good and bad thing, good in the sense that the acting in this movie is actually pretty good.  It was bad in the sense that I had no real investment in anyone nor did I care what happened to these characters.<br /><br />Sam (Tom Berenger): Has become a famous TV star and plays a poor man's Magnum, P.I.; despite his fame he feels empty and not sure if he is \\"making a difference with his life\\".<br /><br />Harold (Kevin Kline): Married to Sarah and is hosting the weekend get together.  He is a rather successful sales man in the sneaker business. He likes his friends, but is somewhat put off that they are staying at his house.<br /><br />Sarah (Glenn Close): Married to Harold and had an affair with Alex years prior.  She also seems to have reservations about opening so many doors to the past.<br /><br />Michael (Jeff Goldblum): Is a famous journalist yet has desires to open a night club.  He acts like a real \\"player\\" but comes off as a dork who tells really bad jokes.<br /><br />Nick (William Hurt): Is an angry boy trapped in a man's body. He uses myriad controlled substance through out the film and \\"can't get it up\\". It seems he is pissed at Alex for committing suicide before he could.<br /><br />Chloe (Meg Tilly): She was Alex's girlfriend up to the day he died and never really offered any insight about Alex's current state of affairs.  She spends a great deal of time stretching and doing yoga via putting her legs over her head. Her best quality is to act rather vapid.<br /><br />Karen (JoBeth Williams): She purposely married a man who is the polar opposite of her father and is miserable. However, her husband is rich so it is all good, right? Wrong she is totally smitten with Sam and is chasing him the entire film...<br /><br />Meg (Mary Kay Place): Hasn't had much luck with men, in her late 30s she is still single and wants to have a child.  She has a plan to have one of the men at the weekend party get her pregnant.  The way this story line plays out is really CREEPY!!!<br /><br />As for their relationship with the estranged Alex, no one ever really spoke about how his death influenced them.  It would be addressed and then dropped.  The character of Alex was nothing more than a plot device, which is fine, but to keep bringing up \\"how they felt\\" and not concentrate on it made the entire notion seem rather shop worn and dull.<br /><br />On to the weekend itself all of these people spent together.  I am not sure about anyone else who watched this movie, but this seemed like the longest weekend in the world.  The last time I checked, there was only two days in the weekend.  This super weekend leaves the door open to the issues of sex, politics, philosophy, idealism and the meaning of life.  Again some spicy stuff, yet the execution, rather the writing was very lackluster and slow moving.  So here is the equation, poor writing plus unsympathetic charactersequals \\"I don't care\\".<br /><br />The movie only had a middle, no real beginning and no real end.  I am cool with that, because that is what life is in many ways.  This movie nailed that on the head.  However, the middle was just empty.  I began to question who had really committed suicide. As for the soundtrack, yeah there were some good tunes and most of them were played at very odd times.  For instance, everyone drives to the graveyard to bury their friend and jovial tunes of 1960s cascade in the background.  Huh?<br /><br />I honestly believe that this movie was a sign of the times and a period piece.  I was six years old when this movie was released.  Perhaps if I were 30 something when this was came out I might have loved it.  Notwithstanding, technology in modern times has made keeping in touch much easier.  Ultimately the acting is good but had its determents and the location shots in Beaufort, South Carolina were really pretty.  Nevertheless, \\"The Big Chill\\" certainly has myriad meanings: The world being a cold place and warmth is with friends, everybody is just hanging out, death of a loved one is a wake up call, the feeling I had when the movie was over or that weird thing with Meg and her pregnancy!!I am cool with that, because that is what life is in many ways.  This movie nailed that on the head.  However, the middle was just empty.  I began to question who had really committed suicide. As for the soundtrack, yeah there were some good tunes and most of them were played at very odd times.  For instance, everyone drives to the graveyard to bury their friend and jovial tunes of 1960s cascade in the background.  Huh?      I honestly believe that this movie was a sign of the times and a period piece.  I was six years old when this movie was released.  Perhaps if I were 30 something when this was came out I might have loved it.  Notwithstanding, technology in modern times has made keeping in touch much easier.   Ultimately the acting is good but had its determents and the location shots in Beaufort, South Carolina were really pretty.  Nevertheless, \\"The Big Chill\\" certainly has myriad meanings: The world being a cold place and warmth is with friends, everybody is just hanging out, death of a loved one is a wake up call, the feeling I had when the movie was over or that weird thing with Meg and her pregnancy!!

B003UESJH4|1.0|If you're into a whitewashed film that turns a blind eye towards the reality of the time & the lead characters' ties to Hitler, then you might be one of the many unsuspecting audience members who are lured into believing this tedious exercise in film making is an 'Oscar worthy' endeavor. As the Oscars rightly proved in 2011, they are all about handing out awards these days to puerile attempts at historical drama, with particular attention paid to films that attempt to dumb down British history.<br /><br />\\"The King's Speech\\", a C-grade production that reduces historical fact to mere background, is yet another feather in Anglo-American productions that attempt to discredit what real movie-making is all about. However, this is all done so beautifully that many seasoned reviewers have called this an 'epic' or 'masterpiece', which is undoubtedly not the case.<br /><br />The primary issue lies with the convenient assumption that the British monarchy at the time were clean-cut individuals who were all about self development & attention to the nations requirements (it of course, says nothing about Chamberlain & Churchill's involvement with the Nazi Party). That being bad enough, it attempts to project Colin Firth, already a wishy-washy actor if there ever was one, in a role that is shamefully overplayed and terribly scripted. This is most telling when the best reception Firth gets is when he is uttering one word expletives during a training session with his vocal coach, played by Geoffrey Rush (in a play by numbers that is mind-numbingly toe-curling, for all the wrong reasons). Rush can sleepwalk through roles like these, as he plays much of the film as a passive observer of the royal affairs and is reduced to farce by the films' almost comical climax.<br /><br />The casting of Helena Bonham Carter as Prince Alberts' wife is also most befuddling, as it appears she has been in more period pieces than any other contemporary actress around; and in all of them she looks and sounds the same. The only time Carter has been outside of her comfort zone was in that incredible Tim Burton production with Ewan McGregor, but here it is business as usual, as she proceeds to carry herself with a faux-monarch air from one pointless frame to the next. I also found her presence most distracting, as she is the most unnatural of actors, in general. Consider the scene where she visits the house of Rush for the first time alongwith her husband, and while her acting here calls for restraint, she comes across as pompous and immensely unlikeable. I suppose its some relief that Carter didn't pick up any accolades for her performance here, because honestly, we have all witnessed it a thousand times before.<br /><br />Firth on the other hand, has to contend himself with vacuous one-liners that seem curiously targeted towards `the masses', as if things on screen need to be repeated or stated when not even required. What could be conveyed through expression or a glance, is always verbally stated here instead, lending the film a very `History Film for Dummies' feel, which is especially disconcerting. The best performance, if one can call it that, comes from Guy Pierce, who is normally terrific in everything. Here he is woefully miscast as King Edward VIII, and he steals whatever scenes he is present in, even the ones where he appears with Wallis Simpson. Considering `Bertie' would go on to become the future King George VI (the father of the current Queen Elizabeth), one would think that his story would be presented in perhaps a more sophisticated manner with the true history of the time perhaps brought to the fore some more.<br /><br />Bewilderingly, the real life speeches of the real King George VIth (present on the DVD) aren't as dramatic or overwrought as the fake ones presented in the movie. Hollywood obviously took poetic license here, but it does make you wonder if this entire thing is a non-story if there ever was one. \\"The Kings Speech\\" is an example of a film that had no reason to be made, other than bask in an undeserved spotlight during awards season only because it gets tick-marks on certain vital components (its is well filmed, and the costumes are of the Age). Considering the Academy at one point in time honored such classics such as Amadeus, Sophie's Choice or Out of Africa, to find them groveling and throwing awards to Julia Roberts in \\"Erin Brokovich\\", a horrific Gwyneth Paltrow in \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" or a dazed Colin Firth in \\"The Kings Speech\\" really speaks volumes about how far they've fallen, and the degeneration of their relevance by pandering to tepid popular fare.<br /><br />If at all a fan of the classics or a connoisseur of the arts and history, you might find \\"The Kings Speech\\" laughably bad. And that's because it is. Don't believe the hype - that's for the masses that don't know better. Lets just say that if you found \\"Anne of the Thousand Days\\" from 1969 or \\"Mary Queen of Scots\\" from 1972 to be `populist drivel', you will obviously hate this. Compared to more recent films of British history that also take license with real history, such as \\"Elizabeth The Golden Age\\", this film fares much, much worse.

B004MDYMZ0|5.0|As Notting Hill is one of my most favorite movies I had to give it five stars.  The Blu-ray picture looks great.  The extra \\"Spotlight on Location\\" featurette (14.5 minutes) and music videos: \\"She\\" by Elvis Costello and \\"You've got a Way\\" by Shania Twain are a nice bonus. That said let me move on to a technicality.  This is evidently a UK bluray edition?  I am not a terribly observant guy.  No nitpicking here, but even I noticed that the final song during the credits: \\"No Matter What\\" was missing.  Instead we hear \\"From the Heart\\".  I double checked with my dvd copy and I was not mistaken.  I have no idea what else might have been changed.  I have no intention of running the two versions side by side.  I will leave that to others more interested.  I didn't notice anything else on the first run so I am satified, but.....  Oops, just noticed that the feature commentary from the dvd version is missing.
0156027321|5.0|\\"Life of Pi\\" by Yann Martel is the type of fiction I most like to read. It's colorful, sad, horrific, funny and hauntingly beautiful. It's a wonderful potpourri of spirituality, zoology, survival and adventure. It's a breath of fresh air, and a cool, clear glass of ice cold water on a hot summer day.<br /><br />  We all have our trials and tribulations, the storms of life we must endure. Sometimes these ordeals scathe and scar us, and sometimes they change the very essence of our being, or rather, they bring to the surface the courage and the strength and heart that was heretofore buried deep within us, hidden from even ourselves.<br /><br />  Pi is faced with the choice to sink or swim, and his decision is made no easier by his brutally unpredictable shipwreck mate, Richard Parker. He must keep his only companion alive while using his cunning and knowledge to keep this mercurial beast from devouring him, literally, all while staving off starvation, dehydration and exposure to the elements.<br /><br />  \\"Life of Pi\\" is ultimately a delightful story of hope and faith overcoming doubt and fear. Martel reveals the beauty of life by juxtaposing it with the unsightly, and the effect is a multicolored cloudburst of inventiveness and imagination. And it lands on my list of books to read more than once.<br /><br />David Allan Reeves<br />Author of \\"Running Away From Me\\"
B0029LHX1W|4.0|As a general rule I tend to shy away from books, movies and stories wherein the victims are children.  That being said, I did take on this fictional tale of a serial killer of children in the post-Stalinist Soviet Union, and it really was a fairly good story, particulary considering it's the author's debut novel.<br /><br />Nearly the entire first half of the book is an exhaustive development of what life in Stalin's Soviet Union must have been like: the paranoia that drove the communist bureaucracies, the fear and poverty that gripped the citizenry, the injustices meted out on citizens by Stalin's apparatus of \\"justice\\" wherein guilt was presumed, the pitting of acquaintance against acquaintance and family member against family member out of duty to the State.  Although the development of the setting was exhaustive it was certainly necessary as it allowed/caused/forced the protagonist to evolve from a hero of the Motherland to an Agent of the apparatus to...something quite different than he was when he started.  (To say what he evolved into would give up his final position and circumstance.)  Anyway, suffice it to say that Smith was quite effective in setting the mood of life in 1950s Russia, and was quite adept - on the whole - at character development.<br /><br />From the 1/2 way point to the end, the story of the killer and the investigator really takes off as the clues are finally identified and the pieces of the puzzle are put together. There has been some criticism of the ending by some reviewers, but personnaly I thought it was just fine and not a distraction from the overall strength of the novel.
0307595862|5.0|In his fifth novel starring Oslo police inspector Harry Hole and his fellow officers, author Jo Nesbo provides a complete surprise.  The Snowman, unlike his other novels, contains an element of horror that may soon make this his most popular novel among US audiences, a breakthrough novel which may finally put to rest the misperception that the Norwegian Nesbo is some kind of  \\"successor\\" to the Swedish Stieg Larsson.  It takes nothing away from Larsson and his terrific Millenium trilogy to say that Nesbo is a more versatile and more polished writer who has now written sixteen novels since 1997, including three children's novels, all of them huge successes in Scandinavia.  He has received eight major prizes for his work and four \\"shortlist\\" nominations.  If you enjoy tantalizing mysteries in the \\"Nordic Noir\\" genre and have not yet discovered Nesbo, I guarantee that when you do, you will not ever compare him to any other Scandinavian writer.<br /><br />The novel opens dramatically in 1980, as Sara, a young mother with her son in the car, makes a stop at the home of her lover for a last goodbye.  Their love-making is observed by a snowman who looms at the window, and Sara's young son, waiting in the car, believes that they are all going to die. Nothing more is heard about this episode, but in 1992, a terrible murder and dismemberment takes place on top of a mountain in Bergen, the first of the disappearances/murders by a serial killer who strikes on the first day of snow each year from 1992 - 2004.  Each crime is witnessed by a snowman who appears at the murder scene.  Police inspector Harry Hole, in charge of the investigation, is soon being taunted by the snowman whose sole purpose seems to be to suggest that innocent people are behind the crimes.<br /><br />In the midst of all the turmoil involving the disappearances and the effects on the distraught families, Harry, an alcoholic, is trying, sometimes unsuccessfully, to stay on the straight and narrow.  His long-time love, Rakel, has found peace with a new lover, and her relationship with Harry seems to be over.  Other characters from past novels also appear here.  Beate Lonn, an expert on facial recognition, is now caring for her baby son, born after the death of Halvorsen, who was her lover and Harry's partner. The obnoxious Magnus Skarre is still making Harry's life miserable.  And a new female recruit, Katrine Bratt, is introduced and impresses Harry with her diligence and intelligence.<br /><br />It is impossible to describe the complexity and cleverness of this plot without risking spoilers, and the novel is too much fun to read to risk that.  Suffice it to say, the novel is detailed and intelligent, and will keep even the most jaded mystery lover intrigued and wanting to see how it is all resolved.  Medical mysteries run parallel with the murders, old mysteries from the cold case files get dredged up and investigated, characters are not who they appear to be, and who the snowman is and exactly how he is able to pull off his crimes with the whole country watching keep the reader on tenterhooks. When the last little piece finally falls into place at the end, every detail in the novel suddenly makes sense--and provides a satisfying sense of finality to this challenging case.

0307887960|2.0|I had high hopes of losing some weight on this diet.  It's almost like a combination of Atkins but with little to no fat, and Sugar Busters, with little to no sugar.  Unfortunately the Dukan Diet has little to no carbs also.  Especially in the Attack Phase.<br /><br />I won't go through all the phases, because almost everyone else has in their reviews.<br /><br />My Attack Phase was supposed to be 5 days.  I followed it to a tee, even though it was hard to follow and I did have questions which I found more answers to on a Dukan forum than in the book.  For instance, yogurt.  I found conflicting information, and not enough information in the book.  Some places Dr. Dukan states fat-free yogurt, other places he says fat-free, sugar free.  So which is it?  That is an example of me having to go to a forum to get the right answer.  There are others, but frankly at the moment I don't have enough energy to search them out.<br /><br />This morning, on the third day of the Attack, I woke up to cramps so bad in my legs, and especially my toes, that I could barely walk.  I felt bad, too, but I went to work anyway.  I'm sitting here at my break time at work trying to write this review and I have absolutely no energy, my mind is foggy, I still have cramps in my feet and legs, and I feel completely drained.<br /><br />All this and I have lost a whopping 2/10ths of ONE POUND.  I'll be honest here and say that I have borderline low potassium levels and I'm on a prescription potassium pill, and you should check with your doctor before beginning this diet.  I should have checked first but there's a month wait to get into my doctor, and I was hoping to shed a few pounds before my visit with her.  I upped my potassium dosage this morning but it will take awhile to feel better.<br /><br />Just a warning that this diet isn't for everyone.  I'm going back to Sugar Busters where I can include whole-grain carbs.  It's taught me a lesson that Sugar Busters isn't all that restrictive as compared to Dukan.  And I did manage to lose 29 lbs. on Sugar Busters in just 8 weeks back in the summer of 2009 and I felt good while losing, not drained and without energy.  Give Sugar Busters a try if you can't live without carbs (good, whole grain, unprocessed carbs).  [[ASIN:0345469585 The New Sugar Busters!

0374158460|5.0|What is most interesting about this book is Franzen's ruminations on the meaning of freedom. His characters are never so fragile as they are the more \\"freedom\\" they have from the world around them. He adds many layers onto this idea, including the American idea of freedom expressed in our foreign policy and in our neighborhoods, homes and families.     This idea is finally, brilliantly complete in his discussion of birds (free of gravity and yet so fragile and endangered) and house cats (not native to America/ indifferent killing machines). It's fulfilled within Patty's family after the death of her father when the estate must be split, but each member of the family is accustomed to so much freedom/self-expression that they can only think of themselves.     I think Franzen is saying that too much freedom can lead to selfishness. We leave our spouse and then are faced with our freedom, which can feel like a prison of it's own.   I don't think it's an accident that Lalitha dies alone because she is forced to leave Walter to deal with anarchists.     In a passage showing how fractured and depressing our American society has become, he has a religious fundamentalist, government-hating (but living off the govt through road contracts)  neighbor try to figure out if Patty is a \\"socialist\\" liberal by asking her a question.     The question? \\"Do you like birds?\\"   In our modern America, even that simple question can be a trap.     Yet Franzen allows characters to be redeemed. Joey, especially, who is apolitical and ambitious, moves from a terrible, isolating selfishness into redemption through his love and acceptance of his girlfriend/wife.   A beautiful, moving work of literature. A classic.
B004KA9MQO|3.0|My title says it all. This cd is not one you can just put on and jam to. It's more of a background music cd. She sings well, but the song selections are lacking.But i still love her voice, attitude, and style.
B002ZG98C8|4.0|Definitely leave your brain at the door with this movie.  I love this film !!!!!      Sure, their is a plot but I really don't think you are meant to think too much about it.  It is a just a good ol' splatter movie with over the top violence, blood, gore, the odd gratuitous nudity and overall doesn't take itself seriously and neither should you when viewing it.    I think some people have over-analyzed this movie a little - just enjoy it for what it is.
0817439390|5.0|This is a wonderful book. If you've bought a DSLR and have forgotten all you knew back in your film days, buy this book.  If you're new to the world of DSLR's, buy this book.  If you're shooting film, buy this book.  It's an easy read,  broken down very simply and conveys a wealth of knowledge in plain old English.  One of the nice things that stands out in this book is that the author understands that some concepts take longer to wrap your head around than others - he even give examples of things he had trouble with - but he gives great examples that really help explain the concepts.  Did I say you should buy this book?
B004NDVJA0|5.0|I first heard of Agnes Obel on Echoes. They send me emails telling me who's going to be on. I looked her up on YouTube. I was pleasently surprised with her singing and the videos. I especially like \\"Down by the river\\". When I first heard it I kept playinging it over and over. \\"Philharmonics\\" is very good too. There are a couple of instrumentals as well. This appears to be Agnes's first CD, in March she visited the USA for the first time, (Austin Texas). Agnes Obel has a lovely voice, very relaxing, unsurprisingly she's very popular, I'm sure we will be hearing much more from her. \\"Down by the river\\" was played on \\"Grey's Anatomy\\". I love everything on this CD, this is now one of my favorites, I'm glad I purchased it. I'm hoping Agnes releases more CD's.

B0013N3DSE|2.0|This is easily one of my top ten favorite films. Maybe even in my top five, which is why this new blu-ray edition was so disappointing.<br /><br />The film's transfer is frustrating to watch. It vacillates wildly between grainy, speckled, soft, and finally the pristine look that one normally associates with blu-ray.<br /><br />Now, I know what some of you may be thinking, that I simply don't \\"understand\\" how film grain should look in the new format, and I'm talking through my hat on the subject. While grain may look different on a hi-def trasfer, there are points (notibly in the opening scene where the town crier reads the news of King Richard's capture), where the grain looks almost like static.<br /><br />And some sequences are overly soft, if not almost blurry. We aren't talking about a limited understanding of Digital Noise Reduction on my part, we're talking about a slapdash job of processing the master.<br /><br />Worst of all is that throughout the entire picture, there are white speckles that come and go in varying degrees, but almost always present, interspersed with pristine scenes, usually close-ups of the characters. It honestly reminded me at times of an old VHS master!<br /><br />In fact, I suspect this bad mastering is the reason the disc is relatively inexpensive. I swear, this couldn't the master Warner Bros meant to use. Perhaps it was the one used for training their technicians, and it slipped through into production by mistake.<br /><br />Sound and color are both good. Extras are fair for a low priced disc such as this. But for now, until this classic is revisited properly for blu-ray, your best bet is to stick with the excellent two disc DVD release from a few years ago.

B004J4WQ46|2.0|The Strokes are one of my favorite bands. One of the reasons I like them so much is that they've been great at filling albums with lots of great tracks. I like every single track on their first two albums--not a clunker in the bunch. I thought that half of FIOE was very good, and the other half was okay. Still, up until Angles, the Strokes were batting somewhere in the .800s with me--a ridiculously consistent output.    Angles is the direct opposite of that consistency. I find most of the tracks to be entirely skippable.     \\"Under Cover of Darkness\\" is an excellent track--one of my five favorite Strokes tunes. Some are saying it's overproduced, too busy, or just a re-hash of their old stuff. There is a lot going on in the song, but that's always been a big part of the Strokes' sound--multiple guitar lines bouncing off each other. And I'm glad it sounds like their other stuff--their other stuff is excellent. And it's not like they just retooled \\"Last Nite\\" or \\"Someday.\\" \\"Under Cover of Darkness\\" is definitely its own song, and it's a dandy.    \\"Gratisfaction\\" is the other really solid track on the album. It's not their best track, but it's a good song. I see a lot of reviews claiming a heavy Thin Lizzy influence on this song, but I don't see much distinct similarity. Thin Lizzy (a good band in its own right) wasn't the first or only band to play crunchy distorted guitar chords. I feel like the crunch of \\"Gratisfaction\\" has a brighter sound than Thin Lizzy anyway.    I don't really like \\"Life is Simple in the Moonlight,\\" but it's a half-decent song with some interesting parts. I could see how some might be into it. Other than that, I feel like the album is pretty bad. Only 2 of the 10 tracks made the cut into my iTunes library. I'd advise downloading just those two songs and leaving the album on the store shelf. Keep the extra cash, save up, and go to a Strokes show--they're still one of the best live bands around. It's a hard album to grade. One great song, one goodsong, and a bunch of filler. \\"Under Cover of Darkness\\" is good enough that I'd like to give it 2.5 stars, but without that option, I've gotta round down.    EDIT:  I'm fine with a band changing their sound. The Strokes don't have to make another \\"Is This It\\" for me to like the album. They could put out a hip hop album and, as long as it was good hip hop, I'd like it. The problem here isn't deviation from their previous style (which I don't find to be as one-dimensional as some make it out to be). The problem is that most of these songs just aren't very good, regardless of style.
0553386794|5.0|This book completely changed my conception of what a fantasy novel could be.  Martin like many fantasy writers has a richly created world, but what he understands better than most is that characters make the book. His characters are incredibly developed and in almost all cases unique, not stereotypical.  His books are longer, but he does not waste a single page. His vantage point switches between characters capturing the pivotal moments in the lives and history of his world.<br /><br />Martin's characters in this book are honest, real and intriguing.  You fall in love with his characters so much that it is painful at times when tragedy occurs (and beleive me, it does). His prose is excellent.  This series is one of my absolute favorites.<br /><br />The only reservations I would offer are that Martin is not even close to done with this series and in crafting his masterpiece he spends multiple years between new books.  It is also evident that Martin has created a disturbingly real world where horrible things happen to good people (sometimes the best of people).  I beleive however that deep down Martin is a romantic, some of the \\"good guys\\" will probably win in the end but only after surviving an emotional holocaust.<br /><br />Honestly one of the best books I've ever read.  Absolutely brilliant.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|The thing about Hawaii Five-0, I think you either love it or hate it.    Now it isn't always perfect, and let's be honest, what show is - there'll always be episodes with weaker plots than others. And if you don't like explosions, gunfights, sunshine, bikinis and banter, this is probably not your show.    But even when you take away the pretty setting and the action Hawaii Five-0 still has a core that rings true. Because this show is all about family. The lenghts you'll go for your family, losing an old and acquiring a new and all versions of the term that excists. Ohana, as the Hawai'ians would say. It is the characters who carry the show.    Steve, who loses his father and tries to patch up his relationship with his sister.  Danny, who moves halfway across the world to be with his daughter.  And last but CERTAINLY *never* least, Chin and Kono, the pair of counsins, who will do and sacrifice everything for their family.  These four come together and find themselves thrown into their own kind of family, and this is where the show has its heart.    One thing I love about this show is that even though Steve is the main character with Danny at his side most of the time it never becomes the Steve McGarret Show or the Steve and Danno show. Chin and Kono are never reduced to 'lackeys' or 'helpers' of any kind. They have their own scenes, their own plot and they get to shine just as much as Steve and Danny. One could easily argue that some of the strongest scenes of the season were acted out by the amazing Grace Park and fantastic Daniel Dae Kim.    Another great thing is the team dynamic. It's not just Steve and Danny's partnership that sends sparks flying across the screen - it IS a huge reason for why I watch this show, but it is far from the only reason why I enjoy it as much as I do. The team together is amazing. They tease and they jibe and they got each other's back no matter what. Kono and Danny has an awesome chemistry and Chin doesn't hesitate to call Steve and Danny 'ladies' when they need to be called down to earth. It's rare to have four leads who just work no matter which constallation you put them in.    Enough about the main characters, because the regulars and guest stars definitely deserve a mention, too. Danny's daughter is made of adorable, his ex-wife is a brilliant character, McGarret's sister is made of awesome and Kamekona is just made of win. The show also really lets local actors shine. Again, no show is perfect and not each and every guest star is equally good, but they definitely hit more than they miss, in my opinion.    Now, if this kind of action packed, entertainment minded, doesn't-pretend-to-be-something-it's-not show is not your thing, fair enough. If you don't like actor X's portrayal of character X, okay then, we all have different tastes. What I'm saying is: This show may sometimes seem ridiculous (and seriously, which promos saying things like \\"It's not just hot - it's explosive\\" it's unavoidable) and some may call it a disgrace to the original (I wouldn't know, I wasn't born), but it does have a lot to offer, even besides the pretty scenery and action, and definitely deserves a chance.    Personally, I'm enjoying it. Every single week. In different amounts depending on the episode, perhaps, but I NEVER leave thinking 'okay, this was a waste of time'! To the very much contrary. I've become invested in the characters. I smile, I laugh, I worry. I obsess. I melt every time Steve makes those eyes (you know the ones), I shout at the screen when an episode ends in a cliffhanger. I rewatch my favorite clips, promos and YouTube videos multiple times. Hey, I even have an iTunes playlist with Hawaii Five-0 themed songs.    In conclusion: Brilliant acting, engaging characters and definitely worth giving a chance. If you don't like it, don't see what I see, hey, that's okay.
0307474712|1.0|this is the worst book i have ever read. if you want to feel like life is terrible and you will never find happiness and there is no hope then read this book.
0316056863|5.0|I'm a huge Tina Fey fan, so it would've had to been a really bad book for me not to like it. Thankfully, it was a really GOOD book and I enjoyed it very much. She's got great stories in there from SNL and 30 Rock. I've even rented the audio book from my library and listened to her read it after reading the book myself. It's great to hear her stories directly from her (though you don't get to see the awesome pictures as it goes along). Can't recommend this book enough!
B002RI9S2Y|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. First, when I didn't get to the adventure of the story, I thought 'Oh, I think this book will take a long time to read.' but no!! When I got into the adventure, I couldn't stop reading and my thought was 'Oops, I guess I was wrong because I cant put this book down!'     The Percy Jackson series is a story of a teenage boy who is a son of a Greek God (how cool is that?) and he has to save the world with his friends- Groover and Annabeth. In the story he is betrayed by one of his friends.      The book is funny (thanks for Percy's talking skills :)) and fast moving. Some parts of the story is based in Greek mythology, which was great because it is interesting to read stories which greek mythology and world nowadays are mixed.     Buy this book, you won't regret it!! :)
B00004WNHC|5.0|Bob's first recordings and what some fine one's they are. Thick vinyl, awesome cover, and fast shipping also help make this a no-brainer of a purchase. So &#34;Catch A Fire&#34; and sit back & relax with one of Bob's best!
B00004TLKI|5.0|It was a great movie.  I watch it every Halloween.  It's like Alice in Wonderland for adults.  Johnny Depp being Alice and thrown into the Rabbit Hole or chaos.  and the White Rabbit is the Nine Gates book.  The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows is the white rabbit that led Johnny Depp/Alice into a world of chaos, danger, and confusion.  Botist or whatever his name is, would probably be the Chesire cat. and that Brunette who keeps trying to kill Johnny would be compared to the Queen of Hearts.   Sorry, but there is much comparison to the Ninth Gate and Alice In Wonderland.
0061998494|5.0|I'm just over 100 pages in, and I am really enjoying this book. It's brutally honest and laugh-out-loud funny at the same time. Craig Ferguson is a comic jewel and like Keith Olbermann says, this country is lucky to have him.
1840225564|5.0|Great price.  Respectable copy.  A bit heavy to manage while reading.  Considering the number of novels packed into one volume, though, that's not terribly surprising.  Happy overall.
B002N5N4M6|3.0|Although there are moments of jocular entertainment to instigate laughter I am dejected with the straying from real geeky humor. The appeal to sexual references is overwhelming for an academic. Also, the contradictory thought that Sheldon, the 'genius,' has is appalling; and probably confusing to some who really think these characters represent intellectuals. I enjoy revelatory humor of the geeky and intelligent, just not the degradation of their thought processes. Sheldon for example, as a true physicist, does not believe in luck and makes plenty of subtle references to providence (not chance), then denies a creator? I have yet to meet someone who would adhere to this sort of paradigm. Most, if not all physicists I know of discover God through logic, mathematics, and the universe (Einstein for example). Yet, Sheldon's psyche is a mess. Secondly, the directors, writers, or whoever, have made Koothrappali a real jerk. Most geeks I know enjoy and appreciate friendship because it is so rare; as opposed to insulting their friends; especially those from other countries. Teasing is normal, but there is a line that is usually never crossed. Intellectual geeks are very sensitive. The paradigm of the characters has begun to shift to an immature level of social interaction. Granted, there are many people like this in the world, but I do not desire to see one of the best comedies turn into the typical sitcom. It's science and genius is what makes it stand out and above the rest.
0446563048|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read.  Tony Hsieh gets it and provides great tips on how to deliver happiness to customers.  I believe all companies should be required to read this and then they might understand how to make their customers happy and loyal all the time.    I am happy now for reading this book and look forward to making happiness happen a lot more.
0307595862|5.0|Not my usual type of read but after finishing the Stig Larsen books wanted more of this genre. Found Harry Hole a very good character and enjoyed the book enormously.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Provides some very good background on the financial disasters of 2008.  Kind of troubling hearing the facts about the AIG bailout and the Goldman involvement and financial betting.  Uncle Sam got stuck covering unregulated and \\"private\\" financial bets.     Nice depiction of the drawbacks of unrestrained and unregulated greed, and influence on government.  Although the maudlin pictures of a single poor Chinese in a big empty factory was kind of a joke/artistic license.         Kind of paints a poor picture of Pres. Obama who inherited this disaster at its peak.  Which I'm not sure I agree with, to unravel a 16 to 24 year problem in the first 2 years after the crap hit the fan is a little unfair.   If I recall correctly,  John McCain was sizzling mad also,  that if he won he would inherit the disaster.    I did like the interviews where brute confrontation and sticking to facts seemed to unnerve most of the fairly cool interviewee's. Especially the academics who are \\"above the fray\\" and are not used to being grilled.
B002436WJE|4.0|The movie Taken was very good. The action sequences were very good and the acting was decent. The movie is about a retired guy named Bryan Mills(Liam Neeson) who's trying to retire. His daughter goes to France with her best friend and she gets kidnapped. I will not say anything more about the storyline of the movie. But  I would like to say this though. The movie is pretty disturbing once you find out what happened to his daughter and why. I won't spoil it in how it was disturbing but I would say that people ages 15+ could see this movie. But if younger viewers would want to see the movie, than I reccomend them watching it on a clearplay filtering system which would take out the sexual stuff and more disturbing violence.(for more info, go on clearplay.com), THank you for reading my review.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|The only regret I have about this documentary is that I am not wealthy enough to buy a copy for every person I know, every library in the country and simply to hand out to every passerby on street corners! It is an exceptionally important topic, well covered and well organized in this presentation. The subject matter is VERY unsettling and while it's been covered in many places over recent years, in only a very few places has it been covered honestly and with as much clarity as can be summoned over such a murky set of schemes and their cunning connivers. This documentary should be viewed by every American and most certainly before the next election. Americans have been very quiet and passive while being robbed. Perhaps this documentary will arouse them to demand real change. Even if it does not have that affect, it will inform and educate viewers who might see that Bernie Madoff is in prison, but there are many others, just like him, who still are out there living in unbelievable wealth, power and influence, operating, manipulating and relieving Americans - and other nations' citizens as well - of their savings, homes, jobs, pensions, and security. Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme finally landed him in prison for life, while these other Ponzi scheme operators on Wall Street, in banks,and in government continue to hold positions of great power, as they did in the Reagan, Clinton and W. Bush administrations and continuing in the Obama White House, while continuing to accumulate unimaginable levels of wealth by transferring money from America's middle class and poor over to their criminal coffers, a collusion of government officials and those Ponzi scheme operators! You see fantasy movies like \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" while real-life pirates from Somalia who aren't quite so dashing and \\"charming\\" operate on the high seas and REAL pirates operate with impunity in all levels of finance and government, robbing the rest of us blind with the imprimatur of OUR own government! Meanwhile, experts warn of the inevitable recurrence because there has been no reform, no change and those who brought us the last Big Heist are still in power - they must think they don't yet have ALL of the money! They lust after Social Security funds and any other meagre savings from \\"baby boomers\\" and under the current administration and Congress, they will get their greasy hands on it soon. I recommend that everybody buy two copies of this DVD, one for your personal viewing and another to give to a library, school, organization or friend. In other words, spread the word, while simultaneously supporting the maker of this documentary who was very gutsy in facing the most brazen, craven arrogance I have ever witnessed from the likes of Glenn Hubbard, et al. Charles Ferguson, the maker of this documentary, deserves our kudos and the best way to \\"kudo\\" is to buy a copy - or two or three!Meanwhile, experts warn of the inevitable recurrence because there has been no reform, no change and those who brought us the last Big Heist are still in power - they must think they don't yet have ALL of the money!

B001GZ6QC4|4.0|The Dark Knight is a movie that has broken so many records to date. Third biggest gross domestically in North America, Reached the Billion dollar mark, and has won two academy awards. Yes Heath Ledger sorta did deserve the academy award for best supporting actor. But the movie was all about the action sequences(including a very well done car chase) and Heath Ledgers character. Overall I say that you should see this movie for yourself if you don't believe how good it is. But for the record, Batman Begins is alot better.
B001SS3JS8|5.0|First of all, I absolutely LOVE Jodi Picoult and this was probably the 4th or 5th book of hers that i've read. I truly enjoyed this book with all its ups and downs, this might not be the best book for someone who likes cheery romance stories but its great for someone who enjoys a little drama in a book. Worth reading.
B0034G4P80|4.0|Thor is one of those movies that has everything in it. It has  great action scenes and some funny moments. The acting was very good, especially Christ Hemsworth(Thor) and Natalie Portman(Jane).Although you could see this in regular 2D, it would make it even better if you saw it in 3D. I saw it in 3D and I thought that they used 3D technology really well( especially when they were in Asgard). So my suggestion to you is to actually listen to the critics(78 percent have given Thor a good review on RottenTomatoes.com)and go to movies or buy the DVD when it comes out. I know that I will definetly add this to my movie collection in the near future.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Simply put, this movie is a MUST WATCH! And, a must watch TWICE, because you understand the story so much better the second time around. This movie is one of the best I've seen on Blu-ray, and that's saying something. It is also an amazing movie in surround sound, the explosions, bullets flying by, and dialogue are all wonderful in surround sound. You will feel as if this is a reality, and you are living inside of it. Considering whether to buy this movie or not? Buy it. You will not regret it, and if you do, I'm sure you can find someone who will take it off your hands! lol.
B00005JNJV|5.0|Batman Begins is a great movie that shows how he became Batman. I would say that if you don't see this movie, than you have problems and should buy Batman Begins right know. Because it has great acting, great action sequences, A great villian, And I think all the credit goes to Director Christopher Nolan who has made a Batman movie that I actually enjoy watching over and over again. If you ever want to watch Batman,skip the Batman movie of the 80's and 90's and the animated tv series.Instead watch this great movie.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|We all know the characters in this film. They are presented in a coherent way so we can understand how badly this country is being run for the benefit of the very rich, and the rest of us are just left behind. I'm happy I purchased it and can show it to friends. It was highly recommended by a number of people, and is not difficult to understand, a reminder of a sad part of our history and the ruthless way we are manipulated for the benefit of the few.
B000A2IPP0|5.0|Im sure by now ET is a classic.  The quality of picture was great !  Sound was great!  I ordered this movie because my grandchildren had never seen it.  They loved it and as usual, I cried at the end.
B003HARV4S|4.0|I am tired of hearing folks whining about this being a rip off of The Prestige, A film I was not that enthused over.<br />I Enjoyed this film immensely  Edward Norton is subdued but powerful, Paul Giamatti as always excellent.<br /> Jessica Biel was somewhat wooden but there is little she could do with what she had, and Rufus Sewell was extremely hateable and nasty in his role as Crown Prince Leopold.  The Photography was splendid, slightly dark as fits the mood of the film, and a fine soundtrack to boot.  I heartily recommend it.

0385341679|5.0|From the last book, it's clear KMM ... well she's the master of the 'cliffhanger'. I, like most fans of the Fever series, waited anxiously for the final installment and finally, blessedly, it was here. Pre-ordered months before it was supposed to hit the shelf. Long over-due but worth the wait. This series is a must have. I have read hundreds of books, in all genres, but my first love and true passion is paranormal romance. I dug the Highlander Series and I like Mac and Co even more.  I am sad to see them go, with this conclusion, but like all good things, even this, must come to an end. The series has everything that a good story should entail: action, adventure, murder, mystery, suspense, betrayal, the unknown, and yes, romance as well.  While writing in the first-person is usually not my thing, I must admit that I really liked the voice of Mac; I liked that as the reader I got to see her through her eyes, and take the same journey as she, and watch as she matured through each sequential book.  There are bigger, longer, and more thorough reviews on here, but I am adding mine to say that yes, all these people are not wrong, and this conclusion is worthy of anyone's time.
B0047Y17P2|3.0|This book was not as good as the other lincoln lawyer books.  I liked the original and the other two that followed but this one I had to force myself to get through and it seemed choppy and not as interesting.
B0039SFKSW|5.0|Background -- I do not like prog rock.  I do not like YES, Rush, or any other band (minus a few key songs) that goes on and on and on with an \\"instrumental break\\" - A 'break' anyway implies a short recess of time off singing.  Most prog rock songs are 3-4 minutes of singing, and the remaining 10 minutes are of guitar solos, drum solos, keyboard solos, and a mix of the above.  That is not to say that the musicianship is not impressive, as it usually is, but it is just not my thing.  And the aforementioned is not a blanket statement either, so don't get me wrong, it's not that I distaste every song that pushes past five or so minutes ... just most.  I tell you this because ASIA essentially came from progressive rock people: John from King Crimson, Steve from YES, Carl from ELP, and Geoff, while he played in YES, is more famous for The Buggles.  In any case, to my surprise, I really like ASIA despite the fact they came out as a progressive rock band, of sorts ... or, they aren't progressive enough depending on how AR (anal retentive) one gets with the definition.  And perhaps, on some level they would be right.  But if memory serves me, Wetton had once said in an interview that the main difference between ASIA and say KC was that the four minute song contribution he went in with, was basically the four minutes they came out with.  I applaud John and the gang, this forward thinking.  I also feel it pertinent to mention that I'm 32, female, and grew up listening to The Beatles and their mostly upbeat and catchy two and half minutes of pop-rock fun .. I also like high doses of Tesla and Bon Jovi, but that doesn't really apply, here. Moving on ... OMEGA is a great CD.  I thought that everything Phoenix was lacking (mainly more rockier songs) they brought to the table with Omega.  I particularly liked \\"There Was A Time\\", \\"Holy War\\", and \\"I'm Still the Same\\".  \\"Holy War\\" has a killer drum solo by Carl and even though it clocks in way past my more preferable four minutes it is worth every second.  \\"There Was a Time\\" just sticks in your head and has all the components of a good rock ballad.  \\"I'm Still the Same\\" reminds me of what I liked about The Beatles: a short fun little number with cool lyrics.  I give this CD five stars based on the fact that Omega is a good, solid listen from cover to cover, a rarity now-a-days.    My two cents ... Even though their first album sold the most copies, that doesn't necessarily equate that it is the best album.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|It came very fast and I'm happy with it. I'm very pleased with the packaging. This is an Anime that I have been looking for a long time and will always keep.
0743482832|4.0|The Tempest is thought to be Shakespeare's  final play. As such there is much in it that  calls to mind earlier works. To me the Tempest is reminiscent of A MidSummers Night Dream. The themes of separation, betrayal and forgiveness and restoration are prominent. It is relatively short but contains summation of themes that are found throughout Shakespeare's works.<br />I have always enjoyed the Folger Library edition of the plays. The use of explanatory notes on the facing pages is incredibly helpful and allows the narrative to be followed with out the need to page back and forth when a phrase requires a quick refresher. If you are looking to find a well edited and accessible paperback version of the Tempest I highly recommend this one.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I LOVED this book!  I bought the Audible version, and the actor who voiced it was perfect.  The character of the dog is absolute genius and was voiced perfectly.  A perfect fantasy.  I can't wait until next month when the sequels are released.
B000002GB4|2.0|I'm going to have to disagree with the majority of the reviewers on this album.  I liked Styx at the time these albums came out, but was (and am) a Rush fan, and anybody else's albums were secondary to purchasing the latest effort of the Canadian trio.  This was pretty unusual in North Augusta SC - most heavy music fans were backing Led Zep and never the twain should meet.  Some of you will know what I'm talking about.  Well, I had a copy of Equinox on 12\\" platter and liked it quite a bit - no recollection of how it came to me, although I'm pretty sure I didn't buy it.  I still enjoy it side-to-side, which has always been the mark of a solid effort in my eyes.  It's punchy with some interesting songs, even if a little under-produced.  I then bought Grand Illusion on strength of Come Sail Away and Fooling Yourself, both of which got pretty heavy AOR airplay, and thought that was 9 on a scale of 10.  I rounded out my Styx library in the day with Pieces of Eight (still think DeYoung's organ opening Blue Collar Man is a defining riff for that instrument), but wasn't very impressed with anything they did after that.    So, to those who think Crystal Ball is a better album than Equinox, I have to disagree.  I bought Crystal Ball recently with the rationale that Styx had hit a pretty good stride on the prior album (Equinox), and adding Tommy Shaw would mean the next album would kill.  Wrong.  Frankly, this album is lyrically very shallow.  With the exception of the title cut, which is excellent and deserving of the \\"classic\\" status it has garnered, there is not another good song on the album.  Don't get me wrong - there some solid playing (although there's some embarrassing playing too - whoever is on the slide in Shooz was wise not to repeat THAT mistake), but between the platitudes, clichés, DaDonDo's, LaLaLa's and WoWoWo's, this album is pretty trying.      It seems likely they had hit a writing slump (I don't think it was the last time either - listen to the lyrical contributions of DeYoung's bandmates at the end of I'm OK on Pieces - way to support the team guys) and were under time-pressure to get this out.  I don't think it's any accident that Shaw's song got the title track.    I think a two star rating is pretty generous for this album.
B00005JLZN|4.0|A fantastic film that I recommend to anyone who is a fan of Spacey and wants some really intense Suspense and Drama
0425220931|5.0|Even as an average music-person, I greatly enjoyed the references and saw the links between music/art/life in a way that I had never thought of before.  There were gems of wisdom that I will carry with me for the rest of my life.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1 is even more exciting than the last six films. It is more nuanced and the  dynamic that arises between the now maturing trio of friends adds another level of excitement to the story. I am 76 years old and half of my continuing survival and health is dependent on waiting for the final installment of this marvelous series. Truly for fantasy lovers of all ages!
0751543403|5.0|good read!  honest, funny, and a bit painful at times  as a musician, a lot hit home  even if you're not a muso, a very entertaining read
B004SEVPWQ|4.0|I would have rated this a 5*, but I'm saving that for an app I haven't met yet. The physics are quite realistic, as are the sounds, something I've found to be a large part of the asthetic in billiard games. The graphics are great as are all the available table designs. I was surprised to learn all the myriad of billard games played around the world, all of which are playable in Pool Break Pro. A great game, and well made.
B003C5FMEE|1.0|Strange, this CD sounded great on JazzFM.com and the sample tracks sounded great on Amazon but once I purchased this CD from Amazon and had it shipped to me. The actual CD was total crap. I dont know if this was a bad copy or a bad mix but the music is flat and washed out, sounds like its missing a track or two. I would NEVER purchase this again and I hesitate to purchase any more CDs from Amazon or the producer of this CD. Just total garbage.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|I use this app a few times a week. I find it's a perfect companion for long commutes (I don't drive)  where I get sick of music and am too tired to read. If you like talk radio, or sports radio, this is a great app.

B002G1K82Q|5.0|ACROSS THE UNIVERSE is a stunning musical paen to love, loyalty and commitment.  Set against the turbulent 60s  anti-war sentiment, the movie is magical and amazing in its effortless segues into the classic Beatles music.<br />Not since WEST SIDE STORY has a musical been so insightful into the cultures of the time.  Under imaginative and superb direction, the cast is superlative.  Evan Rachel Wood is a luminous Lucy' Jim Sturgess is wonderful as Jude and the support from Martin Luther, Dana Fuchs and Joe Anderson is strong.  Cameos by Joe Cocker and Bono sweeten the mix.  The music---well, what other contemporary musicians have amassed such a wide variety in style and endurance?<br />ACROSS THE UNIVERSE deserved better commercial success but if you like a great musical film, this one should grace your repertoire.
B002ZG98C8|4.0|Bypass any serious Grindhouse expectations, and this will be a good movie. \\"Grindhouse\\" wasn't even mentioned in any of the credits. Seeing the preview in Planet Terror, I expected to get alot of the same. To think, there were no Grindhouse-type previews either. Machete was produced at 20th Century Fox, so there were obvious limitations on the extremism. However, there were some heavy-hitter stars with good acting on board (Does anybody else see the irony of Don Johnson and Cheech Marin here?).    Also, I think there was a change in plot somewhere between the preview and the release that left me confused - was Machete out for revenge, survival, or justice? Were we to believe during the preview that Machete was an ex-cop?    Good movie. Not as much Grindhouse elements as expected. I truly hope that there is a director's cut...      ...with all the trimmings!
B0034G4ORM|5.0|I enjoyed this film immensely. This is no summer popcorn flick or mindless special effects movie, this is gripping drama, intense action and extreme emotion. Aaron Eckhart was correct in his assessment of this as a \\"war film\\". You kind of forget that they're fighting an unknown alien army in a sense because the drama and story is so intense. The acting in this was excellent and you can really connect with the characters. If you want some silly skin and CGI, rent Skyline for a lighter version. Battle: LA is a fantastic, gripping war film that could be described as Saving Private Ryan meets Independence Day.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|It's charming, as per usual, with touches of Brit irony keeping things bouncing along.    Knowing the book helps very much.  I expect non-readers will be perplexed.    So many scenes have dark lighting, perhaps a modern artistic fad, while dramatic perhaps, I do not find such cinematography interesting.      As a Potter story it is ok.  Fun to watch with marvelous CG work.  A popcorn movie.
B004G600A4|3.0|Tangled is the 50th film produced by Walt Disney's animation studio (for clarity, that number does not include joint productions, or Disney releases from other animation studios like Pixar).  This list of 50 includes some of the greatest movies of all time - Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, The Lion King, and 101 Dalmations.  Unfortunately, Disney studios has ceded the animation mantle to Pixar, and their last 10 films cannot hold a candle to the likes of Toy Story and The Incredibles.  So I was expecting, for the 50th film, a better effort, especially with John Lassiter as producer.  While Tangled does not quite live up to its more distant predecessors, it at least is an enjoyable 90 minutes, and it does contain some very nice animation and some big laughs.  It is also likely to be remembered as an \\"also ran\\" when compared to Disney's other release of 2010, Toy Story 3, which won an Oscar and set the box office record for most successful animated film of all time.    Tangled is an adaptation of the Rapunzel story, elaborating and making Rapunzel's hair the fountain of youth (it's not as absurd as it sounds!).  I suppose that explains how she can drag it through meadows, rivers, and forests and never get it dirty.....  Unfortunately for Rapunzel, the hair needs to be attached to her head for it to work its magic, therefore she is held prisoner in the tower to satisfy the selfish needs of her adoptive mother, Gotha.  A thief named Ryder, fleeing from his latest caper, uses Rapunzel's tower as a hiding place, and their meeting sets in motion a chain of events involving Rapunzel and Ryder travelling to the royal city, pursued by the local constabulary, Ryder's disgruntled henchmen, and Rapunzel's \\"mother\\".    Ryder's quipping asides generate many laughs, as do the antics of Maximus, a horse from the city guard that goes beyond the call of duty in trying to bring Ryder to justice.  There is also the joy of a remarkable action set-piece involving a breaking dam that is(dare I say it?) astonishing in it's animation (akin to the scale of Mulan's avalanche or the Lion King's stampede).  There is also the usual cast of Disney minor characters to lend colour and fun to the proceedings.  Certainly children will enjoy it, male or female, at least, if my 2 sons (5 and 3) and their female cousin (5) are any indication.  And it's ultimately harmless, certainly there are no traumatizing moments like Mufasa's death, and the violence is FAR less than that seen in The Incredibles or even Sleeping Beauty.    But it doesn't quite all add up to a classic film.  I think the problem lies in the backstory - Rapunzel is kidnapped by Gotha from her parents, but there is no emotion in their plight because no time is spent in developing their characters or any relationship with their daughter.  By contrast, King Stephan has a prolonged scene in the middle of Sleeping Beauty, Mufasa teaches Simba and plays with him in the Lion King, and Belle's sacrifice for her father in Beauty and the Beast is not taken until after a number of establishing scenes showing Maurice by himself and with Belle.  Thus the reunion in Tangled has no particular emotion in it.  The second problem is with the music - there are a number of songs by Alan Menken (with lyricist Glenn Slater), but they sound like they belong in a Saturday afternoon teenage sitcom on the Disney Channel (e.g. \\"When Will My Life Begin\\" and \\"I See the Light\\"). True, \\"I've Got a Dream\\" is a joyous setpiece to rival \\"I Just Can't Wait to be King\\" or \\"Under the Sea\\", but one song does not a musical make.  Finally, I would be remiss if I neglected to point out that this is not a good value-for-money DVD.  Considering I paid the same price for Toy Story 3 and Tangled, the former has a number of neat extras, including a featurette on Pixar's modelling process, various short tours of Pixar's studio, and footage of a Buzz action figure on the International Space Station.  All Tangled has is footage on an alternatebeginning which, while interesting, is paltry indeed compared to most Disney releases.  (of course, the intended audience will not care one whit that the DVD has no extras....)    Overall, I'd place Tangled in with the likes of lesser (but still enjoyable) films such as Atlantis, Hunchback of Notre Dame, or Pocahontas (but better than The Rescuers or Tarzan).  And it's certainly better than most other animation out there that passes for children's entertainment, such as Will Farrell's Curious George, the Rugrats Movie, the Clone Wars film, and even Pixar's A Bug's Life.
B003FSTN5C|1.0|I am a big fan of the CSI's. When I heard a LA Series was in the works I said, \\"Another one?- well let's see.\\" The story line is mediocre and the acting is non-existing. I mean, Chris O'Donnell and Ll Cool J.,., well it's just sad.... Two thumbs way down!!!
B004GXKBFQ|3.0|The picture and sound upgrade on this Blu Ray are noticable. But, there is not a single extra or special feature on this one.  All the deleted scenes and \\"Making of\\" features on the SD DVD are gone. So, if you buy this PETER PAN, you'd better hang onto your SD DVD.

B003L77GH4|5.0|very awesome show, leaves you having to watch the next episode. I got season 1 and season 2 was so much more dynamic, just have to get it. Love the character Damon, with his unpredictability and stefan comes out of his shell a bit this season too. Awesome! And I hate twilight, this is so not twilight, its more in reality than twilight, considering television these days I should say LOL.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I have no idea why people keep mentioning Twilight when they talk about this show! This show is based on a series of books waaay before twilight and it's completely different! The actors are really amazing and Nina Dobrev as Elena/Katherine just shines! Ian Somerhalder as Damon is outstanding and even if he plays the 'evil' brother, you learn to love him even if he screws up most of the time. Another shining star this season is Candice Accola who turned shallow and materialistic Caroline into a very emotional more grownup supernatural creature.  Thumbs up to the writers! the show keep getting better! ROOTING FOR SEASON 3 ALREADY! :D

It has been twelve months and I'm very happy to be able to be in control. I had serious health problems with my eyes; my chilesterol went down from 320 total to 115 total. I feel much better and younger. If I can do it, enybody can do it.

0307472841|1.0|I began my reading saga of Mankill with The Return of The Dancing Master. I was so enthralled by the tight plotting and excellent story development I vowed to read anything else he wrote. I read all of the Kurt Wallender series with relish and genuine satisfaction. The Man from Bejing started off with a violent crime scene reminisent of Mankell's best writing, but went downhill from there. That piece of violence had the potential for a complete crime saga in itself, but quickly turned into a fimsy pretext to get into the complexities of modern Day China and Africa. As others have pointed out \\"too many coincidences.\\" There was no strong thread that led the reader from modern day China back to the village in Sweden and the murder of 19 innocent people. A red thread was literally a red herring, and its presence was never explained in the context of the narrative. The pretext of bringing   Chinese laborers to Africa was intuitively improbable, and in the mind of this reader - a mishmash of goals and intents. I was still reading the last page of the book in the hopes that perhaps Mankell would (as he has always done in the past) explain his narratvie. Nope, didn't happen. Just a bunch of \\"maybes\\" in place of a satisfying reconcilliation of motives.   As disappointed as I was in this one entry by Mankell, whatever his next effort is - I will read it. In spite of this blunder he is still one of the finest mystery writers active today.    \\"Spencer
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Finally! Foo Fighters are back!  I've been waiting for an album like this one for 10 years and started to despair.  But this one is big. Huge.  It's not that the previous ones were bad, but more uneven in quality. One by One had some good stuff, even In your Honor.  But this one is great from start to end.  It's not that it's revolutionary, but it's a Rock album like nobody delivers for years and you didn't know how much you missed it till you hear it again.  I knew they had it in them and today they definitely proved me that they deserve to be my favorite band for almost 13 years.    Keep doing what you're doing and hope to see you live (again) soon!

0439023513|5.0|I greatly enjoyed The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, but unlike some of the reviewers, I believe Mockingjay was my favorite of the three.  Although I went through the first two books rather quickly, it was only for the third that I found myself reading until 2am when I knew my alarm would be going off at 6.  The clever author kept putting a twist or cliffhanger at the end of each chapter which kept driving me on to the next.    Unlike some other reviewers, I enjoyed the turn in story away from the games themselves and towards the rebellion.  I found that this new focus made the characters--especially Katniss---become even more human than in the previous books.  This is not the stereotypical story of a teen with some impossible power who saves the day and lives happily ever after once she attains her victory...and that's what made me love it.
B004GHNHVW|5.0|I originally ordered two cd deluxe sets, one for me and one for my parents. Then my brother stopped by and liked the music so much I bought just the cd without the additional DVD and had Amazon mail it to him at college in Michigan.

B0045HCJGC|5.0|This is a movie that will make you laugh your *bleep!* off. It's an action movie with a lot of humor, and a lot of satire. When a dangerous, extremely violent criminal (Simon Phoenix, played by Wesley Snipes) escapes from a cryo-prison in the near future, the very peaceful, friendly, non-violent society that Earth has become can't handle him... so they unfreeze another criminal to catch him - the cop (John Spartan, played by Sylvester Stallone) who put him in prison in the first place.<br /><br />As you can expect with those two stars, there is plenty of violence, plenty of fight scenes... but there's also a lot of humor throughout the movie. Ironic, sarcastic humor, but still funny as *bleep!*.<br /><br />Plenty of other known faces in this as well - Sandra Bullock ([[ASIN:B0006GANOQ Speed]]) in particular has fun with her part, but you'll also find Glenn Shadix ([[ASIN:B000P0J074 Beetlejuice]]), Nigel Hawthorne ([[ASIN:0783231202 Amistad]]), Benjamin Bratt ([[ASIN:B000BGR1AK Law & Order]]), Bob Gunton ([[ASIN:B000P0J0EW The Shawshank Redemption]]) and Bill Cobb ([[ASIN:B000NOKJC2 Night at the Museum]]). And rounding out the crowd is Denis Leary ([[ASIN:B0008JIJ1A Rescue Me]]), who plays a role that seems tailor-made for him - a sarcastic, anti-Establishment revolutionary.<br /><br />This is a movie that's great to watch again and again, for all sorts of reasons - even if it's to catch all the in-jokes that you didn't quite get the last time through. There isn't a lot on this DVD as far as extras, but there are other editions that do have those. All in all this movie is just plain fun, no matter what the critics might say about it... but the critics hated [[ASIN:B000FQJAIW Star Wars]] and [[ASIN:B002VPE1AW Avatar]] too.

B002TOJHCM|5.0|I owned this songbook long ago and loaned it and never got it back.  I decided to buy the Kindle version to test what a songbook would be like via Kindle.<br /><br />The print on the Kindle device is sort of small, a little larger if you landscape the print.  For an oldie like me I would not be able to view the print and play at the same time.  I could review the page, practice, review the next page .... etc.<br /><br />The real good news is that if you have Kindle on your computer (desk top with a really large monitor prefered) this songbook really shines.  On my 32\\" monitor I can see the print from halfway across the room or further away if I increase the font size.<br /><br />So I have the portible version via the Kindle device which is usable and at home I can optimize by using the songbook via my desktop PC.<br /><br />Although there are websites where you can view chords and tab for free I wouldn't hesitate buying a kindle songbook in place of a paper songbook in the future.

B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I eagerly plugged my ATR-3350 into camera, mixer, and computer, and was plagued with extremely low volume, as some reviewers have noted. Then I discovered that I had put the button battery in UPSIDE DOWN. The unit came without any instructions, and there is only a molded icon at the battery installation point, and I didn't look at it right. The unit works at very low volume with the battery backwards, and just fine with it in the proper orientation. It is a good piece of gear for the price. Minus 1 star for no manual or warranty card in the package.

B004EPZ070|4.0|I read the book a couple of years ago and loved it.  That being said I didn't have high hopes for the movie, because usually the movie is not as good as the book.  I don't necessarily think the movie disappointed.  I knew the story so I knew what to expect. Ginnifer Goodwin was excellent, as were John Krasinski and Colin Egglesfield.  But Kate Hudson...at one point one of my friends looked at me and said \\"she's doing a great job cause I can't stand her!\\" knowing that we should hate Darcy based on the book.  But she took it to another level.  I don't normally like her, but this was even difficult to watch at times.  It all just seemed so forced that it really took me out of the movie.  Overall, I still really liked the movie and being the rom-com fan that I am, I'm sure I'll see it again someday when it come out on DVD.  So, at the end of the day, to me it is a good chick-flick, especially if you have a long-time best friend to see it with.
B004NSULHM|5.0|The consensus seems to be that Radiohead \\"fans\\" want Radiohead to give them more of the same old thing without sounding repetitive or selling out.  If you are one of those \\"fans\\" then I guess you might be disappointed.  If, on the other hand, you accurately remember not being sure what to think of \\"Ok Computer\\" or \\"Kid A\\" and then falling in love with each of them after a week or so, you will likely appreciate and very much enjoy \\"The King of Limbs.\\"  It is a typical Radiohead album in that it is not the same old Radiohead.      And maybe 10 years from now, all these naysayers will understand.  Or maybe not.  But this is a great album.  I cannot comapre it to any Radiohead album from the past other than to say that it will someday be considered a masterpiece like some of the others before it.

B003UESJH4|5.0|Bertie, soon to be King George VI of England, should have joined a Toastmasters International club and he probably would have overcome his fear of public speaking like I did.  Instead, Bertie visits a controversial speech therapist, Lionel Logue, who helped many shell shocked soldiers to speak again.  Through the use of cursing, singing and dancing, Lionel helps Bertie to overcome his stuttering and deliver one of the most important speeches in history.  Consequently, the two of them develop a lifelong friendship.<br /><br />  Tom Hooper's \\"The King's Speech\\" is a highly emotional historical drama which greatly surpassed my expectations.  World War II looms like a dark cloud over all of England.  The elderly king has died, the oldest prince relinquishes the throne because of a sex scandal, and the youngest prince, Bertie (Colin Firth), is forced to become something he has always feared and dreaded.  With the patient, long-suffering guidance of Lionel (Geoffrey Rush) and the loving support of his wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter), Bertie is able to overcome his fears and insecurities.<br /><br />  Friendship and love are important themes throughout \\"The King's Speech.\\"  The royal family is a shockingly dysfunctional one.  Bertie aptly described it when he said, \\"We're not a family.  We're a firm.\\"  As a child, Bertie was emotionally abused by an overbearing, perfectionist father and a cruel, mocking brother.  Lionel's life hasn't been entirely fulfilling either; he yearns to become a Shakespearean actor but has become too old for the lead roles.  Through their friendship, the two men learn to overcome their obstacles; they are given new purposes in life.<br /><br />  The costumes, sets, music and acting for \\"The King's Speech\\" are positively superb.  They helped to transport me back in time to a pre-World War II Britain when Adolph Hitler is threatening England with his troops.  I became extremely teary eyed while listening to the king's dramatic speech announcing England's entry into the dreaded war.  I felt as though I too was a citizen living at that time.  Fear and dread coursed through my body.  During the speech, I also wondered what would happen if the President of the United States gave a similar speech in the present.  Again, I shivered with fear at the thought and prayed that would never happen in my lifetime.  The pain, suffering and destruction brought on by war truly unnerves me.<br /><br />  \\"The King's Speech\\" gave me a reason to be afraid; I feared the threat of impending war.  However, it also gave me a reason to rejoice; I rejoiced  over friendships found and loves renewed.  And the beautiful qualities of love and friendship can help us overcome our deepest fears, even our fears of war and death.  It is no wonder that \\"The King's Speech\\" won four Academy Awards.  I only hope that Tom Hooper can direct more films of this grand magnitude.  I only wish that the language could've been toned down so that younger audiences could watch it.  \\"The King's Speech\\" is a film that should be viewed by all young people for its historical significance and its emphasis on friendship and love.<br /><br />Joseph B.

0307477479|4.0|The novel is a collection of short stories which are related to Bennie Salazar, an ageing former punk rocker and record executive, and his assistant Sasha.  Each story (chapter) is told by a different person, in first, second or third person and takes place at different times and different parts of the world.  And time is the key to this novel: we readers are observing the lives of people who wonder what has happened, where have the years gone, and how they could have passed so quickly? The lives of Bennie and Sasha touch on a number of different levels.  While Bennie and Sasha have known each other for a long time, they do not really know much about each other.  We come to know them through the various stories told in the novel.<br /><br />We meet many of the characters both as teenagers and then as adults and see that although life has moved in often unexpected directions, the desire to belong is still constant.  Seeing Bennie Salazar's life from a number of different perspectives provides a series of links between the past and the present for both Bennie and those characters.<br /><br />We meet Bennie Salazar at a low point in his adult life.  Bennie is divorced and is  struggling to connect with his nine-year-old son -- and then revisit him in 1979, at the height of his youth, enjoying San Francisco's punk scene, discovering his passion for rock and roll.<br /><br />We first meet Sasha in her mid-thirties, on her therapist's couch in New York City, confronting her long-standing compulsion to steal. Later we see her as the child of a violent marriage, then as a runaway living in Naples, and then as a college student trying to avert the suicidal impulses of her best friend.<br /><br />Somehow it seems fitting that there is a journal presented as a PowerPoint presentation towards the end of the novel: modes of communication and presentation continue to evolve, even as Bennie bemoans the state of digital technology.<br /><br />I admired the structure and presentation of this novel, and enjoyed the way in which Ms Egan presented the lives of Bennie and Sasha.  Some music and art may prove to be immortal: the people who create it are not.  Time's definitely a goon.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smithwhich Ms Egan presented the lives of Bennie and Sasha.

0618918248|3.0|Book report: The God Delusion, by Richard Dawkins    Boy, do I miss Carl Sagan. In the good old days, if I wanted to read scathing indictments of religion, closely reasoned arguments against the existence of God, and a boost to atheism generally, all I had to do was reach out and read Sagan's latest book. I was guaranteed to find fascinating insights, clever analysis, and impressive reasoning, all in his elegant and memorable style. Plus, the bonus of Sagan himself as a courtly and genial host. Now, all we have is Richard Dawkins and, believe me, it just ain't the same.    In reading The God Delusion, I find myself in a peculiar position. I am unquestionably Dawkins's target audience. I'm reasonably intelligent, educated, and have a background in science and math. I tend to be analytical, critical, and skeptical about every other topic under the sun. I even believe in evolution. However, I do happen to know that God exists, for reasons that would not impress any other person, but that are more than sufficient for me. So, reading a book about how God doesn't exist and how people should stop pretending that God exists is something like reading a proof that there is no sun. It's not going to have the intended effect on me, so I can just sit back and judge the presentation on its other merits.     Dawkins's stated goal of The God Delusion is to liberate people from the pernicious influence of religion, making it, in a sense, a self-help book. Why must people automatically choose the religion of their parents or their society? I totally agree that each person should explore and make the best choice they can, even if that leads them away from the footsteps of their parents. If this book helps people to think for themselves, great. The question is: does it?    He tends to presume what he hasn't yet proven, starting on page one with phrases like \\"the vice of religion\\". He also asserts many extremely abstract points, such as the complexity of God, without any remotely convincing reasons. Dawkins is also something of a bully. He sounds like the kind of demagogues you hear on Fox \\"News\\", who know that if they yell loudly enough and use enough inflammatory language, they can browbeat the opposition into conceding their point, if indeed they have a point. Dawkins is very similar. Anyone who doesn't share his beliefs is an evil ignoramus (I kid: he doesn't use the word \\"ignoramus\\"; but he does use \\"inane\\", \\"insane\\", and \\"faith-head\\"). By contrast, anyone whose beliefs overlap his is wonderful, savvy, intelligent, and enlightened. Funny coincidence.    Dawkins may not worship god, but he does worship Thomas Jefferson (\\"farsighted\\" and \\"honorable\\"). He uses many, many Jefferson quotes throughout the book, although not the ones about \\"endowed by their Creator\\" and \\"I am a Christian\\", for obvious reasons. I find Dawkins's admiration of Jefferson hysterically funny, for a couple of reasons. First, Dawkins doesn't have one millionth of Jefferson's political savvy. Jefferson, after all, not only wrote the Declaration of Independence, but he also induced 56 otherwise sensible men to sign the document, thereby risking their lives, families, and fortunes. By contrast, Dawkins, with his sneering and condescending style, doesn't have a prayer of converting many to his cause (see what I did there?). Second, Jefferson, um, owned human beings and apparently raped at least one of them. Perhaps not quite the model rational atheist to hold up as an example.     The book is poorly organized. He has chapter headings, and even sub-headings, but these are only departure gates for his meandering expositions. He bounces from argument to argument like a ping pong ball in a tornado. Also, Dawkins is extremely repetitive, repetitiously repeating the same repetition over and over again. Even people who agree with evolution, like me, will tire of how frequently he brings up Darwin. Many times, I found myself thinking, \\"Yes, Richard, we get it. Next slide, please!\\"    He has a lot of fun making the details of various religions sound ridiculous, but this, of course, is as easy as shooting fish in a barrel. I learned long ago, and probably most readers have also learned, that it is very easy to make *anything* sound ridiculous, including birth, death, love, hate, honor, suffering, and the Boston Red Sox. I can do a pretty good five minute standup routine on the periodic table, Newton's laws of motion, and the quark model of baryons, but that doesn't make them not true. Still, Dawkins seems to have a good time calling people names.     He also enjoys setting up straw men and knocking them down again. For example, if he can't find a real quotation to mock, he has no problem making up an outrageous statement and then mocking that. That method, at least, saves him the trouble of footnoting the quotation.     At several points, he misstates certain aspects of certain faiths. A reader can only conclude that either 1) Dawkins didn't understand what he read, or 2) Dawkins didn't actually read it, or 3) Dawkins misstated it deliberately just to make a point. I can't decide which is the more charitable explanation.    He sometimes employs double standards. For example, he starts the book with a lyrical description of a young boy lying in the grass enthralled by the wonders of nature. Later, he spends 6 pages arguing that any person who has a personal experience of God is having a hallucination. How does Dawkins know that the enthralled boy wasn't also having a hallucination? It certainly couldn't be because the boy's experience parallels Dawkins's own, while the personal experience of God doesn't, right? Oh, it's because the boy's experience is scientific and repeatable! Of course! *Any* person who lies in the grass becomes enthralled by the wonders of nature! And no personal experience of God has ever been repeated! Got it.    His reasoning, and even his science, is iffy. For instance, Dawkins seems to be under the impression that he has refuted Aquinas's first three proofs of the existence of God, but he hasn't. He has, however, demonstrated his own unfamiliarity with the nature of infinite regress. I'm aware of several plausible (although possibly not actual) refutations to Aquinas, but Dawkins doesn't use any of them, possibly because they involve physics. He's pretty shaky with physics, and makes a couple of jaw-dropping missteps when he strays away from biology. He presumes to know exactly when and *how* the universe was created, and also that any God must have been created after the universe was, which, logically, would make it impossible for God to have created the universe. He really should let physicists know that he's solved this problem, so that they can stop pointlessly wasting their time trying to figure it out. In addition, he makes sweeping statements that have obvious counterexamples, which undercuts his case. For instance, at one point he says, \\"intelligent beings [meaning God] must be the product of an evolutionary process.\\" The obvious counterexample is artificial intelligence, which doesn't speak to the God aspect of the argument, but does show that there is at least one counterexample, possibly more.    Let me save you a few hours of reading by summarizing his message, which has two basic points: first, there is no scientific evidence that God exists (oh, you knew that?), and second, some religious people are evil (oh, you knew that, too?). Not that he should provide equal time to the other side of the argument, but you won't find anything in his book about all the hospitals, schools, orphanages, old age homes, soup kitchens, women's shelters, counseling centers, and social welfare agencies that religious organizations have established in the past couple of millennia, including schools that Dawkins attended and the university that currently employs him.     In the midst of all this, Dawkins does make a few good points. For instance, he points out that when people make statements about their own religious practices that others find ridiculous, everyone just tiptoes around such statements without comment. Why is that? I know that some religious practices sound loony to me, and mine must certainly sound loony to others. But no one ever says, \\"Why on earth do you do that?\\" Why is that? But he doesn't explore this at all. Also, his observation of appalling behavior in the Bible is absolutely true: I don't know why some people regard those folks as role models. And Dawkins's concern about children exposed to traumatic religious experiences is important: parents need to take better care. For instance, my kids never heard \\"Now I lay me down to sleep\\" from me. He is sometimes entertaining when he's not being nasty. For instance, I really enjoyed his exposition of the anthropic principle.    Dawkins is sometimes astonishingly insensitive to the human condition. At one point, he says something to the effect of: what \\"why\\" questions could theology possibly answer that science could not? I'm sure that he means questions like \\"Why do electrons orbit a nucleus?\\" or \\"Why do camels have humps?\\" But if he would step out of the laboratory in the ivory tower for a few minutes, and spend some time in hospital waiting rooms, or soup kitchens, or unemployment lines, or cemeteries, he would hear plenty of questions like \\"Why did she have to die?\\" or \\"Why did he have to get sick?\\" or \\"Why can't I feed my family?\\" or \\"Why am I alone in the world?\\" Good luck finding satisfying answers to those with science.     So, if religion is wrong, why is it so widespread? Dawkins shrewdly refuses to say, preferring to muse that it's sorta kinda something like a by-product of the trusting gullibility of the child, or possibly a genetic predisposition, but maybe not exactly. By wisely declining to spell out his ideas, Dawkins avoids the kind of withering criticism that he directs at religions, which, after all, foolishly spell out their beliefs in great detail for all the world tosee. This is intellectual cowardice of a high order.    The last chapter is a mess, as if he threw a general science book in a blender and hit Frappe. He seems to be trying to set up science as a viable substitute for religion, but I think that's a tactical mistake on his part. Most people don't like science, and if he's forcing them into an either-or decision, he may find that not many choose atheism. I think that he would do better to offer people a science-lite version of atheism, but he may be too much an elitist to go that far.    Boy, do I miss Carl Sagan.    Recommendation: Read *anything* by Sagan. If you find that you need venomous language, fuzzy thinking, and a narrative that jumps around like a kangaroo on a pogo stick, then by all means read The God Delusion. Dawkins makes a good blunt rock to sharpen your mind against.    PS  For the past five years or so, I've been reading a daily thought-for-the-day kind of thing. During the couple of weeks that I was reading The God Delusion, I happened to read an entry that started, \\"Recently, I listened to an audiobook by a militant advocate for atheism. As the author himself read his own work with spiteful sarcasm and contempt, it made me wonder why he was so angry.\\" Dawkins would call my reading this passage at the same time that I was reading his book pure coincidence, even though I've probably read a couple of thousand of these daily things previously, and don't ever recall one about this topic. I, being an ignoramus, have a different explanation.
B002IVLH60|3.0|This is Pearl Jam rocking again. A nice short, punchy album. Might be their shortest. I believe Backspacer was needed after the last few albums, all of which are...ok. Actually I like Riot Act quite a bit, but it was dark.<br /><br />We get a big rocker here in \\"The Fixer\\". Possibly the first memorable single in years. Then the mellow hit \\"Just Breathe\\" which my local station has played daily for months. \\"Got Some\\" is good, as is \\"Amongst The Wave\\". \\"The End\\" is a nice...finish.<br /><br />Overall a solid Pearl Jam disc. Not near my favorite of theirs, but it's still quite good. Now about that cover art...stupid or stupendous?

B004VD3PE0|4.0|In If I Stay, we meet Mia, a very talented cellist, who is in love with a boy who wants to be a rock star. They find their lives being pulled in two different directions. Mia hopes to go to Juilliard and Adam, her boyfriend, hopes to take his band to the highest points in the industry. Until everything changes for both of them. Mia's family is in a car accident and then she is left in a coma. While her body lies limp in a hospital bed, she finds herself taking a journey to figure out if she should leave everything on earth behind to be with her family, who are already gone, or stay and be with those who are there praying and hoping she will return. This story isn't just about love and loss, its about impossible choices and heartbreak. No matter what Mia's choice, she feels that she loses a piece of herself.     We follow Mia througout the book on a journey through her memories, making you better understand how badly she will break if she wakes up and has lost her family. We also see her relationship with Adam and how much they truly care about each other and how their lives are clearly drifting in different directions.This story is painful just to read but beautifully written and really hits its mark in making you sit at the edge of your seat to see which avenue she will choose.

B004LFO0JW|5.0|I love this album! I find the beats to be smooth and mellow. The lyrical content is good too. While Wiz Khalifa is a developing wordsmith, in some ways it is his lyrical simplicity that makes him great. I feel like he can give more, lyrically, but for some reason held back. I also find him to be a good story teller; and his rhymes are cohesive in such a way that they make sense. Sans the references to irresponsible behavior (drinking, somking), the overall vibe of the album is one of carefree fun; very \\"live-your-life-esque\\". Wiz is proud of his success and leaves you no choice but to step your swag up as his confidence is contagious!

(Makes me laugh, a rotary phone which most people don't even have a home phone much less can you even find a rotary? :)  But my daughter loves it all the same!  One con, the cord on the \\"phone\\" part is a little short so she can not have it on the floor and put it next to her ear.  The red cord to pull is long enough though.    Reminiscing her but the \\"original\\" has a curled cord on the ear piece and the eyes blinked on the front.  Still a great toy!

B001UV4XHY|2.0|The first half of the book was pretty slow, so I wasn't surprised to see this movie was as well. Unfortunately, as a movie, this entry in the Harry Potter series really doesn't stand up on it's own. It's basically just filling the gap between the previous film and the upcoming final conflict. I suppose given the amount of story that is covered in the novel, this is a necessary evil.    What I really want to review is the DVD picture quality. Oh my...it is bad. This is bar none the worst DVD quality I've seen since the original days of DVD. Compression artifacts are everywhere. Most noticeable is the area around Harry's glasses. There's nothing like mucking up the main character's face. As other reviewers have stated, the DVD isn't even at full capacity. Why press a DVD with unused space? I really hope this wasn't done on purpose to promote BluRay.

B000JLTR8G|2.0|In 1974 when this film was made, Japan was still strange and exotic and mysterious to most Westerners. So \\"The Yakuza,\\" with its implied promise of an \\"expos&eacute;\\" of Japan's criminal underworld, certainly must have seemed quite daring. Well, perhaps it was in 1974, but in 2011, it is absolutely deadly. It moves as fast as a snail with a stick at its behind--which isn't any faster than a snail without a stick at its behind. Its main appeal is watching Robert Mitchum as he tries to keep his eyes open and remember his lines at the same time. Bob was only about 57 when this film was made, but years of hard living make him appear at least 20 years older, and the film is so harshly lit that it looks like a cheap TV show... which, needless to say, doesn't help make Bob look any better.<br /><br />With a convoluted plot and character relationships that are borderline incomprehensible, it is a challenge to stick with it, and the \\"payoff,\\" while momentarily shocking, isn't worth the wait. What should be the film's highlights -- rare footage of Tokyo and Kyoto, keeps getting pushed to the sidelines so we can follow the \\"story\\" of a man named Kilmer (Mitchum) who goes to Japan to find the kidnapped daughter of a crony (Brian Keith, at his worst) and free her -- with the help of a former yakuza (Ken Takakura, who is probably the best actor in the film) who is obligated to Kilmer for saving his sister (a charming Keiko Kishi) after the war. Or at least we think it's his sister.<br /><br />Yes, there are unique moments, particularly in a bathhouse which features a huge aquarium right in the center of the bath, but again, what should entertain, delight, mystify and shock us sight-wise and culture-wise is overshadowed by a script that is dull, plodding and unintentionally hilarious.<br /><br />I had been told that this was a \\"must-see\\" for anyone interested in Japan, so I bought it. Well, you can buy it, too. Whether or not you want to after reading this review is entirely up to you... and, perhaps the yakuza.uza.

B003097B64|5.0|I am enjoying this purchase immensely. These CD's may or may not be remastered or remixed, but that suits me just fine. I find that the sound of the majority of recordings that have been \\"doctored\\" is rather harsh, and in some cases down-right un-listenable. The sound of each of these recordings is exactly as I remember them from my youth. They are certainly better sounding (and cheaper) than MP3's; plus, you don't have to make a back-up. And...as a wonderful bonus...they are packaged in mini replica album sleeves that have a very small footprint on your shelf.
0757302661|5.0|I just gave birth to my first child and i have to admit that i was TERRIFIED of giving birth until i read this book. I read this book during my 2nd trimester after crying everyday at the thought of what labor would be like. My husband heard about this book and insisted that i give it a shot. I was reluctant to read it as i was sure that nothing would eliminate the fears i had. To my surprise this book totally changed my outlook on the birthing process in just the first couple of chapters. It explained the birthing process and most importantly explained what my body would be doing while in labor. Understanding what i had to allow my body to do allowed me to feel more relaxed about the whole process. I gave birth to a 7lb, 6oz baby girl with no epidural or pain medication. My hard labor was only 2 1/2 hours long and i walked in to the hospital dilated to 4 with zero pain. While the book did not make my labor pain free, it gave me the tools to allow my labor to move quicker, comfortably and most importantly without fear. In my opinion it's a MUST READ for all expectant mothers!
0525422943|5.0|3 years have passed since Mia decided to leave. Now Adam a famous \\"Rock Star\\" lives the life most people would kill to have but to him is not what it used to be. Adam doesn't know why Mia never came back. She didn't call to explain why she decided to breakup with him. Somehow they find themselves together in New York and a night of questions, answers, regrets, goodbyes and letting go begins.     Where She Went was an amazing read. Sometimes I think Gayle Forman writes her books with a magical pen. Her characters are so real it hurts when they suffer. My favorite character was Adam, that's why I was so mad at Mia throughout most of the book but then I got why she left (she had her reasons). I loved everything in the book but one of my favorite scenes was when they were in the garden full of fireflies. How the author wrote it was so beautiful that it got stuck to my brain. Overall Where She Went is incredible.
0060512806|4.0|The real question for us is does Cryptonomicron reveal anything about the impact of the Internet? Fiction writers have an honored place as commentators upon periods of rapid change caused by technical developments---Jules Verne and H.G. Judging solely from Cryptonomicron, the answer, regrettably, is no. While the plot is larded with technical detail, and electronic communication is both critical to the plot and pleasingly commonplace, continually reaffirming our geekish inclinations, I can't say that Stephenson gave me any particularly new or interesting slant on such things... On the positive side, if you are trapped on what passes for airborne transportation in our degenerate age, then Cryptonomicron will probably keep you entertained and anesthetized at an intellectual level for many thousands of frequent traveler miles...

0312944926|2.0|Unfortunately, I find myself as a reviewer untechnothrilled and far from riveted. There is an common phenomenon in American publishing, where a writer who polishes his craft by writing commercially unsuccessful pieces finally hits it big, as did Brown with The Da Vinci Code, and his publishers gleefully exploit their rights to his early books and plaster the market with them. That appears to be the case with this book. In addition to being just too dated to tell us much about the Internet, the plot is so muddled and the characters so one-dimensional that I find it difficult even to summarize the work... Throughout, I learned little except that the NSA has a lot of computers and apparently doesn't do a very good job of assessing the honesty or even sanity of its employees, both major and minor...

B0033QEQGW|5.0|Now that the Talich Quartet's survey of the Mozart Quartets is no longer available, this bargain box from DG is probably the best way to acquire the complete cycle at a modest cost.  The Amadeus Quartet recorded extensively over the four decades of their existence (1947-1987).  They gave us multiple versions of the best-known Mozart quartets, and many critics would argue that their earlier, monaural recordings of these works were fresher and more deeply considered than their later, stereo efforts (which is what we have in this DG Collectors Edition).  As a longstanding fan of the Amadeus Quartet, I have heard all of their Mozart recordings, and am of the opinion that their later recordings are by no means inferior. The versions of nos. 14-23 included in this Collectors Edition are altogether superb: invigorating, yet gracious readings that manage to convey both the playfulness and the pathos of the music without undue frivolousness or schmaltz.  The Amadeus' collective tone is robust, with a pronounced vibrato to which some listeners (particularly the historically-minded) might object.  I find their sweet-singing tone enchanting, though some might find it cloying.  The early quartets (among which there are a surprising number of near-masterpieces) are given no more or less than the weight they deserve; their rococo charms are undeniable in these light-hearted, but never condescending renditions.<br /><br />There is only one point on which I would caution prospective purchasers:  The Amadeus are not generous with repeats.  If it is important to you to hear the expositions of sonata-form movements twice, then you should probably pass up this set, fine though it is in other respects.<br /><br />The recordings have been effectively remastered; the sound is exceptionally vivid, with instruments closely observed.  The upper register is smooth, not too strident at higher dynamic levels (as some DG recordings of chamber music during this period could be).  In general the ten mature quartets, though recorded earlier (1960's), sound marginally more natural to my ears than the early quartets, which (if memory serves me correctly) are of 1970's vintage.  No grumbles, then, about the sonics--this is one of DG's better efforts from the LP era.<br /><br />So if you're in the market for a complete Mozart cycle, do consider this set, which is attractively presented (though notes are rather skimpy) and economically priced.  I prefer the Amadeus to the Hagens in this repertoire (the latter's Mozart recordings are also available in a bargain box from DG); I find the latter's interpretations superficial, though not everyone will agree with me on that point.  The Amadeus were one of the great ensembles of their era, and I'm delighted that their Mozart is still available.tets, though recorded earlier (1960's), sound marginally more natural to my ears than the early quartets, which (if memory serves me correctly) are of 1970's vintage.

0761536434|5.0|The primary virtue of The Ultimate History of Video Games is that the author managed to interview almost everyone of significance (and he tells us who he failed to interview) in the development of the industry, from programmers and artists to CEOs and venture capitalists. Another virtue of the book is that it pays real attention to development outside the United States, and particularly to the development of gaming in Japan and its subsequent impact in the U.S. It was particularly interesting to learn that Japan, long thought to be hostile to the more spontaneous and informal ways of the computer industry, was the place where many American video game entrepreneurs and their companies in fact began... If you want to understand the historical development of that industry, and the many fascinating personalities who have contributed to its growth, you might well secure a copy of The Ultimate History...

B000G75994|5.0|After doing some research and reading tons of reviews I have finally purchased this set of Mozart Piano Sonatas.  This is also my first recording of Maria-João Pires.  The first song I played on the CD player is No.10 in C major K330.  I have heard other versions before (Horowitz, Barenboim etc) and I found Pires has rich and warm tone which makes Mozart so approachable and adorable. Lots of contrasts in colour and in dynamics.  She plays with spirit and awesome clarity, a wonderful Mozart interpreter. The sound/recording quality is also superb.  I am glad I got this set.  Highly recommended.
1401310672|4.0|hilarious book! Comes pretty close to the website, without the live updates. Not quite sure what I am going to do with it when I finish...it isn't the type of book you keep around and re-read. Maybe one to pass around your circle of friends?
0374290024|3.0|I'm surely part of the core demographic for this book: I have a serious weakness for big-theory history books, I love stuff like Jared Diamond and David Landis, I even have an (admittedly unread) complete copy of A Study of History somewhere in the attic.  But I've read 160 pages of this thing, and I am seriously wondering whether to go on. I am also wondering what provoked all those blurbs listed above.   We are bashfully informed by the author, in his bio, that this is his first  'trade' book, which makes me suspect that he probably lectures in a tweed jacket, and yearns for the All Souls common room as it was 50 years ago (if he wants to get any further with that yearning, he might want to ease up on the detailed - and unapologetic - knowledge of the The Clan of the Cave Bear), and also that this may be his last trade book.    So far it is blog-posting style chatty (trade-book?) prose, and a string of straw men that are systematically knocked down.  There has been an interminable discussion of the various waves of hominid colonization of Eurasia which is relevant to nothing I can see about the question posed in the title, meandering digressions into stuff like Parisian student politics in the 1960s and now what looks to be an equally meandering discussion of metrics for social development.  160 pages, and there is still not much sign of an actual, you-know, point, or of an editor.    If I can gather the enthusiasm to read any further, then I shall delete this review.  Otherwise, David Abulafia and Roberto Calasso are next in the queue, and they look much more inviting.    Three stars because I haven't finished it, and fewer would thus be unfair.

B003CRM6QO|5.0|Esta película de Flash Gordon para mi es la mejor película de Flash Gordon, esto incluye la serie de los 30 y la serie de hace poco el 2007 ( la cual solo vi unos 5 minutos y no entendí nada y no me gustó). La música de Queen la hace aun mas espectacular y la hace mucho mejor. El formato Blue-ray definitivamente vale la pena y le da una nitidez que usualmente el  DVD no puede tener. Asi que recomiendo BR en vez de DVD. Para que todo fuese perfecto, el BR debería de incluir la banda sonora en la misma caja, pero la música tiene que comprarlo por separado. Es necesario recordar que no es un film a lo Hollywood, sino mas bien un film europeo, asi que tiene un estilo un poco diferente. Definitivamanete una gran adquisición para mi colección de películas para difrutarla muchas veces.
1600108512|5.0|The Last Unicorn (the animated film adaption) has been apart of my life for as long as I can remember. I still watch the film to this day and I read the original book annually, at least. The little girl in me leaped for joy when I saw this graphic novel adaption of my favorite childhood story.     The story line is spot on. The art is absolutely breathtaking. It's obvious a lot of time, effort, and talent went into pulling this wonderful graphic novel together. I would highly recommend this comic to any lover of The Last Unicorn.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|Hook up the HR monitor and take the watch out of sleep mode and within a few seconds the HR monitor is detected and tracks.  It takes about 10 seconds for the watch to get satellite data for GPS and then you're ready to run.      The watch goes into sleep mode by itself if movement stops or the HR monitor is taken off (not entirely sure which does it, but a slowdown/stoppage of movement seems to me to be the triggering event).  As such, the battery life is good for 2 or 3 1hr runs and additionally several days in sleep mode.  All in all, I'd say that is fine given that I am using the GPS and HR when running.  The only issue is that the charger is proprietary - it clamps arount the face of the watch through two contact points.  It would have been nice if a micro-USB charger would work, but I'll accept that shortcoming considering how excellent the watch is!  I imagine a micro-USB port would make it susceptible to sweat/rain, etc so the proprietary charging systems seems to eliminate that possibility nicely.    The run info uploads to a tracking system on the Garmin website (software on the computer enables this).  This shows a range of data including a map of the route (to within a few feet), continuous HR, elevation, and pace throughout the exercise period.  Near instant transfer between the watch and my iMac (running Snow Leopard), wirelessly, after I take the watch out of sleep mode.  The software install process could have been more straightforward, as I found myself repeating steps based on prompts on the screen.  Internet connection seems essential to the install process and the uploading of data (which is accessible on a website after data transfer is complete).    I find this to be a terrific value for the features, even considering how ubiquitous GPS systems are these days.  The watch and HR monitor are no bigger than my last training watch, bought about 3 years ago, which cost more and was only an HR monitor.

0385737955|5.0|Review written by 14 year old girl:    The Maze Runner by James Dashner was a wonderful book that I liked reading. It had a tense plot, great characters, and a depressing ending. I always hate it when I finish reading a book but this book's ending was really disheartening.      Thomas can't remember anything before he woke up in a strange metal box. After stepping out of the box he finds himself in the Glade, surrounded by lots of other boys. Though time and patience he learns that all these boys were put there by the Creators who refer to themselves as WICKED and outside the enormous moving walls of the Glade is a Maze that seems unsolvable. In the Maze are the Grievers, machines that are covered with glowing goop, have six mechanical legs, and sharp needle that protrude out of their bodies in all directions and absorb their prey. There seems to be no way out of this strange world. Then, for the first time, a girl shows up in the box, and the Gladers know that something is wrong. Next, their only protection against the Grievers, the massive moving wall that close each night, has stopped moving. Time is all but gone and the Gladers must either fight to find a way to get out of the Maze or die in the Glade.      James Dashner is a great writer and I loved this wonderful book. Despite my only warning: Be prepared for a sad \\"ending\\", I would give this amazing book 5 stars.    I only use 5 stars on books I buy for my permanent library.  This book is part of my \\"all ages\\" library.    Would I/Did I buy it? Yes  Would I read it again? Yes  Would I recommend it to friends? Yes

B000F8O4DQ|5.0|Great art ages gracefully and A New World Record is no exception. ELO were seen as almost too perfectly poppy by some at the time, but in retrospect that's their crowning achievement, making strings and classical arrangements merged with perfect harmonies and good rock playing sound so crisply Beatlesque. And as fine as Out Of The Blue is, ANWR has that sheen of sheer bliss that marks very few recordings. If you love catchy melodies married to complex arrangements, this is heaven. The gorgeous opera chorus on Rockaria, that cavernous drum break on Do Ya, perhaps Lynne's best vocal ever on Telephone Line (an underrated singer, I've always thought), the weirdly entrancing So Fine...there's not a weak moment in any of these nine tracks. Sweetness.<br /><br />I was offered whatever album I wanted for graduating grade six 34 years ago, and I chose this puppy. I played the hell and heaven out of it, and when I pulled ANWR out last week (in the original embossed cover, sigh I miss those vinyl days) and gently laid it on the old turntable, the myriad pops and crackles among the soaring melodies took me back to those younger days in a flash, and what glorious memories they are. Music can transcend all else if you listen intently enough, and this album sure took me there in 1977, and it still takes me there today. I can't ask much more from art than that.<br /><br />Unless it's even more of it! This remaster not only sounds wonderful but has a number of crisp extra tracks, including a lovely new vocal mix of Telephone Line, and interesting alternate mixes of Do Ya and Mission. Surrender is a pleasant tune but hardly matches the rest of the album, sounding more like Discovery-era Lynne. And I sure would have loved new versions of In The Clouds and the incomparable Shangri-La, my favorite tracks. But I'm glad to get what's here, above all the new sound supervised by the maestro himself. Though when I put it up against my old vinyl, I've got to say you still can't beat the warmth and glow of good vinyl on a good table, even when the record has 34 years of blissful listening in its grooves.<br /><br />However you hear it, make sure to give A New World Record a spin and see how well it's held up.<br />Thanks for the memories, Jeff!od vinyl on a good table, even when the record has 34 years of blissful listening in its grooves.

0375714839|5.0|I wish there were more comics like Persepolis. The storytelling is gritty, piercing and yet also uplifting and humorous. It moves much like the waves, and is very much an organic piece of writing. You truly feel you're experiencing the details of Satrapi's life as you make your way through the book.<br /><br />At first I was a bit disappointed by the black and white panels because Iran has such an interesting cultural history that I thought could benefit from color and details. However, shortly after getting into the book you realize there was no better medium to illustrate the \\"no shades of grey\\" attitudes apparent in Post-Revolution Iran. The simple illustrations are more than enough, growing with her as she herself grows.<br /><br />The story between Satrapi and her uncle always hits me when I read this book, and it always brings me to tears. It's just one of the examples of the highs and lows this book will bring out in its readers.<br /><br />Comics are not just for children, and this is a perfect example of that.  And if the Islamic Republic is condemning it, you know that it's telling the truth they don't want outsiders to see. If you haven't read it, you're doing yourself an amazing injustice.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|I wanted to own a Blu-Ray DVD to be able to show the capability of my new LCD and Blu-Ray player and this Iron Man DVD serves that purpose well, so I'm happy with that.  I had seen the movie before so I knew what to expect.  What really pleased me was that the supplier, which was capcityoutlet.com, filled the order right away with no delay, it was packed very well and arrived in perfect playing condition, which was my main concern.  Based on this order I can highly recommend capcityoutlet and would order from them again.
B0041KKYEM|3.0|It was not what I thought it would be like.  It was more of a mental thriller.  It was slow throughout the movie and hard to keep yourself interested in it.   It will take watching it more than once to give it a proper review. I would have liked to see more action.  The best part was just the one scene when she turned into the Black Swan.
B001AQT0ZO|3.0|In fairness to the director, I perosnally don't think modern society could handle a straight from the book adaptation of this great story, the language barrier along will turn some off the this awesome story, on top of that movies today rely on action to keep a movies chugging along. Thus I believe the director knew this thus parts of this film are edgey or over the top. So the puriest will rant the modern viewer will rave and the rest of us take the middle ground. By the way for parents looking for a much more differnet take on this story I recommend \\"Gnomeo and Juliet\\" for them it has a happy ending.

1563899426|5.0|This is a graphic novel series I have been wanting to read forever.  I really enjoyed this first book; it's basically an investigative urban fantasy featuring fairy tale characters.  The illustrations are beautiful and the story is very well done.<br /><br />All the characters from fairy tales and fables have been thrown out of their homelands and are now residing in Fabletown in the human world.  The Big Bad Wolf is a detective who is told by Jack that Snow White's sister, Rose Red, has been murdered.  Now it is up to Wolf (big bad wolf) and Snow White to track down who the real killer is before the big Remembrance Day gala.<br /><br />The illustrations are in full color and absolutely stunning; they are done in a very classic comic book type style.  The story is also very well put together.  It is mainly an investigative detective story.  I loved the twists and turns in the plot and was constantly surprised by which character from Fable I would encounter next.<br /><br />The book definitely has a dark tone to it and is definitely meant for adults (there is some sexual content and swearing).<br /><br />Overall I really enjoyed this book.  I was excited to read it and it actually exceeded my expectations.  Lots of fun, a great story, and beautiful illustrations.  I can't wait to read the next installment in this series, [[ASIN:140120077X Fables Vol. 2: Animal Farm]].

B00005JNJV|4.0|While it has its fair share of silly, over-the-top moments, Batman Begins was quite an enjoyable experience. My complaint has to be Rachel (the \\"girlfriend\\"); the actress portraying her could have done better, the character herself wasn't likable in the least, and her only redeeming attribute was the fact that she was Bruce's childhood friend (and that she offered a couple of fortune cookie advices). Otherwise, her only purpose seemed to be saying things she had no right to say, fitting the role of worried but strong woman for the hero to save, and turning on her headlights at will. Yawn.     This story HAS to be told, and the ending left a nail-biting cliffhanger to The Dark Knight (which, I must admit, is the sole reason I bought THIS movie in the first place). Many scenes were done well, and I enjoyed the action sequences. The famous parents scene near the beginning brought tears to my eyes, especially when young Bruce was sitting in the police station. I'm sensitive, but it takes a special piece of cinematography to make me feel such empathy. Setting aside typical superhero movie flaws, such as mediocre background acting and goofy little lines, Batman Begins is a fun ride and I know I'll watch it more than once. Amazon delivered it promptly and in great condition. Hope this review was helpful; I nitpick, but it really is a great movie and I recommend it to any Batman lover because it does the franchise justice!
B004XUDJII|4.0|I had the good fortune of seeing Ms. Perri perform live this past Sunday 5/8/2011 in Seattle.  My wife and I both wanted the album after her set.  While she was great live, the album is way better, with excellent recordings of terrific songs.  \\"lovestrong\\" is one of those pleasant exceptions where every track is strong ... and contrary to another reviewer's impression, I find a range of experiences here.  \\"Penguin,\\" for example, is my wife's favorite, and my least favorite, and quite different from \\"Jar of Hearts,\\" which is still my own favorite.
0786890762|4.0|This book was sweet, romantic, and original.  The entire book is a series of letters with no other narrative, which in itself is really unique.    This is the story of Rosie and Alex, who have been the best of friends since childhood.  They both feel strongly for each other, but timing and various situations continue to keep them from being more than friends throughout their entire lifetime.  Despite their own doubts and fears, everyone else in their lives seems to realize that they were meant from each other.  It takes a long time and a great many experiences for them to see the light themselves.    The first letters between the two are exchanged at 6 years old, and the book continues over the next 50 years.  Not all of the letters are between only Rosie and Alex.  Many of the letters occur between friends and family as well.  Much happens over the years:  relationships, marriages, children, job opportunities, and relocations.  By the end of the book, the letters have progressed from handwritten in crayon to emails and texts and voicemails.     The author does a great job of letting the relationship grow and change in a very realistic way.  Misunderstandings and insecurities get in the way just like with real people.  I felt like I knew these people and wanted them to find happiness.  If someone told me this had been a true story, I would have believed it.      This book is a perfect mood-lifter kind of story.  Read it after a long tough day when you need a little pick-me-up.
0847835073|4.0|It is not often that books on beauty photography concentrate solely on one subject (of course, there are a few - Rankin's \\"Heidilicious\\" and his \\"Ten TImes Rosie\\" come to mind) but such is the case with \\"Monica Bellucci\\" (Rizzoli), the italian model turned actress who is the subject of a new photographic compendium spanning twenty years of work. In demand as both an actress and a model in her native Italy, Bellucci had the good fortune to be shot by many of the world's top photographers - Helmut Newton, Avedon, Bruce Weber, Steven Meisel, Mondino, Ellen Von Unwerth, and many others - and this volume captures the remarkable history of one of the world's most impressive portfolios. While mostly black and white (with some color, for sure) the strength of the book lies in both the who's-who of photographers as well as the evolution of the subject herself. What comes across in the final overview is the openness and receptivity that Bellucci brings to her work. Like a modern day Sophia Loren, the actress radiates Italian style. That so many were able to avail themselves of the opportunity to work with her (and she with them) is what makes this volume even possible.

B004Q7DQLS|3.0|I've been seeing a lot of people recommending this book as a fantastic read. I must say I wasn't that impressed.<br /><br />The premise was good. The book opens with Pia Giovanni basically running for her life. Her ex boyfriend managed to blackmail her into stealing something from Dragos, a very powerful dragon. We find out during the course of the book that her mom told her to hide before she died, and taught her the means to do so.<br /><br />I think my issue with the book had a lot to do with the characters' interactions. Dragos seemed alternately wooden in speech and mannerisms, then would randomly throw out cool-sounding slang. I never really got a handle on his personality.<br /><br />Pia was the same way. In the opening chapters, she's depicted as a \\"good girl\\" who fell into a bad situation, and on several occasions there were long monologues on how she just felt so bad about having to hurt people to save herself. But then, like Dragos, she'd randomly start yelling, screaming, and generally  throwing hissy fits.<br /><br />The characterisations gave me whiplash, to the point that it was difficult to enjoy the pretty awesome plotline. I just didn't get a good feel for Pia and Dragos's motivations behind many of their actions.<br /><br />Based on the other ratings, I was in the minority on this, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.

It was penned by Pete Townsend to be sung by Roger Daltrey, the final line of the final song on the original album release of `Who's Next' (WN).

The book has graphic points but don't be deterred, the first book is not as graphic as its counterparts  but the time should be taken to read this trilogy in completion.

0316098329|5.0|\\"Room\\" is an amazing book! It's narrated by Jack, a five-year-old boy who has spent his entire life living in an 11 foot x 11 foot prison with his Ma. The mother-son duo are prisoners of Old Nick, a man who kidnapped Jack's Ma when she was just 19 years old. Despite the horrendous circumstances, Jack's Room is the only home he has ever known, and his Ma has done everything she can to build a \\"normal\\" life for the two of them. As Jack gets a little older, he learns that there is a whole world outside of Room that includes things like fresh air, other people, etc. Understandably, it's a lot for a little kid to take in.<br /><br />I was blown away by this novel, which is a story about love, survival, and humanity. It's incredibly moving and unlike anything I've ever read before...I couldn't put it down! I highly recommend it.

1416550550|5.0|Three women, Eliza, Nell, and Cassandra, of different generations, are on a journey of discovery.  Each travels to a cottage on the Blackhurst Manor estate in Cornwall.  Eliza is plucked from a Dickensian childhood in the late 1800s to her rightful home at Blackhurst, where her mother was the apple of her brother's eye.  Eliza becomes the companion of Rose Mountrachet at the manor, but retires to the cottage when her role as Rose's confidante is filled by Rose's new husband.  Eliza is known as the Authoress, writing fairy tales that stem from the experiences of her own rags-to-almost-riches life.  Nell is a child in the first chapter of the book, abandoned by the Authoress on a ship bound for Australia.  On her 21st birthday, the man who raised her tells her that he is not her father and that he knows nothing about Nell's real family.  This revelation sets Nell on a quest to discover her roots and the reason for her solo voyage long ago, armed just with a first edition of Eliza's collection of fairy tales that was in her suitcase on the ship.  While in England, she recognizes Rose's portrait as that of her mother and proceeds to buy Eliza's cottage, with the full intention of moving there from Australia.  However, an abandoned child comes into her own life--her granddaughter Cassandra.  When Nell dies, leaving her the cottage, Cassandra, too, travels to Cornwall and finds that restoring the garden at the cottage helps restore her own life, providing a distraction from the well of grief that she has sunken into.  This novel is sort of a braid of these three women's lives that Morton unwinds for us, just as Cassandra untangles the overgrowth and the secrets of the cottage.  The book is slightly confusing, in that it is difficult to keep up with each woman's progress in fitting together the pieces of the puzzle, but it doesn't really matter who is unraveling what. Fortunately for the reader, Morton heads up each chapter with an approximate date, so that we at least know whose story we are about to resume.  This book reminds me of A. S. Byatt's Possession, one of my all-time favorites, but with occasional fairy tales, rather than poems, interspersed throughout the book.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|I've read the Jeeves & Wooster books several times over and have never seen a production on film, television or stage that interprets the original work better than this!  The casting is wonderful, the story lines are true to the originals and it makes for pleasant light entertainment.  The members of the Drones Club are just as silly as you want them to be for 'taking the piss' on the upper class, Aunt Agatha just as imposing as the grande dame she was written to be and Jeeves, well Jeeves is perfect.  It is also nice to see Hugh Laurie playing the empty headed Wooster with all the bumbling aplomb of the original character.  Please don't expect heavy entertainment because if you do, you will be sorely disappointed.  If you love the original books, however, it is like sitting down and having a visual reunion with an old friend.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|I may be giving this movie 4 stars, but this will not be a glowing review. HARRY POTTER has one story. Throughout the entire series, there has been one central theme: Boy learns magic and comes closer to his destiny to face off against evil. Did it take 8 movies to get there? Not to say that I didn't enjoy all of the movies, HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1, really hammers this point home for me as it ends dramatically and quite ceremoniously as if to say.... \\"Come back again folks. Thanks for your cash.\\" This was just one more TEASER film building up to the payoff.<br /><br />I enjoy the HARRY POTTER movies. Don't get me wrong. Yet, it's like a bunch of movies centered around subplots building up to what is finally coming next in HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 2. Resolution. Finale. I don't know if I want to say, \\"Thank God.\\" or wish there were more movies coming. I think it's \\"Thank God.\\"<br /><br />HARRY POTTER is the STAR WARS of this era, and I think they had more tact and circumstance then the STAR WARS series had, but both series made entire movies out of less than important story lines.<br /><br />DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 is an okay movie in a series of good movies that are meandering and sometimes pointless but ultimately entertaining and good. PART 1 spends too much time being dramatic and world ending and hammering on the point that we should be afraid, very afraid. In doing so, it ultimately bores children who have been following the series to death and bores people like me who want the payoff to hurry up and get here for godsakes.<br /><br />DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 2 better not disappoint because we've sat through 7 movies of subplot to get here... sheeesshh.

B003N0XDT4|4.0|I didn't know what to expect from this product.  Luckily, this product that came in looks like a E7 and is genuine.  The box is mix of english/japanese as well as the instructions.  Let me point out the things I don't like about this.  This product was partly easy to setup.  In Windows 7, took me a while to find where to change the audio source, which is in the control panel.  For Windows XP, I had to do the same thing, but the sound didn't change right away.  I think I had Windows Media Player playing something, so there were some conflicts.  I had to unplug and replug the USB for the computer to recognize.  Now to review the sound.  On my desktop, I have a little bit of sound processing software, which when switching from the DAC and the regular sound output, the Fiio did poorly. I'm using a Grado SR-60.  The sound was really dull and didn't sound as good as the regular output, but when switching to using just the amplifier (line in/line out), it sounded amazing.  I went to try this on my Windows XP laptop, and I'm using the DAC/amplifier combo, and the sound was truly amazing.  I feel the sound was a lot more lively.  On my laptop, I'm using etymotic hf3.  Is it because I'm using different earphones why it sounded horrible on my desktop but good on my laptop?  If I wanted to be picky, I know this thing can have a lot more improvements in the sound category, but for this price, I don't think you can ask for more.  The interface is great and the design is pretty slick.  This is something very nice and slim I can use for work so I have a good audio source to listen to music.

An hour later and I had finished the book and was on my way to hunting down the next and then the next. This book is a fantasy thriller that beautifully displays an amazing story line and amazing characters. The series has been a keeper from the very beginning and I have been in love with it ever since. Definitely a must read of the summer as well as the prequel novel, The Clockwork Angel. Both amazing reads and a must follow series.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|An exceptional movie my an exceptional young man. Josh Fox has created a masterpiece of investigative journalism, founded on a journey of the heart to the Heartland, out of an innate curiosity, and a deep respect for the land and watershed passed down to him by his family. This is a must-see for anyone who cares about this country and its most sacred resource - Water. Please buy this DVD and share it with neighbors and friends (I have two copies). It's a critical time to do so.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|Hello i would just want to warn everybody wanting a cheap mic that will give good quality sound that this is NOT a good mic. I have a canon 550D and i have found that the built in mic on the camera gives better sound than this. There is a TON of noise in the background too! An other annoying thing I found is that this mic only records in MONO (coming out of only one side of the speaker). Although it can be fixed while editing, it still doesn't match up to a stereo mic. The only positive thing that comes out of this is the long extension cord. I would still recommend saving up for a RODE video mic (150$) because it is really worth the money!!
0767817664|5.0|Chris Sarandon (THE SENTINEL, CHILD'S PLAY) is fantastic as Jerry Dandridge, the vampire who moves in next door to young Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale). Of course, no one believes Charley's claims that Dandridge sleeps in a coffin and fulfills his blood-lust by night. FRIGHT NIGHT is a great vampire film, and one of the better horror movies to come out of the 80s. The explosive finale is reason enough to watch this gem! Roddy McDowall (PLANET OF THE APES, IT, POSEIDON ADVENTURE) adds humour and class to the mix as cheeezy TV host Peter Vincent. Add this to your neck-chomper shelf...
B004QK5N5W|3.0|Like others have noted, this AV adapter should only be used with the iPad 2 for mirroring and watching movies such as on Netflix. I chose to purchase this adapter because HDMI cables carry both audio and video unlike VGA cables which only do video. However, the Netflix quality is noticeably inferior on the TV when using the iPad compared to my other Netflix streaming devices such as my PS3 and Blu-Ray player.      I tried to be a little fancy and connected my camera connection kit to the Apple pinout (this adapter has an HDMI port and an Apple pinout), but the iPad did not recognize the camera or the SD memory card. The pinout can only be used for charging and nothing more. Even though Apple made it clear that the pinout is for charging the iPad, it is still a shame because other accessories could have easily been supported if Apple made an effort to do so.     Overall, the cable does its job but not in a spectacular way. I really thought I would use this adapter often, but the mediocre video output quality and the one-dimensional functionality of this promising product has caused me to only use this only for \\"emergency\\" situations.

0061726826|5.0|First off I'm only half way through the book, I have never felt the urge to review any novels I read for pleasure(I read a lot)before. Even so, I just wanted to express my feelings on this book. I am technically a young adult but book lovers usually read a level up from where they are really at. My teens years are almost up so I've been sort of ashamed to read anything labeled \\"teen\\" or \\"young adult\\". Honestly someone in theirs 60s could easily enjoy this book. Its intense and fast paced at times. Oliver has done the impossible, made love stories new, In a world of millions of run of the mill love story involved novels. She created a world where love doesn't really exist, or is outlawed, in doing so she has created a setting for a fresh new look at love as something great, not at all cheesy, and something we should be grateful for. What she has done here is quite simple yet quite genus. Delirium isn't just a love story, it is a wonderfully subtle dytopia about a girl and her realization of the backwards society she lives in. Its about freedom and awaking also. I looooooooooooooooooooooove dytopia's and this one Oliver has created, the New Portland, is so relatable. The writing is wonderful also, Oliver is no Stephenie Meyer. The language itself is enough to send your emotions into a whorl wind. I found myself highlighting certain phrases that I found beautiful a lot, which I NEVER do on a non assigned no non course work novel. I don't want to say too much because I don't want to spoil any of the story. I want you to read this novel you will not be disappointed. I cannot put it down.      P.S. It needs to be turned into a movie!
B004DMIIUU|5.0|This movie caught my eye, as I have been trying to increase my Foreign Film collection.  I have always been curious with anything that has to do with Japanese history (especially the unification period).  It literally grabbed my attention in the first minute and a half, and never let go.  The time period this movie is based on was one full of civil strife and unrest for Japan, with class and rank clearly defined and Feudal Lords constantly fighting for power to control the whole country.  And while the movie stylizes the mood and scenery greatly in regards to these things, it still held some historical accuracy.  Most of the main characters in the movie actually existed during this time period:  Oda Nobunaga, Mitsuhide Aketchi, Hideyoshi Toyotomi, Ieyasu Tokogawa, Hitori Hanzo.  I'm sure there are more, but those are the ones I caught.<br /><br />Many of the reviews have brought up the utter beauty of the landscape and architectural design.  Needless to say, I am on the same side of the fence.  Scenes in the forest FEEL like a forest, scenes in a castle FEEL like a castle, and so on.  Sometimes you DO feel like it's obvious you're looking at a green screen or floor.  But it all seems integrated smoothly with the actors/actresses utilizing that space, so you don't end up paying attention to it that closely.  The sets are busy; lots of extras wandering around and adding \\"life\\" to the background.  The colors are vibrant and the sound is crisp and clear.  My only qualm with quality is that the English dub track sounds a bit \\"goofy,\\" whereas the Japanese track is emotional and feels more decisive.  Also with the Japanese track, you get 6.1 surround instead of Eng 5.1.....not a huge difference if you don't have the extra speaker.<br /><br />The action is frequent and fast!  Obviously, as one can see from the preview, the scope of realism is stretched.  But what good are action sequences that abide by all natural laws of physics?! Joking....but the action is good.  Some shots are up close and a little cluttered, but others are even paced and use a lot of form.<br /><br />To sum it up, this movie really took my breath away with an, albeit, LOOSE historical relevance, but historical nonetheless. The combination of action, drama, atmosphere, mood, and dialog progresses the movie fluidly and you may be surprised by how many times you catch yourself saying \\"ah\\" or \\"wow.\\"<br /><br />***on a side note* If you are looking for any literature regarding the subject matter of this time period in Japanese history, I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend \\"TAIKO.\\"  It is a very detailed, and very long book (but worth the read) regarding the deep  relationship between Hideyoshi Toyotomi and the majority of those listed in the first paragraph of this review.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|The item I ordered arrived several days before it was estimated to arrive. The seller included a note with his contact information in case I was displeased at all with my purchase. I'd never seen anyone else on the site do this and I thought it was great customer service. I've already watched every episode of the entire DVD collection. It's a fabulous set and I'm so glad I was able to find it for such a steal. I was very pleased with every aspect of this transaction and I definitely plan on buying from this seller again!

B004IQMXD4|5.0|Great variety. Wide Sargossa Sea really stays in your head. Very catchy. In Your Dreams is an upbeat classic and New Orleans is haunting. A really great album. My issues are with the record company. Why have they chosen to hold the album release back 7 weeeks in the UK? And the US version has an FBI Warning on it. I do not expect to pay good money plus P&P of an equal amount to be treated like a criminal. Muppets like the ones in Warner Bros do not deserve to have creative talent like Stevie Nicks recording with them.They even emailed me as a SN fan recommending I buy the album from them for 24.99! On a positive note, well done Dave Stewart formerly of the Eurythmics who has made a great collaboration.

B004ZISVWC|5.0|Presented as the lost tapes from a group of college kids, who disappeared while filming a documentary in the mountains of Norway, Trollhunter is a fascinating film. The armature filmmaking technique lends itself to the drama and anxiety of the film. I enjoyed the pacing which never ramped up to far and always seemed to create an even tension that kept you wanting to look ahead to the next scene. The film is actually very tame with limited violence of which most is implied and no foul language (even if there was the movie is in Norwegian and is subtitled). The special effects were very believable and not overused; I appreciated the use of the camera and sound effect editing to induce fear as much as seeing any of the beasts. With any movie you could start asking too many questions and pull apart the believability of it but I think if you are looking to be entertained the story is actually put together rather well and isn't just an excuse to scare you or to show you trolls. I would watch this movie again and again.
B001UV4XHY|1.0|I hardly remember the book and this movie did little to refresh my memory. I do recall how Rowling wasted 200 pages with Hermione & Harry apparating around the country doing NOTHING, and the overall impression of being underwhelmed by the story (or lack thereof).     I thought they would cut short all the Harry & Hermione \\"on the run\\" sequence from the book since it doesn't do anything to advance the story. But I was so wrong.  There is  what seems like 12 hours of nothing but H&H camping, again doing nothing to advance the story.    There is so little action, so little dialog and so many slow-moving scenes that I couldn't watch the whole thing.  I started fast forwarding after about an hour that felt like half a day and only watched scenes where people actually talked to each other (rather than just staring at each other) or some action, no matter how meager, was taking place.    I did enjoy the \\"Three Brothers\\" sequence. The animation was very interesting and unusual.  As for the rest of the film I recommend that if you must see it, you rent it or see at a theater, but don't waste your money on buying it.
0307346617|5.0|This book provides such a real first person perspective on a world that has seen the worst disaster befall it.  The idea of a collection interviews has given such a reality to story, that at moments, I cringed almost believing they had happened.    The story not only shows a world that has been decimated by a lack of planning and willingness to accept the unbelievable, but during the struggle to overcome the zombie apocalypse, there is hope.  There is the will to endure and come together, not as individual nations or races, but as the human race, fighting for a future with them in it.    I can't say anymore in fear of giving away a great collective story of a world that survived the worst world war ever.  What i will say, is if Max Brooks writes anything else, I'm getting it!
0956827802|1.0|This book is a joke - literally! 200 blank pages about what men think about apart from sex?! Come one! Good for a party laugh, but not for real insights!

B004RJMUJO|3.0|This was an interesting diversion - for about 5 minutes or so. It also did not run especially well on my phone (Motorola Cliq, which has an underpowered processor and limited memory by current standards), which I don't fault the game for (it's the phone) but does detract from enjoying the slicing of fruit. As a freebie, this is a reasonable diversion, but I wouldn't pay for it, especially if you have a slightly older phone. I don't like the humor of Gallagher either, so I suppose it's no surprise I didn't care much for this game...
B0042EJD8A|5.0|A very well done documentary.  All information is presented in a practical, empirical, and scientific manner. I dislike a lot of other social, environmental, and political documentaries because they over-dramatize the presentation of events and facts so that it detracts from the important messages and information. This film follows through on every point in a logical manner, starting with the various causes of the problems and drawing all the lines to the various ramifications.  The narrator allows you to see his own process of learning and discovery.  If you didn't care about how gas is harvested before, you will after seeing this.  Sure gas burns clean but the manner in which its being extracted now is just as damaging to people and environment as any other fossil fuel.
B004Q1FDHO|5.0|I downloaded this when it was the free app of the day and thought it would be stupid. I was wrong. Great graphics and a lot of fun. Works great on the Thunderbolt. Definitely worth a dollar.
B0002EXH4A|5.0|This is a classic!!!!! Due to infighting with pretty boy guitarist,(Jeff Young),and other things this album went under the radar, big time! Every song is great, NO Filler!!! Begins and ends amazingly! The guitar playing is more \\"Lead Worthy) lots of cool licks! This to me is second only to \\"Rust in Peace\\", So far also contains Megadeth's second best song \\"In my darkest hour\\" Second only to \\"Holy Wars/The punishment due\\" Great throughout! I only liked Wake up dead and Peace sells, From the \\"Peace Sells\\" album I got in 86. This album just has better production and songs!! Get this! I recommend it. Just do it!!!
B004QPOVF0|3.0|THE PROS:Looks and sounds great! And the performance was really good.Although im sure the vocals had to be slightly tweaked.    THE CONS:As another reviewer stated,way to many camera switches,split screens and audience shots.I want to see the band not some shirtless guy with his mug so up close in the camera that you can see his boogers.Disappointed in the filming of this.From now on im going to wait and read reviews on concert dvds before i purchase to make sure their not filmed this way.There's too many concert dvds out there like this and i hope it stops!Its sorta nauseating.    THE BOTTOM LINE:Get it to fill the gap in your collection if you have to but i would suggest just sticking to Live at Donnington or Plug Me In.Or better yet,save your money and put it on the great \\"Let there be rock\\" box set thats coming out.
0545123275|5.0|Shiver by Maggie Stiefvater is a YA romance novel about much more than werewolves. Stiefvater's vivid metaphors (\\"I saw storms destroying villages in her eyes\\"), telling descriptions (\\"...staring into her locker as if it contained other worlds\\"), classic allusions and captivating characters speaks to readers of and on many different levels. At it's core the story is about what many of us have dealt with or deal with daily; the struggle to be who we truly are... or perhaps the part of us we most want to be.           The first-person narration shifts from Grace's perspective to Sam's, offering a deeper understanding of the two main characters. Grace is a highly independent high school student that has more feedom than most, but is often trapped by her logic and willingness to forget her past. However, there is something from her past she won't forget, the day she was attacked by wolves and saved by her rescuer, her obsession, her wolf, Sam.       Sam is a werewolf that lingers in the woods behind her house during the winter months and vanishes once the warmer weather hits. His unmistakable yellow eyes and musky scent are a dead give-a-way when Sam is able to walk on two legs instead of four and finally gets the courage to talk to Grace. Their chemistry is one that has been brewing for years and is able to be more than silent stares in the backyard. The only problem is the seasons always change and colder weather threatens to take Sam away for good. In the short time that they have, Sam tries to break through the analytical walls that suppress the wolf blood running through Grace's veins. All the while Grace tries to let Sam know that she loves him... not in spite of who he is, because of who he is.      Although the first sight of the potential \\"antidote\\" to keeping Grace and Sam together is blatant and somewhat clumsy, the journey getting there is riveting and worthwhile. Shiver is the first book in the Wolves of Mercy Falls series and although some series books can leave the reader unsatisfied and unwilling to invest emotionally in book 2, Shiver ends by grabbing the reader in a warm embrace, easily ushering them into Linger.
B003L77G06|5.0|For those who know t.v. serials, most would agree that the king of sit-coms in recent history was \\"Arrested Development\\".  But that King has died.  Long live the new King--Modern Family.  It is rather ironic that the casting includes an icon of possibly the worst sit-com of all times, Ed O'Neill, from \\"Married With Children.\\"  As much as that show sucked, appealing to the lowest common denominator of newly-pubescent adolescents, Ed has redeemed himself with finally a mature role as the politically incorrect and curmudgeonly patriarch in Modern Family.  The casting is ideal.  The scripts are savvy.  The dialogue is crisp.  And the humor is effervescent.  The only slight criticism may be that they risk \\"gaying-up\\" the gay couple a bit too much.  Granted, it is funny, but it's a fine line between character and caricature.  The limp wrists, swishing and flamboyance is sometimes a little over the top and becoming too predictable.  The chemistry however, with all the character's is sublime.  I literally DVR every episode, watch it live, and then rewatch the DVR version twice.  It's like a shot of humor-cocaine injected directly into my funny bone.  If you like laugh out loud, tears down you cheeks, biting humor with a dose of even pathos on some occasions, this is the best sit-com on planet earth.

B002HWRYJE|1.0|I've been a fervent Trekker since September, 1966 when I was 11 years old and perched in front of a black & white TV to watch the original premiere of Captain Kirk and the intrepid crew of the starship Enterprise. After high school I was editor of my college newspaper and got press passes to the Star Trek Conventions (yes, they called them that and not just the generic \\"Sci-Fi Conventions\\" of today) and I met and interviewed, Leonard Nimoy, William Shatner, De Kelley, Jimmy Doohan, George Takai, Walter Koenig, Nichelle Nichols, and of course Gene and Majel Roddenberry. In the years that followed I watched the movies then the Next Generation, DS9, Voyager and even winced at Enterprise and thought that in the 4th season they were just getting interesting when they cancelled it.<br /><br />Then came Star Trek XI...<br /><br />I have never seen a bigger abortion of Star Trek in my entire life and if Gene Roddenberry was still alive he would have lined everyone up who was involved in the project starting with J.J. Abrams and Stooge-slapped the whole gang if he had go around the sound stage twice.<br /><br />This movie violated everything we know about Star Trek and did it like a huge bully. They turned Kirk into a boobie-honking drunk. They made Spock an emotional man-ho. Uhura became a slut. Scotty became a moron with midget for a sidekick. Sulu isn't Japanese anymore; he's Korean. Checkov is younger than Wesley Crusher when he wandered onto the bridge during the Farpoint Mission (Read that as: Put the safety pin in his diaper instead of \\"take the helm, Mr. Chekov\\").<br /><br />Leonard Nimoy's part seems to be mostly to point out who is \\"Kirk\\", who is \\"Scotty\\" and what the heck is \\"red matter\\"?<br /><br />If this were really Star Trek then the Temporal Enforcement from the Federation's future would have had a heart attack at the destruction of Vulcan, two Spock's in the same time same time period and a 20 year-old Kirk as a Captain of the Enterprise and sent a temporal enforcement team back before any of this started and reversed the timeline to take out Nero (A Romulan with a tattoo on his head?!? What happened to the Three Stooges 'Moe' haircut?) to stop this before it ever got as far as it did.<br /><br />I would have liked to think that the temporal agents would have sent an agent back to the 21st century to shoot J.J. Abrams because he killed Star Trek for me forever and turned it into a \\"sex, drugs, and rock & roll\\" moronic version of it's former self with no morality, no ethics, no storyline, no regard for the history of any of the former Star Trek's that came before it and to make matters worse Abrams made an appearance shortly after the 2009 film was released on Jay Leno's Tonight show and told the audience that he hated Star Trek and only did it for the money. He was booed off the stage.<br /><br />I think it's past time to re-boot the re-boot and bring Star Trek back to the real fans. Let's take it to about 400 years past the time of Picard and see what Starfleet is like?<br /><br />If bad films were a crime then Abrams would be guilty of a capital crime; the worst of all the Star Trek's ever made.started and reversed the timeline to take out Nero (A Romulan with a tattoo on his head?!?

B004SC8YH2|5.0|Christopher Cross's career arc reminds me a bit of Peter Frampton's as they both had iconic, multi-million selling albums containing hit songs that still get regular radio airplay to this day.  In the years following those explosive albums, both artists' cooled off from the white hot glare of the spotlight within the changing musical landscape.  Christopher & Peter have both continued to tour and release new music over the years while staying dedicated to their artistry & craft.  And after all this time, Frampton even won his first Grammy for an instrumental album he put out in 2006.<br />Christopher Cross has also stayed busy since the Grammy filled heyday of \\"Sailing\\" & \\"Ride Like The Wind\\" releasing 7 additional albums along with a greatest hits collection, a Christmas album and 2008's exquisite \\"Café Carlyle Sessions\\" featuring tasteful, scaled down jazz arrangements of his work throughout the years.  That brings us to his newest full album of original material in 12 years titled DOCTOR FAITH.  The immediate observation is that Christopher isn't trying to come off like he's still 29.  There's a wisdom and social consciousness within tracks like \\"Hey Kid\\"(featuring Eric Johnson on lead guitar) and \\"I'm Too Old For This\\" that shines a sorely needed light on how our culture accepts the previously unacceptable.  While this subject matter isn't usually what's expected on a Christopher Cross album, he and co-writer Rob Meurer execute this slippery slope with a fearless grace and truth.  The track \\"When You Come Home\\" returns listeners to more familiar, romantic waters with the gorgeous strings and plaintive melody of a man looking for redemption and a second chance in his relationship.  \\"November\\" is a delicate, bittersweet ballad about a couple coming to an end.  The uptempo \\"Leave It To Me\\" with its tip of the hat to the Chicago horn section tells the story of a poorly treated woman's male \\"pal\\" lending his support and possibly more.  The song \\"Doctor Faith\\" re-teams Christopher Cross and Michael McDonald on a track about the struggles of therapy and the search for inner peace as life is not always \\"sailing\\" seamlessly.  Other strong songs on the album include the amorous \\"Rescue\\", the quiet struggle of \\"Still I Resist\\" and the simple eloquence of \\"Prayin'\\".  All songs were composed by Cross and his writing partner Rob Meurer.<br />Almost 32 years after he first hit the scene, Christopher's amazing voice has not aged a day and still expresses melodic imagery with a clean resonance and unblemished tone.  Cross's lead guitar work is the only element that leaves me pining for more on this album.  Other musicians contributing masterfully are Dave Beyer on drums, Mark Browne on bass, David Mann on soprano sax & John Thomas on piano.  The lustrous strings and horns are arranged by Chris Walden and conducted by Walden & Jules Chakin. DOCTOR FAITH was produced by Christopher Cross<br />Listeners rediscovering Cross from 30 years ago will notice differences in the tone, subject and feel of this album.  If they try to listen with \\"fresh ears\\" and without nostalgic expectations, they'll be treated to the work of a true artist in his stride.<br /><br />Scott Gross<br />Inside Musicast.com
B004NWPMVS|4.0|\\"The Way of Kings\\" begins a weighty new fantasy series, called 'The Stormlight Archive' and is mainly concerned with war, war, war (\\"Fiddle-dee-dee. War, war, war; this war talk's spoiling all the fun at every party this spring. I get so bored I could scream\\") on a planet where the very rocks seem to come alive.  I read through the 1007 pages of this first installment (Don't ever fall asleep and drop this book on the cat in your lap), and I will be on the lookout for volume 2, in spite of the author's obsession with supernatural armor and swords that can be called out of nothingness.<br /><br />The world-building is one of this fantasy's strong points, especially the ecology of the rocky flora and fauna, and the mysterious little creatures called sprens.  The theology is interesting, too, although confusing.  The author's strongest suit is his characters.  He's got quite a large cast, and I really ended up caring what happened to them, especially Kaladin the bridge-runner, who is beaten down as far as a man can go, and who still manages to think and fight his way out of what looks to be his doom.  This book  belongs on the Commandant of the Marine Corps recommended reading list where \\"Ender's Game\\" already resides, as a treatise on what it means to be a leader.<br /><br />The main weakness in \\"The Way of Kings\\" is the author's overuse of flashbacks.  This book's got more flashbacks than Marcel Proust's \\"Remembrance of Things Past.\\"  They really bulk up the text and slow down the narration, especially since the reader already knows what's going to happen in the flashback, because it was foreshadowed in the main narrative.

0670021652|3.0|An interesting read and offers some food for thought rather than a formula or conclusions that will convince you of marriage.  I liked this, because the fact is, each person has to delve into it themselves to find the \\"reason\\" that makes sense to them.
B00005JMFQ|2.0|Love is a word/concept that has been trivialized in our post-modernist era, and this movie for the most part well documents the superficial and sometimes perverted behaviour now deemed to be \\"love\\".  Still the movie is humorous at times and also explores the sometimes negative consequences when \\"love\\" is the basis for deception and betrayal.  Unfortunately the down side to this movie is the for some unwanted unexpected surprises in terms of subject matter and nudity.  On the surface the movie looks like a run-of-the-mill romantic comedy but alas two of the characters who \\"fall in love\\" happen to meet while fully nude stand-ins for a porn movie.  Other questionable nudity leaves me wondering while, still, female actors are required to expose their boobs for a few brief moments as though this is actually essential to make the movie work.  Also the somewhat open dialogue involving the kid--especially in one of the deleted scenes--is a little problematic in my books.  In the end it could be said that there is much more in the way of lust and infatuation than love in this movie.
B0030ZOYHC|3.0|As a diehard Evangelion fan, 1.11 is hard to explain. It is neither a remake nor a re-imagining... it falls somewhere in between. 95% of the original is still intact, but the 5% cut out is what bothers me.<br /><br />PROS<br />- The animation is completely redone, but uses most of the original animation cells as reference so it's almost identical.<br />- Much improved visual effects and audio over the original.<br />- Added scenes, re-imagined scenes.<br />- Altered English script makes the plot a little more understandable.<br /><br />CONS<br />- English script slightly altered from original. There are many \\"special\\" lines that were altered for no apparent reason. And some of the humor is gone, like the \\"toothpicks\\" censor when Shinji is naked in Misato's apartment.<br />- Scenes have been cut or rearranged.<br />- Pacing is altered.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />I see 1.11 as a \\"supplement\\" to the original series. The two combined really complete the vision of Evangelion. But if you watch 1.11 first, you're really missing out on some stuff. Likewise, 1.11 includes lots of great scenes not included in the original. So watch the original first, then watch this.
0439023491|1.0|I can not say enough about all that is wrong with this series of books. The fact that they are so popular is a sad commentary on our society. Katniss becomes increasingly less sympathetic and less interesting as the series progresses. The author seems to think it necessary to put in every twist and turn she can possibly conceive of to keep you guessing. The author also clearly has no true knowledge of what is required of a people to become free and remain free. She plays lip-service to the idea of a democratic republic, but clearly knows nothing about what a true Democratic Repulic is(hint, America is no longer a democratic Repulic as it was intended to be), or what a people need to know and believe to remain free. These people aren't ready to have a free government. How she gets the good guy in the end is a puzzlement to me. Don't even get me started on the whole brain-washing tangent. (insert eye roll here). Why on earth is Katniss still reluctant to have children if the government has supposedly been set right and there are no longer hunger games???!!!! It doesn't even make sense. Honestly, the greatest sensation I had when I finished these books, was that I had just wasted my time and valuable brain space on this drivel! Don't waste your time. Go read a good book Like the time-tested ones in the classics section.
B004ZISN4S|5.0|This episode gets us back to what has made this show such a winner for the past 6 years, a masterful combination of compelling characterizations, a unique mystery to solve, and a great ensemble working together to make us laugh, make us cry, and give us a great story to enjoy! The old Booth and Bones romantic chemistry is re-growing, and all is right in the world. Starting with a silent witness unable to tell her story, a mysterious young teenage deaf girl, also unable to communicate verbally, the team must find the victim, identify the murderer, and figure out the young girl's identity and where she comes from. Dr. Brennan, the brilliant but socially challenged forensic anthropologist, Special FBI Agent, Seeley Booth, and their team have few clues to go on and the sole witness is unable and unwilling to share her story. They are not only able to do solve the crime, but they uncover and solve the mystery of the young woman's origins. We also see more of the back story of Booth and Brennan, moving them closer to the closing climax of Season 6 of this quirky, dark, but humorous and romantic criminal investigative series.

And, boy, was i wrong to dismiss Ms. Nick's creativity. She has come back like a pro with a wonderful work that contains new gems such as \\"New Orleans\\", \\"Italian Summer\\" the chart hit \\"Secret love\\" and the soon to become anthem \\"Soldier's angel\\". With a little big help from Eurythmic Dave Stewart, Stevie sails on the ocean of success once again. And am I so delighted to see her shine brighter than ever.

B0000047BA|3.0|I purchased this because I watched the movie and it has so many outstanding blues songs...Well, this CD doesn't have many of them, and it repeats alot.  The sound is great and the original movie is where I was first introduced to Roy Rodgers (who's CD I purchased afterwards also). The best song of the movie (at the end) is not on this CD, so I was disappointed...

B003ZSJ212|5.0|I can't give this item a review because, like every one else here, the item has not been made available yet for purchase. I thought I would write this review just to express how useless these Amazon reviews can be. Has anyone received this item yet? No, because it is still on preorder. So why are there so many reviews? I personally don't understand why people think their opinion counts as a review of an item they haven't received.
0780631684|3.0|This is the worst one out of the 3.  (didn't see part 4).  I liked this film better when I saw it years ago.  The reason I don't like it now is because it's not gory enough.  They didn't show any of the killings and it makes the movie pretty tame.  It's pg-13 for christs sakes.  The other 2 are much bloodier and my philosophy is if your going to make a horror film, MAKE IT BLOODY!

B00127RAJY|1.0|I did this workout religiously in the for 4-5 days a week.  I consider myself to be in very good shape and regularly exercise but thought I would give this video a try since my schedule was compressed and I had less time to workout.  Needless to say after 2-3 months I have strained one knee and tore a ligament in the other.  This video does not allow for muscle recovery time and is too fast of a pace to properly do the lunges, squats, etc.  Not to mention my thighs bulked up which wasn't quite the physique I was after. I am back to doing power walking, pilates, yoga and my own version of calisthenics.  Yet my knees still aren't the same 6 months later but least I have slimmed down without the bulk.  Not worth it.
B000957O82|1.0|A simplistic story about how \\"Hitch\\" (Will Smith) helps clueless clients make a good first impression. I was especially offended by the dominance of inter-racial dating - this was contrived, thrown in to have appeal to all segments of society to help make up for the lousy plot.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I lack the verbal descriptions of my peers. This is an excellent movie worthy of your money. I laughed, I (nearly) cried,  and was ready to watch another hour-and-a-half.

B004PGO25O|4.0|I'll download almost any free Kindle book, unless the review are really bad or it's obviously a romance novel. When \\"Do The Work\\" showed up free, I took it. I'd heard the name \\"Steven Pressfield\\" before, but it didn't register.<br /><br />Turns out he wrote a book that's somewhere on one of my reading lists, \\"The War of Art\\". Obviously, it's a take off on Sun Tzu's book, which is also on one of my reading lists.<br /><br />Do The Work is more of a manifesto than a book. It's mostly for creative types and entrepreneurs. I'm apparently neither, yet I try to incorporate skills from both realms into my growth. Someday, I may be ready for such lines of work.<br /><br />Do The Work is intended to be motivational. It gives a short and concise motivational overview of the creative process, the most important part being: \\"get started! Do it!\\" It's so easy to never get off the ground. But doubt and resistance are with you every step of the way, even to the point of shipping. The author mentioned a friend who wrote an entire book but never shipped it because of doubt.<br /><br />It covers tricks to keep yourself motivated and moving. It talks about how movies are broken down into 3 acts, and how to use that outline for other creative type work.<br /><br />I'd say, since it's free, just get it. Do The Work is a VERY short read. I may read a lot, but I don't read fast. I was able to read Do The Work during my commute to and from work today. No, I don't read while I'm driving. I slug. That is, I park my car in a commuter lot and jump in the car of somebody else who is driving to where I'm going because they need 3 people in the car to get in the HOV lane. I repeat the process coming home. On days when I need my car immediately after work for some reason, I drive in and pick up slugs. It's the perfect symbiotic system. Everybody wins. In any case, I started the book on my iPhone when I got in the car, and I finished it just as we were pulling up to the commuter lot after work. Less than an hour's reading at my pace, on an iPhone, in a moving car with periodic stops to look around and skip songs. It's quick and easy, and for the price of FREE, it might actually help you.an iPhone, in a moving car with periodic stops to look around and skip songs.

0810993139|4.0|I like the book Diary of a Wimpy Kid, written by Jeff Kinney, because it is a book which made me want to read more.   The book is not very long and it has a lot of pictures in it. To understand what is going one the whole time you have to read the whole thing. Once you do that you want to read the next book. I think the books get better when you get to the end of them. The main characters are Greg, Rodrick, Manny, and Rowley. Greg is the one telling the story and he is the one who is always getting picked on by his big brother. His big brother Rodrick is always picking on him and is in a band. His little brother Manny is always telling on him, trying to get him in trouble. Rowley is his best friend and is always acting like a little kid. With all the characters in the book I could probably relate to Rodrick not because he is in a band but because he is the older brother. I do pick on my brother but not as much as he does. I did like this book a lot and I can't wait to read book two and then finish the whole series.  I would recommend this book to people because it is a good book. You would like this book if like books that are not very long and are easy to follow. I think people could read this book it is good and I like it.

0393316041|4.0|Feynman, the physicist and Nobel prize winner, has been widely acknowledged to be a scientific genius.  In this book he shares numerous entertaining anecdotes about growing up, going to school, meeting girls, making discoveries and becoming a famous scientist.  Some of the stories are a bit shocking or disturbing, such as ones about trying to meet receptive girls in bars.  But these, perhaps, date the man to his time.  Most stories are truly entertaininfg and humorous, and will long be remembered.
B004ZQRVNY|5.0|As you become more familiar with using your Kindle, you'll quickly find that navigating through certain books and documents, particularly older works, is time consuming and often frustrating. Orthodoxy (with optimized chapter navigation) by G.K. Chesterton creates a simple fix for that pesky problem. The classic Orthodoxy with the convenience of chapter navigation makes searching quick and easy!
B002KYHZLQ|4.0|After reading the book, I'm still not sure if I liked it or not as a whole. There is some really unique world building in this story. However, I sometimes felt like specifically all of the active Gods became a detriment to the characters. Throughout the book, I felt like the characters weren't in full control, that they were all being pushed and pulled towards the climax of the story. They explain this in the book, but I just found it a little annoying. In general, this book just took me a long time to finish, I never found myself unable to stop turning the page. I enjoyed reading it, but I didn't love any part of the book. I'll probably eventually try out the second of the series, but I'm not in a hurry.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|I was excited to read this book, but should have read more than a couple good reviews before I paid for it.  I normally don't spend that much on e-books, but this one sounded like a good read.<br /><br />Now I am trudging through, intent on finishing it, not because it's awesome, I just want to justify the cost.<br />This is not a well written book, it is repetitive and boring.  I feel like I should be close to the end of the story by now, but my Kindle tells me I'm only at 33%.  I'm tired of reading the same silly metaphors over and over again.  Believe me, I remember that his touch is icy, and that his glance feels like snowflakes.  I was reminded 2 sentences ago, and every paragraph for the last 8 chapters.<br /><br />A bad pairing of bodice-ripper paperback bought at the local supermarket, and the supernatural.
B003UESJH4|5.0|A film about a speech impediment suffered by a reluctant king and his fight to overcome it with the help of his speech therapist and his wife forms the basis of the King's Speech. The King is George the VI or Bertie as he is known to close family and friends. He is accidentally thrust in to the role of a king when his bother decides to pursue love than ruling the country of Britain. It is wartime and Hitler is on the march, as expected the king is expected to give rousing speeches to rally his countrymen but this king can barely speak to his family, much less the country, without stammering. His wife (Helena Bonham Carter) arranges for him to see an Australian therapist Logue (Geoffrey Rush) who has had many success treating soldiers in his native land.<br />Colin Firth as the king and Geoffrey Rush as his therapist, act superbly and these folks alone make it worth the watch, play two reluctant people who much conquer the differences of class and status, eventually becoming lifelong friends. Colin Firth is simply amazing and gives one of the year's best performances; he is matched step for step by Geoffrey Rush.  Helena Bonham Carter is refreshing and gives credence to the meaning that behind every great man is a equally great woman. Tom Hooper directs amazingly well and the cinematography is equally superb. The supporting actors are well chosen and so is the music by Alexandre Desplat. This movie is one of the reasons that we see movies and evokes inspiration and respect. I missed watching it in theaters, regrettably so, but I have seen it twice on DVD already. Five stars. Highly recommended. 4/28/2011

If anyone is planning to buy this,then you should definitely invest on the SD Card.
1439133948|4.0|I've never read Lois McMaster Bujold before. So logic follows, I've never read a Vorkosigan Saga novel either.  It's hard to believe given how long I've been reading speculative fiction, but Bujold never jumped out at me.  When the 2011 Hugo Nominees were announced and Bujold was once again among the nominations, I decided it was time to give her a shot.  I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Some negative reviews have been written about Cryoburn.  Most of them seem to be from long standing Vorkosigan Saga (or Bujold) fans complaining that Cyroburn doesn't measure up to the previous novels.  After reading it, I can strongly say that is patently unfair.  To judge this novel, against her others does a disservice to a great writer.  Is this Bujold's worst Vorkosigan Saga novel?  I have no idea.  If so, I'm immediately purchasing all 13 previous ones.<br /><br />Cryoburn takes place on Kibou-daini, a planet where nearly everyone is voluntarily placed in cryogenic storage prior to death in hopes that technology will be developed to extend life.  This in itself is not unusual.  The wrinkle is that while individuals are frozen, they are not dead, and thus still have the right to vote which is now tacitly controlled by the corporation responsible for their storage.  One of these corporations is in the process of expanding their business model off-planet to Komarr, a planet of significant strategic advantage to the Barrayarran Imperium.  Our main character, Miles Vorkosigan, is tasked by the Barrayarran Empire to visit Kibou and investigate the corporation.  Shenanigans ensue.<br /><br />At its heart, Cryoburn is a caper book.  Miles, the mastermind, plots the downfall of a corrupt corporation who has exploited the little people.  It's also a family story centered on two young children separated from their mother.  The pace of the novel is slow as Miles and his bodyguard Roic sort through local politics and family squabbles.  There is almost no action, but it is warm, suspenseful, and funny.<br /><br />Many of the undercurrents throughout the novel center around life, death, and rebirth.  Freezing someone before they die prompts a lot of questions about how we view life.  It becomes clear that many of those who opted to freeze themselves did so without the true expectation of ever waking up.  It's a fearsome concept particularly enhanced, I think, by the opening scene of Miles walking blind through endless corridors of frozen corpses(?).  As in any great novel, the ending ties into these themes of life and death perfectly.  But be warned, the ending - along with some of the other Miles centric moments - fell short for me as a Vorkosigan newbie.<br /><br />Is Cryoburn a worthy addition to the Hugo nominees?  Yes and no.  Bujold is a master.  Cryoburn certainly exhibits that fact.  It's beautifully put together and has all the elements of a brilliant novel.  From that stand point, it deserves all the recognition it gets.  It is difficult, however, to call something the best novel of 2010 when so much of the emotional content is in many ways predicated on knowing what has come before.<br /><br />In any case, I very much enjoyed Cryoburn even as a newcomer to the Vorkosigan Saga.  I'm sure it's not the best entry point, but I would recommend it to anyone - including those new to Bujold.ndercurrents throughout the novel center around life, death, and rebirth.

B004IQMXD4|3.0|For as imaginative as Stevie Nicks can be, it's really her producers (especially Lindsey Buckingham) who give her music the atmosphere. Stevie always functions best when they give her lots of it. Just listen to  \\"Gypsy\\", \\"Edge of Seventeen\\",  \\"Sara\\". I think her producer here (Dave Stewart/Eurythmics) figured that out. This is one of her better collection of songs, and for as rough as her voice can sound, she sounds pretty good here.

0307595862|4.0|If you're bored with those unrealistic novels where the protagonist is always right then this may be the book you've been waiting for.<br /><br />This is a serial killer novel, set in a country where serial killers are an anomaly and the only detective experienced in dealing with them has a less than stellar reputation with his peers.<br /><br />Detective Inspector Harry Hole is smart, but he has a bad habit of doing things his own way. He's also an alcoholic and bitter over a failed relationship with the woman he loves, adding further complications to his life and job.<br /><br />Hole and his team are investigating a series of disappearances and subsequent murders of married women. Early on we learn Hole received a taunting letter, apparently from the killer dubbed \\"The Snowman,\\" and snowmen are found at a number of the crime sites.<br /><br />The author dishes up tantalizing clues, a series of red herrings and an assortment of suspects whom Hole, his associates and bosses target as The Snowman before arriving at the real culprit with a nail-biting conclusion.<br /><br />Some are already seeing Hole as the successor to Henning Mankell's Wallander. They may not be wrong.

B00006RSM1|1.0|Might be a great album but you will listen to it on a CD/DVD/BluRay player or not at all.  Apparently has a poison pill in it with all the extra crap to prevent ripping to MP3.  Tried three rippers; no luck.  I personally find this flaw to be fatal.
0142000671|4.0|Normally, books or movies don't make me cry but this American classic novella by John Steinbeck brought tears to my eyes. The relationship between small George and big dumb Lennie was complicated. George looked after Lennie and I could only imagine his horror in making a decision that would affect both their lives in the end of the novel.     The writing is Steinbeck's style. It can be descriptive and detailed about life in California. He uses actual dialect in his writing. This book is used in schools obviously to introduce students to Steinbeck's writing style and plot.     The story of Lennie and George is about friendship and family ties. Sometimes, you don't need to be with actual relatives. George promised to take care of Lennie, the lovable giant. Anyway, this book is short and not an easy read. I found the book to be entertaining and enlightening but also tragic, sad, and realistic too.
B004LAIU4I|5.0|I am a big fan of Simon and Garfunkel, and was a big fan of Paul Simon through his first three solo efforts. Well, actually his first two and then I liked number three but felt it wasn't quite a good. Then he really went through some style changes and I didn't care for them too much. When I found out about his release, I listened to the 30-second samples on the Amazon product page, liked what I heard, and so I listened to the CD in its entirety using the Rhapsody music service.    Well, I liked what I heard there. I kept listening to it over and over so I figured I might as well buy the CD, which I did. This is nothing at all like his first three CD's but for me, everything comes together just baby-bear right. There's a nice variety of styles, his voice is in good form as are the other vocalists he has on here, and I love the rhythms, the melodies and the lyrics. One reviewer criticized this work as having nothing but emphasis on rhythm with no melodies but I disagree - there's both and they work very nicely together. It sounds like they had a lot of fun putting the CD together.  There's a high level of musicianship, vocals, and they just sound comfortable.  I'm really glad I bought this - it's a top rate effort.
0061433047|5.0|Summary:  It starts with whispers.<br />Then someone picks up a stone.<br />Finally, the fires begin.<br />When people turn on witches, the innocents suffer. . . .<br />Tiffany Aching has spent years studying with senior witches, and now she is on her own. As the witch of the Chalk, she performs the bits of witchcraft that aren t sparkly, aren t fun, don t involve any kind of wand, and that people seldom ever hear about: She does the unglamorous work of caring for the needy.<br />But someone or something is igniting fear, inculcating dark thoughts and angry murmurs against witches. Aided by her tiny blue allies, the Wee Free Men, Tiffany must find the source of this unrest and defeat the evil at its root before it takes her life. Because if Tiffany falls, the whole Chalk falls with her.<br /><br />The Tiffany Aching series is one of my favorite young adult series.  The fourth installment in the series I Shall Wear Midnight is an excellent read. It was like meeting up with a good friend you had not seen in some time. I find it very sad that this is the last in the series. Though Tiffany would be the first to admit that she's not perfect, she comes about as close as you can get. It's hard to believe that she is only 16 years old. She has wisdom beyond her years, which is why I suppose, she is a witch. Tiffany and the Mac Nac Feegles and Granny Weatherax and Nanny Ogg will be greatly missed.<br /><br />This story is somewhat darker than the other Tiffany books.  It explores the worst of human nature. The writing and imagery are very powerful and will have the reader examining their own actions and thoughts.<br /><br />I highly recommend this and the other Tiffany Aching books (you really should read them in order) for any young adult (or old adult) that enjoys fantasy and books that make them think.
B004BRP7R4|3.0|You can not doubt the vocal talent of Josh Groban.  For a baritone, the man has a huge vocal range and presents his voice in an amazing way.  That being said, \\"Illuminations\\" is not what I had hoped it would be.      Mr. Groban no doubt feels the words and music of every song he sings, but I cannot listen to this album and think anything other than I had listened to 12 iterations of the same song (I did like \\"Straight To You\\").  I am a karaoke junkie and usually have several songs I love to sing, but this album produced 1 song that I'm only slightly interest in (albeit the first song is an instrumental).     Every song is beautifully done, which I have come to expect from Josh's albums, but most aren't distinctive and don't rise to the level of songs from his other albums.  I'm still a big fan of his, but I'm hoping his next effort brings him true to form.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I absolutely love this work out dvd! If you are ready to get in shape this is a must have. This dvd changed my life, I used to never exercise and then 1 day I decided to change that and I purchased this dvd. This workout is no joke, but let me tell you, you will see results in no time. I completed the whole 30 days, & I lost 7 pounds and inches. It made me really want to continue exercising and have a better life style. Thank you Jillian for changing my life in so many ways.
0393338827|5.0|The above bowdlerized quote from an anonymous \\"former Senate investigator\\" was the lead line in Matt Taibbi's February 16 article in Rolling Stone.  It also perfectly encapsulates Michael Lewis's excellent and very well-written summary of the subprime mortgage meltdown.<br /><br />Lewis had the unenviable task of explaining to the reader the Wall Street machinations, processes and financial derivatives, which were so complicated nobody really understood them -- not the math PhDs who created them, and certainly not the CEOs of the firms who promoted them.  Lewis is such a good writer that the reader feels (fleetingly, momentarily) that maybe, possibly, we actually *do* understand them.<br /><br />By focusing on some of the smaller players in the market and telling the story from their viewpoint, he manages to humanize a story which is at its heart very corporate and institutional.  He explains how there is no single \\"bad guy,\\", no \\"patient zero.\\"  He explains how not just a single failure of oversight -- not even a massive abdication of duty by the SEC -- but an entire culture of deliberate fraud arising from the ashes of the 1980s S&L implosion, fueled the buildup to the largest financial disaster in this nation's history.  Larger in both raw numbers and in scope than 1929's collapse of market speculation -- made all the more galling because this one was deliberate.  And unchecked.<br /><br />Lewis chooses to highlight some of the players who bet against the market, who saw the unsustainability of what was going on and chose to \\"short\\" it, or bet against it.  When the market collapse came, as swiftly and decisively as everyone knew it inexorably would, they made their hundreds of millions of dollars in profit... but were left sitting astride the rubble of the collapsed economy.<br /><br />And \\"nobody went to jail.\\"<br /><br />Not only that, nobody on Wall Street even paid the price.<br /><br />Late in the book (pg. 256) Lewis writes, \\"The people on the short side of the subprime mortgage market had gambled with the odds in their favor.  The people on the other side -- the entire financial system, essentially -- had gambled with the odds against them.  Up to this point, the story of the big short could not be simpler.  What's strange and complicated about it, however, is that pretty much all the important people on both sides of the gamble left the table rich.\\"  Bonuses were paid with TARP funds, stimulus money paid off the outrageous 40:1 bets made by AIG (not even discounted!  100 cents on the dollar!) and the worst part is: nothing structurally changed.<br /><br />The Wall Street firms that brought down the world economy went right back to business-as-usual, paying themselves 9-figure bonuses and gambling with other people's (taxpayer's) money.  NOTHING HAS CHANGED.<br /><br />The Dow Jones is right back up in the same territory is was before the collapse, while the *real* economies of the world continue to struggle with liquidity, joblessness, lack of investment, and greatly diminished outlooks.  Governments are slashing spending in the face of crushing deficits.  Generations will suffer the effects of the greed and avarice of today's Wall Street tycoons.<br /><br />Everything really *is* [messed] up.with the odds in their favor.

0307405095|4.0|Martha Stewart has filled a book with luscious pictures of pies and tarts. There are classic pies, free-form, creamy and chiffon, rustic and layered, mini pies, and ones for the holidays and savory pies. There are pictures for each and a very few illustrations  for techniques such as  pressing in the dough. It would have been an added bonus if there would have been more of these, such as transferring the dough  into the pie plates.<br />There is a section at the end that purports to give you everything you need to know to make these pies and tarts. The one huge failing here is that piecrust edges are shown as finished products and almost no instruction on how to accomplish them. The instructions on lattice pies is very good.<br /><br />Ingredient staples are covered as well as equipment. There are techniques  for pate brisee, puff pastry , various crusts, creams and toppings.<br />The savory pie recipes are outstanding, as is the peach and berry tart and the maple nut tart, which can use various kinds of nuts.<br />It's a good book, but would really benefit from having some more of the techniques needed shown.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|A very high quality app, with a well-thought-out UI and great functionality. It's already helped me spot the reason for issues I'm having with WiFi interference at home and at the office. Why T-Mobile or someone doesn't license this to include with their phones is beyond me.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Just received this little flash today. Installed the batteries, attached to Nikon D7000, I took a picture in my bedroom, all windows covered by drapes, the picture came out was amazing! Great value flash in this price, also, it is very convenience to carry around for the size.
B002ZG9800|2.0|i'm a big jim carey fan, but he's been in a rough patch.  this movie can't figure out what kind of vibe it's in and doesn't tell a good story.  good have been more successful in better hands, but doesn't hit the right notes, the chemistry is never there, and it's lost between a comedy, a drama, a doc... who knows.  Explicit where it should be implied and subtle where it should be graphic... a miss.
B000002UKS|4.0|I love this album I love this album I love... The Colour and the Shape. This may be recorded by the former drummer for the band 'Nirvana', that being David Grohl, but even though you see him in the music videos and in magazines, essentially he is a faceless man, like the photos in the booklet suggest. He's not really a 'conspicuous' character like Cobain, he's just a professional guy who get's on with the job. Like the original Foo Fighters the band is named after, these guys surreptitiously go about their business (which, in their case happens to mean ROCKING OUT and writing great music all round).    And the point of that? Well, you just don't even think about Nirvana when you listen to the 'Foo Fighters'. You just focus and the music. And, that, my friend, is a glorious reward. While not as Ground-Breaking as those guys he used to drum for, virtually every song here is enjoyable, (ok, with the possible exception of the opening 'Doll', but it's brief and not that bad anyway.) They are mostly rockers, but they are generally very thoughtful and melodic. For diversity there's the gorgeous 'Walking after you' and a couple of 60's-ish songs 'Up in arms' and 'See You'.    But 'Alternative rock'? That's a way over-used term! It's an out-dated relic that means 'NOT Hair-metal'. Well there weren't any hair-metal bands in 1997! So call yourselves melodic hard pop-rock or some big name that sounds impressive. Or who cares, the music is impressive enough. Rating ****
B002ZG997C|4.0|This is a very good movie.  Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman are particularly good.  Denzel is riveting as always.  I'm not sure why this is not a blockbuster, but I have found that blockbusters are not always the best movies I guess.  This movie may be a little too \\"religious\\" for some, but I thought it was fabulous.
B004TB6GUY|5.0|Zakk Wylde has done it again, as always it is a great release from BLS. Full of heart and soul I would recommend this album to anyone who wants to have a good time while listening to some awesome tunes. I give it a full 5/5 for total awesomeness!!!
B0034G4OUO|5.0|If your doctor tells you NOT to elevate your heart rate, DO NOT WATCH this movie! It moves fast and will totally enthrall! Read the cover before watching to understand what's happening. Dwayne Johnson in one of his best roles! ACTION, ACTION, ACTION! Where's my pills?
B00007KQA3|5.0|This is the version with the complete Dominic Muldowney score rather than the theatrical release which saw most of it replaced by a score by the Eurhythmics after the first week at the Odeon Haymarket, London.  And what a difference it makes!  This transforms a good film into a great film.  Get this version if you can.
B004G6009U|5.0|Tangled is the first movie that I have seen twice in the movies in a long while. I saw it with my family and had no qualms when my kids wanted to see it again with their cousins. Sure, it's musical like a lot of the princess movies, but the songs only add to the movie. I can see how many of the scenes would look amazing in 3D, but for me, it is prohibitively expensive. I don't think the movie suffers from the lack of 3D. The story and the characters make it. Definitely a good buy. Blu-Ray quality is amazing, and the DVD is perfect for trips when you don't have a DVD player where you're staying.
B000020617|4.0|These guys are fighting foo, or, as the bands' name might suggest. But seeing this is one of the few good albums in 1999, well, around the time of this release anyway, they really were the poo fighters. That's a new persona for the band; 'we are the Poo Fighters. While every other band makes mediocre, underwhelming or just plain bad music, we keep going along steady!'    And around 1999 the FF made music that was effortlessly melodious, so much so you'd find yourself singing along to one of these ditties, while out shopping or paying bills, during the day to day of life.     And they sure proved, with the diverse array of styles here, that they weren't a bunch of numb-skulls who just blew up amps, not that we don't like numb-skulls who just blow up amps! (We Love 'em!) But The Foo were something more 'sophisticated', perhaps, without explicitly saying it, more 'significant'. Even if they're really just a bunch of numb-skulls who blow up amps.    Well, they can rock like the best (Stacked Actors, Gimme Stitches), write pop rock with wonderful melodies (Generator, MIA, Next Year) or throw up surprises (Ain't it the life).     But if you're writing a song about relaxation and sweet love, saying 'Hell Yeah' over and over doesn't always add to the mood, and it has a similar effect on a song that might be about the joys of 'intimacy' (Headwires). Otherwise, I'd see no reason for this albums getting 4 stars.    And count yourself lucky if you are in certain countries, you get 'Fraternity', a cutesy punk-pop song that makes you wonder why they robbed the poor USA of hearing it? Rating ***1/2
B002L2GK0O|3.0|It was hard to rate this book because there really are two reviews here.    The book itself is good. I would definitely recommend it especially for a beginning brewer.    The Kindle addition is TERRIBLE! It seemed as if it was scanned and not edited as there are many misspelled and wrong words. That is mildly annoying. The biggest problem is that this book uses many tables that are unreadable on the Kindle. These tables are important lists and references.    The bottom line is buy this in book form but stay clear of the Kindle format. Can I get my money back so I can buy the actual book?
B000BQV52A|5.0|Gulda is incredible playing Beethoven...thoroughly masculine playing with colorizing touches everywhere!  Way better than his earlier cycle.  This Eloquence set of the original Amadeo recordings (later bought by Decca) really has it all!  Splendid remastering (as if the late 60's recordings needed them!), the complete concertos with Horst Stein (which are my favorite), and a couple bonus solo sonatas from 1971.<br /><br />Gulda is the antithesis to the ponderous Kempff...so if you want your Beethoven fully wild and spontaneous, glorious and full of color, don't hesitate investing in this incredible cycle!  To put it into perspective Gulda is a cross between Schnabel and Yves Nat.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|This was a gift but all the other Harry Potters were great so I would imagne this one will be too.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|After watching it many times I can say that Van Helsing is, to say the least, a mixed bag. The overall plot was pretty good in my mind, though the execution was weak. The effects were strange in that sometimes I was laughing at the cheesiness, and other times I was awestruck. I particularly enjoyed the werewolves in this movie as they had, in my opinion, a perfect balance of man and wolf. In general, the movie did a wonderful job of paying homage to traditional monster movies.     The offbeat style was what threw many people off, since it didn't really stay in one particular genre. It had a little bit of everything; suspense, comedy, action, romance, you name it. Throw in elements of steampunk for additional confusion (or in my case, elation). Another thing was the lack of gore. Just because it is a monster movie does not mean you have to have guts spilling everywhere and blood running in the streets. Yes people died, yes people got eaten, but it was done in a classy way. It was spooky, but something you could still watch with the whole family.    As picky as I am when it comes to films, I do have days when I just want to sit down and enjoy some mindless entertainment. Van Helsing delivers with lots of action, decent effects, great music and an interesting cast. I liked it a lot, even if nobody else did.     Instead of going \\"there's no way that could happen,\\" remember that it's a silly monster movie. Just shut up and enjoy the ride.
B003UESJFG|4.0|While I don't think that any of the Dreamworks titles hold up to Pixar's efforts (except for How to Train Your Dragon), they continue to put out fun titles that parents and kids can enjoy. Megamind is no exception. It's a fun take on the superhero genre. The Blu-Ray quality is there, but it's also nice to have the DVD to take on trips. It would have been nice to have the digital copy as well, but I cannot complain with the value. Very happy with the purchase.
B001DHC7U0|5.0|Item came as described. Very happy with condition and happy the seller was not over charging people for an item even though it is SUPER RARE. I would reccomend this seller and product to anybody that is a huge Amon Amarth fan this is a GREAT box and Super Limited. If you get a chance to grab one do it!
B004TB6GUY|5.0|The Song Remains Not The Same is a departure from the face melting guitar riffs we have come to expect from Zakk Wylde and Black Label Society.  Nevertheless, this cd still rocks.  We get exposed to the depth of talent (piano, acoustic guitar, soulful vocals) that Zakk Wylde possesses.  A great cd and a must have for any fan of Zakk Wylde and Black Label Society.  Grab it now!
0061689246|5.0|I don't know why this is listed here under my name as it is not the illustrated edition of the novel. That edition goes by the name of 'Stardust, Being a Romance Within the Realms of Faerie' or 'Neil Gaiman and Charles Vess' Stardust' and has 175 illustrations. This edition is PROSE ONLY, lovely prose, of course, but no pictures. Hope this helps! Best, Charles Vess
0385341679|5.0|This was a great book.  I read it in like a day and a half.  I know the author said the series was over but she did leave it open to be able to write another book.  All questions do get answered.  I was totally surprised at the end.  This book is very well written and you can tell it was well thought out before it was written.  I am glad I spent the money and didn't wait for it to come out in paperback.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Thor took me by surprise and has now become one of my favorite Marvel Comic movies! There is never a dull moment, and is filled with action, comedy, suspense and Norse Mythology. The city of Asgard is beautiful. Chris Hemsworth was perfect for the role as Thor!<br /><br />Thor is about to become King of Asgard, until Frost Giants ruin the ceremony. When Thor travels to Jotunheim to confront the leader, Odin takes away Thor's powers and sends him to Earth, where he comes across a beautiful scientist named Jane Foster. 50 miles away from the town is Thor's mighty hammer, Mjolnir, which no one can pick up. Until Thor becomes worthy, he won't be able to pick up his hammer.<br /><br />Back on Asgard, Loki becomes the new King, and sends the Destroyer to Earth to kill Thor. Will Thor be able to save the town without his powers? If you want an awesomely epic superhero movie, you'll love THOR!!!
0756404738|4.0|To take a page from Rothfuss himself, \\"I loved this book. What else is there to say?\\" Rothfuss writing here is just as superb as in the book's predecessor; beautiful and splendid imagery.   Unfortunately I could not give the book five-stars as I feel that the pacing was off. Too much time is spent on \\"side-quests,\\" resulting in very little progress of the actual main plot (the hunt for the Chandrian). Rothfuss will have to cover much ground in the third book, as there was little substance to the plot in this one. I do wonder how Kvothe will finish the story of his life in just three days if he takes a whole day to talk about one year.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|So basically I bought these at the end of August, and received them by September. Set up was very easy and quick. The first month brought great fun, having a headset of this magnitude was great. I could hear everything loud and clear, the microphone was excellent and transmitted clear chat. I was primarily using these for the PS3, but also used them somewhat with my mac. Overall they received light use the first month. In November the headset started to short out in the right ear, but some jiggling of the USB cleared it up. By the end of December the right ear was totally dead, no sound came through at all, after trying it on multiple devices and using it with different setting. In addition to this the boom mic began to droop and would not stay in place.<br /><br />I play games pretty casually, and had traveled with the headset once, during which it was stored in a padded case. I never mishandled or tampered with the product, I kept it dust free, untangled, and in a safe place since I purchased it. In march the microphone died out, and at the beginning of last month, the left ear phone plays sound very, very low and very distorted. After this experience I can't say that I'll purchase a product from Turtle Beach again, even though they are going to repair the issues for me. For the amount of cash you pay for these things, I would expect a little more then a month's worth of problem-free use, and a lot longer life span.<br /><br />These more or less preformed on-par with a 15 dollar set of Nike headphones I purchased around the same time that I used for my iPod which goes everywhere with me, and received wear and tear from daily use. Very disappointing.
B002NUULNG|5.0|Ghost in the Shell 2.0 was surprisingly watchable--perhaps my prejudice towards altered films is too extreme.  Although I agree with my fellow Ghost in the Shell fans that the changes present in 2.0 are (frankly) unwelcome and unnecessary, the film itself is still wonderfully entertaining and thought-provoking.    I doubt a proper re-master of the original film will ever be released, so the included (slightly ugly) original film (in the special features section) will have to do.       The new audio sounds great, and the awkward looking CG version of Major Kusanagi doesn't overstay her welcome.  Overall, the changes are a small price to pay in order to add my favorite anime film to my blu-ray collection.
076115728X|5.0|Everyone, children and adults, should learn to relax a little and turn mistakes into happy accidents.  I bought this for my baby, but will share with my classes!
B004X8W4A4|5.0|I have read both of the books in print based off the show, CASTLE.  This is by far a better book and was hard to put down!  I love the TV show and it is great to see that some things from what they talked about ended up in the book.  If you are a true fan, this book is an absolute must!!
0881425591|5.0|I finally found this tape set after looking for a long time. I used to listen enchanted for hours to the version from my primary school library.    It's not just a narration as it has many different voices, all very well played, and musical interludes. Big wig's characterisation and voice is perfect. It would be great to see this on CD/MP3 sometime.
B004KPLVW2|4.0|I saw Tron, now a classic, when it was first shown in the theater. It was quite spectacular with the special effects at the time. It was way ahead of its time as the computer industry was not what it is today. A marvelous piece of film. A must watch before seeing the sequel - Tron - The Legacy.
0307472841|2.0|I'd heard a lot about Mankell and was pretty excited to read this one. It started off pretty well with an interesting mass murder mystery.... And the historical fiction aspect of it was pretty cool.... But pretty soon, the mystery, for the reader at least, is solved. Narrative tension is lost. We know who did it. Then we've got to sledge through page after page of the main character figuring it out for herself..... Then he throws in a weird geopolitical bent to it that just doesn't flow with the rest of the story and I plum gave up. I've got like 100 pages left to read and I just don't care what happens.     I'm willing to give Mankell another try, because his other mysteries are supposed to be good... but I'm wary.
0307394549|5.0|I bought this at a bookfair, mostly to support the school.  I pulled it out one night to see if there was a new recipe I could try with ingredients in my pantry.  The Chocolate Sugar cookies were just the answer - and quite delicious!  I wanted to try some new cookies, my go-to cookies are chocolate chip or biscotti.  (Both varieties are found in Martha's book.)  I made the Earl Grey Tea Cookies for dinner with a guest and the light tea & orange taste was really unique.  I flipped through the book yesterday and found a chocolate pretzel recipe that turned out FABULOUS!  Of course, I was lucky to have espresso in the pantry.  Sometimes there is an ingredient listed that is not a typical staple - mereuinge powder for royal icing is not something I usually have on hand.  But so far I've really liked this cookie cook-book!  There is a chapter that includes utensils to have on hand, which helps.  I like the way the cookies are divided into categories - rich & dense, light & crispy, chewy etc.  There are some bar cookies - lemon bars, brownies etc.    Cookies is an excellent addition to my cookbook collection!
1401310400|5.0|I found this book to be an extension of enjoying the show.  You get to know the characters Richard Castle has created and the humor that the supporting characters bring to the story.  If you are a big fan - this is the book for you!  I warn you, it is hard to put down.
B0009P42S2|5.0|Steamboy is quite the film. Many years ago I saw this film on Toonami (a t.v. network show on cartoon network) which showed many various english dubbed anime's from their original format. I was pleased to find that the film was available as a directors cut and found that after purchasing this item that it was well worth the money. It is a classic anime that I now own for my own personal entertainment when I feel the need for a good film to watch.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|I was very satisfied and impressed on how fast I received my movie. The first movie I received skipped a little. I contacted the seller and he sent me a new one right away and it's perfect. 5 stars all the way!
0312370849|5.0|I promise you that you will always remember Sarah and her key. I could not put it down.  I fell in love with Sarah and admired her courage to survive such a terrible ordeal and go on to try and save her brother.  I admired Julia for digging deaper to find answers and admit to her ignorance. Yes, it can be a dark, haunting story, but anything to do with the Holocaust is. Read it, this is one of those far and few between books that stays with you forever!
B003JTHESA|3.0|This was a rather quiet release by Iron Maiden, however the album is produced and arranged in typical Maiden fashion.  It is an album that after the first listen, you will want to compare it to their previous efforts, but just know that this is probably a mix of their last two albums, therefore don't expect any worldly surprise.  It's a slower, more drawn out Maiden, the type that was heard on AMOLAD.  This may have been what what was left over from that album, who knows.<br /><br />The album does grow on you, but in retrospect, this album is decent for what it's worth, and will be a welcome addition to the avid Iron Maiden fan.  It's definitely a weaker effort to me than their previous two, but it has its moments which will no doubt entice and entertain the heart of the Maiden fanbase out there.  Beautiful album artwork as usual.  Let's hope this isn't their last effort.
B0016BWACI|5.0|All I remembered from the DVD, plus much more (new documentaries are good; game not so exciting) in pristine HD!<br />Interesting to hear the other European languages. Would have loved to hear Japanese. Or at least a few more subtitles.<br /><br />Buy it! And prepare for the sequel!<br /><br />Jim Henson, a true visionary!<br /><br />This is essentially muppets, but NOT muppets! Incredible.
B004478GN8|5.0|my brother ordered this since he oves Lego Star Wars and it is an awesome set to add to his collection!
0670022411|1.0|What a huge dissapointment this book was. The author seemed to be confused between a Angels and Demons type of drama then a Twilight kind of vampire romance.   Lost interest, really tried but could not make myself finish it.  Too many other good books out there and not enough time to read them!
B004LAIU4I|4.0|Paul Simon's latest effort [[ASIN:B004LAIU4I So Beautiful or So What]] turns out to be a home run for the veteran folk-rock singer.  Filled with a plethora of sounds and great vocals from the aging rocker, Simon proves that `age ain't nothin' but a number' on this valedictory addition to his discography.  Rivaling the quality of 1986's album of the year winning [[ASIN:B00000E9O7 Graceland]], So Beautiful or So What is jam-packed to say the least.<br /><br />The effort opens with the excellent \\"Getting Ready for Christmas Day,\\" which cleverly uses spoken word elements from a pastor in the background.  Simon sounds great, and the guitars are well produced given a `choppy,' rhythmic sound.  What may be most notable is the updated folk sound that Simon incorporates, not to mention his knack for lyricism.  \\"The Afterlife\\" continues to the upswing of quality featuring a grand groove and a simple, yet succinct refrain: \\"you gotta fill out a form first, and then you wait in the line...\\" \\"Dazzling Blue\\" doesn't miss a beat, finding Simon dabbling in ethnic percussion and overt African influence reminiscent of Graceland.  \\"Maybe love's an accident or destiny is true, but you and I were born beneath a star of dazzling blue, dazzling blue,\\" Simon sings so convincingly on the `dazzling' chorus.<br /><br />\\"Rewrite\\" plays smartly into a minimalist vibe, finding Simon sitting mostly on two chords throughout. Again, Simon embarks upon ethnic sounds coupled with his own indigenous folk-rock leanings. \\"Love and Hard Times\\" exhibits more sound songwriting as always (\\"God and his only  son, paid a courtesy call on Earth one Sunday morning, orange blossoms opened their fragrant lips\\" being one of the stand out lyrics) and superb musical effects.  The track exhibits the typical complexity that pervades so many Simon songs - unpredictable harmonic progression and difficult to perform by others.  Hey, that makes Paul Simon the `one and only' Paul Simon!<br /><br />\\"Love is Eternal Sacred Light\\" features a nice pounding beat, which contrasts the slow, ponderous nature of \\"Love and Hard Times.\\" Vocal production is once again a highlight of this album, particularly on this cut.  \\"Amulet\\" is an instrumental piece which proves complex, despite its simplicity and brevity.  \\"Questions for the Angels\\" opens with just acoustic guitar and Simon's singing; it is a mysterious cut.  The thought-provoking nature helps to craft the effectiveness and uniqueness of this particularly song.  The coolest reference? \\"Downtown Brooklyn, the pilgrim is passing a billboard, and catches his eyes, It's Jay-Z, he's got a kid on each knee, he is wearing clothes that he wants us to try...\\"  \\"Love & Blessings\\" features a great instrumental mix and another award-worthy groove.  Closing cut \\"So Beautiful Or What\\" is a fine title cut, marked by a great groove that buttresses the cut.  Smartly, Simon makes the title cut more accessible than some of the more cerebral cuts.<br /><br />Simon proves that as he ages he has not lost his ability to compose great music.  His lyrics remain sharp while his musical restlessness is as fresh as anything else.  Vocally he still sounds great.

Smartly, Simon makes the title cut more accessible than some of the more cerebral cuts.      Simon proves that as he ages he has not lost his ability to compose great music.  His lyrics remain sharp while his musical restlessness is as fresh as anything else.  Vocally he still sounds great.  [[ASIN:B004LAIU4I So Beautiful or So What]] is another fine effort.
0385504225|4.0|Among the main characters, the lone Asian person, Director Inoue Sato of the CIA is portrayed as a smart, efficient, tough but an unattractive woman. She's described as being short and small, chain-smoking that manifests into her yellow teeth and foul breath, unsociable, unsympathetic, heavy handed and threatening  when dealing with subordinates and the public using bad language (swearing)...etc...    In one swoop, Dan Brown provides a stereotypical image of a repulsive female and Asian in a position of authority, even if she's a good guy. The only other repulsive main character in the novel is the villain himself, the demonic Mal'akh.    But Mr. Brown  can certainly  redeem himself to his Asian and/or  female audience by rewriting the character of Inoue Sato for the movie. She can be tough and no-nonsense but she  doesn't have to be physically unattractive or having bad manners. A senior CIA official will not swear in front of the public while chain smoking, even if that official were a male.    Casting someone like Michelle Yeoh in the role would be a good move. As demonstrated by her performance in Couching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Ms. Yeoh can be tough and feminine at the same time. And she's not a midget either!
B000SQJ2SC|4.0|Alright so we get it, he's an awesome producer, and somewhat of a musical genius among sellout pop artists.  But, Kanye's definitely not a great rapper, and if you think that you clearly haven't listened to anything besides Britney Spears and Lil John.    Anyways, I like the album, it's solid, great beats, each track is well organized and catchy.  But I wouldn't say it's a modern masterpiece, just a really great pop-rap album.  For the record, I'm a big Kanye fan, but I like his beats, not his rhymes, there's an enormous difference in the quality of the two.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|10 minutes into this movie & I was hooked! Amazing special effects & Avatar is a perfect almost 3 hours of complete escape from reality. Plot line is a bit predictable & some of characters are stereotypes, but just sit back & enjoy!
B004XDYJRU|4.0|I really enjoy TuneIn Radio Pro; it seems to buffer and keep a connection better than any other streaming audio program out there for Android.  I do wish that I could specify that the alarm clock should play out of the connected multimedia dock for my Atrix though; I have speakers hooked up to it that sound much better than the internal Atrix speaker.  I'd give it 5 stars if I could do that.
B004EC5IV6|5.0|2.22 is an excellent movie! Whether  you are a fan of Neon Genesis Evangelion, or new to the story everybody will find something. Small changes to the story, but is more linear and easy to peice together. Overall amazing movie! Can't wait for the last two Rebuild movies!
1609419693|5.0|I am a little surprised that people expected this to be different.  It is a memoir written by a comedian; odds are, it will be mostly tongue-in-cheek.  It is an easy read and may not give a lot of insight into Tina Fey's  life, but it does give a little insight into her humor and I guess that was what I wanted anyway.  It is definitely not your typical memoir and I would agree that her ideas and stories from chapter to chapter aren't always cohesive, but the humor more than makes up for that in my opinion.  Overall, a very fun read.
B004IWR06S|4.0|Hereafter<br />Directed by Clint Eastwood<br />Starring Matt Damon, C&eacute;cile De France, Bryce Dallas Howard and Jay Mohr<br /><br />Warner Bros.   2010   129 min   Rated PG-13   Released Mar 15, 2011<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />French: Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />Discs:<br />50GB Blu-ray Disc<br />Digital copy<br />DVD copy<br /><br />I'm a fan of Clint Eastwood, whether he's acting or directing. Hereafter almost tempted me to see it in the theater, but generally negative reviews made me wait for the Blu-ray release. After finally seeing it, I think I know what caused the negativity. That said, it worked on a number of levels for me and met the expectations I had when it was originally announced.<br /><br />So why do some people dislike it?<br /><br />The first reason is the trailer. The use of the tsunami scene and the train accident suggest that the movie will contain plenty of action. It also hints at a fantasy aspect and that viewers will see the afterlife depicted. In reality, these incidents merely set the scene for what the characters are dealing with.<br /><br />Another potential problem is the story structure. Similar to movies such as Babel and Magnolia, Peter Morgan's screenplay introduces strands of a plot which eventually meet. One of these threads frequently uses subtitles as the people involved are French. The pacing is fairly slow and we are allowed to see things gradually develop.<br /><br />The final reason is the resolution of the individual stories. Eastwood allows room for us to speculate what will happen to the characters as they move on with their lives. It's not a traditional Hollywood ending where every loose end is neatly tied up.<br /><br />There are three main stories:<br /><br />Marie (De France), a French news anchor, has a near-death experience in the first six minutes of the movie, but ultimately survives a tsunami. It changes the way she thinks about her life and she can't focus on her job and normal activities. She wants to write a book about the experience.<br /><br />George (Damon), who lives in San Francisco, has psychic ability and used to perform readings. He wants to forget that part of his life and have a normal job. Unfortunately, that's not easy to accomplish. His ability hinders his chances at normal relationships and his brother, Billy (Mohr), encourages him to reconsider his decision to stop giving readings.<br /><br />Marcus and Jason are identical twins who live with their alcoholic mother in London. When Jason is killed after being struck by a car, Marcus has to deal with the loss. His world is crumbling around him and he looks to various psychics to help, but all are shown to be fakes.<br /><br />As the story progresses, it switches more and more rapidly between the three threads. We suspect that the three main characters will eventually meet and interact, but it's not clear how and to what degree. I won't ruin that for you.<br /><br />Death is a complex and thought-provoking subject. What happens when we die? Is there something more? What would you say if you could talk to loved ones you have lost? How much stronger might the feeling of loss be for someone losing an identical twin?<br /><br />Eastwood makes some good choices in this movie. After the opening tsunami sequence, the story is the focus rather than special effects. The casting worked well and the main actors did a terrific job. Damon seemed completely natural in his role and De France also gave a strong performance.<br /><br />Rather than trying to show viewers what the afterlife might look like, Eastwood shows us very little. It's left to our imagination. All that is made clear is that George is having psychic visions and those are handled in brief flashes similar to Christopher Walken's character in The Dead Zone. The story explains what happens to the three characters at a point in their lives and nothing more. Again, the right choice. Any resolution to the three story threads would have felt tacked on and superfluous.<br /><br />Video Quality 4.5/5<br />While the tsunami sequence doesn't look totally convincing - despite the film receiving an Oscar nomination for visual effects - it isn't a fault in the transfer. Some of the cinematography is beautiful and colors appear bright and natural. Detail is strong and this is one of Warner's stronger transfers.<br /><br />Audio Quality 4.5/5<br />The lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix doesn't disappoint either. It's at its loudest during the opening tsunami, but background effects all come through clearly and dialogue is perfect. I had to turn the volume up a few decibels more than for most films, but the presentation is even throughout once the appropriate level is selected.<br /><br />Special Features 4/5<br /><br />Step Into the Hereafter: Focus Points (42 minutes, 1080p) - Eastwood and Damon go into more depth about some of the choices made for the film.<br /><br />The Eastwood Factor - Extended Version (128 minutes, 1080p) - A look at Eastwood's career, available in HD for the first time.<br /><br />I completely understand why some reviews were negative. If you're the type of person who enjoys art house films and contemplating your existence, there's a chance you will get something from Hereafter. If you have a problem with slow-pacing, subtitles and unresolved plot threads, pass on this title.<br /><br />It was a pleasant surprise for me and something that I will definitely revisit before too long.<br /><br />Overall score 4.5/5erfluous.

B004DK5CW4|5.0|This is a great story and a beautiful film. Even though you know how it turns out you still have all the excitment and thrill as if you didn't know. I've watched it like 5 times already.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|I get bored with games quickly, and this is really no exception.  BUT, it was offered free for a day through Amazon's App Market, so I picked it up and it was fun for a while, and for free, that's not bad.
B00383UJ2U|4.0|I was very pleased with my purchase of the CD Happiness.  The only thing was that the CD case received a big crack in it from the mail.  I would suggest using a little more substantial packing.  But otherwise the CD itself was in perfect shape.
B000001EYO|3.0|If you liked the movie, I'm sure you'll like this soundtrack CD. If you haven't seen the movie, then it will seem like a bit of an odd mix of music. But then why would you be buying this if you haven't seen the movie? And therein lies the problem - You want this CD to remind you of the movie, but it's only got about half the songs. Plus it's missing some of the most significant songs (Tumbling Tumbleweeds, the 2 CCR songs and Viva Las Vegas). So as much as I like the movie and as much as I like this CD because of the movie, it still only gets 3 stars because it's not complete. If you want the complete movie soundtrack then you need to also obtain:<br /><br />Peaceful Easy Feeling, Eagles<br />Piacere Sequence, Teo Usuelli<br />Requiem In D Minor, Mozart (Slovak Philharmonic)<br />Pictures At An Exhibition, Modest Mussorgsky (Concertgebouw Orchestra)<br />Run Through The Jungle, Creedance Clearwater Revival<br />Tammy, Debbie Reynolds<br />Standing On The Corner, Dean Martin<br />Tumbling Tumbleweeds, Roy Rogers and the Sons Of The Pioneers<br />Viva Las Vegas, Shawn Colvin<br />Viva Las Vegas, ZZ Top<br />Behave Yourself, Booker T and the MGS<br />I Hate You, Monks<br />Looking Out My Back Door, Creedance Clearwater Revival<br />Mucha Muchacha, Esquivel<br />Oye Como Ya, Santana<br />We Venerate Thy Cross, Rustavi Choir<br />Branded Theme tune<br /><br />Note that the movie credits state 'Big Johnson' performs Viva Las Vegas. Clearly that's a joke (with reference to the movie). It's actually ZZ Top. And I wouldn't bother with the Branded Theme tune (especially as it's the Dude who sings a bit of it whilst drunk in the Malibu cop car). But the others are all pretty good and will give you a much more complete & memorable movie soundtrack.<br /><br />Update on 20-Mar-2013<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />I believe jrai is correct - The version of Viva Las Vegas jokingly attributed to 'Big Johnson' (which you hear in the movie playing in Bunny's crashed Jaguar) is NOT the ZZ Top version. I've no idea who it is. I can't confirm if it's T Bone Burnett. The ZZ Top version is pretty close though and a good addition to this collection.

B0006ZE7G2|5.0|I have this copy on the very first release on DVD. It is by far one of my top movies in my 2400 title colletion. The thought of having high deffinition video as well as improved sound quality just makes me wonder why this has not yet been released to Blu-Ray. With seeing movies like Shaktopus on Blu-Ray makes me cringe and my mind spin as to why a classic movie like this has not been adaptoed is beyond me. I my be a little bias in that I am a Pink Floyd fan but the numbers don't lie. In the user reviews this movie gets almost a perfict 5 star rating. With that kind of following it still boggles my mind that they have not transfered it to Blu-Ray so the the full sound and audio experiance can be savored.
B004SC8YH2|3.0|I haven't listened to the album yet, but only to the music sampler. Based on what I heard, every song is almost a carbon copy of the other. One of the most enjoyable aspects of his earlier music, was his ability to mix up the songs. Throwing in a little edge to some of them and varying the lyrical content made him a smash hit. That is what I long for. The sampler on this album just doesn't convince me that I should buy it.
B003L77GRO|4.0|This would be a 5 star season if it weren't for some bizarre stories and plot holes within the main storyline. I love Dexter, but I felt like there was some sloppiness and too many loose ends in the handling of Season 5. It's a season with an excellent premise, but mildly disappointing execution.<br /><br />**Possible Spoilers Below**<br /><br />A new partnership forms between Dexter and Lumen Pierce, a victim of Dexter's latest target. Lumen, who's played by Julia Stiles, is easily the dark horse of the season as far as I'm concerned. Her character is semi-unoriginal (Season 3's Miguel Prado shared a similar role), but she brings a freshness and emotional element to the show that Dexter Morgan lacks and Rita left behind. I thought the story of Lumen courting Dex to help track down the men who'd abused her and held her captive was magnificent. The chemistry between the two characters was far beyond anything I could have hoped for considering how invested I'd become in the Dexter/Rita dynamic. Additionally, there was something about this particular vigilante quest that feels different from any of Dexter's previous work, possibly because for the first time vengeance is being delivered by the victim. Either way, I was really drawn into Lumen and Dexter's story; it was dramatic, entertaining and charming all at the same time.<br /><br />Unfortunately from there, the season becomes a bit of a subtle mess. I have no problem looking past minor errors or drawing up my own conclusions as to why this or that could've fit the story, but a few of the subplots just didn't seem to come together in Season 5. The first thing I couldn't understand was why so little time was spent wrapping up Rita's story. After watching the Season 4 finale, my first thought was why the writers would kill off Trinity when they could've built the ultimate vengeance story revolving around the two serial killers in Season 5. I really thought Dexter hunting down Trinity to avenge Rita's death could've been the defining plot line in the series. Rather, the writers chose to focus on Rita for just one episode, only sporadically mentioning her from that point on. Astor's struggles in coping with her mother's death was just about the most invested the writers got in Rita from that point forward, and it felt unrealistic, even for the emotionally challenged Dexter, to write her off so quickly.<br /><br />The Santa Muerte killer story is nothing more than a stall, if you ask me. It's not bad at all, but essentially it has no tie-in whatsoever to the barrel girl murders. I'm not really sure what to make of it; you just figure each subplot is linked to the main story in some way, shape or form. Aside from a couple very minor connections, this really wasn't, and considering what a big part of the first seven or so episodes it was, I was surprised what an irrelevant, distant memory it became by season's end.<br /><br />Finally, Quinn's refusal to work with Agent Liddy after news of his suspicions reached Deb caused him to ignore very incriminating evidence against Dexter and Lumen. It was so blatant that when Dexter finds Liddy's pictures in Quinn's apartment, he mistakenly thinks Quinn is uncovering his secret life. The short of it is this: Quinn becomes so enamored with Deborah Morgan that he decides to drop his investigation of Dexter and ignore any and all dirt Liddy digs up in favor of preserving his relationship with Deb. Quinn was all over the place in Season 5, and I just found him to be completely out of character at times and his story impossible to believe.<br /><br />On the flip side, I found Lumen's reason for leaving Dexter a little easy, but definitely feasible. I'd like to see her return to the show at some point in the future if the writers find a good way to work her into a story.<br />Though their characters were a little more unlikeable than usual, Maria and Angel deliver a very dramatic and tense subplot with their personal lives and professional lives clashing out in the open. Agent Liddy quickly develops a \\"here comes trouble\\" reputation, certainly a welcome addition to the show despite his malicious intentions. Lastly, I thought Trinity was too likeable for an antagonist (doesn't help that I'm a big fan of John Lithgow), so I was thrilled at how easily I could dislike Jordan Chase. Not only is that attributed to excellent character development, but Jonny Lee Miller deserves a lot of credit for his portrayal of the motivational speaker leading a double life.<br /><br />Of course, some things never change. Michael C. Hall brings Dexter to life, continuing to make the serial killer one of the most compelling characters on television. Michael's performance coupled with that of Julia Stiles really gave the plot a head of steam in Season 5. I thought in spite of Lumen's sad departure, the season finale was well crafted and well executed. It not only leaves you with a feeling of closure, but also leaves you wondering whether or not the status quo has changed.<br /><br />** **<br /><br />It has its problems along the way, but ultimately Season 5 was as good of a television drama as you'll come across. I gave it 4 stars; it's probably a little bit less than that, but I like giving shows the benefit of the doubt for sustained excellence. Dexter is absolutely still one of the best shows on television, and with Season 6 in production, we have more to look forward to.<br /><br />Grade: B+a \\"here comes trouble\\" reputation, certainly a welcome addition to the show despite his malicious intentions.

0385528752|3.0|This book seemed very promising at the beginning, with detailed illustrations of the author's main points.  However, as the book went on, rather than expanding on those points and providing the tools to identify and use such points, all you get is more illustrations.  I stopped reading half way through.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Which is what I did. I love her \\"voice\\" and the speed with which she flows through her story. At once humble and funny and confident and shy, her world is at once glamorous and mundane, with no preachy morals at the end. And yet you get a sense that here's someone who has a lot of life lessons (and common sense) to share, and she'll do it while she has you giggling. I hope she keeps writing.
B0031SCV46|5.0|Initially I spent a lot of time debating between the Akai and the Axiom keyboard controllers. After visiting my local music shop and being able to touch the keys to see how they felt, I immediately ruled out the Akai. The keys on the Akai are very stiff, and spring back forcefully. Nothing like a real keyboard. The Axiom on the other hand had much better feeling keys. The reason I mention these two is to say that I like the feel of the keys on the Oxygen even better than the Axiom. I'm not a major piano player, but the keys on the Oxygen were softer and easier to use.<br /><br />My debate then came down to the Axiom versus the Oxygen. The Axiom looks great, has the pads built in and has aftertouch (press key for one sound, hold down harder for another sound). The question was really whether these two features were worth the extra ~$150+. Since I also picked up an LPD8 (great product also) with this keyboard the pads didn't matter. That leaves the only thing missing between the two is the aftertouch. While it would be nice, it's not worth $150+ to me.<br /><br />The build quality of this keyboard is excellent. The knobs are all smooth (not the click type) and the integration with Ableton Live was seamless and perfect. I haven't even begun to mess around with custom mapping and the like. For a midi controller it does everything I could want it to. I'm currently using this straight into USB (I didn't get the power supply, and it doesn't come with it) and haven't had any problems with that. It controls Kontakt, Omnisphere, Superior Drummer, BFD, etc perfectly.<br /><br />I also picked up the slightly more expensive sustain pedal and highly recommend it to go along with this controller.

B004NSULHM|1.0|To be fair, I haven't heard the bonus material. With that said, I was looking forward to this album and although life teaches us there will be disappointment, this is the first time I've encountered it when listening to this bands work and I've been there since the beginning. Thom's vocals while capable, do nothing to rescue his band mates from this chaotic mess. Take one part Thom vocal, Add a cup of sputtering computer/synthetic sound affects, a half cup of static and enjoy the blah. Rinse. Repeat. In short, download lotus flower and avoid the temptation to buy this album. It's chocked full of meh.
0307887960|2.0|This diet reminds me of the old fad diets in the 1980s. They might work if they don't kill you first. The idea of eating all that protein to the exclusion of almost everything else does not appeal. I had high hopes when I ordered the book (Amazon Vine provided me a copy of this book to review), but when it arrived it was nothing new. I am more convinced than ever that the only way to lose weight is maintain an exercise regimen and eat moderately. This book has very elaborate plans in it and I am sure if someone followed it to the letter they would lose weight.  I am just not sure about the wisdom of doing so.

1433502410|5.0|I'm thoroughly impressed with both the translation and the study helps throughout this quality Bible. The ESV shares a lot of the same translation philosophies with the NASB as it takes a more literal view of both the Greek and the Hebrew. The study helps are incredible, containing a wealth of information, cross references, diagrams, timelines, and more. Indices include excellent histories, an overview of biblical ethics and doctrine, an excellent explanation of interpretative philosophies, exegesis, and hermeneutics; plus an excellent concordance, reading plans, full-color maps, and more.
B001C4CI8A|4.0|Please describe the audio/video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.<br /><br />The quality of this Blu-Ray is excellent, both with the audio and the video. The video was 10/10; great.  All Blu-Rays should be this good.<br /><br />After loading, the movie began - in Dolby Digital 5.1.  I had to go through the menus to change it to Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  There's probably not much difference - I just think it should have played originally in TrueHD, since I have the player connected to my receiver with HDMI.<br /><br />I played this on a Sony BDP-S360, and didn't have any problems.  Then I took it to the bedroom to see if it would play on my older player, a Sony BDP-S350, and it played without any problems.  I don't know what problem the other reviewer had with his BDP-S350.  I have never updated the firmware on either player.<br /><br />The movie is 128 minutes long, and was pretty good, just a little hard to follow (but maybe I was just tired).

B004I2K4E8|3.0|I had seen the 10th anniversary version of Les Miserables and really enjoyed that, but I bought this version because it was on Blue Ray and was in Surround Sound. So I thought it would be about the same, but with much better audio and video. I was so disappointed! This production is not very dynamic at all. The singers just stand planted to the stage and sing. There is very little in the way of choreography or movement. To me, it was BORING! And the performances were not as memorable as the 10th Anniversary edition. Sure, the video and audio quality are technically much better in this newer version, but unless you're into the \\"minimalist\\" production style, I would recommend the older version because it was much more enjoyable to watch.
032147404X|2.0|After ordering a new Canon 60D and getting in to digital Photography I decided to start by ordering a book. I spent a lot of time behind a lens shooting film, well back in the 80's, so photography isn't new to me but digital is, let just say I'm a novice.     Scott's book starts out with some real corny \\"I'm better than you\\" humor, I can look past this as I am really just trying to get some updated information here, and kindle the inspiration to go out and start shooting again. The book is full of some good information but just doesn't seem to go all the way through. It did bring a lot of long stored knowledge back to me and covered some basic stuff, but like I said it just sort of hits the wave tops of wide Varity of subjects.     I think that if I was bran new to digital photography and just got a bran new camera this book would frustrate me and end up in the bottom of the bag as I was going down to the local community college to enroll in beginners photography class. As for me this book is on the shelf, maybe I will open it again when I need inspiration to go and further the skill or art in lesser known discipline of photography.    If you new to Photography or just get a new digital camera check out Nicole S. Young's books by Peach pit Press
1595826971|5.0|I've been a fan of Alice since the original game on the computer and I can't wait for the 2nd game to come out! Anyways the book came in a box. After I opened it,  I was already staring at the front cover. I love the cover alot, it shows you exactly what your getting your self into before you open the book. The book is hard covered and the pages are thick and have some nice weight to them. This is one of the better art book for video games I've had. Most of the other ones are paper back.<br /><br />For what it costs right now ($20) this book is definitely a must buy. If you are a fan of Alice from the original game on the PC you should get this one. Theres tons of content to read about the processes and somethings about the upcoming sequel.  The art itself is very beautiful, its dark and yet there is so much detail put into every page. There's comments and such on each page, its very nice to read what the artists take on things were. My favorite section was Alice and her Dresses, which shows you sketches and reasons behind the designs and such.<br /><br />If your a fan of Alice you should get this book, the price is nice. If you like the original fairy tales that were more dark and morbid, than you would probably like this book. You won't be disappointed, it also makes for a good gift for those who like more dark and twisted things.
B003B02OOG|5.0|John Grisham has yet again out did himself. Ford County Stories represents all the genius and writing talent that defines Grisham, but in seven short stories rather than the usual novel format. Each story is well written, excellently detailed, and cleverly planned. Ford County Stories is a must-read.
1591843790|5.0|Just finished this enchanting book.  As an entrepreneur I've read many business and marketing books, in this book Guy Kawasaki does a great job of explaining the details involved in marketing strategies, these details help avoid unnecessary mistakes.  Essentially, Guy helps the reader think through new ideas and/or improve on old ideas, bringing them into the Internet age.<br /><br />One great piece of advice in the book that represents the book well, I think, is this thought, found on page 145.  Provide intrinsic value:  Inspiration, entertainment, enlightenment, education - used over time 'enchants' people.  Keep it short.  Keep all communications as short as possible - from emails to conversations.  The recommended length for an enchanting YouTube videos is 60 seconds.
B0043ZDU1E|3.0|This is a CD of very traditional Irish folk songs, which I was looking forward to hearing McKennitt's usual soul-stirring treatment of.  Unfortunately, that's not what this CD delivers.  The treatments and arrangements on this disc aren't BAD, don't get me wrong -- but if you were expecting and hoping for the stirring music of [[ASIN:B000J233U8 The Visit]] or [[ASIN:B000J233SK Book of Secrets]], I'm sorry, you won't find it here.  This is a slow, sparse, almost entirely acoustic CD that Loreena brought very little of her usual energy to and somehow managed to make every track downbeat.  There's nothing necessarily wrong with that, if slow, quiet, melancholy background music is what you're looking for; just ... be aware before you buy, that that's what it is.
B000GLKLCK|5.0|It is so very wonderful to have all of Mozart's sublime Piano concertos for piano and orchestra in one collection on twelve (12) CDs especially as fabulously played by Murray Perahia who also directs the great English Chamber Orchestra.  It has been so very lovely for me to hear these delightful concertos again on these recordings that originally were recorded from the late 1970s through the early 1990s and remastered by Sony fabulously.   The sound is great.   Bravo Murray!!
B00127RAJY|1.0|Ok, I have read the reviews - I can't understand the raves on this DVD.  First of all let me say that I am not a beginner exerciser.  I workout 7 days a week but I don't believe in torturing myself as this video will do to you.  I have only done level 1 because I am literally throwing this DVD in the trash so I don't try it again.  I can do level 1 without problems, it is challenging YES, but I can make it through.  It is the next day which is the problem.  I had to take 2 days off from exercising to let myself heal after this.  My right knee hurts, and my calves in particular are so tight and sore.  Her warm-up is just not up to par.  Even the moves in the warm-up are hard on the body.  Those knee stretches, no good!  She has you doing jumping jacks right out of the gate.  I would recommend for anyone doing this tape, which I don't recommend doing it, to walk on a treadmill or walk in place for at least 3 to 5 minutes because her warm-up does NOT prepare the body for the 20 minute non-stop routine she puts you through.  I think that is a big problem in the soreness the following day.  I don't even like her cool down.  You really don't need to kill yourself like this - I got myself down to a size 2 from a size 6 in doing boosted walking with Leslie Sansone and doing some kettle bell workouts and light resistance training and I don't hurt my knees in doing those exercises.  My knee hurt for quite awhile after this workout, those side lunges are awful - should be done with a professional overlooking you to see if you are doing them correctly because you can really hurt your knees doing them and the butt kicks, well totally unnecessary.  Any workout which makes you hurt the way this one does throws up a red flag! I would give this a zero star if I could.  I also don't like her attitude, I find her not motivating whatsoever.  No wonder this is marked down in price so much.

B000002MZ6|1.0|This is not a commentary on the music on this CD.  I haven't listened to my copy yet.  It's Mike Oldfield, what could go wrong?<br /><br />Well, with the \\"Enhanced\\" CD, plenty, it turns out.  If considering the \\"enhanced\\" CD, you need to be aware of two things.<br /><br />First, the CD-ROM data portion of this hybrid CD only works on Macs.  You can't play it on Windows or Linux.  What's more, it requires a PowerPC Mac running OS7 through OS9.  So you probably can't play it on your Mac either.<br /><br />Second, because the data track is the first track on the CD, the fact that it's unplayable except on a Power Mac will *also* prevent you from even listening to the CD on your PC, because neither Windows nor Linux can read the disc.  (You *may* be able to listen to it on OSX.)<br /><br />So:  Mike Oldfield!  Yay Mike Oldfield!  The tracks from this I already know are wonderful.  Mike Oldfield is a brilliant composer and musician.  But ... buy the non-\\"enhanced\\" version.  At best, you'll gain nothing unless you have a classic Mac, and you may be unable to listen to it altogether.
0307593495|5.0|THE TROUBLED MAN by Henning Mankell is the 10th and final book in the Kurt Wallander series. At 60, Wallander is no longer in command of his \\"troops\\"; he is diabetic, overweight, doesn't exercise, eats the wrong foods, sometimes drinks too much, experiences memory failures, and has trouble sleeping. He is always worried about something and takes the weight of the world, as he knows it, upon his shoulders. His daughter, also a member of the police, has found the love of her life and has just had a daughter. Wallander is thrilled to be a grandfather.    As he thinks about his coming retirement, he decides it's time to buy a house and get the dog he has yearned for over the years. Things seem to be on schedule until he is invited to the 75th birthday party given for Håkan von Enke, the father of his future son-in-law. The two men get along very well, and von Enke tells Wallander a story about a Russian submarine that was in Swedish waters in 1980. He was told to stand down by his superiors when he was about to fire a depth charge, and still doesn't understand the order to abort.    The next thing Wallander knows, von Enke goes out for his morning walk and never returns. His wife, Louise, is prostrate with worry, and his son can't believe that he would just walk away. The man had been a submarine commander and was greatly respected by his colleagues. After retiring, he lived a nice life, had good friends, and while always on guard still seemed content.    Wallander cannot help but get involved in the investigation, even though it's not in his jurisdiction. The policeman in charge welcomes Wallander's help, and the two work well together. As the investigation unfolds, he has the chance to meet people who knew von Enke and gets a real sense of the man from his friends. He also learns about Cold War activities that even he finds confusing.    About a month passes without a sign or sound from von Enke. And then Louise disappears, too. Did this couple have some kind of plan, and is she meeting him somewhere? No! She's dead. She's found fully clothed with her shoes neatly placed next to her body. Is this a suicide? Or murder? Can von Enke be dead too?    The troubled man of the title may be Kurt Wallander...or could it be von Enke? Or both? Two aging men are facing their futures in different ways but with heavy hearts. Wallander ruminates and broods throughout the novel. Mankell is wonderful at leading readers through the labyrinthine thoughts that go through Wallander's mind --- how he evaluates himself as a man, a father, a policeman and a failed husband. The writing is spot-on with not a single word out of place or frivolously inserted. THE TROUBLED MAN may be Mankell's finest novel. Readers can only hold their collective breath awaiting his next book. What he has planned is a true mystery.        --- Reviewed by Barbara Lipkien Gershenbaum
B000FCKGPC|4.0|While this is not as strong a book as Storm of Swords, it is really not so bad as people complain.  While my favorite plot lines, Danaerys and Tyrion, are missing, there is nothing extraneous in this book and you can clearly see where things are headed. I really enjoyed this book and felt it was ass well-written as its predecessors. I can understand people's frustration that it took 6 years for Dance w/ Dragons esp. given that this book ends so abruptly, but it is very worth reading and will make you anxious for DwD to be released.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|this is a top series, while i will admitt to being a syfy fanatic i only watched this series on an urging of a friend, so glad I took his advice, this is a fantastic series, while some of the special effects arn't quite quite there, look past them at the story, it's funny, sad and at times quite touching, all the charachters have a life of there own, not just some carboard actor rememmbering his lines, these guys pull you in.    Joss Whedon really came up with a great concept and by the final episode you really wanted more, but alas corporate heads axed the show as like many other great sci-fi shows in there begining, when they are just getting a strong fan base, dose stargate Atlantis or Caprica ring any bells.    so if you like syfy do yourself a favour and get this little gem in your collection, you won't be disapointed.

Sadly, SciFi Network decided to cancel this series at the end of season two to make way for more wrestling, ghost chases and cooking shows; is this HGTV or SciFi Network?  I won't be buying the dvd's simply because I no longer buy anything on dvd.

0307595862|4.0|At least according to author Jo Nesbo, Norway has had no experience with the modern day serial killer.  But since the star of his seven-book crime fiction series, Detective Harry Hole, is a U.S. trained expert on serial killers, when one does turn up in The Snowman, the ensuing investigation is in good hands.  The Snowman is the Norwegian author's U.S. debut, and its release in this country seems well timed to take advantage of the current huge popularity of Nordic crime fiction here.<br /><br />On the morning of the first snow of winter, a young boy awakes to find himself alone in the house.  His father is away on business, and the only sign of his mother is her favorite winter scarf - which someone has wrapped around the neck of the mysterious snowman that appeared in front of the house during the night.  Detective Harry Hole, lead investigator, has a feeling that this will be no ordinary missing person investigation.  Only weeks before, Harry received a strange letter, almost a challenge, that was signed \\"The Snowman.\\"  Now he wonders if the letter and this missing woman are connected.<br /><br />As Harry and his small investigative team search for clues into the young mother's disappearance, they uncover past cases in which the only witness seems to have been the large snowman left behind at the scene.  The oldest case goes back to 1980 but, up to now, no one has connected the cases via the icy calling card left behind by the killer in each instance.  Harry, though, is certain they are connected based on what they have in common: each victim was the mother of young children, each crime coincided with the first snow of winter, and a large snowman was present at each crime scene.<br /><br />As the bodies pile up, Harry begins to feel that it is all getting too personal, that the killer now known as The Snowman is playing with him and manipulating the investigation.  In what turns out to be a desperate race to save those closest to him, Harry is led around the country and taunted by the killer's false clues and finger-pointing right until the moment that it all finally makes sense to him- exactly as the Snowman planned it.<br /><br />The plot of The Snowman will prove to be more than a bit farfetched for some readers, but the book's well developed characters, even to the minor ones, make up for some of the stretch required by the plot.  Harry Hole, even as well developed a character as he is, is still predictable in the sense that he has so much in common with other popular fictional detectives from around the world.  Harry is an alcoholic detective struggling to stay sober (not entirely successfully), a loner both in his personal life and on the job, a roots music lover who makes frequent reference to the song he is listening to at the moment, a man who has perhaps let the love of his life slip through his fingers forever.  That description probably sounds familiar - but Nesbo pulls it off as well as anyone.  The Snowman is, in fact, as intricately plotted as any crime novel I have experienced in recent months.  I am, however, looking forward to the American release of earlier, and likely to be more realistic (that is, less spectacular), Harry Hole novels.<br /><br />Rated at: 3.5he killer's false clues and finger-pointing right until the moment that it all finally makes sense to him- exactly as the Snowman planned it.

B004Q1FDHO|5.0|Fun game to play. I can waste alot of time playing this game. only complaint is it occasionally freezes my droidx and the phone turns itself off and back on.
B004APVI1G|3.0|Frankly, I expected much more from this movie based on so many positive reviews. I think I am missing the good animated stories (which do not have to be on Blu-Ray or in 3D). The story is what counts by far the most. This story was so-so, not too original or inspiring. I also felt that many details that Blu-Ray affords caused some visual discomfort. The only thing I would applaud is the great landscapes... For the sake of justice, my daughter liked this movie (but did not watch it again).
B004QSQM72|5.0|I must say, my expectations for \\"Smother,\\" Wild Beasts' third album in merely three years, was pretty high. \\"Two Dancers\\" was such a triumph for the band. They had grown up so much since \\"Limbo, Panto,\\" which was such a testosterone filled wet dream (albeit a good one!). \\"Two Dancers\\" seamlessly infused the band's love of lyrically sexual themes and creative dreamscapes. I still regard their sophomore effort to be one of the best and most significant albums of the past ten years! It simply changed my musical life. However, nothing prepared me for another shot at greatness. 'Smother' rendered me, well, smothered in the best sense one can possibly mean. I'm confident in saying this is album of the year material. Sorry PJ Harvey, you'll have to make some room. '    \\"Smother\\" is aptly titled. There are so many layers of rich and complex elements to this album, it's quite a challenge for one not to be overwhelmed by its sheer beauty. Hayden Thorpe's wildly popular falsetto is balanced by Tom Fleming's deep sensual croon. Each has their chance to shine, and at times they are playing off one another to dazzling effect ('Reach A Bit Further').  \\"Lion's Share\\" is a fantastic opener. A deep pulsing synth radiates as Thorpe's vocals creep in as if he's singing directly into your ear. Lion's share is an idiomatic expression meaning the lion takes all. So in natural Wild Beasts fashion, Thorpe is conquering his love, \\"I take you in my mouth like a lion takes his game.\\"It's perhaps the band's first fully realized minimalist approach, and the results are striking. \\"Bed of Nails\\" is a dance song about doing anything for love like lying on a bed of nails. Masochistic, perhaps, but isn't everyone a masochist when they're in love<> There's also a sweet helping of literary references to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and Shakespeare's Hamlet. \\"Plaything\\" is deliciously dirty, sexy and sinister, quite often at the same time. \\"New squeeze, take off your chemise and I'll do as I please.\\" Asyou can probably guess, sex still dominates the Wild Beasts frontier. However, their approach is very straightforward without it being overbearing. It's tastefully done. Instead of a complete sexual throw down (\\"Limbo, Panto\\" style), they are taking their time, allowing themselves and you to enjoy the experience. \\"End Come Too Soon\\" may be the best example of this. At around the 5:30 minute mark, there is a climax of blissful piano and fuzzy electric guitar right before it takes off and then it's all over. Within that climax, though, Thorpe repeats, rather desperately and regretfully, \\"it's too soon. The end went and came too soon.\\" I thought it was too soon as well. Luckily I was more than ready to go back for seconds. If you were a fan of \\"Two Dancers,\\" \\"Smother\\" is a rather nice companion. If you're just curious, trust me, it's worth a blind buy.    OTHER HIGHLIGHTS (not mentioned above)  \\"Loop the Loop\\"  \\"Deeper\\"  \\"Invisible\\"

1401219268|4.0|I first heard about Watchmen when the movie came out several years ago.  Although, I never saw the movie, I thought it looked interesting so when I saw the book in a store recently, I bought it.  It was an interesting read and probably a book I'll reread in the future.<br /><br />Characters<br /><br />This is the most brilliant part of the book.  The characters are all masked heroes who were vigilante crime fighters earlier in their lives.  The book follows Rorschach, Nite Owl, the Silk Spectre, Dr. Manhattan, and Ozymandias.  The only character that could be said to have true superpowers in Dr. Manhattan, who lost his human form in a nuclear accident.  Most of the time when we see heroes from comic books, they are essentially paragons of virtue.  Batman and Superman may have their weaknesses, but they are still fairly black and white about their tasks.  The characters in this book aren't nearly as heavily in that vein.  Each of the characters is flawed in some way and the book shows this clearly.  The characters in this book are the single biggest reason to read this story.<br /><br />Setting<br /><br />The book is set in 1980's America, taking place in New York City.  The world history is heavily altered due to the existence of the heroes the story revolves around.  The biggest influence on the world is Dr. Manhattan and his knowledge of the workings of everything in the world.<br /><br />Plot<br /><br />The plot begins with Rorschach examining the death of another masked hero, the Comedian.  From this starting point, it begins to expand both forward and backward in time to show the characters pasts as well as the current events of the world.  The story is very didactic as it deals with the way that humans deal with conflict.<br /><br />Enjoyment<br /><br />The characters in this story are brilliant and are the main reason to read it.  All of the characters are beautifully flawed.  I generally don't care for stories that are clearly didactic to the point where itfeels like it's hitting you in the head.  The plot of this story reads that way to me at times, but the characters still make it worth reading.<br /><br />Overall Grade<br /><br />Worth reading, the first half of the book is where it really shines.<br /><br />7/10<br /><br />This and all of my reviews are available on my blog.  Check out my profile for the link to my blog.

B000AYEIZY|5.0|Even though this album was recorded so much later, it is retrospective in terms of the tracks, and thus remains the cream of blues-becoming-rock of the 60s. Listen to it after some serious exposure to Clapton on 'Five Live Yardbirds' and observe the progression. We don't always realise how much this minimalistic threesome shaped the future of rock music. There are two CDs and even though the second does not grab me as much as CD1, on the basis of the latter alone this has got to have a 5-star rating in my humble opinion. The sound and quality of the music seems also to me to have matured and become even more beautiful and downright yummy than it was back then. And once you've gotten into this, please listen to 'Blind Faith'.

Abasi wrote all the music and plays guitar like he's from another planet, a true artist. The songs are complex and heavy at times but also very melodic and beautiful. If you like incredible guitar playing, buy this CD.
B004SC8YH2|2.0|I am a huge Christopher Cross fan and was excited about a new release. I have everything he has put out in either CD, LP, cassette or a combo of such. I also have the DVD. He is always on my play list. When I heard it was a guitar based record I was hopeful for some variations in style and tempo. I downloaded it right when it came out and started listening. I was waiting for great things but I am very disappointed in this CD. He still sings great and has great musicians behind him but it all sounds like the same style and tempo throughout the record. I am not sure where the guitars are in these songs but I wouldn't call this a guitar record at all. Even Michael McDonald cannot help much here on the one song Doctor Faith - although it is probably the best song on the record. It sounds like Michael is on a loop and he throws in the same line from time to time. I was hoping this work would grow on me during the day but so far it hasn't. It pains me to write this but it is what it is. Hopefully if you are a big fan you may feel differently. I will go back to listening to the Cafe Sessions. That is a great performance.

B004SKLD9A|1.0|-----------2.0 STEREO ?!?!?!?!?!?--------------     Had to give 1 star even though I love this film.     From what I understand and if true can sum it up: Alliance (the totally crappy Canadian distributer) also owns Echo Bridge who is who bought the rights from Miramax.       Also as the other reviewer mentioned this release is in the wrong aspect ratio. The movie was filmed in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio. This Blu-Ray is in 1.78.1 aspect ratio.      It is possible both of these things are wrong (2.0 Stereo and Aspect Ratio) but that is how it is listed on the Blu-Ray case in front of me and I'm debating weather I should return it or not so I have not opened it yet.    I was so looking forward to this release......bummer.    Edit: 2.0 stereo and wrong aspect ratio confirmed see comment.
B004K4IZ3G|2.0|One would think that Disney would test their releases on at least ONE Samsung player.  While it's not uncommon for new blu-ray discs to be incompatible with existing blu-ray players, it's still disappointing to rip open the Amazon package, pop some popcorn, throw the disc into your player, and then spend the evening banging your head against the wall while trying to get the thing to play.    It's also disappointing to have to spend more than an hour on the phone with both Disney and Samsung support while they play the finger pointing game.  \\"It's Disney's fault,\\" \\"No, it's Samsung's fault,\\" depending on who you ask.    Apparently, ALL Disney blu-ray releases coming out since April, 2011 or so have this problem.  Each disc will freeze on the Disney magic castle loading screen and hang there indefinitely.  Samsung has promised a firmware update for their devices in order to enable playing of these new releases, but if you have a Samsung player, BE WARNED that it can take \\"up to six months\\" for a new firmware update, according to Samsung support.    Technical issues aside, I enjoyed this movie -- which is why it's so frustrating not to be able to watch it again!

B001UV4XHY|4.0|this was by far the darkest chapter in the harry potter series yet.it reminded me of \\"empire strikes back\\" or \\"revenge of the sith\\" in that it was a family film that took a very dark turn.                       the kids have to carry around a trinket for a while that makes them turn on eachother.it reminded me of \\"lord of the rings\\" and the hobbitts with the ring.                    it was not my favorite part.my favorite part was \\"prisoner of azkaban\\".although,i would rank it in the top half along with \\"the half blood prince\\"                    i say it is a good movie.the only harry potter movie to be my favorite for an entire year.yes the movie industry is going to crap but this was still the winner.                  now id like to address all the ill informed misfits out there about something.i hear a lot of people saying that harry potter is evil.they say just because the kids are at a school learning magic,that they must be satanic.well,magic is magic and satanism is satanism .they are 2 entirely different things.some of the wiccans and celts and such belive there isnt even a devil at all.others still belive that he is real but they belive he is pure evil and they sure as crap dont worship him.any idiot in the multiverse knows that.so i say to these uninformed misfits....GET A LIFE AND THEN AN EDUCATION.......ITS this same of short cuts to thinking that caused the inquisition.                 its just a bunch of family movies.nothing to run away from.kids playing with sticks and casting spells that make spiders walk on roller skates and stuff.

B001UV4XHY|5.0|Saw this Harry in the movies.  Was Great!!! Had to get this movie, because I own all the one's that are out now!  It's a little darker than the other Harry movie's, but still a Great movie.  Looking forward to the final one!!
B004RE29PO|5.0|i just finished watching aliens on blu ray.the quality of the picture and the sound is truly amazing.like watching a brand new movie even though it was made in the mid eighties.this is a clssic sci fi movie.watching it on blu ray makes it even better.highly recommended.5 stars.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|The Butcher of a galaxy far, far away strikes back as George Lucas continues to release version after version of the movies we loved as children and have grown to loathe as adults due to his constant (over)tinkering. Skip this noise and watch instead the South Park episode titled Free Hat where the show skewers Lucas for ruining the films and why it's NOT his right as an artist to make things up as he goes along.  \\"Free Hat, free Hat, free Hat!\\"
B002RKRTGO|1.0|okay people dont get this book! There is missing pages in it when ever some one reads a paper or document! save your money and get different one!
B00001OH7P|5.0|If you love David Bowie, this is a must have album. This is the essence of David Bowie. I listen to his newer albums, and I can't help compare them to Ziggy Stardust, and long for more of that!!! I first saw this album performed live, so it's not quite as amazing as that. But very close. I listen to this album nearly every day and it never gets old. You will not be disappointed with this album.
B004SC8YH2|5.0|Christopher Cross is a very talented singer-songwriter whose compositions were mainly keyboard based in the past. With this new CD release, Christopher Cross switches to guitar based compositions (his 'typical' sound is still recognizable but has more of the 'rock feel' than pop. His vocals are varied but as sharp as ever). This new CD (13 tracks) release is titled 'Doctor Faith' : a great release (a good mixture of ballad, up-tempo pop/rock & rock tunes) that should delite his fans (his popularity has dwindled since his great emergence in 1980s). The opening track \\"Hey Kid\\" is a solid track/gem/stand-out : great choice for the opening track with a beautiful guitar/keyboard combination and wonderful melody. Other solid tracks/gems/stand-outs include \\"November\\" (a ballad with a beautiful orchestral base track, great piano, vocals & melody) & \\"Prayin'\\" (wonderful guitar chords, melody, incredible violin, vocals & inspirational lyrics wishing intervention from the man above. A beautiful ending of this great CD) . Great tracks include \\"When You Come Home\\" (great violin/guitar combination), \\"Dreamers\\" (orchestral base track with a great rock sound), \\"Leave It To Me\\" (up-tempo track, great vocals. This song is reminiscent of his classic \\"That Girl\\".), \\"Doctor Faith\\" (a great pop/rock track with impressive guitar chords & wonderful backing vocals. This track features the legendary Michael McDonald on vocals), \\"Help Me Cry\\" (a slow build-up track to a great melody), \\"Still I Resist\\" (great orchestral base track & vocals), \\"Poor Man's Ectasy\\" (mid-tempo rock track) & \\"Everything\\". Okay tracks are \\"I'm Too Old For This\\" & \\"Rescue\\". On overall, this is a great CD release by a masterful singer-songwriter, a highly recommended CD listening.
B004LQ1XBY|5.0|\\"Let Them Talk\\" is so smooth and easy listening!  I love the blues and am very happy with this album!      Hugh is a terrific musician with a gift and passion he wants to share with the world. Hugh & his amazing band pay an an incredible tribute to some of the finest blues ever recorded as well as the legendary artists. I don't know which song is my favorite because I love them all! So beautifully done and I loved that Irma Thomas, Dr. John and Tom Jones were a part of it too.     People who love the blues will enjoy this passionate tribute from the soul and those who don't know much about the blues may be turned on to it!

B00004W3L3|5.0|Being a product of the 70's, I remember when you would purchase a Tull, Genesis, Crimson, ELP, ect., C.D., or album, and listen to every song on it.  Well that has become a thing of the past.  Well, than a friend turned me on to Marillion.  They sound like Genesis before Peter Gabriel left, but not annoyingly so.  They are not a Genesis Wannabe band, as their works stand very well on their own.<br />This c.d., has their biggest hit, Kayleigh, but if you're a progressive rock nut like me, it's not Kayleigh which led me to buy this c.d..  It is Marillion's mastery of the melodic, and distinct layering which bands now only dream of achieving.<br />If you haven't yet discovered Marillion, It's time you did, and this is a great c.d. to start with.  Oh, and Kayleigh  a brilliant song.<br />I so wish there were bands like Marillion around still.  I've purchased the rest of their library in the meantime.  Absolutely breathtakingly, refreshingly great band!
B000PMGS8G|1.0|Wow! I was about to attack Flash Gordon in review form as a stupid, poorly acted disaster of a film, but upon looking over what others had to say about it, I discovered there's a lot of folks who love it for the very things that put me off! Again, wow! I was in high school when this came out in the wake of the Star Wars phenomenon and I remember reading articles in Starlog Magazine about it before it hit theaters. It left a generally positive impression on me, but I haven't really thought a whole lot more about it for the past 30 or so years, although I credit this film with introducing me to Timothy Dalton, who I later became more aware of when he served his time as Bond (but he was better in The Rocketeer - which again puts him in a 1930s setting). I recently decided to see Flash Gordon again when a closeout sale presented a cheap copy of the DVD.  To my older self, the best thing about this film is by far the theme song by Queen. The story is silly and ridiculous (what's with the spaceship in the greenhouse? - but that's literally just the beginning), the acting (especially that of lead Sam J. Jones) is awful, and the special effects are laughable (although there's a couple of shots of the retro ships passing over the alien planetscapes which I kinda like).  In this version, Flash is an American football hero who, through a series of highly unlikely events, ends up getting shot into space where he and companion Dale Arden have to stop Ming the Merciless by uniting the leaders of the kingdoms under Ming.  In this viewing, it really struck me that the filmmakers were actively trying to emulate the 1930s origins of this property.  In many ways, it looks more like a stage play. The set designs (which just look like big open sound stages to me), the costumes (the cobra snake people with their eyes and faces in their mouths are especially bad), and Ming's planet-palace really look as if they could have been taken out of storage for this film after 70 years. This film really isn't my thing and I doubt I'll ever waste two hours of my life watching this again. If I'm looking for something silly and dumb, I'm more likely to seek out Hudson Hawk or Big Trouble in Little China. But if you're one of those people who like camp or actually want to watch this over and over, enjoy yourself!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Absolutley amazing ! It's not often I buy a CD and have more than 2 or 3 songs that I actually listen to.  I love every song on \\"21\\".
B0034G4P80|4.0|I watched the non-3D version.    The story is quite predictable which might not be bad for which is based on a comic.    No regret for spending time and money for it.    The action sequences are good.    They have chosen a good actor for Thor. He does look like the Thor I can imagine of.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I watched this movie for 3 reasons  1) It was recommended to me  2)I love Gerard Butler (fell in love with him after seeing him in PS I love You)  3)I was curious about the story  I rented this movie from Netflix and I admit that at first I was not sure I would like it but by the end I was in tears because of Gerard's awesome performance. I wound up loving this movie so much I had to buy it. I don't have anything negative to say about it. As a matter of fact it's one of the few times I find a movie better than the book.   All the actors were great and it was well cast. I don't know how the original movie compares to this one but I doubt it was better. I also can not believe some of the negatives reviews here about Gerard and the movie. I am SHOCKED at how many people gave it 1 to 2 stars. Not because I am a fan of Gerard's, but If I didn't think he did a great job I would admit it, but Gerard was \\"amazing' as the Phantom and I loved his singing. Actually I thought Gerard was way too handsome for the part but more than happy he was cast in the movie. And personally,I would've picked the Phantom over Raoul anytime if he looked anything like Gerard Butler, disfigured or not. I even purchased music from Itunes to my Ipod because I loved how Gerard sang. Yeah some people didn't like his singing but to each their own. If you listen to what the director said, they weren't looking for someone who sang great but obviously they liked his voice. If it was so bad I don't think he would've been cast for the part or they would've dubbed his voice. I am glad his singing was not dubbed,that would've been disapponinting for me.  I also can't believe anyone would find Gerard Butler 'ugly'. wow. I guess the saying of 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder' really is true. Why someone or some people would even say that about him is very rude and immature. I could see if someone said they didn't find the man attractive but to call him 'ugly' is out of line. There really is no reason forname calling. Ever heard the saying 'If you can't say something nice about someone, don't say anything at all.' And that anyone would call him a bad actor is another shocker. I think he is one of the most talented actors out there. But that is my opinion. I think he is GREAT.
B0032FPVKE|5.0|Highly recommended. Padded, durable, plenty roomy enough for today's tiny little camcorders. Also priced well. You can't really go wrong with this one.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Waited a long time and was not disappointed. The acting was wonderful and displayed the maturity of the cast. Each movie the acting has improved. I loved the books and was worried that they would not be depicted in depth as  so many are, but found the movie flowed beautifully. Am impatiently awaiting the second part from Amazon when it comes out. Ive purchased many books and DVDs from Amazon and am very satisfied with the price and speed of delivery.
B004QPOVF0|5.0|This DVD is awsome.One of the better made ones ac/dc put out as far as way it was made in last few.I liked the bonus features as well like the guitar techs,etc.Much better quality sound and video over past dvd/s,must be advanced newer technology showing itself.Great dvd.If you like ac/dc ,you will like this dvd.And I actually waitied and gave an honest review-waited to review it until after it was actually out and available and I actually saw it,unlike some of the reviews above me who reviewed it before its release date.Amazon shouldn't allow things like that.How can it be reviewed before its for sale?
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Almost halfway thru May. When can we expect the update?????? I cant wait! Pkease release soon or give an estimated time of arrival for us!
B00127RAJY|5.0|At the suggestion of multiple friends, I decided to give this video a go.  I was not let down!  Sure, the music is AWFUL, and some of Jillian's encouragement/phrases get a little annoying at times, but it's an AMAZING workout for muscle strength AND cardio all in one---- and all in under 30 minutes!  Within two weeks of doing this video (of course combined with some better eating choices), I could see more definition in both my arms and my abs.  I'm a Jillian believer!
B0042LJTQO|5.0|Superb and a bargain. Brendel and Kempff are in a special class for Schubert. Kempff's set has all the sonatas, Brendel's has some of the other late pieces but fewer sonatas. Both are top drawer.
B0034G4P80|5.0|I recently saw \\"Thor\\", and really enjoyed it. It had well-drawn characters, good action, and imaginative production design. I also liked the way that it was sit-up-and-take-notice epic yet also surprisingly intimate. The characters genuinely mattered here, which always makes a summer blockbuster better. With the big summer movies, it's not all about the special effects, and never has been.<br /><br />One thing made me smile, though. In the old \\"Thor\\" comics, which debuted in the early 1960's, Marvel's story conceit was that, \\"hey, you know what-- Thor, Loki, and all the other mythical Norse gods were actually real, and here are new stories about them!\\" And the comic book took off, still being published to this day. To my knowledge, no one at Marvel worried, at least with any fervor, that certain groups of people (like Catholics, southern Baptists, devout Jews etc.) might be offended by the notion that the Judeo-Christian God was apparenly being rejected, by a kid's comic book no less, as the only true God out there.<br /><br />Oh, one thing Marvel did eventually do was insert a scene like the following into the comic book every fifty or sixty issues or so:<br /><br />Catholic priest: Thor, thank you for rescuing all our students from their burning school! You're a true hero, even though your very existence flies in the face of the Christian beliefs I hold so dear in my heart!<br /><br />Thor: Verily, thou should not allow thy heart to be troubled, good Father! Thor and his compatriots in noble Asgard have never claimed to be the ultimate forces in the universe. The noble idea of your own Christian God watching us all from above is one that indeed comforts the denizens of Asgard.<br /><br />Catholic priest: (walking away, faith restored) God bless you, Thor!<br /><br />So, you see? At least Marvel threw a small bone to traditional religion by noting that even though the Norse gods were real in Marvel's comic book universe, they didn't claim ultimate supremacy. And that seemed to placate the occasional Marvel editor who presumably was concerned about some kind of backlash from traditional religious quarters, a backlash that never really occured, as far as I know.<br /><br />So, what made me smile in the movie? It seems, almost fifty years after Thor's debut in the comics, now there WAS some genuine worry about offending people with the notion of pagan gods being presented as real beings, or at least as wholesome movie heroes. The movie, you see, goes out of its way to convert the comic book's mystical, magical realm of Asgard, the home of Thor and the Norse gods, into a realm of technological, scientific wonderment instead, with Thor and his compatriots being presented as simply noble, technologically advanced, long-lived beings from another world (albeit with a proclivity for Shakespearean-type dialogue) who were only PERCEIVED as gods when they visited the ancient Norsemen on Earth centuries ago.<br /><br />I mean, it all still works in the movie, and in some ways things are more interesting than they were in the comic book. For example, in the original comics, Bifrost, the majestic, magical Rainbow Bridge that connects Asgard to the physical universe, was just that: a rainbow. Epic, but kind of bland. In the movie, the rainbow bridge is a mighty engineering achievement, crackling with powerful electricity under its ever-churning rainbow coloration, and which connects to a sharp-looking, golden transport chamber, which can shoot Thor and his fellow warriors to any point in the universe. Much more fun.<br /><br />But, yeah, it made me smile that it was probably Hollywood cynicism and fear that for once resulted in better, more interesting story and production elements in the final film. That's not something you see every day.<br /><br />Anyway, Thor is worth a trip to the movies. Its epic grandeur and entertaining, charismatic characters are definitely worth catching on the big screen.r who presumably was concerned about some kind of backlash from traditional religious quarters, a backlash that never really occured, as far as I know.

B0034G4ORM|5.0|This movie tells the story of a small group of Marines, in a bad situation, in small place in time and in a limited scope to the actual \\"war\\", as they follow orders and hold fast to their honor, courage and commitment. As the father of a young Marine, I couldn't help but be emotionally moved to the point of saying to my wife that I really don't want my son to be in combat, knowing full well that he is trained and ready to the mission.    This movie isn't about the aliens as much as it is about these young Marines. The one waiting for his child to be born. The one who looks like he should still be in high school. The officer who has never commanded in combat. The one who is planning to be married. The one who suffers from PTSD. The veteran who is scarred by his past service. All cliches but certainly reflective of today's military service men and women. Open your eyes and see it for what it is. See the sacrifice and the committment. Committment to duty and to one another.     This is not a sci-fi film. It is a film that tells the story of our men and women who serve today, on US soil and foreign shores. It just happens to be in LA and have aliens. This film should make one feel proud of the men and women who serve and feel compassion for those families and military members who suffer great loss due to war. If at the end of the film you don't sit quietly for a moment or two to reflect on what you have seen then I think perhaps you missed the point.    No need to compare to other films, but if we must... Independence day was fun, Skyline was lame, District 9 was very good and intriguing, Black Hawk Down was very good as well. Battle: LA is one of the better \\"war\\" films out.
B001UW58WW|5.0|David Garrett is really quite amazing! I first saw/heard him on the \\"Today Show\\" when he played \\"The 5th\\". What a talent! Not at all hard on the eyes either. I immediately bought the three cds I could find at the time - \\"David Garrett\\", \\"Rock Symphonies\\" and \\"Virtuoso\\". All are outstanding! I've been playing them over and over and never get sick of any of them. It's the only cd I have that my parents also do not get sick of. So, that's really something. Luckily, not long after he was on the \\"Today Show\\", he played here. Of course, I had to get tickets. Took my friends. What a fantastic concert! Anyone who hasn't yet, you must see him live. Not only is a pure joy to see, but, he tells these cute little stories in between each song. He is just adorable! David Garrett is a true Superstar!!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I am a long time customer of Evernote (may be 3yrs now) and its amazing product. The android app does a good job overall, initially it always used to be the poor cousin of iPhone app, but around one year or so it has made tremendous stride in the right direction. It is fast to open, and quick to download your stuff (if it hasn't already downloaded). The widget is great and is especially snappy. If you are a user of Evernote then you would love this app, and they also make update to the app every 45-60 days adding some real functionality.   I think this app is one of app that you have to have it on your phone.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|I had to write a review about this album as I am not a Kanye West fan, but this album won me over.  Over the years I've checked out all of Kanye's albums, but the highest rating I could give to his best album would be 3 stars.  There were many great singles but I found the albums to be boring... never holding my interest for more than few songs.  But that changed with this album.    Right from the start with the opening track Dark Fantasy this one grabs your attention and through out the rest of the album doesn't let go.  Each song has it's own identity with it's unique but accessible sound and catchy hooks.  The songs have a good combination of rapped versus and sung choruses giving balance, never letting the album sink or wane.  If you like the single Power then songs like Monster will blow you away... plus others such as All Of The Lights, Runaway and Hell Of A Life.  And what would a rap album be without cameos?!  This albums has many - Jay Z, Rick Ross, Justin Vernon, Chris Rock and Nikki Minaj with one of the most powerful performances in the last few years (check it out, she's in Monster).  It's obvious after the bashing Kanye took between the Taylor Swift thing and his last album, 808's & Heartbreak, he's feeling inspired - the songs are tight, passionate and most of all sincere.      I recommend this album to anyone who likes Kanye West's singles as it contains 13 tracks that could be played on the radio.  Even if rap isn't your thing you will find something you like in My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.

0714834491|5.0|This book is full of unexpected insights and facts.  I saw it first in my suite at the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas and immediately decided that I had to have my own copy, regardless of cost.
030745455X|5.0|Yes, I know, most reviewers here are saying this is a good book but Dragon Tattoo was better. Nope, really. The first book took a lot of time to set up the characters, one needed a character list to keep track of them all, and the murder mystery was convoluted due to the large number of names. Given, for Swedes, the names may have been more natural and they of all people would have the least trouble confusing all the characters but the Swedes don't make up the majority of the readership of this trilogy. The Girl Who Played with Fire is a well-written book, tighter than the first one, and the story continues to move and not bog down by slow parts such as happened before (where Kalle would get down that he wasn't making more progress, etc). The Girl Who Played with Fire offers MUCH better insight into Lisbeth and into her life. Brailliant!
B004XDYJRU|4.0|This is a great internet radio app.  It has been flawless on my Asus EEE pad Transformer.  Has alart and sleep timer so you can wake up/sleep to your favorite stations. Only 4 stars because not all local stations are available.  No z100 or LifeFM in my area.  Had to install IHeartRadio app for those two stations. (Iheartradio will only do portrait mode) Otherwise, this is an awesome app.
B00509OFE8|5.0|From start to end. This show has been nothing short of amazing. It actually surpassed my expectations from what I thought it be and it's predecessors. I am however heart struck with sadness that this program is coming to it's end. I will only hope there will be a movie to give this series some closure and gratitude and honor to those that have participated in it's beauty. If for whatever reason that fails to manifest. I wish to thank everyone that made this journey you have taken me on. I love you all!     Sincerely,                      Michael
0439023513|4.0|I listened to the Audiobook version.    Of the three, Mockingjay finally lived up the hype. The focus of this book was (finally) on the rebellion, which I found much more interesting than the Games themselves. I only wish we could have seen the same inner struggles during the first two books that we are privy to now in the third. We begin to see the real differences between Peeta and Gale, we watch Katniss devolve into something nearly unrecognizable, and we witness the descent of several main characters into utter despair. The violence was also more shock-worthy (I grew tired of hearing so many reviewers lament how \\"gory\\" the first two were. Please. Book 3 finally starts to approach the level of violence the first two should have had, based on all the talk.) I'm not sure how they are going to make a PG-13 movie out of this last installment.    Having said that, I still found the focus on fashion and television appearances over the top. I get it: the author used to work in the television industry so by gum we are going to get an insider's view of that world, but did it have to bore me with page upon page of superficial details? I think not. (I don't watch TV, so perhaps that's where my impatience with the behind-the-scenes paragraphs comes from.) I also found myself rolling my eyes at several places. For instance, the Capitol's elaborate booby traps were reminiscent of comic books and B-movie evil lairs. It's difficult to take the book seriously and appreciate the message when booby trap-ridden streets feel like they should be accompanied by an interior shot of President Snow laughing maniacally while stroking a hairless cat. It doesn't matter that people die in them; they are still silly.) Likewise, I felt exasperated at the very end of the book during the \\"vote\\" that the survivors took. Once again, my suspension of disbelief was taxed too much and I was ripped out of the story with a huge \\"Oh, come ON!\\" The comparison between the rebels and the Capitol could havebeen made much more effectively with a much more subtle device. Instead the author decided to wallop us over the head with a baseball bat. *oof*    But once I got past that piece of ridiculousness, I did enjoy the rest of the ending, the part that detailed the aftermath of it all, and I appreciated the epilogue, which left me with a nice dose of hope mixed with in with a touch of ominous undertone. Overall, a very enjoyable read.
B002VPE1AW|1.0|Right in the middle of my movie it froze. I looked at the disc and it had many scratches so it wouldn't read anything past about the middle of the movie. I'm not pleased, and I will never order anything from these people again!

B004UID2LC|5.0|Works good for me, watched a video then downloaded it and rewatched the local copy. I'm on an epic 4g so I'm confirming it works on this phone. Aside from the download of the video being a little slow &quot;F#%^ you sprint&quot;. This works as listed!
0345529057|5.0|The five star rating is for the physical product.  The books are nice; they're in a box.  The box is shrink wrapped.  No complaints and, for these days, the price is right.  The content, however, is complete dreck.  The story is predictable.  It is delivered in a teasing, bait & switch style.  Epic fantasy?  \\"A Song of Fire & Ice\\" is more like \\"The Sopranos With Swords\\".
0143038419|5.0|On some objective level, I can understand why some would be disappointed by the book. Disappointed or maybe just \\"yupp, it sucks, I knew it would\\". In fact, when I first got the book in 2007, it was a gift for my mom. I thought \\"this is exactly the sort of cheesy crap that she likes\\". But she never read it.     Finally, I picked it up. And I'm so grateful I did. This book turned around my year. After having a horrible couple of months, I started to pick myself up again. And while I'm pretty confident that I would have a good month either way (when you leave a dark place, anything seems amazing), I'm equally confident that, without this book, it would not have been nearly as good as it was.     This book taught me so much. I learned about cutesy little Italian phrases and I learned about some historical tidbits of India and Indonesia. But in a loftier sense, this book taught me how to really reflect on my life without being melodramatic. It provided me with material that I could use to bounce off of. My journal has never, ever been that interesting in my life. And I've been writing in journals for years.    Thank you so much, Elizabeth Gilbert. You made \\"March 2011\\" -- the most exciting, eye opening month I've had in a long time -- possible.
B00005OWIU|5.0|This is the essential music, the music we all associate with the magic of the first movie.  There's really no point in saying anything else.
630542845X|5.0|This movie touched me deeply!!  Powder obviously had a higher power, and I believe it was revealed when he went to the sheriff's house to see his wife who was dying.  She believed he was an angel, and Powder was able to put her at peace and rest letting her know that her husband and son would reconcile.  Sad how we look at those who are different from the norm, as freaks and outcasts.    Blessed are those who believe but yet have not seen.  I believe that at the end of the movie, God called him back to heaven.  You never know when you might be entertaining an angel!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|And to all the people who have a problem with the app store, or a problem following simple download instructions, don't give the game a bad review. Give Amazon a bad review or your school for passing you when you can't read.
B002NT3B52|1.0|I am so disappointed. I cannot get past past 19 percent on my Kindle and would not recommend this book to anyone. I thought I would get interpretations of her dog and her life experiences with the dog. I just can't figure out where the author is going with this and what she is thinking. I really should have read the other reviews and a passage of the book. Probably my own fault for assuming what this book was about.
031606792X|2.0|I had to add my own 2 cents because a lot of these reviews just cracked me up. 4 is the first of the twilight series that I'm actually reading, but it follows the same annoying, can't tear my eyes away from the train wreck tenor as the movies had. I still want to smack the crap out of Bella. Tell Jacob and Edward to grow a pair and basically puke at how sickeningly sweet all of these characters are even when they're tearing the throats out of elk. ANYWAY, I do like Emmett. For those of you who didn't like the unbelieveable story line, well, it is a story about vampires, ummm, yeah .... It is a guilty pleasure ... It's not Hemmingway by any stretch of the imagination, but it was fun. So on those nights that you're feeling particularly stupid, pick up this book and have at it.
B002AOWXQ8|5.0|With Oasis technically breaking up I needed a new favorite band. Many auditioned many failed. Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros didn't audition, they just sang songs that made them happy. that made me happy, I love this band and loved the follow up album Alexander
B00009L1TA|5.0|was an awesome movie that replaces a movie which I had worn out, I had a seperate disk for 4 years and watched it, easy 500 times, and needed to be replaced. This was a wonderful disk to refurbish my disc library.    Thank You    Grant
B001PB3RU8|5.0|Great album,    I really enjoy her voice and the talented musicians behind her. Plus she's really cute in person. One concern though is this album seems to promote violent boyfriend / girlfriend relationships which probably isn't healthy. I'd give a full review but it's not my kids that are going to listen to it, it's yours.
B002ZG9846|5.0|I could watch this all day, every day. Great acting, great action, and a heroine that'll keep you on the edge of your seat! She proves that little girls aren't just sugar and everything nice- they're full of things that'll take you to the edge of death and push you over!<br /><br />I highly recommend this and give it my seal of approval.
B004LGPBZI|5.0|I expected this to be a crash and fail. WRONG. I love the album, not as good as Oasis and a bit self righteous at time (it's Liam Gallagher what do you expect?) But it's made it's way into my regular rotation.
030746363X|5.0|I was kind of worried when the book arrived and it was almost the size of my biology text book, but once I started reading I realized I only needed to read what was pertinent to the changed I wanted to make.  The book is well written and actually entertaining.  Ferriss' conversational and witty style makes it an easy and enjoyable read. The steps are clear and he has great research to back up his methods. The diet is working great so far and is easily sustainable longterm.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is trying to make a body change.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|What is it with fourth seasons.    Best season of Dexter, best season of the wire, best season of the Simpsons... odd.     If season six is as bad as five was, I'll pretend it was canceled after this season.
B003ZSJ212|2.0|...is that box REALLY bearing the artwork for the Complete Saga? If so, it's hideous. If not, it's still hideous. Based on what some folks have already written here on Amazon, I went over to the official site to find the actual specs. That's specs as in aspect ratio, transfer rate, format, languages, etc. And you know what? I couldn't find them. Maybe you'll have better luck searching than I did, but this does not bode well for what these discs will contain. You'd think LucasArts, or any studio, would be trumpeting that these blu-rays are prepared using the highest transfer rate available, that they're new digital \\"prints\\" taken direct from the masters, that this is the definitive version of each film...unless, of course, they aren't. I sincerely hope I'm wrong but...I've got a bad feeling about this.
B00006JL1Z|4.0|yes sir    if you really like Fleetwood Mac this is pretty grand. In hindsight I would probably just buy the Rumors Album as there were a lot of songs on here that I don't think are that great. In my opinion that shouldn't happen for a greatest hits album.
031261246X|4.0|I really liked this book. The subject matter of cyber-terrorism is a modern day threat and a definite possibility as well. I enjoyed the development of the characters throughout the story and the way the various characters and sub-plots drew closer and eventually merged at the ending. The main character, Jeff, was a realistic person trying to deal with a seemingly insurmountable problem. He wasn't the standard adventure character with years of military special operations training, he was a regular Joe Geek who had a lot of knowledge and experience in the computer, hacker and intelligence world and good enough ethics to try to do the right thing.    I also enjoyed how Russinovich developed the bad guys in this story. Many authors don't take the time to delve into this side of the story or explain what makes the other side tick and make the decisions that they do.     I thought the ending was a little bit of a surprise, which I enjoyed. Real stories don't always end with everything tied up in a nice little package and this story shows that even defeating a monstrous cyber-attack like the one in Zero Day won't end the war.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I very much enjoyed this novel, quick moving, characters to care about and all written by the family dog.  I truly loved the ending.    My only complaint was that Denny, the father and dog owner, just ran into one too many difficulties along the way.
0385732554|4.0|\\"The Giver\\" by Lois Lowry is actually, unbeknownst to me prior to my reading it, a dystopian novel about the coming of age and the coming to wisdom and understanding of a young boy in a futuristic society. A book I missed reading in school, but which my children were exposed to in my own childrens' time, this is somewhat dated in spots, I felt, but held the same sort of message that we hear and see in our own world and society today through a plethora of young adult literature.  That alone makes it worthy of reading!<br /><br />It's a small book, but every page is profound. Lois Lowry knows how to write exactly like my Rhetoric professor wanted us to write...with precision and acuracy. Her every word has a purpose and meaning. And, in that instance, we discover that we need to pay attention, acutely, to what she's telling us.<br />This is a serious book with a warning for young and old, alike.<br /><br />I found it most poignant that Ms Lowry wrote \\"The Giver\\" for young people at their pivitol age.  It's a book that is meant to make them consider the society they are apart of without a doubt, but it's also meant to make them question the world and the ways of life they've taken for granted. It hopes, it seems, to help them shed the scales from their eyes and take the plugs from their ears...to have the courage to rise up again the norm.  For that alone, I found it worthy of the Newberry Prize.<br /><br />It seems to me that as adults we fear young people. We want to corral them, to keep them in check, to make sure they don't skate board near the Library. There's alot about them that reeks of uncontrollable power and unhinged disaster. There's impulse on edge, and the half-here-and-half-there sense of what's going to really damage their lives and the lives around them, and what's not.  Because of this, teens and pre-teens have this magical quality to them...this freshness of vision coupled with this wildness of vision like the boys in \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" like those vampires and psychics and witches they \\"wanna be\\" in the YA novels.<br /><br />In \\"The Giver\\" we see such power in the young protagonist. He is pent up and on the verge of destruction in several instances. We see him risk breaking serious rules only to see him pull back and turn to the side of wisdom to protect those he loves.  This is the quality that Lois Lowry is telling the young to emulate, this is the hidden treasure that the Giver has to offer~this potential to create a new system lovingly, or simply to destroy mindlessly.<br /><br />Ms Lowry acknowledges the terrible strength and power of the young adult to be victorious or to vanquish and offers an instruction of vision, values and valor.  In a society where everything is ordered, equal, peaceful and happy...life is not valued, and people deemed less than fit for society are done away with like old newspaper.<br />\\"The Giver\\" is a book worthy of literary and humanitarian awards, and it's a book worthy of being the classic it's become.<br /><br />I strongly recommend \\"The Giver\\" to everyone, young and old, who hasn't already read it...and even to those who have.  It's a good time to reread this book. It's an especially good time to read it...<br /><br />Deborah/TheBookishDamewitches they \\"wanna be\\" in the YA novels.

B004MKM8L8|3.0|Having watched all of the previous Harry Potter movies and read all of the books I am not impressed with this movie.  The fist five movies were very good, but the Half Blood Prince and the Deathly Hallows felt very different.  The Deathly Hallows, Part 1 consisted of random scenes splashed together with seemingly no flow to it.  Coupled with Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe's) mediocre performance, this film is a mess.  With regards to the story, this is a very depressing time for Harry and his friends, but Radcliffe displayed almost no emotion during the entire film.  It's understandable that Harry and his friends would be a bit moody, but there was no passion in Harry's voice, especially for what he and his friends had sacrificed to find the horcruxes (Hermoine was on par and Ron was good as always though).  For example, when Harry was asked if it felt better to take one of the horcruxes from around his neck he quickly said to Hermione \\"Loads.\\"  I didn't sense that his character felt any better for having it away from him because of how he delivered the line.  There was no weight to that scene, and that was not the only one.  Most of the time, Harry just sat there in uncomfortable silence when he was asked a question or spoken to.  I felt myself hoping the characters got through the scenes without messing up their lines.    There was an awkward dancing scene along with awkward kissing scenes that added nothing to the film.  For example, Ginny shows up out of no where, Harry and her make out and then that's it...nothing else is spoken about their relationship or anything from the book.  Don't even get me started about the scene with the obviously computer generated half naked Hermoine and Harry walking toward Ron while he is trying to destroy the horcrux....weird!  Strange kissing scene ensues  My last upsetting issue was regarding the dark mood and some of the disturbing scenes (beware parents, I'm sure this movie will give the little ones nightmares - I will not let mine watch this one).  The dark mood is awkwardly peeled away at certain points to let in misplaced humor (noteably by Fred and George).  The Harry Potter series has lost it's fun feel and gone dark big time.  Not really a fan of that change, but I know the story has changed and things are not as they were.  Personally I blame Rowling locking herself up away from her family to write the final Harry Potter books (may or may not be true).  I heard that somewhere and I think that her isolation from her family didn't make for the best material for this book.    This is not a bash Radcliffe session as there were others to blame.  Ultimately I blame the director as he could have made the scenes better, especially with transitioning them better.  While I am on the subject and bashing away, let me throw this in.  I say fire the current Harry and replace him with Frodo from Lord of the Rings for the final part 2.  It's easy to explain, Harry did a face changing spell that backfired and is now permanent.  Also, fire the director and get someone talented in there, not one of these dime a dozen ones.  That's my take and I hope you enjoyed it.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This app is incredible and I would reccomend it to anyone. I use it all the time on my DroidX to pick up sports talk radio. 2 months ago while we were on a trip to GA I asked my wife what station she listened to growing up in NY and we put into the TuneIn Radio and in no time we were listening to some Long Island classic rock.

B003UESJH4|5.0|A sensitive and beautifully acted film that depicts a little known--to me, at least--fact of history i.e. that the Duke of York, the man who would become King George the VI of England, had a terrible stuttering problem.  It shows how he and his elocution instructor have to overcome the barriers of position and class to provide a modicum of relief for a King who is expected to give soul-stirring speaches during the depths of WWII.<br /><br />Significant undercurrents are the stresses laid upon the person who will be King and the possible consequences of abdication.  The Duke of York's older brother--the man upon whom Kingship should fall--abdicates the throne for the 'woman I love'--Wallace Simpson, an American divorcee.  This film suggests that this abdication is not just about the intensity of 'love' but also an abdication of personal responsibility.  George VI, despite his fears and limitations, doesn't bow to his fears.  He proves himself something of a hero.<br /><br />Did it heavily influence the history of the world?  Maybe.  The man who would be King--the lover of Wallace Simpson--was also strongly pro-German.  Granted, the monarchy had already been shorn of most of its authority but had an English King favored alliance with Germany, who knows what could have happened?
0316056863|5.0|I purchased the audio book and found myself laughing inappropriately while out in public. You know how when some people are talking on their bluetooth headsets but you think they are talking to you? Or worse, you think they are crazy self-mumblers? While listening to Tina Fey's Bossypants outside the security bubble of my own home, I'm sure many strangers shot me crazy-looks when I burst out laughing all by myself for no apparent reason in the dry dog food aisle of my grocery store.    Why do I suggest purchasing the audio book instead of the actual book (or purchase both if you can)? If you are a Tina Fey fan, she narrates the book in her own funny, quirky way. Her comedic timing is excellent and adds depth to her punchlines that you may not be able to extract as wholly from a text format. You can just imagine her talking to you the way Liz Lemon does on 30 Rock. If you are not a Tina Fey fan, the audio book is an equally great purchase because you get to hear her many impressions and sarcastic tones. I also get the feeling that many of the jokes in Bossypants are better listened to instead of read. For example, hearing Tina deliver a funny sentence makes that sentence more humorous than reading it because reading it might just make me think, \\"Oh... what a weird sentence. I don't get it.\\"     I am going to purchase the book book even though I have the audio version because I like the feeling of owning the tangible property of someone's written mind. I also like the feeling of being able to flip through pages of bound paper.     In Bossypants, Tina Fey takes you through how she got started, her father, SNL, 30 Rock, Sarah Palin, being a woman, the birth of her daughter, breastfeeding, and more. Her audio book was a great experience for me because it was funny and stress relieving. I liked that I could lie back on my sofa, plug her in my ears, and listen to her story without falling asleep and ruining my sleep schedule for the week when my eyes were sore from a day of staring at the computer in the office. Don't me wrong, I wasn't cracking up at every single word in the book. There were some chapters that were just okay, but nicely dotted punctuations of funniness made the book great.    I have this feeling that had I read the book first instead of listening to it, I would not have liked it as much. At any rate, I would recommend Bossypants as light reading or listening for anyone. If you are a 30 Rock fan, this book will be perfect for you. It's a great window into Tina Fey's life and perspective and makes you appreciate how and why this woman is so lovable. I AM a fan of Tina Fey and 30 Rock, but I were not a fan, I would still have enjoyed this book.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|This was a wonderful plot driven show. Syfy put it in an awful time slot to make room for WWE Smackdown. I can never watch the show on TV due to the fact, I AM AT WORK WHEN IT IS ON THE AIR. I have to wait until the next day when Amazon has it up and buy the episode I did not get to watch. And I don't mind paying to watch an episode of a show I truly enjoy. If Syfy would get their act together and put good shows in a proper time slot, then I am sure the ratings for this show (and many others) would grant an renewal.     And Syfy needs to stop promoting \\"Ghost Hunters\\". This show was real compared to the crap they \\"hunt\\".\    Remember \\"Good Vs. Evil\\"?
B002OOG6YY|4.0|This is what blu-ray is all about people. This concert captures shock-rocker Marilyn Manson at his prime during the height of his controversial career. Great audio quality, superb picture and Marilyn Manson's pasty white ass. The concert includes some of Manson's most notable songs, such as The Beautiful People, Disposable Teens and The Dope Show. If you aren't a fan of Manson then i would pass on this purchase, but for anybody that has a fascination with the macabre then this is the show for you!
B002VPE1OS|1.0|While the instructions were simple and easy to follow and the tools provided great, the film was impossible to apply correctly. I was unable to get the bubbles out and had to throw away all three films. I had no problems with Apple's screen protector. I wanted to save a few bucks, the reviews were good so I tried the Amazon version. BIG MISTAKE. I would not recommend this product. Stick with Apple.
B003DWC6LI|5.0|This is a fab book and so much better than the movie (well it is!). I love the story, the characters and the comedy. I suspect I'm not the only one, but there are elements of me in Bridget, and that's what makes me love this book so much. Bridget has a bit of every woman in her, and we love her for showing it.    It's a great re-working of Pride and Predjudice too on a modern level, the social satire and romantic passion fits wonderfully alongside Jane Austen's novel.     Great book, can't recommend it enough!
0143113100|4.0|I need all the help that is available as my husband had a significant stroke episode 3 months ago. I have only begun to read the book when I can find a few minutes but it is very interesting
B000089QEN|5.0|This the best of the several movie versions of Vanity Fair, which is one of my favorite novels.  The writers have done a thoughtful job selecting from among the numerous episodes and plotlines in the book, and, as one would expect from a British production, the acting is superb.  Particularly notable are the Becky Sharp (a lovely creature) and William Dobbin, who has to \\"say\\" a great deal without talking.  After seeing it on TV, I bought the set so I can watch it repeatedly.  There has been considerable criticism of the music; I found it not particularly special but easy to ignore.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|As I watched this documentary I was really amazed at how well they did with gathering staggering amounts of information and interviews and then made a terrific film. I'd vote this the best documentary of the year.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|I simply love this series!  It has all the drama and action of Battlestar Galactica with Stargate themes.  It had a slow start but this last season was simply action packed, thrilling and full of twists.  I don't like how it ended in a cliffhanger though!  Still, maybe the executives will wisen up and do a movie or miniseries to finish up the story line at least.  Still hoping for a 3rd season though.
B004HAG40O|5.0|This latest album is another shining example of why I love this band so much.  I also live near Portland Oregon and having the chance to see them play live here in their home town on many occasions is nothing but an awesome experience each time.<br /><br />This album brings a fresh change and some new melody's, but it still has those awesome 10 minute songs that blend so well into each other. Hazards of Love was probably my climax in the chronology of their music, and I think that is exactly what they wanted for their fans.  This is the mellow album after coming off the Hazards of Love.  It's all such a well told musical story, and the best part its not over...

SO CREEPY!!!  i'm so glad i didn't get this book.  not sure what's wrong with the authors who wrote this book.  i still get the heebee jeebees thinking about this book.
B004TJ1H3C|1.0|If you are/were a fan of this show, do not buy this.  The show ends horribly and you are left wanting more.  Save yourself the heartache and trouble and wait to buy this until (if) they announce movies to fulfill the storyline.  I can not be more dissatisfied with the way this show ended.
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|Not much to say about this other than it's a very solid pool/snooker/etc game.  I mostly just play it for the pool so I can't comment much on the other play types but the pool works very well.  Connecting with an opponent online is quick and painless and makes for an interesting game.  Highly recommend this app if you enjoy pool!
B000002KKS|4.0|By the time Sabbath had begun pre-production on this release, Ozzy was well out of the band. The situation was amicable in that it was obvious over the last few years and albums, things were just not the same within the group and it was out of absolute necessity that a split was needed. By chance while in Los Angeles, Tony Iommi had bumped into Ronnie James Dio at a party and the two had struck up a cordial meeting there and then and within a matter of days, it was apparent that the pair of them were in complete continuity with one another. At the time, Sabbath were in disarray and Geezer had left home for England for a time and while it wasn't ruled out, he was ineffectively not part of the band. Bill Ward had also done much of the same, but once the sessions began for the new record he was present and accounted for.<br /><br />The music that was created within this record was a tremendous boost to Sabbath's lagging career and gave the band a whole new lease of life and the opportunity to move forward. Though Dio's vocal style was significantly different from that of Ozzy's, it opened up a broader spectrum from where Iommi could work within his style and writing with Dio proved to be a catalyst for injecting a brand new vision to the faltering situation of the past. Neon Knights opens up the record with absolute fury and a power not seen as strong since Sabotage. Dio's lyrics usually dealt with a Dungeons and Dragons, medievel aspect, specifically from his days with Ritchie Blackmore in Rainbow, and that is kind of what he brought here to the new album; yet, even so, Dio is able to mix those themes with that of a modern-day \\"down to earth\\" flavor with tracks such as Die Young and Walk Away being fine examples.<br /><br />The title track has become a staple and one of the most revered songs within this phase of the band's career. It wins in spades with Dio's vocal delivery, the song's plodding, moody melody and Iommi's most arresting guitar lines to date on any Sabbath recording. Children of the Sea is yet another barnstormer with an ambient acoustic intro and through onto the main theme of the track which offers up another sustaining song into the variatable Sabbath catalogue. Wishing Well is a fast paced number that features even more blistering Iommi lead breaks and a very tight and smoldering performance from Sabbath. Lady Evil is perhaps, a bit of Rainbow influence here in melody and lyrical similarities and while a bit tongue in cheek, it fits in with the overall flow of the record. Lonley is the Word closes this set on a most powerful note and is a trudging war horse type of number. Dio's singing really brings a whole new element to the band and while this divided the Sabbath fan base down the middle, I think its a bit silly to measure Oz and Dio side by side in that respect; both singers were equally adept in their styles and the way that they worked within the different phases of the band. The idea here is that this is a new group with a fresh new slant on things. Say what you want about Dio, in my mind, you either love him or hate him. It's that simple, really. 4 and a half Stars.Children of the Sea is yet another barnstormer with an ambient acoustic intro and through onto the main theme of the track which offers up another sustaining song into the variatable Sabbath catalogue.

B00003CX5P|5.0|The Phantom Menace is an UNDERRATED MASTERPIECE!!!!! &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; WOW! The audience went ape s-(well you know the rest) every time I saw it. I couldn't get it out of my head, I read the novel 3 times (after I seen the film) that summer, as well as the screenplay. Man I love this film, and the more I see it the more I love it. Qui-Gon, Darth Maul and Watto three of my top ten favorite characters. 8 times between May and Dec. of '99, and every time I seen it the crowd cheered, and at the end erupted in applauds. It was cool, very cool. For me I didn't want to see a rehash of ANH, and what I got was a new twist to and old universe. I was pleasantly surprised by the out come, of all three prequels. To this day I still LOVE this movie. It's just gets better and better!
B004BSFSTA|3.0|These are nice headphones.  good construction, comfortable.  I also appreciate the coiled cord.    however, I would not say they are superior to a pair of  $20-$30 Sonys, Panisonics or Zumreeds.    And they do muffle sound but not enough to compete with  noise canceling headphones.    There is no question you are paying for the name here  and for a little style.    i have to deduct two stars simply for cost vs. value  but they are very good if you have the money to burn
0307595862|4.0|Having read Stieg Larsson's novels, I was looking for similar reads.  This one makes the list.  It is #7 in a series starring Detective Harry Hole.  This crime mystery had me guessing up to the end of the book.  The evidence pointed to 3 different people that could have been the Snowman who was responsible for many gruesome deaths.<br /><br />Overall the book was well written and I found it hard to put down. I found the characters to be believable and well depicted. Even the evidence that linked the deaths was different and interesting.<br /><br /> I will seriously consider reading the first 6 books in the series now, and I hope there will be an 8th.

B0032Y0OH0|5.0|I bought [[ASIN:B001F42MKG Logitech Trackman Marble Mouse]] a few weeks back and was dissatisfied with the lack of a scroll wheel.  I bought the Shuttle Xpress primarily to function as a scroll wheel for typical use.  I started using it to the left of my keyboard so I could use my right hand on the mouse.  So far I couldn't be happier with it.      For many applications I use it simply as a scroll wheel, much like a typical mouse has, with the Jog being line-by-line scroll and the shuttle being fast scroll.  At first I was afraid that using two hands instead of one for simple navigation would pose a problem, but the opposite has turned out to be true.  By binding several of the most common keyboard tasks to the shuttle Xpress, navigation is actually faster.    The software is pretty robust.  The shuttle dial has 7 increments in both directions.  Each of these increments can be programmed much like a button.  The Jog dial is essentially the same as a scroll wheel on a mouse.  There are 5 buttons, each can be assigned as a modifier key (control, shift, etc.), a combination of keys, or a special function and this action can be repeated at specified intervals.  This isn't as flexible as some macro key pads are, which often allow for timed key combinations, but it's plenty for typical applications.    For specific applications the shuttle Xpress is extremely convenient.  I do a lot of simple video editing and video analysis, and being able to efficiently navigate frame-by-frame, fast forward, and rewind is amazing.  Having a jog & shuttle dial is a huge improvement over the mouse and keyboard setup I normally use.  It is great for recreational playback of video as well.  I haven't gotten the chance yet to test it in all of my computer tasks, but when I do I will update my review.    I think you could make this device useful for nearly any task, the problem is that it requires some creativity on the part of the user to decide what the bindings should be.  Basically, don'texpect this to be a install-and-done sort of device, it will take some tweaking.
B004HU6YZ4|2.0|I don't think that there was Social Distortion album that I didn't like until this one. It just doesn't sound like them. Yes, I agree that bands, like people evolve and change, but that doesn't always mean it's a good thing. If you're into this sound then good for you, but for me it's two stars.
0375842209|5.0|I was recommended this book by a close friend and decided to give it a try.  For a while, I've been looking for a book that would take my breath away and with which I would feel something bigger than myself.  It took a lot of tries most recently but this book finally brought me what I needed.  The point of view from Death is the best way to tell this story from Nazi Germany.  You fall in love with the characters and see from the inside out of a horrible period of history.    I was reading that this is a \\"young adult\\" novel and, while it may be valuable to a younger audience, you cannot truly feel what comes through in this book unless you are a bit older.  I'm disappointed that some who are older might see this as a book below them, but it isn't and the message contained can sometimes only be felt by a more mature audience.    This book made me hope, it made me cry.  It made me feel something inside that only gets stirred by something this great.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to feel something and connect with something bigger, to feel meaning in a sometimes crazy world.  It shows the horrors of war and the power of individual human compassion in the face of evil.  It is the best book I've read this year.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I love this show!  I can't wait until the complete version of Season 2 is released.  The characters are all interesting and have depth to them.  Stefan, Damon, Elena, Jeremey and Bonnie are the anchors of the show.  Matt is also very important! The characterization of Stefan as a good guy who can also, be a bad guy as well as Damon as a bad guy that has some redeeming qualities is great!  Elena and Bonnie are strong female characters that I don't think the show would be as good without either one of them.   The TV version is different than the original books.  I think that is OK as you can't always make a TV show or even a movie follow the original book(s).     I also, love the books that were written by L.J. Smith!  I am very disappointed that the publisher has fired the original writer, L.J. Smith and has appointed someone else to write the story that she created!  I won't be buying anymore of them unless they are written by her.  The whole feeling of the characters is different in the Stefan Diaries.  I realize that they were written to follow the TV show more closely, but the next 3 books should continue the story that has already been started by Ms Smith.    Cameron B Johnson
B00402FGE4|4.0|I'm not the first to mention that SGU looks a lot like Battlestar Gallactica with a stargate. The sets and lighting are dark. Characters are in conflict much like BG. A lone spaceship is up against long odds, surviving on its own without friends ... check.<br /><br />Yet the writers have done a good job of creating a compelling story arc with believable and interesting characters. There is a nice variety of stand alone adventure to go with the continuing plot, and the problems faced are entertaining. Throw in a touch of Gilligan's Island as the voyagers occasionally have ephemeral prospects of rescue dangled before them, and the show has borrowed from just about every popular sci-fi/marooned cast series you might be able to name. Despite this, I find almost every episode to be an interesting watch ... unlike Santuary, which teeters precipitously between fascinating and boringly tedious (and is still in production anyway).<br /><br />SGU may signal the end of the very long running Stargate franchise. That's a shame. I've enjoyed it since the first episode of Stargate, which in a change from the normal circumstance was so much better than the movie it wasn't even close. I'll miss it, as I miss new Star Trek.<br /><br />However, this first season doesn't have to worry about cancellation. It built a premise and built it well. Its a good rendition of the desert island theme, with the marooned crew making do with what they have, discovering what their tools can do, and developing new ways to find supplies and survive. However, I'd look to watch the reruns on cable before I plopped down the cash for the DVDs.
030726999X|5.0|This book picks up right where The Girl who Played with Fire left off.  Lisbeth is rushed to the hospital to save her life and Michael Blomkvist is the man that saved her.  Then this story takes so many twists and turns that sometimes my head was spinning, but you have to just hang in there and see where this masterful author takes us.<br /><br />***Possible spoliers but I think that most people have read this by now - I was late to the game*****<br />While our gal Lisbeth is recovering in the hospital we find out dear old dad is just down the hall from her plotting how to kill her.  He is a vishous, hideous person who gets his due from the secret police.  The way that took place shocked me (I won't spill all the details).  I had no idea that the old man from the secret police was going to do that - I think I just assumed that he wanted to talk to him.  That is why I am not a writer and instead a mortgage banker.<br /><br />Michael's sister, Giannini defends Lisbeth and is at first frustrated with her, as most people are.  Giannini is a women's rights advocate and attorney and since Lisbeth's entire life has been one violation after another, she is the perfect person to help.<br /><br />Lisbeth also garners a new ally in the way of her physician who partners up with Blomkvist to smuggle in her handheld computer.  This of course, helps her do her cyber spying, etc. and she even helps out Erika Berger on her quest to find out who is stalking her; and this is woman that Lisbeth considered her competition for Michael.  Eventually we get to court where Lisbeth is beign tried for many broken laws,etc. and she again just astounds me.  From the way she dressed in court to the way she answered or did not answer questions on the stand.  I loved the way that Giannini ripped Telaborian to shreds.<br /><br />Lisbeth is such a multi layered, well written character that I just loved her from the first time she hit the pages in the first book.  She has a sense of rite and wrong and is able to elicit loyalty from people without even knowing it.  Read these books - you will not be disappointed, well the only disappointing thing is that the author passed away before the books were published and that we have no more of his really great storytelling to read.people without even knowing it.

B002IVLH60|5.0|I just discovered Pearl Jam in October 2010, and have been enjoying listening to all their albums, including Backspacer. Although there are songs I love on every single one of their albums, Backpacer is the only one where I love every song. Of course I love some more than others-Force of Nature is my top favorite, but Just Breathe, Unthought Known, The Fixer, and Got Some rank high in my book. I have also noticed how Eddie's vocals sound even better on here than on the \\"Avocado\\" album.     If you are a brand new fan or have been a fan of PJ for many years, I highly recommend this album.
B004ZGI2KK|1.0|I normally don't waste my time writing reviews on bad films - but this one was so exceptionally poor if I can spare someone the grief, it will be worth it.   The visual design is rather fun and fairytale like, and Gary Oldman makes an appearance with some decent acting. Other than that, there are no other redeeming qualities to this film.   The script is pathetic.    Who funds these films?   A very sad commentary on imagination and the lack of artistry and intelligence in film.

B004KPLVW2|5.0|Come on, it's Tron. In high definition! Of course it's great! I bought this version because it was cheaper to get this and the sequel separately than it was to get them packaged together.     And it comes with a DVD copy too (also very good quality video and sound), so I am not restricted to watching the film in one room (can't expect many people to have more than one blu ray player except hardcore film buffs). Great value, five stars!
B002PEP4HI|5.0|Mitch Albom's Have a Little Faith was recommended to me by a friend, and I took her advice and got it on my Kindle.  I was a little curious about what it was about, because my friend didn't really tell me, but I'd read Albom's other books and really liked those, but I was in for a great surprise when I started reading this one.  For one thing, I couldn't stop reading.  Mitch Albom's story of how he met with his lifelong rabbi, fondly called the Reb, and how he worked out the details of the Reb's request for Mitch to give the eulogy at his funeral was so inspiring and so spiritual, that I wanted to go find a rabbi and talk to him even though I'm not Jewish.  What a wonderful tale of a rabbi's life in faith and his faith in life, and his observations of life and of Mitch Albom's dawning awareness of his own faith and spirituality, and the gratitude that he finds through an old neighborhood acquaintance that he meets up with while working with the Reb.  I loved this book for one basic reason.  Whether we're Jewish, Catholic, Presbyterian, Muslim, or Shinto, we're not so very different as we think.  I've read most of this a second time, deleted it from my Kindle and re-downloaded it again.  It's a must-read and a keeper for me to go back to every once in awhile when I need a reminder about having a little faith.

0061148512|5.0|While \\"The Bell Jar\\" has appeared on high school reading lists for quite a long time, I don't know many teachers who have actually made it a part of their curriculum. Perhaps they see it as a book for adolescent girls and thus unlikely to appeal to teenage boys? That's a shame. It's beautifully written and, to my mind, it stands the test of time, unlikely, say, other golden oldies like the moribund \\"A Separate Peace\\" or even \\"A Catcher in the Rye.\\"<br /><br />The boy problem is easily solved, since this novel, a thinly disguised memoir set in the fifties, has its perfect opposite number in a fifties \\"boy\\" memoir: \\"This Boy's Life\\" by Tobias Woolf.  Both books raise the interesting question: how has life changed for teenagers since the fifties and how has it remained the same? Taught together, they would illuminate for both genders the process that's usually referred to as \\"coming of age\\" but, as regards these two books, might better be described as the process of beginning to see the world as an inexperienced (and also fascinated) adult. This sort of perspective would most appeal to high school juniors and seniors. Although \\"Catcher\\" is a standard in freshman curricula, the sexual episodes in the Plath and Woolf make them best for older students.<br /><br />M. Feldman

My favorite story was the sixth one, but maybe that was because it was the only one that wasn't broken up.  Really liked Sonmi's story, too.  Hard to imagine this being turned into a movie, but supposedly it is.  Wouldn't recommend this book to everyone but it worked for me.  Hard to put down.  And difficult to believe the whole thing was written by one author: chameleon is the first word that comes to mind.

031603441X|3.0|This book is as if Keith drops by your house or lies on the couch and you're his shrink and he tells you the detailed story of his life in mostly chronological order.  Of course as a super-celebrity he gets to break all the rules of both normal behavior and memoir writing - it's not a story with a theme or plot, there is virtually no dialogue, it's stream of consciousness even during periods of Keith's bouts of unconsciousness which of course come often. He's constantly changing verb tense between past and present tense something the rest of us don't get to do. (I'm in the process of getting my memoir published, so I know the rules.) This despite his professional co-author who should have had more impact than it appears he did.  I suspect Keith didn't want anyone including him exerting too much influence.    But then as a celebrity Keith can get away with unstructured writing because of his wild life and famous friends.  In the end I don't find him to be a very likable guy.  He has a violent temper at times and he lashes out - punching people, throwing knives and heavy glass objects at them, usually over a trivial hot-button personal issue where Keith feels wronged in some way.  He gets to be a complete and childish screw-up and gets away with it all the time because he's Keith Richards.  He's a heroin addict through much of the book and rather than consider himself lucky to have survived such stupidity he gloats about how well he handled the stuff.  The fact that others had to always cover for him doesn't seem to have been much of a concern.    But it is a fascinating life and an interesting read - at least the first half is.  Then it just gets repetitious with the drugs -- the parties of drugged out beautiful people, the fights with Anita Pallenberg, the efforts to score smack on the road, the getting busted, the close calls.  He survives it all partly on luck, but mostly on money and celebrity and he comes off looking like a pompous spoiled brat despite his veryreal working class roots and desire to appear a working class hero unlike his cohort and antagonist, one  Mick Jagger.   Yet all Keith's mega-money seems to go to drugs, houses, fancy cars.  I don't think there is one mention of his doing anything for a charitable organization or someone poor who wasn't a fellow musician so his good-guy self-sensibilities ring hollow in his personal life.    He doesn't hold back what he thinks of various people  -- hates some, adores others, mostly depending on how well they served him.   He's appreciative of the people who bail him out, both literally and figuratively, yet oddly does not feel that way towards Mick who had to do it throughout the first 15-20 years of the Stones when Keith was a heroin junkie.  There's not as much on Mick the person as I would have liked and expected- probably because those two guys have always had a contentious relationship and when offstage traveled in different circles.  Keith resents Mick for having the audacity to think he's the kingpin and says Mick often tried to run the band that way and that was the usual reason for Keith for his anger towards Mick.  But the reality is that as good a guitarist as Keith was, Mick was the bigger star.  Without Mick, Keith would have been considered a good guitarist, but unlikely he would have ever been anything close to a superstar.  With another good or great guitarist, Mick probably would have still been a superstar.  Keith gives Mick good marks as a singer, harmonica player, and lyricist.  He says almost nothing about Mick's legendary on-stage performances or even his own.      But there is endless detail of the recording sessions and the getting ready for the recording sessions.  Keith  doesn't use a lot of music jargon, probably because he's self-trained though very serious about his craft but he still over-kills on the musical discussions.  It becomes shop talk, not that interesting to non-professional musicians.  We're treated to a lot of accounts of how certain songs came about, interesting at least at first, just Keith's own unique description of how the music was made and played.   He goes into a lot of detail about people that I and probably you have never heard of.  Keith either loves or hates them.  There's not much in-between.  He's loyal to the ones he likes and threatening to those he doesn't.  There's very little about his wife of the past almost 30 years, particularly considering how much there is of the very disturbed Anita Pallenberg who was his partner in heroin addiction.    Keith is very intent on telling us he's a good humble street guy who never let success get to his head yet he leads a gilded life and gets away with things others never could have without his money and fame.  He considers himself all about the music and Mick an egotistical sell-out.    This sounds too negative, but I'm also being a little generous to give the book 3 stars. 2.6 would be more how I felt throughout this too-long memoir.  There are a lot of attractive things about Keith and this book.  The early years watching him grow up and how he became a musician and the excitement of the Stones becoming huge - are all done well.  Keith admits his foibles, but doesn't seem to regret much of his bad boy behavior.  He would be the last to admit success spoiled him, but reading between the lines, it really did.
B001EN71DG|5.0|I feel like the label for this product is confusing. So this version includes both the original release of the movie as well as the first re-release.

B0040QYROA|4.0|After watching the film Metropolis, I feel like the best part of the film was the striking visuals. Not only did they have a grand set, but the overall choreographed feel of the film made it seem bigger. Seeing a large group of people all doing the same thing at the same time is very powerful and this film uses that to its advantage. The scene of the factory workers that is very choreographed is, to me, one of the most powerful and interesting scenes in the movie. The scene with the group going up the stairs is also quite powerful as it is both grand and choreographed. One of my favorite parts of Metropolis is the original score by Gottfried Huppertz. Since Metropolis is a silent film, the score plays a vital role in conveying what can not be expressed through words. The score is bold when the scenes are large and it gets softer for the more tender moments in the film. Without the score, the film would be lacking. Of course, the film is wonderful and the shots are breathtaking at times, but without the sound to complete the experience, the audience would not be as emotionally involved. Besides the score, I really enjoyed the large scenes of the city because they seem to take you to a world so different from what you know. The city is huge and very technologically advanced, and though we have large cities with huge factories, Metropolis has a dream-like quality very different from what we know. The film is exciting and has a great storyline that keeps the audience interested. I would recommend this to any fans of film or to anyone who likes science fiction. The movie is really great and is sure to keep you on your toes.
B004SC8XHI|3.0|This 1970 album pays tribute to the Beatles studio swan song, [[ASIN:B0025KVLUQ Abbey Road]]. The original album's tracks (save \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer,\\" \\"Oh! Darling\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\") are arranged as instrumentals in three medleys and a solo spotlight of George Harrison's \\"Something.\\" Booker T's organ and piano, and Steve Cropper's guitar provide most of the vocal melody lines. The results are interesting, if not always particularly inventive. Many of the songs find resonance with the group's soulful style, but neither the arrangements nor the performances offer the last-gasp creative dominance the Beatles poured into the final work.<br /><br />By this point in Booker T. & the M.G.'s career, the soul grooves that had backed Stax's great vocal acts and launched iconic instrumental hits were second nature, and perhaps that's part of the problem. A few of the performances, such as \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and \\"You Never Give Me Your Money,\\" fail to strike any new sparks, and sound more like the uninspired cover versions churned out by faceless studio groups in the `60s than the high-octane output of the era's most famous instrumental soul combo. In contrast, Al Jackson kicks up sparks with his resonant tom-tom lead in to \\"The End,\\" Booker T and Steve Cropper cut winning solos on \\"Something,\\" and the four parts of \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" fits the four instrumentalists like a glove.<br /><br />Concord's reissue reproduces the original album cover - a Memphis-based pastiche of the original - and adds liner notes by Ashley Kahn. The album's original tracks are augmented by five additional Beatles covers drawn from the group's albums, all remastered in 24-bits by Joe Tarantino. Among the bonuses are an unreleased alternate take of \\"You Can't Do That\\" and an unlisted radio ad delivered as an \\"Her Majesty\\" like coda at the end of the last track. Interestingly, this was the next-to-last album recorded by the MGs for Stax, mirroring Abbey Road's place in the Beatles' recording history; but it was the group's terrific last LP, [[ASIN:B000000ZIK Melting Pot]], that was their own proper swan song. 3-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings.

0553386794|4.0|This was pretty good. Martin has an amazing gift for creating deeply realistic historical fantasy. The writing is good, though most of the action is described in passing or exposition in dialog, which some might fight a little dull. It more than makes up for this with strongly woven characters with complex personalities and relationships. Even the worst of them are identifiable, and the best of them have flaws and shortcoming that make them intimately human. It's easy to get lost in the words and imagine yourself a participant in the story, either as a bookish maester studying chronicles of a bygone era, the young son of a minor lord being told stories by a septon, or a freerider or mercenary collecting tales in a smoky tavern from old knights and veterans.<br /><br />If I hadn't known this was the first in a series, I may have been disappointed with the end. The conflict introduced early in the book is not quite resolved by the end...in fact, the events of this book appear to complicate it dramatically. It isn't until well into the book, quite a bit past the middle, and the conflict that is ultimately resolved in this volume of the series is resolved, and even then it leaves the reader hanging. This is good if you've decided to invest yourself in the whole series (as I have) but not if you're just looking for a single-shot read. The complications that arise to promise to keep the story moving into the rest of the series.<br /><br />Some of the character resolutions are a bit disappointing. I don't want to give anything away, but one of the most interesting characters in the book has a most unsatisfying resolution--though Martin kind of makes up for it in the end. Also, there is a relatively glaring plot-hangup that requires the reader to believe that a certain character in the book is too stupid to notice something DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF HIM in the years before (and the months including) this book. Martin manages to justify this by having the character in question be a womanizing, hedonistic drunkard...but at times it strains credulity that he wouldn't at some point look up and go, \\"Hey, waitaminute!\\"<br /><br />Nonetheless, this is a highly enjoyable read. My favorite character is the imp, Tyrion Lannister. He's really the only Lannister in the book that I didn't want to beat with a Dothraki whip. There are plenty of characters to love, and more than a few to love to hate. And the characters actions are believable and consistent without being predictable--usually. Plenty of betrayals, twisted oaths and backroom dealing to keep you guessing.<br /><br />All of this happens to the backdrop of some greater, more powerful danger lurking just outside the gate--or, the Wall as it were, as the noble houses and armies of the world play their \\"game of thrones,\\" oblivious to nightmare on the way. This is reminiscent of the squabbles of real-world powers while global problems like climate change and overpopulation threaten everyone with equal fervor.<br /><br />Overall, Martin has written a great book. The moment I finish writing this review, I intend to begin reading the second in the series. I'll let you know what I think when I'm done with it.<br />--StPedonistic drunkard...but at times it strains credulity that he wouldn't at some point look up and go, \\"Hey, waitaminute!\\"    Nonetheless, this is a highly enjoyable read.

B001LF347E|5.0|As this show has gone on, I have only come to love it more and more. The depth of the characters increases, the humour becomes more sophisticated, and the intensity of what's happening goes up. The plot becomes more involved as well. It's really great fun, and the characters are brilliant. The scripting is incredibly well done. Colin Morgan plays the young Merlin, a manservant to Prince Arthur (Bradley James) in a Camelot ruled by King Uther (Anthony Stewart Head of Buffy) where magic is forbidden on pain of death. Thus, Merlin must save the prince from magical enemies, all while pretending to be the bumbling servant. The banter between Arthur and Merlin is amazingly good fun, and their burgeoning friendship is really sweet.   The first season itself doesn't have the gel that I would like, but as the season goes on, all of the characters do begin to come together like a well-oiled machine, and everything falls into its niche. Not to say that the season is bad, it's far from that--it's very entertaining, but keep in mind it only gets better from the first season!  And I hope that's a glowing-enough review to send you off to watch it!    Keep in mind, Arthurian legend purists, that this is really not accurate in many ways. The writers and actors have admitted that they're not keeping strictly to legend. And you obviously see that. But it's quite good, very worthwhile, and a lot of fun to watch. I laugh. I cry. I fist-pump my approval.
B004LFO0ME|1.0|Just let me tell you that this album deals with bad influences, especially when you see the clip \\"Black and white\\". You can see satanic hand signs and Baphomet T-shirt on it. Very big lack of identity. Keep your eyes open! Big labels make stars buying their souls with materialistic messages. In America if you wanna go rich with hip-hop, you have to face the devil and get the dollars from bad white collars masons. Go ask Killah Priest !
B000002HAJ|5.0|Wish is a fantastic album with layers of beautiful guitars, guitars, guitars. (and more guitars) Conceptually fascinating from the organic cover art to the last note of the song \\"End,\\" Wish signified, or at least arrived at, the end of an era in modern music, but stands on its own as a creative, moody but accessible musical journey. Pop songs share album space with longer, moodier pieces. Great melodies, lead guitar lines, bass work and percussion of all sorts. One of my favorite albums. There are days when I like Wish even better than Disintegration.    Notes:   - More than any other album I can think of, the cover art of Wish matches the \\"color\\" of the music with an eerie, dreamlike quality.     - I think Wish was the last album where Robert Smith's lyrics were truly poetic and deeply moving.     - From my vantage point this is Robert Smith's first album as a full grown adult. (Yes, I know, he was in his 30s.) But even Smith has stated in interviews that he felt much different writing this album than others. For example, he stopped using the word \\"boy\\" and used \\"man\\" instead. A notable example given by RS is the song Wendy Time where the lyric is \\"...like the last man on earth.\\"    Disintegration, on the other hand, while clearly a deeply emotional album, always struck me as Smith cleverly writing from the perspective of a boy observing dysfunctional grownups. What I mean is that for a fellow in his late 30's to write a song like \\"Disintegration\\" would take a lot of life experience that RS perhaps didn't have yet, and I suspected the song might be about a blend of personal relationships but also adult relationships he was observing to fall apart. Disintegration sounds like a forty-something guy walking out on his family. Wish, though, has a different feel to it. Clearly it his all his own experience.     - Something in the songs seems to sense the end was near for that lineup of the band and for the changing of an era. The World Wide Web arrived during the '92-93tour, grunge rock burst onto the scene, etc. What a fantastic time to attend concerts!
031603441X|5.0|Could it be that even given the hundreds of classics I've read in my lifetime that a rock n' roll bio by a guy in a band I don't even like could be one of the best books I've ever read?!?    While I'm not a Stones fan (more of a Beatles guy myself), I respect their music and their place in the pantheon of greats (it's really Jagger that rubs me wrong...and apparently he has the same affect on the author as well!) this book still offered me enough that I could not only appreciate the musicianship involved but take a new found respect for the band as a whole.    'Life' is not a rock bio of the Rolling Stones.  It gives detailed recording information of the early years and then later only drops in details that highlight the changing times.  If you're a diehard Stones fan and looking for detailed descriptions of recording/writing sessions etc, you'll find only the highlights here.  This is very much a biography of one of rock's great guitarists and characters, not the band he made his mark with.    Guitar techies will eat up the early chapters detailing open chord tuning and the progression of the Stones sound, while casual fans and readers will revel in the sordid drug years as well as the sentimental details of Richards' private life with his family.    An absolute MUST read for any music fan of any genre.  This replaces \\"Hammer of the Gods\\" and \\"No one Here Gets Out Alive\\" as required school of rock reading.
B000025H0Q|5.0|\\"Bryter Layter\\" by Nick Drake is from 1970, which is already more than 40 years ago. As a folk-pop record it is peerless, as an encapsulation of the era it is second to none, and as an alternative album it ranks among some of the best works by Rufus Wainwright or even Joanna Newsom. As with every record of such staggering worth, it was a colossal disaster upon first release, eventually sending its' maker into a downward spiral from which he never fully recovered. Let me preface this review that if this album has any one direct comparison, it would be \\"Parallelograms\\" by Linda Perhacs (another obscure and forgotten gem of a record).<br /><br />I would rank Nick Drake as the Jeff Buckley of his generation, as it takes the boy and a guitar idiom and transposes it decades before Buckley. Drake is also rather comparable to Tim Buckley (Jeff's father), but while Tim has a more neo-folk, whimsical touch to his albums, Drake is firmly planted in the acoustic-folk & jazz genre - although some songs here are so stripped down that you would be hard-pressed to fit them into any genre other than `melancholy'. What makes this album special, even within Drake's own small discography, is that it was recorded with some very alluring musicians of the time - Fairport Convention and John Cale from The Velvet Underground, as well as Beach Boys musicians Mike Kowalski and Ed Carter. All of them bring just the right amount of talent to the table, and are more than willing to play second fiddle to the lead instrument here - which would be Nick Drake's voice. It isn't a very strong voice, and there isn't a single song of his (on all his three albums) where he displays any soaring notes or stretches his vocal abilities, but he has a warm, cozy quality to his voice, akin to curling up in a corner with a really good old book. I suppose this is one reason Drake appeals to such diverse yet niche audiences. This is very much a `home' record, and is best experienced solitary.<br /><br />It must be remembered that Drake made this record with the intent that it would be a departure from his first album \\"Five Leaves Left\\", which had flopped considerably. The jazz elements were brought in, in a move to edge away from the more pastoral elements of the first record. This was in 1970, and it was also the infamous year in which Drake attempted to play live concerts, all of which went badly, as he didn't believe in communicating with his audience; and spent inordinate time between songs tuning his guitar. However, Drake's interest in this album was primarily to make an impact on the marketplace, something that had eluded him with his first released; and even John Cale, who contributed backing vocals, was sure of the records success. Much to Drake's horror, \\"Bryter Later\\" was released with little promotion and went on to sell only slightly less than 2500 copies. It would mark the beginning of Drake's descent into further depression, one from which he never fully recovered.<br /><br />Forty something years later, \\"Bryter Later\\" has received much acclaim, partly because of the renewed interest in Drake in the `90s and `00s, but also because somehow, this album has aged beautifully. Its certainly a record that gets better with time; and songs from it that I first heard in the mid `90s sound almost radically different now; and seem to burst with far more life than I had imagined. I thought this to be an anomaly, so I went back and listened to his debut record, but it didn't sparkle with the it-factor that this album does. What adds to its appeal, is that the production is impeccable and very considerate towards the underlying rule that Drake's voice is the true star of the album; and never do the instruments overpower his voice. On most tracks, all we get is Drake's pristine vocal, clean and clear, in super clarity. Its almost disconcerting that something of such power could have gone overlooked at the time of its' release, because even compared to the other `folk' records of 1970, it is markedly different in almost all aspects.<br /><br />\\"Bryter Layter\\" opens with \\"Introduction\\" and closes with \\"Sunday\\", both instrumental pieces that act as Prologue and Epilogue. The first true track of the album is \\"Hazey Jane II\\"; followed by the splendid \\"At the chime of a city clock\\", where he can rightfully be compared to Tim Buckley. Note that if you are interested in a male voice with a lot of gusto or power to it, this is not the place to be looking for it. Drake has often come under criticism for being a weak vocalist who appeared to `talk' over his songs. This is in part true. In truth, his delivery is mixture of singing and talking, and his intonation isn't exactly conducive to a real vocalist. Despite this, there is a certain warmth and magic to his voice; like an old friend; that will keep you coming back to certain tracks to relive them repeatedly. At the time however, I suppose his vocal skills weren't considered praiseworthy, considering he was up against some big names back in the day. Drake released only three `proper' albums during his lifetime, and this is undoubtedly the best of them. If one had to choose a `best' track, it would be \\"Fly\\" and \\"Poor Boy\\" (where Nick really goes outside his comfort zone in many ways; plus also check out those stunning background vocalists and their harmonizing) and the closer \\"Sunday\\" (a beguiling instrumental). On his next album, \\"Pink Moon\\", Drake would strip down even further to just his voice and a guitar (it was recorded in just two days, and it sort of shows). While all of Drake's works can be considered vital, I would recommend \\"Bryter Layter\\" and his debut CD as the most immediate purchases. If you like this, you can then venture to some of his other work, such as the later compilation \\"Family Tree\\", that feature songs recorded even before his debut, with vocals by him, his sister, and his mother (though it isn't as consistently listenable as this record).<br /><br />This record deserves a vital place in any serious music lovers' collection; and especially for listeners who rank Vashti Bunyan, Meg Baird, Andrew Bird, Tim Buckley & Jeff Buckley highly. As a forgotten gem from the 1970s, it should finally come to possess the recognition it so richly deserved upon first release.<br /><br />Five Stars.y different in almost all aspects.    \\"Bryter Layter\\" opens with \\"Introduction\\" and closes with \\"Sunday\\", both instrumental pieces that act as Prologue and Epilogue.

B0042816YK|5.0|Im so SHocked by the negative reviews. Now this movie may not satisfy those looking for some crazy scenes of wild action, violence and r rated sex that seems to be the desired film content for the simple of mind, but it was the perfect movie of peace and self direction. The scenery was beautiful and the casting was great. You leave this movie feeling like you can breathe a little easier. I guess people dont like movies with a point anymore...or ones about self discovery, self creation and finding out who you are beneath the surface. I bought this and watch it every time my life gets a little tougher. I really liked this movie and what it had to offer...i hope you do too.

B000JLSLZQ|2.0|Well, this wasn't the first 10 bucks I wasted, and it wont be the last.<br />Just a poorly done movie of a classic operetta. The sets, scenery, and morphing of scene to scene got so annoying, I had to watch in two parts.<br />The only voice that was excellent, was the dubbed in voice of Carlotta. It took me a while to find out who owned that glorious voice.<br />It belonged to Margaret Preece.<br />Listening to her was worth the 10 dollars.<br />Sometimes, you can ruin a masterpiece by trying to outsmart the genius behind the masterpiece.<br />Maybe they decided to put loads of ketchup on top of a filet mignon to cover the weak and poor singing talents cast into this production; trying to cover it with hideous scenery and morphing!<br />Too bad!<br />Thank you,<br />Fred Auerbach
0553582038|1.0|There are some things that Mr. Martin does well. Song of Ice and Fire started out with strong world building and interesting and engaging characters. However, it slowly falls apart. This volume, in particular, really drags.    It's important to know in this series there is a lot of violence, rape, and death, all graphically (almost pornographically) described. While labeled as \\"fantasy\\" it reads like horror, and the characters are slowly picked off one by one.    What is really disappointing as the series goes on, is the constant introduction of new characters and new plot points, with a severe lack of wrapping up previous plot points. At some point in the story, the mysteries need to be addressed and brought together. The series can't continue adding more mysteries and knocking off all the interesting characters forever. When a book series jumps from a planned 3 to 7 books, certainly it makes you question why.    While some of the characters are very interesting and engaging, women do not fair well. The women, up to this point, fall under standard archetypes. The mother. The whore. The evil queen. The witch. The princess. The tomboy. The shield maiden.

Lots and lots and lots of different radio stations to choose from; local and worldwide.  Also has podcast feeds, etc.  The app responds fast to commands.  I have been using now for over four months and seriously have no negative things to say.  The Pro version lets you record from feeds...which could be super useful for some.  All in all a great app!!!

When I play Gary Moores' Blues Music, my girlfriend becomes upset at me when I play the CD \\"Still Got the Blues\\", I smile. I listen and dance to the rhythm, she listens, she becomes irritated by the lyrics. Talking about \\"head banging music!\\". I love it.    P.S.- I saw, on another music web-site, where they were selling this CD at a price of $110 per copy of the CD. HUMMM! Was that a typo?
0345522478|5.0|Holy crap, but did I love this book! Druids! Witches! Gods! Werewolves! Vampires! Irish wolfhounds! Widows! Throw all these things together, and what you have is an entirely romping fun adventure of a book.    Atticus O'Sullivan may look 21, but in reality he's 21 centuries old and the last Druid. And when you're that old, you're bound to make some enemies along the way. You see, Atticus is in possession of a sword that he \\"stole\\" from the Tuatha Dé Danann almost 2000 years ago, and some of those gods want the sword back. Unfortunately for Atticus, one of these ancient gods has made it his personal vendetta against Atticus and has chased him for centuries. And Atticus has run for centuries. But maybe it's time for Atticus to stop running and face his pursuer. However, even Atticus knows it's not a good idea to take on a god by yourself, so he calls in help from some other gods, his vampire/werewolf tag team of attorneys, a bartender who is possessed by a centuries old witch and his faithful Irish wolfhound, Oberon. But even this mixed bag of heroes may not be enough to take down a Celtic love god who has allied himself with Hell and a coven of witches.    I thoroughly enjoyed this book from the moment I picked it up. Hearne's writing is so natural that it picks you right up in the story and sweeps you along. The world building in Hounded isn't too challenging - the entire story takes place in Tempe, AZ - but it's the way that Hearne utilizes gods from several pantheons to create a varied way that religion works in his world. I think this is a really unique approach to gods and Hearne uses it well. Don't let this intimidate you, though. Hearne explains who everybody is and doesn't leave you hanging on trying to figure out who is who.    The writing is fast-paced but doesn't seem to want to try to get ahead of itself. I've noticed this in books I've read before like this, that the story tries to move itself along almost too quickly, not giving you a chance to keep upwith it. That's not the case here; Hearne keeps his story moving but without rushing you through it. His entire cast of characters are funny and witty, but not overly so. I found myself laughing out loud through several portions of the book, and especially at Oberon, Atticus' Irish wolfhound. I think that Oberon may be my favorite character in the book. His take on the world and what is happening around him from a smarter-than-your-average dog point of view is often hysterical.    I could gush on some more about the book, but really, you just have to read it to really appreciate just how much fun it is. Fans of Jim Butcher's The Dresden Files will definitely want to pick this series up, but anybody who enjoys a funny, clever urban fantasy will really enjoy this book. Highly recommended!
B004L49K20|5.0|I was 21 when MTV happened and Duran Duran hit in the US. I've followed them thru highs and lows. I've loved them and not so much.

God, I love this CD!

And so goes the book as it outlines the six major concepts for making an idea stick with an audience, a customer or anyone. The applications are endless for teachers, business people or parents. Well worth understanding the concepts. As with most well written books, you can find a summary of the ideas at the end, good for those that may not have the time for a full read.
B003XDUCIG|4.0|There are people in this world, often called \\"geeks\\", who consider vocations like writing operating systems and building robots to be fun, interesting pastimes. And there is a subset of this group - two of my closest friends among them - for whom even the thought of making a meal from scratch produces doubt, uncertainty, and fear. This book was written (or sent from heaven) especially for them.<br /><br />Reading more like a textbook than a cookbook (and appealing to those of us who read textbooks for fun), [[ASIN:0596805888 Cooking for Geeks: Real Science, Great Hacks, and Good Food]] presents the culinary arts as the hard sciences that they truly are. The terrified new cook is given brief lessons in kitchen equipment and food safety, then turned loose with the instruction, \\"Have fun, you can always order pizza!\\"<br /><br />Like most good O'Reilly programming manuals, very simple programs (in this case, recipes for cocoa and pancakes) are presented at the start; experimentation is constantly encouraged while complexity is gradually - and artfully - increased. One wonders if the dutiful student will even recognize molecular gastronomy as difficult by the time he or she reaches chapter six.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0596805888 Cooking for Geeks]] would make a great gift for college-bound kids (especially chemistry and physics majors), fans of TV shows like [[ASIN:B002W3AKTO Mythbusters]] or [[ASIN:1584797959 Good Eats]], and any of the aforementioned geeks who need help weaning themselves off breakfast cereal and ramen noodles. I highly recommend the paperback (which I purchased) over the electronic edition (given to me for review) as I am not completely comfortable using a laptop or tablet around boiling water... and isn't getting out of the computer room and into the kitchen entirely the point of this book?

First batch turned out, but after this I realize just how many little things I could have done better.  This book is a good introduction for the beginning brewer or would be a good review for intermediates as well.  It is a quick read, took me about a week of reading an hour or two at night.    It starts out with how to brew your first batch correctly, then builds in layers of complexity until by the end, you understand the basics of how to brew a batch with grain and why we do the things we do. Overall excellent book and I would recommend to anyone getting into brewing.

This book is not for the faint of heart, and really does read at a high level.  There are several chapters that get into fairly high level philosophical concepts and some background would be helpful to really enjoy the book.  It is hard for me to believe sometimes that this book was written in 1974, because it seems probably truer today than it was at that time.

I literally could not stop reading them once I started, so you can imagine how excited I was for Mockingjay. I could not have been more disappointed. It feels like maybe the publisher didn't want to have a four book series, because everything feels very rushed and untidy. the pacing is entirely off, with no tension being built up and characters being randomly killed off, because, i don't know, they were in the way? This is sort of like reading a playthrough of Dynasty Warriors; It's just a pain in the ass and really just not enjoyable.

I particularly liked the \\"Fair Melusine\\" overture, partly because Mendelssohn wrote it in a fit of pique brought on by seeing a bad production of the play, but also because of the water figures which very much evoke the Rhine leitmotif in \\"The Ring of the Niebelungen,\\" years before Wagner wrote \\"Das Rhinegold.\\"  Hmmm.  Buy.  Listen.  Enjoy.    Sharon Goldstein, writing from Los Angeles

0670022411|5.0|I thought this was a great book overall and I'm very happy with the writing and the characters. I did agree that it was slow at times, but I enjoyed all the story building, history, science, magic, etc. I also liked that the characters had their flaws and were not made out to be perfect.    I will definitely be reading the remaining books when they come out!
0553805371|3.0|The title of the book, \\"The Grand Design\\", belies the actual content between the covers. This work is an elementary description of current cosmologic thought on the origins of the universe in terms readily understandable by most layman. However, Hawkings and Mlodinow seem to make this their holy grail quest to disprove the existence of God. The proof of God is a philosophic argument without direct observations available for comment by the scientific community. The same can be said for the M-theory. As the authors point out, the \\"theory\\" has yet to be confirmed by observations. The history of the development of this theory is nicely laid out by the authors, making note of the fact that it requires \\"renormalization\\" to make the possible answers fit the observations. This is what is otherwise known as fudging. The lack of direct observations, required by scientific determinism rather than faith, seems to pose no problem to the authors in having the world accept M-theory as the equation describing the \\"Grand Design\\". The authors attempt to solve the greatest philosophic question of the universe by having the readers believe mathematics is the universal truth rather than being a means to an end. This is the crux of the problem with this work. As Fodor and Palmarini pointed out in their book, \\"What Darwin Got Wrong\\", it is not that the science behind the apparent evidence is wrong, but that the conclusions drawn from those observations are misinterpreted and misapplied. I would have enjoyed the book more if it had dealt more with the history and science of cosmology, rather than the philosophic conclusions drawn from the lack of direct observation supporting a theory in need of physical proof.
0679805273|5.0|My mother gave me this book when I finished my Ph.D. degree.  I fell in love with the book, and often give it as a graduation present because it is so inspirational for all ages.  Some of my fondest childhood memories are those spent with my grandmother, reading \\"The Cat in the Hat\\" to her when I was in the first grade. Somehow it seems fitting that when I finished my final academic degree, Dr. Seuss would be there too.  The message of Dr. Seuss lives on, and crosses many generations.  \\"The Places You'll Go\\" is inspirational for graduates, from grade school to grad school, and many life transitions in between.
B00454U1NS|5.0|I enjoy every single song on this CD. I hadn't even heard all the songs initially when I purchased it. I am really enjoying it.
B002IYEQR4|4.0|The Film: ***** 5 Stars. What can be said that hasn't already. Despite several director's (in this case Zach Snyder) hubris in wanting to turn comics/literature into films, Zach Snyder succeeds in this outing. Complete, finally, with the Black Freighter added back in (and serves the overall story of both, much better). Despite changing some details with the finale' (not the plot but the mechanism for it)it can be said in confidence that the choice serves the story better, if not as psychologically logical or powerful. Overall, I enjoyed the film and read the Graphic Novel again immediately after and this did not deter from my liking the \\"Ultimate Cut\\" of the film. Faithful to the core story and visually a treat. A mature, cynical story about human nature and I loved every minute of it.    The Blu-Ray packaging/presentation: **** 4 Stars. Nice, attractive set in a sturdy fold-out box. Too many discs for a Blu-Ray however.    Marketing: ** 2 Stars. The Blu-Ray itself and the special features within are great and no complaints regarding this specifically. My criticism stems from the way the Watchmen was marketed on Home Video, in general. This supposed four disc collection, really doesn't extend beyond the two Blu-Rays (one being the film and the other, special features). The other two discs are the digital copy of the theatrical release (which, if you don't like invasive software from WB, is useless) and the Motion Comic (the actual, previously released motion comic). Now, please don't misunderstand, I knew what I was getting into and I feel others looking for this definitive version do to. It is overall frustration that it was released and marketed in three different versions. The Director's Cut and Ultimate cut, released, worded and presented in ambiguous ways to confuse us into buying both (and, no, I didn't buy both, just this one). I guess this is a criticism of the industry regarding a perceived Home Video hot commodity. With Blu-Ray technology, why do we have to suffer so many of these multi-disc versions and cuts of films? When will the industry learn? Give us WHAT we want and we will buy it. Not SOME of what we want. The various Watchmen versions out there are a testament to my argument; Theatrical and Directors Cuts (and various other DVDs/Blu-Rays) are all around $10 or less, still new from vendors, the Ultimate Cut DVD and Blu-Ray are currently available only on the Secondary Market and the Blu-Ray is going for high prices. Hmm. Well, at least the current trend is to include both a Blu-Ray and DVD copy in current Blu-Ray discs, so maybe they are learning.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Lady Gaga is truly an inspiration, and a pop icon!  I'm happy with The Fame Monster [Deluxe Edition], because, not only is it The Fame Monster, but it includes The Fame.  It's two for the price of one!  And the music is truly amazing.  It's got good lyrics and music, and it's definitely something that you can move your hips to.  To Lady Gaga, I'd probably say keep up the good work, and I'm looking forward to hearing great things on \\"Born This Way\\" on May 23rd and future albums to come. Buy \\"Born This Way\\" on May 23rd, or pre-order it now!  [[ASIN:B004K4AVAG Born This Way]]  [[ASIN:B004K4AUZW Born This Way (Special Edition)]]
0307887960|2.0|May 22: Revision of view: After 2 1/2 weeks on the diet without one single slip up, I lost a total of 8 pounds; only 3 more than the first 5 days. Even with the addition of psyllium husks, flax seed, and the oat bran, constipation is still an issue. Colon health is vital and I am not sure this diet is the answer for me.     Our bodies also need a certain amount of good fats which are absent in the Dukan Diet. Maybe a combination of Atkins/Dukan would be better since Atkins does allow beneficial, and yes I know, some not so good fats. Atkins also includes more vegetables and you can have them every day, not just every other day.     I imagine that a lot of people give up on Dukan when they start feeling like they are getting the flu or a cold. That is a Herxheimer's reaction which is really a good thing. Means that your body is getting rid of yeast overgrowth (candida). It quickly goes away leaving you a lot better off.     Think I will go back to Doug Kaufmann's diet ([...]) which is much healthier for you overall.     Earlier post: With most of the book read, I will have to say that even though the copyright is 2011, advice is still over 10 years old. Dr. D's recommendation to use aspartame or Splenda and use diet sodas is now absurd. Speaking as a former diet soda \\"junkie\\", diet sodas are so very harmful to your health. Aspartame has received more complaints to the FDA than almost anything. Didja know that \\"The last component of aspartame is methanol, better known as wood alcohol, a \\"deadly poison,\\" claims Dr. Roberts. The Environmental Protection Agency recommends less than eight milligrams per day of methanol. A typical liter of an aspartame diet soda contains approximately 55 milligrams. Complications of methanol poisoning include blindness, brain swelling, pancreatitis, numbness, shooting pains, cardiac changes, and death (28, 42-45). According to Aspartame Consumer Safety Network, when ingested, methanol breaks down into formaldehyde, \\"known to cause cancer,accumulating slowly without detection in the body\\" (The Deadly Deception 2).\\" (drmercola.com)      Consuming this much animal protein leads to concerns about conventional meats, fish, dairy, and poultry:    *Eat grass fed beef that has no antibiotics, meat glue (look this up), hormones, or other nasty stuff.   *Don't eat farm raised fish that are full of antibiotics and other yucky things.   *Eat only antibiotic free chicken and organic eggs  *Try organic veggies for the most part.   *Eat organic plain non-fat yogurt, not the junk with the fruit added and not the vanilla either cause it has sugar added.   *Try to use organic veggies to eliminate the pesticides. Look up a list of the dirty dozen must buy organic foods at [...].   *Do not eat corn or corn products. The are genetically modified and will \\"genetically modify\\" you. Same with soy. Make sure the label on soy products says \\"GMO Free).     Overconsumption of conventionally grown veggies and animal products will overload your system with toxins. So be very, very careful.     The diet is working for me as I have lost 5 pounds in 5 days. I only use stevia for a sweetener and only use herbal or green tea. I plan to remain on this for another 20 pound loss but will do it with the modifications mentioned above so that I am safe.   So, will you lose weight on this diet? Yes! But use your 2011 common sense.
B004HGBUVG|5.0|While I ordinarily don't review my music purchases on Amazon I felt compelled  to review \\"Blessed\\" by Lucinda Williams after reading a few not so flattering reviews on the Amazon website. \\"Blessed\\" is simply a work of art. The songs are  some of her best written yet.  The producer, Don Was, has kept Lucinda's vocal style reigned in and the result is pure magic.  Every song is a winner and the album becomes quite addictive with repeated listenings.  I am constantly amazed that with each listening I have all new favorites.  This album IS hypnotic, but in a subtle yet sensual way. I have all of Lucinda's albums and \\"Blessed\\" is my favorite.  I would love to hear Patti Smith do a cover of \\"The Awakening\\".  Thank you Lucinda for your precious gift of \\"Blessed.\\"
630542845X|3.0|I loved this movie as a kid, but I'm not sure it aged well. I enjoyed watching it again, but mostly just for the nostalgia. My fiancee had never seen it, and she thought it was pretty dumb. I would say it's worth watching, but if you don't like movies about albinos with super powers, this is probably not the movie for you.
B002ZG99QS|4.0|i would have given this film a 5 star rating ....but i feel the special effects crew did not make the cut with the graphic representations of the characters: clu and tron in their effort to bridge the time gap for the present day characters' younger selves.... i loved the movie personally...but i think many could have viewed \\"Tron:legacy\\" as a low buget video game in some of it's cinematic aspects....
B000BKVQTS|4.0|I was raised in Germany, so I was fairly familiar with all of the Grimm's stories. This movie does a great job putting those stories together into a single plot. Ledger and Damon are great in this, although it seems like an odd role for Matt Damon. I would say the movie is not overly scary or brilliant, but it is well done and certainly worth watching. I've seen it a few times and love it.
B004Q1FDHO|3.0|I love the game very addicting. Now if it would work for more then five minutes without freezing and forcing my whole phone to restart I would say it is one of my favorite games on here. Samsung Epic 4G 2.2.1
B003G8WI7G|5.0|Just days ago, I watched Trombone Shorty & Orleans Avenue steal a crowd right out from under big-city headliners The Strokes at the New Orleans Jazz Fest. Where The Strokes were determined to coast by on ironic detachment, Troy Andrews delivered exactly what the crowd wanted: hooks, grooves, fresh ideas, and historical shout-outs, all baked in the Big Easy's proud tradition of brassy jazz.    I was immediately a fan.    The next day I found this CD, and was ecstatic to hear the same mix of energetic brass and modern styles. Only 25, Trombone Shorty has already been playing for around two decades, and it's clear he's got ability. But there's a jazz prodigy in every big-city high school. What's exciting here is that Andrews freshens up his jazz background without getting gimmicky.     He shows his commitment to brass right out of the gate with screaming trumpets over tubas and bones on \\"Hurricane Season.\\" It's a reassuring gesture. Later songs like \\"Something Beautiful\\" and \\"Right to Complain\\", have Andrews leaning more on R&B-flavored vocals than funky brass, and your interest in these departures will likely foreshadow your take on the album as a whole. Personally, I think the experiments work, giving the album plenty of range without feeling indulgent. I'm interested to see whether future releases can manage the same balance. New Orleans is a city in love with its deep roots, and given that Shorty is a born-and-raised local, I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.    All in all, a great introduction, and one that leaves me wanting more!
B002QW7AJY|4.0|Ben Foster is so good in everything he does, though I still think of him as Claire's boyfriend from Six Feet Under. Anyway, I am a hardcore science fiction fan. My two all time favorite movies are Blade Runner and Alien. Though it may not be a classic like either of those, it is one of the best genre films I've seen. I totally enjoyed it and felt like it was not something I'd seen before. Great visual style and Quaid and Foster are superb. Foster is on a par with Ryan Gosling in my opinion, as one of the best actors of their generation. Along with Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Well, I digress. Pandorum is greatly entertaining and everything I want to see in a science fiction film.
B0045HCJKS|4.0|The movie is just like I remember watching it when it first came out. At the time, it seemed high-tech, but in today's movie tech mania, it lacks the luster and movie magic FX. The movie's premise is thought-provoking and clever. What if you could do more at an amusement park than just ride through a pseudo, quasi-environment of your choice? \\"At Delos, you get your choice of the vacation you want. There's Medieval World, Roman World and, of course, Westworld.\\" What if the Matrix allowed you to actually become a part of the matrix? What if you could use real guns and kill robots that were completely indistinguishable from real people like the Matrix? In other words, how about a park where you can enter a fantasy world that for all intents and purposes is a real world? I enjoyed watching it again and now that I have it, I can watch it over and over in the comfort of my home. One young actor looks so much at times like Christian Bale does today. What are the chances... that's almost creepy. Also, a part I especially liked was the western garb the Yul Brynner wears à la Magnificent Seven. I won't revel the what he wears and the unusal look in his eyes. Rent or buy the film to find out.
0811879542|5.0|I read about this book and purchased a copy for our six-year-old granddaughter. She loved it so, she took it to her kindergarten show-and-tell. She was lucky to get the book back, so we purchased two more -- one for her class and one for a different grandchild. A great way to engage a child's imagination and increase appreciation for those things called \\"books.\\"    Lee Salem
B00065JTBA|5.0|I have been wanting this cd set for quite some time now after having been shown that it existed by my, \\"X's, boss's, wife, who is also a huge Bon Jovi fan, like me.  I was quite envious after reviewing it from beginning to end and hearing songs I've never gotten a chance to hear before!  However, I wasn't too envious of what her husband spent on it for her for Christmas; yes, they told us how much it was.  I figured I probably wouldn't be able to own it any time soon so I kind of just put it on my mind's \\"wish list\\" and waited.  Well, here I am several years later, searching for it on Amazon and Ebay and such and low and behold, I FOUND IT!!! Not only that but I got a really great deal on it and the seller got it to me in a timely manner and it was in the condition, as described.  So, as it turns out, NOW I'm really glad I waited...guess the saying is true, \\"Good things come to those who wait.\\"  Great album and some really beautiful songs!! A MUST for any Bon Jovi fan!  THANKS! Tonya :)
0321704452|1.0|I've been a fan of the Presentation Zen website for many years, and have read Garr's previous books. They were both excellent, and contained concrete advice on how to design effective presentations, especially using slides.<br /><br />This new book feels like a placeholder, with nothing much new to add to the topic. I found it a bit too repetitive, with the same advice repeated throughout the book. Many of the anecdotes, and much of the advice, comes in the form of quotes from other books in the \\"how to present\\" field. The rest is taken from the Presentation Zen website, where I'd already read it in blog form.<br /><br />I thought that the approach taken by Scott Berkun in \\"Confessions of a Public Speaker\\" was a better way to address this topic. Unfortunately, this book was a let-down to me.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|When I purchased the CD, I was impressed, which is tough to do, as I only listen to metal, and sub-genres of it. The songs have a lot of range in genre, and listening to it feels like a combination of those few artists out there I enjoy, Imogen Heap, The Yeah Yeah Yeah's etc. It's definitely worth picking up.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|good app but its been on the same 2 levels since day 1. needs a update please! im just bored with it now.
B0015DROBO|1.0|All of the hype for this book - I purchased it on my kindle and got about 4% into it.... wish I could return it.  I can't go any further.  I just don't see the appeal....
0425188809|5.0|This was my first Koontz book to read it was suggested to me by my mother, and I fell in love with this book, I have read it so many times, that I will have to by another book because mine is falling apart.
B003JFJHVQ|5.0|Despite its brevity, The Dying Animal is a masterpiece in its own right. Searingly honest, painfully revelatory, and consistently entertaining. Kepesh's doomed infatuation with his student, the cool and rational analysis with which he deconstructs his own irrationality, is vintage Roth. A great book. I'm rereading it now, years later, and I'm even more impressed.
B002VKE1K2|4.0|At a time when horror films are mostly mindless exercises in stomach-churning gore, it's nice to see a little indie film that leaves the real chills up to your imagination.  By using their budget limitations to give the film its documentary feel, the filmmakers have actually given their film a realistic feel.<br /><br />The couple does a good job of making their acting look like non-acting.  The script is clever enough to slowly amp up the tension through escalating little effects.  The sound of footsteps, objects moving, doors slamming.  More effort is spent watching dark hallways and floors than most horror films engage their audiences.<br /><br />I have a feeling that most of the negative reviews here are from horror fans who expect a lot of grotesque violence in their movies.  PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is a clever film that does so much more: it looks into the dark, knows there's something evil there...and then leaves it to the worst thing it can to consider this horror: our imagination.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I know, I'm on the Up bandwagon a little late. I just watched this movie and it was very emotional for a \\"kids\\" movie. It deals with a lot of issues - loss of a loved one, uninterested parents/abandonment issues, greed/anger and then ends with love. What a great message this movie has throughout it. Although it definitely evoked more tears than I anticipated!
B000YDDUJQ|5.0|not SACD/SHM stars...music=5...recording=1...if your searching for a real remaster...this insn't it...bit rates are well below pre and post albums...which bugs me...considering the iconic value of this music...i guess the record company needs to milk eagles fans another round before releasing the real deal...and when they do...no doubt it will be a deluxe 2disc price gouge with lesser recordings on the second half...hope to be proven wrong  guess i need to acquire the shm or sacd version? but i wont be buying on amazon as the vendors of the SHM want 2x advertised on ebay!
B0029LHW4U|4.0|It took me two long years to convince myself that this is not treason!  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE what is now known as the old-AIC and I especially prefer and adore the original lineup featuring Layne Staley and Mike Starr.  Dirt and Facelift were true masterpieces that just cannot be touched.  I just couldn't find it in myself to accept this new album because I thought there was simply no way that AIC could be good without Layne.  I was proved wrong.  No, it's not as good as when Layne was still here, but it is truly a terrific album.  Considering the total crap music out there now-a-days, it was so refreshing to get this CD and hear this great music again.  The first time I listened to the CD, I liked it but by the second time, I REALLY loved it.  I highly recommend to any Alice in Chains fan!  You won't regret purchasing it.      Oh, the only reason for four stars is because nothing can be five stars by Alice in Chains without the magnificent Layne Staley or Mike Starr.
1423389387|5.0|I thought this book was every bit as good as the first one. I'm not going to spend my time trying to give a recap of a book that clocks in at 1 k pages and takes over 40 hours to listen to on CD.  I thought this volume might have been a bit more \\"scatter shot\\" than the first, but it is a middle volume and those by their nature leave me feeling like I didn't quite finish the book.<br /><br />Because I listened to this book, as opposed to reading it, it also had a different feel from the first. Suffice it to say that Nick Podehl's reading is great and adds to the compelling nature of the story. If you suffer from a short attention span then do not read/listen to these books. Lots of action and characters and you will need to pay attention to what is going on (much like some of the other \\"meatier\\" works out on the market these days).<br /><br />This book was quite a while in the making but, in my opinion, well worth waiting for.
1582701709|5.0|Company has excellent business practice and received the book in a very timely manner.    A Must Read. You will not regret it.
0765348276|5.0|I thought this book started off really slowly. In fact, I found the first twenty or thirty pages read like lunch-time at the local cafeteria. I was reading the dialog in the early section and turned to the front to see the publication date. When I saw 2005 I was shocked-- it seemed like something written in the 1950s. This all makes sense when you realize the protagonist and his crew are geriatrics.<br /><br />The pace and dialog take a completely different turn when the oldsters hit their strides in their \\"new\\" bodies in the Colonial Defense Force.<br /><br />I absolutely LOVED the boot camp section and thought the drill sergeant was as good, if not better, than the famous character from Full Metal Jacket.<br /><br />My only complaint about this book? IT NEEDS TO BE LONGER! I was just getting to the obsessive-can't-stop-reading-and-go-to-bed stage and it was over!<br /><br />Incidentally, something about this book reminds me of the famous series by Glen Cook, The Black Company. It's more than just the fact that it is military fantasy, there is also something in the writing that reminds me of the convincing camaraderie Glen Cook conveys so well.<br /><br />I can't wait 'til I get my hands on the second book in this series.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Like others have said the search is limited, but my main use is when I'm in the store and I just want to compare prices.  This is where the scanning feature of the app really shines.  I came from the iphone, and previously you had to take a picture of the barcode and hope that it would process the picture correctly.  The app on android, is like a real scanner.. no need to take a picture, just line up the barcode and it beeps when it scans it.

There is something in this movie for everyone.  Young or old, I think everyone will find this movie fun and enjoyable.  It will make a great edition to a collection of Disney movies!
B004QPOVF0|3.0|I saw ACDC three different times on their Black Ice tour and there would've been a fourth time but due to an ice storm I was unable to attend (Black Ice, yeah I know). Anyways regarding this DVD it was a pleasure to have a commemorative DVD for this tour and maybe their last, but once again there seems to be too much crowd scenes and not enough of JUST some ACDC on stage playing their arses off! I felt too bombarded every 4-5 seconds with a scene change, whether it be from band member to band member or from band member to crazy crowd. I wish they would've made it an option to be able to watch the DVD without so much of the crowd. If you saw them on this tour you will also see how they chopped up the animated beginning quite a bit and to me that was a shame because that really set the tone of the show. Whatever happened to music DVD's that concentrated on the group more than the crowd?    With all this being said, and I know I've been hard on this DVD, I'd go see ACDC again in a heartbeat! I hope they do come out with something new soon and tour again!
B000286S8S|2.0|In 1996, Van Halen released their first \\"Best Of..\\" collection, which was only one disc and left many holes in the band's catalogue. Then in 2004, Van Halen gave it a second attempt with BEST OF BOTH WORLDS, a two-disc set which expands the track listing, but has more cons than pros. Instead of releasing a \\"Best Of Vol. 2,\\" they choose to recycle all of the previous songs from Vol 1 and expand on that. The result is more variety, and the DIVER DOWN album is finally represented, although the FAIR WARNING album still only has \\"Unchained\\" as its sole representation. The thirty-six track capacity is a great improvement, but that is where the improvement ends.     First off, the songs are not in chronological order, which misrepresents the band's evolution. The discs are also not segregated in the way that was anticipated; the tracks skip from a Roth song to a Hagar song. I would not mind this so much, but when you go from the hard-rocking \\"Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love\\" to the country-licking \\"Finish What Ya Started,\\" it just annoys someone who is a fan of either singer and wants to hear a streak from that singer's era. We also have the three new cuts, which were written specifically for the album. I understand that this is a marketing tactic that management uses to encourage sales, but these songs are trash. Van Halen is a better band than this, and more space could have been saved. I actually heard Hagar sing them in concert in 2004 and I knew right away where they came from!     Also, why the live tracks? Live songs belong on LIVE ALBUMS; not greatest hits collections. To make matters worse, these songs feature Hagar singing Roth tracks. I am not sure if this was an insult to Diamond Dave, or to further emphasize the title of this release. I am leaning more toward the former. Not to bash Sammy Hagar, but I have always preferred Roth, and do not understand why his material is being tampered with.    So Van Halen gave it a second shot at a greatest hits package, and came upvery flat. There are too many flaws with this release to recommend it to anyone. Being a big fan myself, I would rather save my hard-earned money in this economy. All the band needed to do was place their best material of two separate compact discs-one with Roth material and one with Hagar. It really should not have been that difficult. In closing, I am sure every fan could name at least a half dozen tracks that were left off here. Opinions will differ, (and I encourage comments on mine), but here is what I believe this set should have consisted of:    DISC 1  -RUNNIN' WITH THE DEVIL  -ERUPTION  -YOU REALLY GOT ME  -AIN'T TALKIN' 'BOUT LOVE  -I'M THE ONE  -FEEL YOUR LOVE TONIGHT  -DANCE THE NIGHT AWAY  -LIGHT UP THE SKY  -DOA  -BEAUTIFUL GIRLS  -AND THE CRADLE WILL ROCK...  -EVERYBODY WANTS SOME!!  -MEAN STREET  -HEAR ABOUT IT LATER  -UNCHAINED  -SO THIS IS LOVE?  -SECRETS  -INTRUDER/(OH)PRETTY WOMAN  -DANCING IN THE STREET  -LITTLE GUITARS (INTRO)/LITTLE GUITARS  -JUMP  -PANAMA  -HOT FOR TEACHER  -I'LL WAIT    DISC 2  -WHY CAN'T THIS BE LOVE?  -DREAMS  -SUMMER NIGHTS  -BEST OF BOTH WORLDS  -LOVE WALKS IN  -MINE ALL MINE  -WHEN IT'S LOVE  -CABO WABO  -FINISH WHAT YA STARTED  -FEELS SO GOOD  -POUNDCAKE  -JUDGEMENT DAY  -RUNAROUND  -RIGHT NOW  -TOP OF THE WORLD  -THE SEVENTH SEAL  -DON'T TELL ME   -AMSTERDAM

0307454541|4.0|To be honest, I had no idea what I was buying when I ordered this book.  It was on the bestseller list for a long time and I finally took the plunge.  The first 100 pages or so were dull - a bland set up.  I almost stopped reading!  Then, seemingly out of nowhere, Stieg Larssen grips you and drags you into a high paced story with well developed characters.<br /><br />This book was well worth the read, and I am now on the third book in the trilogy.  If you like thrillers with in depth characters, you will love this book!
0452287022|3.0|You know, I found this well written, but it left me wondering, what was the point?<br />Also, why all the secrecy that she was helping the artist with his colors? You would expect the servants in that era to help with this task. Didn't get that part at all.<br />However, liked the milieu depicted and overall enjoyed the book.

B002ZG981E|4.0|I purchased this [Blu-ray - DVD - Digital copy] combo pack, but when it arrived, it was THREE DAYS past the expiration date for the download of the digital copy! Total rubbish. Only reason I gave it 4 stars.
B004LP601S|4.0|Reduced to a duo, Panic! At The Disco (now with reclaimed exclamation marks!) limp back to their emo-roots on \\"Vices and Virtues.\\" Drummer Spencer Smith and guitar/vocalist Brendon Urie keep the name alive as bassist Jon Walker and guitarist Ryan Ross split. It's hard to tell who split for what reason, but \\"Vices and Virtues\\" is a clear step back from the goofy psychedelia of \\"Pretty Odd.\\" Urie and Smith didn't completely drop their pastiche of everything 60's (as filtered perhaps, through XTC), but this album is in no way an obvious follow-up to \\"Pretty Odd's\\" naked ambition.<br /><br />In fact, I was one of the reviewers who thought PO was a five star effort, reinvigorating the pomp and entertainment of bands like Jellyfish. Opener \\"Ballad of Mona Lisa\\" certainly attempts a recall of that giddy power-pop, then the album lurches firmly back into the mold of \\"Fever You Can't Sweat Out.\\" This return to emo is not a vice, as PATD is really good at it, but it's not always a virtue. Urie and Smith keep up an energetic pace, and they love the production style that includes the phrase \\"and the kitchen sink.\\" However, these two were not PATD's original principle songwriters, and some of the songs lack that killer hook.<br /><br />That isn't a problem on the finale, \\"Nearly Witches.\\" This song sounds like a leftover from the PO sessions, contains two kitchen sinks and has the killer hook. As \\"Vice's\\" oddball out song, it's a standout along with \\"Mona Lisa.\\" \\"Let's Kill Tonight,\\" \\"Ready To Go\\" and the ballad \\"Always\\" are the other keepers on the CD, and indicate that if Urie and Smith can work on their writing chops, this edition of Panic! At The Disco may be one that lasts.
B004O88LPA|5.0|Until I happened across this being aired on TV, I didn't realize this existed.   I had enjoyed [[ASIN:B0010X741Y Hogfather]] and finding this movie was a great surprise.  I think it is more magical for me given that I've read most of Pratchett's books and have met and had discussions with him in person.       Watching this movie was like a mini vacation to a fun faraway place.    I think that Sean Astin is brilliant as Twoflower.  The role is a difficult one to do successfully and he absolutely nails it!  Outside of Lord of the Rings, this is my favorite role he has done.       And then the luggage... perfect!  Menacing and mysterious..  really good job of portraying the luggage as I imagined it.   For me, the Rincewind character wasn't what I had imagined.  Through the movie I grew to like the character and forget my preconceptions.     Overall... I think the typical Pratchett fan will love the movie.  I certainly did.  If not a fan, I think this movie is still great, just may not be as magical as the experience was for me.
B003INBNXO|5.0|A well rounded movie. Not a fast paced flick containing beautiful cinematography and stunning choreography. Plus, being a big Donnie Yen fan, I tend to buy the other two in the series to complete my TRIL-IP-GY!
0767836324|4.0|This version of Peter Pan's Capt Hook is entertaining. Anyone wanting to know more about the villain will find this movie amusing. My young grandsons enjoyed it as well.
B003INBNXO|5.0|IP Man is an excellent film. I saw a small clip and I was enticed to purchase the DVD to add to my martial arts collection. The movie is rife with modern film techniques blended very smoothly with some of the best fight choreography I can recall. Donnie Yen is sublime as the venerable IP Man. His acting skills are quite good and his fighting sequences are very believable. I highly recommend this movie.
1423389387|5.0|*This is a review of the audio book*<br /><br />Just as he did with _The Name of the Wind_ Nick Podehl has done a marvelous job of bringing Rothfuss' beautiful words, story, and characters to life. I have to admit that I had my doubts when I first ordered the book, Podehl immediately put those to rest. The voices he adopts for the characters are spot on and shaped what I heard in my head as I read _The Wise Man's Fear_.<br /><br />And let me say that listening to the book after having read it added a new layer of enjoyment. The poetry of Kvothe's conversations with Felurian is more enjoyable when listened to. In fact, Rothfuss' words beg to be read aloud and Podehl does a marvelous job with them.
B003OML23K|5.0|You would expect this book to be a \\"heartwarmer\\" but I loved the honest insights into the dynamics of a modern family. Yes there is humor and unabashed parental pride, but these are tempered by very real issues and fears and that made for good story telling and a very satisfying read. This would be an excellent nonfiction choice for book club discussion.
B001974DG0|5.0|The other night I watched a movie based on this book again and decided to write a review of the book out of gratitude.  True, the movie did not do the book justice, but it was based on a book I really enjoyed and I ended up enjoying the movie.  I have read so many of Koontz' books back before the kindle and the ability to dash off a few words of appreciation that I decided to pick out a couple of them to herald.  The image of the dog is in my mind indelibly.  I felt a swelling of joy that such a creature existed in the story!  Of course, it is a story, I know, but I do so enjoy getting wrapped up in the books I read.
B000FC12ZA|1.0|(0 STARS for this FRAUD) I remember when this book was first available in paperback, I happened to work at a bookstore in the Seattle area. Like so many others I believed this author's story was a genuine account. Now that I am back in college and just finished taking an Anthropology class I now know this book was a complete fraud. One of my Professors has actually worked among the aboriginals of La Perouse in AU, beginning in 1996. She has been working on an ethnography and shared some insights on the real story of these tribal people.<br /><br />If you want to find out more about what really happened to aboriginals in Australia watch the movie [[ASIN:B00005JLD4 Rabbit-Proof Fence]] available right here on Amazon. (also available to stream) This movie is based on a real life account. The movie released in 2002 shared a part of history that most Australians themselves were oblivious to as well as some younger aboriginals. It's a moving story.<br /><br />You can also google Marlo Morgan and find details of the fraud she committed and how it has affected the aboriginals.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|Old Man's War was a good, quick read on the Kindle.  It reminded me (and apparently a lot of other reviewers) of Heinlein's [[ASIN:0441783589 Starship Troopers]] (the book, not that movie which made me cry), albeit without quite reaching that level.  I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could, but I can't and its not quite (quite) on the same level as five star books like [[ASIN:0441783589 Starship Troopers]], [[ASIN:0553386794 A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book One]] or [[ASIN:0756405890 The Name of the Wind (Kingkiller Chronicles, Day 1)]], so four stars it is.  But as a fan of fantasy, I have to admit that this is one of the first sci-fi books I have read in more than a decade and it reminded me of why I *used* to like the genre.    There's a limited amount you can say about the premise of the book without giving away its early secret; a secret which, frankly, is telegraphed like a William Shatner punch.  But I don't like spoilers so I won't spoil it.  In any event, the writing is crisp and the action interesting.  The dialog is (generally) witty and there are many good turns of phrase that caused me to laugh out loud (no, I will not use the acronym).      In any event, if you're a Kindle owner (and if you're not, c'mon, paper is *so* Second Millennium) I strongly suggest you download the sample.  If you like the writing style, then you'll really enjoy the story.
1592332803|5.0|This cookbook is fantastic. The recipes, unlike those in many other vegan cookbooks, are not designed to turn baked goods into health food: they're designed to make baked goods vegan (though there are many recipes that are very healthy). The book is a great resource for bakers, whether vegan or not. There is a great variety of recipes, and they are quite straightforward.
B004UIOUHC|5.0|Ran this on my blackberry and just installed on HTC Evo! Love it! Tabbed browsing, bookmarks...great web experience! Highly recommend to everyone!
B0011UBDTK|5.0|Sex and the City is a true gem; the type of show that doesn't come around every day. It is incredibly well-written and acted, and is always entertaining. Sarah Jessica Parker as Carrie Bradshaw is so convincing as a single 30-something sex columnist living in Manhattan that you almost feel like you're watching a reality show - except the cinematography is light years ahead. The conversation between the 4 friends (Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha) is very realistic, and makes you feel as if you're having drinks with your girlfriends. The show's intelligent writing is sometimes pretty R-rated, and the episodes often contain graphic sex scenes - not for children's eyes. All the boyfriends out there who buy this box set as a gift for their girlfriends might get easily maxed-out on chick-flick type banter, but overall, it's a good show regardless of gender. I once made an ex-boyfriend of mine sit through several episodes, and I caught him laughing out loud several times. This entire series is addictive - once you watch one, it's hard to stop because each one is so good. This set will easily keep you entertained for months. Any woman can relate to the stories of love, loss, hardship, friendship, and real life. The perfect gift for any adult woman.
0316069353|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  I was hesitant to it buy when I say that it was only given three stars until I saw how many of the negatives were the price.  I wish to also echo other reviewers, Amazon please create another forum for disgruntled readers to give feedback on price rather than the book review!     In terms of the book content I have worked around the legal system for many years and thought that the detail in the court room was was excellent.  It was believable and managed to give a good trial chronology without being dry.  I liked the ending---it was a good twist. For a light, readable legal thriller I recommend this book.
B004LUS390|5.0|This is really a pretty powerful little drawing app.  It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of a high end PC drawing app, of course, but with a selection of brushes and the ability to use layers and opacity you can do a lot with it.  It's my favorite app for my gTablet...and it's a dollar!  Can't beat that.
B004MNVKVO|3.0|I was expecting this to sound as good the snakes and arrows limited edition DVD but it falls short.  I was hoping the drums would be exploding out of my subwoofer but I didn't hear that.  The sound is kind of thin but it is very clear and detailed. I seriously doubt the blue ray edition sounds any better than the DVD version but I'll leave that for others to determine. This definately not a five star compilation so I am wondering what I am missing. It's a toss up whether I would recommend this if you already have the CD.
B004529NKC|2.0|If what you like about Step Up is the dancing, the acting, or the story...don't bother buying Step Up 3.  The acting is horrible, the story could have been written by a 5 year old and it would be the same or even better. The dancing is not that bad, however all the special effects and 3-D bullsht keeps you from really seeing it. Step Up 1 and 2 were a good work, the 3d one looks like they came Up with an idea and made it in one day
B000P0I4O4|5.0|This film starts off slow but picks up the pace quickly; once the storyline takes place. Both actor's have strong leading roles opposite of each other, dealing with self-conscience decisions that need to be made.
B00062I6TO|5.0|As usual, Kleiber conducts with emotion, rhythmic perfection and great knowledge of style.  Each selection seems to be treated as a single, finely honed entity.  You can't go wrong with Carlos Kleiber.
B004UID2LC|1.0|kind of pointless since it wont let you search for videos you actually want to watch. Instead it feeds you random videos which as we all know is the norm on youtube. I guess this would be ok if you like spending time watching random crap, otherwise your better off staying away from this half a##ed Turd.    If it clearly stated there was no ability to search for videos you actually want to watch I wouldnt have bothered with this. In the future I wont give these people the pleasure of my input as I won't be trying out any  of their new apps based on my experience with this.
0321704452|5.0|This a great book, the first I have read by Garr Reynolds. It cuts right to the chase and has some great advice throughout the book.  You can probably find 90% of the advice in this book in other works, but this book is laid out so well that it really stands out from the rest. It is a beautiful full color book that really practices what it preaches. By the end, you feel like you just sat through an engaging, creative presentation on how to present well.<br /><br />Some of the things that really helped me include:<br /><br />Simplify. Your presentations are too long, cut them down.<br /><br />Use graphics for your visuals as much as possible, not text. Never just read a slide.<br /><br />Two things to start with: 1. What's your point?  2. Why does it matter?<br /><br />Connect emotionally, don't perform a data dump.<br /><br />One of things I really liked about this book were the two page interviews throughout with other great presenters. Very helpful advice.<br /><br />Other people who have reviewed this work say that this book is more for the advanced presenters, but I disagree. As someone who rarely speaks in front of people in a formal setting, I found a ton of useful information. I would not make it my only recommendation for a new presenter, but its certainly on the list. Whether you are a beginner or a seasoned presenter, get this book.<br /><br />If you are a beginner, I also recommend: [[ASIN:1929774443 The Exceptional Presenter: A Proven Formula to Open Up and Own the Room]]
B001UV4XHY|2.0|I love Harry Potter but I was really disappointed with this one.  The entire movie was at night and to me it did not live up to the story lines of all of the previous movies. Maybe it will all come together after Part 2.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|I started reading Connelly books about two years ago and I haven't put them down yet. Haller is a great character and his stories always amaze me ... this one was no exception. Connelly is a terrific writer that knows the true ins and outs of law enforcement and the court room. His work is always brilliantly written. Plus, he always puts a twist (or two) when you least expect it. Again, this book did not disappoint. Maybe I should have expected it by now, but the ending was still a shock. And Haller going to the good side?? I can't wait to see how that plays itself out - I love him as a defense attorney, I can't wait to see him in action again on the good side. HIGLY RECOMMEND THIS READ!
B004QK5N5W|1.0|First off, yes I have an iPad2.    When this thing works, it's great but I have had a pretty terrible time with it.  Almost every time the first time I plug it into my TV or receiver the sound doesn't work.  If that isn't the problem then sometimes it will just say mode not supported.  After a few times if unplugging and plugging the adapter back in it will eventually work.    If I'm lucky it will continue to work.    If I get an email and my sound is on the video is will often freeze for a second or so.  One time it just froze and stayed frozen so I had to stop it and then start the whole process of unplugging it and plugging it in again.    I don't know if I got a bad adapter or what but I've just had really bad luck with this thing.  When it works it's great but for me, there are a lot of hoops to jump through before it actually starts working.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Love this app. Attention is spent on ease and functionality whether than looks and glammer.<br />It was a little confusing at first but once I really sat down and configured it to my needs I was able to see how simple it is.
B001L83PLQ|5.0|I was a college student during this time and had barely heard of Nigeria and knew nothing of Biafra.  The pictures of dying children with distended bellies brought many of a dose of reality that came with the daily pictures from Vietnam.  How we as a country let this suffering go on still amazes me.  This book seemed far more like a first person account of the war than a novel.  Read it only if you're prepared to be shocked and educated.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|Stevie never ceases to amaze me.  I thought her Live in Chicago performance was her best live performance ever and now I think this latest CD is her best ever.<br /><br />Kudos to Dave Stewart for not doing anything to overpower Stevie's \\"Stevieness\\" :)<br /><br />While I love Stevie collaborating with other writers, when it comes right down to it, the songs in which she writes the music and lyrics usually prove to be my favorites and that is the case this time around.  Moonlight, in my opinion, the finest Stevie song ever.  After that, I'm really loving Everybody Loves You, Italian Summer and New Orleans.<br /><br />The sound is big, lush, fully realized while not being overdone or over produced.  Stevie's voice has never sounded better.<br /><br />I read the reviews by people who wish it was the 80s again or wish another producer had produced this CD.  The 80s are gone and artists need to change and grow and create things new and different.  Stevie is not now and never has been someone created my the marketing dept of a record company.  Stevie has a true sense of herself and that has always been found in all her music.<br /><br />Simply by using a word or phrase from a past song, Stevie bridges the past and present and has instilled a hauntingly familiar quality to her songs that never fail to give me goosebumps.
0525422943|5.0|I devoured this book in a couple of hours. Told from Adam's point of view, the reader experiences Adam's misery that he has been dealing with since the break up, which he can also thank for his last album, and his own memories that haunt him. Although Adam seems to have it all--the music, the fame, the celebrity girlfriend--he has been heartbroken and depressed since the day Mia left him behind and music isn't enough anymore. Now, in New York, he is about to leave for another tour that he really doesn't want to go on. While walking through the city, he notices Mia is performing and decides to sit in.    For one last night the two spend time together in New York, the delve into each other's lives trying to catch up but Adam is so distracted by his own questions about their break up that he pretends to be calmer around her than he feels. You feel very close to Adam in this book and only want what will make him happy. After everything that Adam went through to get to his dream, he now leads a miserable life that he would gladly give up to go back to a time where Mia was his girlfriend and he still loved music.    In a achingly bittersweet novel, the two are reunited and have to decide if this is a sign that means anything. While the narrative is in Adam's perspective, its very close in style to the narrative in Mia's perspective, which I enjoyed because I really liked If I Stay. An amazing sequel to If I Stay, better than I could have ever expected. Sit down with a box of tissues and read this book. I have never seen a character in a novel be more alive then Adam in Where She Went.    More reviews at [...]
0470450266|5.0|Explains everything in detail with references, pictures and snapshots. Comes with brushes, sample files, videos to help get started! Absolutely a must have for those who wish to get a good understanding of human anatomy! 5 stars any day!
0061726826|5.0|When love has a mandatory cure and is known to lead people to death when left uncured, there is nothing Lena wants more than to lead a normal life. Living in the US, surrounded by borders to protect it's inhabitants from the Invalids and Sympathizers that live in the Wilds, she is safe and can live a life of happiness after the cure with the husband chosen for her and the career she is appointed to. She has always followed the rules and trusted her elders that the cure is the only way to avoid the deliria because she was told that it had made her mother commit suicide. Lena is counting the days until she will be safe from the sickness that took her mother away--until the day she falls in love herself. Lena goes through significant changes throughout the novel and is as strong a heroine as I've ever seen. Once she falls victim to the deliria, she stands up against what she feels is wrong, even when it means breaking all the rules. Even when she knows that she is sick, she doesn't care because love is worth the worst kind of sickness. Lena discovers that she can finally see through the fog that everyone living within the borders lives with.    Lena meets a boy that makes her forget about the deliria and all of its worries. She would rather live sick for the rest of her days to feel even a sliver of the amount of happiness she feels with Alex. Sneaking around becomes easier for them and they spend a great amount of time together. Over the days that Lena should be counting until the cure, she forgets to be excited about her match, and about her future in school and her family. Nothing inhabits her thoughts more than Alex.    This dystopian story is beautifully written and will make you keep turning pages. Oliver is descriptive and makes you fall in love with Lena and cast, makes you hate the government and the cure, and makes you swoon over and over. I wanted to cry for Lena, I wanted her to take chances for love because she was finally happy. I will be very impatientlyawaiting the next novel in this trilogy and would recommend it to anyone and everyone. This is definitely one of my favorite books EVER! Lauren Oliver has worked her way onto my list of favorite authors. If you read any dystopian novel this year, make sure you read this one.    For more reviews go to [...]
0061537969|5.0|It's no wonder this book is on the NYT best sellers list.  It's wonderfully written from the perspective of a dog and really speaks to the human spirit.  It's a quick, easy read that will ring true deep down.    Great book.
B00338QENI|5.0|From the first pages this book pulls you into the story of Henrietta Lacks and her cells unbelievable journey to immortality.  I love the way this story is laid out, you start with Henrietta at the end of her life and progress in a way that you learn her whole story and also the story of how many scientists come to utilize her cells for research.  The end of this story even made me tear up.  Due to so many positive reviews I recommended this story for book club and so far everyone has truly enjoyed it.  The author has a special way of writing about the science so that it doesn't go over your head and adds a lot of humanity to sometimes sterile conditions.  The one thing I would have loved, or would love to see in a future work is how the establishment of the trust fund for Henrietta's grandchildren went or is going.  Well, well worth the money paid for the Kindle edition.  One warning, the Kindle editions pictures are obviously black and white for all, which I didn't think made much difference until I saw a print copy with color pictures.
0439023513|5.0|Also reviewed on my blog, the Vintage Bookworm. [...]<br /><br />Oh. My. God. I don't even know what to say about this book. I'm very heart-broken that this series has ended. I tried to read it slow, to savor every last detail of the book, but it was just too good and I had to devour it!<br /><br />Even though a lot has changed and it wasn't as good as The Hunger Games (Of course!) it was amazing! I finished it hours ago and I can't stop thinking about it, and I doubt I will for a while. Each book has continued to haunt me.<br /><br />Katniss has grown so much since volunteering to take her sister's place in The Hunger Games. She's been forced to grow up. She never gets a break! Just when it seems like she can try and calm down a bit and just try and face the nightmares she already has to deal with, something else happens to bring on more nightmares.<br /><br />But she isn't the only one. A lot of other characters is thrown into the category as well. Namely Gale, Peeta, Prim, Finnick.<br /><br />I think this might of been the more emotional one out of the trilogy. But I can't completely set my mind on one because all of them set you on an emotional roller coaster ride.<br /><br />Just like the first two books, I was never able to guess at what would happen next. I could try and guess, but would always fail.<br /><br />I am very happy with the Epilogue, and I'm going to leave it at that because I don't want to give anything away. I canNOT wait for the freaking Hunger Games movie. I am counting down and hoping and praying they don't screw it up too much. Hopefully it will follow Harry Potters lead and be as close to the book they can get it!<br /><br />I recommend this to everyone. This series should definitely be on your to read list! It's worth every bit of the hype it is getting!
B001UV4XI8|5.0|I love this show and have every movie and book.  This is great for both children and adults.  When my younger one and best friend were arguing at breakfast  I picked up the first book and started reading.  After that breakfast was quiet and both girls learned to love reading and both improved in school.  The movies are a great thing to do with family.
B002ZTQVGQ|1.0|Ponyo is very weird and sorta creepy.Because1)Ponyo father looked like a woman , but still a man at the same time( me and my brother watched this movie together and we was debating if he was a man or woman).2)The fate of the whole world depends on a five year old boy loving a fish girl,are you kidding me?3)Five year olds loving each other, personally i think its kinda wrong , because are they too young to know what love is or not.4)The boy's mom is okay with this?So Ponyo was plain weird.

B004EWFUQY|5.0|On what I've read so far:<br /><br />The reviews shouldn't really be about the book, more about the diet. Attack Phase was well explained, with many more options to eat that you would think, and very good recepies. Second phase again well explaine, harder to follow than the first phase because it is longer, but in all the book explains everything well. Third phase, gives you more choices of what you can eat but you have to be more carefull as all you have done could have been for nothing ig you don't follow the steps correctly. Finaly 4th phase, life long phase, the creator of the diet doesn't ask for much, but you should follow his word bit by bit. By the 4th phase you have completely changed your way of eating and thinking, so it should not be difficult.<br /><br />Myself on the diet:<br />Day 1: I just started yesterday, started on 230 pounds, had 2 eggs with tofu for breakfast, half broiled chiken for lunch, salmon filet for dinner and as a night snack had the galette (added cinnamon and vanilla extract for flavor) with some fat free cream cheese (SO GOOD!!)<br /><br />Day 2: Weighted myself this morning, 228.5, almost 1.5 pounds lost of the first day, good for me. Started of the day with another galette, followed by a not so good lunch (I may have broken the second day by mistake) as I had nothing at all to eat and thought that MAYBE those Breast Chicken Selects from McD's were inside the \\"what I can eat\\", when I bought them I realized they weren't but I had already wasted my money and had nothing else to eat. For dinner had some grilled chicken and a \\"shake\\" made with silken tofu, fat free milk and some cinnamon. And of course had more than the required 1.5 quarts of water (I have never visited the bathroom so often in a day).<br /><br />Day 3: Weight 225.5 (3 pounds lost yesterday).<br /><br />Day 6: First day of Cruise Phase, lost 9.5 pounds on the Attack Phase. I have to say back back in November-December I was weighting 270 pounds. At the time I decided tochange my eating habits and by March-April lost 40 pounds. Since I was not follong any diet nor had a plan I got stuck by 230-235 pounds and was afrai to gain it all back (started eating more and mora cra... That was what got my on this diet. I needed something to guide me and keep my on my goal. After been over a month stuck in the same weight and probably starting to gain weight back, lost almost 10 pounds in 5 days and I am eager to continue the diet.

0307593495|3.0|Having read all of the Kurt Wallander books, I was overjoyed when this showed up as an Amazon Vine Program choice. When it got here, I dove right in. Unfortunately, since the last time I'd read a Wallander, I'd read all the Steig Larsson books, and Larsson's series so completely overshadows Henning Mankell's Wallander series that I kept waiting to be caught up in the plot of \\"The Troubled Man\\", and I wasn't.<br />Possibly Mankell is burned out on Kurt Wallander, because that was the way it seems. \\"The Troubled Man\\" is not a fitting addition to the series, but is weaker by far than any of the previous books. Oh, well, I'd totally enjoyed all the previous books, and one clinker in the bunch is not bad, it's just too bad.<br />I'd rather hoped that Linda Wallander would move to the forefront as Kurt is getting older, but as she is now a mother, I doubt that will happen.<br />I only hope that Henning Mankell will grace us in the future with better books than this.

B00316DDUE|5.0|This by no means a bad video but its missing the magic that Live at the Acropolis had. There are tons of special affects and the music is faster paced but I found the power of the orchestra lacking. There is no substitute for sheer numbers of instruments. Its a video that is worth watching especially on Blu-Ray. You can tell that the whole performance is not shown and there must be some parts that were cut. Since its a BluRay they could have easily put the whole performance on the disc. I'm still going to give a 5 star because its still a awesome video but I have to admit I was expecting greater things.

B004NCLKJG|5.0|This Walk&uuml;re has a dream cast of Birgit Nilsson, Leonie Rysanek and Jon Vickers as Siegmund. Nilsson is in exceptional form here, ringing off clarion tones with seemingly impossible ease. She is matched by the late, great Thomas Stewart, an underrated bass-baritone who sang the role of Wotan on the Karajan recording of this opera.<br /><br />The W&auml;lsung twins Siegmund and Sieglinde feature the near-ideal pairing of Jon Vickers and Leonie Rysanek. The two singers share great onstage chemistry from the first lines, and the first act crackles with repressed Wagnerian sexual energy. The onion in their ointment is the Hunding of Karl Ridderbusch, another underrated singer. He brings black, resonant tone to the most unsympathetic role in the opera. Croatian conductor Berislav Klobu'ar leads a brisk, invigorating performance in the model of his teacher, Clemens Krauss.

0307592839|2.0|This is not a bad book. But it's hardly a great book. I'd call it a decent book, maybe \\"good,\\" at best. It has some nice insightful moments, but I found the structure to be jarring, disjointed, and downright confusing. It lacks any sort of cohesion, as it flits from one character's point of view to another.    Furthermore, I bought this book because the description printed here on Amazon, along with the picture of the guitar on the cover, lead me to believe that it was about classic era punk rock in the Bay Area, or at least that it was set in that world. In point of fact, punk rock barely gets a passing mention. Some of the characters work in the music business, but this is not a book about music.    I have deliberately refrained from using the word \\"novel\\" to describe this work, because it feels to me more like a series of short stories, with varying degrees of relatedness. I wouldn't say that I hated it, but I was definitely disappointed by it. And I'm kind of dumbfounded that it won a Pulitzer. I thought that that prize was meant to be for truly great works, which, sadly, is not how I would describe \\"A Visit From the Goon Squad.\\"    I would have given it two and a half stars if that were an option, but since it's not, I rounded down, so as not to confuse it with items that I mildly enjoyed.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|After playing the original and seasons, I was very excited about Rio. It is definitely fun, just different than the original.
B004TB6GUY|5.0|Yep, it's another great CD. If you're looking for a hard-rockin heavy CD, than this is not it. If you're looking for a CD to mellow out and relax - that's deep with musical talent - pick this up. There were parts that reminded me of \\"Book of Shadows\\", which if you haven't heard it, check out the reviews on this site. Zakk is incredibly good at taking heavy songs and making acoustic versions of them. If you love great music and you \\"get it\\", you will love this CD. If you like a lot of the new \\"generic\\" bands, you probably won't \\"get it\\", as you probably don't recognize true talent and musical genius. On a side note, heavy metal is my preferred music of choice - but I also appreciate good mellow music. A must buy for serious music lovers!
157912626X|5.0|Once I read The Body in the Library, it was like a whole new level of mystery novels opened up for me. At the end of the book I was completely suprised who te murdered was, which, for me, only happens in a book thats a true winner. I was tied to my chair reading this novel...I stayed up late reading it, and I relished every word. Plus, Agatha Christie makes her murders and mysteries with a sense of humor, so I never got bored! The Body in the Library is a MUST READ (I am completely serious- you HAVE to read it) and I encourage any age of reader to buy it!<br />This book matched up all my expectations-it was beautifully written, had no typos whatsoever, and was chock-full of so many plot twists and red herrings that I was glued to the page.
B004IQMXD4|4.0|Being a fan of Stevie I have to say that this material was a little to amateurish for someone like her. Definitly it's new in mood and lyrics. My two favorites are the ones were she duets with Dave, a match made in heaven: Cheaper than free is very moving, and Everybody loves you (I can see Annie Lenox doing it!) is so jazzy but still so Stevie. Annabel Lee, the lyrics were well adapted. Ghosts are gone is the only one that will remind you old Stevie. At the end you dont feel you lost your money but something is missing. For new fans it will be fun.
0439023521|3.0|This book does a pretty good job at bringing you into a different world and introducing you to a few almost-likable characters. It was written well enough that I wanted to finish it. That being said, I found this book altogether disappointing.    1. The main character isn't likable. I was rooting for her but at the same time, but I really care about her. I realize that she is on some personal journey to find herself, but it came across as a gray and frustrating character.  2. This is the first of a trilogy. This book would have been far superior as a standalone book with some conclusions. Nothing is really concluded. It is a complete set up.  3. If you don't want to cheer when innocent children die, this is not the book for you.  4. Really? Another love triangle? There's only so much of this that I can take: \\"I don't know anything. I'm just a young girl and to know my own feelings is hard. The one boy is good then on the other hand the other boy is good in a different way. I will have to string them both along...\\"  5. The writing isn't anything special. It's good enough, I suppose. I think some details are overlooked.  6. The violence is pretty graphic, if that is a concern for you.  7. In the end, I was disappointed when the main character didn't die. It would have been more profound and noteworthy. Alas, you cannot sell two more books unless the first book is not concluded.     I think this book is worth reading if you have nothing better to do or to see for yourself what all the hype is about. In the least, this book stirred up my emotions, even if most of those emotions were frustration.
B004GHYCKW|5.0|PJ Harvey already has one album on Rolling Stone's Top 500 Albums of All Time list (Rid of Me) and I don't think it would be a stretch to say that this one could handily bump another off of that list and take it's rightful place there. Good god, can this woman make music or what?  To be brief, if you're already a fan you'll absolutely love this album. Love. If you're not familiar with her work, before purchasing this, pleaseohpleaseohplease find some of her music videos or performances on YouTube and listen to at least 3-5 songs from as many albums as no two are alike. Her music is such that you will either love it or loathe it. Period. I happen to love it.  I'll readily admit that this 5 star review is a bit biased and of no surprise as I've been a rabid fan of her since I was 11 years old and even named my first car &#34;The Polly Jean Machine&#34;. As I've grown and evolved, so has she and her music. PJ Harvey is the soundtrack to my life. Sooo glad she afforded me the opportunity to add this album to that soundtrack.

B000002UA5|4.0|In 1969 Pink Floyd was little known outside the `arty' environment of university concert halls in England. The band was regarded as an avant-garde bunch of intellectual experimenters characterised by live concerts using (for the time) big amplification and psychedelic light shows, space-age themes, jamming over extended and partly-structured musical pieces and quirky black humour. They had no `front man' and did not have, or seek, a mainstream audience or commercial presence on the airwaves. They were an `album band' whose reputation spread through the student population by word-of-mouth and through music-industry press like the Melody Maker.<br /><br />\\"Ummagumma\\" (a 1960s Cambridge University slang word for sex) is the most interesting and distinctive of Floyd's pre-DSOTM albums and something of a milestone in the development of the band's experimental ideas, which led down the road to the more disciplined and structured sound of Obscured by Clouds, DSOTM and WYWH. In no way could this quirky two-disk album be described as `easy listening' but it definitely has its moments.<br /><br />The two disks are completely separate in style and content. The first contains fine recordings of a live performance at Birmingham and Manchester College of Commerce in June 1969. The four tracks are:<br /><br />* Astronomy Domine<br />* Careful with that Axe Eugene<br />* Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun<br />* A Saucerful of Secrets<br /><br />Each extends and deepens the studio original to around the ten-minute mark and demonstrates the band's appeal as a somewhat `out there' live act in the late 60s; moving away from straight songs to longer, more involved pieces containing sections of instrumental improvisation over insistent bass lines. Every one of these four tracks demands some listener attention and still sounds great through headphones.<br /><br />The second disk is where, for some, Ummagumma falls into self-indulgence. Each of the four members of the band contributes ten minutes of their own experimental musical musings and the result is a mixed bag. The least accessible and most obscure is probably Rick Wright's piece `Sisyphus' - an instrumental realization of the classical Greek legend about the king condemned by Zeus to forever roll a large rock up a hill, only to see it roll down again, as a punishment for his hubris and deceit. The fact it found its way onto a rock album in 1969 says a lot about the music industry at the time (good and bad) because nothing like this would be tolerated in the commercially-driven environment of the 21st century.<br /><br />Next up is Roger Waters with `Grantchester Meadows,' a gentle acoustic guitar ballad themed on a lazy summer afternoon complete with sound effects (Grantchester meadows is near Cambridge) and the indisputable highlight of the studio album, similar in mood and execution to `If' on Atom Heart Mother. The quirky ending has someone trying to swat a buzzing insect, ending with a satisfying final `thwack' - a classic Floyd touch from the Barrett period. It's followed by the outrageous, multi-tracked and downright silly `Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving with a Pict', clever and witty and prone to induce belly laughs, especially the strong Highland dialect rant at the end (what WAS Roger smoking?).<br /><br />Dave Gilmour's `The Narrow Way' (in 3 parts) follows - the final part in particular is good with a powerful minor-key melody over slow driving rhythm and restrained vocal line. Nick Mason's rather forgettable `The Grand Vizier's Garden party' concludes: instrumental and percussive, attempting to tell a story through music as with Wright's piece. It might appeal to drummers but for the rest of us, it's neither great nor memorable.<br /><br />It's instructive to listen to Ummagumma 40 years on and realise how far the music industry has travelled in the intervening years. It's inconceivable that something as experimental and self-indulgent as disk two might be even contemplated by any record company in these more superficial, money-obsessive and image-driven times.<br /><br />In conclusion, Ummagumma is worth buying for the live disk and, especially, for `Grantchester Meadows' and maybe `The Narrow Way' on the studio disk. Overall it's a four star album - though the live stage recordings on disk one, if released as a single disk, might on their own qualify as five-star.f-indulgent as disk two might be even contemplated by any record company in these more superficial, money-obsessive and image-driven times.<br /><br />In conclusion, Ummagumma is worth buying for the live disk and, especially, for `Grantchester Meadows' and maybe `The Narrow Way' on the studio disk.

B004G6009K|5.0|I just got a new 3D TV and Tangled is one of the first 3D movies I bought. Here's my take:    - Beautiful packaging  - Good story and funny  - Very high picture and sound quality  - Great 3D effects, very clean, sharp, vibrant colors. There are some dark scenes with ghosting/crosstalk but my equipment is not the best out there so I'm not sure what's the cause. No complaint.    If you have a 3D TV, get Tangled 3D, you won't be disappointed. If you are not 3D ready yet, also get this combo, for future use.  Just 2 weeks ago I didn't care about 3D TV but my Blu-ray player happened to be 3D ready and 3D TV prices are getting close to 2D ones so I decided to get one and now I just can't get enough of it.
B004EC5IV6|5.0|Evangelion 2.22 is by far one of the best movies I've seen. With an amazing soundtrack, characters, design, etc. This is a title you wouldn't want to miss! This being the first movie I've ever bought on Amazon I was VERY disappointed at the shipping. It got here a day earlier then estimated but the orange sleeve over the DVD case was scratched and chipped (I bought a brand new copy). I'm the type of person that when I get addicted to something and fall in love with it I want it to be in perfect condition. This makes me a bit sad. I'll have to deal with it I guess.<br /><br />Overall the movie is fantastic and amazing. A title no Evangelion fan should miss out on.

B003TJ4YU6|5.0|This is new SOFA \\"revised\\" release of the Beatles on Ed Sullivan.  (I have the original 2006 SOFA release, also)   -On this \\"revised\\" release please be aware of various issues:     -Particular significance of the 2nd \\"Eddy Show\\" from Miami Beach on this \\"new\\" 2010 edition from SOFA shows a MAJOR improvement over what you see here verses the previous 2006 earlier SOFA release of the same. -I suspect an earlier/better quality generation master CBS video tape was used for this 2010 released video to DVD transfer and that substantial digital work was done during remastering. They've really done wonders in both sound and video improvements (most notable in the consecutive 2nd \\"Beatles Show\\" from the Deauville Hotel in Miami Beach.) -Bravo here! Curiously also the Sullivan 1964 trio \\"Beatles Shows\\" (No. 1 and 3) of the 1964 consecutive appearance trio on this presentation show several beginning broadcast seconds that were mysteriously \\"edited out\\" of the original 2006 SOFA edition!  -But, let's not stop. The bonus material shown here is really terrific. I well remember Ed's interview in London he conducted on film of the Beatles just after they had completed \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" in May/June 1964. It's now here to see and latter Eddy Shows of various 1966 and 1967 Beatles appearances that were filmed in England for a global audience are shown (on the \\"Bonus Section\\" in this 2010 twin DVD package. Ed's intros are there but, the 1966/1967 Beatles' appearances are not. -May be due to an unresolved \\"rights\\" issue.    -I was 13 years old at that time point in 1964 and watched it all happening. Yes indeed! Extremely exciting real-time back live back then as it happened in a far more innocent yet much, much better world.   BUY IT!

B003PWH4JA|4.0|I really enjoy Gaslight's songwriting and performance on American Slang but from a production (and end-listener) standpoint, I am very disappointed with the sonic quality of the mixing/mastering of American Slang, especially since Sink or Swim and the 59 Sound both sound so much better. American Slang is super compressed, midrange heavy and has no treble to speak of. I want to hear hi hats and crash cymbals! Whoever in production thought they had created a great sounding album was very wrong. I would love to hear this album remastered but that won't happen. Oh well. I think this is unfortunately par for the course in the mastered-for-Ipod era we live in.

B004LWZW24|4.0|I know I'll get butchered by some for the title, but the tension in this film was stupendous.  At all the right times, in all the right places, the scares and thrills are there.  Sure, it's a hodge-podge of Poltergeist, Exorcist and Paranormal Activity, but each aspect of those movies is accentuated to produce a genuinely frightening combination.<br /><br />After a family of five moves into a new home, it takes little time to realize something is wrong.  Items move, doors close.  When one child falls into a coma and the mother hears what sounds like Vin Diesel growling in some Gaelic dialect over the baby monitor, it's time to move despite the fact the father is a disbeliever.  Unlike the Jefferson's, moving on up doesn't work for this family and the frights return like ghost herpes.<br /><br />While creative license was necessary to move the story along, the astral plane concept is not completely embraceable.  Nonetheless, the rest of the movie hits on all cylinders.  Visually there isn't a lot, but what is presented works very effectively.  All the scare techniques (e.g. eerie noises, well chosen music accompaniment, quiet-to-loud shocks, quick reveal scares) are expertly crafted and executed.  Epic timing on more than one occasion.  None of the actors really stand out, and a few (a Ghostbusters reproduction) were somewhat silly, but Lin Shaye must be recognized for her interesting performance as a medium who ties the entire movie into a sleep-stealing knot.<br /><br />Impressed from beginning to end by this movie, I applaud the return to old fashioned, suspenseful horror that doesn't need a teenage sacrifice in a brothel, hostel, or abandoned building.  Not saying I dislike those, but Insidious is good for the change of pace.  The second half of the film is much slower than the terrifying first half, but if you've recently asked yourself, \\"Whatever happened to the slow build up?\\"  Watch this in a dark theater with a great speaker system.  Guaranteed thrills.
B0034G4P80|5.0|I am married to a woman who doesn't follow comics or comic characters at all! As a matter of fact, she didn't even know that Iron Man was a comic book character until I broke it to her today...and she loved both those movies. I know, however, that if she knows that a character in a movie is based off a comic, then she would be apt to not want to participate in its viewing.<br /><br />So, when she told me that she saw a preview of a movie called, \\"Thor,\\" and wanted to see it, I didn't bother telling her anything of the sort. I simply purchased the tickets and took her to the theater. Guess what? She loved it! And so did I!<br /><br />The Australian actor, Chris Hemsworth, does such an awesome and convincing job as The Mighty Thor from Asgard, that all the exceptional talent surrounding him only brings the picture from already Grade A quality to Grade A+ quality. Natalie Portman was perfectly cast, as was Kat Dennings, Stellan Skarsgard, Rene Russo (as Thor's mother, Frigga), and Tom Hiddleston (as Thor's brother, Loki). And let's not forget the powerful presence of the almost-unrecognizable Sir Anthony Hopkins as Thor's father, King Odin.<br /><br />The arrogant and careless, Thor, is cast out of Asgard and sent to live with humans on earth, where he falls in love, finds compassion and understanding within himself, and becomes the defender of humans. But ultimately, he must defend his world of Asgard against the evil Frost Giants.<br /><br />\\"Thor\\" is an awesome and fun time for the whole family, 13 years and up, depending on maturity level.<br /><br />Well done and kudos to all! FIVE STARS! *****
B000P0I4O4|2.0|In this clich&eacute;-riddled drama/thriller, John Cusack and Morgan Freeman turn in tired performances for a quick cash payout.  Either filming was directly after daily morning marathons, there were epic late night whiskey drinking contests, or both had substantial mob loans with escalating vigs.  To say they were less than vehement would be like saying the Bataan Death March was less than energetic.  Don't get me wrong.  Both are great actors and did fairly well compared to others.  Hence, the issue.  The remaining cast literally gave me an ulcer, and a child actor made me seriously consider a vasectomy.<br /><br />The plot, if you can call it that, is a tale as derivative as the 6th Police Academy movie.  But maybe not as good.  Ray (Cusack) is a gym teacher who has experienced problems lately.  Father-son drama after Mom died (or left because of the kid's acting), son gets into a little Mary Jane, camping ensues.  Because, like, the kid was an aspiring Eagle Scout or something and this will totally get them to overcome their transparently poor attempt to look at odds with one another.  Don't worry, it's hardly explained in the movie either.  Things go awry when filming starts...I mean, when they run into Frank (Freeman), an assassin with government/CIA ties, and his team of incompetent mercenaries who possess slightly more training than the local donut munching police in the non-distinct woodsy Washington town.  Ray is positioned as a pawn who must deliver Frank to the law.  Along the journey plot incontinence occurs.<br /><br />Character development is atrocious.  Aside from the aforementioned, the details are minimal.  We learn nothing of Frank's past, his motives, or his training.  It's all thinly veiled masturbatory excerpts from dog-eared Soldier of Fortune magazines.  His mid-movie acquisition of a conscious is even more poorly contrived.  Oh, did I mention that the only reason a trained merc. isn't gutting Ray's kid, decorating the forest with his entrails, and happily escaping is that Ray used to be a cop?  Because totally explains how he is able to not only control Frank but also survive the Three Stooges routine from the others.  Speaking of plot problems.  Off the top of my head, the helicopter scene was ridiculous, the midway addition to the cast is unexplainable fodder, and the twists involving federal agents were so underdeveloped they should have been deleted scenes.  The most egregious gaffe, however, is the murderer who stops mid-hunt, while just behind the guy he plans to kill, while hoping to save his boss who has all monetary access, while in a dense, cell coverage eliminating forest, to play chess online.  Read that again.<br /><br />Add in an ending that had all the deliberation of a duck-walk to the bathroom after a 3-day Taco Bell bender and you have a movie that not only deserved to go straight to the DVD bin despite its two stars, but maybe didn't deserve that much.

B0042MEQVG|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />Written by Melissa Rosenberg and directed by David Slade, \\"The Twilight Saga: Eclipse\\" is the third installment in the highly popular vampire-cum-werewolf teenage angst-fest based on the novels by Stephanie Meyer.<br /><br />Although Bella's tiresome romantic predicament - should she choose the vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) or the werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner)? - has been pretty much played out by this time (it's what ruined the second film, \\"New Moon\\"), the script here does provide an intriguing internal conflict for the young woman (Kristen Stewart) as she debates the pros and cons of becoming a vampire herself after high school graduation.  She has to decide whether what she'll be gaining from such a move - eternal youth, a fulfilling life with Edward - outweighs what she'll be giving up - her father and mother, Jacob's friendship, and any hope of ever having a family of her own.  The movie also ramps up the drama a bit when a band of out-of-control \\"newborn\\" vampires start wreaking havoc across the Pacific Northwest, leading the more mature vampires and the werewolves - bitter, sworn enemies of one another - to join forces in defeating them.<br /><br />These \\"Twilight\\" films lack the cutting-edge wit and irony one finds in a series like \\"True Blood,\\" as Meyer opts for romantic sappiness over postmodern sophistication every step of the way.  And the over-earnest and self-important tone leads to some intense silliness along the way.  Still they do have their moments.
0061992860|2.0|When this book arrived I went to look at the table of contents. It was then I noticed how shabby the binding was. It would definitely not withstand being kept in a back pack. Not only was the string barely holding it together , but the glue binding was on the verge of letting go. I guess this is what happens when you take the cheap route of sending it to China to be bound and printed!!    Is the content useful? It depends. I have been doing this since 1998 and I will answer your question this way. If you are going to be out in the woods, camping and want to survive if you get lost , Yes.  If you want to escape to the great outdoors in an escape and evade scenario because there is angry mob 5 miles down the road. YES.  But if you want the best urban survival guide I have read ( and I have now read over 30 of them) I recommend The Urban Survival Guide: by David Morris or When All Hell Breaks Loose: Stuff You Need To Survive When Disaster Strikes by Cody Lundin, And  98.6 Degrees: The Art of Keeping Your Ass Alive by Cody Lundin.  With these 3 books , that I highly recommend, all emergency, I need to know what to do now scenario's, will be covered in a manner that a layman can understand .  I have given these books to my family members and received many thanks from them.  In closing, the SAS book is a little over the edge for the average person and might scare them. But I do recommend it as a forth book to read and keep in the library.  Thanks for asking,  Vito A. Labella

B002HFWAWW|1.0|Another Echo Bridge Blu-ray, another crappy 1080p transfer. Equilibrium arrive on high-def with a presentation that would be slightly above-average in terms of detail quality and color consistency... if it weren't for its damned aspect ratio.

B003Y58CKS|4.0|There are positives and negatives here.<br />First the positives: The singers - all of them- are extraordinary! Lucic is certainly today's leading Verdi baritone, Damrau is radiant and sings beautifully, and Florez sings the Duke splendidly, first embellishing then capping the cabaletta, \\"Possente amor\\" with a magnificent high C. A real find is the Sparafucile, Georg Zeppenfeld. Remember the name - he will go far. And, from an acting point of view, they are as good as any opera singers ever were. Also, Fabio Luisi paces the orchestra superbly.<br /><br />Now, the negatives:<br />This is one of the most moronic, ridiculous production of an opera I have ever seen. I could not figure out what the director, Nikolaus Lehbhoff, was trying to do by setting the second scene of the first act in Gilda's bedroom and with Damrau being dressed in what appeared to be a white evening gown. Was he perhaps trying to suggest (against everything in the score) that Gilda was a prostitute and Rigoletto her pimp? Also, the courtiers wore masks that made them look like some kind of insects in the second act. What that was supposed to signify only Lehnhoff knows.<br /><br />Hopefully, Virgin will release this splendin performance on an audio CD so that it might be enjoyed without Lehnhoff's distractions.<br /><br />PS: Just last week I saw Lucic perform Rigoletto at the MET, again under the baton of Maestro Luisi. Hard to believe, but he may have sung even better at the MET and Maestro Luisi even made the 2 minute prelude sound like an opera all by itself! Again, superb singing and acting from a great baritone!

B004HU6YZ4|5.0|This is great, I was not sure if there was going to be another Social Distortion album and here it is. It sounds just like Social Distortion and Mike Ness to me and that is a good thing, just what I would expect from them. This album is very rock'n'roll and has a well produced sound. After reading some reviews I do not know what people expected, if you have not listened to them since their first album it may not be what you would expect however if you have listened to them over the years it sounds just like social distortion. You either like 'em or you don't and I like 'em so I am going to go listen to this one again.
B000UE29SW|5.0|I read this book after seeing Betty on a T.V. talk show.  I was so impressed by what she had to say...I needed to know more.  I ordered this book and started to read.  It is one of those books you can't put down.<br /><br />I've always been interested in \\"what's out there\\" and what could possibly \\"lie\\" beyond this world as WE know it.  Do we really die or does the \\"Soul\\" continue to live.  Do we have a purpose here on Earth and WHY do we go through some of the \\"trials and tribulations\\" that we do?  So many unanswered questions.<br /><br />Shortly after reading the book, which gave me sooo much \\"insight\\" into the why's of it all...I lost my son to \\"suicide\\".  This book helped me to deal with the days of depression following this.  The book seemed to erase so many \\"stigmas\\" attached to the word \\"suicide\\" and the very slanted view I'd grown up to believe from people who really had no idea or even \\"right\\" to say some of the things they did.<br /><br />This book will open your mind up to so many possibilities and help you to understand that we choose many of the life events and even people in our lives.  All pre-destined and planned before we come to Planet Earth.  We continue to come back to Planet Earth...over and over again...until we are \\"perfect\\" in the Eyes of God.  Or I guess a better way to say it...is...until WE are satisfied with the way we \\"perfect\\" our spiritual growth until we reach a point that we reside permanently in Heaven.  It is \\"our\\" choice whether or not we want to come back.  Some choose not to.<br /><br />This is a thought-provoking book.  I would highly recommend it, moreso to someone who has suffered a \\"loss\\" and could benefit from the quiet \\"relief\\" you will get from the knowledge it contains.  I've shared this book with others, even a family member who lost a daughter.  Not through suicide, but the pain is still the same.  It gave her \\"peace\\" of mind...to continue to Live.  The best present you could give yourself or a friend who is struggling to come to terms with a loss.  Many times being \\"angry\\" with God and not understanding WHY?  Read...find out why and I think if you have an open mind...you will come away a \\"new\\" person in your feelings and your actions.Many times being \\"angry\\" with God and not understanding WHY?

B001UV4XI8|5.0|As any fan of the books know, this is a much darker part of the story. As such, so is the movie. The director picked the perfect cutoff to begin the next movie - CLIFFHANGER!!! The movie, as usual, stays true to the book. Little Harry, Ron and Hermione are definitely all grown up. What a fantastic beginning to the end!
B0002S947K|5.0|I saw Ray on a special on T.V.  As soon as I heard his voice...I knew I had to have that CD.  I went online to amazon.com, where I order ALL my music from because you can usually find the best price.  Found the one that had the songs that I really liked the most.    Bought the CD..and I can play it on and on and not get tired of it.  This is a man who sings from his \\"soul\\" and there is something quite \\"unique\\" about his voice.  I don't know if you remember when Rod Stewart came onto the scene with his kinda \\"raspy\\" voice that was so \\"pleasing\\" to the ear.     I think Ray has that same kind of raspiness...just a little more refined.  Without hearing any of the other CD's...this has got to be my favorite.  There is NO song I don't care for.  Each...and every one Wonderful..with \\"TROUBLE\\" being my personal favorite.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I just loved this book - If i could have taken time off work I would have finished it in a day or two. When I was getting to the end I put off finishing it because I did not want it to end.  I was sad when it did - now I have to find a book to replace it..  Please Deborah - please hurry and write next one.  Thank You for writing it & hopefully bunches more..  I love you characters ( all of them ). Is there really a wonderful house like theirs anywhere ????
0670022411|2.0|I would not normally review a book I did not finish, but I feel compelled to put in my two cents.  I listened to about half of the unabridged version on Audible.  This book is about 24 hours long.  I usually count that as a plus.  I really enjoyed the first 1/4 of the book.  Then I felt it started to drag and thought if I has to listen to really long discussions of what the characters tasted and smelled whenever they tried a bottle of wine one more time I was done.  The bad thing about audio books is that you can't skim.  Then I read the one star reviews that said there was no resolution to the plot even if you get to the end.  I perservered.  Now I have come to the point that, like Rhett Butler, frankly my dear, I don't give a ****.

B0038BBA4I|5.0|I, like many people, discovered this when I was flipping through radio stations. I was using a top 40 station as background noise and then Little Lion Man came on and my jaw dropped open. I had never heard anything like this on mainstream radio before. The first thing that caught my ears was the amazing vocals. Finally a UK band not afraid to keep their accents. When I saw the album as a $5.00 MP3 download I grabbed it. I was not disappointed.     I can draw comparisons to several artists: Van Morrison, Dave Matthews Band, Seven Nations, Blythe Power and The Pogues to name a few. Don't let that say anything though. They clearly have developed their own sound.    I could give a track by track breakdown but that has been done so I will break it down this way. The album starts out quietly with Sigh No More and swells into an amazing acoustic storn interlaced with mandolin, banjo and various other bow played instruments. There is not a bad track in the lot and then it mellows back out for the closing track After The Storm. This is one of the best albums I have heard in a very long time.

I bought the first one 1.5 year ago but now some more used buttons are not sensitive at all (like +-=*). I have to press them very hard,, so I bought another one. Unfortunately, as I'm accustomed to use this calculator I cannot change it,,   In conclusion, if it had more durable buttons, it was great!
159102594X|4.0|I'm tempted to give this book 5 stars, but I give that to very few books. If I could give it 4 1/2, I would.    I've been reading/listening to a lot of \\"first\\" novels recently -- and this one strikes me as being more assured, relaxed, and....maybe well-rounded?....than the others I've been going through. The internal lives of the characters are quite exceptional and intriguing. Even though the main characters are emphatically not original in type, the author forces us to see them as complex and compelling individuals. Also, it's pretty easy to see ways in which Abercrombie's extensive film experience has shaped the story, the cuts he chooses to make, and his visual descriptions. I'm very impressed by his narrative voice in general, and that's an important part of what lets me enjoy particular authors and not others. Sure, the plot may not be in a big hurry to get anywhere in particular -- but as other authors (e.g. Jordan) have proved, there is much more to good books than frenetic pacing.    Also -- if you choose to buy the audio version of this book, I can report that Steven Pacey does a wonderful job at the narration. Although as a non-Brit I can't tell how authentic any of his various accents may be, his voicings seem very well thought out and definitely help to add even more depth to the characters.     I am now listening to the second book in this trilogy, and I'm enjoying it just as much as the first. Ignore any reviews that make it sound as though these books are all blood and guts -- there's much much more to them than that. If you enjoy extensive characterization and you can cope with multiple viewpoints, then you really ought to give these books a try.
0061537969|2.0|While we all love dogs and enjoyed Enzo's observations and the author's descriptive talents, we felt that the themes of perservance and loyalty could have been pursued in much more engaging and less dark and depressing ways. The author is obviously clever and creative, but the storyline of the wife and the girl were offputting to the point that several members did not finish it.  At the end of the day we could not understand why it had gotten so many good reviews.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I really like my G930 headset.  I have been using it for a couple months now and overall find it to have been a good buy.    PRO:  -Sound quality is good and the 7.1 works well for a headset.  -Microphone is very good at reducing backgroud noises broadcast and is clear and crisp when speaking.  -Good range.  I can sit out in the back yard on a sunny day listening to music or talking to friends in vent with no issues. So the advertised 40ft range seems about right in my situation.   -Long USB cord for when you need to recharge.  I have had to recharge while using them at my desk and while I would not mind another foot for so considering the way I have it setup I am satisfied.  -Battery life.  I tend to be able to get about 8-10 hours stright wireless freedom when they are fully charged. I have not had any times where I intend to use them for longer then this that I am not at my desk for part of the time and can just hook them up to charge a bit while still using them.  -Comfort.  At first I found them a bit uncomfortable compared to my old headset but after about a week I must have worn them in a bit becuase now I find them to be very comfortable to wear around for extended periods.  -Sound isolation.  I can barely hear anything but what is coming through the headset.  Good except when someone starts talking to me from behind and I cannot hear them at all.    Con:  -Weight.  A little heavy but overall not so bad that I feel strain in my neck while wearing them.  You will know that they are there though.  Only a slight con imo.  -Durability. After three months of daily use the plastic that  connects swivels  for the left ear cup cracked totally in half just above the G1 key as I took them off.  Considering the price of this headset I was quite disappointed as I had not felt I had been abusing them in anyway in which this should have happened.  A couple zip ties and it is good as new and even though the zip ties have fallen off a time or two and left it hanging a bit the headset is still completely usuable as long as I am careful till I throw a couple more zip ties on.  I plan to use some super glue on the plastic in the near future to see about making this a more permanent fix.  If I have any more issues like this though in other areas though in the near future I am not going to be happy.    *8/12/11 I have super glued the the broken plastic back together and have found that worked well as long as I leave the zip ties on there too which does not bother me in the least. No further issues relating to durablility so at the price this headset is available at now I would certainly recommend them.*

This book is super fancy and heavy with hundreds of glossy pictures.

If you like his artwork, you should buy this.
B0039PPW60|5.0|I bought this a few months ago for my basement studio. I'm am so glad I bought this mixer. The FX are great and I love how all of them are adjustable. The USB definitely saves time on recording and editing. There is one bad thing about it: for some reason when you have headphones plugged in to the mixer and the mixer plugged in to the computer, and the computer headphones also plugged into the mixer (best way to do overdubbing and different tracks) then there is some slight interference noise not a lot depending on your recording software, but just enough to get annoying after two hours of working on a song.<br /><br />Overall I could not be happier with this mixer. Especially the phantom power, which allows you to use condensing microphones.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I debated back & forth on whether or not to buy this show because I do not have cable so I've never seen it before & because of the price... I thought that $36 was expensive for only 12 episodes, but I sure am glad that I decided to buy it!!! This show is great, very entertaining... wasn't what I expected at all! Still wish there were more episodes though. It has action, romance, murder, mystery, cool & interesting characters, but it is definitely not for kids. Lots of cursing & nudity involved, but that is one of the reasons why I like it! lol It's different. I just finished watching seasons 1-2 & am fixing to order season 3, I am completely hooked!! I hope this show sticks around for a long time.
0061537969|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK.  A beautiful story of unconditional love and understanding.  I so enjoyed the story being told by Enzo, and his view of the human condition.

0307595862|4.0|\\"The Snowman\\" is Jo Nesbo's most recently translated novel in the Harry Hole detective series.  While Oslo, Norway, is not the first place you'd think to set a murder-detective series, Nesbo does an amazing job of making Oslo seem much more dangerous than it really is.  While many of the characters in the book mock Norway, the country also comes out in a new, positive, and exciting light too.<br /><br />The Snowman is a thriller that became harder and harder to put down.  The \\"love\\" scenes and sexual references, especially at the very beginning, are a bit annoying at times and apropos, but overall the writing and pace are excellent.  While much of the plotline is a bit unrealistic, what thriller isn't?  Harry Hole and most of the characters are hard to like, but that made them ultimately more enjoyable for me.  Ultimately, the resolution of the book turned out to be very different from what I expected and gave me a lot of respect for the author's imagination.  While Nesbo has stated that he doesn't want films to be made of his books, at times I did feel like The Snowman was destined to be made into a movie.<br /><br />The book could use a bit better copy editing and/or translating.  Obviously, a book set entirely in Norway and with nearly entirely Norwegian characters is goinng to contain numerous Norwegian references that most people would not be familiar with.  For example, \\"skal\\" the Scandinavian equivalent of \\"Cheers!\\" is not translated, nor is \\"froken\\", which means Ms..  I know that the translator is British and obviously there are some dialectal differences between the US and UK versions of English so some awkward wordings and phrasings may simply be British dialect.  But at times the writing had the feel of being a translated work due to awkard phraseology and sentence structures.  Also, while footnotes with cultural explanations and definitions can get annoying, I think that some better descriptions of uniquely Norwegian phenomena (e.g. the high school graduation \\"russ\\"), and translations of Norwegian words that are kept untranslated (I couldn't figure out why they were left in) would help make things a lot clearer for readers, as much of the book's content is lost on anyone who isn't very familiar with Norway.<br /><br />The ubiquitous comparisons with Stieg Larsson are irrelevant, inaccurate, and largely based on a lack of careful thought.  Yes, both are Scandinavian crime-thriller novel writers.  But the similarities end there.  The characters and plots of the Millenium series have no connection to Nesbo's Harry Hole series.  Do not buy this book simply because you loved Larson's books.  In fact, I'd say Nesbo's books are more appropriate for someone who likes detective/thriller novels generally rather than simply the \\"Scandi-crime\\" fad.<br /><br />If you like thrillers, detective novels, and/or Norway, you'll enjoy \\"Snowman\\" and the Harry Hole series.and translations of Norwegian words that are kept untranslated (I couldn't figure out why they were left in) would help make things a lot clearer for readers, as much of the book's content is lost on anyone who isn't very familiar with Norway.

B004KSQN7C|5.0|From the first to the last track, Femme Fatale just blows my mind away every single time that i've listen to it! (09/10)    It's just amazing to listen to the different and brilliant ways that Britney's vocals sound each track, showing how versatile she can be. What is also amazing are the instrumentals, so well produced by the creatives Dr. Luke and Max Martin and others producers that worked on this, taking it to the next level, baby! Femme Fatale is an excitingit-non-stop-dacingin album that you can't miss, it just sounds like a 2020 Greatest Hits Album bringing us only the BEST of Britney Spears.    track-bytrack review:    1 - \\"Till The World Ends\\" - (10/10) - Almost impossible not to dance and sing along. Club Anthem of 2011.    2 - \\"Hold It Against Me\\" - (09/10) - One of the most alternative pop songs she's ever made, with a breathtaking dubsetp-based break, taking it to the next level. Runner up for Club Anthem of 2011.    3 - \\"Inside Out\\" - (09/10) - An almost possessed Britney asking to be \\"turned inside out\\" with one of the best vocals i've ever listened to.    4 - \\"I Wanna Go\\" - (10/10) - Looks like a David Guetta's #1 hit, but better! (If you're wondering \\"What could be better than a #1 hit?\\", the answer is Britney Spears!)    5 - \\"How I Roll\\" - (09/10) - The most creative song of Femme fatale, this instrumental is so much fun to listen to. It's fresh, creative and fills you up with joy.    6 - (Drop Dead) Beautiful (Feat. Sabi) - (10/10) - This is the right song for the real Femme Fatales around the world. Spears insane vocals absolutely take this song to the next level.    7 - Seal It With a Kiss - (09/10) - Another one that fills you up with joy, the bustep-inspired break is even better than the one on Hold It Against Me.    8 - Big Fat Bass (Feat. Will.I.Am) - (10/10) - The most addictive track of the entire album. Will.I.Am is just a genious. Gotta love it!    9 - Trouble For Me - (09/10) - A sexy and sassy Britney asking for trouble! Together with\\"I Wanna Go\\" and \\"Big Fat Bass\\" they made the Eletro-Pop momento complete.    10 - Trip To Your Heart - (10/10) - An up-tempo synth-pop romantic lullaby from 2020! One of THE BEST tracks os the album.    11 - Gasoline - (08/10) - Britney's hot and everybody knows it! Been there, done that...    12 - Criminal - (08/10) - Looks like it doesn't belong to Femme Fatale (it'd be better on In The Zone).    13 - Up n' Down - (09/10) - Addictive lyrics make this song great, one of the reasons you should by the Deluxe Edition.    14 - He About To Lose Me - (07/10) - The ugliest vocal on Femme. Even tough the lyrics are catchy, this is the only track os Femme Fatale i didn't like.    15 - Selfish - (09/10) - A develish, mean and rich Britney inviting us for a ride on her Mercedes? Gotta love that!     16 - Don't Keep Me Waiting - (09/10) - Like \\"Rock Boy\\" and \\"I Love Rock and Roll\\", this is Rockstar Britney! I think she sould consider working on a Rock album... It'd be amazing!
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|I felt the military was covered well. Occasionally the group fleeing the monster encounter military personal fighting the beast and in their utterances we get an update on what's really going on, the big picture. It was probably unrealistic though, or at least some parts of it were unrealistic. 6 hours after Godzilla drops, M1 tanks (our main battle tank) and even heavier artillery pieces are fighting in Manhattan? Didn't earlier in the movie it show one of the bridges into Manhattan being destroyed? Perhaps it was possible. . .<br /><br />It was only after the movie was over, thinking about it, that I realized what the movie was about (odd that I give a movie I don't understand 10 stars, but I do - I think my date liked it as much or more than I did). I think Cloverfield is about the bravery of the characters. Each character in the movie is braver than I would have been but it is believable.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I've finished this game on my Epic 4g and never had a Force Close.  The game is great with excellent puzzles and graphics.  (I have to admit I had to resort to hints available on the net a couple times to get past a couple of the puzzles.)  I like the fact that I could leave the game at any time and come back days later to the same spot (again, with no issues.)  The ONLY reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish it was longer.  The &quot;ending&quot; was somewhat of a letdown for me.  I definately hope the developer will put out a sequel soon! (I'll try not to jump to internet hints as quickly the next time.)

B004TJ1H3C|5.0|Season 1 wasn't that good, but season 2 was great - there is only one problem. There is no end? Season 2 stops \\"in the middle of the story\\" - MGM cancelled season 3 and further movies, regardless what people outside the United States are thinking. I hope that MGM will change their decision, otherwise: Shame on you - MGM => I'll have to cancel my Syfy abonnement!
B004DK5CW4|4.0|I am an avid horse racing person completely familiar with the history of the horse. I went expecting a professional modern movie that took liberty with the truth, but came away surprised. While the woman-against-the-world theme was a little overdone, it had a basis in fact. The rest of the movie was expertly done, and the director/cinematographer team was very careful to minimize the number of gotchas that could have resulted from using real present day settings for backdrops.        Mr. Horton's review misses some points. The Chenery family DID face a huge estate tax burden that would have sunk her family below the filthy-rich category that he laughably stereotypes her with. If there was a villain, it consisted of a system of confiscatory, predatory tax laws, and the movie didn't dwell upon it enough. In addition, he missed the 70s, or he would have known that the \\"Christian\\" music that was chosen was actually popular top-40 that made up \\"soul\\" genre of the time. I'm not 100% sure, but the director seemed to connect it with scenes of the groom, Eddie Sweat, on whose book some of the story is based. For all I know the music could have been some of his own inspiration during the low moments and thus faithful to the past. I should check, and so should have Mr. Horton.       All in all, it is a well done for a racing-based, sports-based movie, most of which turn me off. I would have done some things differently, but the quality went well beyond my expectations. 4 3/4 stars.
0805209999|4.0|Clearly, \\"The Trial\\" by Franz Kafka is essential reading for anybody who is serious about literature and understanding modern society.  As a bureaucrat myself, I should be offended by the entire premise of the book, but I can appreciate the harm that can be caused to people by the combination of a totalitarian state run by a faceless bureaucracy.<br /><br />In this particular translation reviewed here, please beware that in the translator's preface to the novel, he gives away the entire (surprise) ending to the story. Being a first-time reader, I was not amused, as he spoiled the sudden, rather abrupt and dramatic ending for me.<br /><br />No need to go into the plot here, as it is apparently well-known to most people who read.  The writing is surprisingly absurd, as he invents surreal events that could not happen in real life.  In some ways, he was on the early cutting edge of the Dadaist movement championed by Dali and other artists. Also, although the story itself is genius, the actual writing is often difficult to get through, because it does not flow well.  Perhaps it is a function of the translation, but I found the actual language to be less than poetic.<br /><br />Kafka was one paranoid dude, with a seemingly genuine fear of government which I do not share (I think corporations have much more power over the average person than the government does these days.) Nevertheless, as a Jewish person in Germany in the 1920s, I guess you could say Kafka's paranoia over the government was well-justified, given the terrible events that were to happen shortly. Anybody who can even conceive of the basic story of \\"The Trial\\" must have been a very unhappy camper indeed.
B003L77GGK|5.0|The beginning of the season was a bit weird, but it was still really good and interesting. I thought it was a good storyline and worth catching up too because I started watching from season 1 about 3 weeks into the beginning of season 6. The second section of the season is great! The plot twists were absolutely amazing, and I really got into the episodes. Cannot wait for season 7!
1603580557|5.0|I'm not a systems expert so I found this very useful and comprehensive.  I especially appreciated her humbleness and frankness as she noted that this is just a model of life, not life itself, and that it is a lot easier to model a system than change it.  Also, the fact that all systems are interconnected means that where you draw the boundaries is arbitrary.  The more she spoke about systems, the more Buddhist systems theory became, but I'm not sure that was her intention.  It is just that the teachings of the Buddha on interconnectedness seem to be at the heart of systems theory.  Very glad I bought it.

B004N44SOI|4.0|I had given up on all things associated with Motley Crue some years back, so I was floored by the last Sixx:A.M. effort of the Heroin Diaries Soundtrack.  I spread that album recommendation around like wildfire.  I still would have that album on my \\"desert island\\" list.  This effort has some good moments, but did not have the incredible impact that I was hoping for.  We all hope, pray, wish that pinnacle work can continue, but this one fell little short.  The superfans will still love it, but for the rest of the crowd it will be hit or miss.  I bought it sound unheard and am having a little buyers remorse to be honest.  Shame on me I guess.  Give the samples a listen, see if you like it.  I think that tracks  1 & 2 are tops, and that 5 & 7 are the bottoms.  Everything else falls someplace in between.

B004TB6GUY|1.0|I was hoping for a Book of Shadows II but disappointed.  Saw Zakk in the UK recently, all 1hr 20mins of him. No talk just grunge. The sound system wasn't good and Zakk didn't perform to a standard that was expected. It seemed like 'just another day at the office'.  I was hoping to be brought back into the Zakk fold by this new release but he has missed yet another opportunity to shine as not only a songsmith but as a singer too.  The song 'Sold My Soul' rings very true. Zakk is now in it for money, has to be.   Mainstream wasn't a word that I would normally associate with Zakk and the boys but that is exactly what they are.  So sad.  Listenable album but not a memorable one.  Come on Zakk, you are a talented man. Show the world what you can do. Be honest.

B004SC8YH2|5.0|I have been a Christopher Cross fan since I heard \\"Never Be The Same\\" off his debut album over 30 years ago.  Enthusiastically, I have kept up with his career, looking forward to each release with great anticipation, knowing that I would not be disappointed.  The years have gone by and, release after release, I (and all those lucky enough to have all of his music) have been treated to brilliant singing, song writing, and flawless production.  And to my expected delight, DOCTOR FAITH claims its rightful place amongst the wonderful catalogue of Cross classics.  13 years since his last album of new material and WOW was it worth the wait!!!  \\"November\\" is a lovely ballad reminding me of the emotions I felt the first time I heard his classic, \\"Swept Away\\", off of 1988's BACK OF MY MIND disc.  And Cross' voice has not lost a beat...it is as smooth and as beautiful as ever!    Cross and his long time writing collaborator, Rob Meurer, deliver a great variety here, ranging from the before-mentioned \\"November\\" to the upbeat and catchy \\"Leave It To Me\\", which would be perfect on a sunny trip to the beach.  Crisp, clear vocals, pristine musicianship, and mature, thought-provoking lyrics make this cd a treasure for the ears.  I am confident you will be hooked...I know I am!
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This bag has ample space for my Nikon D90 with all of the extras. I have a couple of lenses, the body, several filters, and loads of other things.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Considering it won't have the original versions, this is already not a set that we'd all really look forward to that much.  However we already knew we weren't getting the originals.  But what makes this set such a sad 'cash grab' is that it lacks vast amounts of extras that we were promised by Lucasfilm.  It's missing Empire of Dreams (the best documentary on the OT), The Legacy Revealed (mythological and philosophical take on the saga), and several other very profound documentaries/features on the saga.  Instead we get some awful documentaries on the 501st Legion (the cosplaying fanbase) and a documentary on the mostly terrible changes to the OT in the special editions.  While the old making-of documentaries are included, as well as deleted scenes, these only make up several hours of the supposed 40 hours of extras.  There has been no word STILL on whether any additional work has been done to correct the issues in the 2004 SEs (such as color correcting, etc.).  It seems they've stuck with the god awful transfers from 2004 and decided not to spend a dime on upgrading them.  Look forward to most likely seeing Vader's pink lightsaber again.  On a final note, the box art is atrocious.  While this is very minor, it's strange they went with such a poor (and poorly received) art designs.  This set keeps getting worse all the time.    UPDATE:  The news of the further edited films made me edit my review score.  The SE films were already tampered with poorly but this has gone too far.  I'm utterly refusing to buy these sets ever.  My last sentence in this original review rang truer than I'd ever hoped or expected.  Stick to the previous DVDs, Laserdisc, and VHS tapes.  Better yet, contribute to the Star Wars Revisited Saga Project by Adywan.

B00474IVGA|1.0|If you want the songs from the movie, buy the second album - [[ASIN:B004KZPUTC Country Strong (More Music from the Motion Picture)]].  You will get more of Garrett and Leighton's music, and it is only 5 dollars to download, which makes it a hell of a deal.  I like that the cute song, \\"Travis\\" is on there too.  Love Gwyneth's singing as well, but my heart and ears belong to Garrett.  Faith Hill's \\"Give in to me\\" sounds so much better as a duet, and Garrett's deeper voice puts Trace Adkins \\"Timing is everything\\" to shame.

1847879071|5.0|The colloquial speech makes this book feel friendly and puts a smile on your face when reading. The reader is given the feeling that nothing is kept hidden from him or her thanks to the straightforward language. The coexistence of elaborate technical definitions is what makes this book exciting.   Perfect for self-studying statistics.  One minor defect is that although the examples given in chapters are original and inspiring, the absence of common, typical examples might be an issue to be considered before acquiring this book as a statistical reference, especially for major scale class use.
B001AFF25W|5.0|This book not only helped me with my personal business but it also gave me insight into my personal life and ideas on parenting and running my household (I'm a single mom and getting everything done each day used to be a struggle....now it's just a challenge LOL).
1593080778|3.0|I figured while I was on my evolution book kick, I might as well go back to the original (well sort of the original,  Alfred Russel Wallace published a paper on natural selection which prompted Darwin to publish this \\"abstract\\").  Now that I'm finished I feel two different ways about the book, a loved yet bored type of feeling.  First I'm amazed at just how much of Darwin's theories and ideas are accurate and accepted even today 150 years later (which is a pretty darn long time in science).  One thing you have to appreciate about this book is that its pretty evident that Darwin didn't just rush out and publish this theories but thought about every possible question everyone could have and he attempts to answer them all.  Another question he spends a lot of time on is how flora could make it to islands, he goes through page after page of experiments trying to see how long seeds can stay in salt water and still germinate. Even better way back 150 years ago Darwin already anticipated the irreducible complexity argument of the eye and  proposed his own ideas about how the eye could evolve and how each gradation is useful in itself.   Some times the prose was pretty amazing, I think the famous line about \\"There is grandeur in this view of life.....\\" is one of my favorites in any book I've read.    So as amazing as some parts where why then did I rate it 3 stars?  Well for every amazing part there are page after page of material which is (to me) just plain boring.  The prose which is great in sections is pretty tedious in other parts.  The fact that he thought of every question means that he goes over proof after proof.  Remember the salt water and the seeds mentioned above, well its cool at first but 40 pages  of his experiments makes me start to care less and less.  There were also a few parts which he got wrong, he spends a whole section trying to figure out why certain animals can't cross breed, something which is quickly addressed now days with DNA.  I think at another part he denies that there ever were any mass extinctions (something we know happened several times in the earth's history).  Another thing which made the book a little harder for me is Darwin mentions lots of people and animals I've never heard of, of course a better reader would have spend time looking them up but I just read on, I guess I didn't care enough to do that much research for the book.      So overall for importance I'd rate this book a 5/5, but I have to factor in enjoyment and I so its gets the lower score.  Truthfully this book is 150 years old and written in Victorian English, its very important, but there are better books on evolution out there, so if you're curious about the fascinating world of evolution, start elsewhere, only if you're curious about how the theory got started pick this one up.
0812973992|3.0|Let The Great World Spin is a good book, but it ultimately left me somewhat unsatisfied.  Like most books that don't follow a single narrative, but rather jump back and forth between characters and plots, it does not provide great character development - just as you get to know a character, you lose them and get a new one. Yes, the stories are all overlapping, but none of them feel quite finished. However, I will say that I very much enjoyed the book for the most part and had trouble putting it down. I can't see myself recommending it to a friend, though, as there are a lot of better books out there. Sorry Mr. McCann!
006441034X|5.0|This book is a great read for nearly any age. Written before the movie, it has elements of fantasy & magic while still addressing personal relationships and has a great ending. It would make a nice family read at bedtime.
0307454541|2.0|I wanted to find out what all the fuss was about. Larsson's debut novel and the two sequels that were published either simultaneously or else in rapid succession have topped Best Sellers lists for what feels like forever. As happened previously to me with the first Harry Potter book and The DaVinci Code, curiosity won out. I was unable to let the cult phenomenon pass me by. As you can tell by my 2-star rating, I was not overwhelmed when finally getting around to reading The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. I think it's worthy of a 2.5 star review, but that not being an option I chose to round down rather than up. If the series of books had not each sold a gazillion copies perhaps I would have rounded in the other direction. But bottom line is that I've given 3-star reviews to many books that were superior to this one. The character this novel is named after is its strength, even if the story is not primarily about her. Her distinctive personality and outlook set her apart from cookie cutter characters to be found in many genre titles. But the writing was mediocre at best and as for the plot, it's engaging but by no means tremendously original. This is a whodunnit, but the ending is not especially difficult to guess at least partially if not completely. I don't even consider myself a particularly strong follower of clues in mystery novels, but one does not need to be Nostradamus to make accurate predictions here. I'm by no means trashing the book. It's fairly engaging and certainly easy to read. But my verdict is that unlike many, I don't feel compelled to read parts 2 & 3. I can wait until the inevitable movie adaptations hit cable.

Thank you,  Josette Stauffer
1936594390|3.0|I knew what this story was about long before finally reading it. That's probably common. The famous premise is a fascinating one, though I found myself wondering if the narrative would have been even more impactful if written as a short story or novella length rather than stretched out to a full novel. The Lord Henry character who serves the purpose of putting bad ideas in Dorian's head gives multiple speeches throughout detailing his hedonistic world view. If the number or word count of these lectures was cut in half I don't think the story would suffer much from the absence. Another decision made by Oscar Wilde was not to show readers very much of Dorian's behavior. His first act of cruelty is laid out before us as is his final one, but in between we are only told that his bad reputation precedes him without being shown what he has done to earn it. It's left to our imagination. A few more scenes exhibiting decadent behavior rather than various dinner party conversations in which a pro decadence philsophy is expressed would have made for a juicier read. Would it have made for a better read? That's arguable, as perhaps it also is whether this book is intententially homoerotic or simply written during a time when heterosexual men were much more comfortable going on and on about how good looking a guy was. What's beyond debate is that Oscar Wilde came up with a great idea to build a story around, one that is as timeless as the desire for eternal youth.
B004G5ZXVQ|4.0|Here's where I'm coming from.    R.E.M. is my favorite band of all time. I've been buying their albums since the early 1980s, but after Bill Berry left the band, I've found some of the albums to be nearly unlistenable. R.E.M. was threatening to join U2 on the list of \\"bands whose albums I used to buy.\\"    Accelerate was an improvement. Collapse is better than Accelerate. I'm listening to it about once a day, and half of the songs are stuck in my head.    If you're a longtime fan, give it a shot.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|I'm not one to write reviews for anything. I either like something or I don't. And this is my first review for an album. But this album was so moving that I thought I had to say something. I usually listen to alternative rock, trance or vocal trance depending on where I am and my mood. However, this was the first time I thought I would try a different genre . And ever since I downloaded this album I have been listening to it over and over. Seriously. I simply cannot stop listening to it. Whatever my mood, listening to this brings me up many levels. I have always been more of a instrumental type of music listener and this fit my tastes very very well.
0810993139|1.0|I have a 8 yr old reading at a 6.5 reading level but would not allow this book to be read. It is filled with inappropriate jokes and name calling. I understand that bullying is getting worse in our schools but I would contribute that to books like this. Some kids may relate but it is vary disrespectful and rude humor.
0375701427|5.0|A fascinating and beautifully written novel about the surface of our lives that we present to the world, the layers of truth that lay hidden beneath, and how the sum of these parts fails to add up to who we are. I would say more but this masterpiece speaks beyond powerfully for itself.
B00005V9IK|3.0|So I'm a little slow sometimes.  I watched Independence Day the other day for the first time in years, and finally noticed that the invading aliens were a metaphor for mankind despoiling and stripping the earth.  Jeff Goldblum's scientist character is one of those nags constantly pestering people to pick up their pop cans and rattling on about saving the earth.  And there are the aliens, here to take earth's riches, just like we humans are doing now.    The movie's green obsession takes it down a spectacularly dumb alley.  When all else fails to stop the invaders, a nuclear strike is ordered up with great reluctance by the doofus president.  The scientist basically has a two-headed cow, because of the havoc a nuclear bomb will unleash.  Mind you, the aliens have already wiped out a couple of hundred million humans at least, and everyone knows after the alien/president mind meld that the invaders will strip earth of everything it has anyway.  But the scientist whacks out nonetheless.  Better mankind should die for nothing than that it make a mess defending itself.    The president joins in this nonsense.  (Giveaway alert, if you have no idea what happens in the movie.)  When the nuclear cruise missile attack fails, he simply gives up and refuses a mass attack of serious proportion.  Now this makes a lot of sense.  Facing certain defeat and extinction of humanity, and knowing exactly what the invaders have in mind (remember the mind meld?), the president just calls the whole thing off as the spacecrafts go about their business erasing cities.  I can gladly suspend belief for entertainment's sake, but even a fictional movie must make some sense.    I.D. had state-of-the-art special effects (in its day), solid acting, humor, and action.  It's fun to watch.  It's just that it makes no sense at crucial junctures and pushes a preachy message at the same time.  An entertaining movie with a few serious brain-dead parts.
0525951652|3.0|I am a great fan of Mr Follett and have read Pillars of the Earth and World Without End numerous times.  I greatly anticipated Fall of Giants.  I was mildly disappointed.  It is a great story.  I learned a lot about the WW I era.  But I just did not quite find it the page turner of his other work.<br /><br />Will I buy the rest of the trilogy.  For sure.  But Fall will not make it to my favorite novels shelf.
1401300529|5.0|Wow!  What an excellent read this was.  I was looking for a good book on the Korean War, and \\"The Coldest Winter\\" does not fail in that regard.  It describes all the major battles, the politics and personalities surrounding the conflict in good detail.  While this book does not go into finite details of each battle, it definitely gives you a good appreciation for what happened, particularly during the first year of the War.  Having personally been to Korea, and seen the De-militarized Zone (DMZ), I can testify to the impact of the war more that 55 years later.  It is an amazing place, and far too few Americans understand what happened there.  The conditions for the men fighting and dying there were horrible.  We must remember this war, especially as many of its veterans are now dying in their old age.  Some of the best aspects of this book are the description of the politics and personalities.  Much has been written previously about the relationship between Truman and MacArthur, and this book too does a good job describing that relationship as it deals with Korea.  But the book goes farther into other characters of the War - Mao, Kim Il Sung, General Peng, General Almond, Dean Acheson, and many others.  Their stories collectively offer an excellent perspective into the War.  Other key parts of the book describe the rise of the China lobby, the conflict between Republicans and Democrats, McCarthyism, in the debate of China entering the war.  I highly recommend this piece of literature as an homage to the many U.S. servicemen who fought there.
B00006F7S4|5.0|The best album I have heard in the last 10 years.  Simply amazing. I have listened from beginning to end more than 100 times.  This is a must own.
B003L77FYS|5.0|If you like the old Howard Hawks screwball comedies, you'll love the dialogue. If you love crime drama, it'll keep you guessing (sometimes I'm still thinking it over AFTER the episode). If you like family moments, they're in there. And if it's romance you seek, well... it has that too. This is one of the most well written shows I've ever watched, full of great one-liners and profound subtext. And the entire cast does so much with each of their characters. No wonder it has such a loyal fan following. It's thoroughly entertaining, and definitely worth your time and money.
B00338QENI|4.0|I can understand the criticisms offered by some of this popular work; however, I liked it.  Rebecca Skloot is a good writer, and this is a story that needed to be told.  I think she was as objective as someone in her position could be.  It is not a story about science and medicine alone.  The people, including the children of Henrietta Lacks, were affected by the decisions made by others.  As for why more is not told about Mrs. Lacks herself, little is known about her.  I think the author did a good job of balancing the human story with the medical and scientific research stories.  If you think that money, politics, prestige and ego are not facts in medical and scientific research, think again. At the very least, the family could have been kept informed of the use of Henrietta's \\"immortal\\" cells.
0345349571|4.0|I enjoyed this read, particularly the section on the Plague, its origins and affect on the continent of Europe.  It was told from a French point of view, which was useful to carry the story.  Sections of the book became laborous and tedious.  Overall though, I learned a lot from this book and rather enjoyed it.  It is not Barbara Tuchman's finest work (I reserve that for \\"The Guns of August\\", but it is well constructed.  The greatest challenge is trying to track all the individual characters through the book - as there are so many!
0060899220|5.0|A remarkable and entertaining view for anyone wondering about those who work behind the scenes to make your meal or looking to become one of them. It is done in the true Bourdain style with a straight forward  honest view with a touch of humor. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a interesting read or who is just a Bourdain fan
0756404738|5.0|A great follow-up to The Name of the Wind. Easily my favorite fantasy series today. The author has created a memorable, very likeable character in Kvothe. His story is one I hope extends beyond the rumored trilogy nature of the Kingkiller Chronicles.
B0046LVCEM|1.0|This is about the Kindle version.    I read the book as paperback a while ago, but I lost it when I moved around during the last few years.  It's a great book and I would give it five stars, but the Kindle version is missing all illustrations.  If I could give zero stars, I would - it really ruins it.  Should the publisher put in the effort to include the illustrations in the Kindle version this would be a five star review for sure.
B004LAIU4I|5.0|There are a couple of things that one can count on with Paul Simon.  One is that he will create lyrics that a listener can dwell on for hours and come up with at least a dozen interpretations.  Two is that he is always experimenting, never resting on his laurels, and seeking out new sounds to weave into the music.  When both of these come together at peak form, he creates landmark works.  In recent years, his music was interesting yet somehow the two elements didn't quite click.  So while one could respect the work, it was ultimately music that didn't quite resonate.  With \\"So Beautiful Or So What\\", he got the elements to click for the first time in quite a while, and proves to fans and skeptics alike that he is still a relevant musical genius.    Perhaps more than any of his previous albums, \\"So Beautiful Or So What\\" skillfully weaves elements of Mr. Simon's body of work to this point in his career.  Here, the listener can pick out elements of his Simon & Garfunkel days, his early solo career, his seminal \\"Graceland\\" and \\"Rhythm Of The Saints\\" work, and even the Brian Eno-productions of \\"Surprise\\".  But where those individual works/sounds may not have appealed to a wider audience on their own, they are woven together here in such a way as to be appealing - it seems - to a much wider audience.    The common threads throughout the tracks on \\"So Beautiful Or So What\\" are most obviously spirituality and the possibilities of an afterlife.  The most obvious example is \\"The Afterlife\\", a wry look at arriving in Heaven - which is set up like the DMV - and finally meeting God (Mr. Simon gives a lyrical hat-tip to his oft-stated musical influence, Gene Vincent's \\"Bee-Bop-A-Lula\\").  That thread can also be found in \\"Questions For The Angels\\" and \\"Love And Hard Times\\".  But also sprinkled in are themes of love (such as the catchy \\"Dazzling Blue\\"), a down-on-his-luck veteran (\\"Rewrite\\"), and the madness of the modern world (\\"Love Is Eternal Sacred Light\\").  There is even a seemingly throw-away guitar instrumental, \\"Amulet\\", which is also quite appealing.  The best of Mr. Simon's lyric genius also shines through here; there are elements of introspection, cynicism, hope, longing, bewilderment, and clever witticism.      \\"So Beautiful Or So What\\" has been widely hailed as Mr. Simon's best work since \\"Graceland\\".  If making that general rave, I would say it's probably closer to his best since \\"Rhythm of The Saints\\", in that it is a disc that appeals to the kind of wide audiences that were attracted to those works.  Fans of Paul Simon - both those who have hopped on and off throughout his career, and those who have hung with him through all of his discs to date - should be equally pleased with this disc.  One thing is quite clear: Mr. Simon has composed a disc that, while eminently listenable, also proves that he still has much left in his creative reservoir to write and sing about.  This is the musical genius in full.
B004I2K4DY|4.0|My husband loved the 10th anniversary concert, so I bought this for him.  Although this one is good as many reviewers have commented about, he still prefers the 10th anniversary version.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Mindblowing!  So many awesome songs I can't decide on which I like the most.  Soul, heart and talent are rolled into a music experience that will send chills through your body.  Best 5 bucks you can spend.  The music is original, the sound authentic and lyrics that are meaningful.  This band has given me hope in the music world.
0060899220|2.0|I enjoy Bourdain's show, No Reservations, and finally got around to reading this book, but was unfortunately very disappointed.  While there are some good nuggets of information about the restaurant business in here, they are overshadowed by Bourdain's constant and irritating references to his excessive drug and alcohol use, which he seems to pride himself on in a child-like way.  Also, while I can appreciate some of the tributes he pays to the important influences on his life, the description/stories of some of these people seems to ramble on and are just written in a way that we don't care about any of these ancillary characters.  By halfway through the book, I was just waiting for it to be over.  Stick to watching the show, and pass on the book.  Not worth the time.
B0016BPWNM|5.0|This is just a great movie. I used to watch this movie over and over again when I was a kid. Now I can understand much more about this piece of art.<br />Besides the audio/video quality is just great!<br /><br />If you ever heard about this movie or you have previously watched it I totally recommend you to buy it and play it.
B004KPLVW2|5.0|I won't comment on the movie itself, as we all know it's incredible and way ahead of its time. What I will say is I never imagined this movie could look so good. An incredible Blu-Ray transfer was made. The colors are outstanding. Very little grain. The sound in SO much better than before. I highly recommend this release. If you've never seen Tron before, this would be a great way to experience it.
B000TEMSM0|5.0|Love, love, love this!  this is my go-to CD for a bad mood, a rainy day, when I need energy.  Even my Dominican friend likes this -- and it may be the only thing I own he likes! Guerra is on my continual playlist..
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I think that this Angry Birds game is a nice way to pass the time. I do wish more levels or characters were available for downloading.
B004IQMXD4|3.0|First of all, let me just say - I love this woman. I think she is brilliant and I have loved her for MANY years. At least ONE of her albums stays in my car CD changer at all times and her LP's line the walls of my music room. I've seen her in concert 14 times. Stevie Nicks fans are hardcore and DO NOT like for her to be criticized. I love that about her fans because they protect her. However...    The first four tracks, for me, are fantastic. Others, such as \\"Italian Summer\\" and \\"Everybody Loves You\\" are great as well. However, Stevie has this thing that she did on Fleetwood Mac's \\"Say You Will\\" album where she just seemingly recites poetry to a guitar. I'm not a fan of this style. Its something I'd expect to hear in a poetry bar.     One of my favorite albums in Trouble In Shangri-La, her 2001 album. It was FANTASTIC. Loved it. She rocked. This album just lacks the magic of Bella Donna, Wild Heart and Trouble in Shangri-La. Its no Street Angel, but reminds me more of The Other Side of The Mirror in that it is not her best but it does have some great tracks well worth your time and money. Dave Stewart was a good change for her and I appreciate his style, talent and work here.    Stevie always has credited Lindsey for his work with her in the studio...  However, I LONG for the day when her greatest producer, Jimmy Iovine, collaborates with her again.    Love you Stevie! You will always be The Queen of Rock & Roll!
0307887960|3.0|I haven't read the book yet, but I was surprised how warped it is.  Must have been stored in a damp environment.  Very annoying.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Outstanding lyrics, great singing and wonderful music make this a must have for all the MK fans.  The album is as slickly produced as his recent solo works but has a more country feel and this is reflected in the songwriting.  Emmy Lou Harris also has a great voice and she brings soul to the words, but she seems to more of an after thought rather than a partner.      A vital CD for all MK fans.  Pair this up with the live version!!!
0307887960|2.0|I had high hopes for the Dukan Diet book, but as a person who has been studying health and nutrition for many years, I found the Dukan Diet to resemble the effect of so many diets books placed in the blender and the pieces randomly put into a new book.<br /><br />There are some wonderful insights and information in this book about water, hormones, exercise, and how food digests.  However, there is so much in this book that is not healthy that I just am not impressed.  The recommendation of nonfat dairy, pasteurized egg yolks, zero calorie sweeteners, and pork are just some of the things that annoy me about this diet.<br /><br />There are specific instructions for special cases such as children, extreme obesity, or women in menopause/peri-menopause, but again, I think that the information is incorrect and not as effective as the anti fungal approach with plenty of raw foods is.<br /><br />After reading this book, I would think that Weight Watchers would be just as effective, and mapped out as this is, but of course, you would have to pay to be in that.<br /><br />I have seen much better outcomes using the Hallelujah Diet and Doug Kaufmann's anti fungal approach adapted to a majority of raw foods (not meat) which help replace enzymes in the body and help repair the skin and body.  Also Victoria Boutenko has a lot to offer with the addition of green smoothies to the diet as well.<br /><br />As for this book, I just found too much in it that does not optimize health so I can not recommend it as an eating program but for research or information it is interesting, but that is as far as it goes for me.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Really enjoy this game and can not wait until update reaches me today! So much better than regular angry birds!

B003UESJH4|5.0|The King's Speech is one of my all-time favorite films. In my opinion, both Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush should have received Academy Awards. Although there is some questionable language in the film, which may or may not have actually happened in real life, the powerful lessons taught are well worth considering this as a must-have for both film buffs and history buffs alike. The film was re-released with a PG-13 rating in theaters, but personally I think that detracts from the film's impact. I will watch this film over and over because of its touching, emotion-filled drama. If I could have, I'd have rated it higher than five stars!
B0007TKNIS|5.0|Truly celebrates the broadway musical and does not change the story line at all. Full of a very talented cast and a must have for any musical lover.

B001TODCII|4.0|Parents, if you're tempted to allow your teenagers to travel on their own to Europe, watch Taken before you decide. Today's Europe is a far cry from the romantic picture that many Americans still imagine. Bad things can and do happen to naive teens arriving for an adventure.  Having visited France, the setting for Taken, several times in the past decade, I can say firsthand that this country has been inundated with emigres from eastern Europe, and not all of them are innocents in search of freedom. Organized crime has assumed a new face with new mobsters, and in some cases, the newcomers are more ruthless than the natives.<br /><br />The plot of  Taken centers upon a former CIA agent Bryan Mills, portrayed by Liam Neeson, whose daughter is off on a European jaunt, only to be victimized by Albanians eager to sell her virginal charms to the highest bidder.  Film maker Luc Besson, whose rep was made by  such action thrillers as  La Femme Nikita, ramps up the tension by having the abduction take place during a phone call from father to daughter, during which he coaches her to feed him vital info about the thugs. When one of them picks up the cellphone, Mills warns them to release his daughter or face his considerable, professional wrath. Of course, they blow off his warning. But two days later, he's onto them, and never, ever lets go.<br /><br />Neeson displays his physical side, literally mowing down anyone who stands in his way with an arsenal of awesome martial arts moves and laser-eyed shooting ability. Keep in mind that I normally abhor films with brutal scenes of torture and endless chase scenes. I've recently read a lot, however, about sex trafficking, and have to admit that I was rooting for Mills to turn up the electricity and take out those SOB's. Much of the action is totally implausible, but the crime is so heinous that I don't care. Neeson brings a knife edged, single minded, merciless sense of purpose to this role,  and while the daughter and her mother are mindless social twits, it's hard not to pull for him every hard-won, a** kicking step of the way.al twits, it's hard not to pull for him every hard-won, a** kicking step of the way.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I wasn't able to see this film in theatres when it was released, so rented it a few weeks back from our local video store (one of the few left standing!) for our family movie night. The movie, in my opinion, is just excellent all the way around.  The story is wonderful, the acting from everybody is great, and the look of the movie is beautiful. I even liked the soundtrack, which is not something I usually pay that much attention to! It's clear to see why it won the awards it did.  Colin Firth's acting is impressive; you can tell what King George (\\"Bertie\\") is feeling just by the expression on his face - no words needed. One of my favorite aspects of the film is the dry English wit between King George & Lionel Logue. But, what really surprised me about this film (and why I say it passed the Ultimate Test!) is that my teenagers LOVED it! I was expecting a slow moving film that they would get bored with immediately and then leave the room to go do something else; but they remained interested until the end.  The movie moves along at a pretty decent clip. My oldest said it was the best movie based on a true story he had ever seen.  Since everybody here loved it; we have since added it to our DVD collection and have watched it more than once!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|After I read his work with the Wheel of Time, I decided to pick up a Sanderson original. I was not disappointed. Sanderson creates an interesting, original, and immersive world. I am greatly anticipating more books in this series.
B001SGEUNI|1.0|If you're looking for metal, or even hard rock, this is not what you want.  This band tries to pass themselves off as heavy act, yet the songs remind me of a Shania Twain album, albeit with a faster tempo and slightly more aggressive guitars.  What drew me to listen to this band was the female vocal talent that would have been better placed in a power-metal or goth-metal band.  It seems from the album cover that the band attempts to hype its image just a little excessively.  If you're going to portray yourselves as a metal/hard rock band, make the music catchy.
0440236738|5.0|Talk about super twists and topsy turvy turns, this book starts at a semi-calm trot, coasts through a suspenseful, sometimes terrifying plot, and, just when you think the ends are forming a nice pretty bow, Coben throws in a loop that throws the whole ball of wax into a tailspin.<br /><br />Surrounded by a cast of formidable characters, Will Klein is incredibly likable from the first chapter. Part of his charm is his Bolitar-ish ability to laugh at himself and shamelessly share his weaknesses, fragility, and emotions. Make no mistake, Will's strong integrity and loyalty are sufficient to carry this leading man through a tough journey. In those moments when the courage kicks in, he earns his stripes, because you know it's coming from a real and true place.<br /><br />From the neatly trimmed lawns of the banal suburban streets to the dismally dark hallways in the gritty city's rundown apartments, Coben effectively constructs a diverse world that plays host to an array of individuals, expertly intertwined in each others lives. The story moves swiftly from place to place, person to person, smoothly and easily keeping you in anticipation of the next page. By the end of the story, I was emotional and satisfied. Only at the end did I feel like I truly grasped EVERYTHING, leaving me with the desire to turn back to the first page and start again, from the beginning.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Was really happy with my pre-order of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1, not to mention the fact that it was reduced a dollar by the time I received it so it was really an even more pleasant experience.
B003XRZZFM|4.0|After having been disappointed by the lack of anything truly unique on \\"In Sorte Diaboli,\\" aside from the forgettable cliched concept, I was pleased with \\"Abrahadabra.\\"  It presents a fresh take on Dimmu Borgir's ever-evolving style of metal.  As with previous records, the band makes clever use of symphonic elements without overdoing it.  Welcome with open arms was Garm's guest-appearance, although too brief imho.  Though Mustis' talent was lost, fans will be glad to know that the keyboard pieces rival those of previous albums (I personally was impressed by the work on the song \\"Ritualist\\").  Despite lineup changes, Dimmu Borgir has delivered a more-than-worthy masterpiece that shows they have much life left in them.

B000002H70|5.0|Let me just say that i'm no expert on music. i used to only listen to hardcore gangsta rap (Evil Pimp, KB Da Kidnappa...blah blah blah) and still crave all that ridiculousness every now and again...  growing up...   no i wont talk about my influences at this point, but lemme just say that there WAS some rock and 80's pop in there.   this is my first review tho, so here's goes:    from the VERY beginning.. you can tell something amazing is about to happen. Just the way the music FLOWS! It's just incredible. Carrying you along...like floating...  at least  that's how I felt. Pictures of You, track number 2 ?!  Oh my god...    it starts off the same way, ...serenading you for nearly 2 whole minutes!  Finally...  when Robert Smith comes in it's just.....  .... so perfect.      You're like, \\"...yes.\\"    All i can do is close my eyes and just let the lyrics take me away.      I don't even want to say anything more because the rest is the same.   Love song... almost brought me to tears but I'm at work so..                    I'm usually not one to write reviews, but this cd... I just had to say something.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I first found this movie on Netflix  and after watching it I  knew I had to own it. It touched me personally.  It is the story of a simple friendship between a broken-hearted vacuum cleaner repairman / street musician and a young immigrant single mother who loves to play  piano and sings beautifully.  The actors wrote all the music for the film and this was the female leads first venture into acting.    The fact that it is set in Dublin Ireland first drew me to the film. I liked the music so much I downloaded the soundtrack from Amazon before I bought the movie.   It will make you smile.
0316017922|5.0|I have purchased three copies of this book - one for my library, one for a gift to a new father, and one for my Korean physician to evaluate the section on KAL.    While I agree with some of the previous reviews that challenge its academic credentials, I think it provides dramatic insight into the acquisition of genius. When I was a new father, I was deluged with books descibing \\"how to\\" foster genius in your children. I hope my new-father friend will benefit from its \\"how come\\" discussion.     I plan to use it as outside reading for a course in business communication taught to Korean students. Like other Gladwell books,particularly \\"What the Dog Saw,\\" it provides insight to the Western culture that shapes our communication. It also deals with the differences in status and face that can disrupt communication between Westerners and Asians.

0345529057|1.0|This series starts off strong and I could not wait to get the next book in the series.... until I got book 4.  This last book is so poorly written that many people just gave up on it. I could not get even halfway through this book that was full of juvinile language and completely lacking anything remotely resembling a story. I've read more than one epic series that stalls at certain points, but the 4th book falls flat on it's face. I will not be buying any more books from this guy and I will not recomend this series to anyone. I have never been so disappointed with an author in my life. He claims that what was going to be book 4 had to be split into two books because there was so much to it, but any half witted editor could have easily cut about 90% of the garbage out of this book without doing any damage to the story.
B000O8OTNC|1.0|While I've had some luck with this sharpener on knives with thinner blades, it utterly destroyed the edge on my CRKT Ultima. Sure, the edge is good enough for rough field work, but I would never want to dress out a deer with anything I used this sharpener on. But I guess you get what you pay for. Cheap, lightweight sharpeners with fixed angles(like this one) are a mixed bag. They may work well for some blades, but for most knives that you would use in the field, I would regard them as a last resort. Better than a flat rock you pulled out of a mountain stream, but not by much.
0780622650|1.0|What happened to this movie?!  The special effects were convincing and even advanced and believable.  But when it came to the plot, all we got was a hackneyed view of some metal space spiders out of Battlestar Galactica and a thoroughly unbelievable time-travel sequence, which wasn't necessary in the first place.  Talk about suspension of disbelief, this movie required the science of the impossible!  No reactor, no matter how powerful (and this includes the Jupiter 5 main engine) can be manipulated into producing space/time vortexes!  This would require something on the order of a black hole, not a puny spacecraft.  How about a remake with a believable plot?
B000N0WCLC|5.0|Here is a well-made action/drama movie with a stellar cast and meaningful. What more could you want in a movie, unless you're looking for a mindless comedy to entertain you?  I finally put it on my gift list and got it. Money well spent, and deeply moving.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I can't say enough about this version of Jane Eyre. Although I have to agree with other reviews that they made both characters 'too pretty', I believe that the acting portrayed by Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson is on another level. I have seen every version and read the book many times but this movie still kept me on the edge of my seat until the end to see how it would pan out. Great movie and I doubt there will be another version to top this one.
B000LJAEFG|5.0|This is a great movie. I'm into sci-fi and read tons of books, mostly movies fall flat for me, this one, is good.    If you like sci fi at all, watch it.

0345522478|4.0|I must say I'm so glad I won this book. I had not heard of it before I requested to win it but I dont think I would have even looked twice at it if I didn't win it and need to read and review it. I thought Atticus was a brilliant character. He was level headed, described as incredibly good looking which is always nice, powerful and ready to defend him self and his friends. The other characters were always interesting and engaging. I couldn't wait to see who Kevin would introduce next. Oberon, Atticus' dog is hilarious and his obsession with french poodles kept me laughing. Kevin's writing flowed wonderfully. There aren't a lot of books out there with a male character as the lead and I must say Kevin really pulls it off in making me want to read more. I really enjoyed all the Celtic Mythology. HOUNDED is a wonderful addition to the Urban Fantasy genre and i would recommend it without hesitation. Ive already requested and received the next two books in the series (HEXED and HAMMERED) and cant wait to dive into them.
0345529057|1.0|I already own the books, but thought it would make a nice addition to my brand new Kindle, but not at this price!  I don't care who sets the price, this is too high for such old books.  Wanted to buy the set so I wouldn't have to dig out the dead tree versions, but for almost $36, they can keep the e-version.  I think this publisher needs to talk to Baen on how to price older e-books.    The books are awsome, and looking forward to volume 5.    7/30/2011 Edit  Ok, they are now $30 for the kindle, but still $10 more than the dead tree version.  I will up this review once the prices are even.
0670022411|4.0|I truly enjoyed most of this book. I could tell however, as I was getting near the end, that I was going to be left with many unresolved questions. In fact, not one question was answered. The book does a great job setting up what is to come in the following books, but as a stand-alone, it does not work. I look forward to reading the next two books in what is to be the All Souls Trilogy, but felt let down at the end of this book as it does not resolve any of the conflicts. If you like cliff hangers, you will like this one. The pacing begins to fall off in the last few chapters, but otherwise a good read with a letdown ending. (Unless you want to invest in the trilogy... I will be!)
B004GBIE3Y|1.0|A 1-star rating is being generous.  It's a terribly boring movie that really makes no sense.  The main character is very much the Everyday Man, and you don't need a movie to let you know that life is stressful.  If you've come this far w/o knowing or experiencing that, then maybe you should watch this movie.  I promise, for almost a full 2 hrs, you will be distressed.  I was.  It wasn't funny.  And now I'd like a refund.
0439023513|3.0|In the first book, Katniss was written as an unselfish girl who went to the Hunger Games as a tribute to District 12 in place of her little sister.  This was a selfless act.  Her fighting in the arena and her spontaneous actions were amazing as was her silly flirtations with Peeta and Gale, both of whom were not exactly great catches in themselves.<br /><br />The second book picked up where Katniss left off and cannot stand on its own.  I'd definitely call it a sequel to number one, as it dealt more with the rise of the revolution against the dictatorial Capitol with a president of the rebels using Katniss and she resents it fully.<br /><br />The third book was more of the same, but Katniss spun deeper into her own psychoses, not trusting people, not understanding what they're wanting her to do, not getting the importance of public relations (as the grown-ups do) and seems really, a spoiled brat!<br /><br />Later in the story her friends Gale and Peeta, two boys that vie for her affections, are themselves thrown into confusion as Peeta is somehow captured and brainwashed by the Capitol to kill her!  Her only recourse is Gale.  A man who has his own agenda to perform.<br /><br />The third book (praised by Twilight author Stephanie Meyer, OMG) is rushed, especially towards the last third of the book.  Without giving much away, Katniss is really quite a hypocrite.  She plans on stealing a device and doing her own thing, for example, as she wants to assassinate Snow (the president of the Capitol and Panem) but the person with whom she would steal has himself given her every courtesy and protection.  Then she's conflicted.  \\"I know I should be grateful but....\\"  Most of her dialogue is like this.<br /><br />Another annoying aspect of her dialogue is jumping to conclusions.  \\"He's acting that way because ___________ therefore _________ so I must act thus!\\"  And of course the character is not even close to being or acting that way.<br /><br />The last chapters too don't develop her mother nor her sister all that much either.  There is much tragedy with Katniss and she does not hold up well at all.  Her screaming and thrashing, the constant nightmares, it gets to be a bit much.<br /><br />The ending is not totally satisfying but is a surprise and the surprise was such that made the ending not predictable which I'm thankful.<br /><br />There is a film for the first book coming out soon.  I'm looking forward to it since the first book is really the best.  The whole \\"rebel alliance\\" stuff has been done to death however and made slogging through the third book a rough go.  She's a pawn in a rough game.  At the end, she's still a pawn, just surviving, not contributing.  Is that all?<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Katniss is not the strong female character she started out as in the first book but she is clearly no Bella from Twilight.

There is much tragedy with Katniss and she does not hold up well at all.  Her screaming and thrashing, the constant nightmares, it gets to be a bit much.     The ending is not totally satisfying but is a surprise and the surprise was such that made the ending not predictable which I'm thankful.     There is a film for the first book coming out soon.  I'm looking forward to it since the first book is really the best.  The whole \\"rebel alliance\\" stuff has been done to death however and made slogging through the third book a rough go.  She's a pawn in a rough game.  At the end, she's still a pawn, just surviving, not contributing.  Is that all?     Bottom Line:  Katniss is not the strong female character she started out as in the first book but she is clearly no Bella from Twilight.  There are other strong female characters in the book however that may make the book a worthy addition to any female teenager or young adult library.

031606792X|5.0|Book arrived in new condition as described in product details. Fast prompt and courteous service. I will continue to purchase products from Amazon.com. This is the third order I have placed with them and I am very pleased with all three outcomes.
0399536108|5.0|This book is fantastic.  For me it greatly filled in the some of the gaps from something like 4 Hour Workweek.  Chris comes across as pure and inspiring in his honesty.  I personally loved the concept of competence being our job security, and avoiding people who try to steal our energy - something I'm dealing with quite a bit right now as I've started a second company and am planning world wide relocation.    Ultimately, this book is not just for the hair-brained entrepreneur, the idealistic college kid, the career-less vagabond, but rather everyone in between.  It is a compelling attack on 'common' wisdom, conceptions, and herd mentality.  Personally, I feel that people get scared when you don't follow the default path in life, because they are betting their turn on the merry-go-round on this linear model, and in being your own person you bring up questions of their decisions and logic - something they are uncomfortable with and really don't want to do.  The best thing you can do, is ask why we do anything that we do?  And this book can help you get inspired and stay the course.  But Chris is quick to point out areas that you may want to do things differently than he did, that you may like your life in the suburbs quite a bit and just want to tweak a few areas.  In reading this I didn't feel over-sold or like I might be luck enough to join a elite club or nonconformist - maybe.    I've been on the nonconformist path for a while in other areas of my life, but was really struggling with possibly going abroad - people in my life weren't helping.  I finished this book and immediately took action: I threw at dart at a world map and it landed in Siberia and decided Bangkok sounds nicer, I threw away or donated over 2 dozen trash bags of stuff, and I got my visa application prepared. Oct. 1, I'm heading out (it would be sooner but I'm going to South America for a month this summer). Seriously, Thanks Chris.    What's your dream?
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Wall E was well put together.  If you need to teach a child about love, this is the movie.
030726999X|4.0|I have the large (trade) paperback editions of Dragon Tattoo & Played with Fire, and have been WAITING for the comparable matching edition of Hornet's Nest to be released. I presume the delay in its appearance is the result of the publisher trying to milk as much profit from selling other editions. But I want the look of three matching volumes on my shelf, and refuse to be manipulated into buying a more expensive hardbound copy.<br />So a plea to the publisher: please release a trade paperback edition of the third, that matches the larger paperback editions of the first two volumes!
B0040ZA2D6|5.0|My daughter is a big fan of BTR and was excited to get this album.  She loved it.  A lot of catchy tunes and her favorite is Boyfriend.  She is the one rating this album.  That pretty much says it all.
B002OSXDAU|1.0|As has been previously stated, the Kindle price is simply ridiculous. I love Ayn Rand's work, but will definitely not be buying the Kindle edition.    Penguin, You could have had my $10, Instead you get $0.
B004PGO25O|5.0|This book contains a simple blueprint for doing any creative work.  It also deals with the conflicts that arise when you do the work and how you must deal with them. The quotes, and stories of famous authors and their struggles helps us to see even Melville had to struggle writing Moby DIck. This book is a gem that needs to be read by all. Everyone has an idea or creative endeavor that needs to be brought into fruition. This is the manifesto on how to do it!
B004Q1FDHO|2.0|Continually reboots and locks up this phone. Too bad, decent mindless time waster when it works.  developers need to get this issue fixed because it appears I'm not the only one with this issue
B000SKNIWE|5.0|It is a truly epic documentary. I normally think nature documentaries are rather boring, but the videos they were able to get are at times nail bitingly suspenseful and breathtaking. This is \\"the\\" blu ray to get if you want to show off your new setup.
B002VECMAE|1.0|I bought this DVD based upon the rave reviews that were published when it was first released. OMG! This is the worst piece of garbage that I had seen in years. It was so bad, that I could not force myself to watch the entire movie. I ejected it from my dvd player and promptly threw it out.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|While this book is mainly about solving the mystery of Lisbeth, and our heroine and hero are basically trapped by necessity on the sidelines, this book was my favorite of the trilogy.  Lisbeth is confined to her hospital bed where she has suffered a brain trauma from a shooting, and other injuries.  Blomkvist has little access to her except via a cell phone using some technology that retards detection from others.  Still the writing picks up a third into the book and carries the reader away into a trial for Lisbeth's sanity and reputation.  I found that each book built on the other and became more exciting.
B004TB6GQI|5.0|I love Christina Perri.... Like most people I came to love her heartbreakingly tragic voice in \\"Jar of Hearts.\\" I love her impassioned honesty on tracks like \\"Lonely\\" and \\"Distance\\" I can feel the emotion exuding out of her voice. She is very original in a cookie cutter world of pop and autotune. Her song \\"Penguin\\" is adorable, a song about meeting your soul mate (as penguins mate for life). I find that I like one song on an album and buy the entire thing and realize the artist has only that one good song but not this time. I think her CD is beautiful and I am not disappointed in any of the songs... they were all beautiful. I strongly suggest this album to anyone that has great taste in music and is looking for something new and different!!! As said previously, buy this album and be in for a treat!!!!! Christina Perri rocks!!!!! I love her music and know anyone else will too!!!!!
B004ISVH7U|2.0|The album it's a classic and it deserves that. I have it in vynil, single CD and in two box-sets (Collected Works, The Collection) and since the DVD is BORING, though the package it's nice, I could live without this 40th aniversary edition.
B00509OFE8|5.0|I have been watching this series on Amazon these two seasons and really enjoyed it.  There were ups and downs and there was a lot of criticism.   It was a good ending.
B00466HN6S|5.0|So when I saw the trailer for this movie I was impressed by how E.B. was playing the drums and that pretty much interested me into seeing the movie and so I did. I gotta admit this movie was pretty good, alot of funny humor within, music, and a holiday still focused on. Sure the plot was fairly similar to Alvin & The Chipmunks, but thats because the director who made that, made this, and its an improved version of A&TC cause there's only one character to adore instead of 3, more funnier scenes, and real music that you will enjoy instead of extremely high pitched vocals that make your ears pop!(A&TC). The reason why this movie has critical reviews is because this movie is targeted at younger viewers, all those critics who rated this bad have absolutely no sense of humor! Its a great family flick kids will enjoy, believe me when I was in the theater it was packed with kids!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|The DVD was in perfect condition. It came in the time frame that they said with would. No complaints here!
1594744769|3.0|My daughter and I both read this book. We had differing opinions. She said: \\"It was really good but it just ended out of nowhere. I think there are some pages missing.\\"  I think this book is meant to be the first in a series or trilogy.     I loved the concept but the book never quite grabbed me. I was aware that I was reading 'a book' the entire time. Now maybe I'm spoiled, because I just read another book (\\"Rotters\\") that I thought was stellar. \\"Miss Peregrine's...\\" wasn't bad, it just wasn't great. I agree with another reviewer who said that teens would enjoy the book more than adults.  The story, overall is pretty good. I like nostalgia and have a healthy respect for older generations, so that worked in the book's favor.  Jacob possesses the traits of an interesting main character; likable but not perfect.     What impressed me most about the book was the use of photographs. I did not feel as if there were too many, not did their presence feel 'gimicky'. Though a couple did look photoshopped, most of them look very much like genuine, old photographs. I think I spent more time asking myself 'Where'd Riggs find all these fantastic photos?' than wondering what was going to happen next in the story.     So, overall, it's good but not great. And I guess the one aspect that turns me away is what will endear this title to many other readers: it's the beginning of a series. I am not a fan of series. I like short story collections and anthologies most, standalone novels and novellas second and series a distant third. So while my daughter will likely seek out the second in this series to find out what happens next, I will wish Jacob the best in his adventures (and Riggs the best in his writing) and move on to something else.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|It's my app of choice since they added the amazon cloud storage feature. Way better than my droid x's built in music app.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I used to watch this movie when i was 7-8 years old.... and I just loved it!     In fact, my parents and brother still remember this movie and it brings up all the good memories of the time we used to watch it togehter (yes, we used to watch it over and over again!)... we were also singing along the songes together!    In fact, there is a big differnce in cartoon movies back then compared with today's cartoons.... even though today's movies are of more technology and new innovative ideas, but this classic is just... a classic! Love it a lot!    The quality of this used product was like new!     Totally recommended
0817439390|5.0|I learned quite a bit that I didn't know, and that's after reading a few other books on photography. This is the only one I actually bought.

B00164KYV4|5.0|I got this dvd quicker than I thought I would and it was in great shape. One of my favorite movies, I have already watched it and shared it with a friend!
B004UID2LC|5.0|It works perfectly! What a great app. Big thanks to whoever created it. You can save video or mp3. Sweet.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|Great movie.  Followed book well, but left out the boring parts. Blue-ray, dvd +  digital was a real pleasure, 'cause I can watch it on all my stuff.  Unfortnately ipod download took hours even with my high speed internet.
B000002C2E|5.0|The moment Love Sick starts Time Out Of Mind an overpowering aura takes place. Forget whatever you were doing before you pressed play: Dylan's back. His voice's changed and the words he's singing leave you mesmerized. A dark beauty of wisdom fills the air.<br /><br />Only Dylan could've pulled this off - that's for sure - he's undeniably on a different level. Released late in his career, but nonetheless one of his best albums, one which always renews itself at every listen. You keep picking things up as it makes you feel an array of different emotions... A huge achievement, even for Dylan.<br /><br />On the majestic closer Highlands, he basically takes you on such a trip that makes you beg for more - he leaves you totally hypnotized. The album ends, you look at your stereo and you are a different person. Dylan's vision has just heightened your perception, he's given you the chance of opening a new door in your mind. Faint-hearted listeners not allowed.
B001AXME2S|5.0|I went to see Nickelback during their Dark Horse Tour, and Shinedown was one of the bands that opened for them. They played about four or five songs off this album and my wife and I were hooked immediately. Went home and bought all three albums, and this one is by far the best of their three. After having it in my collection for about a year now this album is still among my favorites. There is a large variety of music here. From good ol fashioned hard fist pumping hard rock to feel good puts-a-tear-in-your-eye music, this album has it all. Not to mention that these guys can play, and the lead singer can sing. I find myself wondering at times if his voice could out do the great Elton John's voice. Lyrics are well thought out and well written to go along with the music. If you love rock music you owe it to yourself to check this album out. Every song in my opinion is fantastic on this album.
B00476SZE6|5.0|I ordered this item expecting \\"new age\\" takes on Celtic folk songs, similar to McKennitt's \\"Bonnie Swans\\" on [[ASIN:B000J233TE Mask & Mirror]].  On the first listen I was disappointed, this having more of an authentic traditional sound, in spite of an electric guitar (among more traditional instruments) on 4 songs.  On the second listen, knowing what to expect, I was over-awed.  I own about 50 Celtic albums.  This quickly became my third favorite of them, after [[ASIN:B0002C7YKA Celtic Christmas Spirit]] & Julie Fowlis' [[ASIN:B001JGB1UM Cuilidh (W/Dvd) (Spec)]].  ([[ASIN:B00004WJ2Z Auld Lang Syne: A Fine Selection of Popular Robert Burns Songs]] is a close fourth).  Most of the music is haunting, especially the spare \\"the wind that shakes the barley\\" & the jigging \\"the star of county down (yes, a haunting jig!).  And yes the titles are in all lower case on the cover.  My biggest complaint is that the lyrics were not included, but the songs are fairly easy to understand.
B001E9641K|5.0|I love the Ticket to Ride games. First one I played was a European one that my brother in law owned. That was so much fun that I had to get my own. I love trains and love snow. When the whole family gets together to play we play the original one but when there are fewer of us I love to play this one. It only supports three players but when 3 is all you have it's much more fun than the larger boards. I love the way they put the snow on everything and the cards are full sized to begin with. I had to buy the full size cards for my original Ticket to Ride game. Have fun!
B004E3XDBC|5.0|The Polar Express, the winner of a Caldecott Award, is a classic in my family! Chris Van Allsburg's vivid illustrations and heartfelt words bring the spirit of Christmas to life. It makes you remember when you once believed in Santa Claus. Van Allsburg's way of combining his illustrations with his descriptive words allows the reader to slip into this world of imagination, curiosity, and fascination. The Polar Express allows adult readers to revert back to their favorite Christmas memory while capturing the fun and excitement of children who read it today. This story offers moral lessons to be learned, such as, it's about giving on Christmas than receiving and about spending time with your loved ones during this time of year rather than worrying about what's under the Christmas tree. In today's society, when Christmas has seemed to become more of financial burden, than a time for joy, it's easy to lose sight of what Christmas is all about. The Polar Express will always remind me!
6305878323|5.0|Can Never go wrong with Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke. I loved this movie when I was a teen. Now I enjoy it even more with my grandchildren.
030746363X|4.0|Bought the book and read it while I was on vacation... Tip #1 Do not read a diet book while you are on vacation. haha.... That said, I'm heading into week two, pants are starting to get looser and people are saying I am looking thinner.  Working out (either gym or running) 2-3 days per week (which is normal for me).  I'm looking to loose some love handles that are ALWAYS there (even at my lightest at 155lbs).   Things are looking great so far.  Food is good, I feel full but not stuffed.  Just finished the New England Tough Mudder Competition in VT this past Sunday in 3h:20m which was awesome.  I just started taking the AGG and potassium and calcium supplements so I am expecting to loose more fat and feel even better!!!!      Ill update this review as necessary.    Cheers! Good luck to all.  (I am skeptical for those who this did not work out for, but every \\"body\\" is different. Nothing will work for everyone)
1597801585|1.0|I really wanted to love this book.  It had all the necessary elements of good sci-fi.  A world not too far in the future, current tech taken to its logical limits, a fast moving and engaging storyline. I was really getting into the story.  Unfortunately, the third chapter contained a graphic and horrible rape of one of the characters.  I didn't need to read that.  You don't need that kind of crap to tell a good story.  Fahrenheit 451 didn't need book porn to make his point.  I tried to stay with the book, but ultimately I decided it wasn't worth it.  Be warned if you pick this up, there is an explicit (and I would give the scene a definite X rating) rape scene.
B004IQMXD4|2.0|Hey everybody! Dave Stewart FINALLY found someone to do another Eurythmics album with him! That's right: Stevie Nicks!   ...  Wait...    I've loved Stevie Nicks for a very long time; loved her ever since I heard Stand Back, and ever since I realized just how talented this woman is! David A. Stewart, on the other hand, is quite a different story. For me, he went in the wrong direction with the Eurythmics after a while. Everyone knows what I mean. So what can we expect from an album that offers BOTH of them? A new Eurythmics album, plain and simple. If you read the liner notes, you'll note that the album is pretty much a lyricist (Stevie) /musician (Dave) album. Really. Plus, Dave adds his (mildly unpleasant) voice to a few tracks, especially some where he's not mentioned as a guest vocalist. So, what else can this be? Unfortunately, when Stewart produces an album, he pretty much RULES the album; in other words, it becomes a collaboration effort as opposed to a producer effort, so Stevie gets lost, pretty much. Fundamentally, from that aspect, it's hardly a \\"Stevie Nicks\\" album. So Eurythmics fans, rejoice.  It doesn't sound like Stevie. Even worse, some lyrics are just awful, like \\"You may be the one\\" which uses double entendres to negate the exact same statement. A brilliant thought, except it's absolutely stupid sounding e.g. \\"You may be the one/but you'll never be the one\\". And from the first single \\"Secret Love\\": \\"oooh-wee\\". ...Really? Also, dedicated Stevie fans will get quite a few jolts in their ears, because in many songs, you can hear old lyrics reused. I did. Take, for example, Soldier's Angel, which goes \\"No one walks away/From this battle\\", which is from \\"Battle of the Dragon\\". Don't worry; there are plenty more \\"shout-outs\\" to old songs from the new songs here.  Truthfully, this sounds incredibly uninspired, which is VERY UN-Stevie Nicks. However, she praises it, calling it her \\"Rumours\\". Well, if she wants rumors to start, then yeah, this is her \\"Rumours\\".   I knew it would end up being my least favorite Stevie Nicks album, but I never truly realized just how profoundly disappointed I would end up being.
0307387178|4.0|I enjoyed this story.I like the way John Krakauer fills in the Chris McCandless story with interesting side notes and tales of others who had a wanderlust. A good book that I recommend! You may also want to check out \\"Under the Banner of Heaven\\" also by Krakauer.
1563894696|5.0|One of the best Batman stories I've ever read, The Long Halloween is for lovers of Batman and gangster movie films (specifically The Godfather). The book is huge but you'll tear through it in no time because the storytelling is so good and fast-paced. Notable in this series is the story of Harvey Dent becoming the villain Two-Face. You'll also get to see many of the Gotham City villains that we all know and love. This is a fun murder mystery that will keep you guessing and will shock you to the very end. The artwork is fantastic. This book is absolutely ESSENTIAL for anyone who loves Batman or comics in general.

0375826742|5.0|My daughter who is 11 has been reading the new series and cannot put the book down til its done. Already pre-ordered the next book in the series. Nice to have a book to hold a childs intrest.
0811875555|5.0|I have quite a large collection of Disney art books and was happy to add this one.  The style of the production art really takes you back to all the classic Disney movies.  It even includes style guides from Cinderella and Pinocchio to show how they influenced the look of Tangled.  Glen Keane (lead animator for Ariel, Aladdin, Tarzan, and a ton of other major characters) has always been one of my favorite artists and this book is full of his sketches.  It was also interesting to see art from his daughter, who now also works at Disney.  The only thing that disappointed me is that so many of the beautiful 'oil paintings' were actually done digitally.  They are still gorgeous,  but it had made me happy to think that at least the production art was done traditionally even if the movie wasn't.
B00005NTN5|5.0|I will admit when I first started watching this movie I was skeptical of it ever turning into some good. But it proved me wrong fast. This movie is full of suspenseful drama and tender, passionate love. A lesbian must see!
B002C6A6FY|5.0|I like alot of the old movies and casablanca is no exception. I think bogart was one of the greatest actors ever.
B0034G4OZE|5.0|I had heard about this movie from my grandaughter. Amazon gives a very explicit description of what the movie is about. The movie I received was in great shape, plays very well, and I love the movie! Please check out Amazon.com new or used stuff before you purchase in a store!
B001OQCV6A|1.0|Yes, that's what I said.  Let's be clear -- I love the classic Sherlock Holmes movies with Basil Rathbone, I'm a fan of Ritchie movies like \\"Snatch\\", and I think Robert Downey Jr. is a talented actor -- but this was the first time the Sherlock Holmes character was completely boring.  Neither the action nor the plot saved the movie for me and it wasn't Downey Jr's fault either.  I just don't think the Guy Ritchie style works for what I want to see with Sherlock Holmes.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This movie is just amazing.  If your house got foreclosed, if you know someone whose house got foreclosed, if you don't have a job, if you're an investor, if you don't know why these people's houses have been foreclosed and why so many people are jobless, no matter what the circumstance, even if you think you know the answers, SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!  It will teach you A LOT you most likely don't know. In a very well displayed manner.  Put ALL the puzzle pieces together for once, and SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!! ITS A MUST!
B000T2OMX0|5.0|I'm not a classical music collector, but I love my Bach and a few other things. I looked into this because I kept hearing the Cello suites on some luxury car commercial. Then I heard the record label mentioned on NPR. I will admit I was a little let down to hear him play the first suite so *fast* but you know what? The more I hear it the better it gets. Screw that luxury car commercial and its plodding, ho hum cello. Queyras is math and emotion and the speed of light. You'll think these things don't go together, but Bach and Queyras will show how wrong you are.<br /><br />The recording and sound are phenomenal, worth every penny you pay for this set (and hey, it's kinda cheap here on amz). The DVD is kind of throwaway but also fun because you get to see the setting where he played all this. Not a padded modern studio but a rugged ancient stone church. The music you hear on the cds, then, is not just Queyras playing cello but Queyras playing the cello playing the church, and the church playing Queyras playing the cello. Mise en abime. Buy this.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|Like most of the other reviewers of the album, I first Awolnation with the song 'Sail' and almost instantly fell in love. I didn't preview any of the other songs based on my love for the song 'Sail' before purchasing the album, and I was pleasantly surprised in the several directions that the songs take.    1. Megalithic Symphony - 3/5 - A simple intro song. Interesting sounding, a good start to the album.  2. Some Sort of Creature - 1/5 - I don't really know why this song is on the album. It kind of ruins the flow set up by the first song.  3. Soul Wars - 5/5 - The first real song on the album and it kicks it off with a bang. This song is up tempo and extremely fun. It combines a quick fun verse, and then a hard hitting chorus that combines screaming and singing. Great song.  4. People - 4/5 - I've never been a fan of songs that start off with talking, and this song takes a penalty for this. But as soon as it gets to the actual song, this song is more of an uplifting close-to-epic track.  5. Jump on My Shoulders - 4/5 - This song is similar to People, but much more simple. It's basically a fun tune, and nothing more.  6. Burn it Down - 5/5 - The sheer anarchy of this song is what makes it so perfect. Starting off with a crazy drum fill and then a quick beat and lots of screaming makes this song not only fun to listen to, but also gives the feeling of being on a thrill ride. One of the best songs on the album.  7. Guilty Filthy Soul - 5/5 - I love this song! It sort of sounds like a modern rock version of a Jackson 5 song.  8. Kill Your Heroes - 5/5 - Not as dark as it sounds, and actually turns out to be a bit up-lifting with lyrics \\"No need to worry, because everybody will die,\\" in one of the best choruses of the album. Great song.  9. My Nightmare's Dream - ?/5 - Interlude. Can't really rate this song.  10. Sail - 6/5 - I have to give this song a little of a bonus point, since not only is it putting this band on the radar of the music scene, but is doing so for great reason. This song is pure dark-electronic heaven.  11. Wake Up - 3/5 - The opening is a bit odd, with an female vocalist that sets up the song to be somewhat of an anthem, and then becomes a song similar to Soul Wars, but not as good. Not a bad song, but the band is clearly capable of more.  12. Not Your Fault - 5/5 - Another favorite on the album, great verse, great chorus, a simply great upbeat song.  13. All I Need - 5/5 - The only true slow song on the album, and it shows that Awolnation has the ability to do a slow tempo song just as well as a quick one. The only downside is that makes me wish for more ballads on the album.  14. Knights of Shame - 2/5 - This song is five minute long song, drawn out over fifteen minutes. It's not all bad, but after a few minutes it causes the loss of interest. Especially with the unnecessary two minutes of silence at the end of the song.  15. Shoestrings - 4/5 - A fun song. Not the best closer for the album, but it ends the album on a light note at least.    The ratings obviously don't add up to the 5/5 that I gave the entire album, but as a whole, the entire album works perfectly. Some songs are better than others, but it flows perfectly and is one of the best Electronic/Indie-Rock albums ever (Not that it has much competition...)
B001VZY4M8|5.0|Folk rock has really grown on me over the years. Neil Young is one of my all-time favorite artists. He offers a broad array of music, not limited to folk. Yes, he ROCKS as well, especially when he teams with Crazy Horse. You never know what you're going to get with Neil Young. However, in terms of consistency and variety, After the Gold Rush is probably his best work. Released in 1970, this masterpiece has withstood the test of time, and features some of his all-time classics, such as SOUTHERN MAN, ONLY LOVE CAN BREAK YOUR HEART, and TELL ME WHY. This album is aptly-named, because it has that folksy, mountain, and river sound that gives the album its feel and mood. I especially like the very short and to-the-point final track, CRIPPLE CREEK FERRY. Here, Neil sings about a riverboat (ferry) and the cast of characters who inhabit it as they make their way down the river. Simple stuff, but effective. This album is good traveling music, too. Whether it's this album, Freedom, Are You Passionate?, Comes a Time, Harvest Moon, or Zuma, you will always get a great effort from Neil Young, the hardest-working guy in the business. 10/10

B0018OAOQC|5.0|This band is the s--t! Simply put they straight up rock! You can hear their influences but they are original and refreshing. I am glad I stumbled across this band. Their cds are all me and my 7 year old son have been jaming to for the last month! The only time one of the cds come out of the cd player is to put another one of theirs in! I couldnt find any of their cds in local shops so I ordered them from amazon. I highly recommend. These guys do not disapoint!

B001RXB4FY|5.0|These dudes nail it! Best music iv'e heard in a long time! Very original and songs are very deep. They use their influences but dont copy them. So glad I have been able to enjoy these cds. Dont hesitate order them you will be blown away!
B004FOA84A|4.0|no problems installing or running the app. I enjoyed the puzzles, but the gameplay was much too short. Mabel a future update could include a sequel or extension.
B004C5M282|5.0|I only had heard 2 of their songs on xm and was really impressed. I went looking for the cds and could not find them any where. I finally found them at amazon and learned they had several cds out. I purchased all but the debut. These dudes straight up rock! You can hear several of their influences but they are totally original at the same time. I am so glad I stumbled across this band. My 7 year old son and I cant stop rocking out to these guys. I would recommend this band to anyone!
0316069353|5.0|As with all of Connelly's books, the characters are the chemistry and he allows them to grow and reflect; never stagnant.  Mickey once again is drawn into a case that truly affects him and his view of self from his own eyes, his ex-wifes, Maggie, and his daughter.  Not to give anything away, but Connelly does a great job of setting up the next book that will continue to stretch the character of Mickey Haller.
B004N44SOI|4.0|I first met Nikki Sixx in 1984 at the Rainbow in L.A. and continued to run into him at various \\"hairmetal\\" haunts for years afterward. He was always pleasant, somewhat quiet and had a great sense of humor and he didn't seem to take himself too seriously. I read the Heroin Diaries and felt truly bad for him; For his pain, his isolation and his loneliness while surrounded by people who either used him or were too self absorbed to care. Fast forward to 2011 and This is Gonna Hurt. I LOVE this album, it is heart pounding, thought provoking and masterfully written (as all of his songs are). However, I hated the book of the same name. I found it to be self-absorbed, preachy and condescending. I HATE that I hated it. I wanted to like it, to be insired. I wanted to root for the Rocker that is Nikki Sixx, but I can't and I don't. I find it impossible to take advice on the drudgery and mundane day to day life from a person who could fly to Prague for a weekend, when the rest of us can barely afford to go to a movie. I absolutely despise Celebrity Soap-boxing; To have to endure the \\"hightened sense of well being\\" of people who have more than I will ever have and who use their own sense of power to enlighten the rest of us poor slobs who need rescuing from our own miserable existance. I don't need to be rescued by someone who, in an hour can make more than I make in a year. I understand that Nikki has come to terms with who he is and where he came from, but I don't understand how he expects others to relate to him when he continually talks about photographing the obscure, derelict people of this world with a $1500 camera. In the scheme of things he is a person of means exploiting the underbelly of society and the rest of us are somewhere in the middle just waiting for a golden morsel to drop from his enriched existance. In the end, the only thing I got was that his salvation was bought and paid for. The saddest part for me was that he honestly seems to believe that he is like the rest of us and that we are all in this theatre of life together. I guess that part is true, he just has better seats.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|This is definetly recommended. The life filmed and presented is rare and astonishing. I love the slow motion and the work from the life crew to put such great stories together. If you like Nature and want to see a good glimpse at it with amazing detail this is the DVD you want to get.<br /><br />Thank you,
B004HO6HWA|4.0|Jason Stratham plays a stone cold hit man. The opening scene had me sold with an unusual assassination, although I don't know why a millionaire would keep his indoor swimming pool water so dark, someone could hide on the bottom. Jason has two friends in the world. One is a prostitute who he pays to be his friend (sex, nudity). And the other is the Donald Sutherland who gives him his assignments. His next assignment is to kill Donald Sutherland, which he does. Against anyone's best judgment, he then takes on Donald Sutherland's loose cannon son as an apprentice.<br /><br />The movie moves along as separate unconnected killing scenes, then comes together at the end with the expected twist and results. It also had a \\"Bourne\\" telephone scene, which is something I always enjoy.<br /><br />Good action flick. It never drags. Soundtrack was okay, but really needed to be kicked up a notch. The movie doesn't build any background or character, which is why it moves. Better than any film which starred Steven Seagal.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|I'd almost swear that it where they got the idea. Listen to the intros of the two songs back to back.
B002ZG99QS|2.0|ok, this movie is great! i really like it and i bought it shortly after it came out. but the dvd is horrible. after only using it a few times it started skipping and not letting me use the scene select button and now it won't play at all. i do not recommend buying the single disk Tron.
B002KLAL4W|5.0|For some reason when I first heard the album about the only songs that I got into was Force of Nature (that surprisingly was not a hit for them) and Amongst the Waves. On repeat plays the whole album kept getting better. Yes it's short (36 minutes) but it really doesn't need to be any longer. When it's done I am not left feeling that the album was incomplete in any way.
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|I used my new Rode Videomic Pro in a noisy restaurant, to capture the sounds of our Mothers Day group of 10, conversing around the table.  The sound was WAY better than it would have been had I used the in-camera mic.
B00009NHC5|5.0|Wait Until Dark is a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  The acting is great, the premise is great, the suspense is mind boggling.  You may try to think ahead but don't try.  You will most probably be incorrect.  It is a real THRILLER.
1921758155|5.0|Hard to believe it's a debut novel, SJ Watson's Before I Go to Sleep has garnered star reviewed from Kirkus and Booklist and was in development to be adapted into a movie before the book was even released.  And though I've read some excellent books this year, I haven't come across a novel that would appeal to so many readers.  This book has all the makings of an absolute block buster.<br /><br />It begins as a twenty something Christine wakes up in a stranger's bed unable to remember how she got there.  She quickly learns some disturbing facts:  the stranger is her husband, Ben who she can't remember at all, she is middle aged and has forgotten most of her life, and she suffers from a rare form of amnesia where she can't retain memories from day to day.  As she's trying to cope with all of this information, she stumbles across something more bizarre--a journal where she's been recording her recollections of recent day's events beginning with the title page on which she has scrawled, \\"Don't Trust Ben!\\"<br /><br />And then the story is told through Christine's journal offering the readers an over the shoulder roller coaster ride as Christine tries to determine what has happened to her, and who if anyone she can trust.  The dread mounts until the book's messy conclusion.  Because it's so well plotted to say Watson's story is \\"gripping\\" is an understatement, it is simply breathtaking.  It's a hell of a book, and is sure to be a hell of a movie.  Highly recommended.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Practically perfect, very thought provoking, wonderful story beautifully done; I am in awe, there usually isn't this much depth in \\"cartoons.\\"<br />I don't believe anyone has ever made a chunk of scrap metal so lovable.  I look forward to watching it many times: it's a keeper!

0316044695|3.0|This is an incredible first-hand account of an ill-fated mission of the U.S. warrior elite in the Afghanistan mountains and the amazing tribal culture that saved the author. I found the story compelling, definitely page-turning, and loved hearing about the SEAL training program. However, be warned that the author continually blames the failed mission, his friends' deaths,  (and the failure to \\"win\\" the wars) on the \\"liberal media.\\" His right-wing perspective (he's a Texan), is only in the background of this amazing human story.
B000H30B2C|4.0|I don't know if anyone else noticed it but it seemed to be an angrier, meaner Kong in this version. I loved this extended take on Peter Jackson's wider vision of the classic tale, this version seems more complete to me and I'll just be watching this edition from now on.  I still love the original 1933 Kong even though this is a pretty refreshing homage to it.
B004FOA84A|1.0|all i can say..   is that all the game went no where.  i expected more for my money.  totally not worth it.
B000NDI3SK|4.0|As much as I admired and enjoyed a lot of this, I couldn't help finding it a bit wordy and dry,<br />even dull at times at times.<br /><br />That said, it's also full of interesting insight and theories by writer/host Jacob Bronowski.<br /><br />13 parts, each covering a different key step in the development of civilization. It felt like a<br />very interesting illustrated college lecture series.<br /><br />A few of Brononski's theories seem a bit stretched, or even wrong headed, and the visual style is<br />dated and the effects less than impressive, but that doesn't mean the series isn't interesting,<br />thought provoking and occasionally moving.<br /><br />I'd recommend it without question, but be careful of all the 'it's the greatest thing ever made for<br />television' you may have heard. Sometimes nothing can damage your experience like over-extended<br />expectations.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|This movie is a favorite of mine.  To see how God changed Alvin York from one who did not believe in Him to one who stood as a pillar against those that did not believe when they came against the Bible standard in Alvin's  is a tremendous example.  And then again to see how Alvin went to pray and seek God on what He thought, allowing a change in his stand, was a great picture of how His people should be.  When Alvin read the history book of our great country of those who fought for our freedom, and decided as well that its freedoms were worth fighting and dying for, it reminded me again of how much I have to be thankful for as a Christian and an American.
0385737955|3.0|I agree with another reviewer in that there were so many opportunities to make this story richer and deeper.   I heard so many accolades regarding this book from some other sources that I thought my 15 yr-old son and I would read it together.  I read it and it was enjoyable, but nothing earth shattering.  I thought maybe it was just being a 'middle-aged mom', but my 15 yr old son said it was 'just ok'.  We discussed it together and we both came up with so many scenarios that could have been incorporated or fleshed out more to make this book 'wicked' (my son's word).  I am getting really disenchanted with the selections for boy teens lately.  It is becoming a virtual wasteland!   I am hoping that there will be more books in the future that can be 'wicked awesome' without being about vampires and magicians.
B004VQK9XW|5.0|I do not think this Sixx AM cd is better then the first, but, it is very close. This cd is really, really good. I like the concept of the cd. Nikki Sixx is a tremedous artist. These guys have magic together. If you you liked the first Sixx AM cd, you will like this one alot too. The last song on the cd, Skin, is an unbelievable song. Very emotional. The words are touching.
B000RZIGVS|4.0|Content is good - Duh, it is Star Trek Next Generation . . . remember this was pre HD filming so it is broadcast quality, not much more (IMO)    Plastic Case . . . very poor quality boxes AND no useful documentation ( ie episode list, need to go online for that )    At a 3 big bill cost I would expect a better place to store the disks and at least a useful token episode guild
B00466HN68|4.0|Time slip movies have a tendency to be more cerebral in that they deal more with the puzzle on how events will play out. The better ones infuse a stronger human element into them. This is one of the better ones.    Here's the scoop. Jake Gyllenhall awakens on a commuter train 8 minutes before a bomb goes off. He's a bit confused in that he doesn't recognize himself in the mirror and he seems to be involved in an ongoing conversation, that he doesn't quite remember, with another passenger played by Michelle Monaghan. Before you know it, he's replaying the same scenario with a few twists to it. And, as it turns out, he will keep replaying said scenario until he is able to identify the bomber. Not to save the train, but to apprehend the bad guy before he sets off a dirty bomb in Chicago.    As others have mentioned, this is \\"Groundhog Day\\" meets \\"Deja Vu.\\" The first time we witness the 8 minutes we're more than a bit confused, but the writer and director do a great job of filling in the blanks with each successive re-run. They also do a great job in bringing us deeper into both Jake's and Michelle's characters with each replaying, as well as the characters of his controller (played nicely by Vera Farmiga) and her boss.     The performances are great. The production values are great. The location scouts did an outstanding job, as did those handling the music, editing, etc. The script is good for the abovementioned reasons. As the movie progresses you get know more about the Gyllenhaal character and how he came to be in this scenario. Something happens at the end (and I won't spoil it) that normally might have put the audience in tears but actually made me feel good. This is a mature effort on everyone's behalf. It could have been a very shallow undertaking but the low road was mercifully avoided. Hats off to the writer and director for spending as much time and effort on the characters as they did on the plot. When this hits DVD it won't be a renter for me. This baby'sgoing in the library.
0142428272|5.0|In Fall of Giants, Follett seems to have finally conquered his obsession with good vs evil. In following the different classes of people in their separate countries and as their cultures collided he has fleshed out an era in history, World War I, seen from many different points of view. The characters are better developed than in his earlier books and they are seen as human beings with a great range of emotions. I think this is the best book he has written, tighter, more concise and incredibly readable. It was hard to put the book down.     Seeing the same event from the viewpoint of the English aristocracy, a young American politician, German diplomats, Russian workers, and Welsh miners was like a trip back in time. The portrait of the brutality and stupidity of war and the battles for women's rights and social justice was almost overwhelming. It was a feeling of being totally emersed in a chapter of history. Can't wait for the next book!
1582701709|5.0|It is a great book, it is for real, i hope i could apply it to my self, you should have a copy for yourself, it worth the money
B0000088DC|4.0|For those of you who want a review of the vinyl quality, skip the next paragraph.    Nirvana, the band that knocked a pedophile off the top of the Billboard charts.  It seems that only people who were teens in the 1990's understand how important Nirvana were to music.  On either side of that decade you have the coked up 80s where people seemed to have deluded themselves into believing everything was great.  Those of you who feel the 80s were great, go read about the 80s now.  Our president put us in a hole so deep we still have dug our way out, the party scene of the 80s launched an AIDS epidemic in the US, and junkies landed a deathblow on the war on drugs with their cocaine fueled binges.  While this isn't the only problems that went without notice, they were some big ones.  Looking to the decade following Nirvana, music became a joke.  We have shows that find the new \\"idols,\\" music that is built from the ground up for commercial appeal rather than artistic merit and lyrical content, and a rebirth of boybands.  We ended up in wars that we didnt belong in, an idiot coke fiend for a president, and the budget surplus built by the Clinton administration was shot to hell.  Now, I know the 90s were \\"depressing\\" to quote, well lots of reviews here, but they were real, not ruled by drug induced hazes and rose colored glasses and not ruled by fear of \\"terrorists.\\"  I really didn't want this review to turn into this kind of speech but seeing the ridiculous things that some of these reviewers believe was just a bit much.    As for the quality of the vinyl in question.  It says in the information section that the record is 120g vinyl but it doesn't seem to match up to the quality of other 120g vinyls i have.  The quality of the sound is good but I'm betting it will wear closer to that of one of my 85g \\"yard sale specials.\\"  If you truly want to get the album as a collector, try to find the original release colored vinyls.  I ended up buying one of the originals and found it to be much better quality.  However, the sound on this copy of the vinyl is still far superior to that of digital or compact disc if you have a decent turntable.  For those of you with just mediocre or low quality turn tables, get the cd, you wont hear a difference with this particular pressing.  The packaging is standard and includes most of what is in the CD booklet.  The artwork is no different.  Only those who have superior quality turntables will really hear a difference in vinyl and people who use them will most likely want to avoid purchase of this pressing.       Final Verdict:  Great music, decent sound on the vinyl, low quality material used, buy the CD instead of this pressing or buy the original pressings for a bit more money and a ton better quality.
B00364K6YW|5.0|We really enjoy watching   the Pride and Prejudice series, It is so true to the  book and the performances are just  right.
0439023491|3.0|I think I'm the only one who doesn't just LOVE these books. I enjoyed The Hunger Games and thought it was incredibly well written, although disturbing. Catching Fire just kept this horrifying story going with no hope in sight. I have to give it three stars because it's very well-written and the story is compelling, but I guess it's just a little too dark and hopeless for me.
1400052173|3.0|The first half of this book really captivated me. I found the author's words to flow nicely, telling a vivid story and being educational at the same time. I enjoyed the flashbacks to medical procedures in the past. We are so used to medical technology today that reading about what they used to do at Johns Hopkins was really interesting. Rebecca Skloot did as good a job as she could making Henrietta Lacks come to life. However, I was more interested in the science aspect instead of the social aspect, which could explain why I found the second half of the book to be disappointing.    I felt like there was a lot of build up in the first half of the book - as if the Lacks family was going to get some big redemption or there was going to be some big moment about to happen. Unfortunately, the story dabbled into more resentment/bitterness and spirituality than necessary, especially during the trips the author took with Deborah Lacks. The writing towards the end was also not as eloquent. It rambled, was a tad repetitive, and felt directionless at times. I also expected this book to be about Henrietta Lacks, but after I finished the book and had a moment to collect my thoughts, it seemed to revolve mostly around her daughter instead.     I guess the thing that bothered me the most was that yes, the doctors did not ask for consent before they took samples of Henrietta's cancer cells. This point seemed to be hammered throughout the book as the main reason the Lacks family was wronged. However, the author also mentioned that whenever African Americans in the Lacks community visited doctors, they would say yes to everything because the doctors were doctors and doctors knew better. So, even IF a doctor had asked for consent, Henrietta Lacks most likely would have said yes. That made me feel as if the author reached for drama in this book.     It was still a good read and I do not regret the purchase. I learned a lot about HeLa cells and it got me interested in medical ethics. I also sincerely thank Henrietta Lacks for her unknowing contribution to medical research.     If a friend asked me for my opinion about this book, I would say, \\"It was interesting, but it was just okay.\\"
B004IQMXD4|5.0|Fantastic album! Every song on this album is excellent. I think it even surpasses \\"Belladonna\\" and pretty close to surpassing \\"Rumours\\".<br /><br />Her voice is excellent on the album and she even branches off into other styles like Blues.<br /><br />Thank you Dave Stewart for getting her back in the studio to make such an awesome solo album!<br /><br />I can't stop listening to this album.....favorites include \\"Annabel Lee\\", the rocking \\"Ghosts Are Gone\\" and \\"You Might Be The One\\".
0439023521|5.0|What can I say? The Hunger Games is epic! I absolutely loved this book. The story is so intense you feel as if you are part of it all. I don't think there was a time where I wanted to put it down!<br /><br />The Hunger Games starts off by introducing us to a family who lives in the very hungry District 12 that lies in the nation of Panem. The main character, Katniss Everdeen (a hunter and gatherer), is an independent girl who has taken the responsibility of caring for her family.<br /><br />Katniss, I feel, was the perfect character. I loved that she was independent, but not hard, as she cares deeply for her family and her best friend Gale. I could 100% relate to her (minus the hunting ;) ) and she is a perfect example of what it's like to be strong and have the will to survive.<br /><br />Each district has a reaping in which names are picked at random. Those called are hauled off to be one of the contestants for the Capitol's Hunger Games, a national TV show, in which each contestant fights to the death to be the last one standing! When Katniss' younger sister Prim is called at the reaping, Katniss acts upon impulse to protect her sister and take her place in the games<br /><br />--- BEGIN SPOILER ---<br />(This is just a tiny spoiler, nothing big!)<br /><br />Alongside Katniss fights Peeta Mallark, the boy who had helped her once before. Although they are not friends, there is a connection, but all seems lost when the Hunger Games begin.<br /><br />Peeta is a heck of a guy and quite likable. I liked him from the beginning, where we learn about Katniss' first encounter with him. The way Suzanne Collins describes him doesn't make him this amazing, out of this world kind of guy. Peeta is a ordinary boy, who just like Katniss, regards the games as a death sentence, but also has the will power to survive.<br /><br />--- END SPOILER ---<br /><br />I had hope for both characters throughout this book and I couldn't fathom what would happen next! That is why The Hunger Games kept me on edge at all times and it was just fantastic! It is a little violent at times, but not at all gross or something one can't handle. I recommend everyone read this book!ittle violent at times, but not at all gross or something one can't handle. I recommend everyone read this book!

B004TE6F66|3.0|In Linger Grace is happy to have Sam back but knows not all their problems are over with and Sam is still haunted by the cold. In this second installment to Shiver, we read from the perspective of four characters: Sam, Grace, Isabel, and Cole.<br /><br />While part of me was excited to have the hunky Cole thrown into the story, the other part of me was really disappointed, because well...Cole just made me angry. I couldn't get over how his rockstar persona and stubbornness carried out through the book until the very end. You'd think he would learn!<br /><br />Cole is pretty much a lost soul who just wants to forget life even happened and stay a wolf forever. When Isabel and Cole meet you can see the sparks fly, but their relationship really doesn't go much further than that, which really disappointed me, because there was absolutely no love felt between Sam and Grace. In Shiver, there was love everywhere - what happened!?<br /><br />Grace I felt was missing in most of the book, which was a let down because I really like her. She knows something is wrong with her - actually she knows exactly what it is. She comes booming back in the incredible ending that you won't be expecting, well parts of it anyways.<br /><br />Isabel is angry and blames herself for the loss of her brother and when Sam doesn't take hold of what is going on, she takes the reigns and lets him know what's up.<br /><br />I did however enjoy Sam trying to become lead and take a hold on the wolf situation, but not quite reaching it. He has a hard time in Linger when he is apart from Grace and he misses his \\"family\\". Sam is a heartfelt character, so you absolutely have to love him! I do look foward to (hopefully) him getting a grasp on everything in Forever (Wolves of Mercy Falls #3).<br /><br />Overall, Linger has a pretty good storyline that is unique and at parts beautiful. But it just didn't catch me like Shiver did!

B00332GA8I|2.0|For one, brief, shining moment, this was the cheapest 2 GB USB stick available on Amazon.  Prime-eligible, low price...what's not to love?  Best of all, I could use it as a USB boot drive, and thus I could use it to repair a friend's netbook.  O, how she wailed when she saw me retract the foresk -- excuse me, the protective sleeve, and insert the tiny, white dingus into her formerly pristine computer.  Ha ha!<br /><br />As for the movie, who knows.  Personally, if they show a movie at MY funeral, the title had better not be \\"This Is It\\".  That's a little on-the-nose for me.  But if you want a USB drive with which to defile your computer, this might be a good choice.<br /><br />None of you are safe!

Lots better graphics, good learning curve, etc.   AB original is good, Seasons is WAY too difficult.  To end with, if you want better reviews and happier, less complainy customers of your apps, give us a date/day for a release, and not a week zone we have to guess and stew over.  Also, tell us about a month in advance when the day will be.  Just tryin' to help.  Good luck and thanks for the great apps!
B00009M6VJ|5.0|I can recall just bumping into this movie on the telly some years ago and being completely awestruck. I thought to myself, 'I've never even heard of this one'. This movie for me is one that is perfect in its construction & story. Every scene has meaning and is part of the jigsaw puzzle of the plot. The acting is great but its the director's construction thats masterful. Very emotional of course and one that I will watch a few times each year.
0385342055|3.0|i think i may just be getting tired of the shopaholic's antics because this entire story was boring and predictable to me.  it's not to say i didn't enjoy it at all, just didn't live up for me.  becky is back with her daughter, who really didn't play a big enough roll in the book in my opinion to title it mini shopaholic.  the book seems more focused on becky planning a surprise birthday party for luke...actually that's about all there is to it!  a few little side stories, but it's mainly becky planning the party and the wacky circumstances she gets herself into.

B000068OCS|5.0|Well made, \\"outside the box\\" film showcasing Phillip Glass's unique musical stylings.  This is not a \\"thrill-a-minute\\" Big-Budget Hollywood production - that is not the point.  This film is just as enjoyable to listen to as it is to watch.  The video adds depth and meaning to the mood produced by its soundtrack.  The most unique film I have ever seen.
1595141715|4.0|The world of the depressed and suicidal teenage girl might not seem like a world a reader (especially a young reader) would want to be opened up to, but for me reading 13 Reasons Why was an eye-opener for me, and helped me realize how much influence I can have on others, for good or for bad. Ok, this is starting to sound like a really cheesy review, but it is a really good book. I didn't give it a five star because I thought that some of the drama was forced, particularly the relationship between Hannah and Clay, but I would still, definitely, recommend this book to both teenagers and adults.

B000BPFBVW|5.0|[[ASIN:B0002F7I9Y Genius Loves Company]] Ray Charles-Genius Loves Company was a present for a friend. As I already had this album it was a great way to know exactly what I was giving and that it was going to be enjoyed.  It has so many greatly loved artists on it that it was a sure thing!  I love this album with greats such as Van Morrison.
B004G6009U|4.0|I wasn't expecting much, but, as usual, the Disney team knows how to take a flimsy story and flesh out characters with personalities, adventure, humor, romance, a bad guy/gal or 2 and some nail-biting until all is well.  We always know there will be a happy ending, it's the ride to that end which is so enjoyable.  Go ahead and buy it, your whole family will enjoy!
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Seems to work great so far - I haven't had very many buffering problems and no FCs.  It does randomly lose the presets, though - luckily I only preset a single station so it's no problem to recreate.  I really like the alarm feature; I have my favorite station set to turn on at 8:30 in the morning, and so far it's worked without fail.    The real problem here is that it turns itself on constantly throughout the day.  I've taken to fully exiting the app instead of just hitting the back or home button, but that doesn't seem to make a difference.  At random points throughout the day I'll unlock my phone or hit the back button or close the app drawer and suddenly I'll be looking at the TuneIn screen.  I'm sure this can't be good for my battery, and it's a little creepy as well, what with the permissions concerns some others have had.  I'd be interested in knowing just what it's doing.
1401307787|3.0|I feel like the authors heart is in the right place, but as a book on mindfulness and in particular meditation, it is over wordy with lot of new age generalities.  For example, one tip for meditation is to think that you are a mountain.  this is fine, but this is what this book is not necessarily a manual for meditation and how to handle the difficulties of meditation.  If you're expecting a book that is predominantly a new age thinking book (i.e. imagine you're a lake, tons of quotes from chinese philosphers, thoreau) then this is the book for you.  If you're expecting a manual on mindfulness then this is not the book for you.  there other books out there that cover that.<br /><br />I recommend reading the preview. I read the preview but wasn't sure about the book but still purchased it because of all the 5 star reviews.  I regret it, so if after reading the preview you feel the same way, save yourself some cash and look for a different book.
B000UBN22M|4.0|I bought this greatest hits when it was on sale for either .99 or 1.99.. So i felt it was an awesome bargain. As others said, it is missing a CCR staple or two, so for 5.99 i might not think it was as great a deal.    That aside, CCR rocks.
0307454541|5.0|Interesting both as a mystery and psychological novel, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo features Lisbeth Salander, a woman with all the symptoms of Aspergers Syndrome.  Brilliant and antisocial, this Nietzschean Superwoman gives the proverbial finger to the patriarchal authorities that have maliciously dealt her a bad hand.  Her story is interwoven into the story of Mikael Blomkvist, an extraverted investigative journalist.  Their two lives intersect and together they accomplish what neither could have accomplished alone.  This is a gripping book well worth the reader's time.

B001UV4XHY|4.0|The producers of the Harry Potter film franchise seem to have given up on using a different director with his or her unique style for every episode. \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1\\" is the third Harry Potter film directed by David Yates, whose previous work was mostly in British television. Yates seems to have been charged with directing the young wizard's darker years. J.K. Rowling's tome of Year 7 would have benefited from much tighter editing, but, unlike the previous two volumes, the filmmakers did not decide to correct this flaw for the silver screen. \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\\" is being presented as two installments on film. This is its only serious flaw. It could, or should, have skipped some of the wizard trio's camping adventures to create one, more focused three-hour film.<br /><br />The film begins on a dark note, literally. The Minister of Magic (Bill Nighy) announces, \\"These are dark times,\\" and the headlines of The Daily Prophet scream, \\"Dark Mark Sparks Panic.\\" Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) erases herself from her parents' memories, and The Order of the Phoenix prepares to escort Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) to a safe house under deep cover. But Prof. Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) betrays their plans to Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). Even the rare festivities of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding are interrupted by the death of the Minster of Magic and an attack of Death Eaters. Harry, Hermione, and Ron (Rupert Grint) are forced to flee. The only way to save the world from Voldemort's wrath is to find and destroy the remaining horcruxes that preserve his soul.<br /><br />There is an oddity in the tone of \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\\". It gives the impression that all of the necessary information won't fit in the film, yet there is a lot of storyline that could have been cut out to make the film stronger. Too much included, while at the same time not enough is explained. True to the book, however, the film does not shy away from the realities of a fanatically oppressive faction coming to power in the wizarding world: persecution, torture, and death. And a lot of dark imagery. This might be too frightening for Harry Potter's youngest fans. The level of mayhem probably qualifies it as an action movie. The film is generally entertaining, if meandering in parts. I found the animation that illustrates the pivotal \\"Tale of the Three Brothers\\", as found in \\"The Tales of Beedle the Bard\\", particularly effective.from the realities of a fanatically oppressive faction coming to power in the wizarding world: persecution, torture, and death.

1400052181|5.0|One woman has been saving lives for over 60 years.  She was never given any money, and not even her name was known.  Until now.  The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a non-fiction account of Henrietta, who in 1951, was diagnosed with and died from aggressive cervical cancer.  Unbeknownst to her or her family, a doctor at Johns Hopkins took samples of her tumorous cervical cells.  These cells, known as Hela, have been growing ever since and have been used in the development of the polio vaccine, cloning, and gene mapping.  They have been sent into outer space and blown up in an atom bomb.<br /><br />This excellent account is written by scientist and researcher Rebecca Skloot.  She first learned of Hela in high school science, and it has informed her life ever since.  The book is a story of how Skloot tried to find the family of Henrietta Lacks.  It is a story of Lacks herself and her poor upbringing.  It is a story of the life and times of Hela cells.  But it is more.  Race relations today and in the past, the history of cell science, medical ethics or lack thereof, poverty, mental illness all play a part in this compelling read.<br /><br />Skloot's capable narrative intertwines all these themes with the flavor of a page-turner.  At times, my eyes glazed over at the science, but no more so than my own experiences in high school science class.  But even those non-science minded will find much to love in The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.  To Hela, I say, \\"Hell yeah!\\"
B000XTLUW0|5.0|I had purchased this product and the DVD part had a skip. It wasn't worth it to me to go through a return process for one small thing but I mentioned the problem on my review. The seller contacted me immediately and offered to replace the item, free of charge, and with out having to be troubled with the returning of the defective item. Excellent customer service and very satisfied.
