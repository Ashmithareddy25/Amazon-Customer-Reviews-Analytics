B00GH4R95C|4.0|Best Superman out there. Unlike all the other Superman movies this one is actually different and more entertaining than any of the others. Less about him being a nerd and more about Superman and his past.
B001EN71DG|5.0|This is it. Period. Your choice between an enhanced Star Wars trilogy and an unadulterated trilogy that stays true to your childhood memories. Forego all the bells and whistles and extra features other box sets offer. Look for this cover and this cover alone. If you can find it.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|This might very well be the worst movie I've ever seen in the history of ever.  I cannot think of one nice thing to say about it.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Recently downloaded to my 7&#34; tablet to read books that I have been adding to my cloud reader.  Very easy to use and read on the tablet.  I had downloaded to my Samsung Galaxy Note II before and wasn't that impressed with it for reading books, but love it on the bigger screen.<br /><br />It remembers where you left off, and tells you how much of the book is left to read.  Combined with my subscription to bookbub.com for getting deals on book downloads, love it, no longer need to make trips to the library to check out and return books.
B00A6HHJ9C|5.0|Steve Lukather is a rock/jazz guitarist whose work I have always appreciated.  He is one of today's true masters on both electric and acoustic instruments.
B000QFCD2W|4.0|&#34;Give Me Your Soul... Please is a horror story about two children - bothers and sisters, who are viciously murdered by their father. After their death, the brother and sister become spirits, waiting to get to the other side. The powers that be wrongly accuse the little boy of committing suicide and demand he go to hell. It is up to his older sister to help her little brother to get to heaven with her. She devises a plan that will help him - to steal an innocent soul -her first victim? King Diamond...<br />King Diamond, the &#34;godfather of classic power-metal&#34;, describes the new album as the best he's ever made, &#34;It seems like we tried for 20 years to get a driver's license - and now we have one!&#34;<br /><br /> He states that Give Me Your Soul is his best cd/album yet but he also says the same for Deadly Lullibyes also which was his support live album for The Puppet Master (do not get me wrong) I love most of King's stuff but can you really say the same thing for a studio album as that of a LIVE album because it's much harder to play live and make it work than a studio outing, I am not putting King down at all but I'd still like to see a live dvd.
B0018BB20W|5.0|I've always loved the work of the Moody Blues rock band; from their origins in 1965 (the great tune &#34;Go Now&#34;) up until their most recent productions.
B00GII9UCW|4.0|While the songs are not well known now days, it is a good selection from an earlier Everly Bros. album from a long, long time ago.  Voice harmonies are great and it even sounds a bit like Don & Phil.  Norah's voice is what you would expect if you have followed her for the past couple of years.  Billy Joe on the other hand is stretching out into some different territory.  Sounds good and should be in everyone's collection.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like games that I have to use my mind and this is easy at first but it gets harder and then it turns into a challenge
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by World War Z. I really enjoyed it. The effects were great and the zombie storyline fairly unique. Now I wish I would have seen it on the big screen. At any rate, well worth the money.
1449433251|5.0|a great gift. very cool box packaging. We first received hardback, which was so nice looking but arrived with broken spines and we felt the 3 books were too heavy for carrying around and we might break spines anyway, so we were happy to switch to 4 volumes of paperback. amazing set.
B00BXKKNFS|2.0|Adblock Plus works wonders in Chrome, but isn't blocking the ads on my Kindle. It seemed like it did for a while, but then they reappeared. :/
B006HGXGWU|5.0|This is not an easy movie to see, but perhaps a prophetic one.  The acting and special effects are very good.  The ending is quite surprising.
B00G32OER4|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by The Conjuring. I really enjoyed it. The effects were great and the storyline fairly unique. I know there is some controversy about The Warrens, but that's no reason to avoid watching. Well worth the money.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|This is a marvelous series and well reproduced in this DVD set.  It's hard not to watch one episode right after another, and keep on watching.  I have had to pace myself and use discipline. I have pre-ordered season 4 and eagerly await its release.
B008K6HN8I|2.0|I didn't find this app to be intuitive. I couldn't find what I was looking for so I ended up uninstalling it.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|This book is the best approach I've ever seen to a book about writing. It digs into motivations and the frame of mind one should be in when writing. I've always been a King fan, and this book explains why. There are tons of &#34;how to&#34; books out there, but this one goes into territory previously unexplored. A great read.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Not quite as good as the first one, but very well written and produced. This should be a good start to an entire series of Star Trek for all the fans!
B003K025TQ|5.0|Just received 6 String Theory and this CD is SIC!!!  More artists packed on one CD than one could imagine and all of them giants.  My vinyl and CD collection can fill up most small audio rooms and this one has instantly become one of my favorites.<br />  As previously mentioned, if you're looking for the usual Lee Ritenour fare, pass this one up. But if you're looking for one great guitar collection that spans a gamete of musical genres you may find it all well within this one CD.  A must have for guitar players and guitar fans alike.  Just buy it.
0062127241|4.0|Good read and very informative of the early years of Rock and Roll. I recommend this read for the beach, not a lot of action but good and light reading.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|maybe I'm an awful human being but the whole concept of zombies is just hilarious to me . I Knew I wouldn't the WWZ seriously but I have a strict rule that I have to read the book before watching the movie, hence the fact that I read WWZ. I'm not much of a &#34;dyotopiC&#34; hook reader even though it seems that I read a lot of them.<br /><br />The book reads very much like watching a documentary and I think that is where it loses some people.<br /><br />I didnt find the book entertaining in a suspenseful way, I found it entertaining in an all-encompassing way. Since I fInd Zombies hilarious, and the fact I'm a veteran in the us Army, I found the book witty and funny. Mr Brooks did a great job at portraying how a military mind set might be during a Zombie Apocalypse.<br /><br />The part of the book that really killed Me though, and I actually shed some tears, was the heaviness of losing the sea life...the whales. The description Of losing the orcas, the blue whales, dolphins, gray whales, even the fish that sustain ocean life, killed me.<br /><br />I kind of wished he would have gone more Into patient zero; where the virus Came from, what did they find,etc. That would have been very entertaining for me.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good read And I would recommend it to my friends
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great story and very well written. Kept my interest though out the entire movie, can't wait for next the movie.
B00F4BJ4M0|5.0|I loved the original release.<br />However, this update is astounding.  It has crystal clear sound and is a joy to listen to from start to finish.<br />For instance, take the track \\"I Forgot To Remember To Forget\\".  I must admit that, in my opinion, it had horrible sound quality.<br />Since they only did this song once at the BBC, it is obviously the same performance.  But the upgrade in sound quality is nothing but amazing.  If I had to guess, I would assume the song on the remastered edition is from a better source,<br />Bottom line, if only for this one track this is an essential purchase.<br />But all the tracks boast improved clarity.<br />Buy it and get a copy for all your Beatle friends even if they own the original issue.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|my kids love animals alot so that's why I got this game for my kids:) they think this game is spectackuler!
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|This has quickly become the filler game of choice for my gaming group. With an easy to explain ruleset and a short play-time, we often break this out in between longer games. The theme is a bit off-putting at first for some, but once they have a few hands played, they quickly get into the spirit of passing love letters.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is a classic game a lot of people play&hellip;=perfect for any age. Very addictive and I can not stop playing,  worth the wait great time killer. RECCOMEND FOR EVERYONE!
B0036EH3UC|4.0|I bought the series because of two reasons: I loved the original series - watched it every week, and Lucy Lawless.  And both of those reasons didn't fail this series.  I found it to be very good.  Remakes are always hard, but this one had enough differences that you didn't feel you were just watching a remake.  Lucy was great as Number 3.  I just hated the way they ended her storyline. It would have been nice had they brought her to the new Earth somehow.<br /><br />But I found there was more there, as well.  Katee Sackhoff as Starbuck was completely different, in a good way, loved Jamie Bamber as Apollo - thought he was great, Edward James Olmos is almost always amazing in his roles and this was no different, Mary McDonnell made you hate her and love her at the same time - which is very difficult to do, and all of the Cylons were good and bad throughout.  When you find yourself rooting for the same people at different times to win AND lose, it's a good show.<br /><br />Bad things: They don't really explain some things in a good enough way, which leaves confusion.  Mostly it's okay, but not always.  Examples: Bringing Number 3's back just to further someone else's storyline, and leaving that model stranded alone - which is odd because that was where she was anyway; a few times, they went overboard on the violence, in my opinion, but then I'm not one for too much gore; couldn't stand the way they &#34;explained&#34; Starbuck's return.<br /><br />I loved it.  If you're not into spirituality or sci-fi at all, you probably won't like it.  But if you like a little sci-fi, a lot of drama, some great lines, and a ton of action - then you'll love it.  Honestly, the last scenes of the series make it worthwhile to watch the whole &#34;frakkin&#34; thing.  Sweet scenes between Apollo and his father, Apollo and Starbuck, the Commander (Admiral at the end) and the President, and all the scenes with everyone and the kid.  Loved the ending for the most part.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Shaun the Sheep is funny and entertaining not just for the kids but for the parents too. Highly recommend it
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This movie was a great second efort for this series. The charactors are iconic of course and the actors chosen to play them were perfect fits. A must for any Star Trek fan!
B004SOR4H6|1.0|I find that I am missing a lot of my mentions on Twitter and I literally have to uninstall and reinstall the app everyday in order to see all my tweets.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Enjoyed catching up on the season before the new season came out. The Amazon video store is easy to use.
B00GME9AJK|5.0|Ashton Kutcher surprised me here, this surpasses pirates of silicon valley, a true testament to the underdog. Great movie overall.
0739341243|5.0|I loved this book. I found it a pleasure to read, though I don't usually read nonfiction books.<br /><br />It's very informative & insightful. She also includes anectodal samples and real-life stories which are very interesting.<br /><br />It's a great book to listen to while driving. You will not be bored.
B001B1UO6W|4.0|IT IS A GOOD DOLL SCARY MOVIE EVEN THOUGH I HATE THE MOVIE BUT I WATCH HERE AND THERE AND I GOT THIS MOVIE FOR MY FRIEND. THE DOLL LOOKS SO REAL AND SCARY BUT NOT BAD
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Gift for my daughter. She is very happy.This is one of her favorite shows and often entertains her friends with a &#34;Friends&#34; night.
B00G32TD98|5.0|This movie was very well done. It's hard to tell if a scary movie will end up being cheesy.  This has all the right kind of suspense & scare! It's been a while since I enjoyed a scary movie & this one gave me that.
B000Q7ZND6|5.0|another great movie with Keanu Reeves, love this actor and all his movie. Sure a different movie, keeps you on your feet and glad I did get this movie.
B001O1O71C|5.0|This books takes you through the journey of a child eyes.  I could tell you the book is a must to read.  Enjoy!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love all the drama and sadness to the book.  Couple years ago I read the first and second book of the hunger games. When I read Mockingjay. I was really confuse in the beginning and stopped reading it.  But after I saw Catching Fire film. I had to read Mockingjay.  And I really enjoyed it!!!<br /><br />~May The Odds be NEVER in Your Favor. ;)
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Awesome show.  Great filming, clever dialogue, great characters.  I love the music for the show - quirky but memorable.  I on;t wish they would make the seasons more regularly.  Why do we have to wait so long between seasons?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it is very creative with every level and it is very fun. The reason why I rated it as 5 stars is because it Is very challenging.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I finished this book when I was at home and sick..... But this book makes me feel better, stronger, makes me kinder, I hope..... I really hope they do a movie about this book
B000FBJAOG|4.0|This book depicts what I and many others believe to a a history of the living dead and how the living have stayed that way.
B000QGAU4E|1.0|I don't understand why good reviews for this movie.<br /><br />bad storyline, bad scenario, bad acting  etc..<br /><br />everything is bad in this movie
1476704163|3.0|I do wonder what happened to Kesha that made her the apparent piece of white trash that she seems to be. I am really curious as to what her life must have been like and I hope this will enlighten me.
B00GSAC1UI|5.0|Just amazing talent with these five. There is no comparison with any other a capella group.  They are truly amazing.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|everyone loves angry birds and for a free game the angry birds seasons is a great one with TONS of levels!!!!! A+++++
B004SBQGHS|1.0|this game brought torture to my family members. everyone was crying because of how terrible the birds were. they got slaughtered by slender man. slender man threw them at the green pigs but its not the pigs that killed them, it was the grim reeper. his black bold costume made there eyes burn. wanna know who killed grim reeper? well it sure wasn't slender man. it was slender mans pet unicorn. yes, slender mans secret is that he has a unicorn. did I mention that skittles killed the grim reeper. btw, he choked on them. why didn't anyone put a caution sign. my child had nightmares and he threw his water bottle at me saying it was my fault that grim reeper died. he said he hated unicorns. so then later on he grabbed a potatoe and stuffed it up the unicorns butt. the unicorn eventually died. not because of the dragon, because of the potatoe up its butt. now my son learned that potatoes are very dangerous. we stopped eating potatoes because were afraid of our butts. now bye. I will be flying to potatoelandia.
B00FAI2IUM|4.0|fun game but takes too long to make enough money for upgrades so you need to invest a lot of time
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game the challenges make you want to keep playing but some of the challenges take a while to complete.but all in all a great game
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is amazing I already have 7.6, and 8.0 comes out December 12th!!!!!!! I wouldn't recommend this game for small screens though.
B000I9U9X6|5.0|I am a huge Audrey fan. I love most all her movies, especially this one. The dynamic between the couple is complicated, yet endearing. It's real and that's what I love about it. Hope you enjoy it as well.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|It's the old classic, Bergman and Bogart at their best in a story we, who survived those times, can all relate to. Have a need to see it every two years or so lest I forget.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|First greast 007 movie with Daniel Craig. Very good plot and Javier Barden is a great villan. Fun action movie.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|There is not really much more to add than has already been said. I saw the show on HBO but was still compelled to buy the Blu-Ray. This show has incredible depth, I found that in re-watching the episodes I picked up on more of the story and it enhanced the experience. It's addictive so watch out!
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Great documentary of the rise and fall of both Germany and Japan.  Seen parts of it on the Military Channel. Just had to own it.
B001N44BVQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I have re-watched it a couple times, and it is a compelling (and probably realistic) view into the complexity and complicated world of the CIA and the war on terror. DiCaprio and Crowe are excellent actors and I enjoyed watching them play off each other. I only wish they did a sequel.
B001P7HUF0|1.0|I tried streaming this movie, but the sound was really hard to hear.  I turned the tv up more than double the volume of what I normally watch stuff at, but I could hardly hear, so I stopped watching 30 minutes in.  I read the book a few years ago and thought it was excellent, but I don't know about the movie.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I have been more and more interested in understanding diet and nutrition and this book provided a perspective that I had not considered before. Namely, that counting calories may not be the best approach to sustainable fat loss. Counting calories has been a mantra in many internet communities because the concept is pretty simple and alluring. But what this book does is deconstructs the rationale behind counting calories and provides a good counter argument. My main takeaway is that the author makes a compelling case that our bodies hormones regulate fat, how much we hold onto and where we store it. No two people are alike and accepting this, this book provides a primer on how different types of food affect our hormones and cause us to store fat. Put simply, too much consumption of carbs will result in weight gain, regardless of the amount of calories you consume.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|Great Album !!  Christina Aguilera is so awesome, i just love her voice !!  Beautiful Songs too !!  I've started listening to her since I've seen her on the show, &#34;The Voice&#34; and she is wonderful, love her music!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I loved the sale price.  The navigation of each application is extremely easy.  I was able to do formulas in Excel and everything I normally do in Word.  The only thing I did not like was the blank PowerPoint, but I may just need to play with it more.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The best book I ever read. Nice job Suzanne Collins! I loved it sooooo much! BEST EVER I recommend it
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|High compliment. Telling someone else to read what I read in a couple of days because it intersected me in so many ways. Nerdy girl  who rails against fairy tale princesses but loves a good charming boy meets difficult girl book. And oh. My mom is fighting with living with wrestling with breast cancer and it's side effects like more cancer. Told my sister to read it. I hope she does.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|very cute game love the dragons I love bubble games and match. 3 games.  this is a niceway to pass the time
0316069515|5.0|Michael Haller has been and always will be a defense lawyer who believes in the right of everyone to a fair trial.  An attempt to work on the other side of the aisle created a scenario where he lost more than he could have ever anticipated.  Mickey watched and learned from those who practiced before him with the understanding that at times you have to step back and look at the big picture.<br /><br />The case he is working on now started with a crime that was committed ten years ago and involves a woman that Mickey thought he had saved.  The man accused of brutally murdering Mickey’s former client may not have taken every righteous road in front of him but he is not capable of murder and this is what Mickey is going to prove.  With Mickey’s team in place the group moves forward with putting the pieces of what happened the night of this murder and how it ties into one from so long ago that no one ever paid attention to.<br /><br />Searching deeper than ever before Mickey comes to realize he had been a puppet in a game that pushed an agenda he wanted no part of.  Being made a fool of is always a possibility when you get too deeply involved with a client but the pain of knowing it was a woman he truly cared for is a deep cut.  The ghosts of clients past has completely over ridden Mickey’s present and the decisions made from this moment on are going to crumble more than one life.  Control in the court is imperative for every lawyer to make his case to the jury of twelve that literally hold the future of one person in their hands.  Not guilty is more than just a decision it is an obsession for Mickey especially when his client is being used to cover up something buried that no one wants to be dug up.<br /><br />Michael Connelly writes so exquisitely that every reader has the sense they are part of the events taking place.  The characters and story are so realistically portrayed that you find yourself sitting in the courtroom four rows back taking notes and watching as Mickey Haller makes his caseas Mickey Haller makes his case
B00CE03UOC|4.0|You can have a relaxing game or have an exciting one and time yourself. This game isn't only fun, but a challenging brain exerciser. Good for all ages.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|You can get the weather, future forecasts, and video clips from Weather Channel reality shows.  Plus you can get mPoints towards gift cards and other rewards.
0545405777|5.0|The Hunger Games Collection are very good novels. I had a hard time put any of the books down.  I was so excited and anxious to find out the out comes.  I saw the 1st movie, which was very good. but the books are much better.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Forestry awesome game I give it a 5 out of five I especially like the online multiplayer  one of the best 7 dollars I've ever spent!!
B001AQO3QA|4.0|If you can get this set on sale like I did it's definitely worth it.Only way i'd ever purchase &#34;Resurrection&#34;
B006VGGAC4|5.0|Entertaining read about a truly interesting individual that I've always found fascinating. Because he's now a politician, I'm sure his views have been watered down and squeezed through the filter of several editors and handlers, which is kind of a shame. I found the first half of the book about his early years, bodybuilding, and entry into acting the most interesting.
B00AO686MY|4.0|I didn't get the cardboard sleeve like I had seen at most retailers, and the price was the same, so was a little let down, but still a well done Blu-Ray.  As far as I can tell all the special features from the previous 2-Disc DVD carry over.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|I loved this game. First, I had the option of what difficulty I wanted to play. I chose the medium difficulty and found myself scratching my head quite a few times. The puzzles were well done. The graphics were good. The music was eerie.  The only thing that ticked me off was that there seemed to be a glitch in the library.  My kindle kept bouncing out of the game then it wouldn't load back up or kept bouncing to the apps page so I could 'try another free game'. Oh, and the story line revolves around this boy but you don't encounter him most of the game which i was bummed about. I can only hope that part 2 will be just as excellent.  Kudos Big Fish!
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|Nice set, but was upset that there was an extended edition released not even 6 months later, and in 3D to boot, so wish I had waited, but still one of the best looking 3D movies I own, the 3D version is split over 2 discs, the standard version is on one disc, a DVD and Digital copy also included.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|It's addicting but fun as heck! I have a bunch of rares and play with my gf and out buddies when bored
B00AJLHUYO|3.0|This movie started off with an interesting plot and some great suspense. I thought it had a lot of potential but towards the middle/end it got cheesy. [Spoiler] The ghosts of the children killed it for me. All the suspense that was built up faded away every time I saw one of the ghost children look into the camera and throw up the &#34;shhhh&#34; sign. It was hard to take this movie seriously after that. The ending was about as cheesy as it gets. Overall, worth a watch for the good suspense in the beginning but that's about it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like this game because it is challenging. but sometimes too challenging. I would love it if it had hints available.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It was awesome it is so fun and so cool it was the most popular thing I had ever seen
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Great way to kill time and disconnect from it all. Fun stuff. Blood all over. Dead animals. Yay! Thanks for the killer app.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This story was a tear jerker. The first chapter was good, then abruptly changes pace and narrator. It was well written, on the &#34;must read&#34; list... And it is absolutely worth the time and tears.
B008JFURII|4.0|This was a great follow-up to RED the original. I mistakenly bought 2 instead of just 1, but since it's the holiday season I will save the extra one as a gift. Nice mistake.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|I just don't like the designs on the cards.  I like pictures better than writing that I cannot read at all.
B000002KCI|5.0|One of my favorite albums of all time. Glad to have found it and at a good price too. Happy days.
B00GX50BD2|4.0|Very good show. I was surprised at what i learned about him. He isn't at all how i figured him to be. I am glad i watched the show. Kurcher played him well.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|It's true that some of these stories have already appeared on the main Hyperbole and a Half blog, but I knew that before I bought this, bought it anyway, and have no regrets whatsoever. Hyperbole and a Half posts bear up well under rereading, at least for me, and the new stories that are book-only are just as ridiculously delightful and awesomely illustrated as usual. Basically it's pointless for me to review this, because I love Hyperbole and a Half so much that I can't imagine why anyone would be looking at this page and not be 1000% sure that they want this book.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|My friend wanted the miracle on 34th st. with Natalie Wood!  I hope she likes it, it's her favorite Christmas movie
B0068MNO4S|5.0|This is a fantastic movie. Rhys Ifans is wonderful as he is in any movie in which he is part of the cast, but in this one he shines. He gets DeVere just right.  I wasn't crazy about Vanessa Redgrave as Elizabeth I.  Elizabeth was a tiny woman and Redgrave is an Amazon, but other than that, it was a wonderful movie.
B000FWHVKA|5.0|This CD just won't leave my play list it always brings a smile to my face that music is fun. Thank you
B000056QE5|5.0|Even though this was made 50 years ago the music from Mary Poppins brought a smile to the faces of our 8 and 10 year old son and daughter.  The singing is beautiful, the tunes are catchy, and best of all the lyrics are clean.  My children loved this music just as I did when I was a child (and continue to as an adult).  I don't know who was happier with this purchase, my children (who loved the music) or my wife and I (who loved the music and the joy it brought our children).
B003VANOFY|1.0|If I could I would give this a 0 honestly. I have went through two of these and am on my third because they keep having to replace mine due to &#34;Known flaws&#34; in the product. The headset has charging issues, either doesn't charge, doesn't hold a charge or turns off and on. The red mic saying it is off will show as on but the other people can hear everything and it isn't actually muted. Half the time when turned on it will freak out and not turn on correctly. The volume adjusted on the side won't work half of the time, and buttons that are designed to do other things will affect the volume when they shouldn't. I have gotten 2 of them sent to me to replace the previous one from logitech because these issues are &#34;design flaws&#34; and yet each version has the exact same issue. Ordered a different mic for 1/3 the price and it works better then this one and haven't had any issues yet.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|BINGO BLITZ. I absolutely love it. It is so addictive once I pick it up I can't put it down
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Excellent dance tune, no wonder it's on so many commercials. Love the fast pace beat with the strong vocals to support.
B00AATV046|5.0|Always loved the movie. Saw it twenty times or more. The DVD was flawless as well. Loved the black and white. Any movie with Cary Grant is a great movie.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE!! Most definately one of my favorites. I could watch it over and over again and laugh everytime.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Watched this movie a few times and I have to say each time it brought back the little boy in me seeing action heros fighting the good fight and provailing over evil.  Just what I needed to give me hope in a mean and crazy world.  OK.. it not reality but why not escape for a 1.5 hours....
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Generally very good for what it does. Would be more useful if there was a chrome browser for iphone, which would allow casting browser content to TV. It would also be nice to be able to cast pc screen to tv, and not just chrome browser content.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Great remake of an old Windows classic. It is everything a card game should be. Besides a choice of color, you can use your own photo as background. Great job!
B001NYTXLO|5.0|Bryan Adams rocks. This is a great album. If you like Bryan this will make you happy. Buy this album.
B00B1LN8WY|5.0|The package arrived earlier than expected (which was awesome) and in great shape. I almost did not purchase this set because of negative reviews (I would have missed an excellent deal. All of the discs play as HD quality with no issues. Each season is packaged in it's own case just as if purchased separately. I am very pleased with my purchase and recommend it. I made sure that my DVD series was sold by Amazon LLC and not a third party seller. It's been my experience (and I've purchased hundreds of DVD's through Amazon over the past several years) that if you buy from marketplace or third party sellers sometimes there are quality issues...I have NEVER had a quality issue when purchasing directly from Amazon LLC. The price is usually more but it's well worth it.
B00008PX8P|2.0|I really like Led Zeppelin and it had some very good videos but when played on a 55'' HD TV the picture was poor
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Just exceptional I cannot believe a person can have such a way with words Suzanne Collins is an angel from WORD HEAVEN<br />That you for filling my dull days with such entertainment .<br /><br />  Hope you decide to make a 4th book,<br />  Sophia A.<br /><br />P.S I bet I would enjoy that 4th book<br /><br />HAPPY HUNGER GAMES AND MAY THE ODDS BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOR
B00GUJP9PG|2.0|So got the game&amp; it worked for a day then when I opened it the next just says loading and doesn't load. Fix or I want my money back in including the money used to unlock equipment. A shame. This game was so fun, while it lasted.
B005QI4TSK|5.0|I love this movie I watch when it first came out now I can show it now to my nephew, it's hardy to find good and clean family movie these days and on blue ray as well.
B007IK44CK|5.0|I'm proud to be a Prime Member.<br />This is a great action packed film. It is entertaining from the beginning to the end. Each actor and actress performed their role very well. The special effects were outstanding and the movie had a great plot. It kept me at the edge of my seat. I'd highly recommend this movie.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|I like all the MIB movie and you can't go worng Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones they work very good together.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Haven't used it yet, but is easy to load on the kindle and looks like it will be helpful when I am ready to use it. Great directions from what I read.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Riveting! The fact that this is written in a documentary style makes it all the more immersive. I would heartily recommend this to zombie and non-zombie fans alike.
B00D3LA5WG|5.0|Bought for a gift and haven't watched it yet myself. Will update this after I see the movie. Can't wait to see it, love Matthew McConaughey.
B0062YADWI|4.0|As carabiner, it's pretty good. The spring is a bit stiff, but that also means it never randomly catches on things.  It's not easy to undo one-handed.<br />The bottle opener is very strong, beating most bottlecaps into submission.<br />It also serves side duty as a pry-bar in a pinch. The carabiner itself was unmarred and unbent by using it to pry the cap off a few sternos.<br />Haven't yet tried to use it to hold bits - that's where my keyring sits at the moment.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|There is so many tracks and vehicles! I have upgraded my Ralley Car all the way upgraded and got to level 29 on highway! I have everything unlocked, I would recommend this game for all people who are into cars!
B004X80QNG|5.0|I have tried a lot of different schedule apps and this is the one that works best on my android phone.  It is easy to navigate and enter data quickly.  I am an electrician and need something in the field that I have readily available and works perfectly.
B000089RV6|5.0|Always good, was rebuilding my CD collection after losing it in a house fire..... If you like hard rock this is a &#34;must&#34; for your collection
B00EJX2YGM|5.0|This is an awesome classic movie! and it shipped to me very quickly! I was shocked! I haven't seen this in years! If you're a fan, you should buy it! :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game!!!! So real and cool!! Easy to use and fun to play. All the kids love playing this. Would recommend this to anyone.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The game offers lots of excitement and many challenges. Keeps attention of both young and old alike. Recommend it to everyone.
B00009AOBI|5.0|This is an awesome classic movie! and it shipped to me very quickly! I was shocked! I haven't seen this in years! If you're a fan, you should buy it! :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really get into these kind of games. I will just zone out and just enjoy myself and this one just goes on and on..so yep I love it
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I love how something that could have turned out to be so ridiculous has been made into something that is so well done and almost believable.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|perfect.; So perfect lady gaga is amazing artist and ARTPOP is a perfect album. The expectative is BIG but album is more
0399226907|5.0|My baby loves it.  It is a fun book to read through and those little holes are great for the little fingers.
0385535147|4.0|I have read them all so I tend to say, not one of Grisham's best, but still an excellent read.
1476727651|5.0|Yes,this guy can spin as scary a yarn as is possible and Yes he is HILARIOUS,but for this \\" Constant Reader \\",his greatest strength has always been his uncanny ability to allow me to inhabit the psyches of the characters he creates. This beautiful, twisted,supernatural story of love & victory is no exception. My heart exploded at it's climax.<br />Speaking of heart ; to those unfortunates who panned this novel :<br />How does it feel not to have one ?<br />Apparently a few ( very few ),of the true knot who ran away did survive ...
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Always Leary of the in app purchase games but so far I have not had to spend anything. Good way to spend time.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|Great series!  I really enjoyed these books and thought this was a great ending to the series.  I am sad they are over actually because I did grow to like the characters an awful lot.  Pick it up, it's a great read!
0525478817|5.0|I bought this text book for my high school astronomy class and it got me a big, fat, effing F.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Another fantastic read in the Pendergast books. I did miss his cop side kick. Looking forward to the next book have read them all.
B000VHKKRU|5.0|this is the one to get.  very atmospheric mono sound plus jochum driving the bpo around to let you 'hear all the sights'.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|This is a great game that always changes I have been playing this for years glad to finally have it for kindle fires<br />. Love it!
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|Truly, an extremely unsettling film of Gothic horror based on a true story. The casting, script, acting, set design, cinematography worked near perfectly to bring this story to the big screen. A film that keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.<br />Ultimately, the truth that runs throughout the movie is the most unsettling.<br /><br />Imagine the old Hammer horror films from the 50's and 60's......multiplied by 10 fold! You may get the idea.<br /><br />I'm convinced the few negative reviews are from the likes of the Freddy Kruger, Jason, slasher fan-boys that are neutered to real Gothic terror and horror. Go back to your lousy CGI, body parts everywhere, blood spilling out from the screen, crappy acting, and bad story lines. This movie is for the true aficionados of only the very finest in horror.
B005ZOBNOI|1.0|I don't like reading about cancer and all that so it was a hard read to push through! It also was very slow for me to get into and didn't have many interesting parts... The whole book was just sad to me and I regret buying it!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I've used this several times on several different blades and I don't have a cross word to say. Small enough to put in your pocket, easy to use and a great addition to your arsenal.
1878424319|5.0|This is an amazing read - HIGHLY recommended.  A great simplification of the most important parts of life.  Worth every penny.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great acting, good plot lines. When it concentrates on the lawyers and the cases, it is the most interesting. Thanks!
B00AFPTSI0|3.0|Could have been 1/3 as long. Info was good though, but lots of repetition. Has changed my outlook about functioning as a team at work.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Looks amazing on kindle fire hd! Great game play.  Handles really well. Better than sitting in a tree stand all day.
B00E9ZATJO|4.0|Super cute flick. Watched with our kids and it was a great family friendly movie! Great back story to our favorite monsters, Sully and Mike!
B0027BOL4G|4.0|You'll be amazed how the food industry works. There are gross & inhuman things that the movie shows you may not like. Live animals like cows, chicken, pigs, lobsters, etc. are treated as parts of a machinery to be chopped and processed. Mass production and assembly line techniques adapted from the industrial world when applied to the food industry has its pros and cons. Most poor folks working long hours or with multiple jobs, can't afford or don't have the time to cook their own meals. The fact is, reasonably good quality staple food for the poor and the common man in the USA and Canada is the cheapest in the world based on our per capita income levels. An average lower middle income or below minimum wage earner living in an urban city in North America can have a high protein and high carb content meal for less than $6 (i.e. little less than an hours minimum wage in most states) at a fast food chain. One can buy a whole roasted chicken for $6 and a dozen eggs for $3 at most retail groceries. Compare this to any developed urban city in Europe where the same would cost twice.
B008602KQI|5.0|Excellent movie that does a very good job of staying pretty true to the book.  Visually stunning and a powerful storyline this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.  This isn't a lighthearted movie or blow 'em up action flick... this is a movie that will make you think.  Despite some darker themes I really love it and can't wait for the rest of the series.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I really enjoyed the book but at times in was very confusing. I had trouble figuring out who was talking. If you don't enjoy books about sorrow or depression, don't read this. It is a very troubling story. I loved it.
B004132HZS|5.0|This is an excellent take on the classic Sherlock Holmes.  The two main characters play well off each other and Cumberbatch had me laughing me head off with his less than tactful approach to life more than once!  Very entertaining, very interesting, and very suspenseful.  I'm glad my friend talked me into giving this series a try and I'm planning to enjoy the following seasons just as much.
1419702238|5.0|My daughter loves these books and has the whole series. She thinks they are really funny and recommends them all.
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|I loved the 1st two Bridget Jones books. This one was great, too. I only gave it 4 stars because it appeared to ramble on a bit in the beginning. I was thinking that maybe to other books did too, and I just didn't remember? Bridget seemed almost annoying at times. I think because her behavior is exactly the same as it was when she was in her 30's. Now, in her 50's, you'd expect her to be a bit more mature. But then again, she wouldn't be the same old Bridget Jones if she were. This is definitely a must read for Bridget fans.
B00GX598FO|5.0|Exciting, loved the Porsche scene, the girl got to make some choices. Gonna watch the first again and wait for 3...
B00008EY7H|5.0|This is a great entertaining video. I find that I can watch over and over, and still be amazed and astounded.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I cant say anything else but its just awesome and its just great for kids and its a surprising aperence when at the end of  (I don't know what to call it) the level someone from the movie like someone bad you have to defeet.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book simply because I like to read a book before seeing a movie based on it. I was frankly surprised at how much it moved me. As a graduate student working on an advanced degree in leadership, I have referenced this story quite a few times; though fiction, it nevertheless depicts a compelling portrait of how leaders are both born and made. Like Suzanne Collins (Hunger Games trilogy), Card paints a disturbing picture of the exploitation of children, and the transformation of Ender broke my heart. I appreciate the fact that Card tells this story in such a way that I can hand it to my 13-year-old son without feeling that I am exposing him to inappropriate material, though I would not classify the book as YA literature due to the complexity of the characters and themes. One of the best books I've ever read.
0061122416|5.0|I loved. Loved this book! Great message about not giving up on your goals and dreams. Very inspirational book. I definitely will buy more books from this author.
B00F5HWC7W|3.0|This album gets 3 out of 5 because it's lacking a significant number of the most treasured songs of their catalog, the details of which I won't go into- if you're a victim you know what I'm talking about. Jenny and Natalie don't get any love here; This tracklist Is Wild! Even Uncle Johnny is so worked up he has to ditch the cocaine and Tranquilize instead. I'm really in the Shadows about what the thinking was behind this. Never-mind that's enough of this: I Can't Stay. I'll have to cool off on a Joyride.
B008LXZFH6|3.0|Good but not great movie such as Will Ferrell's Elf. Not sure that I need to see this movie again, but may have to catch the sequel!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I loved the first two books of this series but was very disappointed by the conclusion! It just seemed like it was a &#34;dud&#34; compared to the other two. It promised a lot of action but didn't deliver and almost seemed quickly written, like the she lost desire to continue with the story line. So disappointed.
B001R6G34I|5.0|With two remakes, THIS is still the classic story, without all the &#34;sub-plots&#34; that have ruined the others. There is a STORY here about man's interference with nature, and the tragic results to nature. Why did the remakes bring in aspects of &#34;human relations&#34; among the humans? THAT'S what caused all the problems?
B007EECSFA|5.0|Beautiful story. Very well told.  Young lovers in war torn England with lots of twists and turns.  Would highly recommend.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I didn't think I would like the game. When it's finally available at amazon games apps I grabbed it as soon as possible.  I play with it day and night. Everyone should enjoy this game as well. H
0761172726|5.0|This is the third year we have used this calendar in our department.  There are five of us.  Three are part-time and they work out their own schedules.  We also add institute meetings.  This is the best way for us to know who is working and when they will be in the department.
B0018M6J90|5.0|Wow! what a nuanced and wonderful film.  The writing is great and the acting is brilliant. I've seen it at least 5 times.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I am totally addicted to this. I watched all of Season 1 in 2 days. Not your normal &#34;lawyers&#34; program. The characters and plots are fascinating. Great acting and the backstory keeps you coming back.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Now I know why folks love this game!! It's addictive!!! Yikes!! The music is annoying and luckily you can shut it off.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I LOVED this movie!!  Action-packed and a thrill a minute!  You can't go wrong with Brad Pitt as the star either.  A great near end-of-the-world zombie thriller.  Don't just rent it... purchase it because it's THAT GOOD!
B00A757EFW|1.0|Never received this game on my tablet,  Disappointed.. and I could ask for return, but I don't even have a record of ordering it.
B00FPGSPQU|2.0|Hopefully the last 'Hangover movie', sometimes it is better to have one good movie and leave it at that.  .... kind of stupid and not really funny.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is only the second book I've read by John Grisham.  The first one I read was THE CONFESSION. It also was hard to put down. I like reading the courtroom scenes, although figuring out the answers to who everyone is in relation to each other is interesting too.  I intend to read more of John Grisham's books, just as fast as I can download then.<br />Thank you John for your writing, and story telling.  Thank YOU AMAZON, for selling them!
B00FRMDH7Y|3.0|This movie is average at best.  I purchased it for my 3.5 year old and even she lost interest fast.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Very easy, still waiting on upgrades, beat this app within 15 minutes and haven't had an upgrade with more levels since
B008FPOIT6|5.0|A unique story in that it was a booklover's book about a bookstore. Sort of a bibliographer geek mystery.<br /><br />As a retired man I read  a lot of books, nearly all fiction. This story leapt to the top of my favorites because each page was a delight. Each page not only continued an extraordinary narrative, but introduced characters (what characters!), poetry, clandestine elements, history, Holmesian analytics, and science. Such a heady concoction!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|The people playing the roles of the 1960s show play them so awesome, I just love it!!!  could watch it over and over again!
B000U1ZV8K|4.0|I really enjoy these movies, and the price was great for all four if you aren't looking for Blu Ray. I just wish the movies came as four separate discs instead of a movie on each side.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|This movie delivers several concurrent episodes which reveals issues sometimes considered taboo.  Fine acting highlights talents of seasoned actors.  Well worth viewing to the end.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Sounds cool lots of people to be. It all ready gives you 3 people to be.  This game gets the BUBBADISCO stamp of approval.
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|Good start to a new era of Superman, I think this film outshines The Dark Knight Trilogy and am a huge fan of Batman, thats saying something.
B008YU0AOE|3.0|There are a lot of annoying Pop up adds  and they ask for you To Update a lot also but the calculator is good.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I'm glad I stumbled into this book.  I hadn't seen the blog but I look now. Laughed a ton- teared up a little.  One of the funniest books I've read all year.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Finally the price goes down.My whole family all enjoy it.It is a good collection .My kids love the 3d a lot.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Orphan train is a wonderful story about 2 orphans years apart in age, and how their stories intertwine. A great book. I'll definitely be recommending it to others.
B009T1J14M|5.0|This is a book that you can never put down. You just read it all over again and again because it is so good. It's the same with every Diary Of The Wimpy Kid series by Jeff Kinney.
B00CW6DAKC|2.0|I don't like this game primarily because you actually have to purchase items with real money. Going to remove app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this IS the new best game OF ALL TIME and that there are so many people out there that have not seen this, but eventually, this game will be so popular that it will be.....  ON THE NEWS!!!!! It's that awesome you don like it???? Well then you're ridiculous!!!!!! And another thing... ITS FREE!!!! No cash needed, no &quot;kindle fire coins!!!!! Just... beware ITS REALLY ADDICTING AND YOU CANNOT PUT IT DOWN (that's literally what happened to my lil brother......) u read this.. NOW GO GET IT AT THE APP STORE!!!! And if u already have, then give yourself a pat on the back!!!!! I LOVE IT
B006GWO5NE|3.0|Reason for 3 stars is the actual length is not 5 ft - it more like  3 ft.  But, overall the products works well on my Kindle.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This game is really amazing!!! Good graphic good mechanics....EVERYTHING!!!! Except the glitches they are impossible to overcome.  They freeze my kindle fire HD and I had to restart. Otherwise really good game!!
1451627297|5.0|I have been a Stephen King fan since he published &#34;Carrie.&#34;  This novel didn't disappoint.  While it isn't the ghosts-and-things-that-go-bump of his earliest works, it was spellbinding.  King takes 2 popular culture themes, time-travel and the Kennedy assassination, and weaves them into a wonderful story.  I had difficulty putting the book down.  King's travel back in time to the earliest years of the 60s was well done.  Would recommend this book to any fan of King and anyone interested in a new take on the Kennedy assassination.
B00GINENG0|1.0|Tom barely grows at all. You barely get any coins. Tom hates me and I hate him. He is such a stupid head and he is fat. I wouldn't get it if I were you. It is stupid.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Wow I so hook I cannot put down my tablet this is very best to play for hour and hours
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Some are easy, some are tough. Its a good game when you need help to pass the time. There are many levels too
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|What's not to like about Mark Twain. I read this when I was much younger but I think we should re-read some books when we get older. I picked up on many more things with the second reading. There is a reason this is a classic.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is completely addictive. Once you start playing, hard to stop!  Downloaded for the kids and now the whole family plays.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is excellent. I have read it twice and seen the movie twice. Its a thinking person's book and full of rich storytelling, complex philosophies and survival. As far as I can tell, there are only 2 areas where the book and movie differ and it does not affect the movie. I highly recommend this book.
B00GMONG90|5.0|I admit I'm a Pentatonix fan since their appearance on The Sing-Off. Full disclosure, I'm also a singer, and I'm afraid I'm often hyper-critical of other singers.<br /><br />The first PTX album was quite good.  This one, however, is leaps above. The originals hold their own against the covers, which is not always easy for an a capella group, and the covers are just as musically good if not better than the song they're covering, several of which I don't care for in their original state. &#34;Natural Disaster&#34; alone is so catchy it's been playing in my head for nearly two weeks straight. The harmonies are rich and complex, the beats are driving, the emotions are intense. Even though I know there are only 5 people in the group, I keep trying to figure out where all the extra voices are coming from. I highly recommend this album, as well as checking out their official channel and YouTube vids. These 'kids' are impressive.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|After The Kite Runner, Mr. Hosseini wrote this marvel. Again, I like stories from other cultures or other places than those familiar to me and this was very different. I loved the main female characters. Their lives were tough but they survive and grow. I recommend this book.
B0095EMOTM|5.0|i would recommend this product to everyone. i would recomment this cover to everyone. i will order again with this vendor. i am loving it!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book has been made into a movie and I hear they changed it quite a bit. How else would it get a PG13 rating. This is a very good book. It is an interesting time in history and it is tough to face the issues and emotions of this time. I recommend the book over the movie if they have watered the movie down. I'm sure the girl in the movie has beautiful hair throughout. In the book, it is more realistic with greasy hair, dirty clothes, body odors and the constant threat of starvation and war. It tells it like it was even for a fictional book.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|What a sad story, but a wonderful book.  I have lived in the South all my life and there have always been stories, but Mr. Grisham makes you feel like you are living it.  Would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys legal novels.
B0041KKYCY|3.0|Not the best horror film ever, but certainly better than &#34;The Descent&#34; or &#34;The Blair Witch Project&#34;.  At least this had a story that was understandable.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I like it because it has birds and I love birds and also I aways get angry and I like to be in space one time
B00GTZJLAK|2.0|I was very disappointed in Planes.  I felt that Disney was just trying to cash in on the success of Cars 1 (I didn't care for Cars 2).  The story was bland and the movie as a whole had no charm and was only slightly funny in a few scenes.  Normally, my kids want to watch movies over and over.  With Planes, I had a hard time having them sit still for this movie and I couldn't blame them.  I was actually looking forward to the end!  It was redundant and predictable.  I got the feeling that this movie was more about being able to make merchandise instead of actually entertaining anyone.
B00DHHWXYY|4.0|If there is one glaring problem of this otherwise very good adaption of Fitzgerald's most famous novel, the post-production music soundtrack editors are the guilty party. For about the first half of the film, the party scenes which provide the backdrop to this story of the Lost Generation and moneyed inequity during 1920's New York is inundated with super sounds of the 21st century, replete with Rap and Hip-Pop. It's as if the filmmakers were afraid that using music from the era, called the Roaring 20's and the Jazz Age for obvious reasons, wouldn't be &#34;intense&#34; enough for modern audiences.<br /><br />The music from this era, which saw the rise of Jazz from its beginnings in New Orleans and into white culture, is some of the most intense party music ever written and recorded. Instead the filmmakers balked and settled on music which would have never existed in the post World War I era. Duke Ellington, Paul Whiteman, Fletcher Henderson and the immortal Louis Armstrong could bellow on acoustic instruments probably with bigger and more robust sounds than any generic hip-pop musician of today. The sounds accompanying the popping of champagne bottles will be forever fused together. Fitzgerald even wrote a book called &#34;Tales of the Jazz Age&#34; not &#34;Tales of the Hip-Pop Age&#34;.<br /><br />That being said, aside from the questionable music choices, the film is a reasonably good adaption of a story which is nearly un-filmable but has become the 20th-century American novel by which all others are judged. The stand out is without question Leonardo DiCaprio who almost single-handedly saves the entire project. In fact it may be the best DiCaprio performance to date, possibly worthy of an acting nomination. The rest of the cast is strong as well particularly Tobey Maguire as the straight man Nick Carraway.<br /><br />The movie begins almost like a music video with lots of quick cuts and slow-mo's to the rap and hip-pop which doesn't fit very well with the era it is trying to portray. However, about a third way through, the acting begins to hit its stride and the silly pop music finally starts to wain. Although the story references the crazy parties of the era, it's not about the parties per se, but about the strange love triangle between Daisy Buchanan and her two loves, Jay Gatsby and Tom Buchanan.<br /><br />Jay Gatsby is the &#34;new money&#34; on the block who holds lavish parties where all the elites of New York come to West Egg to douse themselves with champagne (currently illegal, but what the hell), splash around in swimming pools and throw tinsel in the air for reasons not completely explained except possibly to see if it sticks on the many statues on Gatsby's estate. In this film, Gatby's house rings of an Italian manor house a la the Renaissance which might make a member of the Medicis take notice. The narrator is Nick Carraway, living in a humbler house near Gatsby's servants' entrance, who watches but does not participate actively in the events which follow. The Eyes of Dr Eckleburg, like the eyes of God, are there on a poster in the Valley of Ashes, the industrial and working class area between New York City and the suburbs of East and West Egg. The story concerns how &#34;Nouveau Riche&#34; Gatsby plans to court his former lover, Daisy Buchanan from the clutches of the Old Money, Tom Buchanan, who is probably worth the equivalent of about 9 Windsors.<br /><br />Despite a number of reservations, such as the music soundtrack, the strange book ends with Carraway telling his story to a psychiatrist at some kind of half-way house (in the book he is disappointed but not mentally disturbed), and the character of Jordan significantly reduced, the adaption is reasonably good. And the performance by DiCaprio as the anxious ladder-climber who wants desperately to fit into the world of elite money, is outstanding. DiCaprio finds the delicate balance between friendliness, phoniness, and ultimate anxiety which is what makes Gatsby one of the quintessential tragic heroes of American literature. His may be the best portrayal of Gatsby ever on screen thus far. Carey Mulligan also makes a fine Daisy, who is not a bad person but only rather flighty and longing for love and fun. A recommended viewing.kes Gatsby one of the quintessential tragic heroes of American literature. His may be the best portrayal of Gatsby ever on screen thus far.

B004X6PRO6|4.0|Well written, tackling a subject (North Korean life).  But the descriptions, presumably accurate, are tough to read.  The plot and characters are composites, and sometimes get a little incredible or confusing.  Altogether a challenging, creative book.
B004A8ZWWO|3.0|I've begun to notice particular cinematic devices in these kinds of escapist heist and robbery stories. A group of characters resolve to pull off some kind of &#34;job&#34;, usually against someone who buys $25 hamburgers, $95 t-shirts and $5000 suits. This group may be professional or amateur depending upon the context. In &#34;Ocean's 11&#34; they were pro's. In &#34;Tower Heist&#34; they're amateurs. At the same time, both kinds of heist movies, whether being enacted by pro's or amateurs, have many identifiable traits in common.<br /><br />First, the rich guy being pinched is so flush with dough losing a million dollars would be the equivalent of dropping a penny down a storm drain for the other 99.99% of the working population. In other words, we have about as much sympathy for the victim as we do for a bacterial infection. Second, the motivation for the heist/robbery is usually engaged as an act of revenge, not just for pure monetary gain. So we sympathize with the robbers. Thirdly, we don't know how the heist will be enacted exactly until it occurs, which is a good way of keeping the audience in some suspense.<br /><br />One common device I notice with more frequency occurs during the planning stages of the heist. The characters are trying to figure out how to solve some problem which seems insolvable. For example, one of the characters might point out something like &#34;How are we going to get $50 million past the security guards even if we get the money?&#34; Then there's a brief silence as the characters contemplate the problem. Then one character blurts out of nowhere, &#34;Who says the money has to leave the building?&#34; Then we see the quizzical expressions of the other characters before an immediate cut to another scene. We don't find out what the character actually means until well into the heist itself. While it's not a bad story device, I have become more aware of it among these kinds of films. &#34;Tower Heist&#34; has this sort of device in spades.<br /><br />Josh Kovaks (Ben Stiller) is the building manager of a New York high-rise reminiscent of Trump Tower. The building is residence to a combination of home-owners, renters, and businesses. He not only knows the building itself from top to bottom, he is expected to jump through hoops to fulfill all the eccentric needs of many of the residence, particularly the high-paying ones. He knows when certain little old lady's dogs need a walk, or when someone likes have their favorite drink brought up. So Kovaks has to not only keep the building functioning he has to care for the residence like an on-call valet. The highest renter living in the top-floor penthouse is Arthur Shaw, a hedge-fund/securities magnate. Kovaks knows the kinds of food he likes, when he needs his car brought to him, even his favorite wine for a dinner party. Kovaks even has to play him in an online chess game. Part of Kovak's job is to keep the residence happy by knowing all of their funny little needs but gets very little recognition for it.<br /><br />Then we learn that Kovaks invested the pension funds of all of the tower's worker's hard-earned money into Shaw's investment firm. But now, Shaw has lost the money and has been arrested by the FBI for securities fraud. Only, despite being arrested and under investigation, Shaw appears to have lost all the money which means the workers have lost all their money. The doorman of the tower attempts and fails to commit suicide.<br /><br />In retaliation, Kovaks confronts Shaw in his penthouse and damages some of his property. As a consequence, Kovaks is fired from his position and charges against him are filed by Shaw. Now out of work, Kovaks finds out from one of the female FBI agents there may be some money which Shaw may have hidden but the authorities have overlooked and/or can't find. Kovaks is convinced the money exists and sets out to pool a group of the workers to enact a possible heist of the hypothetical money. A street-smart robber anddrug-pusher, Slide (Eddie Murphy), joins this unlikely team of amateur robbers. Kovaks had walked passed Slide nearly every day on his way to work at the Towers.<br /><br />A fun, sometimes predictable but occasionally unpredictable heist movie designed as pure entertainment. Aside from the somewhat current events issue concerning bad securities and hedge funds, this film does not have any real new ideas. No greater message concerning the meaning of corporate America. Rather, the film is about enacted justice, not unlike the battle between the social classes stories of the 18th century where the mean old lord gets his just deserts. I just hope the public will not allow real Wall Street schemers to get it away with it. Sometimes I wonder if the public watches these sort of escapist fictions as a way to &#34;get back&#34; at the real corruption of Wall Street. As far I know, no CEO of JP Morgan-Chase or Saks Fifth Avenue were ever directly victimized by investors who were &#34;taken&#34;.

B008JFUPFI|3.0|The main issue with the latest version of Superman via Christopher Nolan is whether audiences will buy into looking at Superman through a new lens; a lens which takes the Superman mythos and warps into something quite new. Is it better? That's the fundamental question. Many of the elements from the 1979 version are here: the planet Krypton, Jor-El, General Zod, Jonathan Kent, Lois Lane, Perry White and of course the Man of Steel. However, in this version, the many ingredients are switched around and the order of the recipe turns out quite different. It's still the recognizable Superman, or is it? Several elements are changed, including Lois meeting with Superman, and later the arrival of Zod on a mission so different than any previous offering whether it be comic book, film, or television.<br /><br />Probably the strongest aspect of the film is its imagery rather than the dialog or the acting. The story begins on Krypton like the older film. Alternatively, the imagery of Krypton and the inhabitants ring of 1930's and 1940's SF rather than the 1979 film or the comic books from the 1940's through 1960's. The ships and devices have their roots more in the original Alien film, with dark gray's and brown's instead of the bright crystals of the 1979 version. The story is updated to reflect 21st century United States rather than Superman of the 1940's or the 1970's. Lois Lane has a cell phone and even posts a story online. When General Zod and the baddies arrive, albeit before Superman is really known, the imagery and feel is much more like a current science fiction film than Superman battling domestic bad guys. This could frustrate some purists who wanted the story to reflect the Superman of tradition.<br /><br />Although the look of the film is tremendous, the acting and writing department is not equal to the first two offerings starring Christopher Reeve. While Russel Crowe is not a bad choice as Jor-El, the script and his subsequent performance are not as compelling as Marlon Brando's Jor-El several decades earlier. When Brando's Jor-El appeared in a black cloak with the &#34;S&#34; insignia, proclaiming an indictment against the traitors of Krypton, Zod and company, with the words &#34;This is no fantasy&#34;, we are pulled into a story about justice, right and wrong. The myth of Superman embodies the ideas of justice and morality. Although Superman itself is a fantasy, the issues of right and work, good vs evil, are every-present. Unfortunately, the present script didn't quite find a rhetorical theme from which to build a story. I had trouble really understanding what this film was about.<br /><br />The one character which was the most disappointing was General Zod. I realized what a tremendous performance Terence Stamp offered as Zod in the earlier films and yet here the present casting and his script were far less compelling. Somehow, the current Zod seems less intelligent and more prone to fits of rage. When Zod and his cohorts are on trial in the original film, you never sense that Zod is a victim but an individual who has acted out of malice by pure choice. In fact at the beginning of the 1978 version, we know that the failed coup, although we never saw it play out. We recognize because of the seriousness of the criminal proceedings, the overthrow came dangerously close to succeeding. The current Zod seems over his head, and not in fully in control. The coup is shown but somehow seems less believable, maybe even slightly contrived. Zod will essentially continue what he began on Krypton on Earth.<br /><br />What may save the film is the two leads played by Henry Cavill and Amy Adams. Cavill is a decent Superman and Adams holds her own as Lane. They definitely had more chemistry than the 2006 Superman Returns but not quite the magnetism as Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder. The film then lapses into long action sequences which seem never to end, with the rather complex and convoluted plot not fully explained to satisfaction. While I understand the need not to repeat earlier Superman's, this film just misses the mark. A noble but rather disappointing entry into the Superman canon.n.

0792165020|5.0|When people on the lower rungs of the social ladder see those on the upper rungs, they may wonder what do those people up there have that we don't? Are they really smarter? Do they have so much more talent? Or is it only that those in the upper circles get more opportunities while others have to climb there way up and try to prove themselves while those enjoying the benefits take it for granted? It might seem unfair. However, maybe there's a different way. What if someone pretended like he or she were already among the social elite? What if someone fabricated their education, their talents and their social standing to infiltrate the upper class which often seems barred to those in the lower classes? Would they possibly gain opportunities by simply pretending that they were already a member? Of course they would not only have to create a personal history but also master the etiquette of those on top.<br /><br />This is what the young Tom Ripley sets out to do in his first episode of infiltrating the upper echelons through deceit and eventually crime. Matt Damon, in a tour-de-force performance, is a lowly hotel worker who manages to get into social gatherings of the upper-crust. He plays piano at a high-class event, substituting for someone who didn't want to take the gig. He even borrows a jacket with the Princeton Univesity logo. There he meets an older couple whose son went to Princeton. When the couple inquire if Ripley had met their son, he acts as if they were old friends. We learn that the son is living in Italy and that his father desperately wants him to return. He offers Ripley $1000 plus expenses if he'll go to Italy and bring him back his son.<br /><br />In a short time, Ripley is in an Italian town replete with stone walkways and narrow streets. He finds Dickie Greenleaf, played by Jude Law in an equally stunning performance, living in a perpetual paradise with his girlfriend Marge (Gwentheth Paltro). Because he's independently wealthy, Dickie drinks and plays Jazz, and occasionally cheats on his girlfriend. all the while housed in a beautiful seaside apartment. Ripley befriends the couple, and they become a kind of strange three-some. The three get along almost like a little family, with Ripley and Dickie like brothers, and Marge acting both as the female lover of Dickie but also rather maternal towards the other two males. Another friend of Dickie's enters into the menage a trois, Freddie (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who suspects something isn't quite right with Tom Ripley. Dickie and Tom's friendship becomes strained when, at one point, Dickie also begins to question who Ripley really is and his motives.<br /><br />A stunning completely character-driven story. The acting is absolutely first rate. The most impressive is the relationship between Damon and Law which is so believable you feel as if you're spying on real people rather than watching a movie. The actors create a mystical bond which is uncommon in film, reminiscent of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and like films. But here, there is a perfect blend of drama and suspense which makes Ripley one of the most interesting and original of films.plays Jazz, and occasionally cheats on his girlfriend. all the while housed in a beautiful seaside apartment.

B00CDTSFF8|5.0|After the Fall of the Roman Empire, circa 400 CE, Europe and her surrounding territories plunged into an abysmal era, often called the Dark Ages. While some believe the term too pejorative, other scholars have acknowledged it as a strange time when societal infrastructure was very tenuous. Warring barbarians battled for land and wealth across Europe until the territory was more or less united under Charlemagne in circa 800. Of the many barbarian groups associated with the Dark Ages, including the Goths and the Huns, the Vikings still capture our imaginations. Their picturesque ships with ornamented bow and single mast sail are iconic imagery associated with voyage, plunder and even pagan mythology. Their battle-axes, thick swords, and wooden shields symbolize a world plunged into literary and cultural darkness in which warrior might was esteemed beyond all else. Unfortunately the Vikings plundered many areas of Europe, notably the Irish monasteries where beautiful books were pillaged for the jewels ornamenting their covers.<br /><br />The History Channel has produced a narrative series chronicling the lives of a Viking tribe during the 8th century. Ragnar Lothbrok (Travis Fimmel) is the man of a humble family of four living on the outskirts of a Viking settlement. He and his family have sworn fealty to Earl Haraldson (Gabriel Byrne), the chieftain of the tribe. In the first episode, the story begins at the end of a battle in which Lothbrok has survived a brutal confrontation. We learn not only of his family and his farm but that Lothbrok is a warrior who has ambitions to raid the west by sea.<br /><br />Lothbrok and his son travel to the main urban center of their tribe. There, Lothbrok's son and another boy swear fealty to Earl Haraldson by kneeling and accepting a wrist ring. Oaths of fealty, the swearing of allegiance to a lord, became a widespread ceremonial rite during the Dark Ages. The ritual is associated with feudalism in which vassals swore allegiance and servitude to a lord. Before the oath, the boys along with a congregation of males, witness a trial and punishment of two residents who are convicted of crimes. After the ceremonies, Lothbrok suggests to the earl and those present that they sail west instead of their typical eastern raid. Earl Haraldson becomes indignant and chastises Lothbrok in private.<br /><br />However, unbeknown-st to the Earl, Lothbrok has secretly commissioned a new ship to sail west thus disobeying his lord's instructions. Thus begins a wonderful series of Viking culture intertwined with a compelling story. The production values are as good as any feature film recently produced. The photography of the lush Scandinavian landscapes is breathtaking, the acting superb, and the script compelling. This offering is far more compelling with a richer tapestry than other similar series such as the Tutors which was nothing more than a soap opera set in the 16th century. &#34;Vikings&#34; is one of the best historical made-for-television series since &#34;Band of Brothers&#34;.servitude to a lord.

I highly recommend this book! You won't be disappointed.

0525476881|5.0|Brilliant little YA book by a brilliant author of that genre. It was the first John Green novel that I read, and the clever writing style and quirky characters have led me to read almost all his other books. At it's heart, it is a coming of age book about a child prodigy who is starting to feel past his prime. His odd obsession with women named Katherine is finally ended when he ends up in the charmingly odd Tennessee town where the remains of Franz Ferdinand allegedly rest. It's a Hope/Crosby Road picture, only they are only teens and are stuck travelling down I-65. Perfect for your teenagers or even tweens to read. A welcome diversion from all that dystopian teen lit that's out there.

This time took a couple days for the one book, but it was even more consuming than the first time.

The story of a man who doesn't quite understand who he is or what he's become, searching out his past and trying to understand who he really is and if there's any chance at all for a normal life is utterly transfixing. Matt Damon is a star in these movies and I simply can't get enough of them.

A young woman in an antique shop has the opportunity to interview a famous author in her old and mysterious house? Yeah, this book was written for me. I only wish I could write so well. I read this for a book club in October and was fortunate enough to catch the release of her second novel. I'm reading that now. Ms. Setterfield is a master storyteller and a superlative writer. I'm a fan!

It's laugh out loud hilarious, very cleverly written, often subtle, at times quite moving and totally addictive.<br />Episodes are 20 minutes long so watching three back-to-back for an hour is a perfect way to brighten up your evening without \\"overkill\\".<br />Just finished Series 1 and find it difficult to believe that the next three series can keep up such an incredibly high standard, but the reviews suggest they do.<br />A brilliant discovery and a view endorsed by everyone else I know who's discovered it...

The two begin to fall in love.<br /><br />John Green reached out and touched my heart!

B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I got this app as one of the free apps of the day but would've coughed up the 2 dollars for it. The graphics and gameplay are super smooth, I wish they would give you more ships because once the shields are gone you're through. Highly recommend this game to anyone who has a few minutes to shoot a lot of stuff up!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|having so much fun. it makes you think. I would definatatly reccomend this game to all who are thinkers out there
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|A wonderful romp through a tale of adventure, pursuit of dreams, and revenge through the vehicle of magic tricks and the magic of love.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Oh my god as always a great book. Have not put it down.Even with the thanksgiving holiday I could not put this down. I have loved all these books and cannot wait to see what happens next in the adventures of agent penergrast
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|bloons TD 5 is amazing it has a lot of fun but when you hit rounds higher than 90 it stats to get slow but its still really fun I highly recommend it.
B003MC5N28|5.0|This story will take you an a journey that will either leave you with a bright vision of hope, or depending on how you view life, a dark vision of hopelessness and death.
B0031TZ9KS|5.0|The risk of writing from the viewpoint of an autistic boy could have easily backfired, but in this case it made for a unique and enjoyable read.  Mark Haddon captured the essence of his narrator in a way that enhanced the story, rather than detracting from it, and the simple events of a young man's life become profound and meaningful.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|I liked the Expendables, but the Expendables 2 is a better movie, action is very good, story line is also good!
B0052REUW0|5.0|I very much enjoy reading Steven Pinker's other books and this one will appeal to readers who enjoy his writing.  Despite what we hear and see on the news, Pinker makes a compelling case for how far humankind has progressed in the quest for creating a kinder and gentler society.
B0012YYZYK|5.0|If you appreciate good raw talent, it doesn’t get better than this. Watching these guys work is really something. The professionalism, the passion, the talent, and at such a young age – these guys were born to do exactly what they were doing. If you knew of Led Zeppelin, but didn’t know Led Zeppelin, this will help you understand why they are truly a legend. With a good sized, high quality TV and a good sound system, the concert clips put you there - attending a live concert.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell is known for taking a contrarian view to 'conventional wisdom' and once again he lays out a compelling case for reassessing how we see the world.  Readers who loved Gladwell's other books will applaud and embrace this latest offering, and his detractors will point out Gladwell's over-simplification of complex issues.  I enjoy his writing and feel like I have learned something from &#34;David and Goliath&#34;, even if it is as simple as 'not everything is as straightforward as it looks.'
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|A real classic, what is not to like about it?<br />Great to watch after a recent visit to Mt Rushmore.
1465414444|4.0|I really enjoyed wading through all the artwork in this book! I think it was excellently laid out and provides some great context about many characters that have made the game lore what it is today!
B00BEIYMIS|1.0|Kids eating about the breakfast table.  Couples folding laundry.  Approaching and driving into a driveway before a cutaway to the Brady Bunch.  Polite introductions to five siblings, Mom and Dad Perron.  Multiple denials of breaking wind.  Setting up microphones.  Lecture hall filmstrips.  This is some scary stuff!  Compared to this (and at multiple times I could swear I was watching it), the remake of \\"Amityville Horror\\" should make the Criterion Collection.  What a snooze fest!  Some of the most wooden, fake acting (pretending?) I've witnessed in ages.  By the way, not every American male in the early 70's sported muttonchops.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is not ethical that you charge all through the game.<br />You should just charge $20 for the complete game and not be so greedy. I would recommend that you really learn all the facts before obtaining this game.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I like the product for watching Netflix and Youtube content. My main reason I purchased was to beam out of market NHL games onto my TV with the cast tab feature. Although it works, the picture quality is awful and the lag is horrific. I hardwired my laptop to our router to get a better picture quality. Other than that, I'm excited for future updates and newer applications. I love not having to run my PS3 just to watch Netflix on my TV now though .
B000P0J0A6|4.0|Love this classic from my childhood will never grow old...meets Steven Spielberg standards of the day, for sure! This generation should definitely be let in on this timeless classic
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is awesome. Forget Candy Crush; I got bored with that one in a few days. This is my go-to game when I have to wait for anything.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Doesn't download onto my Kindle Fire so i really didn't have an opportunity to try it out and see if it works.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|the game is fun and addictive.  but the constant push to purchase boosts is rude.  and...it is designed to eat up the boosts you get from friends.  Max lives you can have is 5 even if your friends send you extra....they wont credit and they are just gone. probably. the same deal if you buy extra.  I finally uninstalled this app today when it wouldn't recognize my $.99 boost purchase and I lost my progress with one jelly left.  I will be leary of any future king.com games.  games are fun....feeling like you are being manipulated... not fun.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Works sometimes but not always.<br /><br />I was able to use it on Netflix but noticed that there is some compatibility issue, it works only sometimes. On many shows it tells me to try at a later time.<br /><br />Works okay on Youtube though.
1476727651|5.0|Great book, great sequel to The Shining : it lives up to the hype. You're in for some suprises too!
B0052REUW0|4.0|Provocative and, for the most part, pretty convincing, but it could have been edited down a bit.  It seems to go on and on and on, sometimes with rather thin evidentiary support.
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|Glad to see a return to old characters and a more historically based subplot. I did not care for the Helen trilogy as much as earlier works such as Cabinet of Curiosities.  Still a big fan.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|If you love HBO's 'A Game of Thrones' ...read the books...really...read the books...there are detail's that really fill out the story…

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is about the human spirit.  John Green gives us these wonderful characters, all of whom you come to love and wish you could be more like.  He treats an unimaginably sad subject with such grace and integrity.  This book is sad, but it is also inspirational.
055358202X|3.0|Out of all the books in this series that are currently out for purchase it is not a surprise to me that this one has stars in the most equally distributed line up that you can find.  A Feast for Crows is the fourth book in what is to be the seven part series of A Song of Ice and Fire.  It is also the most droll.<br /><br />First, you will notice a change in the titles of the chapters.  Although there are a healthy spattering of named chapters throughout, there are certain chapters, mostly introducing relatively new characters, that have creatively inspired titles such as &#34;The Queenmaker&#34; and &#34;The Iron Captain&#34; or &#34;The Reaver&#34;.  It lends a certain discontinuity to the entire book and makes it even harder to remember all of those pesky names.<br /><br />Secondly, with so many people dead from the last book, the interest in the ones that remain are tenuous at best.  What's more is that George R.R. Martin absolutely refused to put in chapters about some of our favorite characters.  Tyrion for one, Daenerys for another.  He admits, at the end, that the following book (which was intended for a 2006 release date but only came out in late 2012) A Dance With Dragons would include all of our favorites again taking place during the same time period as A Feast For Crows since the chapters, admittedly, got away from him.  Alright, fine.  I can let that slide.  However, the book takes more of a fall than that.<br /><br />The third point, and why this book will only receive two stars from me, is that the characters that ARE left to us are a pain to get through.  They all seem profoundly negative, and the ones that don't are hardly doing anything worth mentioning.  Although almost all the other books came to a head during the last few hundred pages, A Feast For Crows comes to a sliding, unexciting halt with only a few noted events occurring.  My biggest gripe is with Cersei, who prattles on (a word she likes to use towards everyone else but herself) in a manhood comparison game that takes place in her head and her head alone.  I understand her feminist and highly impressive opinions, don't get me wrong, but it gets boring fast.  Thankfully, it seems she might be getting a tad more interesting as we move along.<br /><br />However, after all of that, this is not to say the book is a poor addition to one's shelf or the series.  In fact, it's still quite good.  The writing is excellent, as always, and we, also as always, are always constantly in conflict with how we  should feel about the events and the characters within those events.  This is truly a love to hate and hate to love scenario book.  It also sets up events that need to be followed and curiosities.  Unfortunately, a lot of those curiosities come from the previous books, carried over a thousand pages of limited eyebrow raising, but it can be forgiven.  After all, the war is more of an afterthought at current even if the hold on Westeros is tenuous.<br /><br />What this book DOES do, rather nicely at that, is give us a more accurate view of the lands across the Narrow Sea.  Braavos comes to life as a new, enticing city with a whole new set of cultures and laws.  With Daenerys lingering, building her army, and hopefully her ability to rule, we need to have a more detailed expression of these lands other than just a big desert with a spattering of cities in between.  It was a solid move on Martin's part and one in which I will commend him.<br /><br />All in all, it's hard to get through and might be boring, but necessary for the series and for the tales to continue.hood comparison game that takes place in her head and her head alone.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It would be a 5 if the game features where available on all devices. It's different from my pc, phone, and tablet. For example the new prize wheel is on my phone but not on my tablet.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game is great to play the only drawback is it take a long time to regenerative and to accumulate crystals.
B004EF65QA|5.0|I watched this on a whim and was not disappointed!  I even kept going back to my favorite parts to rewatch it!
B000FC146C|3.0|Was an interesting story with many layers but some of the layers were of no interest to me.  I am an avid reader and love thrillers and all types of fiction, especially historical.  This book takes place in New Zealand and Australia and the history related to those areas wasn't interesting to me.  If someone does have interest in those places than this book would most definitely be entertaining but just wasn't to me.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This was an unexpected pleasure.  Extremely well written and inspirational, regardless of one's gender. I had put off getting this (Kindle version) because I figured it would qualify primarily as &#34;chick lit&#34; -- after all, it was featured on Oprah's Book Club, right??  Well, I'm glad I overcame my chauvinistic prejudice and took the plunge into this amazing journey with Ms. Strayed.  Every page continues a nugget or two of hard-earned wisdom, and the writing is so crisp and clear that you can almost feel what Cheryl experienced with each new day on the PCT.  Part memoir, part adventure story, part travelogue, and all very good.  The heart and soul of the book are the friendships Cheryl strikes up along the trail.  When her PCT journey ended (at Bridge of the Gods on the Columbia River) I felt sad, wishing she had extended her adventure up through Washington state.  Cheryl had become my friend and my mentor.<br />Only negative I can think of are the comments/underlines by Oprah herself throughout the book (Kindle edition); although they really aren't all that intrusive.  Also, some photos would have been great.  But you can find those on Oprah's Book Club website.  Cheryl in her mid-20s looks almost exactly how I imagined her to look.  And the photos of her mom (Barbara aka Bobbi) are great, too!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|used it for my android phone and kindle fire. your pictures will not look the same each time you use this app. A lot of great options.
B00BKZUVGM|5.0|Bravo Ms Roth, Bravo!<br />You took the leap and told a story that needed telling - what war is really like, and how devastating the loss of loved ones can be for those left behind. Despite the negative feedback from many of your readers, I'll let you know, they won't forget your story in a hurry. And that's the point!<br />It wasn't the ending I wanted, but it was an ending I needed. Needless to say, I hugged my husband very hard that night after I finished the series.<br />Thank you.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It is very well written and keeps one engaged following the different lives unfolding. I looked forward to reading to see what would next happen and how each person's story affected the other lives. Hadn't felt that with my last few books.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|Was just Brilliant, loved it was great price if your a fan would recommend this. Loved the war Doctor in the movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the game so much it's better than temple run or subway suffers<br />I play it all day long
B00AFROVQC|1.0|Read at your own risk! Books are poorly written and the timeline leaves much to be desired.<br />Chapters throughout the series are very short, average of about 4 pages. Please dont trust<br />The high star reviews, they are very misleading. I don't usually write reviews however I feel<br />that people should be warned before they waste their money and time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this is a AMAZING game plus to make it more fun I suggest using minecraft pocket edition edited free .great fan totally worth seven bucks
B0029LX2LC|5.0|It's the Roots, they never disappoint . The album has a great mix of songs from fast pace to slow and thought provoking in the Roots style. If you're a Roots fan, then get this album, It's great.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Well I was really excited when I got this app but it does not even have every thing that it said it had if I were you I would not buy this<br /><br />I
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|My 2 1/2 year old son loved Monsters Inc. so I was so excited for this to come out! My husband and I love it and so does our 5 year old daughter and 2 1/2 year old son. We laughed the entire way through--we love all the new characters! We probably buy one kids' movie a year and this was our choice for this year! So far we have watched it 6 or 7 times and we aren't tired of it yet!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is so  fun but also this game gets really hard after awhile but your Facebook friends could help
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great book.  It was a little slow at the beginning but then I was hooked and couldn't put it down.  This was an interesting story that kept you guessing.  Really enjoyed it!
B00BN3DPQ4|4.0|Arnold Schwarzenneger's return to big screen action (if you don't count his cameos in The Expendables movies) really didn't create much of a stir when it was released last Winter.  I caught up with it on blu-ray the other night and it is an enjoyable little flick, certainly not top-tier Schwarzenneger.<br />Arnold plays the police chief of a small town located near the Mexican border.  A former member of the L.A.P.D., he has survived a shootout that killed several of his friends.  He just wants a little peace and quiet.  This ends when a Mexican drug kingpin escapes (in a rather implausible manner) from the incompetents of the FBI who are bringing him to prison for execution.  He speeds towards Arnold's town in a souped-up Corvette at speeds of 200 MPH while his army of mercenaries builds a bridge for him to speed into Mexico.  The FBI, 2 vehicles of SWAT police and assorted other cops can't stop him..  It is up to Arnold and his very limited police department and the film builds towards its High Noon climax.<br />Lets face it, the plot is of the made-for-tv variety.  It is on the big screen because of the return of Arnold, the greatest action star of the '80s and '90s, after his disappointing stint as Governor of California.<br />Jackass star Johnny Knoxville was mistakenly listed as Arnold's co-star on posters when this film was released.  This is not correct, as his rather obnoxious role was a limited one.<br />The picture and sound on the blu-ray were fine.  There are deleted and extended scenes.  There are some featurettes on the making of this film.  In them, Arnold's co-stars mostly talk about how thrilled they were to work with a living legend while Arnold himself slobbers on about how thrilled he is to work with the films brilliant and &#34;visionary&#34; Korean director.  (The director speaks no English and subtitles are used when he speaks.)<br />Look this film is no Terminator, Total Recall, Commando or Predator.  It is a well-done and enjoyable action film and a welcome-return to the big screen for Arnold Schwarzenneger, a lot older and tireder looking than when we last saw him in Terminator 3.  But still able to hold his own in the brutal fight scene with the main villain that concludes this film..  If you like Arnold, you will enjoy this film.  If you don't like Arnold, you may still enjoy it anyway.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|As others have pointed out, the ChromeCast works seamlessly with my iPhone 4S, my iPad 2, my HP desktop, and my HP laptop.  By adding Hulu+, and along with my Networks account, I cancelled my $150 cable for $20 after an additional on time investment of $35 dollars!!  And I got ChromeCast via free shipping.  Definitely worth the $35 it costs....and much more!!  I love it!!!!
B00B5HQLMI|1.0|Main characters tear around scenic Istanbul without regard for the rich historic fabric of that vibrant city. Many motorists and street vendors in the vicinity were also inconvenienced. I found myself stressing the whole time about the insurance implications!
B0029VUV70|5.0|Powerful movie. Not a feel good type, but filled with compassion for all the roles involved in this gem. Outstanding actors within their character roles. There is no one victorious in this movie. Does not disappoint.
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|Just read Galactic Energies. Brilliant, thought provoking stories, thoroughly enjoyable and engaging to the end. They offer twists and turns that could not be foreseen. I think everyone should read them. Luca Rossi has become my new favorite author.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Liesel is the book thief and she's a lot more. Her perceptions are a bit cloudy at first but quickly become sharp and insightful as she survives in war-torn Germany. All of the characters are carefully drawn and they all work to make this an unforgetable story. The setting is always poverty-ridden and that doesn't change as the plot expands. By placing a focus on the terrified and confused citizens of Germany, the writer has shown us a more realistic world than the usual military-focused tales of this time. And, having the Devil (or at least the Grim Reaper) as the narrator caps the whole work off in the best of ways. Buy it. Read it. Enjoy it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun game, but addictive. Levels get increasingly complex as the player advances. There is a methodology for every level though.

B00FSBW2L6|5.0|The Black Eagle Inn by Chrisotph Fischer is an epic family drama spanning generations. Set against the backdrop of World Wars One and Two and the nascent new republic of post war Germany, Fischer weaves a story of familial and political competition and infighting within this small family dynasty. Anna is the matriarch of a family that owns a farm in Bavaria. The farm in turn, incorporates a Country Inn: The Black Eagle Inn. Markus and Lukas, her nephews are locked in a war of wills over both money and social perspective.<br />Much more than plausible, the interplay of characters has the quality of authenticity that makes for a very compelling read.  One could easily image that Fischer is revealing the grimy details of his own family history. His characters are by turns flawed and heroic and collectively they portray an intelligent glimpse into the human condition.  There is triumph and tragedy in every page of this story. Many social issues ranging from religious dogma and racism, to homophobia are explored through its rich cast of characters.<br />Don’t look for saints or villains here. Everyone moves with the conviction of their beliefs and circumstances. Every character allows themselves excuses and justifications that one can not only understand but sympathize with. Through them all collectively, Christoph Fischer expresses a seasoned and mature perspective. In the end there is only a glimpse into the lives of people who once lived or who may have lived. The passage of time washes away all importance but locked into the world of their erstwhile existence they collectively create that world and are impacted by it. This is a rich and fascinating read!
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|Fantastic praise and worship music. What an uplifting message, and great songs that the entire family can listen to.<br /><br />Love that Israel Houghton is also on this CD, he is fantastic.<br /><br />So many top songs, like Victor's Crown, and the DVD (video) is interesting to watch too.<br /><br />If you want powerful, upbeat, praise and worship music, this is a must-have.
B003XRELGQ|5.0|A most thoroughly enjoyable book! A MASTERPIECE IN ITSELF!! I could relate it to many places,and people. I would recommend it to any one who likes biting satire! A beautiful journey through time and space!

B000O8OTNC|3.0|It works OK as far as these pull things go. I got it mostly for the small diamond file, which is good for serrations. It's in my emergency kit.<br /><br />The pull sharpeners will put a cutting edge on you blade in an emergency, but it's better to learn how to sharpen properly with a stone. If you use this as a regular sharpenener, it will mangle the edge of the blade into a sort of rough serration.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Best bingo game ever! Wish I could play off line. Fun for all ages. Must have for tablets!! Good game.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|This is a nice knife for the money. Perhaps too big and heavy for general camping use, but it is lighter than a hatchet, and big enough to split wood. Seems to be well made, and I find it very comfortable. It is what it is, and looks like it can take plenty of abuse.<br /><br />It came very dull, which was a little inconvenient. The parang style blade made it impossible to sharpen on my waterstone. I used wet or dry sandpaper stuck to a stick instead.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Challenging game with good graphics and an interesting story line.  Has mini games that are also challenging, overall a fun game.
B00C7L8DM2|2.0|This is more or less a made-for-T.V. movie.  I am glad I watched at home, where it was a matter of reaching for the remote to make it disappear.

B006RXPTNM|5.0|I love Meryl Streep and think she is one of the most capable actresses, and she certainly did not disappoint.  In this movie, she plays the role of a strict old fashioned school principle that demonstrates how she cares for her students by risking it all when she suspects foul play by the assigned priest.  It is an epic battle between a strong woman fighting for justice in a truly patriarchal society, where men invented a chain of command that serves and protects men regardless of the standards these men try to uphold.

B007EECSFA|5.0|This was a selection from my book club and although I didn't pick it, I couldn't be happier we read it. It was slow and a little confusing at the beginning but stick with it! I promise you will not be disappointed. It really does make you look at your life and those older than you and wonder &#34;what were their dreams?&#34; This is a touching story of the bonds between mothers and daughters, friends and true love. It is a great read!!!
B007R11DKQ|5.0|Very entertaining enjoyable film.  The whole family watched.  This was a heart warming story with lots of humorous scenes.  The film was very well done.  I definitely would recommend.

B0096HFOZO|3.0|I read a very entertaining book this week.  It was The Twits by Roald  Dahl.  I enjoyed this book immensely.  I had several laughs while reading this short fiction book.  My first reaction while reading The Twits was that of utter disgust due to the vivid descriptions of strange behavior exhibited by the characters in this story. Despite my initial reaction, I had several laughs and recommend reading The Twits.<br />  The Twits is about two people called the Twits who are a super mean couple.  Mr. and Mrs. Twit do not seem to like each other very much because they both have ugly thoughts about each other.  Mr. Twit played a terribly mean trick on Mrs. Twit by making her think she was shrinking and convinced her to do whatever he said in order to fix her shrinking problem.  After, anchoring her to the ground and then tying 40,000 balloons to her, he released the anchor, which allowed her to float up into the sky.  After a few days of floating around, she lands on Mr. Twit only to find him relaxing and drinking while lounging in his lawn chair.  They played several mean tricks on each other similar to this throughout the book, displaying their dislike for each other.<br />My favorite part of The Twits was when the couple’s pet monkeys and the birds that live outside around their house gang up on Mr. and Mrs. Twit and glue all of their furniture to the ceiling.  When the crows were putting up the glue, they spilled some of the leftover glue on their heads so when they went into the house they became glued to the floor while trying to sit in the furniture that had been glued to the ceiling.<br />  I recommend reading this book because you get a lot of laughs from it.  It also makes you thankful to not have people in your life that are so mean to each other.  Or if you do have people who treat each other like Mr. and Mrs. Twit then maybe this book will help you know how to deal with them.  Get the glue out!
B004LROUW2|4.0|This is a fascinating story - very involved and convoluted. If it was better paced - it bogs down at about the three-quarter mark - would have given it five stars.
076790592X|5.0|This book changed my life and made me cry more than once! So many great lessons can be learned from this book.
B00BSBVJVE|5.0|It is SO cute! I love this charming little cat and her little friend! Can't wait for the next Pusheen book!
0143038419|5.0|I LOVE this book. The author is hilarious and describes things the way I feel I would (with sarcasm and wit). Very fun to read and makes you want to travel the world.
B005FDWM6M|5.0|Best movie we have seen in years! Great family movie about believing & keeping a good attitude, no matter what your circumstances look like.
1451696191|5.0|Excellent book! Saw the movie first and it was so profound for me. The book is just as wonderful and really makes you re evaluate your life and think back on your high school days and first love.
B00FGFVMGA|3.0|it'a an interesting game with challenging puzzles, but too short. Maybe more maps and more puzzles will make it a great game.
B00E00P5JC|5.0|My boys love this movie. They are ages 8,10.12. Very funny and fast paced. We recommend it for your family.
0061564893|5.0|great.  interesting , informative and well written.  nice that the knowledge of zheng he and the chinese is getting out.
0694013013|5.0|I love this book for the 18 mos-3 year olds I work with as an SLP. A lot of my therapy kiddos aren't too interested in books, or will only look at books that have a &#34;function&#34; (e.g. lift-the-flap books, touch/feel books, or books with sounds). I show them the gorilla on the cover, then thump my chest and make a gorilla sound. Usually that will get any kid's attention, even kids with poor eye contact / autism spectrum type behaviors.<br /><br />For the hard-core book-dislikers, it usually takes a few tries where we might just look at a few pages, but eventually I can even get them interested. Each page of this book has a different animal moving a different body part-- and a picture of a kid doing the same thing. The kids can imitate you doing the movement, or some kids will even look at the picture and copy the animal or kid. (For my purposes, it's even better when the kids listen to and follow verbal directions to do the movement, but most of the kids I see need the visual cues along with instructions.) Some of the pictures are more fun than others. The first few (penguin turning his head, giraffe bending his neck) aren't too exciting-- and, for the kids who need convincing to be interested in the book, I sometimes skip ahead. My therapy kids especially like the gorilla, the donkey (kicking behind him), and the elephant (stomping). I've also seen this book used successfully with large groups of preschoolers at daycares. It's a great book for moving around and for learning body part vocabulary and some verbs.
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|a re imagining of one of the most beloved cult horror films of all time. Doesn't hit the status of the old, but accomplishes what it sets out to do.
B000002KOJ|5.0|Unbelievable talent for such a young girl (sixties album).  Soulful, deep and moving songs.  I have purchased this album as a gift numerous times, including within the last year for SDSU college students (old enough to be &#34;new&#34; to them).
B005HSL626|5.0|This app is absolutely great! fruit ninja is a great time killer. and you can also update it! did i mention its highly addictive! and the best part is its free (for now) get this app before they make you start paying for it!
B002B79BVO|5.0|... I didn't start watching MadMen on the TV until several seasons in.  So, I bought several seasons so I could catch up.  Enjoy it very much.
B005C4ERHQ|5.0|This is simple and positive book. What a revolutionary concept! Focusing on my natural strengths rather than on my natural short comings.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun! But I only have one complaint: it's too easy for me. One time I got over 14,000 coins in just one round. But other than that, it's super fun! :)
1934030597|5.0|This book doesn't leave out anything!!!  If you know nothing (like me), this is the book to buy.  Easy instructions with illustrations to guide you in your repairs or otherwise.
0553801473|1.0|I was lead to believe this was a different book when I already had this book with a different cover
B00005ASGG|5.0|John Wayne, James Stewart need we say more? I always need to eat a steak during the in the resturaunt scene.
0800141849|1.0|The movie itself is fine.  However, I'm very disappointed that this was not the widescreen version for this movie.  It was cleverly hidden by the seller, Amazon, that this was the Full Screen version.  The description &#34;full screen&#34; needs to be updated to today's standard of wide screen TV's anyway.  It's no longer appropriate to mean the old format of 4:6 ratio.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Loved this book from the beginning to the end.  Thank you Christina Baker Kline for mixing in my summer home in Maine.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome with a side of awesomeness is in this book if you like hunger games the first book you will like the 2 and the 3 books
0525478817|5.0|This book is excellent, Holt McDougal is an excellent author! I have read all of Holt McDougals books. Some of my favorites include &#34;Party Time In Your Pants&#34; and &#34;The Adventures Of Candy In Your Pants&#34;. He wrote Party Time In Your Pants at a very vulnerable time in his life while he was up in Canada looking for Alaska and you can really feel that emotion in his writing. There is an abundance of Katherines also spread out in his writing, probably because of his intimate relationship with (now passed) Katherine McDougal who was legally his sister.<br />This excellent sequel continues the adventures of Candy in the paper towns that were created by Mrs. Manlove (also now passed). Candy meets a young boy called Grayson. The real question this book asks it's young reads is Will Grayson... Will Grayson finally find love? I'm sorry that was hard for me to type. It just makes me so emotional. That question is answered in this text in a very satisfying way, with his frankly gorgeous style of writing I have no doubts that Hold McDougal is the only one who could have pulled this off. At the end of the book there is a very beautiful moment where Candy Stripcakes announces &#34;Ah heck. Let it snow!&#34; and I think that about sums up this review. In the words of Candy (Holt McDougal) Let it Snow! And may the Zombiecorns never win the war for banks island.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|Fun game but it's bad for Kindles since u can only have two fingers on the screen at once so I couldn't plug the wholes in the moose's body, and when I tried to blow on the screen to make the man in the air plane fly it didn't work. Amazon really needs to improve this app.
B006O5YIMQ|3.0|The first 15 minutes of the movie it had to buffer every minute or so, and half the time it would crash while buffering.  After this it worked alright, only buffering/crashing 2 more times.  We were watching on the Xbox One so the software may just have some bugs or something, but we also experience this issues sometimes on our Samsung Smart TV with the native app on the TV.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The book kept me intrigued to see how the story would play out from book 1 to 3.  Having said that, there was no need to have 3 books to complete the characters.  The author could have shortened it a lot, and the book would still have kept my attention.
0743270754|5.0|Outstanding in every way if you love history, politics, and Abraham Lincoln. The author has done amazing and comprehensive research here. Although lengthy, it's worth the time and effort, and reads like a great novel.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|As noted in the book 2 review, the author could have shortened the story and not drawn it out so much.  Having said that, I wanted to see how the story would play out among the characters so I read all three.
B00B6OEDS4|5.0|Luscious vocals and full-bodied sound, this duo is a mix between Sade and the XX.<br />Catchy and easy to listen to.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|My husband made a cradle for my Granddaughter.  I used these to put on the cradle to make it a &#34;princess&#34; cradle.  She loves the cradle.  They look great.  She lives in an apartment and the ones we had left are now on her wall above her bed.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|I was a little wary of a remake to the Superman films,as I thought the older films with Christopher Reeves were great.  This film is AWESOME and I love Henry Cavill as &#34;The Man of Steel and Amy Adams as Lois Lane.&#34;  I also love how the producer handled the back story.  Yes, it's a little bit different from the Reeves Superman, but it turns out that's not a bad thing!
B00B1LN8WY|5.0|This series has always been a family favorite.  So glad we now own the whole series.  Our family watched the Thanksgiving episodes this past week - so funny!
B003UESJ9W|5.0|I love the actors and great singing. I saw the movie and had to own it. I will watch it several more times.
B003O86FMW|4.0|More than I expected.  Better plot and ending than expected.<br />I usually shy away from both popular books as well as trilogies.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Wow. Just wow. I literally just finished this book seconds ago, and my heart is pounding. Definitely a girly romance, but not cheesy in any way. Beautiful. Highly recommend. Wow.
B00H1O47D4|5.0|Best WD episode so far!  Did the baby survive?  no one knows.  at least the Governor is dead... but i kinda wish he turned into a walker so that they could kill him a second time.
B007RX32XK|5.0|This is the most interesting, unusual take on new and contemporary music I've heard for awhile!  It's inspired and the harmonies are wonderful and unusual.  So original!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is very captivating.  Once you start you can't stop.  I love it.  This game is good for all ages.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Buy this game! IT'S FREE! If you're patient and visit everyday u get rewards without having to spend a dime!
B00BU18U82|5.0|awesome game and u people who say that its hard to steer its not u just need to select bar steering not gyroscope
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I think littlest pet shop is a great app for four and up.  If you want a cute heart warming little game this is the game for you.
B000URWYTS|5.0|I have loved FLW and his work my whole life and there was so much I didn't know about him!  This book really brought him to life and what a sad story.  But he still designed wonderful buildings and homes.  A friend of mine lived in one of his prairie homes in Wilmette, IL.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Phenomenal from start to finish, with an ending that I never saw coming, that tied the very first chapter to the last.<br /><br />Looking forward to the next one.
B00BAXFECK|3.0|There was no redemption in this novel.  It started with a sad, horrific scene and they kept getting more and more sad.
006202406X|4.0|SPOILER ALERT<br />-<br /><br />-<br /><br />-<br /><br />-<br /><br />-<br /><br />Yes, it's heartbreaking. I did not expect or want this ending. But Patrick Rothfuss has said that the best books break your heart. I wasn't sure what to think when I read that (and it makes me nervous to read the third book of his trilogy!), but this book sheds some light on it for me. Veronica Roth made us care so much for her main characters that we mourned when one of them died and another had his heart (figuratively) ripped apart. She touched our hearts. She showed us that sometimes the most valuable things require the most heartbreaking sacrifices, and that these sacrifices are actually worth it.<br /><br />Veronica Roth explains the ending in her 10/28/13 blog post. It's very worth reading. She makes it clear that her loyalty is to the story, and to her themes, not to her readers' happiness, because there is no way for her to please ALL her readers. Does this mean she doesn't care about her readers? Of course not! Read the appreciation page in the book; read her blog. She is so thankful for her readers.<br /><br />She does not, however, owe us the ending we wanted! I prefer a writer who stays true to the story, rather than only trying to please readers. We end up with stories that show us the author's heart, instead of stories that are written to please readers' fantasies and pad the author's wallet.<br /><br />Did I want a happier ending? Oh, absolutely. But do I wish Roth had given it to me? No. I don't wish she had laid her vision down on the altar of my happiness. That would have been truly tragic.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|the product is easy to install and use. Tough there is some lag in the picture being displayed on the connected device - the videos are sharp and the sound clear.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best game ever made.I love it so much don't matter how much money it is GET IT :) Ok this was from my 9yr old at the time. I will admit he clearly has played the heck out of this game and it is still going strong. They seem to update it quite frequently and he hasn't had any issues with game play. I guess you could say it was a good buy and has entertained him on many a road trips to Grandma's house.<br /><br />Please feel free to ask any questions to my review in the comment section and I will try to quickly respond. I hope my review has been supportive, enlightening, or maybe just entertaining for you. My goal is to continue to help other Amazon shoppers make informed purchasing decisions in the sea of choices available. Thank you for taking the time and reading my review!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|What can one day but that this book is one of the greatest classics ever written.  God bless us, everyone!
B003MC5N28|5.0|Loved it. Wish the ending provided a little more clarity though.  I Was expecting to find out what &#34;elsewhere&#34; was.
B00GIXWXEO|4.0|It could if been a little more funnier but it was a great family movie to watch w the kids and i will recommend for family w children to wach.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really enjoyed the characters' intertwined back stories.  There were plenty of twists in the plot to keep you guessing.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|It was a great family movie, that had me laughing and its a for sure purchase. i recomend for all.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|always simple to use. brings up choices even I did not think of. very user friendly and easy to navigate
B004HWYTP4|4.0|It had a lot of action it kept the.  Thrill going that had me wanting to pay attention, and wacthing a second time
B0067R0APK|3.0|more difficult to navigate from home setting to other favorite settings. with weather channel you can swipe left to right to see all your favorites one at a time. too much black and white readability is not enhanced and the over done black and white areas make it all look and feel dull and boring.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Lots to love about candy crush but this app won't update fast enough...there are many requests I get on th that don't show up here fir hours or sometimes days later.
B00GLX0Z8C|4.0|Please quit ruining good movies with the filthy language that absolutely does nothing for the movie.Hollywood clean up your act, dadgumit!!!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Perndergast has always seemed to be a weird driven character.  This book made him into a super=hero which surprises me that I liked.  I loved this book.
B009AMANBA|4.0|An Interesting character study but very dark film and hard to get into.  At first I thought no I don't enjoy this, but by the time it was finished I thought this is a very good film
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I read this when it was rhe rage and it was okay but the sex didn't sound like anything I had missed.  It was just different.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game was a lot of fun.  Looking forward to playing the next level.  Love Big Fish.  They make high quality hidden games.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|It was a good read but not as good as some John Grisham has written.  Some characters were a little too predicable.
B00FWLTPU8|4.0|I RENTED this movie to  watch during a flight. It was better than I thought it was going to be. The action was good as well as the story line. I grew up Ultraman, Godzilla, Marin Boy and etc so for me it was a good movie.
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|Loved the movie, it's hilarious & has a great story line. Would give it 5 stars, except there's way more foul language than necessary.
B008602KQI|4.0|i liked it , it was a good movie. had a lot of action in it and was always moving with more action
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Nice streaming radio app, the best of it's kind that I've tried. Occasionally drops connection for no apparent reason, and wish there weren't so many clicks to start your favorite stations. Widgets would be great for this!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The game is very addictive. Very enjoyable and challenging. There are levels that you may be stuck on for days and even weeks..
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|2 days ... still cant manage to find my WiFi.  Im sure it will be great if I can get it to connect
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is a great way to spend free time. It is also a great way to further procrastination. I do not advise playing this game before doing homework, because the homework will not get finished. But overall, a very fun game: great graphics, sound effects, etc.
B004DHUAZQ|4.0|Good action adventure. Sly still has some good stuff. Great supporting cast of &#34;stars&#34; that could be leads in other movies.
0307352153|5.0|Great book, I finished reading a library copy and decided to get a copy for keeping on my book shelf.
B00FEHXISA|5.0|Really kicked it up some. Great action and awesome animation. Didn't think I would like the Iron Man movies but I really do
0385737955|4.0|Maze Runner features a protagonist with no recollection of the past, thrust into a strange environment.  As he progresses through the story, memory fragments and background story unfold to suggest a sort of special mission in a post-apocalyptic, dystopian world.<br />First part of a trilogy, I have not read the next books, but plan to.<br />After reading it, passed the novel to my 13 year-old who devoured it in a couple days.<br />The story is a danger/thriller mystery with some violence.
B00COGY2P2|3.0|Pretty good action but as is the trend. Tom isn't as good as he use to be. Still enjoyable. Just not the level you expect from a Cruise movie. Tom was still good, story just not at the super star level. In the end though, I will watch it again down the road.
B003NJXO94|4.0|This is a nonfiction novel of a Esquire magazine war correspondent in Vietnam and his experiences in Hue and Khe Sahn.  It's much better than, say, Matterhorn, as it names names and places and hence historically accurate.  Herr' s writing style reminds me of Tom Wolfe.  The content is the Vietnam equivalent of Helmet for My Pillow or With the Old Guard from WW 2, told by by someone who was in the thick of combat.  Herr consulted on the movies Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket and some of the scenes in both movies are lifted directly from this book.  If you liked those movies you'll like this book.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|First of the GI Joe movies I have watched. Super cast of &#34;Good Guys&#34; that puts the ACTION in action/adventure. Will be checking out some other GI Joe movies now.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|A recent winner of the Nobel. Her vison of the emotional interchanges between men and women is deeply moving.Highly recommended
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I love these people. They are proper English while being sharp tongued and funny. The clothes are amazing!  The women make the show.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Great for netflix and YouTube streaming. But I honestly brought the item wishing I could view personal videos, pictures and other non YouTube sites
B004W2V254|4.0|a good subtitled movie of hardship and determination. It is a story of prewar Germany and has just enough NAZIs in it to make it interesting. A little long in some of the brutal climbing scenes but then hanging on the North Face of the Eiger is pretty long and tiring too.
B00ECW9UJY|5.0|This is such an excellent movie. Some of the scenes can be scary but the overall movie is really good. Thank You.
B00CCXL9OE|5.0|I was a little worried that the bluray might not work as this is a region free blu ray which appears to be imported from the UK. However, it played flawlessly in my Samsung blu ray player.  the picture quality is fantastic.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Very moving film. Not what I expected, but the story was compelling and while not as much action as I had hoped for, it was definitely worth seeing. This is more of an emotional drama with some very hard to watch scenes. Denzel pulled it off in remarkable fashion and there are quite a few moments where I wanted to yell at the screen.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This was a sleeper.  Excellent.  Characters, actors, and story. I'm not a film critic. I don't pick apart movies for errors in what city or train station, they call it, or what vintage typewriter or car that is used.  Make it close enough and tell a good story and play it well, is all I need.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Would have liked more story in the middle.  But that' how I always feel at the end so a Stephen King story.
B000ID1J0E|1.0|Bought it as a requested gift.  Now I question the recipient's values.  My guess is that even Johnny Depp doesn't like to talk about it.
B00A285OOW|2.0|Not very gripping.  The queen seemed content with constantly being ignorant of the court and the king/his mother were annoying and shallow.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Fun but frustrating that I have to wait X amount of time before beginning again when I've failed at the challenge.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I really liked this game. My sister told me about it and she finally did something right. Okay graphics Awesome gameplay
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I love all the different ways to create your specific characters! It's also has a great story line. Lots of game time. Keith T..
B005NFVZTM|5.0|I loved it! Great story that filled in many blanks for the other parts of this series. Awesome special effects too! I first watched it thru Amazon instant video as a free gift with my purchase. Im very glad that I have this coming on DVD!
B008K8VDPU|3.0|This is a little fun, through you can do to much and the keyboard is only partly shown, It is still cute and fun, and great for a child to play around with for a few minutes.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|This story does not have as much dialogue as Jane Austen's other stories, but is more of a narrative. This does not make it any less of a story. If you have enjoyed other Jane Austen stories than add this to you list!
B00G21XNKU|5.0|THE DOCTOR IS, WITHOUT A DOUBT, THE BEST TIMEY-WIMEY LIMEY EVER TO TUNNEL THROUGH THE COSMOS IN A BLUE BOX.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Buggy and marginal quality.<br />Save your money and go with a Roku or Apple TV. You'll be happy you did.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game except for level 14 I keep on getting stuck on it but the candy hammer really helps.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|This was a creepy adventure story. I definitely didn't read it in the dark, but it was more about the suspense of events than the actual terror or ghoulishness of the story. I recommend it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is great fun and on my kindle fire it works perfect. this is on of the best apps ever.
B00BQ4NLC8|1.0|I think, this is a really shallow and boring book, which has nothing in common with literature or what I consider literature.
B003A6X0P8|4.0|The main reason I have given this release as many as 4 stars is that I am very pleased to have a document of the first concert I ever attended (back when I was the ripe age of 13).  For those of you who are clear on the history of Deep Purple, this concert took place during the tour after Ritchie Blackmore had left the band.  Tommy Bolin was an acceptable replacement, but nowhere close to the abilities of Blackmore.  Also, this concert took place less than a month from the band's final concert, so things may have been a bit strained.  Either way, I'm glad I attended the concert and I'm glad to have the CD.  There are some fairly good versions of some great songs, but this recording is nowhere near &#34;Made in Japan.&#34;  You may want to forward the ten minute guitar solo, boring.  I can still remember people sitting near me at the concert joking about wanting to throw a tomato (may Tommy rest in peace).  I mistakenly submitted a review under my wife's name, so I hope I got this one right.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I don't like games that I have to be &#34;connected to the internet&#34; to play. it uses my internet time. I like games that I do not have to be connected to play.  Afterall, I pay for these games, I should be able to play them anytime, anywhere.
098357670X|5.0|An Excellent book by a master caricaturist. His style of art is beautiful and unique. He takes you step by step to create your own<br />caricatures...and by following his work you can get to know how he arrives at his own masterpieces...and you in turn can create<br />something similar. Hundreds of samples. Value for money. Book was scheduled to arrive at my address before Christmas...but I received it end of Nov.<br />Thanks Amazon. VicFoo (Australia)
B003477DVK|3.0|It is a cute film about a boy and his dog. While it may be a corny theme it is well done and quite watchable. We enjoyed it.
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|This is the 4th or 5th time I have watched this movie.  I really like the color.  It goes very well with a book I am now reading about the U-505.  I read another many years ago, about destroyer action in WWII and the capture of U-505..  Das Boot brings everything to life! It is too bad that Das Boot ended as it did however.
B006PYHYXG|5.0|Got 2 LX of which one is the OEM HP.  Work on both.  I got the used one from Tiger Supply.  Cheaper and like new!
140006922X|2.0|Even though he is not a Christian, his research is very thorough and gives us Christians plenty to think about. This book creates strong doubts about whether Jesus was really born in Bethlehem.
B000URWYTS|3.0|Any architecture buff will appreciate the ups and downs of being forward thinking.  A real look into the life of a very<br />difficult personality and talent.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|I love all of his books. As a journalist myself, I've found his research to be impeccable and the conclusions and interpretations to be fascinating.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book and movie SO MUCH! I cant wait tell the Mocking Jay movie! This book was good because I never got bored, from the tour, to the arena, to the explosions, to the weather it was just all amazing!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It is a great book for anyone older than 10. This book has a lot of action and romance in this book.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I live using this app. It is easy to figure stuff out. The one thing aI cant figure out is the &quot;clone &quot; button. I saw it was offered on a YOUTUBE video yet I cant find. Bummer.
1465414444|5.0|Stunning artwork accompanied by thorough and well-organized text makes this a must-have item for the WoW enthusiast.<br /><br />I expected great art; afterall that's one of the aspects of the overall game that draws in fans.  And I also expected some basic lore and descriptions of races, geograhpical areas, etc.  But I must say I was blown away by the overall presentation.  I feel I am quite knowledgeable about Warcraft lore, having played every game from the original &#34;Orcs vs. Humans&#34; but I still discovered new treasures while reading through this book.  With so much history and lore to draw from, and so many heroes, villains, titans, etc. from WoW history, I worried that there would just be too much data and it might read like an encyclopedia.  But not at all!  There is depth here without a minutia of details and best of all, the &#34;story&#34; that is Warcraft is all layed out for us.<br /><br />I envy those that have still to discover this book for the first time.  Outstanding job to the team that brought this project to completion!
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|The book was good at the end.  I almost stopped reading it at times though because it seemed to drag.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I guess I may have expected it to be as incredible as The Shining. Maybe because I'm older and it's harder to scare me, thank you Mr. King. Of course it was great. It shows King still has it. I have to mention his ability to scare has been handed down to his son, Joe Hill. If you haven't read Heart Shaped Box yet, prepare for scary.
B00AGE20ZI|4.0|Cary Grant is charming! Loretta Young is lovely. A very enjoyable Christmas classic. Worth the watch just to enjoy the time when movie going was a spectator event meant to please. No pyrotechnics necessary.
B006BFK5DK|5.0|Earth Wind & Fire are one of our favorite groups.  This CD did not disappoint.  My husband keeps playing it and already has committed most of the songs to memory!
B001DUDKEY|5.0|Persuasion doesn't get the same hype as some of the other notable Jane Austen classics. More's the pity. The women have been cast perfectly, each bringing a rich character interpretation. Amanda Root can tell all with her eyes and Sophie Thompson is a delight. Chivalry looks wonderful in uniform. In classic Austen style viewers wonder if love will win in the end through all the distraction and missed chances and they are not disappointed. I watched it countless times.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Honestly, I don't play this but my kids ages 10, 7 and 4 all love to play.  I like that they are building things and being creative - they come up with some amazing building creations!
B00DNO2LFC|5.0|What a treasure! Harvey Keitel astounds with a notable dramatic performance where he's not a thug. Deserving of every award it received. Sam Neill, also playing a somewhat different character for him rose brilliantly to the challenge. I was enthralled that this always handsome and appealing man was cast as such a hard to like character - great tension in his presence. Anna Paquin may have peaked at this tender age. I've not seen an equal performance from her since. Signature role for Holly Hunter. An ambitious undertaking for any actor, yet her 'script' interpretation soared through her eyes, her face, her hands and her musical delivery of the score. She absolutely devoured this role. There should never be a remake. It could never come close. Watch it!!
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|love everything about this show.  This movie was great quality and really enjoyed catching up on the seasons.  Love Jax!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The Weather Channel has always been the best place to get weather updates and forecasts. Their app is exceptionally functional on all platforms and it is no different here. If you plan on ever going outside, consider this a must have.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|the articulation was better than i expected, and while i did pop one of her pigtails off the first time i swapped faceplates, it went back on easily enough.
B00GP0G0IK|3.0|I enjoyed this game but I agree with other reviewers that it wasn't worth $4.99!  Choosing the ending was kind of cool but playing it a second time to choose the other ending to see what happens?  It will be awhile before I do that. The hints in the game are very helpful because in my opinion it would be very easy to keep getting lost!  All in all it was an ok game but not one of the G5 best!
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Great movie over all. Love the plot...character developement. The main character sells it and makes it believable, the special  effects were pretty good, and the action was enjoyable and I'm pretty critical about movies and especially this new phenomenon of female &#34;tough guys&#34;. Katniss is beleiveable and likeable and you root for her almost from the start.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Without doubt, this series has something for everybody. The characters and storylines are ridden with artful (and often shocking) twists and turns that leave you deeply invested both emotionally and intellectually. The character points-of-view and internal dialogues weave an enchanting web of mystery, fantasy and horror so fascinating that by the end of the fifth book you are having some serious withdrawal issues waiting for George to finish writing the 6th and 7th books in the series.
B0093OGBL6|5.0|Dr. Karen Moriarty's book is a heart wrenching read of a musical genius way before his time. Michael Jackson was so loved  by millions worldwide and yet so very misunderstood. Dr. Moriarty so eloquently delivers the truth. The loneliness that Michael felt inspite of a sea of love and admiration by his fans and close family could not even bring him peace.  If one did not know of the trials and tribulations of this humanitarian, you will cry knowing the endurance that Michael had to bear..... from the &#34;wannabes&#34;, coattail riders, to the cruel injustice the media played on his life.  Keep tissues close by as you read this informative and moving book.
B00DYFCYSO|4.0|I bought this for my sister and she loves this CD, especially the song, &#34;Who do we think we are&#34;.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|An enjoyable read and thought-provoking combination of research and personal stories that make you take another look at how the workplace functions. I appreciated her candor.
B009O07NBQ|5.0|Who doesn't love Howard Shore?! This music is moving yet relaxing. The music connects the LOTR soundtrack but is still unique and shows new songs. I love the male voices that sing Misty Mountains. Love it love it!
B002SJIO5E|4.0|So I got this Blu-ray because I like this movie. I am rooting for the aliens . It is a good action movie too.Some movies you don't get tire off this is one of them.
B0000TAZBK|5.0|I love this music. It's emotional and ethereal. This soundtrack is my first choice to listen to when I'm writing. It inspires my creativity.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I got this just because it's the prequel to Aliens,also I have all the other Aliens movies on Blu-ray,and because I got it for a very good price .It looks good on Blu-ray.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book, just like the first, has kept me engaged from beginning to end. I am excited to jump right into the last book of the trilogy.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I liked the story and the characters and dialogue were real and interesting.<br />I recommend for women  wanting an interesting read with a unique storyline involving layers of characters and stories.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|A lot of fun for a quick download to a phone.  Beats angry birds over and over again.  Definitely a challenge.
B0053KWDES|4.0|Purchased April 13 2013, flat dead December 1 2013. The unit provides a volume boost (about 25%) with distortion at full blast.  It appears sturdy and has a good heft.  Good sound out of it.  I used it about 2x per month for about 3 hrs each time. I wouldn't say I abused it. It suddenly died 8 months after purchase; I never dropped it; it was pampered.  Manufacturer says return to seller. I have a feeling I'm hosed. Would not buy again, would not recommend.<br /><br />Update January 2015 - After the unit died, FiiO had me return it to China for repair.  Shipping to and back from China took about 6-8 weeks.  The FiiO staff were extremely patient and helpful.  After asking for basic info to verify ownership, they approved the RMA.  They sent back a fully functional unit with a new battery.  To date, the amp continues to work flawlessly.  I updated the review to 4 stars based on attentive and excellent customer service, and the reliability of the replacement unit.  I would definitely buy again!
0399161287|5.0|A surprisingly open and honest reflection on theformer undisputed champs life, Tyson is humble, honest, thoughtful and genuinely unflinching as he relays his life story. He pulls no punches especially with himself, sharing his fears, triumphs, tragedies, fall and eventual redemption. While not for the prudish (the book is rife with sexual encounters and a liberal amount of profanity) you'll be hard pressed to find a more honest and reflective bio this year.<br />I dare you to read it and not become a fan of the man. Tydon is a wonderfully introspective and deep human being who has survived gauntlets of the worst human beings have to offer to emerge an optomistic and caring human being despite it.<br />A must read.
B006IGZWB2|4.0|a good story about Mississippi and their help - I would recommend this comedy drama. the acting was excellent also.
B0027MJU00|3.0|DORIANSTUTU<br /> I love Gillian Flynn 's writing style but this was a little TOO cold & bloody for me.<br /> Liked Gone Girl much better. I'll buy another book by her with the hope of less gore.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|We enjoyed this more than any other Superman movie out there!  Even though we knew the story line, this movie revisited Superman's whole life in a quick and meaningful way that was easy to follow to where he ended up.  The special effects were incredible which added a lot to a story told in the movies so many times!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Definition of perfection. I can't wait to buy the next book! Suzanne Collins sure did a great job, no doubt about that.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's fun and very awesome but some levels are just so hard. I really don't see how people get so addictive to the game because all your doing is sliding candy down to either break a jelly or get a match.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Some of the levels get pretty frustrating, especially when the time is very short and the chocolate squares start popping up.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|It helps you learn about the marvelous and merciful thing's that the Lord our God has done for everyone. God bless!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so addicting I can't stop playing it I'm almost done with the game and I just got it today!!!!!!
B000001ESF|1.0|not very good.  rush didnt really do very well on this release..just not really one of their better efforts. just not my taste
B008JDAC7G|1.0|The so called \\"super\\" version of this game is free on the google market. This one, which is a stripped down version of that free game, contains far less game content and the same amount of spyware. 1 star is too good for this tragedy. Shame on you, Adult Swim! And Amazon, please, why?
B00GII9UCW|1.0|come on norah... you can do better than this.... unless revenue is all you want, then get into the bernank business of printing money....
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I think this game is awesome it is fun but it makes you think of what u r going to,next to win and go on to the next level
B008Y6RFBE|5.0|I love this movie !!! This is a very intelligently done action,drama ... All of the actors do a phenomenal job !!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have this app on my kindle and I use it every morning. Reliable and I haven't had any issues with it.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I could not put this book down, and I don't remember the last time that happened.  Thanks, Neil. It's been a fun day.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Aside from the super lag at level 117 (easy mode... Lag actually starts at around level 80 in freeplay mode and I have the galaxy note 2 with the power saving function off) this is a great game and have been playing is since it's flash version days on pc.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|I disliked much of the characters and events in this book and only pursued the end so I will have completed it. But the story took a surprising twist very near the end and I take from it that even the roughest of characters and environments can change into something unexpectedly good.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|I'm a true fan of music, and I must be really moved to purchase someones album, due to all the crap that is out now. This album is true music greatness. Providing musical entertainment for every type of music fan. I'm truly convinced that J.Cole is the rebirth of Nas, and Jay Z replacement.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|I have to get use to this app and figure out its features but so far working good for my needs.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Once you start playing this game you wont want to stop. When you have to you will be counting minutes until your next fix. Best game ever.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Loved the book.  Didn't want to quit reading.  Now I'm wondering what happened with the rest of the True Knot members
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Lots of good twists and turns in plot.  Very true depiction of the South during the time period.  Very good; as Grisham always is.
0385537131|4.0|Just completed Sycamore Row.  Good story but also one with truth to it as in to &#34;A Time To Kill&#34; and The Chamber&#34; .<br />John Grisham has a passion for telling African American issues and at the heart of it questions why hasn't anything been done about these past misdeeds.  John Grisham relates quite a story of murder, racism, and the issue over property which so dominated the South during the Civil War and Reconstruction period of US history.  Numerous African American families lost their lives and their land due to hatred. He asks a great question &#34;how many people were charged with murder of the six hundred lynched Black people, none was the answer, since it was the law of the land and Black folks were fair game&#34;. When Lucien started looking into Seth's family history he stumbled upon a great discovery and I was more than tempted to turn to the end of the book and find out what happened, after all his introduction to the &#34;why&#34; did Seth leave such a large portion of his Estate to an unknown Black woman was a dead give away to what the story was about and also possibly how it would end. I gave it a four rating because the ending seemed rather weak, I would as the author telling this story kept true to Seth wishes and not left his children anything!
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|Liked the free part and  bought to continue. Nice game with good story and minigames. The map shows places where  things have to be done  and let you jump there.
B00538MG6A|4.0|Love love extras. Travolta is a movie star in this film old school style .  It was great to see All players

B004YHRZLM|5.0|Pros: Original; Great Cinematography; Engaging Characters; Entertaining; Informative; High Production Value.  Great Classic Disney Movie! Brings me back to my childhood! I bought this for a Christmas gift for my children and I can't wait to see their little faces as they watch the movie come to life! Great Movie!<br /><br />If my review was helpful please let me know by clicking &#34;YES&#34; below. Also, feel free to ask me any questions about the product you may have. Thank You.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love, love, love! Use this app for everything from keeping info to emailing to taking notes! Do yourself a huge favor and at least check it out!
B000LE1E0K|4.0|I really liked &#34;American Psycho&#34; for its merciless satire of superficial yet generic Wall Street types of the late 1980s. Christian Bale delivered a breakout performance as serial killer/businessman Patrick Bateman.<br /><br />The problem is the video transfer. It's very hit or miss. At times color is satisfactory and detail is reasonably sharp. At other times the picture is soft and colors and shadow detail is flat. The opening titles just don't look good at all, they're soft, yet have halo problems around the lettering -and the image just isn't very steady. The HD transfer appears derived from a HD telecine source. A bit of dirt and debris pop up in the image from time to time. This movie would benefit from a print cleanup and digital intermediate treatment. Unfortunately, this title has limited appeal. So I think chances are slim it will get an improved re-release.<br /><br />Audio Quality - it's decent, but the DTS-HD High Res track doesn't have a whole lot besides dialog and 1980s music to show off.<br /><br />If my review was helpful please let me know by clicking &#34;YES&#34; below. Also, feel free to ask me any questions about the product you may have. Thank You.
B003F48E4W|5.0|A 5 star classic.  The Cadillac of 80s vampire movies. The Frog brothers do not mess around, and neither does Grandpa unless it involves the Widow Johnson.
B00005JM02|5.0|n my opinion, Pixar can do no wrong when it comes to storytelling. Even with state-of-the-art CGI, they never forget that the story is what people care about and i Finding Nemo /i is the best story Pixar has ever told, and the best story the animated world has yet to see. The voices of Albert Brooks, Ellen Degeneres, Willem Dafoe Brad Garrett are some of the all-star talent assembled and are never wasted. Degeneres nearly steals the show as the forgetful Dory, and the Sharks in the AA-type meeting are classic. The turtles are downright hysterical and Pixar has set it s standard a notch higher. Chances are, most of you have seen this movie already and if you haven't - grab this DVD, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />If my review was helpful please let me know by clicking &#34;YES&#34; below.

B004WR125O|5.0|Absolutely the neatest thing since sliced bread! Nothing to set up, and now I can get Pandora, etc. on my receiver!
B007HJ91HU|3.0|I'm twenty something, I've seen tons of dance-movies and I really liked the original. This movie was hit and miss all the way. Some parts were good others felt 'cut in'. The actors...I really don't know what's up with trying to pass off older actors as teens. Doesn't make sense to me. It's bareable sometimes- some people have 'young genes' like the actors in Highschool Musical. But it was painfully obvious these guys were not in Highschool.<br /><br />The second thing is that it's too extreme- in some movies directors/writers will write the most dramatic extreme thing they can think of to keep you watching. It doesn't work, it just feels chaotic from one scene to the next. It lacks that flow that takes you through the story. On top of that it just rushes from one topic to another.<br /><br />Another thing is the music- there have got to be way way better songs than the ones chosen for this movie. A lot of it was just noise. Not even good noise.<br /><br />If you can sit through it- kudos to you. Honestly, an hour into the movie I checked how much time was left and decided not to sit through yet another hour of watching this. At least not tonight, lol. To the point- there are MUCH better movies out there. This is just okay, a very low okay. I definitely don't recommend this for kids- or anyone really. I don't understand the high ratings but to each his own I guess.<br /><br />The first reason I gave it 3 stars is because if the plot, the actors, the overall flow of the movie had been more thought out and refined it could've actually made sense. If it weren't a remake of the original footloose, and just it's own movie it would've been better. The second reason is that SOME of the dancing is good- if you over look the jerking, twerking, and occasional pole dancing, it has some pretty decent steps. Oh yea, the main actor wasn't too bad- kudos to him!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The game is good and  challenging.  Right now I am at a Level (70) that I think is next to impossible.  Been on it for a few days.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Great workout video. There is a lot of up and down up and down. I prefer to do my up exercises then my on the ground exercises. But that is just me. It is a good video. Love Jillian Michaels!!
0399255370|5.0|Great Book!!!  It has a cute twist from the crayons perspective and also has a good lesson for children.  I would recommend this book as a cute read for all ages.
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|It's very technical and super well written, especially if you're a science and or military nut. I have learnt so much about the topic of nuclear war through this. Awesome
1401938906|5.0|Great insights on what we are missing! The exercises are simple to do and they show us what is possible!
B0000028WD|5.0|Great song writer, being covered by top performers on a special night.  Makes you wish you were there. My Back Pages is a classic.
B004KRVDDM|5.0|Watch this movie once and you will want to watch it again and again. Funny and yet serious a great mix.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|It is a really cool video to watch if you are a music lover! So many bands made music there and to have the memory kept alive it just great!
B00942S4OY|5.0|Teenage daughter who loves One Direction gives this album two thumbs up! As a parent, I appreciate the fact that so far this group is still profanity and scandal free.
B007RE0RR8|5.0|Bought this for my niece. It's a cute doll for the price! I really think she's going to love it!
B000RLHDUM|5.0|Classic!!! Can watch it over and over again! Who wouldn't want to purchase this movie after seeing it.. No matter how long ago it was made....love it from beginning to the end..
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Everyone I know who gives this series a chance loves it. Great human interest, and very unpredictable. really captures the feeling of England in the 20s and 30s
B004SBQGHS|2.0|I never had ads pop up until I got the ads free version!!! It's very annoying now, it was better before.
0143123173|5.0|if you like Longmire the TV series you'll like this book better. The characters are a little different but the dark humor is the same and the story has a twist ending you can't predict. the locale of Wyoming is also almost a character in itself.
B009GENZKS|1.0|I'm a Resident Evil fan, but I haven't seen any good animations of the francise, and this movie failed to grab my interest aswell. I like the live action movies more.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Great biography of an unknown American hero. Factual, human and engaging. Follows David McCullough's book generally. Adams and his wife are figures worth knowing more about.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What else can I say? One of the best shows ever made...and I'm not that into sci-fi. My husband started watching it and I got hooked! Great cast of characters. Wonderful acting. Phenomenal writing.
B00F8KIJ2I|4.0|Really like this collection.  Still the rebel rocker girl but reached another level of maturity, branched out on some of the cuts.  And I loved the collaboration with Chad.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|very cool game. try it you will like it. it is almost like being out in the woods. you can also take some real awesome shots.
B00DSTBMMU|5.0|Been a fan a long time, this is her best yet in my opinion.  Feels a little country but still all Sheryl Crow.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Fun fame but would like to be able to advance without Facebook. Never been a fan of it but have to have it to continue on.
0142406112|5.0|Great series for kids, mystery, suspense but for teenagers.  My nephew enjoys the entire Alex Rider Series so I have purchased them all for him.
B000001ABD|5.0|This is a great album.  I would highly recommend this one to anyone that likes Stevie Wonder music.  Great then and now.
B0091VYG86|1.0|I 've watched this before and enjoyed it. Its always better the second time around. Great family flick.it gets four star
B007A4SDCG|5.0|The hype is deserved. A very inspiring read that gave me the kick I needed. I would recommend this to any skill level.
B00GH4R95C|4.0|Solid entertainment and pays homage to numerous other Superman films and actors. Occasionally becomes a bit preachy and monotone, but the special effects are great and the actors' performances are solid.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I love the patchwork puzzles. I am spending most of my time sitting in a hospital room with my sick husband.  Patchworks relaxes me without taxing my overloaded brain too much.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|It came with a lovely holiday message and I really loved it! The charger is exactly what I wanted and it works fine! :) Thank you and I hope you have a wonderful holiday also! xoxo
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|At first it worked fine. For unknown reason, it had problem with network setting and I tried several configurations it still did not work.<br />Disappointing.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The Hunger Games is a great movie, and this has great Blu Ray quality.  I'm excited to see the next movie in the series.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Easy way to pass the time either for a few minutes or longer.  Just not enough &#34;lives&#34;  while playing on the cellphone.<br />Just as the game was getting challenging.....Poop!  Out of lives.  Needed to buy more or wait 20-30 minutes to allow<br />the game to boot up.  But fun to play.  Would purchase again.
B003I55BIA|5.0|Couldn't put this one down once I started it... gotta love that whole bad boy / good girl scenario.  Found that the characters were extremely likeable, the plot believable.  Would recommend to anyone!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|J'aime this app it is truly fantastic where was this app when I was in school this app receives 5 stars from me wish I had more stars!!!!
B00EW9GQR6|2.0|Is it just me or do most of the songs on this album sound the same? The only songs I really like on this album are the last three. Dope, Gypsy and Applause. A couple of others like &#34;Do What You Want&#34; are okay... but aren't that great. I was really hoping for something better than Born This Way. If she lives for the applause as she says, I believe she will soon be dead.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Love it!  The storyline is fantastic and the actors are outstanding.  I am blown away by the characters that they portray.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally on the Kindle.  Love this game so much, so happy its finally on something other than iPad. Made my day!
B00CFTA6K8|5.0|My  idea of catching fire was that it defenently leaves you hanging.I wrote this review because i just saw the movie and it was so good and it leaves you hanging there too.My point is the hunger games catching fire was a great book and I will recomend you read it.
B00BAXFECK|3.0|The Goldfinch starts out with a bang but never really continues to excite you. I enjoyed the story but the ending leaves you hanging.
B00F35B8F8|1.0|I expected much more from a Star Trek movie. If it wasn't a Star Trek story it would be laughable.  Because of knowing the other plots you become interested in how they mend together with this one but it could have been done in 15 minutes.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Great Story, and excellent digressions to cover various topics like research into what works best for the human foot, and how our ancient ancestors were able to &#34;run down&#34; game. Very enjoyable reading.
B00C1B28Y2|5.0|Amazing, more than I expect it to be, my brother loves it, I loved it, its so very detail, it make look so real, and is so affordable very happy with it
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Good app, needs a little bit more functionality here and there especially when viewing pictures. Over all easy to use and good for the facebook interface.
B00CIXVAN8|4.0|This was a very good movie it kept me guessing and had a twist I did not see coming. For people who want something to engage your mind.
B00ENBTI8C|5.0|Final season does not disappoint.  The ending was really really hard to watch though. I enjoyed the way the production handled the deaths of several characters! Great
0525952926|5.0|Follett is a masterful story-teller and this book is hard to put down.<br />He continues to create wonderful characters and plots.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This series just keeps getting better. I am loving the new ways the story is being presented. I still love the amazon instant video process, it is great for shows on any night!
B004GYY714|5.0|I listen to CSN International on call letters KAWZ in my area while I use my Kendal. I can't get this station on regular radio in my area. I am very pleased with choice of Tunein Radio, comes in clear and no problems or interruptions.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead is the zombie masterpiece of this century. The plot twists and storyline never dissapoint. The downloading process from amazon is easy and makes it much easier to find a night and time to watch!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Loved the book and love the series!  This helped shed some light on the parts of the series that doesn't make sense and it was an interesting way to read about someone's journey through the prison system.
B0064W67IM|5.0|Perhaps one of my favorite books now in the digital format! I love every part of this series, having it available in a smaller format than my absolute editions is wonderful,and  the digital books are much less intimidating when I lend them to friends.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Good app really fun but wish you did not have to wait for your energy to come back you should get it!!
B004XISI4A|4.0|I think this was the most enjoyable of the series so far, except possibly book one. This was certainly a tremendous relief following the travesty of book 4, which was more like 80s TV classic &#34;Dallas&#34;.<br />This saga is finally back on track and I'm looking forward to book 6.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Keeping an old man up on the eye hand coordination. Have broken 1,000 three times with a high of 1113.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is an awesome game but I got one problem.Atom and Zeus&quot;s ripoff. There the 2 main characters in the movie so you would think that both have cool ripoff. Wrong! They probably have the dumbest ripoff I've seen Zeus just punches the robot in the chest 2 or 3 times in the chest and then just smashes his head off and Atom punches the robot  and then uppercuts his head off. Some people might think that's cool but I don't that's the only problem (besides no byor) I have with the game other then that I would totally recommend getting it.
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|This game is for my great granddaughter, (10), she loves it and stays with it for quite a while. Glad to have it in the carousel.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|My review<br />I chose 4 because I like the movie and the book<br />I decided to read this book because it's fun and a good book to read.
0399226907|2.0|This is A good  classic educational book for the teaching the days of the week to a three year old.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love playing minecraft on the pc/xbox and PE was the very first version of mc i've ever played. If you don't have the money for the pc or xbox version, this is a great  tool to learn the basics of mc. It has a few blocks and a<br />flower type that are different from the pc and xbox, but it does have the basics of mc and you can play without wifi. Also it's growing more like the pc version every update.  Truly worth $7.00
B00BXLU1EU|1.0|it doesn't realy hack wifi. its only good for pranking your friends. I know it doesn't work because I went on to a secured wifi that I already new the code to then I used this and the password wasn't right. there are no apps that hack wifi.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Very worthwhile doc. Hard to describe without ruining the plot, but definitely a worthwhile view--and an amazing story. ok enjoy
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|because I love dragons<br />and I love taking care of dragons playing games with dragons I just love dragon vale
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|well, the energy is annoying and the load times are long. but I like the game. the holiday missions are super easy and do not require the 40,000 dollar shotgun in recommends. pretty fun game. I like how many different modes there are. crashed my kindle fire once but they may just be my device acting up.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best on-the-go game ever! I have 0.7.6 and I'm waiting for 0.8.0 it'll have Enderman and minecarts, and ... Redstone!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I don't like all the time you have to wait between lives if you run out.  I refuse to purchase them.  I think the game is fun though.
B004U7JYXS|5.0|no problem w/ loading film, less expensive that similar polariod film and camera, pictures are the size of a standard business card...many fun ideas to for using pictures
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This was a fabulous price for the movie! Fantastic musical and I couldn't be more thrilled that amazon offered it at such a great price. :)
0062068423|4.0|It was definitely enjoyable and explains some other issues that I have found in having read this out of sequence.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so much it is a amazing I got the girl I love the game it is so fun
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Another novel that will stay with you.  The pictures de Rosnay paints of what happened to this one Jewish family in Paris during WWII will haunt you.  The style in which the book is written makes it easier to digest.  Chapters alternate between the story of the past as it unfolds and the journalist in the present who is learning the story as she writes.  It is a sad story but it is based on something terrible that did happen and people should be made aware of it, if only to prevent it from ever happening again.  I read with a book club and there was plenty to discuss at our gathering.  I recommend it.  There was a film version of it as well and it was surprisingly well done and true to the book.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|They just seem to get it right...their games are extremely playable and will allow you to progress without having to be constantly hit by micro transactions
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Who doesn't love Downton Abbey?  It is a magnificent mini series with period costumes and historical reference.  The acting is superb. It will not disappoint.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Bart Bonte makes awesome games!!!  (I don't know him -- I just like his games!)<br /><br />The game play on this game is very smooth.  You have a plain white ball, you have some tools for decorating it, and you have a picture of how the ball should look when you finish decorating it.  You need to figure out the tools and use logic to make the ball match the picture.  It starts out easy but gets progressively more difficult as the game goes on.<br /><br />I think I did this entire game in one sitting.  It was too interesting to interrupt!  Then I started over and did it all again two or three times.  Then finally I was done -- it's not so replayable after three or four times through everything.<br /><br />My one wish is that I'd like the game to be able to generate random ball decorations for me to puzzle out, so that I could continue playing for longer.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Very interesting journey into what Germany was like to the average German during Hitler's rule. Recommended book for anyone interested in how war effects the average person.
B007EC27QM|5.0|This is great for the basic calculations I use this app for.  Well worth the&nbsp;price.  Would recommend this to others especially while shopping for quick calculations.
B00GX59QO2|2.0|It relied way too much on viewers having seen the first one...it was flimsy with no character development, bereft of the chemistry and sharp humor of the first Red. Mary-Louise Parker acted as if she was sleep-walking through the entire movie; even the villain was one-dimensional. Anthony Hopkins was annoying as a befuddled menace; love, love Helen Mirren but she was under-utilized; Bruce Willis, another one of my faves, looked confused throughout; the only saving grace being John Malkovich, who was hytserically funny but his role couldn't support the whole film. BIG disappointment!
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|This is one of those books that I couldn't read all at once, preferring to ration myself the humor to make it last.  Thanks, Allie!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I haven't finished the book but it's written in an interesting way- narrated by the angel of death- and is so descriptive you feel very involved in every scene.  And having knowledge of the happenings of the 1940s you can't stop worrying about Hans and Leisl.  I only read at night and can't wait for night to come each day.
0060574216|1.0|I ordered this book and sought out this particular book bc it was shown as the 2012 edition. 1st, it took ab  1 1/2 weeks to ship which is ridiculous without tracking. I emailed for tracking info the nxt day, they sent it.  Finally got the book and it's the 1991 edition! I emailed them very upset bc I would've gotten that copy at my local library for free and not paid them and waited for them to slowly ship the book! They never responded bck to I would NOT RECOMMEND buying from this amazon store EVER! I should have read the other reviews before making a purchase.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great addictive game.  I was skeptical of this game but have come to love it and cannot wait to play everyday.  The levels get harder and harder but you can keep trying and even go back to get a better score.  Fun.  Recommended.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|visually appealing to small children, but very difficult for my 5 year old to navigate.  It would be nice if this game had different levels to choose from. Just to fast.
1408853914|5.0|A definite MUST read! I'm almost finished with it, and it SOAT has by far exceeded my expectations! No matter if you loved or hated Eat Pray Love (which I loved!) SOAT is a completely different writing approach.
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|Pretty game.  Enjoyable to play.  No replay value.  Once you're done, that's it.  But a nice way to spend 2-3 hours.
B000T433CO|5.0|One of the best holiday movies ever! I watch this movie every year and am excited to have it now on Blu-Ray.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|The game is great but when I got on today and it said it needed a update so I hit ok and it brought me too the Appstore and where it should say update it just said open please help I do not know why
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|I favor movies that are based on true stories. Since the father and mother and their three sons were, in fact, reunited,  this encourages me to believe that the miraculous really does happen.
0988262592|5.0|Great book that gives wonderful insight into Dev/Ops.  I would recommend this to anyone who is new to the field and wants to get some insight into software launches.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|We love Leonard Cohen's music and enjoyed his pleasant style, as well as all his backup people, musicians and singers alike
B0055SWM08|1.0|This game is awesome but until this game saves my perfect scores it is a waste of time,<br />fix this is
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|I'll preface this by saying that many of my friends absolutely loved it.  I thought it was an okay read; however, I found it quite schmaltzy.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It works beautifully. Setup is extremely easy. I didn't give 5 stars because many applications are not available for chrome-casting.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have been very impressed with this app.  It gives a lot more information than I had originally anticipated. I would recommend it to anyone.
B003G4W49C|5.0|5 Stars because it rocked. It was as emotionally engaging as I remembered from reading it as a teenager, but Speaker For the Dead is even better. I guess that means this shouldn't be 5 stars, but I choose to believe that this should be rated 5 stars and Speaker For the Dead should be 6. Mr. Card can WRITE.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|I am a fan of music and I love the story line of this movie.I do believe music does have a way of connecting people.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I know that the movie is scheduled to open soon...the TV ads made me seek out this book to read.<br />WOW!! WHAT A BOOK!  I was on the edge of my seat for days, until I could finish this beautiful book.  I was a bit skeptical about the<br />supernatural aspect of the narrator...I was so moved by this story.  I have read many books about the holocaust...my Dad was a Holocaust Survivor.  This book touched me deeply.  I never thought I could have sympathy for the German people during that time...but this book opened my eyes to the harsh realities of war and it's unending ability to destroy innocent lives on BOTH sides of any conflict.  READ THIS BOOK!  YOU WON'T BE SORRY!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|At first I didn't know how to set the mouse to my liking and I didn't like it. But then I did a little research and figured out I had to go to the website to download the instillation software. After that the mouse was really good and worked perfectly. This is a very good mouse and would recommend it to anyone
0385537131|5.0|As always, Grisham is interesting, informative, and fast reading.<br />The story appears to be something that could actually happen in the real world.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Love love love this show, it's the reason we extended past our free trial period with amazon!!! It is full of suspense, my husband and I love it!
B0012DP8A6|5.0|Love this classic musical! Offbeat, dark humor, great music, and wonderful performances make this a real treat! A must have for your movie musical collection.
B00E5N8E2O|5.0|It is a wonderful addition to our collection & very much enjoyed by the whole family!  It was in great contdition.
1480569372|5.0|Brandon you have done it again! Awesome new series, can't wait for book 2!<br /><br />The book is about what happens if ordinary humans are suddenly given extraordinary powers. The book is fast paced, I could not put it down. There were some great twists, especially at the end.<br /><br />I started reading the author's work through the Wheel of Time series, and I am glad I switched to his other novels afterwards.
0552560359|5.0|This is an amazing book! I am a speech therapist and I have used it with children ages 2 to 12. It is wonderful for building knowledge of vocabulary (e.g. igloo), describing words (e.g. long limousine), occupations (e.g. acrobat), and categories (e.g. pets). Children love interactive books, and it's fun to take turns telling the child what you would like and then they get to pick what they like.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So easy to use and set up.  Wish I would have got this awhile ago.  Save your money, get this and stop buying dvds.
B001P06GX4|5.0|My husband and I and his parents love to play this strategy game where you try to fit in as many pieces as you can while only letting the corners touch. My husband is great with spatial orientation, but thankfully this game has a little bit of luck to it too! You have to have four people to play this game, but if you look on amazon there is a two-person version of the game, as well.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|Nice interesting story.  Good acting.  M. Mac Conaughy played a different role this time.  The two boys steal the movie.
B00G3P6VA4|1.0|Why is it necessary to shove a message down my throat?  Forget for a moment that the message is absurd, why does an industry that struggles to make a decent movie feel obligated to preach to me.  So avoid this mess, unless:<br /><br />  - you are a communist<br />  - you are filthy rich and feel the need to suffer for being so rich<br />  - you think Mat Damon is qualified to lecture anyone<br />  - you hate America (and mankind in general)<br />  - you wish to support Hollywood's propaganda machine<br />  - you are clueless<br /><br />It seems longer, but it is about 100 minutes you will never get back.
B009HEN9DU|3.0|It has good visual effects but lacks a good, thoughtful plot. I concur with the review that said it is a tween movie. That about sums it up.
B00GX59QO2|1.0|Red 2 had some funny parts.  However, if also drags on in some spots.  It just seems like it is pushing to make the gags work.
B00FIYGYKS|5.0|Fantastic change of pace for Trivium. I loved their previous works, even a few songs on The Crusade, but I like this direction just as well. Even if they return to their old style in later albums or stick with this new one I'll still listen to them.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The collection is beautifully designed.  The first and third films in the series is why you want it.  It makes a great gift for someone else or for yourself.
B00EOO55GW|2.0|Not what I wanted from Avenged, but I wish them the best. I loved their self-titled album and Waking the Fallen. Nightmare had many of the elements I loved from them, and some I didn't. I'll listen to this album from time to time to see if my tastes have changed, and so far I have found a song I can enjoy (Requiem), but the album as a whole disappointed me a little. The musicianship is fantastic as always, but I just don't enjoy this style.
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|One of those movies you need to watch again. Easy to miss some of the nuances of the movie. I liked it!
B00E6X4GAW|5.0|Even as an adult I leant the importance of never giving up! And I do hope her dream will come true on day and wish her luck and Gods blessings to keep moving forward. This book should be read by girls and boys in my county Sri Lanka and know how lucky they're to be given free education from elementary to university. Everything she didn't have and wanted as a student our country provides and feel extremely lucky!<br />Education as Malala emphasises is a right for every child through out it's life and should be given free at least for the once who cannot afford it!
B002XXLKHY|5.0|Hilarious movie! As usual, Will Farrow is very entertaining and funny. Good way to start out the Christmas season. It will not dissappoint.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|As good as my expected. Price is good. big and strong enought. I like it very much. very good. Buy.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Great one- after the half way point I could barely put it down. I am still on the fence about the ending, but am not about to spoil it for those who haven't read it!!<br />Awesome read and very gripping.
0393037010|5.0|This is a sweet book. It's got so much good stuff packed in there. Naval battles, ships just blasting the hell out of each other and doing some swift maneuvres. It's got two good pals doing some adventures together and sometimes getting into a bit of trouble. Its got Aubrey cuckolding his boss, which is pretty awesome. Sometimes Maturin gets a little bit emo and freaks out, but its a cool book. They killed a guy for raping a goat, which is the type of stuff I can always get behind.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|I purchased this simply for The Day of the Doctor episode. It was fantastic.  The other episodes included were a nice bonus as well.
B000XPU5NY|5.0|The music on this cd is completely awesome.  The live performances are every bit as clear as studio recordings.  The improvisation on &#34;Home by the sea&#34; is phenomenal! A definite A+ rating from me.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|The book went by in a flash! I have already downloaded book 2 so I do not lose the momentum of the story.
B000N3ST3Y|5.0|Excellent variety of Genesis music. Great sound too. I would definitely purchase this cd again. This is a great start to a collection of Genesis music.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Had lots of fun with this game. The shots looked very real. The landscape looked real as well. I look forward to the next game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Hey guess what the app is FREE and ITS SUPER FUN get this app and you will thank me :)))))
B000ZLJOW4|4.0|a subtle and endearing look at the existential angst of teenagers growing up. Birch and Johansen do a great job
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I truly enjoyed Neil Gaiman's The Ocean at the End of the Lane: A Novel. It's  a deliciously unsettling fairy tale for the not-faint-of-heart.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm addicted to this game and have turned others into addicts....  I just keep coming back for more.  Challenging and frustrating, but can't help myself
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Another way my Kindle is a tool for me.  Great app, functional and it works great.  The visual aspect of the screen is soothing and doesn't interfere with sleep.
1451539460|2.0|I had a suspicion before I started reading this book that I am not a Jane Austen kind of person. I have listened to other people, other women, go on and on about Jane Austen, whether the books or one of the many movies based on her work, and how romantic they are and how lovely they are and I never really got it. My understanding was that Jane Austen wrote romances about plucky young heroines and  aristocratic, possibly wealthy men, set in the countryside of England.<br />I picked up this book because it was the book choice of a book club that I considered joining. I would like to say that I went into it with an open mind, because I really tried to, but, as noted above, I had a lot of preconceptions about Austen. Northanger Abbey fulfilled all of those preconceptions. It follows the journeys of young Catherine as she visits various countryside locales and meets young ladies whom she befriends and young men whom she falls in love with.<br />I don't understand how someone can fall hopelessly in love with a man after seeing him at a party for a few minutes. Was this something that happened during Austen's time or is there some subtext that I am missing? I found Catherine to be quite naive, in a way that made it difficult to identify with her as the main character.<br />The only thing I found enjoyable about this book was the slight fun Austen seemed to be poking at Gothic style literature by having Catherine suspect one of her hosts of murdering his wife because of circumstances which mirror the novels she enjoys reading.
B003VANOFY|2.0|Headphone sheds the ear pieces and flaks off. Decent sound quality and range. Microphone after 2 years cannot unmute itself and just makes a static sound when flipping it up and down.
B00G32OER4|5.0|Very good movie.  Awesome that it was based on a true story.  Makes it even more scary!  Will watch again.
3836501899|5.0|Fantastic illustrations of what is still possible with polaroid film.  I'm &#34;new&#34; to the genre and having a great time.  May it last another thousand years!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  So hilarious and I love the music in the movie, makes you want to sing along.  Fat Amy is hilarious!
0152023984|5.0|Classic book for the generations.  Gift for first grandson.  Saint Exupery knew how to weave a story.  Have loved for years.
1593975457|5.0|I love everything James Herriot. Having Christopher Timothy read it was a brilliant move. Being familiar with him as James Herriot from the series, it just sounded right.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Great book, easy ready, enjoyed.  Unique book with well developed characters.  Love all of Donna Tartt books.  She is a natural story teller.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I've seen a lot of versions of Les Mis, but have to say this is one of the best. Besides the Dreamcast version, one doesn't need to look any farther to enjoy Victor Hugo's story.
B008OTTRXU|5.0|One of the all time best dance and feel good cd's I have ever bought!  Enjoyed Carly more then all the other CD's I have bought of all the current stars that you get tired of hearing about!  Wish more people could discover this music.  Call Me Maybe is the reason I purchased it but the entire cd is just as great!
B00DCX08MW|5.0|I went through the whole campaign, lots of fun. Killed my battery because I couldn't put the game down. enjoyed the graphics. Worked great on my RAZR M. I did find one glitch at the end. I was able to make it back to airbase. I guess the app was waiting for a water landing.
B001UFQNF0|4.0|My son was super excited to receive the Delorean the only issue we had with it was that it was a model from back to the future part 1 not the model shown in the pic which is the one from the second movie
B0000640RX|5.0|I Like Sylvester Stallone Movies And This Trilogy Was Very Enjoyable To Watch.These Are Movies That I Can Watch Many Times And I Can Enjoy Them.
B003QSLW0K|1.0|Had I checked netflix I could have watched it for free . The movie was bad the kid is a brat didn't want my 3 year to pick that up.
0802473156|5.0|Very helpful; easy to read and understand.  I would recommended it for certain.  I hope my wife will read it.
006441034X|5.0|I wish the movie were half as good as this book. It's an amazing story, one that I've come to read in a yearly basis. If you want a book that you can read and read again. Think about this one.
B000002LSV|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband.  He is an avid ZZTop fan and he loved the CD.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Nicely written biography about a true genius of our time. Would highly recommend as a read. Very long but well worth the time.
B00GH4RKYM|2.0|After seeing the trailer I was excited about watching this movie.  However, the movie did not deliver what I expected. The fight scenes were overdone and tiresome.  Frankly, I became  bored.  But my biggest gripe was that Superman, at the end of the movie, kills his enemy.  To me that was an unforgiveable change from the comic book hero, who always said that he would hang up his cape if / when he ever killed anyone.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Just downloaded the new sections, added more fun!!  I am still not an expert by any means, but it's still fun!!
B00511ONPG|5.0|I'm a social media dork.  I needed a book that would tell me where to begin AND explain where each step of the process - be it right or wrong - would take me.  Excellent job, Dave.  Thank you!
B0019LZV4E|5.0|excellent cast music drama and effects amazing :)excellent would watch it again:) powerful movie should make more like it .
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Love being able to read all my news feeds in one place.  When I'm short on time, the ability to scan just the headlines and pull what I need is perfect!
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I chose five stars because it tells the exact definition of the word . I also tells if the word are Latin
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I was anal about reading this final book, because  I never wanted the series to end. After getting into the book, I realized how in depth it really was, and how everyone played such a huge part in the book. Through the torture brought on by the capital, to the reconnection of the star crossed lovers, this book had my heart racing! I get upset at the  end when Gale leaves, but knowing that Katness and Peeta are together after 20 years and have children make up for it.  Even though this series is fictional, I was thrilled to know that the Hunger Games were officially over and Katness ans Peeta's children can live in a peaceful world. Suzanne Collins,  you did a remarkable job with this series, and  I hope in the  future I can<br /> enjoy your books more!
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Was not fond of game when was on Facebook, but love the changes and quests. Enjoying this... Hope it last long.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|one of my favorite childhood books... I'd recommend it to every girl and sure would be glad if my daughter learned from it
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|I would recommend this series to anyone who likes MGS. It simple. You get all the games ever made except MGS 5 (of course) for one fee. it is a complete steal for anyone who likes this series.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Watching this for the second time was even better! I wanted to rewatch this before I went to see &#34;Catching on Fire&#34; - good choice. Caught me back up and made me excited to see Katniss kick butt again!
0061950726|5.0|I just finished &#34;Orphan Train&#34; by Christina Baker Kline. Not normally a reader of historical fiction, I felt immediately drawn to this story by the cover photo. And boy, am I glad I picked it up. It is a sweet story of childhood adversity and adult triumph that will transport you from Maine 2011 to New York 1929 to Minnesota 1929-1943 and back again. The characters are so realistic, I wanted to know them. I bet you will, too.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|great book!  so well written.  cant put it down!  The descriptions and character development is awesome! It tugs at your hear! Highly recommend this book!
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|I loved it.  Parts of it seemed over-thought and over-cautious (like he went through one or two too many rewrites) or I would have given it five stars.  But overall I really enjoyed it.  It was funny and intelligent and warm and interesting, and I would highly recommend it.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|Pros: Nice graphics and easy to play on a tablet. Cons: The graphics are too small if played on the cell phone.
B000SW2F6M|5.0|Orlando Bloom plays a very good hero in this movie.  He makes his character very real.  At times hard and unbending and at times vulnerable.  Although the story line is historical, a great deal of &#34;license&#34; was taken by the writers.  Still, it makes a great flick.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|Well I upgrade my weapons and allies but they don't get any stronger.<br />I can even beat people stronger than me they do the same thing with there character when I get close to them they walk in front of me if he/she is almost dead they back up as far as they can and when they get<br />..wall they pretend they are e still walking
B0045HCJRG|5.0|This is one of our favorite movies! Funny, and something the whole family can watch. We re watch it several times a year!
0307593525|5.0|This is a classic, as everyone knows, and enjoyable to read on it's own. It demystifies French cooking and makes it all seem possible.
B000GOU4M4|5.0|As good or better than the original which was an all time great. Would watch again for sure.  Now, where is the Tylenol!
B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|Considering Eggers' reputation, I was amazed to find this novel to be so heavy-handed and obvious. I'll quickly provide an example that is not a plot spoiler. The Circle is an amazing company, a sort of Google on steroids, full of mind-blowing technology and brilliant employees. They introduce a video camera that has all sorts of capabilities: hi-def, ability to receive the video and control the camera from a computer, etc. Most impressively, it is the size of a lollipop and costs less than $60. One could buy several of these--thousands if you have money or are a company--disguise them, and place them anywhere. When the product is unveiled to the employees of the Circle, the employees love it! Not one of these brilliant, independent thinkers stops to think of the privacy implications or the opportunities to use the product for crimes. A pedophile, for instance, could buy some of these lollipop cameras and install them anywhere children are likely to be. It is this kind of lemming behavior that happens repeatedly in the novel. None of the employees seems capable of asking even the most basic question. Preposterous. Eggers could have made his points about technology in a short essay, but instead wrote a long, awful novel.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|It is a great book, however, I must agree with many of the critics; Seal Team members should never talk about what they did and where they have been.  Team members who need to have a pat-on-the-back are usually phased out at BUD.  They are the best at being invisible and unpredictable. God Bless our Seals!!!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I enjoyed reading the book. It was well written and easy to follow if you are someone with lots of interruptions.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|As much as I like the classics, I think this was the best Superman movie to date. The back story of Krypton was interesting, and helped explain much of theconfusion surrounding what went on there as a prequel to Supermann on Earth. The effects were great, but did not overwhelm the story or the acting. MOST parts were played well. Hats off to the General Zod performance!
B009ZQNN90|5.0|Watched this the evening after seeing the Broadway matinee. it was a great family activity.<br /><br />Although some of the themes are &#34;adult&#34; in nature, it's a family-friendly film with good messages / takeaways
B000001GS4|5.0|Years ago, I heard about this recording when it was a vinyl LP. It was (I think) profiled on NPR. I ordered it and played it as a Christmas favorite. However, as with most of the world, I moved on to CDs and stopped playing this LP on my wonderful Linn record player (LP12) out of convenience.<br /><br />The players are great. The recording quality is first rate and the music evokes great memories for the holidays (my wife and I are fans of the Nutcracker at Lincoln Center).<br /><br />Looking for a new take on a long time favorite? Take a listen to this classic recording.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|Celine is back!  Is she EVER!!!!<br />There is not a bad track on this dynamic new album by Celine.<br />This is Ms. Dion at her BEST;<br />If you have ever liked her music, you will love this album.
B00G70JQZC|5.0|Great movie.  Far enough out there to be cool.  Hugh Jackman gives a fantastic performance as the Wolverine with all the intensity one would expect from such a conflicted (person?).
B007EC27QM|4.0|Works for me, I don't need  or use any thing but a basic calculator. Just for quick calculations , shopping etc it does the job.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book made me think and act differently toward my new puppy - the same was true for my wife and kids after they read it. I'd strongly recommend this to anyone thinking about getting a dog or with a new puppy.  As a side note: I also had an opportunity to spend the day with GT, which is the name of the dog pictured on the front of the book.
B0027MJU00|3.0|I sped through Gone Girl and liked it,so I had high hopes for Dark Places, but it just wasn't as strong. Too many of the plot points felt like they were being stretched a little too far, and all those little weaknesses added up to a whole that didn't feel believable or compelling.
B00GINENG0|5.0|When I got this app I thought it was just a normal talking Tom app. But it's not it's a very cool app u can go thrue a baby to an adult and also it's very appropriate for little kids. In this game u can feed Tom, he can go to the bathroom,u can groom him, u can play games with him, and he can take a nap and u get coins to get more food and furniture and u can change his fur color and eye color like i said this game is awesome and appropriate for little kids.
B005MSD6QU|5.0|I love the whole series.  Sometimes they are a little out there but for the most part they keep my attention throughout.  The interactions between the characters and their reliant/self-reliant conflicts make them very human and watchable.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Its a good alarm tells me all I need to Know and waking to music is much nicer than bells and whistles
B0063IH60K|4.0|An ad before EVERY game. I understand that it`s free game and the ads keep it free. But do we really need an ad before every game?
0670024856|1.0|Most tedious, boring, senseless book I have read in a long time.  Only reason I finished it was to see if it had some redeeming quality.  It didn't!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I thought this was another great Cruise movie given the plot, music and CG. Everyone else enjoyed the movie as well.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I couldn't put this down.  You know it's a good book when you wonder about the characters long after you read the story.  It's an intimate look at a bizarre country thru the eyes of women.  It is so brutal it hardly seems it could be true.
B005PW3OS8|5.0|Great flick.  Just like the comic book I read in the 60's.  Brought up to this century but still good.  Visual effects were stunning, the acting was great and the story was Dell Comics (DC).<br /><br />Recommend it!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|It's just plain awesome! I thought it's great but make the Sinestro boss a little less challenging cause it's way too hard for only bronze characters
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|This is a very special story, told with so much heart and from the viewpoint of a young child.  We enjoyed it tremendously!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Entertaining read, but Grisham always is, and I enjoy and appreciate his style and plotting and characterization and the legal fun.
B00846REIS|5.0|Sooooo much better than Shades of Grey books.  Erotic, fun! and author is much more skilled.  I love the stories! read them all in a weekend.  As were most readers, I was not happy with the ending of the third book! but am hoping the 4 th book comes out soon and makes up for that.  Very enjoyable series over all!
B002YVAT72|5.0|I had a little trouble uploading to I-Tunes due to Windows 8, but got useful information from customer service, and after downloading the updated software, it's working perfectly.
B000I8G5GW|5.0|I loved this move when I saw it more years ago than I care to admit.  Sir Alec is fantastic in whatever he played in from Shakespeare to Obe-Wan (sp?).  The story is based on some facts, however, as usual, much literary license was taken.  Still all-in-all, a great and timeless movie.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|It does not have many levels and I like to play the game alone.I like playing Angry Birds Season's, because it all kinds of levels.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|It is really more of a 3 1/2 than a 4.  And I must confess I have not finished the book yet.  These for me are short books, and easy to get through quickly.  But this one,...  I am having a hard time making myself finish.  The pacing is different.  And every chapter we switch which character is &#34;speaking&#34; .  But I have found that I actually miss that sometimes and about half way through a chapter I will stumble and say Tobias wouldn't do that and then realize I am reading Tris's chapter.  The written voices have no real difference to keep you aware that one is Tobias (Four) and one is Tris.  I have read books that do this before but the &#34;voices&#34; for the characters are different.  I am hoping for a surprise or a plot twist.  But I am not holding my breathe.  I am reading on an old kindle so I can only tell you I am at 65% through the book, the later kindles tell you what page you are on.  So read it to finish the trilogy, but it has not Wow'd me.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I bought this book for the same reasons everyone else did--just to know what everyone was talking about (is that a Yogi Bear-ism?). But this book is just a terrible rip-off of the Twilight series. Literally the exact same story, except with some overly talked about S&M nonsense. After I read it, someone introduced me to &#34;fan fiction,&#34; and it totally makes sense--this is just some stupid, poorly written Twilight fan fiction, and I'm going to stop talking about it now because the longer people talk about this, the more likely it is to stick around longer than it deserves.
B00GLX0Z8C|3.0|a little fluffy, with a perdictable ending movie was used to promote Jennifer Aniston and her good girl/bad girl part was most of the story
B000URWYTS|4.0|I normally don't read this genre but the Frank Lloyd Wright aspect caught my attention. I tried to like the main characters but their hypocrisy and selfishness kept getting in the way. Mamah continually attempts to justify and rationalize (ration of lies) her actions and even the ending doesn't change my opinion. However, every young couple should read this before getting married and talk about this scenario which seems to be the norm in today's world.
B007UXSPK2|3.0|It was OK.  The stunts were almost frightening and the special effects were awesome!  However, the story line somehow fell a little flat considering how many Impossible Missions there have been.  I don't know, maybe I'm too fussy an IM fan.
B00EKTCQCC|5.0|i gave it 5 stars because of what it can do with the paid version.<br />it didnt do as many things as i had hoped with the free, that was a joke<br />but it whet my appetite for what it will do when i need it.<br />pay for it if you need it, it is fantastic!
B003TSDI0E|5.0|Read the story every year since I bought it about 12 or 13 years ago. It never gets old.  Great way to learn something new. Best advent calendar ever!
B00338QENI|3.0|I didn't love this. It was an interesting way to tell a story, but when I quizzed my doctor boyfriend about the medicine in here, he said that some of it seems a little exaggerated. Not sure why this has turned into a bit of a cult classic.
B00C0IYIN0|4.0|I watched this with my 14 & 15 year old daughters. It was a fun mother daughter movie night! It came out in theaters the year I graduated from high school - I first saw it then and loved it and 25 years or so later my girls loved it too!!
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|Excellent movie for my Kindle Fire. Great quality, color and clarity on my Kindle. I would purchase more movies in future.
B007DA2FHG|5.0|Great Horse/boy/war flick.  Had all the ingredients necessary for a fantastic movie.  The boy loves the horse, the horse loves the boy, the horse is torn away from the boy and goes to war ... (don't want to spoil the rest of the movie).<br /><br />Recommend it.

B005544TRQ|4.0|no violence; fast moving, interesting plots, should have less obvious sexual scenes, leave some things to imagination, explain use of transportation
B003G4W49C|4.0|Just like 80% of the population, I heard this movie was coming out and so read the book. It was a nice, quick entertaining read, but I have a few complaints about it--mostly the ending. Seemed a little abrupt--like all the issues (Spoiler Alert) that Ender had with his bully of a brother--they just disappeared?? Even the battle scene at the end seemed a bit anticlimatic (hey this is a practice game, just kidding it's a war and it's over!). But maybe I'm picky.
0446310786|5.0|The relevancy of this book is as important today as it was when published in 1960 as the acquittal of “neighbourhood watch volunteer” Zimmerman in Florida and various other judicial aberrations over the last 50 years have adequately demonstrated.<br />Harper Lee presents an insight into the humanity, compassion and courage of small town Alabama during the depression era all of which is over shadowed by the mind numbing stupidity of racism and its ultimate lethal consequences.<br />This book is widely read in schools in the US and rightly so, albeit some states have tried to have it removed from the curriculum, from which one can draw their own conclusions.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This show is addicting.  Loved Julianne in ER.  LOVE Julianne<br />In The Good Wife there is something so understated about her.  LETS  say mysterious.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|I can't believe a director like Del Toro did this. it's a lousy story with just awful dialog. The effects are the only reason to see this turkey, but I don't think I would waste $4 just to see those. Hopefully the director will never see that big of a budget for a movie again and get back to making interesting stories told in a imaginative way. This is just Blah!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|very good book starts out slow<br />getting ready for book 2 and I do hope that it's not the end of Cristien  and ana

B00EEPFRGE|5.0|I have to say, I love Stryper, but I haven't really been bowled over by anything since &#34;Against the Law,&#34; which is kind of why I dragged my feet in buying this one (just got it today).  I just listened to it for the first time and...WOW.  I don't even really know where to start!<br /><br />One little criticism I might have about &#34;past Stryper&#34; is the piece-mealing of Michael Sweet's incredible screams...but not this time!!  He is in top form here, sounding better than ever, and just absolutely nails every song.  And the riffs...just WOW.<br /><br />If you never particularly cared about the Stryper of hair metal's heyday, you're in luck - you probably won't even recognize them.  This album is rawer, grittier, and harder than anything they've ever done.  For those uncomfortable with religion, don't let that stop you - the lyrics aren't of the &#34;fire and brimstone&#34; variety.  They get their point across, but not in a way that'd make anyone squirm.<br /><br />This album puts Stryper in a whole new league.  Who'da thunk it - these guys are around 50, yet they've managed to make the most relevant, kick-a** album of their career.  Who among their peers, as good as they may be, can say they've outdone themselves to this degree over 25 years later?  Not only that, but these guys have kept themselves in good shape and still pull the &#34;sexy rocker&#34; thing off, which certainly doesn't hurt.<br /><br />This album is a metalhead must.  You will NOT be disappointed.
B00FXEL00W|5.0|This book is a must-read.  From the alternating points of view being told in alternate chapters, to the depth of emotion and realism that makes the characters Payton and Kendall come alive, this book was a &#34;read at first sight.&#34;  Kristen Zimmer successfully tells the story of what happens when you fall in love with your best friend, along with the joys, sorrows, repercussions and obstacles that are experienced.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who has longed for the heart of another, to lovers of romance, and anyone who loves a good story.

B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I don't find it very fair that the kindles can not get the daily spin, I have to use my iPhone. But I do love the game.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy to use. Works very well.<br /><br />That is how I would sum this device up. I'm a software developer so bleeding-edge tech is not something that intimidates me. Quite the opposite actually. So I was expecting that I would need to go above and beyond to get the Chromecast working. I couldn't have been more wrong.<br /><br />You literally plug the thing in and follow the instructions. I installed the app on my Nexus 7 tablet and let it do its thing. I was even (pleasantly) surprised that it picked up my WiFi password from the tablet and provided it to the Chromecast for me. That was great as I was dreading typing in a 26-character password into *another* device.<br /><br />As for the operation, compatible apps on your tablet or phone will auto-magically find Chromecast and display the Chromecast icon (via your home WiFi network... wireless is a requirement). Touching the icon will send the content to Chromecast turning the device into a remote control. YouTube, Netflix, and Pandora all work like a charm. I've had Pandora running for hours from my Galaxy S4 to the Chromecast with no hiccups whatsoever and Netflix has worked perfect as well. It is honestly so easy my parents could handle it.<br /><br />The only disappointment right now is the lack of first-party apps and support. However, given the popularity of the thing, I've got to believe that will change. While it is true that you can cast from the Chrome browser to the Chromecast, you should know you need a plugin (free) and that it only works on the desktop version of Chrome. Copy-protected content (Silverlight-based content and some others like Hulu) won't stream over the tab casting feature. The mobile version of Chrome does not support casting tabs to the Chromecast (yet).<br /><br />This is now my go-to solution for streaming content to the TV supplanting an Mk802 android stick. Smart TVs and consoles and such are convenient but the Netflix/Hulu/etc don't get updated nearly as often on those devices (if ever). With Chromecast, I'm always running the latest version and as it grows in popularity it will only get better.ever).

B00009NHC5|5.0|I love this movie! The story is great and builds at a perfect pace. Audrey Hepburn is amazing. When people want to watch an older movie, I always bring this one up first. Would love to see a re-make of this (not that it could get any better, but it would be interesting nonetheless!)

0316069515|4.0|The title of Connelly's latest Mickey Haller novel refers primarily to the jury. Paraphrasing can't do justice to how Connelly explains it, but you'll like it.<br /><br />As it begins, we are brought up to speed on the nightmare that has become Haller's life. The failed campaign. The drunk driver case.  The estrangement from his daughter.  Add these to Haller's regular issues, and yikes! There are some Guilt Gods at work here as well, perhaps!!<br /><br />Then, Haller has a murder case dropped in his lap, and off we go.  We find out shortly that the victim played heavily in Mickey's past.  And it involves characters on both sides that Haller has had run-ins with.<br /><br />Some people think making Harry Bosch a half-brother to Haller was a bit too convenient.  Actually,  Connelly's genius in this move is to create two sides of the same coin. If you are a faithful reader of both series, you already know this. If you're new, you'll get it. Both Haller and Bosch understand the cost of doing business as they do, on all fronts.  He also gives Harry a fairly significant cameo.<br /><br />A big difference in the two series is that Haller's stories require a much heavier dose of process, usually in the form of courtroom events.  Connelly excels at creating these moments, resulting in excitement, character development and, occasionally, actual knowledge!  I'm sure there are a lot of &#34;legal thriller&#34; writers creating more complex and perhaps more accurate courtroom stuff, but Connelly has the right blend.<br /><br />Connelly shows he's not afraid to wink at himself, with an amusing reference to the hit film of The Lincoln Lawyer, and the effect of its' popularity on the way Mickey rolls.<br /><br />The case goes forward in typical Connelly style.....fast-paced and informative. And tragic, as we lose a valued character in a brutal murder.  This provides some righteous motivation to Haller and his team as they attempt to exonerate their client, who frankly, is not that great a person to begin with, but clearly innocent of this particular crime.<br /><br />Connelly sets up conflict right up there with the best. Every time Lee Lankford enters the picture, your hairs rise.  Their courtroom scene is the thematic nexus of the story, and it's also incredibly exciting.<br /><br />The Gods Of Guilt takes Mickey's story forward, creating both hope and concern for our fave lawyer's future.  It's a pretty good starting point for new readers as well, so no matter where you stand on that continuum, you need to genuflect to The Gods Of Guilt.great a person to begin with, but clearly innocent of this particular crime.<br /><br />Connelly sets up conflict right up there with the best.

B00GTZJLAK|3.0|This movie is not even comparable to Cars.  My boys seemed to like it but weren't super interested in it (ages 5&7).  The story was OK, but I just couldn't get into it too much.  Maybe I was looking forward to a deeper storyline similiar to Cars?  I'm glad I rented it and wouldn't purchase it.
0142410705|4.0|What can I say about John Green? He's really very clever. The way he connects seemingly random details always amazes me (and usually makes me laugh). I know it's unfair of me, because this book's subject was nowhere near as emotionally distressing as The Fault in Our Stars, so I should not be comparing the two, but my brain won't let me not. So, no. An Abundance of Katherines did not have the same emotional impact on me that TFIOS did, but it couldn't possibly have, so that's not really a negative.<br /><br />I loved the characters in An Abundance of Katherines. Colin and Lindsay and Hassan are some of the funniest characters I've read in a while. They are the reason An Abundance of Katherines has been described so many times as laugh out loud funny, because they are unapologetic about their sense of humor. They connected so well at their first meeting, but there is no such thing as instalove in Gutshot, Tennessee, that's for sure. Colin is no more interested in Lindsay when he first meets her than a marine biologist is in looking at a new species of fish. She's different and pretty, but he's not the kind of guy to let looks figure into romantic decisions. But, since An Abundance of Katherines is a coming of age story, Colin grows and learns and figures out somethings he'd been missing in his friendships and relationships. And the best part is that it's so relatable nearly everyone's had similar thoughts at one point or another.<br /><br />I think the biggest problem I had with the book was that I didn't connect to the characters the same way I did with Gus and Hazel in TFIOS, which is a totally unfair statement. I mean, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed reading about Colin and Hassan and Lindsey. I believe I just ranted a little about how I loved them and their problems were so relatable. But they were characters with relatable problems, not people. They weren't whole, functioning human beings that I cried and lost sleep over. Colin's existence on the page did not change me in any fundamental way, the way that Hazel's existence did. But it was still a good, solid story. Colin was entertaining and clever and did make me think about things in ways I never had before. So on a scale of 1 to TFIOS, it's not a stunning 10, but it still rates pretty high.<br /><br />I think my favorite part about the book, however, is all of the math! Crazy, right? I would just like to point out that I don't understand math on a level that is in any way, shape or form on par with Colin's understanding of math. But I did enjoy reading about his Theorem and I even enjoyed reading the Appendix, in which an actual mathematician explains the math the theorem is based on. It went straight over my head, but still. It's awesome that it exists!<br /><br />If you're looking for a great contemporary then An Abundance of Katherines won't let you down. But if you're looking for the same emotional heartbreak that was The Fault in Our Stars you might be disappointed. Just go into it knowing it's not the same and you should be alright!ge me in any fundamental way, the way that Hazel's existence did. But it was still a good, solid story.

I would NEVER consider watching this in a family setting and do not see it's appeal.  And Chevy Chase's mouth hanging open the entire time was repulsive.

I don't dive without it the only reason It is not 5 stars is because if your not proactive about clearing the filter of tiny bubbles that form it can distort your picture. Other then that great filter easy to use and good quality.
B00005R87Q|5.0|There is more than meets the eye in THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS. It is more than just a fast car action movie. It goes beyond that genre touching camaraderie and an interesting integration of multicultural back grounded characters. Paul Walker and Vin Diesel make this film work with racing fast cars at the heart of it all. There is a derivative thrill in it all, a certain attraction that lingered long after I saw this in the theater years ago.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Good but not great, rather typical zombie movie. No new ideas, nothing spectacular, but good execution of the usual fare.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|It was a very funny movie for all ages.  It contains humor for all age levels and is kid appropriate.
B00BATG18K|4.0|It was interesting, but not quite as good as some of her others.  While I'm sure sex figured prominently in the life of a courtesan, there was more of it than I thought necessary.
B009E3EY38|5.0|If you love music this is a must have, I have enjoyed this DVD&#60;CD since day one, the dvd is as good as the concert, its a warm up for the big concert
B00FN811SY|5.0|Would be an even BETTER app if it were available on a Kindle Fire and Amazon worked WITH the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society to do so.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|Perhaps not the most complex, but a solid read when you need to get away. Expect the last third of the book.to be fast paced. Will definitely read more by this author.
B005LJITS0|3.0|Watchable and that's about it for this comic book action hero.  A better villain might have helped some.  A few good scenes.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|The first two seasons of &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; were exceptionally well-received, capturing Emmy Awards and a devoted following.  Season Three ended up garnering even more acclaim, and this DVD set contains all 13 episodes of that season that originally aired on AMC in the spring of 2010.<br /><br />This season was one in which relationships between the characters became increasingly strained during the intriguing plot twists of these episodes.  Walter (Bryan Cranston) struggles to hold himself together as his marriage to Skyler (Anna Gunn) unravels and he faces struggles with his conscience and psychological fallout from his activity in the meth business and his life of deceit.<br /><br />The relationship between Walt and Jesse (Aaron Paul) takes several turns as well--the two have differences based on education and socioeconomic status, but a key sequence also brings to light the difference between Jesse's impetuous, youthful ways and Walt's more calculating, middle-aged outlook.  Season Three also continues to show the negative impact, some of which they are not even aware of, that the behavior of the two have on others.<br /><br />As in the first two seasons, the scenes of the New Mexico desert become another star in the series, and series creator Vince Gilligan provides great insight while briefly discussing each episode on one of the special features on this DVD set.  I look forward to watching the final two seasons of what some are calling one of the best television series ever.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great Character Depth.. Makes Me Feel Like IM There ObservinG .. I Have So Many FavoritEs Especially Maggie Smith's Violet.
B00FLDG5BE|5.0|Could not wait to get this Blu-ray, I am very happy with this purchase, great sound, I also purchased the CD
0871403633|5.0|One of the rare books that I put down after reading it and feel truly happy to have read. See my review at: [...]
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Wasn't sure about it. If your looking to pass the time away and are tired of BS games you should try this out. What have you got to lose? 99 cents.. Gets your mind going what could really happen.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Don't know if I can recommend it to anyone, but only because it reveals a side of myself that I've never fully shared with anyone. Refreshing to think that MY inner goddess isn't so absolutely alone in the world. A SEXY read for a woman like me, but a MUST read for any man for whom women are still from Venus!
B00457WZEI|5.0|It was great also better than the movie I saw. Where ever you are you have a great story here.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Like his dbl publish &#34;dou-ology&#34; of Europe n the mid centuries, this trilogy is shaping up as a Zukerkman calls them &#34;A BLOCKBUSTER&#34; piece of work!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|great presentation and music.  Jackman  can carry any role it seems.  Recommend  so if one wants to see it over  he can.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|To put it simply, this is a great movie, in my opinion. The concept, the execution, the delivery and everything else was amazing. I felt this movie had lots of emotional moments in it (but maybe that's just me). There is one thing I did not like much about the movie -this might be a minor Spoiler, so don't finish reading my comment if you do not want to hear it- and that is why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5; the &#34;bad guys&#34; seemed evenly matched with the good guys, and almost came out on top.
0525478817|5.0|I've never read anything by Mr. McDougal before, but this is an amazing book. John Green can only hope to aspire to the power of this book that has his name on the front. If anyone knows where to locate any more work by Mr. McDougal, it will be very helpful. I now have &#34;Don't Forget to Be McDougal&#34; tattooed several places on my body because of the impact this book had on me.
B00ATUEKY8|4.0|This novel is a fantastic portrayal of the evolution of the understanding of mental disease among women, and a markedly emotional portrayal of the female experience.
006202406X|1.0|Aside from the shocking, sad, unrealistic and completely unnecessary ending. I had a hard time reading this book. it was difficult to follow it seemed to bounce around entirely too much and I felt it really lacked a story. I'm truly disappointed because I very much enjoyed the first two books this one just dropped the ball on all levels. I won't be reading her again in the future I have no need to cry more and give my heart to characters that she's just going to kill.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I can't wait for the movie.  These books are very well written.  This is a beautiful love story - even with the sex.  Read them in order and get all three at the same time because you won't be able to wait for the arrival of the next one.
B000FC12YQ|5.0|Agatha Christie with a novel twist that I wasn't expecting. Otherwise a well crafted & thoroughly readable mystery. Loved the expected Christie characters and plot build-up.
1250038820|4.0|I bought this because I love following HONY on Facebook. I was so excited to get it in the mail that I looked through the whole book that night. I was a little disappointed by the selections contained in the book, though. It seems like everyday, HONY posts pictures of people with absolutely awe-inspiring captions on the blog; it always makes me think about how wonderful and diverse we are as a people, and how even the most normal looking person can be going through a most extra-ordinary struggle. This book, however, contained a lot more exotic-looking people in New York with insignificant, or completely absent captions. It was still worth it for the tiny gems of brilliance scattered throughout. The book is visually captivating, but I think it should've contained more of what I love about HONY -- the personal stories of the wonderful humans of New York. I still think this book would make a WONDERFUL gift and conversation piece in your home -- something to make people realize that perfect strangers are imperfectly human, and that we all are made of the same flesh and bone. But of course, I will always point people back to the HONY Facebook page where I'm moved daily by new posts.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is nothing less than addictive! Keeps me on my toes! I love it..could not imagine,anyone who likes &quot;puzzle&quot; games,not becoming completely amused  y it.
B005XTLAQQ|5.0|This was a beautiful doll for my daughters doll collection.  She is collector of dolls while a great fan of anything Twilight.
B0039OC64M|2.0|I usually like dystopian novels and the movies they inspire. This was just as blan as the book though. In real life things just don't get to go our way but in a work of fiction you expect a little artistic liberty to bring about something positive to grasp in the plot or at the very least a little understanding as to motives that drive the characters. Yet here we find only despair throughout without even a hint as to the actual motivational forces at play.  Control simply for the sake of control, where neither side actually gains form it, seems to pointless to be beleivable.  I really do get the over all point of the movie as well as the book, as a literary warning to those that give up control of their lives to the all invasive and controling state but this is just not my personal idea of a good movie.
B00G5G7K7O|5.0|I took my 9 year old cousin to watch this movie because shes been wanting to see it for a while. She saw the trailer with the snowman and just thought he was adorable. I was shocked at how amazing it was....it's one of those films that just warms my heart; haven't felt this way about a film since Avatar. Disney completely perfected this film, it was funny yet it still maintained the seriousness that was needed to melt my heart. I must say I even shed a tear which is rare but what can I say, we can all be a child at heart sometimes. This is a film to watch with the kids and good company and will surely entertain. Must watch for those 'maybe' movie goers, just go see it, you won't regret it I promise. I plan on going to see it again in 3d; when Disney has put so much effort and time in creating such a great film, I will support them all the way.
B003B02O0A|4.0|I liked the book and it kept my interest.  It was a little slow in spots and I just wanted it get moving.  It painted an interesting portrait of Southern culture.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Weird, but having both of my parents die of cancer, draws me to stories such as this one. Loved the perspective of teens. On the same note, he 4 stars comes from the fact that these are two teens you don't usually run into, so some of the things are over the top for modern day kiddos, but perfect for a Soap Opera I might add! But loved the story none the less. It was such a great combination of heart string tugging, yet barrels of laughter.
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|Quick download to my Kindle Fire HD. Looks easy and at first it is but then the fun starts. The puzzles get quite complicated, but not unsolvable, and very fast. A great time waster that I have to remind myself to quit and do some productive work. Easy to say hard to do.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|Well done and very entertaining! Really good story line. Henry Cavill is also eye candy. Russell Crowe was good. Don't know the bad guy- but he was good too.
0307279189|5.0|I received Born to Run as a gift- when my girlfriend saw that i was dabbling into barefoot running-and I absolutely loved it. The book is very well written and an incredibly easy and fast read. For anyone who's into running, this is a must. I guess that is why it is a best seller!<br /><br />The book not only caters to runners, but is a great story of a journey to the Mexican wilderness in search of running guru Micah True, also known as Caballo Blanco. This journey puts McDougall in the middle of the Leadville Ultramarathon where he finally meets Caballo Blanco and throughout a spiritual and physical journey to the Copper Canyons of Mexico with the Tarahumara tribe, whose legendary running prowess leads the author to reconsider his way of running- and living.<br /><br />The book is a great road trip journey and is also full of research, statistics and anecdotes on the science of running. At times I felt the book started to lose track of the story with these anecdotes, but at no time did the book ever get boring.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|If this case had a pocket inside the front cover, I would have given it five stars.  I like this case much better than the others I tried.  No flimsy elastic corners.  The Kindle Fire snaps snuggly into the back of the case.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I love this show. It's a great balance of drama & humor. I'm hooked on the many layers this show represents. The books, the TV show, the supposed movie.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|This was a very helpful book with understanding how to change. I highly recommend reading it. It can help in business and in your personal life.
B007THA4FI|1.0|i found the book very boring it did not hold my interest and i found myself skimming much of the time
B000JMKRKC|5.0|Twists and turns that I never saw coming!  Great read for a fiction lover getting sick of the same old.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|WHAT CAN I SAY EXCEPT WOW!! I AM A HUGE FAN OF THIS SERIES, AND HOPE IT NEVER ENDS. CHARACTERS ARE GREAT AND THE ZOMBIES LOOK SO REAL!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's enjoyable, but the directions for a beginner are very vague. I'm glad it's free. I don't spend any money on it. I'm willing to wait for more lives.
0385302320|5.0|i HAVE READ ALL HER BOOKS, AND LOVED THE VENTURES WITHIN. THIS SERIES INCLUDES HISTORY, ROMANCE AND MYSTERY, WHILE IMPROVING THE READER'S VOCABULARY AND KNOWLEDGE.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great book.  Definitely more john Grisham this time. I look forward to more of his books as long as he continues to write like this.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Awesome Read!! Helped make the movies more enjoyable and helped fill in some of the obvious gaps. A must read
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have  3 different solitare games on my kindle. This is my favorite one. I have had one frustrating problem. Twice the game has stopped loading. I have  had to remove the app &amp; 're-download it. It works well after that for quite a while. I like it so much that the trouble is worth it to me.
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE SWEEEETEST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN. I SHOWED IT AT A PRE-TEEN HALLOWEEN PARTY, AND THE KIDS WERE GLUED TO THE SCREEN. I WAS IN TEARS BY THE END. DIDNT THINK AN ANIMATED MOVIE COULD MAKE ME CRY!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|If you have a 7 month old or older like I do the chromecast is worth 10 times what they are charging. I have a 7 month old that can work the native netflix app fluently on ipad, iPhone and iPod touch. She can now navagate through ios devices so fluently she now has her own iPhone and ipad. To face time grandma whenever she or grandma want and to watch netflix and amazon prime movies. We also have apple Tvs on 2 of our tvs. I've yet to get our doughter to learn how to use the apple Tvs.<br />I own and install automation system for a living. So I'm constantly purchasing AV devices for testing and review. After installing a comcast in the living room for testing I was presently surprised my daughter tough her self to cast Netflix movies to the living room tv on her own. I have 3 more chromecasts on order. Do to the integration of native apps and simplicity of use I see these replacing all the apple Tvs in the house in the near future after google officially releases the sdk for the chromecast.<br />By the way I'm a mac freak so for me to replace an apple product with an android device is saying a lot.
B005LY4B0A|3.0|Found this game to be very difficult for my 56 yr old brain!  Grandson had to assist me to finish early levels.
1599219751|5.0|This book was written by a man who traveled with others through the &#34;wilderness&#34; to experience a life of freedom.  I met one of his companions who recommended I read this book so I could understand his own personal trek to the new life he has in the United States of America.  I met this immigrant at a family luncheon and immediately got the book.  I can't imagine the fear that traveled with the group each day of their journey.
B00CL151G4|5.0|So far (I've only seen 4 episodes), this series is quite exciting, thanks to this unexpected latest avatar of Holmes & Watson. Johnny Lee Miller, is a brilliant, charming and insufferable Sherlock (a tribute to Jeremy Brett?), and Lucy Liu, probably the most clever of all Watsons, the least shallow, combines calmness and passion in a very convincing manner. The plots are nicely tied together, it's altogether very enjoyable!
B00FOWX6NM|5.0|Looks Great on the Gold iPhone! At first it doesn't seem like it would but it is very nice and compliments the gold. Of course the only downside is that the clear plastic will scratch but it beats getting my phone scratched. The buttons are super easy to press and the silicone is durable. One thing I really liked is that there are little 'nubs' on the four corners of the case to keep the front and back of the phone/case off of whatever it is laying on. If the plastic gets too ugly just buy a new one, great product at a great price!
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|HILARIOUS!!! JENNIFER ANISTON IS FABULOUS IN HER ROLE...SO ARE THE REST OF THE MILLERS. GREAT STORY LINE. LAUGHED UNTIL I CRIED.
B003PJ6UHA|5.0|Physics is not enough to explain consciousness.  Time is not linear.  Is life even &#34;real&#34;?  Read for yourself and decide.
B00GX59QO2|2.0|Its ok but not as good as the first &#34;RED&#34;  It was a little slow ...some more words to complete this review
B0036DD4CY|5.0|Good budget graphics card. I don't do much PC gaming anymore. I mainly purchased this for watching and streaming TV. It doesn't skip at all and 1080p picture comes clear on my HDTV.
B005IQ5H7M|2.0|*NOT A BOOK REVIEW.*<br /><br />The typos are numerous and at times confusing. You see, they aren't misspellings, but rather different words whose shapes look similar to what the actual word is supposed to be.<br /><br />Let me give you an example.<br />Page 1, first paragraph: &#34;They said the year was 1932, arid that was that.&#34;<br /><br />The problem is that sometimes I will encounter a sentence I don't quite understand, and wonder if it's because my vocab is poor or if it's because of a typo.  Considering it's Vonnegut, I'm betting on the latter.<br /><br />2 stars, because not understanding the odd sentence here and there doesn't destroy your ability to comprehend the book overall, but boy does it really pull you out from the story.
0761171703|5.0|I'm giving this book to my daughter and her husband because they are professional ballet dancers and because they will be in the next edition of this book.
B004LDLCDG|3.0|One has to love Shakespeare.  I tried....but doubt if I'm ever a fan.  A class in the plays of Shakespeare should be<br />a prerequisite.
B000RLFJQ2|3.0|Definitely an action movie in the &#34;absurdist&#34; tradition.  The level of mayhem these characters leave behind is ridiculous, and I don't think the folks who made this movie, was trying to be absurd or ridiculous.  However, as a story, it holds up and is worth watching.  Once the skater is shot, you realize the movie is bananas.
B00GNL251C|1.0|the story line of this movie was boring. We finally turned it off halfway through the movie, that  was all we could stand. We loved the movie Ip Man but Not even all the crazy martial arts moves could make it good.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I loved this book and can't wait for the next. I feel so bad for little Chuck so sad poor fella
B001TKD4ZI|4.0|It's campy, but good and fun.  Light fluff for adults in a heavy world.  We will read more from this author.
B003VANOFY|2.0|I've had this headset for nearly a year now... and it will be my final Logitech product. Here is why:<br /><br />1. \\"Muting feature\\" by lifting the mic up vertically rarely works. Even though the mute indicator is lit, it is still live. This is not good considering I only mute my mic when discussing something private or because of jarring background noise.<br /><br />2. Random disconnects. I sit maybe 2-3 ft away from the receiver and it decides to sporadically disconnect. When the headset disconnects, it send a very harsh electronic sound to whomever I'm in a call with... from what I'm told its quite harsh.<br /><br />3. Logitech support: About a week after receiving the headset my base station failed, that is the docking station for the receiver. The receiver itself worked fine. I had to contact Logitech support to get it replaced and they were very harsh, even though I provided all of the necessary information and even though it was clearly a factory defect. This alone really grinds my gears regarding Logitech. Their customer support was far from friendly.<br /><br />TLDR; You get what you pay for, Logitech has rude and unhelpful customer support.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|I like Doctor Who because it is funny and interesting. I would reccomend watching it just because of the characters and the plot of the show.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|It doesn't even work on the kindle HD fire. It doesn't open I wish I could play it I think you should  fix this problem
B00GSAC1UI|3.0|The Little Drummer Boy which Pentatonix released and is all over social media is BY FAR the best track on this album. Very disappointed that the other tracks didn't compare to this song.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|multiple versions of the Bible to choose from.  Wonderful devotionals and Bible studies.  Pop up reminders.  I really love this app
B0015AARJI|5.0|works perfect.. had it for a few months now and its still working perfect ...only thing it does not come with a usb cord so if u dont have one your going to need to buy that also
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|this is the best alarm clock app I have used if you haven't alredy download this app now its free so that's cool too
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was very detailed,creative, and pulling. I felt as though I was given a window that allowed me to look inside a tragic but nail biting story. I can't wait to read the other books in this series.
B003XVYLDU|1.0|First off, in order not to offend anyone who loves this book and will rave about it at gallery openings and trendy wine book clubs, I do understand its place with readers as a literary classic.<br /><br />As an avid reader who cares more about quality writing, themes, plot, character development, etc this book was awful. Everything that can be complained about is why this book is acclaimed, but if you hate an incomplete story with no beginning or end, or just comprehensive storytelling, this book will make you wonder about the sanity and sobriety of its fans.
B002MG2ATY|5.0|I've only seen this movie from start to finish once. I've seen it in pieces a few times, and enjoy it. It is very long, but is done well enough to keep you interested. I'm sure people believe this movie is all fact, but it is a lot of fiction, but a great movie. Very well-done. I always like movies done in the past, just to see the way things were. While this was a tragic event, I'm too young, and wasn't born. But just in contrast to see how people reacted to JFK, and how people reacted with 9/11, it really made you understand it better, and how tragic it was. Great great movie!
1845023668|4.0|Thank you to the publisher and author for the review copy.<br /><br />Eilidh Lawson’s life has hit crisis point. Years of failed fertility treatments, a cheating husband and an oppressive family have pushed her to the limit. Desperate for relief, Eilidh seeks solace in the only place she’s ever felt at home – a small village in the Scottish Highlands. There, Eilidh slowly begins to mend her broken heart but soon learns she is not the only one in the village struggling to recover from a painful past.<br /><br />Well. Surprising. See I don’t really do love stories. Or stories with a spiritual twist. I have to admit that I went into this one with some doubt as to whether it would be for me. But it was absolutely wonderful.<br /><br />Eilidh’s story really touched my heart – as she struggled to create a family and was thwarted at every turn, eventually retiring to the peaceful Scottish Highlands to recover her equilibrium it was heart wrenching stuff.<br /><br />Jamie, left behind to care for his daughter alone after her mother leaves him is also struggling. Eilidh and Jamie were once friends briefly – perhaps they can help each other.<br /><br />Then you have Elizabeth, watching from beyond over her loved ones, influencing events as far as she can in order to bring happiness to those she left behind.<br /><br />All cleverly done, with beautiful prose and an emotional pace, this one had me hopeful and tearful. Its a poignant tale of love, loss and happiness sought. It may bring a tear to your eye but the overall sense at the end is one of hope.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of Love stories with a twist.<br /><br />Happy Reading Folks!
B000KIPT30|5.0|The amp is pretty good. I bought this because I'm getting sound out of my monitor and it just sounded a bit weak. I just bought a new pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50 headphones, which sounded amazing over the last pair I had. But the base wasn't quite loud enough for me when listening to EDM. This little baby is perfect for cranking the music up till my ears can't take any more! I can usually listen on setting 8 for about and hour or so before I have to turn it  back down to a reasonable level again. But it's pure enjoyment. Like others have said, when you turn the volume up to 9 or 10 the sound tends to get a bit distorted. But there's plenty of space on the dial for enjoyment.<br /><br />Other comments have mentioned the portability factor of this is not great, which is probably true. It runs on AC power that needs to an outlet. For me this isn't an issue, it sits on my desk and has enough room on the power strip for it's own plug in. I can see how this could a major issue for someone that is on the move a lot, possibly a musician type.<br /><br />Its' pretty small so it doesn't take up too much space. It's only 4\\"L x 2.25\\"H x 1.25\\"D Since i have a pretty small desk space to work with this works out perfect for me. If you're not a mixing professional audio this thing works just great in my experience. If you do studio work you probably want something a bit more expensive.<br /><br />I also had to pick up some cables from monoprice to get from my monitor to the amp. Just plan ahead cause this thing takes 1/4\\" male plugs, so you'll need a converter if you don't have one. Most headphones come with one, mine did.<br /><br />The one I received is silver in color and not white like in the picture.<br /><br />After owning this product for sometime now. I would agree with others that there is a slight hiss or feedback when you have the volume on low. It's not noticeable at normal volumes though.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is a lot of fun but must warn you, it's habit forming!! But I can never beat the winner :((
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This reading app works great even on my generic tablet. Thank you Amazon for making this available for free. I have Nook as well and I think amazon has a bit more of a selection, esp of free books that are not cheezy romance. LOL
B0015442YU|4.0|I have watched this movie a few times, and I do like it. About the only thing I would say is it seems like they added the gruesome parts, just to have some gruesome parts. They could've done without the gruesome, and it would've been a great movie still. Definitely not a reason to not watch the movie.  All in all great movie, especially if you likens silence  of the lambs, and the red Dragon movies.
B00A287PG2|5.0|Fascinating history of the top Management Consulting firm in the world today.  Always interesting and changing cast of characters with many and varied descriptions of their equally interesting activities and machinations.  I was particularly fascinated by the period of the mid-50s to early 60s as I was an employee during that time.  Many wonderful memories evoked from an extremly well written book.
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|good gothic thriller. Another good performance by Daniel Radcliffe. Good saturday night film. Very spooky and atmospheric<br />Good supporting cast..
B004G600A4|3.0|I love the movie! The DVD that they send wasn't the best condition because there are a couple of parts throughout the movie where it skips. It looks like it has a minor scratch. It's good enough quality that I won't make a stink about it, but just kind of a bummer.
B00006GO9Q|5.0|Miles Davis - In a Silent Way (1969)<br /><br />One of the most beautiful, unique recordings ever and a personal favorite of mine. Producer Teo Macero edits together various jams by Miles and his band into a work of art. Interestingly, Holger Czukay of the seminal Krautrock group Can was doing the same thing in Germany at this time with his own music - reconstructing segments in the studio to create a whole new piece of music.<br /><br />On IN A SILENT WAY, Miles is on fire, newcomer John McLaughlin adds wonderfully subtle electric guitar and the electric pianos of Chick Corea and Herbie Handcock are ethereal...I'll refrain from blabbing endlessly about the album, just know that this is a one-of-a-kind, ground-breaking recording that should not be missed. In fact, after hearing it you might find yourself ordering the 3-disk box set THE COMPLETE IN A SILENT WAY SESSIONS which contains not only additional tracks but the complete original recordings used to produce the final album.<br /><br />IN A SILENT WAY is extremely pleasant and relaxing. In fact, I play it often when I give massages (I'm a massage therapist) and it creates a light yet energetic atmosphere. I can't even express just how fantastic this music is. IN A SILENT WAY is surely one of the greatest albums ever recorded.<br /><br />rating: highly recommended
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have been an user of Roku for almost 4 years and one thing Roku lacked is a YouTube App. I got the chromecast just to watch youtube on TV. And it works really well. I have watched many movies on youtube using chromecast and it never failed.<br /><br />Unlike Roku, this does not take up any soace and its hidden behind your TV. However there aren't many apps using chromecast at this time. I would like to do web browsing and watch photos through chromecast. Hope it comes soon.<br /><br />Regarding the streaming quality - I have a DSL connection at home with speed hovering around 2.5 Mbps and chromecast has worked pretty well so far.<br /><br />I would recommend this product.
B005OT2YVA|4.0|I like the movie. I don't think it was as good as the first one, but better than the second one. I really didn't like the second one, as far as the story goes. The storyline on this one was definitely much better. The special effects were amazing, as usual, and one of my favorite. .
B00BD99JMW|1.0|A D- of an ending to a C- of a series. Very poorly organized and immature even for a target audience of 15-17 year olds
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|One of the better games to play. A ton of graphics and lots of color. Game is easy to play.
B004LUS390|4.0|Love the app, especially since it was a FAOTD, but I wanted basic, and it definitely isn't. Great if you want to do alot, and a big learning curve if you want to doodle.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This is one of the most awesome matching games in the world.  The 8 bit music, the graphics, the fun!!!!!  I really like that you not only have to match the items based on what is going on at the top of the screen, but also that you actually level your hero.....This game was a joy to play and I couldn't put it down.
B003DWC6LI|5.0|This book really entertains it is witty, current and takes Bridgitte from a 30 something to a mature yet crazy 50 year ols. Well Done!
1416955070|2.0|I actually started this series with the ‘Infernal Devices’, which was MUCH better.  The first three books are OK, but 4 and 5 were not of the same level.  A lot of ‘reflecting back’.  Way too much of the ‘how she felt about kissing him’, every single time.  It got boring to the point where I skipped pages throughout the story.  This 5 book series could easily have been a much better trilogy.  And I don’t like open endings when there are 5 books to read.  I should have stopped after ‘The Infernal Devices’.
0553801473|4.0|Martin did an excellent job of advancing his plot(s).  He chose to focus on each character/storyline consecutively, instead of advancing each thread more or less simultaneously as is often done.  I admit, it doesn't really work as well as the simultaneous method, but I've often wondered how his method would work, so I don't hold it against him.
B006JOW69O|5.0|This CD was very well produced. The overall balance between the vocals and acoustic instruments of the recording renders a very pleasant listening experience.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I know in life things are complicated and don't always turn out like we'd wish, but every now and then, when reading a series I have grown to love, I'd really like it to have a happy  ending. I understand but am disappointed in the ending.
0061969664|3.0|Decent enough but in some ways, a tired formula. It appears Mr. Cornwell is intent on milking this story for all its worth. I liked the first few in the series but this last one left me disappointed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book - for teens on up!  Exciting next book in the series. If you liked the first book, you're sure to like this one as well.

B001H9JBW6|5.0|Benedict Cumberbatch shines in this performance.  This was what I watched after I saw him in Sherlock.  I was blown away by the acting by all of the performers, but with this it reminded me that what was happening in this series could very well be the future.  I really enjoyed the whole thing.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes to see passion, mystery, and espionage.  While the themes speak volumes, it is still very entertaining.
B00DF0POXA|4.0|I was very skeptical of this album at first but I read some initial reviews, and decided for $1.99 I'd give it a shot. I think YEEZUS is a great title, because thats exactly what I said after listening to it though... YEEZUS!!!!! This album isn't for traditional fans of Gold Digger and Stronger, but an Alternative Rap album its a Classic! Kanye really kinda scared me on his SNL Performance, but listening to the album it is AWESOME!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham is my favorite author and I have purchased all of his books.  This is one of his best.
B00BIPCY14|5.0|Every episode keeps you on the edge of your seat. Great show! We pulled an all night marathon watching them.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|After reading this book, I am even more amazed at this young woman.  She has observed and been a part of things that would have given me some kind of post traumatic stress syndrome...and yet she is refreshingly normal.  She is a miracle!

B005WLQQ4Q|5.0|This rating is from my daughter; personally, after a parent has heard the<br />same song(s) over and over, it is less  'love' and more trying to tolerate.
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|It is not as funny as the first two. I think the first one is the funniest and then it went downhill with this one being the worse. Actually number three should be put into different genre alltogether.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Got this to try. I have a TV in the bedroom with a spare HDMI input and figured for $35 bucks what do I have to loose. I bought it on impulse and didn't do a lot of research. I figured it would work mostly like the roku with fewer available apps and controlled via smartphone/tablet. One of the things that looked really cool in the ad was the guy browsing the internet, and then \\"flicking\\" the browser page from a table onto the TV. That looked cool, and would allow me to surf in bed without reading glasses for my tablet!<br /><br />It does not do that...on an android tablet. You can do it from a laptop, or a WIN 8 tablet, maybe even from an iPad, but the android chrome browser does not have chromecast support. So all you can really do is Netflix, Hulu plus, and Youtube, HBOgo and Pandora and of course buy stuff from the Google Play Store. It is almost unbelievable that the android support is so poor. There are a few other beta apps, but not a lot. No easy way to stream other content directly off your device or computer (yea there are some workarounds). Android browser support is coming...someday.<br /><br />I'll keep playing with it. Maybe Google will update it some day to be more useful.<br /><br />Pro: Youtube (still not available on Roku)<br /><br />Cons: Does not do what it says. No real advantage over Roku (other than Youtube). No remote, Not very many apps/channels.<br /><br />Edit: I carefully re-watched the video's and they technically never say or show web browsing from an android device, but I still feel like it is almost inconceivable that they do not have this working. Chromecast didn't come out yesterday. There are some third party solutions, so it's technically possible.
B007H9B8FS|5.0|This is by far Garbage's best album yet!  I absolute love this Garbage.  They are better than most bands out there and I have to say this is one of my favorite cd's in my large music collection.  I have always been a big fan, but this new album blows away their other albums with their different pop sounds, and catchy lyrics.  I use this cd to push my new system to it's limits and the neighbors know when I am listening to Garbage!
B006GWO5NE|4.0|It did not work for my original kindle, but it has come in handy for other devices.  Cord is a little shorter than I expected.
B00C0ALZ0W|4.0|1. A lot of practice are already adopted by me, but never shared with others yet, now I see the exact same practice from people who've been doing this for decades long! That made me feel more comfortable and confidence.<br />2. It's really easy to read, we'll written book! Even for a none native English reader as me. Any people from Japan or China should feel comfortable on reading this book!
B00GX59QO2|5.0|Awesome movie. Just as interesting as the original movie Red. Definitely worth buying this film. Wish there were more to look forward to.
B00EQRPFGC|5.0|I listen to this song everyday. I will play this at my wedding. It is so pretty and meaningful. Great!!!
B00BXI0IHS|5.0|What a lovely story about an amazing time in our history about an awesome, brilliant & inspiring woman. Beautifully written. Can't wait for the next book.
0307719227|5.0|This is a wide ranging review of global political and economic events since the Black Death.  At the core, it makes the simple point that societies where open economic and political/legal institutions allow and encourage decentralized innovation have been able to take advantage of the creative destruction created by the industrial revolution and the on-going stream of economic/technological innovation that followed.  Societies which were ruled by entrenched elites who resisted innovation for fear of losing their political power and economic advantages, failed to ride the global wave of innovation, and consequently fell behind.<br /><br />There is a subsidiary issue that the authors don't resolve--successful nations need a strong legal system to enforce property rights, and thus encourage entrepreneurial risk-taking and investment.  However, strong central governments tend to amass more and more power, and exert increasing control over the private sector, where innovation and creative destruction originate.  If even democratically elected governments with inclusive political institutions can be captured by entrenched interests who stand to lose by trade and innovation (labor unions, public schools, sugar beet growers, the ethanol lobby, etc.) the benefits of creative destruction can be sharply reduced.
159420229X|5.0|This book IS a delight!<br /><br />I'd buy it again.<br /><br />The stuff he shares is entertaining, enjoyable, valuable and keeps the reader involved.<br /><br />Re-Edit: I UNDERRated this book on the first try.<br />The author is a VERY First-Rate REPORTER of everything he learned and everything that happened to him during his year from \\"getting hooked\\" on memory stuff to the U.S. Memory Championships. He covers a LOT of stuff the HowTo books don't.  This work is not difficult to get HowTo's from and fills in a LOT of blanks.<br />It is a splendid foundation for a group of HowTos.<br /><br />I'm Fussy.  My poor hearing and poor eyesight means I don't get to use eyesight to supplement hearing.  I use memory.<br /><br />Foers' book fills in a LOT of blanks.<br />It holds up well when re-read and re-read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|GREAT APP FOR WAITING IN DOCTOR'S OFFICE OR JUST TO HAVE SOMETHING TO DO FOR THE MOMENT. SOME LEVELS SEEM HARDER THAN OTHERS BUT STILL FUN APP.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works super fast from my phone, netflix, hbo go and youtube are quickly cast to the tv at the touch of a button. A bit more cumbersome from the Chrome browser on my laptop but still works well for netflix and youtube and websites (like having a giant monitor). Tried to stream local media through the Chrome browser, my laptop has issues with broadcasting 720p video but music and photos are fine (this is likely due to inadequate graphics card and cpu/ram). Can't wait until Chromecast is integrated into more online streaming apps/sites like TWCTV etc.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|This book is to cute I'm glad I found it I been looking for it for a while my mother use to read this to me as a child even better in digital download
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This detailed account of where  a lot of your  food comes  from is  an eye opener to thinking about safer, healthier, more humane and natural ways of feeding yourself, and also depicts some really horrible disgusting facts about mass produced food.
B005IGVYUG|5.0|Best Tom ever. Chicago is my favorite song on this CD. I've been a fan of his for almost 30 years.<br />His son is the drummer on this album.
B007SGM084|4.0|I loved all 3!! I was so upset when I came to the end. I fell in love with Christian and Ana. Beautiful story. 5 stars most definitely.
B00FATEJYE|4.0|Injustice just a greatly made game. It is similar to street fighter. Both mobile and console version are good. Only gripe with this game is that their is a lag when you switch characters
B00181JGI2|3.0|I feel strangely &#34;un-hip&#34; after watching this movie.  It seems to be a cult classic of sorts and was strongly recommended by a friend.  But, I have to say...it didn't do anything for me.
078689136X|3.0|Ok book.  It is a line extension to the TV series.  Not a bad book but not very great either.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This novel is epic. A little on the lengthy side, but it doesn't mean I loved it any less. Sanderson does a masterful job of weaving together a multitude of intertwined story lines. Can't wait for the next installment.
B008220C38|5.0|This was one of the best films of the year - the BRILLIANT set, the lavish costumes and the stylish performances.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's fun to play it is funnier with 0.8.0 because there is minecarts and rail road tracks best game every!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|Tactical Stealth Espionage. I've been a huge fan of Metal Gear Solid since I picked up the first Metal Gear Solid for PlayStation 1. I had no idea what I was doing at first, and I was terrible. Once I sat down and played it I was hooked. Release after release I've been on the edge of my seat, and once I found out Konami was releasing a Legacy Collection for Metal Gear Solid I immediately placed an order.<br /><br />If you want a solid collection, with an amazing story line, great cut-scenes, and awesome game play then delve into Metal Gear Solid.
B009A882D0|5.0|I love the group,  always have and I guess I always will.  it is just so nice to have the collection in one case instead of trying to find  the ones I want to hear and wondering who has the disc.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|More fun than a video arcade. Hurry up Second Life and catch up with the current technology. Can't wait for the movie.
B0065NAKRO|5.0|Love this dominoes Games. Lots of fun. Like the different ways to play dominoes. Would recommend this game to anyone
B00F2362IE|1.0|does not work 80% of the time...gives a spinning circle all the time. My 4 year old is very disappointed everytime he goes to play this game.
B00BEF1AEK|4.0|I love the graphics of this app, they are unique in many different ways! I also love the music of this app, it reminds me of a sailing ship. But, I rated it four stars because, this is not a game that I would play all day, it is interesting but it did not grab my full attention. Anyways, you are basically throwing a boulder or rock at a military tank. You only have a certain amount of boulders (or rocks) each level.  If you are a big fan of Angry Birds you will probably enjoy this app!
B00GLMQWFI|2.0|The quality of the movie was poor. It continued to pause and distort the sound and picture throughout the entire movie even when my internet connection was good and it had buffered
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|At long last Kindle fire got candy crush and looks like amazon did it right thank you very much, good job
B0026QC0TA|5.0|I love John Grisham novels and always enjoy watching his characters come to life, even though I have read the book before and seen the movie several times before.
B003GQM52Q|5.0|I would rate Amazon's stream excellent ...  5 stars.  No constant reloads, like Netflix.<br />Great quality and stability keeps me coming back!<br />Good movie, too!
B00EMAGCJM|4.0|A few of the songs are great, but others, unfortunately i cannot say the same thing about.<br /><br />My 2 favorite songs on the album are &#34;Do My Thang&#34; & &#34;Someone Else&#34;. If you do not want to commit to a full album purchase, then just download these two... the highlights on the album.<br /><br />I LOVED &#34;We Can't Stop&#34; but i kind of got sick of it, and don't really play it anymore. &#34;Drive&#34; & &#34;Adore You&#34; are a couple other good songs, not my favorites... but solid.<br /><br />The WORST song on this album is &#34;4X4&#34;. It's like western-y banjo picking rap and it is complete garbage.<br /><br />&#34;Wrecking Ball&#34; is very popular with a lot of people, but it is not my favorite, i don't really listen to it.<br /><br />Again, if you want the 2 best songs off of the album then listen to &#34;Do My Thang&#34; & &#34;Someone Else&#34;.
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|It has cute graphics, with adorable levels. I got this game for &quot;free app of the day&quot;.  You play as a boy, with a little pet, you explore through levels and find treasure.
B00BAXFECK|2.0|Too long,  tend to lose interest when author gets too wordy.  The. Basic story was good, but did not care for the prolonged  drug induced mind wandering.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I wish there were more levels but no and each one is pretty easy, just somin to pass time thats all
B000ID37RM|1.0|when I tried playing it on my sony TV, the picture was very small and unwatchable.  I was not able to watch it.  It is otherwise a great movie.
B007N85POS|5.0|It's more fun and colorful! I love the additional birds, i.e., the blue bird and the one that puffs like a balloon :)
0345533666|4.0|This was a great read!  I chose it for my book group under pressure as I had failed to choose anything before we met to discuss our last book, and we all agreed that this was by far the best book we had read so far (we've done about six or so).  The only reason that I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 was because there is not a single character that is likable.  We all wanted to smack every single person in the story for being stupid or mean or otherwise a horrible person.  So if you are a person who needs to find a character to relate to and you aren't an awful person, you may not want this book.  But if you are looking for a book to get a conversation started, I would definitely recommend picking this one up.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I absolutely love this app! It has many more features than the first version. I love that you can color, wash, curl, straighten, dry and dress hair! It has cute, soft graphics and is lots of fun.
B00DAPOHU6|4.0|It's Jack Johnson and I love him, so I like the CD.  It's not that great though--songs sometimes sound the same.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I liked this whole series and although I was very disappointed in the ending so giving it 3 stars. It was written well, but it seems like the ending was rushed. The &#34;turning&#34; of Evelyn was not believable. The demise of the lead character was unnecessary. What else can I say?
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Great movie! If you can suspend your disbelief and just go with it then you can enjoy the ride. The action and visual effects are spectacular! The story is solid and the chemistry between the cast is reminiscent of the first cast of Star Wars-witty and connected!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|but now I will wonder what's next in Abra's life. I've been told I really need to read the Dark Tower series also
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I loved the first two books and couldn't wait for Allegiant, I hated the ending. I should have read reviews before I bought it.Total disappointment. The book was good but the end just made me feel bad. I won't be looking for Veronica Roth books anytime soon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Amazing game! I have had no glitches or lag with this app. I love the graphics as you work up to other sharks and feed. I have made it to the Mako shark, you start out with a Reef shark.
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|Great storyline. Very 1984 meets the modern corporate world.  However, the last chapter ruined it.  It was like he was tired of writing and wrapped it up in such a quick fashion that it left me wanting. Ruined it.
B000000993|5.0|This album is fully dysfunctional and rocks so hard.<br />If you haven't added this album to your collection of no nonsense rock, then do yourself a favor and buy it.
B003RT0NK8|5.0|I do not know how I missed this movie! It's a fabulous sci-fi!!! It's a pretty solid story with a surprising twist.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Not a big fan of the split writing,  but I understand why it was done.  Just wish Four had a more diverse personality from his counterpart.
B000Q6GUW0|2.0|This is a review of seasons 1-8.  I got hooked on this show because it was interesting, right off the bat.  The writing was excellent, for the most part, which led to nice twists and turns in the plot development.  Suspension of disbelief had to be along for the viewing ride, however, as some of the scenarios that go down in this series are way out there and would never happen in real life, but I'm OK with that.  Trouble is, by season 4, things got too disturbing for me to remain a real fan.  SPOILER ALERT:  Read no further if you don't want to know what happens.  I came to hate Dexter's sister.  She is seen as a whore who will do just about any guy, any time, anywhere.  Her ultra-foul mouth, at first amusing, got old, very fast.  When you added that to her open leg policy, I was hoping for her character to get killed off.  Dexter disgusted me, as well:  He kills two innocent men and then just goes right on with his perverse lifestyle, all the time citing a code that he has little trouble violating. When Rita gets killed, my limit was reached.  It was unnecessary, sad and too tragic for me to stay unaffected when it came to my dislike of the series getting stronger.  Things got worse.  Season five was not written as well as the preceding four seasons, and season six was pretty far off the mark. Things picked up in season seven, but suspension of disbelief had to be even greater in order to keep watching:  Dexter pays two kids to throw a ball at a guy, one of his mother's killers, whom he then gives the needle to and stows in his car.  Uh, might those kids look back and see what was going on?  LaGuerta discovers a prepped killing storage container with a running chainsaw and doesn't run a trace on the saw, the plastic and everything else connected to it? Finally, Deb kills LaGuerta to protect Dexter and herself from being discovered???  Gimme a break!  These two killers deserve execution if any two people do!  Instead, they remain heroes to the viewing public who arefans of this garbage.  Oh yeah, Hannah, herself a serial poisoner/killer, is Dexter's love interest.  Never mind he helps get her arrested after she tries to poison Deb.  Never mind she escapes and hooks up with him, again, and eventually Dexter lets her have his son along for the ride to South America.  Yeah, it really is this stupid and unbelievable.  True, I did get hooked on the series, early on, and shelled out more than a few dollars to watch the thing on Amazon Streaming Video.  That is a credit to the excellent writing in the first few years.  I only wish the series would have remained excellent for its complete run, but very few can.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I absolutely adore this app! The graphics are adorable, bright colors and cool animations. The actual game is based off the hit video on YouTube, where the little people die from dumb things. So in this app you save those people by, tapping, sliding, blowing, flicking and more, I guarantee you will enjoy it!
B00B7I8HZ4|3.0|I'm using this as an HTPC.  I've got a Silicondust HDHomerun Prime with cable card ( Comcast ).  4 gigs of memory and a 32 gig crucial SSD.  The operating system is Windows and I'm using Windows Media Center to watch and record TV.  I've got an external 500 gig drive attached to one of the rear USB ports for recording storage and a 2 TB drive hooked up to my router's USB.  I'm using the 2tb drive to store music, pictures, movies and videos.  I tried the router mounted drive as the primary target of WMC \\"recorded TV\\" folder as well ( more on that later)<br /><br />Setup via the USB was simple enough.  I first installed windows 7, downloaded the latest intel bios and windows driver and installed them.  My first hiccup came when I ran WMC cable advisor.  It reported that I don't have an adequate video card and wmc cannot be used to watch cable tv.  After some fruitless googling I thought I'd take a look at the Windows experience index.  It was reporting my graphic card at 3.1.  I reran the test and the graphics were up to 4.9.  Next I went into WMC and reran \\"cable advisor\\".  It passed.  Lesson - rerun Windows Experience Index after installing latest drivers and before running cable advisor.<br /><br />I experienced issues with my cable card ( picked it up in person).  My initial call to Comcast resulting in them telling me that there was something wrong with my HD Homerun, and, I should contact them for support.  I was doubtful so I went back to Comcast to exchange the card.  The Comcast guy opened a cabinet, grabbed a card and said \\"here\\".  I looked at the card - it was dented so I pointed that out to him.  He went and pulled another out of the cabinet  - this one was severely bent down it's length.  It looked like someone stuck it under a refrigerator and tried to bend it - it was clearly defective.  I asked for a new one.  He told me this was an exchange place only, that they don't have any new ones.  I asked him if they checked to ensure that they work before they hand them out and he said \\"no, customers return them and we put them in the box so we have them when somebody wants one\\"  ( I am not making this up!)  He had a total of 6 in the box, I grabbed 2 of the least worn he had - and they all looked bad.  ( the 2nd one cost me $1.50 a month, good short term insurance if I got yet another bad card ) .  After about an hour on the phone with Comcast I finally got escalated to the cablecard department.  Their number is 877-405-2298.  They set me up in about 2 minutes.  If you are dealing with a cablecard from Comcast I suggest you call that number instead of the general support number.  Incidentally, the guy at Comcast said there was not a cablecard department and I just need to call the standard 1 800 COMCAST to get it setup.  Of course, he also said it was activated and I just needed to plug it in ( also not true).  Anyway, it is working now.  Lesson learned - make sure you are talking to someone that can really help.<br /><br />Now, in WMC I can record 3 HD programs and watch another without issue.  Windows Task Manager reports that I'm using 40 to 60% of the CPU.  That's pretty good.  No issues at all with the USB 2.0 port not being fast enough, it's plenty fast so don't worry about that.  I was thrilled.<br /><br />I then tried watching a previous episode of Sons of Anarchy from the Xfinity website ( Used both Chrome and Internet Explorer browsers).  The stream to watch Sons required flash so I installed it.  I could watch the show, but my CPU activity was in the 80 to 100% range.  And, when I tried to record an HD channel in WMC while watching Sons the CPU pegged at 100% and starved WMC. Today I tried watching the same episode on my company supplied I7 laptop, the cpu averaged about 8% utilization.  I know it's not fair to compare a celeron to an I7 but I thought I'd share that to help frame the issue.<br /><br />Other issues, every once in awhile I get an error message in WMC stating that either my video driver or cardis not installed correctly, or there is no audio driver.  Whenever these errors occurs I have to restart WMC, which is only a nuisance.  Sometimes restarting WMC doesn't work and I have to restart the NUC.  That's bad cuz if I'm in the middle of recording something I will lose it.  It turns out that the NUC has no onboard audio.  It passes the audio down the HDMI cable for your TV or receiver to deal with it.  Not sure but I'm thinking that might be an issue for me.<br /><br />So here's why 3 stars - 1) not strong enough to support Flash and it seems many of the Network websites require it for streaming.  2) Flaky video/audio issues.<br /><br />On the plus side it's really small and looks cool next to your TV.  You can use a really cheap portable USB drive to store your media.  In terms of performance it's perfect if you're using WMC and NOT navigating to sites that require flash.  It's incredibly quiet.  I have to lean really close to it in order to hear any sound at all.<br /><br />Down the road I'll take a look at the new NUC I3, the one with USB 3.0 and built in IR.  It's about a hundred bucks more but I regret that I didn't give that one a try.  Maybe it would handle the Flash and still leave plenty of processor to handle my recording needs.<br /><br />Finally, I mentioned earlier that I tried using an external drive connected to my router's USB port.  That almost worked for WMC.  I had to make changes in the registry and bingo - WMC was recording to the drive.  However, it just wasn't reliable.  I don't know if the issues are with WMC, Netgear (router manufacturer) or something else.  Both the NUC and my router are 1 gig wired ethernet.  Bandwidth was no problem.  While recorded 3 HD and watching the recording of another I was only using about 10% of my bandwidth.  The issues I had were that I managed to lose some metadata relating to some recorded shows. Now they show up, but only as the file name with no date recorded or episode info.  Thought that was weird.  This was also the drive in play when Flash grabbed all my CPUs power so maybe that had something to do with it.  For now, I know that it is at least possible to use network storage for WMC but until I really need to, I'll stick with the NUC's USB and hook up a drive to that.<br /><br />In summary, while this NUC is pretty cool it just doesn't have enough power to provide peace of mind.  I'll be keeping it but I'll be careful not to tax the CPU while media center is in play.is not installed correctly, or there is no audio driver.  Whenever these errors occurs I have to restart WMC, which is only a nuisance.  Sometimes restarting WMC doesn't work and I have to restart the NUC.  That's bad cuz if I'm in the middle of recording something I will lose it.  It turns out that the NUC has no onboard audio.  It passes the audio down the HDMI cable for your TV or receiver to deal with it.  Not sure but I'm thinking that might be an issue for me.<br /><br />So here's why 3 stars - 1) not strong enough to support Flash and it seems many of the Network websites require it for streaming.  2) Flaky video/audio issues.<br /><br />On the plus side it's really small and looks cool next to your TV.  You can use a really cheap portable USB drive to store your media.  In terms of performance it's perfect if you're using WMC and NOT navigating to sites that require flash.  It's incredibly quiet.  I have to lean really close to it in order to hear any sound at all.<br /><br />Down the road I'll take a look at the new NUC I3, the one with USB 3.0 and built in IR.  It's about a hundred bucks more but I regret that I didn't give that one a try.  Maybe it would handle the Flash and still leave plenty of processor to handle my recording needs.<br /><br />Finally, I mentioned earlier that I tried using an external drive connected to my router's USB port.  That almost worked for WMC.  I had to make changes in the registry and bingo - WMC was recording to the drive.  However, it just wasn't reliable.  I don't know if the issues are with WMC, Netgear (router manufacturer) or something else.  Both the NUC and my router are 1 gig wired ethernet.  Bandwidth was no problem.  While recorded 3 HD and watching the recording of another I was only using about 10% of my bandwidth.  The issues I had were that I managed to lose some metadata relating to some recorded shows. Now they show up, but only as the file name with no date recorded or episode info.  Thought that was weird.  This was also the drive in play when Flash grabbed all my CPUs power so maybe that had something to do with it.  For now, I know that it is at least possible to use network storage for WMC but until I really need to, I'll stick with the NUC's USB and hook up a drive to that.<br /><br />In summary, while this NUC is pretty cool it just doesn't have enough power to provide peace of mind.  I'll be keeping it but I'll be careful not to tax the CPU while media center is in play.

B0052REUW0|5.0|This book for me ranks as one of the most important books I have ever read. It takes a scientific approach to the analysis of violence in humans (and other primates) over the millennia. Pinker dives deep into facts regarding violence in pre-state and \\"civilized\\" societies and matches those norms and trends against our current understanding of psychology and shifting moral codes. The book is exhaustively referenced and he supports each argument with well researched data. Steven Pinker is one of those rare and brilliant thinkers who is able to discern motivators and trends in extremely complex data sets and relate those findings in a way that the rest of us can comprehend. The book should be required reading of every politician, teacher and religious leader if not every high school student because I believe its importance to society can't be overestimated. Because of its import, it is also a commitment. I found myself re-reading many passages in the book several times to fully comprehend its meanings; but its payoff in revelations is absolutely worth it.<br />A truly stunning achievement!<br /><br />A more in depth review........<br /><br />This is a brilliant and epic analysis of the history of violence in human societies and presents a compelling argument for why violence in all its ugly iterations has declined, though not smoothly, over the past 5,000 years and particularly in the past 60.<br /><br />It's an exhaustively researched book with lots of credible data to back up its claims. It's one of those few books that challenge one's fundamental assumptions about what is fact and what is fiction about our selves, our nature and our history. It challenges long held beliefs about human behavior in family, groups, tribe, community, society, culture and nation. It demonstrates how specific identifiable forces, both innate and exogenous, have been at the root of violence over the ages. But it also shows how the \\"better angels of our nature\\" have worked to modulate those forces through a complex development of an increasingly higher social and emotional intelligence. Even with the recent epidemic of mass shootings in the U.S., the proliferation of weaponry and civil wars, Pinker makes a convincing argument that we've never lived in more peaceful times.<br /><br />Pinker follows a fascinating trajectory of our social and moral evolution and demonstrates how far we've really come, especially over the past few centuries. Even with the horrors of the wars of the 20th century, the slope of violence and aggression in world societies has been on an accelerating decline. With a long and sordid history of war, genocide, murder, torture, infanticide, human sacrifice, witch burnings, corporal and capital punishment, slavery, child abuse, abduction, serial killing, violent crime, racism, discrimination and animal abuse, human civilization is indeed living in a different era.<br /><br />He credits the increasing pacification of human civilization to a process of intellectual and social evolution that has driven us toward a more self aware, reason based, peacefully cooperative, morally fair existence. He shows that through the science of ideas, certain stabilizing forces and philosophies such as democracy, centralized government, open mass media, education, science, technology, feminism, trade and commerce have elevated the rights of the individual and expanded our circles of empathy making violence less sensical. He supplements this analysis with a look at the neuroscience behind human behavior via game theory and current psychological research demonstrating the physio and psychological mechanisms behind power, aggression, hatred, dominance, honor, revenge, social position, group think, cooperation and competition.<br /><br />He shows how evolutionary biology explains the logic of violence and its genetic motivators but also how we're wired for empathy and cooperation. He walks us through a long, detailed history of social custom, symbolism, male dominance ritual and conflict and through a scientist's lens exposes the culprits in our biological and social dynamic that have been at the roots of aggression over time. He also examines how concepts such as glory, honor, valor, national pride, holy land, mother land, eternal good, utopia, pure evil and religious ideology have wrought more misery on human lives than any other forces. Although he acknowledges the role some religions had in promoting civilizing forces such as marriage, moral compass, self-restraint and love-of-fellow-man, he believes the negative side effects of male dominant religious ideology and jealous-god worship outweigh its benefits in a rational society.<br /><br />Through man's difficult and often horrific journey over 5 milennia Pinker illuminates key modifiers, pressures and motivators that seem to have played both positive and negative roles in our harrowing trip to modern times. Pinker states that \\"...aggression is the output of several psychological systems that differ in their environmental triggers, their internal logic, their neurobiological basis and their social distribution.\\"<br /><br />He shows how our nature as highly social animals plays a critical role in what we choose to value. Citing various psychological research he demonstrates how differently individuals behave while in a group, often acting in complete opposition to what they personally believe in order to fit in, be accepted or move the apparent goals of the group forward. He shows the mechanisms behind mob rule, group think, loyalty to family, tribe and god and shows how these innate human characteristics can be manipulated to accept shockingly inhumane behavior on the part of individuals, tribes, nations and ideologies.<br /><br />Pinker cites some of the more significant breakthroughs in our moral development such as during Europe's Enlightenment period in the 17th and 18th centuries which brought forth philosophers, writers and artists who challenged traditional thought and through reason and and rational analysis introduced new ideas regarding the rights of the individual. He also cites mid 20th century acts such as the Declaration of Human Rights which led to a cascade of Rights Revolutions including civil rights, women's rights, children's rights, homosexual rights and animal rights which continue to unfold to this day.<br /><br />Pinker believes that those who claim that the 21st century western world, especially the US, has degraded into a pool of permissive, licentious immorality have their heads where the sun don't shine. He calls out the Republican right in the US and their warped sense of traditional values and romantic notions of a more civilized past and shows how their value score card is an archaic vestige of a different and LESS moral society. He shows the correlation between intelligence (especially abstract thinking), access to information, cosmopolitanism and moral behavior. He shows how and why \\"red state America\\" holds onto these antiquated mindsets and why the coasts and cities of the US are considered \\"blue\\", vote Democrat, and are more progressive.<br /><br />Pinker doesn't predict the future and states that it can all come unraveling in an instant due to the unpredictability of egomaniacs and the volatility of religious extremists in unstable regions of the world, but he remains optimistic. He believes there is enough positive momentum due to six decades of expanding empathy and cooperation due to technology, mass communications, education and global trade to put the odds in our favor. He also believes there's evidence that IQs are increasing worldwide, particularly abstract reasoning intelligence. He references several studies that show IQ score increases from 1901 to the present in dozens of countries. He credits cognitive environmental effects (literacy) and secondarily possible genetic selection effects.<br /><br />Pinker asks point blank if it's fair to say that our ancestors were morally retarded and he answers emphatically Yes! \\"Though they were surely decent people with perfectly functioning brains, the collective moral sophistication of the culture in which they lived was as primitive by modern standards as their mineral spas and patent medicines are by the medical standards of today. Many of their beliefs would be considered not just monstrous, but in a very real sense, stupid. They would not stand up to intellectual scrutiny as being consistent with other values they claimed to hold and they persisted only because the narrower intellectual spotlight of the day was not routinely shone on them.\\"<br /><br />Pinker's thesis for why violence has declined along with his forward optimism is derived from his perspective on evolutionary biology and its sub discipline neuropsychology. He believes because of homo sapiens' unique sociability, intelligence and communication skills we've adapted beyond the need for pervasive violence; it makes less sense. But through his convincing indictment of the culprits within our makeup he warns that civilization needs to maintain elaborate regulators within our social systems to keep our lesser angels in check.l thought and through reason and and rational analysis introduced new ideas regarding the rights of the individual.

B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|A fast paced mystery which draws the reader in to the story.  The computer tech twists and turns were a new element to the saga.  I would recommend to those who enjoy Baldacci.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This was a severe disappointment to an otherwise fabulous series. It was so terrible that I do not recommend reading it at all unless you want to be left frustrated and angry. (SPOILER ALERT) While I do not need a book to have a happy ending (I am almost 30 years old and love a good cry at the end of a novel) in this case the final chapters were anticlimactic and contrived without any sense of finality. In fact, when I finished the book my first thought was, \\"That's it? That is the ending?!\\" Furthermore, I felt as though the only reason the author decided to have Tris die was to shock the audience but rather than shocking me, I felt that the story was unfinished and that she took the easy way out. I do not necessarily think that Allegiant had to have a HEA but I do believe that this otherwise well rounded trilogy deserved an ending that tied up loose ends, which this book did not do.  While the first two books were dynamic, interesting, and well paced with fantastic character development, this one just fell flat. Perhaps my expectations for this novel were just too high.
B009TGODOK|2.0|Great acting, wonderful music, and beautiful settings, but another inconsequential story about the trivial angsts of wealthy, navel-gazing New Yorkers.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|There are only a few &#34;Grisham books&#34; that I have enjoyed, and this was one of them.  It was one I had difficulty putting down once I began reading it...
B009NF54ZE|4.0|Pros: fun story line.  Hidden objects that are hard but not impossible to find.  Has a nice hint feature.  Has mini games so it's not always about hidden objects.  Cons: every time I touched the screen it was counted as an error leading to time penalties which were unjust. Why can't I move the screen without getting penalized? Second, spelling errors were present. It's a 'skull', not a 'scull'. Still worth playing.
0767827716|5.0|Great movie. I like this version because i prefer the older style dvds has both full and widescreen version of the movie and the old movie poster graphics on the cover. No dvd extras really but its the movie that makes it cool. Ive seen the dvd extras on the newer version and theres not really anything all that great. A couple of the extra scenes are details from the book but nothing all that special. PS-The Christine audio book is available now-I highly reccomend if you are like me and have trouble paying attention to a book but can listen to one. They always say the book is better than the movie. In this case the movie is so cool how could anything possibly be better but the book/audio book is so awesome. Theres way more going on in the book that they couldn't possibly fit it all in the movie. From a Buick 8 is another good one.
B002AWX6UM|5.0|Ishmael Beah is a gifted writer who is able to tell the story of human transformation and transcendence. My university students find the book challenging and inspirational.
031603441X|5.0|What a great autobiography.  My favorite parts of the book are when Keith gives incites in to his guitar playing.  The Stones folklore is good to hear in the first person, but I really dig his commentary on the evolution of the electric guitar.
B00DHRLK84|3.0|While I thought this would be very good, it was mediocre, whereas the Bourne Legacy, which I thought would suck, was actually pretty good.

B001Q94TQA|5.0|Fantastic movie. Indie films don't really benefit from the visual and sound quality that Blu-Ray offers but this movie needs to be in your library if you enjoy a quality story with a great soundtrack.
B00846F1YW|3.0|It is a great game except installed on my Kindle.  It is very difficult to see the things needed as the screen is too small to capture it all.  I have to repeatedly go back until I can finish each scene because of the difficulty to see what is needed, especially when it comes to using a flashlight on the screen.  Well thought out but again, difficult on the Kindle.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I loved this game on facebook but it was really slow. Now that it is on kindle fire it's the best thing ever,but you don't get to customize your own character:( other than that it's very fun:)

B008JFUO72|4.0|Third time’s the charm, isn’t that how it goes? Except usually not, at least as far as film franchises go. Third time is usually where the gasp of creativity that breathed life into the series to begin with finally starts to run out, leaving the filmmakers with one of two possible options: either keep repeating what has worked already on larger and larger scales ad nauseum, or break the series apart and come at it from a brand new angle.<br /><br />Fortunately, Black is not going to let anyone rest on their laurels. He’s given a real think at how to advance an Iron Man story beyond what has come before and the result is not only the cleverest action beats in the series to date, but the most work Downey has had to put into them. In fact, for all the many dozens of suits of armor flying around through the film and all the people wearing them (at one point it seems as if the entire cast is put into a suit at one point) Iron Man 3 actually boasts the least Iron Man of the series to date.<br /><br />On the downside, along with the armor, a lot of Tony’s supporting cast tends to come and go for long periods, particularly once he disappears into rural Tennessee to follow up a lead. Sure they get stuff to do – Happy follows some suspicious characters and sets the plot in motion, Rhodey once again backs Tony up during the action finish after doing little else the rest of the time, and Pepper actually gets into the action movie game for the first time, particularly during the middle segment when she briefly gets a suit of her own.<br /><br />But then they disappear so that Downey can go off and trade quips with a 10 year old for 30 minutes. Which is, it must be said, far better than it sounds due to Stark’s inability to actually be sappy but it’s still hard to feel like you’re being gipped somehow. After two films setting these characters up and making you care about them, they are shipped off because now no one knows what to do with them.<br /><br />Those are generally small quibbles, though, as “Iron Man” continues to set the bar for Marvel’s solo superhero films through a combination of wit, charm and out and out entertainment. It’s not quite as good as “Iron Man 2” – but then I’m one of the few who thinks Iron Man 2 is the best of the series – but it’s not far off and certainly does no shame to the series. I don’t know how many more of these they can make, but so far it doesn’t look like they’ve run out of steam quite yet.generally small quibbles, though, as “Iron Man” continues to set the bar for Marvel’s solo superhero films through a combination of wit, charm and out and out entertainment.

B007QPFGJW|5.0|Nesbo renews my faith in the crime novel but more so, the fallible hero within this genre.  Not since early Arkady Renko novels - Gorky Park and Polar Star, have I loved a central character within a book so much.  I've read all the Hole novels except Cockroaches which won't be released in English until next year and can truly say, that each one gets progressively better.  Don't get me wrong, all are excellent, but i'd suggest you go in order starting with The Bat.  You won't be disappointed until you realize that there are no more Hole novels to read.....
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|This is not a show that's just meant to create laughter. It's funny and meaningful as well. The family 'lesson' at the end of each episode may not apply to every family, but at least, the show tries to tell a story through the hilarious situations.<br /><br />Love the cast and the crew! They're truly talented. The mockumentary idea really works here. Hope the following seasons won't be a turndown.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|What a brain tease! Absolutely love it and would recommend it for those that want their brain juices going!! Won't get old with all this thinking!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|We love Castle and all the characters. When TV went digital we were reduced to only a few channels so we watch DVD series and this is one of the best.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|I started reading this series when it was first released and now I am rereading it.  This is one series of few that not only warrants a second pass, it deserves it.<br /><br />The author has created characters and a story basis that are foundations of modern fantasy that rival even such classics of fantasy as The Lord Of The Rings.<br /><br />Yup, I said it.
B00ANA27IU|5.0|Not quite as confusing as [[ASIN:B000HEBCZQ the movie]], but it does try its hardest. It's also much shorter than one might expect, given the fact that the movie is just shy of 54 hours long.
B008BM9L72|5.0|love it - entertained me and educated me<br />Enjoyed the story line and the love story<br />I was also nice at the end to have the writer give you the storyline of the male character and what he was thinking - enjoyed that
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|The cinematography was the only redeeming aspect of this film. Poor acting all the way around, the plot is not only weak it's stupid. This movie never pulls you in to the point you care about the characters.  A waste of time.
B004P12SSW|5.0|Like all the other reviews have already stated, yes, the story line for this movie is nothing new. We've all seen this story of a talented small town girl that moves to the big city and becomes famous and all that stuff. What makes this movie great, is the musicals. I loved every single one of them. Cher was amazing when she performed her songs, and Christina Aguilera's voice was perfect for all the songs she performed. I knew she was a great singer, I never knew she was such an AMAZING dancer. Every song was performed estupendous and the dance moves were outstanding. This was Christina's debut but its was a good one. She blew my mind with her awesome dance moves and performances in the movie. This movie will make you smile and will not bore you. Great movie definately recommend it.
140006922X|5.0|Not knowing anything about the history and lore of Jesus Christ I was just planning to read this book as a precursor to the &#34;definitive history boo&#34; - Killing Jesus.  Was I surprised. Unlike O'Reilly's book, Zealot tries to differentiate between 'history' and 'faith'.  The author calmly points out the acknowledged history texts written within 100 years of Jesus' death describing life in this period (none of which mention a character such as Jesus).  He also compares the descriptions written in the 4 gospels - consistencies and differences and makes the point that these are 'faith-based historical documentation' written many years after the fact by authors who were instrumental in fostering the development of Christianity.  The books authored by Paul took the legends of Jesus to heights never mentioned by the original Gospels.<br /><br />As I went through this book, I felt that I was reading a history book, complete with many historical foornotes and attribution to many noted historical authors.  When I got to Reading Killing Jesus, I was very disappointed.  It was a very interesting read, but clearly the 'history' that Mr. Bill refers to, is primarily the faith-based New Testament, rather than unbiased works by recognized scholars.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book doesn't insult.  It assumes you are brilliant and looking for brilliance.<br /><br />Seven more words required...I don't have any.

This is a book with many twists and turns but everything made sense.  The characters were people that you cared about and couldn't wait to find out more.  The last 50 pages had numerous reversals but in the end it felt just right.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun little puzzle game, challenging yet delightful. The challenge increases nicely with each level, becoming a little more MacGyver meets 007 with every advancement. Well done.

B002VT6C0K|5.0|I  ordered this book because  it was the selection of my book club.  I had certainly heard of Alice Munro, but never read anything she had written.  I love her style of writing.  It tells a lot in a few words.  Her stories were so original and well crafted.  she lets you know what is going on in her character's heads and when the story finally concludes, you have to think a bit about what actually happened.  From now on, when I hear the name Alice, I will jthink of Alice Munro rather than Alice In Wonderland!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I bought one on day 1 and I love it. I'm tired of switching it back and forth between my two TV's, so I bought a second one on black Friday for $30 (can't beat the price - even the standard MSRP is great for what you get). I know, first world problems.

B0042RJWTC|4.0|I'm watching for the first time & am just starting season 4.  Have enjoyed the series immensely as far as the quality of the acting, costumes & sets go.  However I was extremely disappointed with the &#34;freezing in place&#34; I encountered in seasons 2 & 3.  Could not view the final scenes of Anne Boylen' s execution or a part of the wedding of Henry & Anne of Cleves.  Could not return the set as I had received it several months ago but had to wait for a professional to figure out how I could access the closed captioning.<br /><br />My two daughters & I are steeped in the Tudor era (books & movies) so this technical difficulty was most unfortunate.
1476727651|5.0|Loved it! I finally found out what happened to Danny from &#34;The Shining&#34;, and let's say he has had an interesting life. It gets even more interesting. Loved it....all the big King fans will too.
B000EGDC0A|3.0|liked ooh la la , a lot. The rest of the CD is growing on me, the more I listen to it. It's rare for me to purchase a CD, based on a song I love, and really like the whole CD from the first time I listen to it.
0307887448|5.0|It's been a long time since I have read a book in less than a week (I'm a slow reader).  But I loved the plot and found it very hard to put down.  The story was not only a good read, but also thought provoking as one looks to the future of fully immersive  gaming.  I loved all the 80's references (like a trip down memory lane of the best of the 80's.)  Overall a great read and one I will remember for a while.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Great graphics, great sound, great integration with the console, and a huge inventory of unlockable characters and items. The only caveat is that the gameplay boils down to a button masher, with the only strategy present being in how you utilize your special moves. The fun is in how you evolve your  characters and spend credits. Any fan can dig this but people expecting a deep fighter are in for a surprise.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I've had a few problems with it locking up. Otherwise, very fun. A lot of friendly people play which makes it more entertaining.

B00005KHJR|5.0|As fans of THE WICKER MAN know, the original 1973 film exists in two versions. There is the original 102 minute version released overseas and then there is the truncated 88 minute version that played in only 3 cities in America before quickly disappearing. Unfortunately it is this truncated version that survives in pristine footage. The 102 minute VHS version isn't bad at all which is why I have issues with the composite 102 minute version that is currently available on DVD. As with the recent restoration of METROPOLIS, it bothers me when the restoration incorporates pristine and non-pristine footage, The distracting effect of varying visual quality pulls you out of the movie which is the last thing you want in a film where concentration is a necessity. In both cases complete originals exist and in the case of THE WICKER MAN the original is in much better shape so they really should have transferred it intact rather than adding the missing scenes to the 88 minute version where the difference is rather noticeable on a flatscreen TV yet a composite transfer is currently all there is. As a result I'm hanging on to my original Media VHS but of the readily available dual-versions, this particular set has the best picture and is available at a good price. There's also a nifty wooden case to boot.<br /><br />It's hard to imagine that there are people out there who don't know the story especially as the core of it was seen more recently in the unfortunate Neil LaBute 2006 remake with Nicholas Cage. With over 400 other reviews to choose from there are plenty that go into the story in great detail but here is only a basic outline. A deeply religious policeman (Edward Woodward) investigates the report of a missing child on a remote, privately owned island off the Scottish mainland. The island is inhabited by modern day pagans whose joyous, happy lifestyle contrasts greatly with the dour, puritanical officer. They are led by the local squire (Christopher Lee) whose family has owned the island for generations and who actively encourages the pagan practices. Writer Anthony Shaffer (SLEUTH), twin brother of playwright Peter Shaffer (EQUUS, AMADEUS), has constructed, on the surface, a simple mystery. Police officer investigates the disappearance of a child. His investigation is obstructed by the locals. He perseveres and finds the child alive. The End. Not quite. There is much more to it than that. It is that \\"much more\\" that makes THE WICKER MAN the classic that it is. Great soundtrack too. If you've never seen it you should. If you've only seen the Nicholas Cage version than you really need to see it the way it was intended and this set is an excellent way to do just that.wned the island for generations and who actively encourages the pagan practices.

B00EQK5OG0|5.0|Any fan of the brilliant and classic Fisherman's Blues/mid 80's era Waterboys will love these 6 discs of extra material. There is an amazing volume and variety of quality music here - much of it experimental seeming for the Boys. My favorite is disc 3 (the famed Bob Johnson/Berkley 12/86 sessions, with the 26 minute \\"Soon As I Get Home\\") and my least favorite is the heavily country-western disc 4...., but the point of this collection is inclusive completeness, and it is all a lot of fun. These are the original versions, warts and all - incomplete lyrics and nascent ideas, but they are fine examples of creative genius and playful discovery, and come across as amazingly complete and realized expressions.<br /><br />For a more detailed breakdown of the discs/songs look at Red and Black's fine review here. This is just my 2 cents worth of whole hearted recommendation.<br /><br />Beside the often rough and tumble performances, the sound quality of these discs is excellent, the packaging fine (I got mine from amazon.uk and there were no stuck sleeves as some reported), and Scott's detailed liner notes clearly a labor of love, and at $35 bucks it's a real deal.

For game play, there is nothing that I particularly dislike but there is nothing that excites me about the game either.<br /><br />There is only one gripe I have &amp; that is about the screen size. The text is especially hard to read on the main screen &amp; within the scenes, the items are small &amp; you cannot zoom in enough for easy viewing.
140006922X|5.0|When I was considering buying this book I wondered how someone who came from a background of Islam and born in Iran would portray Jesus. I learned that Aslan was a scholar holding a Ph.D. in the sociology of religions from the University of California in addition to other degrees and is a writer of international fame.<br />Aslan was born in Iran and came from a family of as he puts it \\"lukewarm Muslims and exuberant atheists.\\" The Iranian revolution made his family flee Iran and at the age of fifteen he was converted to Christianity at a summer evangelical youth camp in Northern California. He later, after much study, became convinced that: \\"The bedrock of evangelical Christianity, at least as it was taught to me, is the unconditional belief that every word of the Bible is God-breathed and true, literal and inerrant. The sudden realization that this belief is patently and irrefutably false, that the Bible is replete with the most blatant and obvious errors and contradictions-just as one would expect from a document written by hundreds of hands across thousands of years---left me confused and spiritually unmoored. And so, like many people in my situation, I angrily discarded my faith as if it were a costly forgery I had been duped into buying. I began to rethink the faith and culture of my forefathers, finding in them as an adult a deeper, more intimate familiarity than I ever had as a child, the kind that comes from reconnecting with an old friend after many years apart.\\" [Azlan, Reza. Zealot: Author's Note, p. xix. (New York: Random House. 2013)].<br />He continued his work in religious studies and after decades of academic research finds that he is a more committed disciple of Jesus of Nazareth than he ever could be of Jesus the Christ. Throughout the book there is always the juxtaposition of two concepts: \\"Jesus of Nazareth as the Historical Jesus and Jesus the Christ which is the creation of subsequent writers including Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and Paul who never knew the Historical Jesus because among the gospels none of them are written by the people they are named for with the possible exception of Luke and all were written by persons who did not know Jesus of Nazareth while he was living and were written many years later.<br />He warns the readers that \\"for every well-attested, heavily researched, and eminently authoritative argument made about the historical Jesus, there is an equally well-attested, equally researched, and equally authoritative argument opposing it.\\" He has recorded the sources for other arguments, also, but presents his view of what can be known of the historical Jesus in this book.<br />To some people the notion that Mary and Joseph had to go to Bethlehem because of an order to go to the places of their birth because of an order of the Romans has been puzzling because it appears that no Roman record of such a thing exists. Aslan offers a very intelligent explanation of the need for Jesus to have been born in Bethelehem and how this story came to have been in the New Testament.<br />Also, it must have occurred to many people that there is such a distinction between the Jesus of the New Testament and the Teachings of the early church that it is necessary to attribute to Paul the creation of the Christian Church. Aslan gives extensive and thorough arguments in support of that hypothesis in this book.<br />As far back as the 1960's and possibly before studies of the beginnings of Christianity seemed to indicate that Jesus was a revolutionary figure. I think that Aslan has made a compelling argument that this is the case.<br />Some scholars have thought that the historic Jesus cannot be found. I believe this was the viewpoint of Albert Schweitzer after his study of the problem. Aslan correctly points out that even though very little has been documented of the Historic Jesus the Romans kept quite good records of the first century and beyond and it is possible to reconstruct the times in which Jesus lived.<br />Pontius Pilate is shown to have been a cruel procurator although his mention in the gospels has been whitewashed to appeal to the Romans and the Jews were maligned in a gospel causing two thousand years of anti-Semitism.<br />I have had a vague notion of the Second Temple in Jerusalem and knew that this was destroyed by Titus in about 70 C.E. In this book Aslan gives a literary picture of that temple so vivid that one can almost smell it and see the various parts of it. This was an outstanding portrait of that Temple which was the site of so many happenings and the seat of so many High Priests prior to the dispersion of the Jews by the Romans.<br />I think that the persons who will most value this book are those who are aware of the scholarship regarding the Bible and are aware that the viewpoint of the scholars does not necessarily conform to the viewpoint of various churches. In trying to excuse this Aslan makes the distinction between Jesus the man and Jesus the Christ. Jesus the man being an illiterate Jewish peasant from a tiny village named Nazareth and Jesus the Christ being the Jesus who was created by the Paul and other writers  seeking to appeal to the Greeks and the Romans. In this Jesus the man is lost to the New Testament and Jesus the Christ becomes the Jesus of organized religion. This is a valid distinction and one that persons believing in a literal acceptance of the Bible stories find hard to make.<br />If Jesus is placed firmly within the social, religious, and political context of the time in which he lived with the revolt against Rome that transformed the faith and practice of Judaism, then the biography of Jesus in some ways writes itself according to Aslan.<br />Most modern Christians would not recognize this Jesus but this Jesus may be the only Jesus that can be accessed by historical means. All else is a matter of faith.<br />Aslan states that there are only two historical facts about Jesus of Nazareth upon which we can rely:<br />1.\\"Jesus was a Jew who led a popular Jewish movement in Palestine at the beginning of the first century C.E.\\"<br />2.\\"Rome crucified him for doing so.\\"<br />Aslan writes that his book is an attempt \\"to reclaim, as much as possible, the Jesus of history, the Jesus before Christianity: the politically conscious Jewish revolutionary who, two thousand years ago walked across the Galilean countryside, gathering followers for a messianic movement with the goal of establishing the Kingdom of God but whose mission failed when, after a provocative entry into Jerusalem and a brazen attack on the Temple, he was arrested and executed by Rome for the crime of sedition. It is also about how, in the aftermath of Jesus' failure to establish God's reign on earth, his followers reinterpreted not only Jesus' mission and identity, but also the very nature and definition of the Jewish messiah.\\" [Aslan, Reza. Zealot, Introduction p. xxx. (New York: Random House, 2013)]<br />According to Aslan, when these facts are combined by what we know of the tumultuous era in which Jesus lived and a lot about this is known thanks to the Romans, the Jesus that emerges is not the gentle shepherd of the early Christian community but a zealous revolutionary swept up in the turmoil of the first -century Palestine.<br />To justify this belief Aslan points out that:<br />1. Crucifixion was a punishment Rome used almost completely for the crime of sedition. The plaque hung on the cross stating \\"King of the Jews\\" was like plaques hung on all the other crosses showing the crime for which he was executed. The crime was striving for kingly rule or treason. This was the same crime that all the other messianic aspirants of the time had been executed for.<br />2. The men on each side of Jesus were in Greek called lestai translated into English as \\"thieves\\" but which actually means \\"bandits\\" and was the most common Roman word for an insurrectionist or rebel.<br />Aslan states that the above image of the crucifixion should cast doubt on the Gospel portrayal of Jesus as a man of unconditional peace separated from the political upheavals of his time. The term \\"Kingdom of God\\" would have been understood by Jew and gentile alike as implying revolt against Rome. The notion that someone talking about \\"Kingdom of God\\" could be uninvolved in the revolutionary forces that gripped nearly every Jew in Judea is simply ridiculous.<br />He next considers the question of why the gospel writers went to such lengths to temper the revolutionary nature of Jesus' message and movement.<br />It is necessary to realize that almost every gospel story written regarding the life and mission of Jesus was written after the Jewish rebellion in 66 C.E. against Rome. These rebels somehow managed to take the Holy Land away from the Romans for four years until the Romans returned in 70 C.E. The soldiers destroyed everyone they reached who was in their path and set fire to the Temple. Everything burned. Josephus wrote that there was nothing left to prove Jerusalem had ever been inhabited. According to Aslan tens of thousands of Jews were slaughtered and the rest were taken from the city in chains.<br />Aslan believes that there was a spiritual trauma suffered by the Jews because of the above. They were exiled from the promised land and forced to live as outcasts among the pagans.<br />The rabbis deliberately divorced Judaism from the radical messianic nationalism which had caused the war with Rome. The Torah replaced the Temple in Jewish life. Rabbinic Judaism emerged.<br />According to Aslan, the Christians also felt a need to distance themselves from the revolutionary zeal causing the sacking of Jerusalem not only to protect themselves from the wrath of Rome but because, with the Jewish religion becoming pariah, the Romans had become the primary target of the church's evangelism.<br />So a long process of transforming Jesus from a Jewish nationalist into a spiritual leader having no interest in earthy mattersbegan. The Romans could accept such a Jesus.<br />After the destruction of the Temple in 70 C.E. and Jerusalem destroyed what remained of the Jerusalem assembly dispersed and Paul took over the Christian community. Except for a hypothetical work known as the Q document the only literature about Jesus existing in 70 C.E. were letters of Paul in circulation from 50 C.E. These were letters of Paul to the Christian communities left known as the Diaspora communities. Without the assembly in Jerusalem to guide these communities the movement's connection to Judaism was broken. Paul became the person by which a new generation was introduced to Jesus the Christ.<br />According to Aslan there is a trace of Pauline theology in Mark and Matthew but the gospel of Luke which was written by one of the followers of Paul shows the dominance of Paul and the gospel of John is Paul's theology in narrative form.<br />In 398 C.E., according to legend, a council in the city of Hippo Regius gathered to canonize what was to become the New Testament. They chose, according to Aslan:<br />1. One letter from James, the brother and successor of Jesus.<br />2. Two letters from Peter, the chief apostle and first among the Twelve.<br />3. Three letters from John, the beloved disciple and pillar of the church.<br />4. Fourteen letters from Paul, the deviant and outcast who had been rejected and scorned by the leaders in Jerusalem.<br />Aslan states that more than half of the twenty-seven books that now make up the New Testament are either by or about Paul.<br />Aslan does not consider the above surprising because after Jerusalem was destroyed Christianity was almost exclusively a gentile religion which needed a gentile theology. Aslan believes that is what Paul provided.<br />The choice was between the vision of James of a Jewish religion following the Law of Moses coming from a Jewish nationalist who fought Rome, and Paul's vision of a Roman religion divorced from Jewish provincialism and requiringnothing for salvation but a belief in Christ. It was not difficult for second and third generations of Jesus' followers to make this choice.<br />In Alan's words: \\"Two thousand years later, the Christ of Paul's creation has utterly subsumed the Jesus of history. The memory of the revolutionary zealot who walked across Galilee gathering an army of disciples with the goal of establishing the Kingdom of God on earth, the magnetic preacher who defied the authority of the Temple priesthood in Jerusalem, the radical Jewish nationalist who challenged the Roman occupation and lost, has been almost completely lost to history. That is a shame. Because the one thing any comprehensive study of the historical Jesus should hopefully reveal is that Jesus of Nazareth-Jesus the man-is every bit as compelling, charismatic, and praiseworthy as Jesus the Christ. He is, in short, someone worth believing in.\\" (Aslan, Reza. Zealot. New York: Random House, 2013 Page 216.)<br />I believe that Aslan has accomplished his goal of presenting the Historical Jesus in the context of the times in which he lived. He has referenced more than one hundred twenty seven books by various scholars in support of or against his views and articles by more than forty-one different scholars.<br />The book is highly readable by non-scholars as well as by scholars which accounts for Aslan's previous and current success as a best selling author and I do not hesitate to recommend this book to all thinking persons.
B0091QS88K|5.0|The Dr. Panda games are great! My 2 quickly picked up on how they work and is always the first game he wants to play. We have a few of the different ones and they are all just as fun! My 7 year old enjoys them as well! Would for sure recommend!!!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows.  I know it started slow this season but it keeps on getting better :)
B003MXD694|4.0|This movie entertains on two levels. Children will enjoy it but the plot line and the humor are  sophisticated enough to<br />entertain the adults
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is an excellent way to kill time and is fun for all ages. Me and my nine year old son take turns playing the levels.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|It's good but it takes up a lot or room but it's very good but the final fight with the lizard is very hard good luck
B004KPX4W2|2.0|wife fell asleep, predictable, but still some fun ... no mas no menos. please never ask me to rate a film again.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|hard to find TV worth watching these days and this is very good TV.  The acting is superb. The attention to detail for the period (the sets) is also top shelf.
B00CDCLL1A|5.0|MY most favorite movie to date. I tried to read the book but the book is crazy, and I could not understand it until I saw this movie. It is so involved, I had to watch it a few times.<br /><br />What a great story, and how it is crafted over time is truly an amazing looking into how we effect the world around us and our future.
B006VRDZ44|5.0|A fascinating, engaging series.  Beautifully filmed, great acting by a fabulous cast.  The series encourages further study about the Prohibition era.
B000QUUD60|3.0|The original DVD in this set is actually MONO sound with original Dolby noise reduction only - not good at all for today's listening.  The extra stuff on both DVDs is interesting and worth seeing.<br /><br />The 2nd, remastered DVD is in Dolby 5.1 BUT the sound is only ok.  The drummer has a 2 bass drum setup yet base is so poorly done that you really don't hear the bass drums at all.  You do catch the bass guitar.  They tell on the DVD that the went back to the original 16 track tape to remaster the sound but only did a fair job.<br /><br />I'd buy this again at a relatively low price ($10 or so) but know what you are getting.  Supposedly the Aloha From Hawaii has much better sound but it's been back ordered on Amazon for months and seems to only be available for about $24 used - I'm not interested in paying that much, especially when I'm not sure the sound will be what I'd hope for.
B0000A98ZP|4.0|Excellent product and movie. Just as its shown. A good collection item for those who liked DVD movies. Totally Recommended.
B001BANK32|5.0|I saw the movie first and wondered what the book was like, and I have to say I'm glad I read it.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Very good<br /><br />I found this book to be very true to the small american town, stranger arrives they all know but when he ask questiond they all become very unknowing and fear the stranger. This is a good picture of coal minning town owned and run by the company and what the people fear from the company.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|I always enjoy a good heist movie. This was just that, but with an entertainer twist. I agree with some that the love interest between the the FBI agent and Interpol agent was forced and strange but it's hard for movies not to incorporate romantic entanglements and I've learned to ignore it. The story itself was both tried and true (modern Robin Hoods and secret societies) as well as being fresh (magicians). Not to mention Harrelson and Eisenberg are still hilarious when paired together, and hearing Morgan Freeman explain things is always amazing.<br /><br />I think it's better then most movies that are being released these days and I'd be happy to watch it again.
B00000K3UU|4.0|Excellent product and movie. Just as its shown. A good collection item for those who liked DVD movies. Totally Recommended.

B00H1O3Q18|3.0|Overall, I feel like Walking Dead has really deviated too much from the original season where there was a genuine intenseness in the plot. Now it just feels somewhat generic.<br /><br />As far as Amazon Instant Video is concerned, I do like that it gives me the options to watch shows without actually owning cable, but I've had numerous instances of videos freezing over and over to the point I had to just try again later. A minor inconvenience at that, but still annoying.
B004FS1TLM|5.0|Seriously?  You have to ask?  It's Michael Buble!!!!  Bring on the romance!  I'm lucky enough to have a man that loves this kind of music, a glass of wine and a fire place...  What can I say, I am blessed ~

B00BATG18K|3.0|Once past the opening chapters, this book became very predictable.  Not my favorite Amy Tan by far.  The Chinese backdrop was fascinating but not the story within.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I enjoyed it. The first 25-30% of the book was slow, and even after it started rolling I took my sweet in reading it - nit because I was savoring it either.  All in all I give it 4 stars.
