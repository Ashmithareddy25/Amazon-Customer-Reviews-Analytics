B002PEP4SC|4.0|It was easy to follow.Not so many characters that I got lost.  When I quit reading or got interrupted it wasn't long before I was picking it up to read another chapter.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|My whole family loved this game and added it to their kindle. The only thing is I wish it was longer or a lot more versions!
B006LSZECO|1.0|From the beginning of the book I doubted if there was much to be excited about.  The ending was horrible.  I can't believe 2 individuals can be such idiots.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the best app ever its chalging and so much fun its so good for older children its so much fun
0004244079|5.0|Very pleased with the book. I was a little surprised to see how small the actual copy was as the copy I had years ago was very thick and bulky. When I got my replacement copy, I was a bit worried the full story would be missing and very surprised and pleased to find it was the full story in a smaller, easier to hold book. I would like to find the copies of Little Men and Jo's Boys in the same format if possible.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Addicting game. I like it more then Temple Run. It's more then just turning and jumping and you rack up coins pretty quick. Recommended for sure.
1451627297|5.0|I loved this book. If I had read it in book form, I might have been a bit daunted by its length, but who knew on the Kindle!<br />The characters are totally convincing, and the tensions in the plot carry throughout. I have recommended it to many others.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Seems to do a good job tracking battery life. It looks like it gets more accurate as time goes on.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book moved along at a pretty fast pace...some repetition, but a good storyline!  Just finished the<br />Fifty Shades Trilogy, and was pleased with the ending. Maybe not a book for everyone, but my friends and I are having fun discussing it!!
0307389839|5.0|Murakami = rhythm; Haruki sings the blues.<br /><br />He says:  \\"The sad spreadsheet of my life.... reveals how much my debts far outweigh my assets.\\"  However, value is the inverse function of that depreciation...<br /><br />The balance sheet measures depreciation of what he can count...but who he is he finds in the soaring wail of Rhapsody in Blue.  He didn't stray from himself...and he didn't get stuck...<br /><br />This book can get you close to the bottom line.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this website! I'm addicted.  Such creative, interesting,  amazing, ideas for everything and anything. This website is for every one.
B007TK77QE|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, although I must admit, I wasn't really knowing what to expect, with all the different reviews here on Amazon. It is a LOT different to the Harry Potter series ( of which I am an avid fan), But it is an Adult book, not a child's nor tweenagers. It has adult themes, ranging from drug use, sex, and self harm, BUT all are pertinent to the story. Yes, there are heaps of characters in the book, but so has the Harry Potter series, and I had no trouble keeping up with them all.It is all about village life, the politics of a small community, and between those who think they are \\"top dogs\\" and those who know they aren't. The story goes along at a brisk pace, and I did not once get bored, or read something else. I would recommend this a a good read, and have no hesitation recommending it. I am really looking forward to her next book, and hope it is not too long before it is written.
B000HEWEDK|4.0|I must admit, for a 50th anniversary edition, I expected the picture quality to be better. Don't get me wrong, the picture does not suck, it is good, just expected better for a 50th anniversary edition. As far as the movie goes, and anyone who has ever seen it knows, it is just a really great science fiction movie for its time. Still a classic today! Any sy fy fan who does not have this should get it!
1401235417|5.0|I haven't read the book yet. So why am I reviewing it you ask? Because of Amazon. I have a friend who is always worried about getting his comics and graphic novels online because of the possibility of it getting ruined in shipping. This caused me to be concerned as I am just getting back into comics. It's been 15 year since I've purchased a comic, back when Comic shops were the only way.<br /><br />Well let me tell you. My concerns are relieved. It came in perfect condition without any signs of wear. Frankly it would probably get more wear sitting on the shelf at the comic shop as people take them off the shelf to look at.<br /><br />So if you have ever been concerned about that don't worry. Amazon takes great care to ensure you receive a great product in good condition.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|I loved this book. I couldn't put it down. For any major Direction er, like me, you'll love it. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to get to know the boys and what they have been through. It really gives you their point of view instead of someone else. Highly recommended.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awsome. I love this game ive played it on pc and now i can play anywhere i go! I highly recommend purchasing this game.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|Ski Safari is a great example of how to do a tablet game right. Simple controls (just tap or hold), smooth graphics, fun music and objectives that keep you coming back. Fun and addictive!
1451662432|5.0|A remarkable lesson in what you can achieve given a plan, perseverance, and as Arnold put it: reps, reps, reps.<br /><br />The book offers a fascinating perspective into the beginnings of the body-building as a sport and a market. It is telling that Arnold describes his involvement in the sport as much as a marketer and a promoter, as a participant. What started as a niche attraction, within a niche market (fitness), grew to something much bigger in large part thanks to Arnold's own work - there is a lesson there for all of us.  From there, he was able to turn his success on the small stage of the body building circuit into a Hollywood movie career, both of which also gave him the name and the public awareness to enter into the arena of politics. All of these threads are intertwined, creating a remarkable and an inspiring story.<br /><br />You may disagree with how the author behaved at some points on time, his political stance, or family matters, but regardless, this is both a great personal story, and an educational one for everyone looking to make a dent in the universe.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm so glad they finally came out with this app... and it was well worth the wait. No problems whatsoever!
1449410243|2.0|I'm a fan of theoatmeal.com.  I thought the $8 would be worth it to support Mr. Inman, even if the book was potentially light on new material. Unfortunately, though, the amount of new material is so small that I regretted spending even such a piddly amount.  I'd have rather had the two lattes from Starbucks.  When not considering the old material, I got about 3 minutes of entertainment from the book.  Overall a little disappointing.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|I love this game! no matter how much time I have this game can fulfill my entertainment requirements.  always a pleasure thanks for making simple enjoyable.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I felt throughout the book Dr. Alexander explained so much where we all wanted answers.  A wonderful, wonderful full of knowledge read.
B000E33W1W|5.0|My boys (4&6) caught a few minutes of this movie on TBS or one of those channels and got a real kick out of it. So, I decided to buy the movie and they LOVE it. They're running around the house now singing the Ghostbusters song nonstop!
B0091REZMW|5.0|good game hard and easy at same makes you think out side the box<br />enough Said play the game you will like it
B008JF8O9M|3.0|I have Printbot installed on a Vizio Tablet.  It does work but it's extremely slow from the time I choose print until it comes out the printer.  Is it the Tablet or the Program I don't know, but as long as I get any kind of print output I'll keep it.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This book is life changing! I can't wait to try this lifestyle change. The book is easy to read and follow.  He has nothing but facts and tons of research studies to back his theories. I'm glad he was diligent enough to look at the facts of research and studies with an open mind and look into the biology of why people get fat. Everything makes sense even if it goes against what all major health experts have been telling us for decades. Thank you Gary Taubes for being brave enough and putting all this time to publishing this incredible book!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|ive been waiting since Christmas last year! i had to play it on my dads i-pad but now ive got it on my kindle fire!! yay!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I enjoy reading about our Military and have read many books accordingly.  I would put this book in the upper tier.  In addition to the historical nature of the mission which ends the book, reading about the authors lead up and training were very interesting too.  A quick and enjoyable read.  I would recommend to anyone.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|loveeeee it......this game is so addictive i love it my kids love it it is worth the download....its more fun than real life...forget other games this one is worth the time...
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I have this on my Kindle Fire. My latest update for this game was Piglantis. That was about 2 months ago. Everyone else in my family has the newer updated version with the haunted house levels and such. Why hasn't the Kindle version been updated?
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|If you don't love this book by the time you finish the last page, you either didn't understand the meaning behind the book, or you have no soul. I'm only a 13 year old girl, and came across this book while searching for a good book to read. I didn't know what it was about, and I didn't have to. John Green has a way of filling your heart with such amazement, such gratitude for those who have died trying to fight their way passed with truth, of their death, and for those who have lost the ones they cared about most. I found myself crying hysterically in bed, totally engrossed in this touching story. I fell in love with Augustus, just as Hazel (my fictional hero) did. I've had this story in my personal library for a while (if you consider two weeks a while) and started reading it on Friday - two days ago.  I'm telling you now, if you're a person who will cry during reading any book, be prepared to have people asking our if you're okay. This is the first tine ever that I've cried during reading a book, and every word I felt a pain in my chest that told me I had fallen in love too hard with this book. I have no complaints with this book - everything was written beautifully, all characters had brilliant personalities....I couldn't have asked for more. Why can't there be more love stories like Hazel and Augustus' ? Well, I guess that's the brilliance about this book. There is no love story like Hazel and Augustus' .
B009MCRHH6|5.0|this is a really good game I play it on my computer and its great but I play games on my kindle fire and this game is $4.99 it should be $.99 cents like all the other games .
B007UW9VWO|5.0|I came across this movie and it is not only beautiful because of the delicate and passionate art of sushi, but the life teachings that are displayed throughout the film; which, by the way, arrived in a perfect moment of my own life. Enjoy!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is one game that I can't put down. Some of the levels are so frustrating, and I find myself turning my Kindle upside down for a fresh perspective - and it works! I'll be really sad when I complete all the levels. One of my favorite games.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Mesmerizing music...what an amazing band!I have been listening to Babel rather often and never tire of how lovely this CD is.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this game. My sister and I play. Also really like where's my water.<br />Don't know what else to say.
0307720950|3.0|An interesting book, and perhaps a look into the near future.  But it's not nearly as good as his first two books, and does not provide the same paradigms to view the evolving marketplace.
B007ZXQNGA|4.0|This is great book for anyone contemplating starting a business or anyone running a small business. Where the book really shines is in the fact that it focuses on micro-businesses (i.e. the very small ones).<br /><br />The book is perhaps more on the motivational side than something like the 4 Hour Work Week but in many ways I found it as inspirational. I found the book chock of really great ideas and through provoking stories about what can work even with such small businesses. I would certainly put this book up as something that small business people should read and do so on a regular basis.<br /><br />Its content is modern and easy to read. It is more focused perhaps on providing inspiration for the micro-business and demonstrating that you don't have to be big to be successful. It will leave you will plenty of ideas and suggest that you can take into your own business but it is not really focused on creating processes to achieve this. That is something you will have to find elsewhere.<br /><br />When you are a micro-business the world appears to be very intimidating in a big pond that we call the economy. However, reading this book should inspire these same micro-businesses that they can not only survive and compete but also succeed. It will hopefully provide them with a range of suggestions that they can implement themselves and greatly improve their chances of success. Most importantly, it demonstrates that the greatest capital that is required is simply imagination and the determination to succeed.<br /><br />For anyone running their own business, this is highly recommended read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is gonna rock because my best friends told me that this game is awesome so I just was thinking why not buy and play it.
B008MEM24S|5.0|It is hard enough to be challenging but not so hard that I pull my hair out.  As good as the Where's My Water game.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Wonderful book.  I loved the use of so many voices throughout. It really displayed the author's talent of being able to tap into the point of view of many types of people, which I find astonishing.  And I like how all the narratives dovetailed into each other.  Highly recommend!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game may not have the same software as the Pc version but its not fully updated. I thought it was a great game for it being the alpha version and all. I'm waiting for the next update and I'm pumped! so stop posting the negative reviews!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game. Very addictive and perfect for times you just want to unplug from the world and not think for a while.
B0053XM7ZU|5.0|If you enjoy epic fantasy then this is a must read.  Do yourself a favour and start with the first book in the series.  You won't regret it - just brilliant!
B00742GBDM|1.0|Other than the movie being completely off base it is also disgusting. I couldn't even finish it I was so infuriated. A far cry from what I or any other Jane Austen fan would deem respectable and worth a penny. I want to know when lust and sex became art? Tell me why directors and actors feel a sick need to ruin anything wholesome? The novel has its dark happenings in the shadows not in the full front of the show! The novel has wonderful morals and ideals throughout it and unfortunately the director decided to cut it all out and turn it into crap. There was no need for the director to ruin a great story with her dark and twisted view of art. I wish there were a way to vomit garbage images from my mind the way I can with food. I am so angry with this pathetic attempt of a Jane Austen  story
0446547654|5.0|This was as good as the other books he has wrote. Enjoyed it. Brew a cup of tea and sit and enjoy.
B0072NWJRK|5.0|I first heard about this book on the Diane Rehm show (NPR Cape and Islands), it was a re-broadcast this fall. Paul French read some from his book and it became clear as the interview went on that he had spent countless hours researching every detail of the horrible murder. His account, with timelines, kept me guessing who the murder was peaked my interest. His historical background on Old China taught me many things I was unaware of in that era of the 1930's. Great read, have recommended it to all my friends.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|fun little app with big results!  Easy editing and enhancing! Love to frame my pics!  This app has a good verity!
B0053O89Z6|4.0|Great set of discs, and lots of good extras (ie deleted scenes, bloopers). My only complaint is they only did one commentary per disc, as opposed to two in the previous seasons, and there were so many good episodes they could've done commentary for on this season, whereas others probably could've used just one per disc. Otherwise, definitely worth your money.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app! I use it on my Kindle fire. it is much better then using the web browser.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This game is pretty cool. Made it all the way through lVl 70 with only a 1.99 in game purchase.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a great app for kindle fires! I had almost no problems with it, and it was so helpful for my crafts and parties! You will enjoy!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book gave insights into the training, the constant preparation of special forces to meet the challenges of the various missions they were or will be assigned. The stress of being away from home and family whether training or on some of the critical missions facing our military men and women at this time. It is an easy read and most interesting descriptions of some of the missions. The most insightful parts is the trust and total dependence of the team members on one another. The special relationships among the members of the teams. The tender care and recovery of the wounded. The psychological development of blood brother relationships as each contributed their share with their own blood and sometimes the ultimate contribution of their own life. A good read.
B004JMY312|5.0|Great movie! Great quality and steaming! Blast from the past! Forgot how good this movie was and how much better childrens movies were back in the day.
B001L5ZMK6|5.0|I really like this soundtrack. There are, suprisingly, a lot of songs on this soundtrack. The songs are relaxing to listen too. They are kindda like the soft rock or café rock that you might hear in a Starbucks.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Good game to pass the time. some challange in later rounds. Nothing too fancy but good play. Kid friendly good.
B004RLO0EA|5.0|This is an awesome soundtrack that I listen too everyday. I recommend it as a CD to have in anyones' collection.
B003Y5H5F6|3.0|A good premis, but how does a baby develop when your kept frozen? And mostly the daughter growls and looks scary and only at the end of the movie does the action get good. Charles Dance is very good as the coven leader. I hope they bring back Scott Speelman for the next movie, it's just not the same without their romance in the middle of all the hell!
B001ED7C58|5.0|I do not like the movies but I get the albums. There is a great mix of song on here and I do have respect for Robert Pattinson as a singer. He has a great voice adn really adds to the mood and tone of this album.
B002BWP49M|5.0|I'm old enough to be all the actors mother, but still find the whole Twilight Saga charming. The acting is very good and Rob Pattenson is his usual sexy self, this is the first time he has to struggle at something without Bella at his side, but all works out well. If you love the other movies, you'll love this one too. The only thing was there were only a couple bruises, what's the big deal? For him to be so upset they could've marked her up a little more. The sex scenes were sweet and tastefully done, love it when he moans! But why did the other vampires stop hunting when she comes home pregnant? Just remember its a modern fairy tale and go with the flow and you'll enjoy this movie too.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a really fun and very easy game!!!  Simple and a great way to spend a few extra minutes here and there!
B005LAIGWS|3.0|If you watch it as a separate movie with almost nothing to do with the first then it's very good and entertaining. The action sequences are well done, and Nicholas cage seemed to let himself go a little and have some fun in the part. The only disappointment was that Peter Fonda was available and could've played the devil again, I don't know why they didn't use him. The new devil is pretty good too, but no Peter Fonda.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game!!! It's addicting and one of my favorite! I can't seem to get enough of it. Try it...you'll love it too'
0689835604|5.0|this is a great book. I bought it hoping my son would learn the body parts and he has. he loves lifting the flaps!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like how it hooks to my facebook, now I don't have be on facebook to play. I also enjoy searching for objects like this game allows me to do
0316228532|1.0|Please do not waste your money on this one! I realize this is supposed to be a novel for adults, but really?!  She is trying so hard to distance her self from the potter books that she went way over the top with the vulgarity. I am very unhappy with this book.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I play Mahjong on my computer a lot.  I was glad there were Mahjong games on my Kindle Fire HD that I purchased from Amazon.  It was the first game that I purchased and I love it.
B006MW3VC4|5.0|Great period piece set around and during WWI... the lives and social restrictions of the wealthy and their servants are shown as they deal with the changing world around them. Highly recommended!
B00425S1H8|5.0|Worked with the drivers that came with it out of the box.  Two other models - same brand, I could not make work.
0385344333|1.0|I liked the book until I got to the punch line. Syrians trying to launder money in the USA. How silly. May be he should write now a novel about Reacher trying to help them get rid of Assad.
0345803507|5.0|Great book
0385341008|5.0|Beautifully written. I fell in love with each and every character including the island which is a character all on its own. Left me wanting more!
0345803493|5.0|Great book
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Very good combo ...I can view diff versions across devices and quality of special features is also good .the quality of 3 D is also very good
0316228532|5.0|The introduction was a little difficult to get through because of the introduction to all of the characters and their positions but the book gains momentum shortly afterwards. Mid way through the book I didn't want to put it down!
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|This book started rather slow, and the characters did not come to life as one expected.  I found it difficult to capture the attraction between Maggie and Laurent. It just did not seem believable. However, as a mystery, the book unfolded quite well, and the end was rather exciting with both the police and Maggie turning up at the same time to face the killer.  If Susan Kiernan-Lewis had been able to go back and tighten the beginning of this book, it would have been a five-star read.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Kept my interest from the very beginning.  Took no time to \\"get into\\" and I must say the plot twists were totally unpredictable.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games are fun for a free app, but they are too simple. other than that I like the app.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I am a Twilight fan. I love the way Stephanie Meyers writes. So I tried the 50 Shades and liked the story line however not as well written as the Twilight series.  After 50 I moved on to the Crossfire series. I liked Silvia Day style of writing much, much better than what I found in the 50 Shades series. All are great reads but the Crossfire Novels are a bit more polished compared to the 50 novels, and almost as good as Twilight.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Loved the plot in the story as well as the continued growth of the relationship of Eva and Gideon. The suspense and the strength of Eva was truly heart rending. Eagerly awaiting Novel number 3.
B009QWNQTA|5.0|My family and I were hooked from episode 1. \\"Once\\" is a long awaited for break from all of the talent shows, reality shows, and murder cop shows. Thank you cast, crew, directors, producers, and writers!
B000089RV6|5.0|It took me long enough. When I first purchased this album in 1980 (from my scarce, and hard earned cash) I wasn't that much impressed. Sure, Hell's Bells I listened to until my ears bled and the needle was dull. And Back in Black. When my Mom wasn't around of course - after all, everyone knew that hard rock came directly from Satan. But the rest of the songs didn't really click with me. So, after a few moth on the turntable, it pretty much slipped from my mind.<br /><br />Now, much too many years later I was rummaging through my attic, and that old vinyl fell into my hands, re-kindling an urge to listen to it. No longer having a turntable, I got the CD. And started listening. And was, if you excuse the cheap pun, thunderstruck.<br />Perhaps it's the way contemporary music is written. Sure, I love Foo Fighters, Shinedown and Pearl Jam as much as the next guy. But dammit, *this* is rock. Raw, straight, earnest, no frills. The way it's supposed to be.<br /><br />What way back when sounded merely OK now simply amazes me. The whole record has not a single filler piece. It radiates energy like few others do. A true Masterpiece. 'Hell's Bells' and the others are are monumentally exquisitely crafted songs - but my true discovery are 'Shoot to thrill' and 'You shook me all night long'. Yeah, I know, sometimes I'm slow on the uptake. Thirty years in this case. But I get it - now. As a rock masterpiece it stands up there with Rush's '2112' and Iron Maiden's 'Number of the Beast'.<br /><br />If you are starting just now to discover what AC/DC is about, this is the album to start with. Everyone else already knows, I guess, so I'll just shut up now.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Absolutely captivating.  I have read over 140 books on my Kindle and this is the first time I have even considered writing a review.  The story line is unique and entertaining with unexpected twists.  The characters were well developed and as the series continued I began to develope a vested interest in all of them.<br />I am now off to buy volume 6.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Child has given us a look behind the scenes of how these groups use fear and brain washing to get and keep their followers.
B000KNE0Y4|1.0|The watch is beautiful, no doubt about it but is not durable.<br />Main cons I found:<br />The plastic c-shaped ornaments break easily.<br />The clip (pin) gets unsteady after 1-2 months.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|Nothing objectionable---how rare for any movie and my daughter loved it!  She loved Tink and her sister.  Loved the whole thing.
B005BOX7BE|5.0|Looking forward to catching up with this series. I started watching Season 2 and was sorry I missed Season 1. I thought this was a good beginning for a new series.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|A friend bought one of these a while back and I fell in love with it and had to buy one for myself. This thing is built like a tank. Some people don't like the weight but I love it. I have big hands and the handle seems like it's made for me. Some reviewers don't like the kydex sheath, I have no issues with it. I did remove the hanging belt loop part because it's worthless but other than that, I love every aspect of the knife.
B005LAIHYU|3.0|This movie is pretty fast paced, if you blink for too long, you can miss quite a lot. I am part of the MTV generation, so faster pace does keep me more interesting in a film, but this one I felt could have been slowed down a little bit. Not just that, but you go from Abe's childhood, to a young man to him being president very quickly, and it feels like something has been missed out on in-between... maybe someday a director cut will come out that gives the pace of the film a reasonable flow, but I felt this one just goes a bit too fast. The beginning and middle I didn't enjoy that much, but the final action scenes where done nice enough to keep me away from twiddling my thumbs and just enjoy the excitement.<br /><br />I don't have to explain the plot to you do I? I'm sure you know who its about and what he does.<br />Overall, I'd say rent it before making any decision to purchase your own copy. For me, it's not one I would watch again for a while, but it was good for one nights entertainment.
B000001G5L|5.0|The many opportunities I've had the honor to sit in the orchestra performing Beethoven's Violin Concerto with various fine to excellent soloists and orchestras, the tempi for each of the movements and sections therein have very rarely been dissimilar to those chosen by Anne-Sophie Mutter and Maestro von Karajan in this recording.  As with all recordings coming new to me, I try hard to subdue any \\"first-one-I-ever-heard\\" bias and this recording of Beethoven's Violinkonzert was the first one for me during my student days.  I have been a huge fan of it since the first hearing, and I continue to treasure it to this day, regardless of how much I try to find fault with it when compared to the myriad others available, old and new.  To me, and to many musician friends and colleagues, it sounds JUST right.  Mutter is more fully dedicated to this performance than in her later one and is more so than any other soloist except perhaps in my other favorite recording with Christian Ferras performing live in 1951 in Berlin with Karl Böhm conducting the Berliner Philharmoniker and now available on Audite.  Ferras and Böhm are only a minute faster in the first movement than Mutter and von Karajan but, if you consider the long cadenza and the differences in the soloist's expression during it, it could easily make up for 20 seconds or more of the minute difference between these two great recordings.  (The second and third movements of Mutter's and von Karajan's performance are timed very similarly to many other recordings so I believe the argument as to how \\"slow\\" this recording is pertains only to the first movement.)<br /><br />By the way, it's tiresome and getting VERY old to read and/or hear the vitriol with which amateurs and other self-appointed experts refer to Herbert von Karajan.  The highly respectable Richard Osborne, longtime contributor to Gramophone Magazine and von Karajan's first MAJOR biographer, is enthusiastic about much of von Karajan's work -- not completely or blindly, though -- and his professional opinion far outranks the neophites.  One thing CAN be said, though.  If Herbert von Karajan was no good, no one would still be talking so much about his recorded legacy.  In my opinion, even at his worst, much of von Karajan's work is still better than most.<br /><br />The DVD of Mutter, the Berliner Philharmoniker and von Karajan performing this work is wonderful too.  I only hope that all of von Karajan's Sony videos are remastered visually -- and sonically even better than they've since been done -- for blu-ray.
B009CPRYG2|5.0|This movie is as close as you can get to actually reading this comic, it was a great adaptation and a great film all together.
B007RTAR64|5.0|I puchased my Katniss doll a little while ago, and I absolutely adore her. Mattel paid very close attention to detail and created a tiny masterpiece. Katniss comes dressed in her survival outfit for the \\"Hunger Games\\" and she would make a great addition to any collection.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is one of my favorite games to play it is a game that once you start playing you'll never stop
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Great Sci-Fi flick to watch. I found to be pretty original compared to a lot of the junk that is coming out these past years.
B000R8YC1I|4.0|This is the last DVD release of Jim Henson's ambitious but flawed fantasy film.  \\"The Dark Crystal\\" is basically not available for purchase new on DVD anymore.  For those who do not yet own a Blu-Ray player - or do not want to watch this streaming - I offer this DVD review of the \\"25th Anniversary Edition.\\"<br /><br />The Story Of The Film:  A thousand years ago on a world very different from our own, the titular crystal was shattered and two races appeared: the evil and ambitious Skeksis and the good but lethargic Mystics.  A prophecy however, tells that a member of the race of Gelflings will return a broken shard to the Dark Crystal and end the Skeksis' reign of terror.  Naturally, the Skeksis wage a war of genocide, wiping out the entire Gelfling race... or so they think.  In order to keep the prophecy alive (and get this movie past the opening credits) the Mystics rescue a Gelfling child, Jen, and raise him until the day he can set off on his quest to heal the Dark Crystal.  On this quest Jen (and the viewer) will discover that he may not be the last of his kind after all, that the Skeksis and the Mystics are connected in a vital way, and that puppetry - even the wizardly puppetry of Jim Henson - can only go so far.<br /><br />When this film came out in 1982 it was very ambitious: it has no human characters and all of the characters that are in it are played by puppets (basically... more on that below).  It is set on an alien world - there are few points of reference for the viewer.  The main protagonists are humanoid, but the other creatures are some of the strangest you'll see in a fantasy film.  The technical challenges to pull this off were staggering, and the result is very unique and certainly watch-able, but very mixed.  The main appeal of \\"The Dark Crystal\\" is visual - this film is gorgeous.  Henson and company really have created a whole other wondrous world on the screen, thanks mainly to Conceptual Designer Brian Froud.  Froud supplied the initial drawings and visual ideas to Henson and co-director Frank Oz who then collaborated to put them in their finished form on celluloid.  This movie has its own mood... a weird, funky vibe.  It can also be beautiful to behold - long shots of the Castle of the Crystal or of the traveling Mystics come to mind. The creatures themselves are (mostly) also wonderful to behold.  For the most part, they do not seem like puppets but like real, breathing creatures (I'll get to the exception in a bit).  The Mystics (four-armed lizard things) and the Skeksis (dinosaur-buzzard things) come off better than today's CGI creations... you forget that they are puppets and accept them as characters.  Of the other characters, Aughra, the Old Wise Woman (every fantasy movie requires by federal law an Old Wise Man/Woman character) comes off the best, although this is no surprise seeing as Frank Oz (who plays Aughra) was responsible for Yoda from \\"The Empire Strikes Back.\\"  Speaking of which, as I was watching this, I swore that I recognized the voice of the Dying Emperor... turns out that he was played by Jerry Nelson, who did Skred from those Muppet segments in the early days of Saturday Night Live.  So there's your trivia for the day... and now you'll never be able to watch The Dark Crystal without expecting Chevy Chase to show up.<br /><br />For all of its good points this film has a major flaw, and that is its two leads: Jen and Kira, the Gelflings.  Unfortunately they are dull characters, and have almost no personality.  This is obviously a problem, as these are the protagonists of the movie and thus take up a lot of screen time.  I felt that even the cute sidekick dog character (\\"Fizzgig The Friendly Monster\\") was more interesting and had more personality than these two.  It also doesn't help that the Gelflings are not convincing; you always feel that you are watching puppets.  The problem is that they are the most humanoid creatures in the piece - we the viewers expect them do look human and act in a humanlike way.  Jen and Kira though do not move in a convincing human manner or look detailed enough - they move and look like puppets.  Another problem is that in some of the long shots of Jen running, climbing, etc an obviously human double is used.  The contrast between the human movements in long-shot and the puppet movements in close-up are very jarring.  The makers of this movie should have just used human actors for these roles.<br /><br />For this \\"25th Anniversary Edition\\", \\"The Dark Crystal\\" is presented anamorphically in its original aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  The picture is very good for a film made in the 1980s: there is little grain and no evident damage (scratches, etc.).  Subtitles are provided in English, French and Japanese.  On the sound front, this movie is presented in Dolby 5.1 and sounds adequate.  The music certainly sounds very good (the Trevor Jones score for this film is excellent) but the dialogue and sound are just a little on the flat side (but this probably just the limitations of the source material).  On an interesting note, a Japanese audio track is provided... you should listen to this at least once, it's a hoot!  Since all the players are puppets its syncs up surprisingly well, and the voices actually sound appropriate to their characters!<br /><br />The extras for this 2-disc edition include a Making-Of documentary entitled \\"The World of the Dark Crystal\\", two self-congratulatory \\"reflections\\", a deleted scene, work print scenes, character illustrations and previews for other Henson products.  \\"The World of the Dark Crystal\\" is a TV documentary from the time the movie was produced and is very informative as to how it was made.  It really is fascinating to see how Henson et al created this.  The two \\"reflection\\" pieces \\"Light on the Path of Creation\\" and \\"Shard of Illusion,\\" are not really that essential, as they basically contain the people who made the film waxing on about how good their creation is and going off likehigh school English teachers on the symbolism and themes of the movie.  The deleted scene is superfluous and one can see why it was left out of the final film; the \\"work print\\" scenes are a selection of scenes from the movie as it originally sounded - the Skeksis speak in their own language and the voices for some of the other characters sound different.  Worth viewing once. Also included on the movie disc is an audio commentary by Brian Froud.  This commentary contains the same information as the making of documentaries though, so you really don't have to listen to it. In fact, I'm baffled as to why it's included.<br /><br />Looking on Amazon at the various versions of this movie (most are now out-of-print, including this) I can say that this is no great upgrade to previous DVD editions (although I am not sure about the video and audio, as I have not seen any of the previous discs).  This version lacks the theatrical trailers and isolated music track of the previous single disc edition and the content new to this edition (the commentary and new \\"retrospectives\\") are not earth-shattering or essential.  The current Blu-Ray release has all of the features of this and more, plus (presumably, I do not have it) better video and audio.  Buy this only if you do not have a Blu-Ray player and want \\"The Dark Crystal\\" on DVD.
B007TK77QE|2.0|I was not thrilled to turn next page in any point. Nothing exciting in the book. Characters are too many but depicted in a shallow manner. The narration is dry and dispassionate.
0062127241|1.0|First of all, let me state that Pete's music, solo and with The Who resonate with me on a deep level. I'm a huge fan.<br /><br />My disappointment comes from the fact that as a fan of the music, I wanted insights into that music. Instead, I spent a few hours reading in banal detail all about Pete's boats, cars, travels, (named) houses, various affairs and of course drugs and drinking.<br /><br />No insight into why the drugs and drinking either. It's almost as if he's excusing it because he's a rock star.<br /><br />I was saddened by his cavalier attitude to Karen and the kids as well as the death of his so-called friends, particularly Keith and John.<br /><br />I was expecting more particularly because I've read more insightful articles and interviews throughout the years.

B008J34466|5.0|Here we are again with a new P!nk album! It's about time!<br />Now, her previous albums were AWESOME, don't get me wrong, but this album just has something different. When I was anticipating it's release, I began to wonder whether or not it was really going to be worth my while to buy it. Well, I'm proud to say that it is worth the while! Now, I'm speaking for the deluxe 17 track edition (not to neglect the 2 iTunes tracks: Chaos and Piss and Timebomb, and the Japanese release, or the b-side of Blow Me: The King Is Dead But The Queen Is Alive).<br />This song is strong from start to finish, and it is a testament of P!nk's music. This is what she has been building up for all these years. Finally, she's unleashing her full potential with this CD, which is 13 (standard) or 17 (deluxe), or 15 (iTunes Deluxe), or 14 (Japanese) tracks of love music. Yes, love music.<br />The morning it came out, I was very intimidated to call WalMart (as a guy) and ask for The Truth About Love, to see what they had. But, I did, and now I have it! I can say firsthand that this CD has a lot of surprises from P!nk. Take everything you've come to love about P!nk, double it, then you have The Truth About Love!<br />I really enjoyed this album, and will continue to enjoy it until she hits the road on tour, when I will see her live, only to go come and CONTINUE loving this album!<br />You won't regret purchasing this!
B0090P98Z4|3.0|I absolutely love this game. I hate that once you reach level 51 you stop leveling up and the game resets. after getting to the fifth dungeon on hell fire I'm quite upset. I'm glad I accumulated and upgraded my weapons and armorial to come home to start at the tutorial. the same thing happened to my boyfriend. I read other reviews of this happening....this should be fixed.! I also read that an update allows players to reach level 60..that clearly is not the case.  I haven't seen anyone above level 51. can I get my game back? its such a bummer that I don't have my gold dragonscale armor anymore :( oh well.
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|I can add nothing to what others have probably said about this movie by now. If you haven't watched what is undoubtedly the finest superhero movie ever you're in for a treat. Superior writing, excellent graphics and decent acting - it's all in there. Children and kids at heart will stand p and cheer - especially for Big Green. Buy it, watch it, and watch it again.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|So many twists and turns..very unexpected. Couldn't put it down.  Would definitely recommend this book to others.  A must read.

B009NPKTN6|1.0|Was really looking forward to seeing this one with so many top named star but it was horribly disappointing. I sat through the whole thing only because the music brought back many memories.Everyone played such a screwed up part.Not worth my time, even with all the big names.
B005WYFLNU|3.0|I got this for my daughter and was happy that it is made like window stickies so they really are reusable (some sticker books claim to be reusable but don't do well the 2nd time around) but the pad is really big and bulky on top of having a lot of little pieces.
B008NW67E0|5.0|you're always anticipating a new album, and it's hard to follow amazing first album. glad to report they did it they did it again. Amazing job, beautiful music! so much fun when you don't have to skip through songs...that you want to listen to the whole album!!!!!!
B007HJA5IO|5.0|This is a very complex story, and you really need to read the books to catch it all, but it is very true to the book, the acting is great, the sets could not be better. easily 5 stars.
0525952926|1.0|I am avid fan of Ken Follett and eagerly awaited the second of the trilogy. I bought and listened to the audio version. From the opening sentence, I was assaulted by different characters and stories which seemed at best confusing. I ldid love learning more about the events leading to World War II and the perspective given from characters representing three different countries. However, I was sadly disappointed by the jumpiness of the prose and particularly by the ending. This is not a novel that Mr Follett can be proud of.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I got this app when it was the free app of the day. This is one of the best, easiest to configure VNC viewer apps I've ever used, and I've used many, and several for Android. I've not had any problems at all.

1451695195|5.0|The physical reality we see and experience in our lives is limited by our knowledge, which is built upon human experience, understanding of science, and our religious/non-religious upbringing. From the point of the author, even if he is well accomplished neurosurgeon with a highest education, may find it difficult to sell the idea of near death experience. The Christian fundamentalist or a puritan of scientific education or a rational thinker; they all are limited by their scientific or religious dogmas and remain closed to new thoughts and experience that challenges their traditional thinking. In this regard, the author has shown extraordinary courage in writing this book in spite of the fact that much of his peers in academics may laugh it off as irreverent experience and think that he must head-back to the loony bin. Readers open to learning near death experience and other non-explainable occurrences welcome Eben Alexander's courage to talk about his experiences.<br /><br />For seven days the author laid in a deep coma and his body unresponsive, and higher-order brain functions were off. On the seventh day his eyes popped open. He has no scientific explanation for the fact that his mind, consciousness, and the inner self were functioning all along. He explains that the world where death is the end is not an end at all, but consciousness continue to survive.<br /><br />The near death experience of the author puts him in a place of big puffy clouds, pink-white ones that showed up sharply against the deep blue-black sky. At vastly higher region; flocks of transparent, shimmering beings arced across the sky, leaving long, streamer like lines behind them. They were different from anything known on this planet. The author believes they were more advanced higher forms. The sky was filled with glorious chant, which was the joy of these creatures. The sound was palpable and almost material, like a rain that you can feel on your skin but doesn't get you wet. Seeing and hearing were not separate in this place. The author describes the visual beauty of the silvery bodies of those scintillating beings above, and he could see the surging, joyful perfection of what they sang. The message he got from his deep consciousness was; \\"You are loved and cherished, dearly, forever,\\" \\"You have nothing to fear,\\" and \\"There is nothing you can do wrong.\\"<br /><br />This new picture of later-reality described by the author will probably be understood much better as we make more progress in understanding how consciousness, the laws of quantum physics, and physical existence are interrelated. It won't be finished in a decade or a century; it may be longer when scholars will be looking at the experiences of Eben Alexander in newer light. Many quantum physicists believe that spacetime, matter/energy and consciousness are interconnected into one never ending continuity in a multiverse concept.<br /><br />Much has been written on this topic from the Christian approach, but not with scientific, medical and spiritual approach. If you are a true seeker of supreme consciousness and the transcendental Ultimate Reality, this book entertains you tremendously.<br /><br />1.

B008H5J510|5.0|As a big fan of Katy Perry, I ordered this limited edition combo set with high expectations. I am glad that my expectations were met when my movie came in even before the expected arrival date with my movie in flawless condition. I would definitely order from this seller from now on for my movie needs.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|Everything just feels so right in each song. Brings you up, makes you feel like you can take on the world. Some how able to do this in a relative mellow beautiful way. Great singing, passionate supported by great almost haunting music but with energy.<br /><br />One Republic has to be one of the most underrated bands out there. If I were stranded on an island I'd definitely want their latest 2 CD's with me.

B0098PX68G|5.0|This movie was so beautiful.  The scenery was fantastic, and all of the actors were amazing.  This movie made me laugh, it made me think, and by the end it had me literally sobbing face down in the floor.  But I watch it over and over again!

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is a very fun and well thought out game that requires little skill. very addicting and easy to play for hours on end.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|the book was electronically sent fast easy to pay for good story line still reading it nice continuation of the story.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is the best action movie ever; full of action and funny at the same time. I can't wait for part 2.
B00110K62U|5.0|I love the story of Les Miserables!  People who love this story will probably follow this format well, but if you have not had previous contact with the story this format may confuse you.  The booklet provides all the missing information to the story as this is not really acted out. This cast is phenomenal and they are probably some of my all time favorites.
0761158820|5.0|My son Sam is an eight-year old third-grader and he loves this book.  He has made six monsters so far.  I often need to help along the way, holding the tabs together until the glue sets, inserting tabs into slots, etc., but he can do a lot of it himself.  Our most important advice would be to start with the easy monsters, and keep a few toothpicks handy to help with applying glue and opening the slots.  Soon you will have a menagerie of menacing monsters for your enjoyment.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Let me sum this ridiculous movie up for you and thereby save you time and money.<br /><br />**** (SPOILERS) ****<br /><br />Some people go to space to find the \\"Engineers\\" that created us.<br />They find some goo. One guy unintentionally eats the goo.<br />He has sex with a women. Within one day of sex, she has a squid for a baby; the baby was removed by C-section.<br />The squid-baby grows really large and kills an Engineer (who was trying to kill the squid-baby's mother).<br />An alien jumps out of the Engineers stomach.<br />The end.<br /><br />The effects were cheesy (you will laugh at the \\"scary\\" scenes) and the story was poorly written.<br /><br />I was looking forward to the exploration of (what I thought was) the central topic: mankind's creation.  But there was none of that. At the end there were no answers to the big questions of life, just a set-up for a sequel.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game!!!! I play it almost all the time. It's really addicting and is a great way to pass the time if you're waiting for something because you can always go back to the place you left off. I also like that you can replay any level. It's really fun, and I would recommend it to anyone.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|Wow. Bad. Really bad. This seemed like a last ditch effort to sell something prior to retirement. I enjoyed the Alien series when I was younger, but this. I am so glad I didn't go to the theater for this one. Predictable.

B002ZG98C8|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in years and years. Maybe since Airplane when I was in like the 8th grade. This is old school, side splitting funny, especially the stunt with the chopper at the end.In a boring world full of one garbage movie after another, this was a joy and pleasure.I've been feeling quite wound up over watching Mitt Romney lie the past few weeks, this movie really relaxed me.I feel great!

B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Costume was pretty great! I got it for my 9 year old son extra small size. Still pretty big for him he is 4'6 but it was a must have for Halloween this year. He can grow into it and use it for later fun as well. The graphics are cool on it too, the helmet comes in two piece and is held together with little circle Velcro strips . If your not willing to make a few altercation then it would probably make u frustrated. I have it 4 stars because of the price , think I should be lowered or offer a kid sizes for a cheaper price.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I was very disappointed in book number 2. I hope the third installment wraps up this story. I wish EVA would leave him alreadly.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|A confusing mess of boreing high tech drivel. There should have more connection to the following films.It was too dark visualy.We watch it in 3-d which made it bearable. Ridley Scott can do better.Amazon sent the film in a flash.

B005LAIHPY|5.0|This is a great movie, after so many negative reviews I was skeptical about purchasing it, I am glad I did not pay attention to the critics because we enjoyed the movie.
B005S9ELM6|3.0|This was an entertaining movie but if this is the Academy Award film it is being advertised as, then the standard for an Academy Award has declined to a record low.  The only two characters that add interest to this series of cardboard characters are John Houseman and Alan Arkin who have very little screen time.  Overall none of the characters are developed to the point that you know anything about them or even particularly care about them.  There are lots of evil looking Iranians chanting in Farsi and looking like refugees from the Cuban Revolution, but none of them are developed as characters.  There is some effort to develop Menzies as a character but why he and his wife are separated is not addressed.  None of the CIA people seem to have names much less any depth as characters.  Lots of action and some tense moments give the movie enough interest to sit through but there isn't much else here.  The screen play may follow the actual events but it is not an academy award effort.  The costumes follow the styles of the time, but give the characters a sort of comic effect.  I remember the actual event and the anger that the President failed to do anything.  This was completely ignored in the movie and I think Jimmy Carter was mentioned only once with no reference at all to his reaction. Overall a rather pedestrian effort and not nearly as interesting as any one of Bruce Willis's adventures.

B005LAIIPS|5.0|I thought this one was fantastic. Great acting, great story, great plot, and great fight scenes. I did not notice the absence of Matt Daemon, but it would be nice to get him back in another one. However I think the new actor fit the role perfectly, and he was certainly a better fit here than he was in Mission Impossible III, and the Avengers.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is awesome. I am really enjoying playing it. I just don't want to put my kindle down. I should highly recommend this game.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|If this game didn't lag, this would be 5 stars. Also, the characters are really overpriced, cause they want you to buy coins.  Other than those two things, 5 stars
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|For the money this is a great game! Great mystery and storyline. The object find games mixed in is added fun. Can't wait to start on the Enigmatis 2 game!
B008MEM24S|3.0|it's cool to see an app about Perry the platupus.(p.s phienus and ferb is a great show.) 1,234,567,891 that's. my rateing for this app.
B002ISID10|5.0|I absolutely love this CD. The price was great and the quality was good even though I bought it used. Asking Alexandria is amazing.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|The movie was visually enjoyable the acting wasn't horrible the story was pretty weak. It's certainly not going to be discussed years from now as a great movie of the past, but I wasn't bored and didn't feel like I had wasted two hours of my life so I guess overal I enjoyed it
B008MM9630|5.0|i think its great fun magical cool amazing  sweet perfect for my taste love it hits me with cool me
B008XNZMOU|5.0|This is worth the money!<br />Taylors swift new album red is the best record so far. You will enjoy listening to this album.<br />I had no doubt in my mind that it would be a disapointment and it wasnt.<br />This is by so far the best thing i hav bpught on amazon.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just finished a marathon first reading of this extraordinary book.  Regardl, less of genre this is one of the best books I have ever read.  I will certainly go back to various sections repeatedly.  The character development is only topped by the amazing and highly believable creativity.  The really scary part - it is certainly possible even probable.
1609611543|5.0|A very informative book, I would recommend it to everyone.  I have loaned the book to my friends, may have to order another one for myself.  This book has helped me lose weight and feel better, I can attest it is true.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|a very helpful and useful app. plus it is free. you cannot go wrong with that. i would recommend it. you will be happy you did.
B00846REIS|5.0|This is a 3 series book just like fifty shades but 100 times better!!  Better story better characters I cant wait for the third book to come out in May.  If you liked fifty shades you will love bared to you.
0553386697|5.0|must read by all parents. It will make your kids and your life much easer. For those who struggle with tantrums  or emotional situations where they feel helpless.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is awesome to me I give it a 6. beacause.  I play when I'm bored. when bord and I start playing and I'm happy
B00846REIS|5.0|I had a great time reading this book. Lotsa steamy hot sex scenes and a story that leaves you begging for more!
B008D36INE|4.0|The movie is a great representation of the battle we fight between a stable relationship and the passion that comes from something forbidden.  Although it felt like there were steps missing, the actors all portrayed their characters quite well.  The focus is on the woman and seems to be \\"told\\" from her perspective.  It's sad because the truth of the film hits quite close to home.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|Very disappointing. I expected either humor or horror and it was neither. Johnny Depp was the only minor interesting character. Save your money and rent something else!
B004Q7CIFI|2.0|Deeply disappointed. This turns out to be a love story, rather than any satisfying thoughtful change of the past. Maybe a twist will come at the end (70% done) but it has been diffucult to slog through to this point just for the ending.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I don't understand the need for the HUGE list of permissions. Why does this game need a list of all the accounts on my device along with all the other intrusive permissions for me to play? I just don't get it, so I just won't get the game.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I am happy with this app. it saves notes and has an easy to use interface. I was a little conceded with some BigBrother type issues in the permissions, but I haven't had any issues. would recommend
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Haunting music...  visually mesmerizing!  This adaptation left me with empathy for both suitors.  Clearly Christine felt those same emotions and was torn as well as deeply saddened for the Phantom's fate.
B0084IG8TM|3.0|Considering the fact that I watch a lot of crime movies and I am completely obsessed with Law and Order Svu I was suprised and how much the violence in this movie bothered me. Yes I understand that in the ratings it does that it is violent and that it contains disturbing images however I never thought in a million years I would be witnessing a scene in which a bunch of young teens would be taking their knives out and slashing eachother to death just to survive in this game. I guess its my own fault for watching the movie and not reading the book first however I believe that it should be rated R. That image will forever be in my mind. I wanted to literally run out of the theatre and never go back because I found that scene so stomach turning and awful. I understand that the point of the movie is to show what a horrible game these poor kids are forced to play are but still did we really need a scene that graphic. Now let me clarify again that I am not one who gets queezy over violence easily, I have scene Scream, Halloween and many other horrifically violent movies but somehow this one disturbed me. I really give it up for the people who made this movie possible because such a scene like that left an impact on me and probably other people and really made us see the horrible society these people are in. I really do believe that this is a great movie just too violent for me though. I may consider seeing the second one when it comes out because I hear its less violent. So even though I didnt like the violence I am giving this movie a rating of three stars because they really did a good job at creating an impact on the audience.
1423140605|5.0|Pre-ordering was AMAZING through Amazon. You do get a REFUND. You also get FAST shipping!<br />I already checked out how much it was in stores and I got it CHEAP with pre-ordering, I love it.<br />(There are spoilers, so don't read beyond this if you haven't read it yet!)<br /><br />I loved Mark of Athena. I thought it was high time that Annabeth finally had the spotlight on her without talking about Luke or Thalia. But I found the relationship between Annabeth and Percy, fringing on around its edges. I think Jason and Piper were the \\"front\\" couple of the entire adventure. I liked that they traveled to different states and had key events happening in every one of them. Especially the adventure to Georgia, that was interesting.<br /><br />For Leo, I'm happy he got over his \\"I'm too complicated for organic life-forms\\" like his godly father. I've gotten over \\"Oh, I'm a mechanic, I'm not human\\" just because they only know about fixing mechanics and cannot fix a human. Everyone has issues in trying to please a person or trying to fix a problem and centering that kind of issue around mechanics kind of got overdone. But anyway, I'm glad Leo got more action in the series through Mark of Athena. Although, I wish he would've joked less when it revolved around Hazel because that brought on random fights between him and Frank. But I was surprised to find out that Hazel's \\"Sammy\\" is Leo's grandfather. Which finally made Frank shut-the-fruit-up and I was glad it did. I even laughed a little when I found out because I guessed as much that he was related to \\"Sammy\\" when Hazel said he looked like him from the hologram he sent to clarify the Greeks were \\"Coming in Peace\\" into the Roman camp.<br /><br />For Jason, it really annoyed me that he kept getting hit over the head and knocked out constantly. He was basically no better than the Satyrs that seem to be useless (other than Grover who learned to finally use \\"Panic\\" and became the Lord of the Wild). But I guess it was good to showthat even a POPULAR son that strictly loves going \\"by the rules\\" get beaten up.<br /><br />For Piper, I don't think she hardly had anything to do with the book this time... other than tending to her boyfriend. Although, in the beginning of the book, Annabeth does describe the way she looks and whatever. Her charm-speak also counted for nothing except when she was speaking to the Romans when they were entering the Roman Camp.<br /><br />For Coach Hedge, he was basically useless. I suppose it was good that Percy, Annabeth, Leo, Hazel, Frank, Piper and Jason had a chaperone? Though that made whatever short romantic scenes kind of lack luster.<br /><br />For Percy, I was glad he came back! His transition in returning to his friends was a bit... stiff? Though, I do applaud Annabeth flipping Percy on his back out of anger, that was uncalled for but a little funny. And I do understand why Annabeth was insecure when she met up with Percy because he's always the \\"good guy\\" and a lot of girls fall for that--especially since in the last book, Reyna hinted that she wanted to lay her unrequited feelings she had for Jason onto Percy.<br /><br />For Hazel, I think I started to have a metallic taste for her character as she went head over heels for Leo. I also think that it was annoying the way the author kept making her assume that he was \\"Sammy\\" from her past and not take in reality of the situation. But then again, I guess girls cause problems sometimes.<br /><br />For Frank, he got annoying when he kept abusing Leo. Especially since he regarded him as \\"Sammy\\" because he looks like him. Guys can be territorial with their girlfriends or girls that they like, I know this. It happened between Annabeth, Rachel, Calypso and Percy in the earlier series of the Olympians. But I was glad that he became more confident and took his secret gift in stride and used it a lot more in this book. In addition, I'm glad that he was fearful of Leo being a fire-user, that put the nip in the bud!<br /><br />For Reyna, I will say she's okay now since she held off Octavian from sending war troops after Jason, Percy, Hazel, Piper, Annabeth, Leo, and Frank. But why make her such a weak ruler? Her sister even came there for her with the Amazons--shouldn't that have given her enough support without Percy being there? Oh well.<br /><br />For Nemesis... fortune cookies, really? That's her big come back in revenge? I found it a bit rustically comical. She acted like a little kid. It's true that no one always has \\"good luck\\" and I guess there has to be a balance between good and bad luck as well. Although, I found her uninteresting. Especially when she sent Hazel and Leo to go do a mini quest and save a boy who was narcissistic. Honestly, I thought it wasn't worth it.<br /><br />For the Monsters, I was glad that they added more difficult monsters in their journey to Rome. Though, I found it a bit stupid that the author made Percy mull over some mermaid fish/piranha people? Didn't want to meet him or whatever. Their appearance didn't really last long anyway, especially since they were only used to announce that Percy, Leo, Jason and Hazel were trespassing and that they'd help in the war in their own way to take down that Zoo where monsters were being domesticated for side-shows back in Georgia. But the spirit possessions were overrated, I figured it was going to come into play because of the previous brain-washings that happened with Kronos in the Olympian series.<br /><br />For Mr. \\"D\\", I was glad that he came back into play... but I don't think I like his Roman side much--I know there's not much of a difference but at least the Greek Mr. \\"D\\" had more spunk and didn't act so... I guess I would say, human? I didn't really feel it was Mr. \\"D\\" until he lazily didn't help Percy and the others when they were fighting those twin monsters in Rome, during their circus preparations.<br /><br />For Nico, I thought it was cute that they referred to him as an \\"Angel\\" in the new Prophecy/Mission since it's a part of his name. Above all, he was very smart to eat the seeds (I forget what they're called), to sustain his life source and energy. But I felt really fed up with how Nico keeps getting abused and thrown around. Ever since the author made Nico bring Percy down to his father Hades, he's been mistreated. Even more so when Percy found out that Nico knew that Percy and Jason had been exchanged to the two camps--Greek and Roman. Percy, more than anyone, even if he's a rule breaker, should know that you cannot mess with fate. Especially not with Juno/Hera, she always causes misfortune upon everyone.<br /><br />For Athena, I found it a bit funny when they finally made her appear as a bum? Searching for her child to seek the mark of Athena since the Romans stole her statue of power and disregarded her as a useless God and only good at \\"Crafts.\\"<br /><br />For everything else, I liked it and I didn't like it. I actually now want to read the next book already since I feel a bit disappointed.<br /><br />*EDIT* 11/1/2012<br />FOR THOSE who want this book, it is cheaper to buy it on here on Amazon still.<br />It's going for $14 or more in stores and probably more everywhere else. So, this is a good buy.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this app it is hours of fun and I luv sending my nghbrs gifts and I get gifts back too!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is a very cool game.  Lots of fun games to play.  My favorite game is darts.  highly recommend for anyone who wants a variety of games in one.
B003CH9PTU|5.0|For frequent flyers, Breaking Bad is an ideal airplane video series. I fly a lot ... watching TV series in the long sittings are ideal time killers.<br /><br />The Breaking Bad premise is `geek meets mortality'. For the time remaining in this world, the dying geek's choices are fundamentally defective. His choices break worse and consume all around him. Thin is the line between good, bad, and well intentioned.<br /><br />The show is slow by episode. The series can be enjoyed in the full season viewing.
B003B5M0PO|5.0|I read it in a weekend. Enjoyed every word. So well written, I felt as though I knew each character personally.  Amazing book; will look for more by the same author now :-)
B0091REZMW|4.0|5 stars would be given but cant link to my current FB game. would be great if I could transfer coins between them and would up to a 5 star rating.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|It comes at no surprise that Mumford and Sons has released another amazing album. Every song of theirs is outstanding. I would recommend this album to anyone.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great story. I thought it got better each chapter. After reading this book, I'm looking forward to seeing the movie as well as reading the other books in this series.
0857680986|4.0|Another great selection that was added to my library of art books. At 70 years plus, I'm still going to school to increase my knowledge.<br />This book has helped me in my figure drawing class which in turn is helping me prepare for my next semesters class on sculpting the<br />human figure in clay.<br /><br />Great reference book and well worth the price.
1416549447|5.0|Very well written. Very sound and helpful instruction on how we are supposed to run, but \\"forgot\\"...  This is a good read for any beginner, or veteran runner.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I didn‘t know what the story line was when I started. I was very surprised to find a love story intertwined. Looking forward to book two.
0525953728|5.0|I am far from a SEAL expert, but I have read quite a few books written by other SEALs.  I'm still trying to figure out exactly what the Pentagon felt was classified in this book that hasn't been in other \\"approved\\" books.  IMHO the administraiton (Obama) is upset because this book shows Osama for the coward he was and it goes against the administration version of the way he died.
1476712042|5.0|When I picked up this book in the romance section of Barnes and Nobles, I was expecting the same as every other romance novel. The characters are attracted, don't exactly want to be involved with one another, but end up being perfect for one another. This book goes much deeper than the simple love stories I have read in the past.<br /><br />I was so intrigued with how deeply Abby and Travis's emotional connection ran, that I read the book in a few hours. I am absolutely fascinated with their co-dependency, their faults, and that the author was able to make me feel such raw emotions for these characters. I didn't want the book to finish.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I really tried hard not to compare this book to the H. P. series ( which I thought was fantastic and superbly well written). This book was a let down. I really wanted to like this book however,  I found the characters somewhat difficult to follow, the storyline rather choppy and slow and the ending disappointing.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The ups and downs of the life and relationship of Gideon and Eva will make you not want to put this book down!  I couldn't stop reading in the two nights it took me to read this book.  I leave you with this thought...: Everyone needs a Gideon.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|My wife and I didn't know what to expect from Moonrise Kingdom, which we rented Instant Video the other night. She hadn't heard of it and I didn't really have a good idea of what to expect. We were actually searching for another film that featured Tilda Swinton, who plays a frosty villain in this piece, and decided to give it a go.<br /><br />Moonrise Kingdom is lyrical, filmed in a lush, color-soaked style and steeped in a kind of faux Norman Rockwellian nostalgia for it's 1960's setting. It is a vision of a bucolic America that never existed, populated with famous actors, male and female.<br /><br />A word of warning: this is not a children's film, per se, even though it is about children and is told in a fabulist style that hews close to Walt Disney. This film features themes such as adultery, sexual awakening, loss, the nature of family, and so forth neatly interwoven into its innocuous and breathtaking landscapes. It's not as hard-edged or crude as, say, Blue Velvet, but it's mighty subversive. Think \\"Benicio del Toro directing your kindergarten Christmas play with visuals from Terence Malick\\"?<br /><br />It is also deadpan hilarious. I laughed. A lot. Check it out.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was such and enchanting book, and it really captured the whole teenage anxiety period. And my new favorate word is IFINITY!!
B008ANFRGQ|5.0|Before you critique this listen to it at least several times (5+). It took me several to \\"get it\\". Steve Vai is way ahead of his time. Like Jimi was in his day, Vai's  music is not the most accessible at times. But it is brilliant. Complex compositions, great production, and insane musicianship. Standout tracks include: Velorum, Gravity Storm, Weeping China Doll and Creamsicle Sunset. The \\"Story of Light\\" is light years ahead of it's time. Give it a chance.
B008XCPO2Q|2.0|So disappointed with this version of the movie.  Love the movie (it's Channing Tatum, who wouldn't!?!?).  And yes, the title does say movie only, but the product details say:<br /><br />Special Features<br />- Deleted Dance Scenes<br />- Backstage On Magic Mike<br />- The Moves of Magic Mike<br /><br />THESE ARE NOT INCLUDED ON THIS DISK. I am so disappointed that I am going to research if I can return on opened DVD .... I didn't realize until I started watching it that the only \\"extra\\" included was the interviews \\"backstage\\", no deleted dance scenes.  :O(
B000FC1AGG|3.0|I found it to be good but not great. The good part was that it didn't over dramatize anything and moved along at a swift pace and Emma's parents found our the truth about her cousin. Of course the ending turned out good too. The bad part was that it was really pretty predictable with the room mates . One is always a bitch, one is always very nice and the other fixes  their problems.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I loved this book.  I found it really helpful for me to understand myself and my husband.  Once I started reading the book I immediately recognized my husbands love language.  It took a little longer for me to learn what mine was.  I now understand both of us better!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|great and very fun game!!!! this is a great game for any ages!!!! you should buy this app. have a great time!!!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|The extended opening and ending make this disc worth the buy. Ridley Scott has made a great prequel to the Alien trilogy and the ending leaves little doubt that a followup film is in the making.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|The movie is fantastic especially in Blu ray. Action scenes are amazing and the quality is perfect! Highly recommended! Great movie for your collection.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|The ghosts of maple creek is a fun game to play and real engaging to the whole family.<br />the game will keep you guessing to the end.
B008RV5K5E|1.0|This movie is animated, it was definitely not what we were ordering. Looking at the featured ad, what you can't see because it is unreadable is that this choice is the ANIMATED version, this is in very small print on top the the word BATMAN. When we ordered this we thought it was the original movie version.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app. I use it for work and personal items. I highly recommend this app for every one.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is so awesome. Usually I don't like games that take a long time to finish but this one you have to get!!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very entertaining. Dramatic. Action packed. Suspenseful. An underlying love story. Happy but sad ending. Well written series. Good for teenagers and adults.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I liked the trailer, I liked the entire movie. I am not one to watch a movie more than one time, but I would watch this one again.
B0086700CM|5.0|fast way to spend 5 minutes without feeling guiltybabout having wasted your youth and education.  I especially like the ape chase that really does nothing but make you nervous.
B003EYVXVY|1.0|Biggest scam around so please do not waste your money on it. In the latest Avatar (crappy theatrical version - no extended version) 3D the size of the 3D movie (on the disc) is only 13 GB, whereas the 2d version is 32 GB, data transfer rate while watching the crappy 3D version is only 7 to 12 MB/second! That is as bad as a DVD which is about 7 MB/second. James Cameron's movies are always the biggest rip-offs around, took like 20 years before a proper release of Titanic was released! Now the same with Avatar, the crooks behind him like to have you buy like 5 different versions before you get a proper release. So avoid this, I got it as a gift so it wasn't too bad for me.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|No instructions for these games so us old farts cant figure out how to.play half of them.  Having only a limited number of them to play until you \\"earn\\" the right to play more is a bit chintzy too.  Not worth taking up space to keep it.
B009GENZKS|3.0|I liked a lot the look of this movie, very hyper realistic  CGI , lots of action and a resident evil set, the problems with the movie is the flat script and dialog, it looks fantastic but doesnt feel human, it feels more like a video game than a real movie, lacks a good plot well developed,  one to rent
B0063IH60K|3.0|Typical solitare- cant make it exciting but fun to fill time at Dr office and such.  Responsive and allows a bit of customization which is nice.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this app!!! Its like temple run but even better you don't have to tilt your device. If you want an app to make your time go away I would get this app!!! Best app ever!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have been waiting for this app for like forever on th kindle fire! Now that it is finally here I don't have to play it on my daddy's ipad anymore! SO HAPPY!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It is nice to have a game like bejeweled with a little more of a story and some nice twists.
1934429376|4.0|Thank You! SUuper! Book very nice! Bad packaging, and damaged cover!!! drawback ( . Printing is a bit weak. But on the whole pleasant experience from the book.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Bought the book after watching the movie which followed the book nicely. Definitely worth reading. I'll move on to book 2 soon
B009SSGBOE|4.0|Fagan simply delivers. His style is unique. He is a weaver of story and tune, and NYC style.<br />Love it.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I love me some Gideon Cross. These books thus far are far more than I ever anticipated them to be. The world in which these two live in, amazes me ever time unread one if these books. His controlling and animalistic needs are ones that I would be willing to meet. The all out pure passion and primal need for each other is all consuming. A far reach from what people say is close to Fifty Shades. I believe this book to be nothing close to that. This story holds its own, in a story that will leave you panting for more. Hats off to Sylvia Day! You will be left breathless and yearning for more Gideon:)
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Excellent, fun movie. Great speacial & sound effects. So many different directions to go with the next chapter. Possible prequel to Alien ???
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is simply a great app.  Very easy to use and turns the full screen into a calculator.  Classic ten key data entry for fast entry._
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Very much worth every penny. It ranks as the best super hero movie iv seen in awhile. The combo pack itself is great 3d bluray, bluray, dvd, digital copy, and the full digital soundtrack. Note it also comes with access to a free poster which is not free because I had to pay shipping and handling. One more thing it comes with a digital comic book as well but you have to sign up at marvel it does not cost anything to sign up. Hope this helps:-)
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|I liked Stargate SG-1, but Universe took itself a bit more seriously (like Battlestar Galactica), which I really loved.  Dr. Rush and Eli were great characters, and I enjoyed watching both of them grow into deeper humans as a result of their trials and tribulations.  However, like all good and thought-provoking shows, this one was cancelled before I had grown tired of it.  Just like Firefly, or Jericho....  Glad we still are slogging though yet another crappy season of Grey's Anatomy.  Wish the world had better taste.
1423140605|5.0|Let me qualify this review by saying I am an older, seasoned reader of youth literature and a certifiable Rick Riordan fan! I enjoy his writing style; moreover, I am grateful for his fast-paced, researched-based storylines that capture a reader's imagination regardless of age. I have been reading Riordan since my oldest grandson introduced me to Percy Jackson and The Lightning Thief.<br /><br />That being said, I just finished The Mark of Athena today and can say that I was not disappointed. Riordan pens an information-packed action story that picks up where Son of Neptune leaves off. His use of geography, mythology, and history makes for a fun, if not educational, read. The character interactions stay true to previous plotlines. While this installment focuses on \\"Annabeth's quest within the Prophecy Quest\\", each of the 7 demigods take center-stage at strategic moments, simultaneously exposing their most inner fears and earning the respect of their teammates. The vulnerability of our heroes makes The Mark of Athena a captivating read.<br /><br />Consider yourselves warned: you might become so engrossed in the book that you fail to notice the extensive glossary in the back and mistake those pages for \\"more story to come!\\" Fall 2013 cannot come too soon.
B000W93CHC|5.0|While I like a lot of Follett's work, I think this is my favorite.  He went in a different direction when he tackled the 1300s, and I thought he did a masterful job.  My only occasional complaint is that he does not write women as well as, well, a woman might, but I still loved the book.  I generally prefer science fiction, but this was just such a great story, it remains a favorite.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|Since it is almost Halloween I was really hoping for a good horror movie. I was very disappointed. The movie just doesn't work. The vampires are OK but I guess I am used to \\"The Walking Dead\\" zombies to be scared. I dozed off several times and never watched the ending. I can not recommend this movie at all.
0385535147|4.0|Vintage Grisham! Thrill, intrigue, fun, serious, deceit, revenge- everything one used to find when Grisham used to be at his peak (Firm, Time to Kill, Pelican Brief, Runaway Jury....). First half of the book deals with the central character, Mal Bannister, trying to buy his freedom from jail by becoming an informant about the identity of the killer of a judge. The second half of the book departs almost completely from that, and narrates Bannister's dealings with an ex-con who until then does not even find a mention in the book. Both these seemingly dis-jointed plots converge brilliantly towards the end, merging to give a coherent end to the novel.<br /><br />The hallmark of Grisham's thrillers used to be a central character almost superhuman in nature. In all the novels I named above, the central characters eventually turn out as winners (in a relative sense), and the stories end on a high/happy note. Grisham's story telling during the middle of his career became too serious and skirting on realism, which by itself does not make them bad though the fun was missing. But there seems to be a gradual trend of readers getting restored to the earlier craft that made Grisham what he is (the Litigators, for instance, which while being serious and real, was also fun- in a fiction thriller sense). This novel is exactly that- amidst the seriousness of issues like wastage of tax-payers monies on the prison system, prisons mostly failing in their main aim of reforming a convict, corruption, etc., the overall flow and tenor of the story is to be an entertaining, make-believe, and somewhat unreal and exaggerated fiction.<br /><br />The only reason I am not giving it the full 5 stars is because judged in the context of a master-craftsman like Grisham, the novel is 50 pages too long, and slightly heavy on fine-details that were avoidable. But overall, fantastic and highly recommended. Do not miss!
B0082RHRHC|4.0|Not being a very avid reader of the classics I was quite surprised at the relevance of the story to the fiction of today, but masterfully written! As a 28 year old guy I'm not usually accustomed to picking something like this up, but at the encouragement of my wife and the audio book available I was welcome to the opportunity of reading/ listening to it. All in all I loved the book and would recommend it to anyone looking to expand their language and or their list of great books to read.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I tried another PDF reader app before settling on the gold standard.  The other reader spit up on a copy of the IRS publication 17.  Granted, it's a couple of hundred pages long, but you don't have to render all the pages of the document all at the same time!  This wasn't a problem for the Acrobat Reader.  Since PDF and Acrobat Reader are near synonyms, and it's FREE how can you lose?
B000FCK8ZK|3.0|The story was exciting to read and I couldn't put the book down, however I felt the writing could have been a little better. It's not poorly written, just not a masterpiece either.<br /><br />I'd still recommend this book to anyone (especially fans of the Showtime series) because it's quick read.
B005R32L66|5.0|My little 7\\" tablet can do video conferencing thanks to Skype.....  Friends that I hadn't seen in decades are right there before my eyes.  The amazing thing is that the tablet I'm using has a single core CPU, and cost me less than $70 ( new, before taxes ).  The installation went without a hitch, and the loop test was a comfort to say all was working well.  I hooked up with my buddies, and even on a relatively slow DSL connection, streamed video and talk in both directions without a lot of buffering or delay.  This service is easy to use and worth the subscription fee for sure!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book grabs your interest from the start! Very good!  The characters are interesting. I like how they are connected and how this causes conflicts in mind and the game they need to win.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|There are so many different types of workouts out there. High or low reps? Confuse your muscles to get ripped? I admit it; I have no clue what works and what doesn't. All I know is I was busting my butt doing high reps and feeling like the weakest guy in the gym.<br /><br />I am early into the BLS workout routine. But if I could describe it using one phrase, it would be this: confidence inspiring. Fewer reps allows me to lift heavier weight and feel like I actually have some strength to me. And after just a few weeks, I'm lifting as much as I did when I was 22. More importantly, my strength has increased each week in every lift. I find myself disliking my two days off per week from lifting.<br /><br />The book is not just a workout fad. It's realistic. It tells you in a very straight forward way the one thing we don't want to acknowledge; you have to eat right to get results. And it explains to us when you need to eat certain foods and why. I've heard no carbs after dinner for a long time now. But until I read this book, I had no idea why. And what about protein? Fast digesting vs. slow digesting and the importance of each. I feel like a fool for listening to countless idiots at GNC instructing me to overload protein to a point that did me no good.<br /><br />I believe the most important aspect of BLS is that everything presented to us is realistically attainable. In just about every way, shape and form, I am an average Joe seeking to improve my physical health and appearance. My confidence would have been shaken and maybe even shattered if I read a book that threw me into diificult lifts like hang cleans or a ridiculous amount of reps that can only be performed by world class athletes. The exercises and workouts presented in BLS can be done by anyone. The diet plan can be followed by anyone. It doesn't involve several hours out of your day in the gym or living in misery during every meal. It just takes dedication and desire.<br /><br />Big props to Mr. Matthews. Heclearly lives and breathes BLS. His passion and dedication to health and fitness and helping others is incredibly inspiring. He's not a corporate guy interested in making a buck. Not only did he follow me back on Twitter right away. He even replied to a personal messsage that I sent him almost immediately. How many people that have written books would actually do that in this day in age?<br /><br />I have a long way to go in my health quest. But I am looking forward to the journey and following the BLS plan presented to me. I am already completely committed to it and it didn't even get close to breaking my bank to get there. I appreciate all of the thorough details and consideration Mr. Matthews used in every aspect of this book.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|I'm an avenger fan so I was going to buy a copy of this at some point. The price was hard to beat. The only thing I was not happy with was the digital copy. I have a high resolution monitor and SD just does not cut it. I could understand included the SD copy for iTunes if you just bought the DVD but with the blue ray should be the HD version.
B000EWBNMS|5.0|It has been cut and I think that is a very big error.  In the live series Allison drank A LOT.  In fact, she drank a large glass of vodka every night to try and keep her asleep and the dreams away and drank lightly all day.  By season TWO that was gone and there was no further mention of it.  There are now only references to when she drank, which make no sense in the absence of her drinking.<br /><br />I assume the people responsible for the release on DVD and the quick change when it ran, decided that to show it would turn all who watched it in to crazed alcoholics.  The responsible and REAL thing to do would have been to show her make a decision that alcohol was not the best way to deal with her situation and even go though withdrawal if she drank a year or more.  But now, everyone you are meant to like on TV and Movies must be flawless paragons of virtue.  Not real people.<br /><br />The decision to make Allison less than human hurts the character in my view.<br /><br />The same applies to the very last show in the series.  Tons of watchers were irate when the program did show real life.  The moral, you can't please most people any time.  If it does not conform to their world view, challenges them or makes them think this show would have never lasted.  After it cut the reality of the first season and there was no more till the very last show, and then 99% of the viewers HATED the last show, because it was once again REAL.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|This book was picked by the book club I belong to.  It was to be a read for the \\"Halloween Season\\".  Found the first half of the book entertaining....then became bored and found it hard to complete.
B008XX6J92|5.0|This is a fantastic journey with Streisand through decades of artistry.  The most astonishing thing is that she sounds as if time and age never affected her ability and artistry.  As promised in the liner notes there is a second volume coming soon and I can't wait for it!
B008Y2IU12|4.0|Redeemed my digital copy so I didn't actually purchase anything. Works great and is a pretty good movie. The only negative would be having all these separate players for the digital copies but can't fault Amazon for that.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|addicting cannot stop playing wish coins added quicker lots of fun love the puzzle pieces some are harder than others to move
B009NQKPUW|4.0|The movie its nice but it fails way too short of the standards imposed out there by previous movies (e.g. Avatar, Lord of the Rings). Its plot is based on an idea that is not elaborated enough and has no conclusion, clearly aimed for a sequel.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am somewhat of a Solitaire fiend, so this was the first app I downloaded on my Kindle Fire. I can't stop playing it!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I installed Kindel for Android on a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1.  I found that it is as intuitive and easy to use and the Kindle Reader I have.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Great case. Looks great, love it. We looked at different cases but this case was by far the best looking case in its price range.
B008FTAAG2|4.0|It was a good album, just not their best offering to this date.. They do sound alot better so the production team has stepped up for these guys at least....the song Blood is over done, and doesnt showcase her full tlalent and voice, it relies too much on overdubbs and machines...... all in all it is worth purchasing as there is good stuff o it, just not their best work in my opinion....
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|Compared to her last album, this leans more on the folkpop side. If not a little darker in a couple of songs too. But it's the same amount of quality that she delivers. She's one of my favorite musicians and I am once again impressed.
B000091NGU|4.0|The recording was, as I expected, a carefully used vinyl Lp record which satisfied my needs and was as described in the website. It saved me time and money so I am completely satisfied with the purchase.
B008K7RGA2|5.0|I am writing this as I am watching it on the U-Tube in full, HD, etc. To keep things short, this production is a masterpiece.<br />Why a masterpiece is available to everybody for free? For this very reason. Masterpieces do not belong to anybody; they belong to everyone.<br />No need to go into details of who did what and who sang how.<br />Vocally, artistically, musically, visually, etc., I see nothing comparable to this Tosca anywhere in the Internet space.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was such a good read!  The only negative I could find was how did the character know about swimming.  I love science fiction, what a stretch of the imagination, and this book certainly fit the bill.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|This book has the pacing, tension, darkness, goodness, violence, and charicterizations that you would expect from a Harry Hole novel by Jo Nesbo. I enjoyed the journey very much and would recommend it to previous readers of this genre.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|My only complaint was how it ended to soon and that I have to wait so long until the next book comes out.
B006RED4GA|3.0|I really loved most of this movie--an old, eerie hotel with a past and two employees left alone all night, etc., etc. I loved the \\"old school spookiness\\" and that it did not rely on cheesey CGI or super-gore for a scare. But the \\"mystery\\" made completely no sense at all and when it was over, I said, \\"THAT'S IT??? What's the point?\\" There's no resolution to the mystery at which really about ticks a viewer off. I \\"supposed\\" (since nothing in the movie indicates for sure) the old man at the end of the movie may have been the ghost's husband or to-be husband or whatever ... but that would be impossible unless the old man was over 100 years old ... so WHO WAS HE??? What?? The ending made no sense and your left just really feeling let down. It was really a great \\"old-fashioned\\" spooky movie up until the end. In short--good spook movie but the ending made me feel ripped off.
B008AX18Y6|3.0|Amazingly written, typical of Rushdie but I do not buy his story. He was upto michief when he wrote the Satanic Verses! In this book, he comes across like a child  (Calvin, maybe) who has been caught after a nasty and elaborately planned prank which injures others and then conjures up stories which try to justify his prank. Why do such geniuses have to be so perverted ?
B003VPWXRO|5.0|I love to read memoirs and really appreciate when the author/story teller can take you to a moment and hold you their so that your 5 senses are alive within that moment. Reading Unbearable Lightness, was to see, hear, touch, taste and feel what Portia de Rossi was living in those moments she recounted in this book. I could feel her pain, her triumphs, her giddiness, her despair. It was almost as though I lived those moments she recounted with her. A well written memoir that is at different times exhilarating and painful to read. But it is a must read.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I highly recommend this youtube download app. No glitches whatsoever. All of the other ones I tried would develope problems after using them 3 or 4 times.
B008FOB124|2.0|I know what you wanted. You wanted it to be 1994 again. So do I. So do most of us. You want to sit with your headphones on and your mostly decriminalized hindu kush and you want to ride the slipstream of Sanvean and listen to Lisa Gerrard warbling at her personal \\"Hounds of Love\\" level pinnacle. We all want that. But it's just not possible.<br /><br />People get older. The neck you had in 1996 is not the neck you have now. The plural larynges you had in 1987 are not the ones you have now.<br /><br />The DCD you had in 1996 is not the one you're going to get now.<br /><br />I know, it's a bummer. You can't get these annoying young hipsters with their vastly inferior music (and their vastly superior trees) to sit through \\"AION\\" no matter how deep they are rollin'.<br /><br />And this record isn't going to help your cause. They'll just toss you a burned copy of \\"Niki and the Dove\\" and tell you to go mold away in the corner.<br /><br />So what. If you like DCD, and you have mellowed a little bit, then it's fine.<br /><br />If your mom or dad is trying to get you to \\"show some respect\\" for this band, you'll probably laugh your two dollar glasses off.<br /><br />Still, it's ok. Dead Can Dance, and old people can have their trip music.<br /><br />Oh - and don't bother trying to pocket yer dad's stash - it's crap. Just like this record.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|As always mitch albom nailed this story. A deep and meaningful plot, rich characters, beautiful use of every word. There is something brilliant in how mitch links characters and creates entertainment with a deep message.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is great. love the zombie theme and the game plays great on kindle fire. would definitely recommend to my friends.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|Again, Shinedown is awesome! This album is destined to be platinum. If you like even one song by Shinedown from the past, BUY THIS ALBUM!!! It is great. My favorite song is I'll Follow You. It's about best friends and all you'd do for them. Like I said, though, not a single bad song! Can't wait for another USA tour in 2013. :-)<br /><br />-ShinedownAddict (Twitter ID)
B0058VW36U|4.0|Installed this on my Kindle for the grandkids to play.  They absolutely loved it!  Even the grownups got addicted to it once they started playing it.
1402793375|5.0|To all those who are in doubt about this type of book, you must read it to understand it. As a historian myself who was raised and educated with the other side of the story (i.e. the Native Americans), it is very easy to see how this book could be degraded as much as it is. This is one of the most thorough books that I have encountered and I have read a lot of books that are supposedly \\"Native American\\" based, but aren't. This is a truly inspiring book and I am planning on making it part of my university college class that I teach on the Native Americans.
B0027UY8B8|5.0|Has the original miniseries, and all the seasons, as well as Razor.  Does *NOT* include \\"The Plan\\".<br />Well packaged, all discs in standard plastic DVD cases so no cardboard junk here.  Quality is outstanding, and the video is just gorgeous.<br />I grew up with the original BSG and I absolutely loved the reimaging of it that was done, liked it much better than the original.  I was one of the people who felt the ending was a bit of a copout, just writers who seemed to get lazy and didn't want to have to come up with something real, but fortunately it does't detract from the entire series.  First two seasons were still my favorite, third was kind of slow and not as enjoyable for me, but they picked up again in season 4 until the very very end where they just blew it.<br /><br />But still a great series, and this is the best price I've found for the entire series on blu-ray.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I am a huge fan and I could not wait for their new album to come out.  They changed a few of the arrangements around on a couple of songs, but I still love it.  I highly recommend getting the deluxe version with the extra songs...one is sung by Winston!!!  :-D
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the best game ever I think. I think it is better than hen temple run. if u like temple run try this app. you'll love it! hope u like as much as I do! :)

B004GYY714|5.0|I love this app!!! But do you need wi fi connection to listen to music??? It has car mode, so does that mean you can be in the car while using this app with no wi fi??? Please answer me. I know...I m stupid
B007V2UGPE|5.0|cool the best it is fun for all ages good graph good theme I love it all should try it
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I read this book over 3 days and one of those days was a work day. The only thing I can wrong with this story is that I didn't write it. I burned out on SciFi about two years ago and went to mystery and adventure.<br /><br />I loved the concept of story telling trough a dairy. Unless any of us have been left in country by ourselves in the military we have no idea how hard it is to survive a week let alone a year and a half. This is the premise of the story. Having worked on the space shuttle (software engineer 1972-1974) and satellite tracking stations (1966-1967 on the Greenland Icecap) during my misspent youth I can testify that the characters depicted at NASA engineering and flight control are spot on as are the personalities of the people controlling the launches.<br /><br />The characters are believable, the plot moves along without being dragged down by descriptive narrative and the last 20% of the story had me staying up way too late on a Saturday night. This book at .99 cents is way undervalued. The other thing wrong is that this author only has one book on Amazon. Now we have to wait and wonder what the next one will be.<br /><br />Pat Price<br />Author: Newport Investigations
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|After waiting a year, The Mark of Athena finally came out! I wasn't sure what I expected, but I was very surprised by the way it turned out. Even so, this is by far the best book in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians/Heroes of Olympus series. It has all the comedy and humor, but plenty of action and suspense too! Rick Riordan really outdid himself, and as usual really left you in suspense. I won't give away anything that happened to you though! Just read it yourself! I am looking forward to the next book: House of Hades!<br /><br />  The only thing that I didn't like is that the names of the chapters are just names of heroes instead of funny things like: I Accidentally Vaporize My Pre-Algebra Teacher, as there were in the first series. But I guess that Rick Riordan had to name the chapters the way he did because otherwise you would get mixed up with who the chapter is talking about. This isn't very important though; it's the book that counts.<br /><br />  The Mark of Athena is certainly a must-read. I recommend getting it on kindle, because it is 10 dollars cheaper. But that's just my opinion. :D<br /><br />  Tony Rineheart
B00785P2QC|5.0|its a great game I love it. I feel like I'm a developer and I can help to build a better world.
1432794426|1.0|Oh boy, I am saddened to see so many fans support this just because it's positive toward MJ. It's badly researched! To me it seems like the lady wanted to get rich and knew if she wrote a pro-MJ book she would get lots of money from the fans no matter how poorly researched it was. She used the fans to get rich. Very sad. I for one am an MJ fan who does not support this book! It's exploiting the fans and their $. I recommened MJ Conspiracy by Aphrodite Jones or Geraldine Hughes book Redemption. Much better researched!
B0030ZRW9E|4.0|The Tommy and Tuppence series seem to me to be among the best of Agatha Christie's works, at least partly because of their freshness. Christie's later works are better in some ways because she hit her stride later on, but for a place to start reading, I'll take the Tommy and Tuppence books every time.
B0013AWTYG|5.0|This was one of the only CD's I was able to find of these guys back in the day when it was first released-seems so long ago as I was in HS.  I'm from the US and was disappointed that there was not more music released (or I did not hear of any) .  I was bummed of their break up, but happy to see that they are making a come back.  Just like the New Kids On The Block and Back Street Boys making their reunited albums, I look forward to hearing more of Take That also.
B003JTHXOK|1.0|While the subject matter of Safe Haven evokes strong emotion, the book disappoints with simple and sometimes inane dialogue and predictability.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I had wanted to read this book for the longest time, admittedly it was the cover art that drew me in. However the first time I tried to read it, I couldn't get into it. it seemed like I was never going to get past those first 20 pages. Once I did tho, I was very glad I pushed through, with a new (to me) twist on the supernatural world, I was hooked... I flew through the rest of the book in a matter of a few days. It becomes exciting, comical, and even gives you that hint of romance, with a jaw dropping cliff hanger ending. Can't wait for more.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Was exciting to read, was a slow start but getting in the story was<br />hard to put down, the ineteresting part was whendave Zinc ended<br />the story.

I can only connect to my brother. overall good work mojang
1612680011|1.0|If you plan on buying this book, only buy it used (so Kiyosaki doesn't profit from it) and for not more than a dollar (like I did). It's not worth anything more.<br /><br />First, this book is nothing more than a motivational tool that's marketed as something more. Aside from a few anecdotes of how Kiyosaki flipped real estate, there's no real tools or lessons on HOW to invest in and acquire assets. As someone who knows zilch about this (this is my first book reading up on the subject, and I did so because it came recommended by a friend), all I really learned in 200 pages is that I need to invest in assets, and that poor people invest in liabilities and rich people invest in assets. Like a record, Kiyosaki says this again and again. And again. Then again. If you lumped every paragraph and sentence together where Kiyosaki says this, it'd fill 40 pages of the book.<br /><br />As for the rest of the book, it's just insulting. Kiyosaki demeans poor, he insults his biological father to the point where he embarrasses his family name, and he even has the audacity to place blame for America's widening income-gap on the poor. Right. So let me get this straight, Kiyosaki: It's the poor's fault that they are financially illiterate (probably because they are born into a system where they lack the resources), yet people like your \\"Rich Dad\\" intimidate and manipulate such employees into remaining a \\"chicken little\\" (this is a term used toward the end of the book, basically his term for anyone who doesn't try to get wealthy through investing in assets because they are too scared). As for the middle class, we are basically just a bunch of scared losers according to him. Kiyosaki and his Rich Dad are a case of hypocrisy and greed at their most extreme.<br /><br />Political/social rant aside, Rich Dad Poor Dad is just a vague collection of \\"lessons\\" on how to motivate yourself to get rich -- not get rich itself. Although I won't label this guy's books and financial \\"tools\\" a scam, they're pretty close.
B008YL7MSA|4.0|The movie was fun and exciting, but why did kids have to kill eachother? Very sick. There must have been more to this than meets the eye. The sacrifice of an entire generation is not the way to save yourselves, it's the way of destroying yourself.
B006VSP906|4.0|Excellent book. very well written, in line with what you would expect from this legend. It is so heartening to see how well this intellectual superman has handled his own death. I am impressed with his straightforwardness and matter of fact presentation of his disease and his childlike innocence has inspired me a lot. His legendary last words would remain for eternity.....

B0070NSPCU|5.0|It's not often an author seemingly appears out of nowhere with something so polished, but Blood Song is easily one of the best and most compelling books I have read in a while.<br />It is well paced, has great development and was so engaging I actually finished the book and then re-read it again straight away.<br />Given the price of this book I would recommend all sci-fi/fantasy lovers purchase this, you seriously won't be disappointed.<br />Now, where is the sequel?
B002AWX6UM|5.0|Loved it....heart breaking but eye opening to the things children of other countries are exposed to and put through. Ishmael does a great job pulling you in to his journey.
014241722X|1.0|I have read almost all of John Grisham's books and I have enjoyed them all.  This book<br />is a great disappointment.  It moves slowly and it is boring in many parts<br />of the book.  The book ends abruptly at the end of chapter 22 with many issues<br />hanging in the air.  I called Amazon to ask when part of the book was missing.<br />They told me no chapter 22 is the last chapter and the last sentence that I read<br />to them was indeed the last sentence in chapter 22.  What a colossal disappointment.<br />Perhaps the story is continued in a second book.  I don't think I'll bother to find<br />out.
B007THA4FI|3.0|The \\"Casual Vacancy\\" is a story about the characters of a rural English town.  The character development was intense and in depth.  The story line was somewhat difficult to follow although I did manage to figure out how the story would end several chapters before the end of the book.  I realize I was affected by the \\"Harry Potter\\" series, but although well written, I did not enjoy the story.  The characters were much too intense and the story, maybe too close to real life for pleasure reading.  Maybe I'll like the next one better.  I won't give up over one book.
B008VBYN80|3.0|The game itself is pretty good, but the app has bugs (I've had to re-install once already and other glitches seem to pop up fairly regularly) and the play pushes \\"pay\\" services too much for my taste.

B008WCP2PG|2.0|...bad movie.  Oh, and not enough Matt Bomer!  This was a terrible movie.  The only redeeming quality was the male bodies and Channing's dancing.  The rest was trash.

B009NQKPUW|5.0|Great movie if you love alien, nice if you watch this then the first alien the aliens. Plays off of each other very well!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is just like the first one, simply amazing. From the moment you pick up this book you are thrown into a whirlwind of Eva and Gideon relationship. We get to see more if how unstable their love is and at the the same time feel the uncontrollable love they have for each other. Anxiously waiting for book 3, everyone should read this series.
B009329ZF2|5.0|great movie! great CGI. Flowed well. Never really understood the part of how they destroyed two of the alien ships though. They're smart enough to travel light years but can't see missiles headed at them at night?
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE EXCELLENT.  I WISH THAT IT DIDN'T END.  I WISH THAT SHE WOULD PUT OUT MORE BOOKS, SORTA IN THE SAME MATTER.  BOOK WAS EXCELLENT, TO THE POINT IT KEPT YOUR INTEREST.  IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I HAVE READ A PAGE TURNER.
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|I THINK THIS IS ANOTHER BOOK BY LEE CHILD THAT JUST MAKES YOU WANT TO KEEP TURNING THE PAGES. THE INTREGE THAT HE CREATES IS EXCEPTIONAL.  cOULD NOT PUT IT DOWN.
B001TAVL12|5.0|Scalzi is fast approaching the status of Dan Simmons... He's that freakin' good! The Old Man's  War series is nothing short of brilliant. A great deal of his vision WILL become real. The concept if Brainpals is pure genius and I voulg go on and on!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It may not be as good as the Pc version but they're going to make more updates I don't know why people are giving it bad reviews at all.
B005ELQVGW|5.0|Though it seems like everybody has said what I wanted to say about this album, I feel like I have to still throw my two cents in since I've been a devoted fan of Bj&ouml;rk's since I was in my teens. When it comes to lyrics, Bj&ouml;rk has always been in top form, so my review focuses more on Biophilia's music style rather than it's lyrics, and also explains what each song sounds like or represents. Furthermore, leave it to the genius of Bj&ouml;rk to take music to the next level by making an interactive app; the first app album ever actually. I don't know if it was a strategic ploy to sell more albums, but no matter, the app allows listeners to enter Bj&ouml;rk's mind while also letting the listener experiment with some of the songs and sounds themselves. The album echoes vocals from Medulla, instruments similar to Vespertine and Volta, and the technology that made Homogenic so groundbreaking. Therefore, Bj&ouml;rk is back at her zenith on Biophilia, and for me it is her most fulfilling album since Vespertine.
B0086700CM|4.0|I like this game because it is fast paced but sometimes freezes up on me... but over all I give it a 4
B007IXWKUK|5.0|All of the Fifty Shades books are amazing. Such page turners. I'm on the last of the three now and I honestly don't know what I'm going to do when I finish. Might just have to read them all again :)
B009HV2JT8|1.0|I just wonder when Directors and actors make movies do they realize they made a complete piece of S***? This movie was awful in every sense of the word. Cheesy CGI effects, too much slow-mo fight scenes, and just plain old terrible. I really wanted to like the movie and I gave it a chance but I could not  wait for it to end so I could try and forget that I actually paid to watch it. If you are on the fence about whether you will like this movie or not then don't throw your money away or just make some other poor dumb bastard pay for it and you watch it for free because it is not worth the money.
1423140605|5.0|I love Mark Of Athena. My daughter and I waited a year for it and it lived up to our expectations. The only problem now is that we have to wait a year for the next ook in the series. Thank you Rick Riordan!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great tool. other than wishing it would load first time when bringing up (and its still quick) its a handy good looking app.. keys are great size and easy to read. good clear display.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|The movie that explaines ALIEN!!  Love the Alien series.  This one completed it!!  Always wondered where they originated.  I've been collecting movies for the last 25+ years and this was a must-have!!
B005LAIGIM|2.0|You tried with this movie and I really appreciate that. You've made some stinkers and you've made some that had moments but never fully delivered. A Thousand Words is like that, albeit a mixture of your raunchy self with the Daddy Day Care part. It's not a great mix. You've either got to do one or the other. You make a nice but trite point about spirituality and finding inner peace and a whole lot of stuff that your character denounced as New Age garbage at one point, quite correctly, I might add, but it's not enough to elevate yet another pedestrian effort. If you're going to make a movie that touches my heart and has some profundity, go all the way and don't try to Eddie Murphy it up with your shtick because you end up pulling a Bill Murray trying to do The Razor's Edge, and it just doesn't work. I appreciate the effort, but it ends up being another in a really long string of duds. I'm sorry man, but that's the way I feel.<br /><br />You're so talented, Eddie. I mean, seriously. They should've created a special Oscar just for The Nutty Professor so you could've won both Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor all-in-one. There is no one in Hollywood who could've pulled those movies off, and that's no lie. But since then....what? Okay, Dreamgirls, but that was a supporting role in a Broadway hit. So, what's going on? Is it you? Are you hard to work with? Is it your agent? Is it that you simply don't care and only want to collect a paycheck? I wish I knew. I wish you knew so you could correct it. In the end, you know I'll watch your next movie because I still believe you have another home run inside of you. Don't give up and don't throw your talent away, Eddie. I'll be cheering for you.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />A fan<br /><br />P.S.<br />Please pass this letter on to Jim Carrey when you're done. Thanks.
0547848412|1.0|After reading so many glowing reviews I finally purchased this book. For the life of me I just could not get \\"into\\" reading this book, but I kept on going thinking there must be some redeeming quality that others are touting. Well there isn't! I should have followed my gut and returned the book. It was preachy in the first part, gory in the second and the ending was just awful!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the Misremebered Man. It was so moving and makes you realise the different attitudes of times gone by and hopefully gone for good. A remarkable and well written book.
B004Y5AV4M|3.0|I got bogged down in this one and the ending was kind of lame.  Perhaps my days of being a Georgette Heyer fan are coming to an end.
0763644765|5.0|We started reading this book to my daughter about 3 months ago and she loves it.  \\"Tinkle tinkle toot\\" and \\"Bye bye diaper!\\" have become our favorite phrases.  It really helped her get the idea that once she goes on the potty she gets undies.  She has pretty much memorized it now and picks it most every night for one of her bedtime books.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It's a very good app. It shows all the things you have used and hours of usage. Very good app
B003FXCSNQ|5.0|After a long absence from reading I found the book to be excellent. I've watched the film several times and it differed quite a lot. Definitely worth a read.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Very good match 3 game!!! Would not know any body that would not buy or play this game!!! My daughter loves this game!!!!
B007OCD1OO|1.0|This rating is not because I hate it. I found that, recorded abroad, I cannot play it on my LG DVD player. The player will not allow me to vary my regional code. You should warn buyers of this hazard.
B007THA4FI|1.0|this new book was the most depressing book i have ever read.  i cannot say it was not well written but it made me very sad and i like to read drama that has a bigger percentage of happy endings. i read all the time. i have been a heavy reader for 50+ years. i read all types. i love books but not 'casual vacancy'.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is the greatest, the only complaint that i have is when i started using it in 2009 the NASB was avaliable in audio and now its not. PLEASE bring it back.
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|Great movie, but I actually had to rent it elsewhere because the streaming through Amazon was very buggy. I thought it was my internet, but I have rented movies from other websites before. Somewhat disappointed. Either way, the movie is good, but the story isn't anything to think back on. Some of the best scenes revolve around the Hulk and one or two from Iron man.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|Ive read some of the best and worst books out there.  Im NOT BRAGGINGwhen my husband asks me to put them in boxes to store! No way!<br /><br />But this book broke my heart. I LITTELLRY JUMPED FOR JOY WHEN UPS CAME!!!  But i was sooo confused from the beginning. Cant they have gotten over that really strong BS in the beginning. She admits sex is coping for her.  So she does it?  And the period thing? Her eating so much! Was or IS SHE PREGGIE OR NOT! Thats disaster. I was happy with the end NOT BECAUSE IT WAS OVER. Although im glad i didint have to read more crap!<br /><br />FINALLY SHE GREW A PAIR!!!!! Got everyone straight and let them know she was ALPHA FEMALE by her ALPHA MALE. she dint protect him. She told them no rose colored glasses from her and they could shove it! Best part of the book!<br /><br />I had to give it a 2. As long as we waited i am really dissapointed. Oh well. Its all a matter of tast. But if you did read \\"Bared to You\\". You have to!  And none of that \\" if you like 50 shades\\". Ugh. Im soo tired of seeing that!<br /><br />Sorry Sylvia, hopwe can compromise on thel last book with some hmmmmms
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I didn't love the 3rd installment of the Tinkerbell movies but this one was perfect! I loved the storyline and the bond between Tink and Periwinkle. I thought it was a great showing of just how close two sisters can be and how far they will go to protect one another. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! I also should add that I'm a 24 year old who loves this movies independently of having kids to watch them with ;)
B0063HBPH6|5.0|An absorbing, provocative, and absolutely hilarious read that is thoroughly entertaining from start to finish. I can't recommend this highly enough.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|great time passer. slow moving but challenging. makes you want to continue to see what the next pride is gonna be.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A mentally stimulating game for all ages. As an educator I appreciate upper level thought processes the app engages.  As a mom I love the fact that I can share it with my 4 and 7 year olds on the lower levels and enjoy quality time together&hellip;then I can challenge myself on the upper levels! What a fun way to exercise your brain!
B004UID2LC|2.0|I downloaded all my favorite songs and was extremely disappointed in the very low sound quality. The videos look and sound great, though. But it seems that I can only access the videos through the app, as they don't appear in the 'video' tab on my kindle, unlike the songs which do appear in the 'music' tab. A darn shame.
B00846REIS|2.0|I left this book not caring what made Cross so jacked up... too many potential stories left open.. like A.D.D. where is my shoe anyway??
B0086700CM|3.0|...this app doesn't even work on android 2.3. Shame. I was really looking forward to playing this game. Moving on.
1400052181|5.0|This is a remarkable book.  The research done by the author Rebecca Skloot is truly outstanding. She did a remarkable job of digging out the scientific information and at the same time she told the story of the Lacks family in a very human way.  The story as told by Skloot also makes clear what some of the moral and ethical issues are for the medical community. It is truly a powerful and important book.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|excessive permissions. in app purchases. TONS of fake reviews.  amazon better start screening these better or people wont trust apps here. you don't want this bubble to burst.
0316228532|1.0|I am half way thru the book and find it very gossippy, if that is a word.  Not much of a story line.  Maybe it will get better.<br /><br />I thought Rowlings was more of a thriller novelist.
0525953728|5.0|This book was great from the start. Tons of detail awesome action and a great story. I would recombined it to anyone.
B00671A9RK|5.0|Ogni volta è commuovente la lettura di questo libro.<br /> L'autore ti riporta con grande maestria nei panni del bambino che è in te, stuzzicandoti a vedere il mondo con gli occhi di allora e con l'esperienza da adulto di oggi.<br />Un capolavoro che andrebbe inserito nelle scuole per la ricchezza del contenuto.<br />E' una poesia.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|The colors are so vibrant in this movie and the storyline and graphics are captivating.  Kids will love it as adults.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a fun easy game for kids 5+. The only thing I didn't like is that you get multiple quests at a time and it gets confusing to keep up.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I loved this movie! It had a great story line. Im a big lover of soap operas and I would have loved to of seen this as a soap opera :)
B0098VYKSA|2.0|This movie was not nearly as good as I hoped it would be.  Had some intertesting characters and special effects but I never really \\"got into\\" the movie.
0793518326|5.0|The editors did their research on the music, like how both 6 string guitars parts are shown along with the bass line.  The parts sound like the recorded songs, not close like some other song books I have used.
0060873175|1.0|The story is poorly written, with horrendous dialog, a predictable plot, cardboard characters, and an unrealistic premise that has been overused in Honey I Shrunk the Kids and other movies and novels. Appalling that it was made into a book.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I didn't think it could get any better than Bared to You but this book is even better.  Right from the first page you are drawn in and you just cannot put this book down because you can't wait to see what is going to happen next.  Sometimes I cried, sometimes my stomach churned and I had heart palpitations while going through life with Eva and Gideon.  They are proof that love isn't easy and failure is not an option.  Even a day after finishing the book I just can't stop thinking about Eva and Gideon.  Did I say I loved this book.  I can't say it enough and cannot wait for Entwined With You to continue the Eva and Gideon saga.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Familiar and unfamiliar events of WWII  woven into complex plots, populated with cardboard characters linked by absurd coincidences.  Not his best effort.
B009NQKXYK|1.0|Stupid story. Just a let down. Could of done so much more with the engineer interaction in the whole story. The different variances of the seed spiders from Alien was cool but that is the extent of my enjoyment.
0553582038|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this book. The writing quality is on par with the previous books. The character development is as good, if not better than, the other three. So why did I leave off a star (or two)?<br /><br />Simply put: this book appears to be a sideshow. Up until now the characters that I have enjoyed the most, and that have moved the action the most, have been: Tyrion, Jon Snow, and Daenerys. All three are absent from this book. Instead all our time is spent with Cersei, Jamie, Brienne, and to a lesser extent Sansa, Arya and Sam.<br /><br />I like what Martin did in the cases of Brienne and Jamie Lannister. He made them much more sympathetic, while turning Cersei into a genuine villain. He also devoted several chapters to what appears to be a minor subplot in Dorne involving House Martell and Princess Myrcella. I was perplexed at the prologue as it appeared to have NO BEARING whatsoever on the rest of the story but its relation was only explained in the last chapter (and, in the end, proved intriguing).<br /><br />So, I suppose I will have to trust Martin to tie all these events into the larger cycle of the book. I just wish he hadn't taken nearly 700 pages to do. For whatever reason I don't read Martin very quickly so reading one of his books represents a disproportionate share of my reading time.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|Couldn't get it to work, just kept asking for more downloads.  So we didn't play it & I really can't give a very good review.
0515142247|2.0|I guess I have read too many thrillers because the ones I read now just don't seem to thrill me at all. This is the second book in the popular Reacher series featuring modern-day knight-errant Jack Reacher.<br /><br />Reacher is an interesting and original character. A West Point alum and former Army MP who has basically dropped out of his previous life to just wander, footloose and fancy free, across the United States. Of course in the course of his wanderings he gets involved in different adventures. In this case he is an innocent bystander when an FBI agent is kidnapped. As the story unfolds we learn that the agent is no ordinary FBI agent and Reacher must come to the rescue.<br /><br />Child's writing style is easy enough to follow and I got through the book quickly enough. The information is also competently researched and where necessary Child provides some good technical detail. There are a couple of twists and turns but, for me at least, they failed to provide much surprise or suspense.<br /><br />One thing I did notice is that Reacher does a lot of shrugging. It seems on every third page Reacher shrugs. I suppose this goes along with his nonchalant persona but Child should either cut back on the amount of shrugs or find some synonyms or other gestures Reacher can use.<br /><br />I don't feel like I am explaining my lack of enthusiasm for this book very well. It certainly wasn't enough to preclude me from reading other books; it just didn't grab me.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|This is a fun, great album. Kill The DJ!! Lots of swearing. Be careful if young kids are in the car. I love this album.
0307950689|2.0|This is the fourth Dan Brown book I have read ('The DaVinci Code', 'Angels and Demons' and 'Digital Fortress'). There are certain aspects - the history behind symbols, the codes - that are quite enjoyable. There are others that I didn't like very much at all. Some of the characters were laughable, especially the diminutive, dragon lady, Inoue Sato. The idea of a tiny, sixty-something, female CIA division chief making grown men wet their pants because of her killer reputation is just absurd. Not to mention her trampling over the civil rights of US citizens. Puh-leez!<br /><br />In this one, I figured out the secret identity of the villain pretty quickly. By process of elimination there was really only one person it could be for the reveal to have any shock value. Also, I guessed the hiding place of the Lost Symbol pretty quickly. I must say that when the Lost Symbol was finally revealed it was pretty disappointing. All throughout the book Brown tries to get the reader to think that the Lost Symbol is some kind of talisman with magical, mystical powers and it turns out to be something quite mundane.<br /><br />So, if I didn't like the book that much, why did I read it? Well, I got stuck in Kabul and finished the book I was reading and didn't have anything on deck. I went to the PX and had to choose from a very limited selection. I chose poorly. I probably won't rush to read any more Dan Brown books any time soon.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|What a GOD!<br />Looks better on Blu-ray, and well worth the extra cost when watching the special effects. Not much as far as bonus features though...
0765326353|5.0|I found out about Brandon Sanderson when he was picked to finish the Wheel of Time series. Since then i have read everything he has written. What can i say about this book? The first of a ten part series. It is amazing! Great Story! Great Characters!<br />You will not be disappointed in this book. Buy it!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This book was good and the professional narration that came with it made the book all the better. Ive read it before but this was the best time yet.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|We've not even finished watching homeland and absolutely love it. Characters are well built, the acting is great, and the story is good enough to create suspense and excitement. Definitely recommended!
B000SEGUDE|4.0|I really enjoyed this book but went to the movie before finishing it. Big mistake, I was 60% finished and should have waited to see how the stories ended. This rarely happens to me but in this case I liked the movie better than the book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so addicting and fun and if you fill lucky buy a mystery box because there can be as much as 100000 coins.please get this game its so fun!!!
B000SEGUDE|4.0|This book is six very different stories, occurring in different time periods that on the surface have nothing to do with each other. Yet, they do... in a subtle way. I basically plowed through it in 3 days. Once you are past the first chapter (thank God for Kindle's in-built Dictionary), not keep on going is almost impossible. I found staggering the way the author changes the voices in each chapter so as each one conveys the time and set flawlessly. Although I'll admit this book might not be for everyone, for me is one of the best reads this year, thus far.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is awesome because you get to pass many obstacles through out the game.I love it!its so cool! GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!;D
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game!! Just wish coins charged faster when I'm not on the app. But other then that this game is amazing.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|I was duly impressed with this application until I got to the end and it won't let me SAVE IT! I will give higher rating if I figure it out or its updated
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|fun little game when you need to kill a lttle time. my only complaint is that it would be nice if you could trade in coins for dozer dollars to prevent the game from becoming stagnant.
0062127241|5.0|Nutshell review, from a devoted Who fan.....<br /><br />I had been looking forward to this autobiography SO much- awaiting that incredibly ascerbic and honest Townshend wit; as well as the ability to cut to the chase while still fleshing out details- and I mainly found that it skims over most every story that could mean so much to the reader; if only some personal details had been committed to it.<br /><br />A writer of Pete's stature does not need to conform to the industry rock memoir one volume 'take'- Townshend, with his insight, wit and verbosity, has earned the right to publish veritable volumes of detailed material for devoted Who fans, who would scour every word and hug on to it tight!!!<br /><br />One small example- Pete in the book mentions that he was asked by Macca to eulogize Linda- but it is simply stated as a fact.... No detail, no feeling, no sense of being there, to attach the reader's heart to it.... SO many of the books 'facts' were given such short shrift. The tears and laughter of a books reader, are in the details that the author gives: that the reader can identify with and therefore feel a part of. For a writer of Pete Townshend's stature- perhaps a several volume set with MUCH more detail of life and band events, would be the only pacifying and acceptable substitute for a one volume memoir.... With that said, much love to you Pete, and thanks forever and ever! for the life soundtrack, the lyrics, and for your brilliance as a musician!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This is an awsome knife...The shape of it makes this perfect for any chores that need done around the camp or even at home around the yard it is also an intimidating to ones who like to enter peoples homes unexpectedly. Thank you. This knife is Badass and in good shape.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love the game! Get lost trying win more coins. Good clean wholesome fun!! I used to play this game at Dave &amp; Buster's &amp; win big. Now I don't have to spend crazy money to win!
B0034JKZ86|3.0|I love the animation that was done in the film, and the New Orleans infused storyline.  To me, Disney has needed an African American princess for some time.  However, why does she have to be a frog for half the film?  I think Disney would have been better off taking a Cajun culture fairytale and bringing it to life in a movie.  That way the New Orleans flavor could be still infused into the storyline. All of the other Disney princesses, except Mulan, were princesses in their own right and didn't have to kiss a frog to do so.  Disney has issues creating princesses that aren't white.
0374275637|5.0|I won't write a long review. Partly because there are so many already, partly because I need to go out and get more coffee.<br /><br />This book is part memoir where Kahneman's joy of research and discovery and his long-lasting collaboration with Amos Tversky are clear to be seen.<br /><br />It is also incredibly rich in its information. If you liked Ariely's Predictably Irrational (as I did very much), this is an excellent follow-up.
B000V6U89Q|5.0|Cecilia Bartoli stands alone in her precision and control. She brings such beauty to the music she sings. One of my absolute favorites.
B008NABUU8|3.0|This game has its iratating moments. It will flip flop with my kindles gyro<br />and the bridges are very hard to make.
B0031R5K8G|4.0|This is a well written book that captivates and entertains all the way through. It's a quick read, and is fast moving and very funny. The author's ability to provide insights into the workings of the brain of a young autistic boy is excellent - it all makes such perfect sense and ought to be read by anyone who has contact with someone with autism.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its like temple run totally awesome for any age  ver very fun GET IT its free and fun addicting  awesome
030758836X|5.0|I could not put this book down.  It was a fantastic ride.  There was truth in the characters as well.  I would find myself rooting for one then the other and having sympathy for both.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I'm a huge minecraft fan and I love my kindle fire. But this app isn't nearly as good as the Pc. Its fun for awhile but gets boring.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This is an excellent guide for anyone who is interested in using Kindle as a major platform for their book.
B0086700CM|5.0|No problems. Runs smooth and its very fun. I highly recommend this game to people of all ages. I have experienced multiple problems on android devices but not on the kindle fire.
B0071BGOJC|3.0|I found the book disappointing.  After reading the first book of the trilogy I was impatient to see the second book. Although the author continues to base his story on historical events the plot is contrived and the writing is not up to his usual standard.
B000J159N8|5.0|I had the privilage to meet the wife of Lt. Col. Frank Vaverk. He was a member of the 7th Cav. and was in the battle shown in the movie and was friends with several officers there. I have the deepest respect for soldiers that are brave and devoted to duty. They are the reason we enjoy freedom. God Bless them and keep them safe. I must say the movie brought me to tears because it was so realistic.  Thanks  Joseph
B00005QGAZ|5.0|What's to say?!? Its Michael Jackson at his finest....before he went goofy. This is \\"classical\\" music and will live on forever. 5 stars only cuz there ain't 6!<br />Oh, and Amazon has the best selection and best service. Period.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Casual Vacancy - I was so looking for J.K. Rowling's new book, but was slightly disappointed.  I'm not quite sure what I was expecting but I felt let down.  I did not expect a \\"Harry Potter\\".  I was intrigued by her characters, I just wasn't that interested in them.  I was able to put the book down and really didn't care if I finished it or not.  I did finish it and thought if was just O.K..
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was a wonderfully written and carefully researched book.  I enjoyed all of it even when I was angry with the characters.
0760335540|5.0|This well written, well organized volume with loads of detailed color photographs is a treasure of projects both large and small, easy and difficult, for all those who love their Boxsters and love to do repairs and improvements on the object of their automotive affection. I bought this book because I wished to replace the convertible top myself (among other things) and found a detailed, intricately documented chapter on my proposed project. I also found numerous other little and large projects which I hope to undertake as soon as I can muster the time and tools. Altogether a wonderful piece for Porsche Boxsterholics.
B005PM3YII|5.0|Mind blowing. A fittingly epic end to the mistborn trilogy.<br />I'm inspired and I can see why Sanderson was chosen to close the wheel of time. Can't wait for January :)
0316228532|2.0|I was sorry about this - it had such a negative view, rather than any sense of the uplifting.  I am baffled - even though the author explained the reasons why people were they way they were, the sum was good or bad.  There was no deep belief in humanity, not much pulling it out of the day-to-day.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I am hooked on the characters Eva and Gideon and this next book in the series did not disappoint.  I look forward to the next book.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I couldn't put the book down and when I got to the end I wanted more but unfortunately I have to wait until Fall of 2013.  I alway enjoy Rick Riordans books and wish that he could write them faster as the waiting is almost too much.  I love the way he always covers everyone of the characters and this book was even better the way in wrote and titled each character.  The ending was one that made you want the next book immediately and I for one can't wait.<br /><br />Sharon
B009VB7QQA|4.0|Great action movie and actors. The characters are well rounded and the plot flowed. I would like to see a sequel to this.
1603427244|5.0|This book has so many cast-on and bind-off stitches that I didn't even know existed!  I've really enjoyed trying out the variety of stitches.  The instructions are very clear and supported by pictures.
B009VB97EY|1.0|This movie has no entertaining value at all. It was slow and even gross at times. The characters showed no depth and the acting was quite poor.  I had to fast forwarded a bit of the movie just to make it through to the end. What a waste of money and my time.

B008RZF1UO|5.0|In my opinion, Kamelot has never released a truly bad album, just less awesome ones. Poetry for the Poisoned was one of those less than fantastic albums, so I am really glad that they didn't release a worse album. Instead, they released one that is on-par with my favorite albums by them (Epica and The Black Halo). I can't help but notice that when they theme their album releases off a story they come up with their best albums.<br /><br />It's not just the story that flows from one song to the next, though, as the music slides across the tracks with ease and beauty. The music is fantastic, and the musical theme that they chose (a small melody that actually evolves into the chorus of the title song) is highly adaptive. Every single song that had that little melody in it used it in a different way, which I personally find awesome. The band also managed to craft another album without a single filler or boring track. I don't know how they do it, but I would open iTunes and listen to any of the songs on this album and be satisfied.<br /><br />Now, to touch on the new lead singer. I know that any fan of Kamelot is sad that Roy Khan (their previous, god-like lead singer) left the band. However, I can gladly report that their new singer, Tommy Karevik (from the also great band, Seventh Wonder), fills Khan's absence perfectly. He has his own sound, but he does his best Khan impersonation and pulls it off well, and I never once thought that Khan could have done a better job with the song.<br /><br />To end, I just want to have a brief summary of this album. It opens up and ends with absolutely gorgeous instrumental tracks and everything in between is catchy enough to find yourself singing along with it afterwards. If you were on the edge of buying this but were having doubts, take my word for it and purchase this album. You will definitely not regret it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|great app that works well. could allow upgrades easier since some items are hard to come by.  otherwise overall is decent. would reccomend to others to play.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I saw this movie seven times in theaters and it was just as great the last time as it was the first. On DVD, it's just as good.<br /><br />What I love about The Avengers and other films with large, intertwining story lines (because the prior Marvel films like Iron Man and the like do continue into this) is that I manage to pick up something new every time I watch it, so every time is a new experience.<br /><br />As for the DVD itself, it plays well and the quality is good, but I'm still a bit upset over the lack of special features. There's an short featurette that goes over the cast and what makes them good for their respective roles and that was interesting to watch. The audio commentary was decent, but it dragged in some parts. On a side note, I listened to the Spanish audio track for fun, and while some voices didn't match, it was a pretty decent dub overall.<br /><br />If what you really want is just the movie, I'd say to just stick with the DVD. I'm sure the other special features like bloopers and deleted scenes are floating around the internet.

0307744434|5.0|I loved how creative this book is written.  The account of \\"The Night Circus\\" is so vivid that you don't want the imagery to end.  I highly recommend this book as it is so different from any other!

B004YEJGEO|5.0|I enjoy both the color and reasoning aspects pf this game! I would like more levels and another game with similar qualities. Please.
B001TAJGO6|5.0|At a quick glance is seems kind of strange and slow paced. But if you sit and carefully watch the movie without interruption from start to finish, it's a very deep movie. Very well produced.  But there are a lot of things that happen from the start to the middle of the movie that don't make a lot of sense unless you get to through the very end. I suggest watching the movie twice, you will pick-up on more subtle hints the second time around.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|I was very dissapointed in the film. It the plot wasn't cohesive. It could have been a great film, but the directing/writing left so many holes in what could have been solid film. By the end it should have left me imagining the possibilites, but what I felt what \\"Ummmm what the heck was that?\\" I have been told this was a prequal to Alien...Even that doesn't make it good. :(
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I've heard endless complaints about there being no answers in this movie to where the aliens came from, what the green goo is, etc. etc. Well, when was the last time you went to a movie and actually had to think about the content? To use your imagination to fill in the spaces that the movie didn't do for you? I think it adds that element to the story that allows you to do the digging yourself and connect it without having it all laid out on the table, which makes the anticipation for the next movie all the greater for me.<br /><br />It's introduced some amazing new ideas (ie the Engineers, the predecessors to the Aliens, other worlds and possibly other creatures to discover, the evolution of the Alien race, why the Engineers decided to destroy us and why they never made it to Earth), and continued with some of the original ones (unprofessional crew even though there'd be nothing fun to the movie if they were more professional/intelligent, cliffhangers up til the end, unfinished business at the end of the movies), which to me is everything necessary for a re-imagined prequel, which is essentially what this movie boils down to. If everything directly funneled into the beginning of Aliens, then where would you go from there? While this is a prequel, it serves the purpose of allowing us to explore more into the Alien/Engineer Universe, and I can't wait to see what they come up with next.
B003VANOFY|3.0|I have listened to music without my hearing aids and even with my poor hearing, the music sounds very good, but when I use my behind-the-ear hearing aids, they whistle  very loadly.  One of the things I noticed is the headset fits tight against my ears and it becomes uncomfortable after a while.  I haven't used the microphone feature, so I can not comment about that.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|In these days of depressing news shows, reality television that is anything but starring people who can't even spell talent, and shows that are supposed to be funny but just aren't--I wish there were more shows like \\"Fawlty Towers\\" and more episodes of the one we do have.  This has to be John Cleese at his most hysterical (and yes, I am counting Monty Python as well) and this show is the premier definition of laugh-out-loud funny.  My personal favorite episodes are \\"The Germans\\" and \\"Basil the Rat\\" but I love them all--if you're feeling low after a hard day and just want to escape into a world of zaniness to forget, this is your show--take my word for it and enjoy!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|so far it been very easy to do the same things on the desktop version but had to learn how to move around on the page like the desktop. but would give this app very high praises and would say not to miss out on your facebook on the go.looks awesome on the kindle fire hd screen. specially pictures. dont miss out on all the fun download today. lol.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Its a great game.fun to play and way to pass the time when is cold or rainy out. My kids love it
0525953728|3.0|well the book is about his seal days rather then bin laden raid. He has mentioned very limited things about how bin laden was found. He hasn't even mentioned about vaccination strategy with the help of a pakistani doc which led to bin laden, not even mentioned about radar evading helicopter that was used. Probably he was just to cautious about writing classified  info. He just used the hype of the raid to sell his book. If you are interested in a marines life then it would suit you other wise the internet will tell much more interesting fact about the raid rather than the book.
B004LSO6YI|5.0|Great movie! believable story line, the acting is what sold it. It sets a new standard for lesbian films. you won't regret sitting down to watch this.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The last book of the Fifty Shades trilogy brings together all the threads of the plot in a very satisfying way, especially from the standpoint of Christian Grey's emotional and psychological healing through love.  All the author's characters are believable, with their strengths, weaknesses and foibles.  I read the entire trilogy in less than 10 days, and was left wishing for more. Well done, E. L. James!  I'm a captive reader of whatever else you may write!
B009NQKPUW|2.0|The visuals and a couple of the main characters were pretty good, but just about everything else was bad. The story didn't have much there, like the alien movies. Most of the characters were complete idiots that I was hoping would die. I think Ridley Scott has lost the touch.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A page turner from beginning to end!  I started reading Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy under the impression that it was all about eroticism (based on the descriptions of people who had read it).  How wrong I was!  Although there are numerous passages that are extremely erotic, it seems to me that the author's ultimate goal is to delve into the darkest corners of the human psyche through her main male character, Christian Grey. In every aspect, erotic, psychological and plotwise, the author never disappoints!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I played it on my kindle. As always I loved the storyline, very realistic,  cool puzzles, no zoom but you don't need it, very hands on, you had to go over your clues to figure out where the ojects should go, this hidden objects game does not disappoint
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book two of the Fifty Shades trilogy continues the story seamlessly from where it left off in book one.  I simply couldn't put it down!  I had to know what was going to happen to the two main characters, Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey, and how she would go about uncovering his emotional and psychological secrets.  It's a fascinating love story with a variety of elements that makes it all the more interesting.  Little by little, Anastasia peels away the layers of Christian's psyche like the layers of an onion, trying to reach his core.  E.L. James is superb!
145551389X|5.0|Im really happy about this product, quite cheap and goood quality and fast delivering, really worth buying even if your not a lady gaga fan!

B001ANSS5K|4.0|An interesting and intelligent read for teenagers to oldies who loved to explore as teenagers.  I could relate to all the characters.  The book shows the good in people without becoming sloppy.
B00377V6IS|5.0|Eu não gostava deste album, achava a música título muito longa, com a parte central \\"boring\\", mas isso ocorria quando ouvia a versão ao vivo.... Este album, com a produção das guitarras e voz feitas pelo Stven Wilson fez toda a difereança. Inclusive o próprio SW canta em Bleak e faz backing vocals nas outras músicas. Bleak é a melhor!

1451695195|1.0|Don't believe the PAID reviews that are currently in the top 2 slots.<br /><br />This was marketed as having a scientific approach, I found no science anywhere, there was no scientific discussion about the experiences to act as the \\"proof\\" in the title. Simply having a disease does not qualify as science, I don't care how medically unique it is, go ask a dude with Ebola if he feels scientific. This is a personal story, and most of it is focused upon what others told him happened in the hospital. None of the spiritual experiences were properly examined and argued against or even FOR. It's a good story but it's marketed misleadingly, and while I applaud the lack of the typical 'prostrating in glory' that's in all the other NDE books as well as any other typical blind faith psychosis, I feel misled by how this book was advertised and can't apply any of it to helping my own spirituality. I NEEDED the science so bad but it's not here. Hell, I even prayed this would give me some evidence before buying it....<br /><br />Here are the biggest issues:<br />1)Author states 'all of his questions were answered...'; WHAT QUESTIONS?! They're not in the book! I imagine this area would've been a good one to cover even for being interesting alone....I think all of the NDE experience in the book can fit on 5-6 pages, and with the formatting that's not a lot! Ok there's a wormy type place with faces, and a really cool upper place with a shiny/dark core....what else? Some girl on a butterfly wing? How the hell does that work, where's the rest of the butterfly?!<br />2)Ok, E. Coli meningitus -> non-functioning neocortex = more valid experience. I buy the arguement, but where's the further examination of the experience? Seeing as conciousness is not yet fully understood, we expect to at least be humored with an attempt of applying the scientific method in a book that's supposed to have been scientificly based. How is this book helping those of us that are engineers and scientists believeif what we require for proof is not even present or attempted?<br />3)Nice, you're a prestigious doctor. Thanks for all the help you've done for people, truly. But does this need to be repeated throughout the book? It seems like other types of data could better have filled the pages and helped out the reader.<br />4)Not alot about the actual NDE itself.<br /><br />So it's a good read for the coffee table, but I wouldn't buy it again. Especially since it was supposed to attempt to give actual evidence or proof obtained scientifically. He could've done it, especially with the medical circumstance he was in, but instead it fails and is just another personal story.
B008PWUWLC|5.0|I was looking for a durable, tight fitting, protective jacket for my Kindle Fire.  I could not have asked for anything better than this jacket made by Timbuk2.  This jacket does a great job of being perfectly fit for the Fire.  Your Fire will not move around in this jacket, will not fall out, and the jacket will not scratch your screen.  I would enjoy this jacket a bit more if the entire jacket was grey or a solid color but that is beside the point.<br /><br />If you are looking for a jacket that will hold your Fire perfectly, will protect your screen from scratches, and is not bad to look at, this jacket is for you!
1451695195|1.0|This book has nothing to do with heaven, in spite of its catchy title. I read it expecting the account of a scientist and doctor who had come to believe in God, and by God, I mean Jesus. Instead this book is borderline occult. The only time Jesus is referred to, it is in a very skeptical way. While Dr. Alexander has occasionally attended an Episcopal church, it is quite clear from his book that he has never actually had a personal relationship with Jesus. His near-death experience is a fascinating exploration of life after death and his book definitely gives credence to the reality of a spiritual existence outside of the body. However, in no way does Dr. Alexander ever \\"prove\\" the existence of heaven. Whatever spiritual experiences he may have had while he was technically \\"brain dead,\\" they have nothing to do with heaven in a true Christian sense.<br /><br />I bought this book after reading preview excerpts forwarded to me by a Christian friend. Those excerpts are VERY MISLEADING. Dr. Alexander clearly does not believe in Jesus and in fact appears to hold New Age, metaphysical, and quite possibly demonic-influenced views of the spirit life after death. If you know Jesus, do not waste your money or your time on this book. I am sorry that I did.
0316228532|1.0|Do not read this book.  Absolutely loved the Harry Potter books and while I recognize this is an entirely different type of story to be read by an entirely different group of readers I still would not recommend it.  About 3 chapters in the language turned filthy and pornographic.  I gave it another couple of chapters and it did not improve.  The book seems to bring out the worst in all it's characters.  It's a shame that someone who wrote such brilliant children's literature writes such awful adult fiction.
1451695195|5.0|The only thing that stopped me reading was the need to wipe my eyes. My tears were blurring my vision. Though--especially if you are in the medical profession--you still might not believe in heaven, I don't think it's possible for anyone to read this book and not believe in love.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Reputable Seller.  All 4 discs PRISTINE viewing, sound.  Each 1,3,5,7 disc has both Theater presentation and Director's cut.  Myriad PERKS.  Discs 2, 4, 6, 8 info on 4 Alien movies.

B001NIA27E|5.0|This is an excellent movie with a good story line that seems very realistic. Good enough to watch over and over again.
B004LP3AYI|4.0|I'm hooked.  The story is great, if drawn out in some spots.  You feel you really know the characters after the first book!  My biggest problem with book two, on my Kindle, is the number of publishing errors per page!  Wish Amazon had worked to resolve those errors, made the reading just a little aggravating.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Works perfectly, and have had no problems with it, except where to put it when not connected? What more can I say, except that Apple shouldn't have changed the connection in the first place.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Every now and again a plot comes along that is so intriguing words are hard to find to describe the story. Pines by Blake Crouch is that kind of story. Pines takes the reader on a journey that stops in a town straight out of the Twilight Zone, or The X Files. the plot is hard to describe without giving too much away. So, the best recommendation I can give to a reader is strap on your seat-belt and enjoy the expedition. You are in for a extraordinary ride.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys are amazing, inspired and entertaining.  Their music is such a breath of fresh air as they offer a fresh take on some of the classics.  Who would have thought someone could create so many different sounds from just a cello and a piano?  Recommended as a great gift for just about anyone.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it is so fun I love the little wishing it looks so good I love wishing it taste good
B007MAETA8|5.0|Can't believe I'm saying this, but Born and Raised is fast becoming my most favorite album from Mayer, even passing Continuum. This is easily one of top 5 album this year so far. My bad that I wrote him off too early after Battle Study which despite having several tunes I really like, but overall fell short. But Born and Raised really makes me have new found appreciation of Mayer's talent and really gets me excited about his future. He's really one of the most exciting young singer/songwriters these days.<br /><br />When I listen to this at night, it builds a complete different mood in me. kind of sad, yet still a bit hopeful. Anyway, I just wanna add that this album really is another whole new level emotionally comparing to his previous albums. Less prettier, but touches me deeper.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|Although it's nowhere near perfect, Snow White and the Hunstman has a lot of good things going for it. Charlize Theron is easily the best part of the film, and I thought she deserved more screen time. Kristen Stewart, in typical Kristen Stewart form, is flat and emotionless. I'm hoping she keeps mailing in her performances so she can just go away. Hemsworth is good here, although I think he's underutilized as well. Another great aspect about the movie is the special effects, which are truly great. I think with different casting in the lead role, and a tighter script, this movie could have been a lot better.
B007TK77QE|2.0|The casual vacancy was the title we were waiting for maybe cause we were expecting another harry potter or that we were thirsty for another book from the Famous JK ROWLING.<br />the result came very disapointing and shoking.<br />the book was very slow and the characters werent interesting at all.<br />the story was very boring that tell you about the life of ordinary people in a village that sounds dull .<br />the plot was lacking suspense and surprises.<br />I could have put it down long time before the 3rd chapter even but i kept given Rowling more chances until it ended with a very disapointing , Is that it!
B0015DWJX2|5.0|This novel was pure joy - I just loved it.  A wonderful and unique way of telling<br />about the German occupation of the island.  You come to love and root for the<br />islanders.  A real winner!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE this game! Personally I think it is better than Temple Run because it is different and I like the theme. Everyone should get it!!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book could have been written by a horny teenager. The text was elementary and<br />repetitive.  After the first shocking sex scene, the rest of the book was redundant.<br />I have no desire to read the other two in the series.  It was a waste of my money.<br />I was sucked in by the hype and I haven't found anyone who actually enjoyed it.
B007SSEBCU|3.0|I was disappointed in this movie.  Meryl Streep was great, as always, but I wasn't impressed with the story line.  It was too girly; like it was written to appeal to women who have no real interest in politics or the difficulties of being a woman executive in a man's world.  The movie seemed to concentrate on silly things instead of the inner strength this woman must have had to succeed as she did.  I hoped to learn more about Margaret Thatcher as a leader.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Great album, reminds me a bit of Mumford, very distinct sound. Gets better every time i listen! Buy this one

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I highly recommend this book...I haven't read anything by Stephen King in a long time and I must say, he continues to be a talended, creative, and a wonderfully engaging writer. I was 15 years old when President Kennedy was assasinated and I have visited Dealy Plaza a couple of times and toured the museum on the 6th floor of the book depository. Having been alive on that day, provided me with a distinct familiarity with the times and the events that took place...this definitely contributed to enhancing my fascination with this book....a great read.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Delightful continued saga, entertaining, educating.  Good gift too.  Library \\"wait list\\" too long so bought it for Kindle.  Looking forward now to third in the series.

B008673ZAQ|4.0|I thought this was a nice change. The sex scenes were great without being too much of the same every time and the break from all the sex was nice too. It made me like it more when it finally came around to another. I thought there was a lot left unexplained, though I assume the author is planning on making this at least a trilogy. I enjoy the love story as well. I only read the sample of 50 Shades, but even with that, I have to say the writing here is a million times better than 50. I can't understand why this series is not at least as popular.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Having a good time playing this with my granddaughter, who is 1,000 miles away.<br />She is 7 years and this is perfect for us to enjoy.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I really loved this CD.  It is a great way to gain inspiration.  I like the way that each song has a different story.
B0081BU42O|5.0|And like most of his best stories, the Minds of the Culture play the largest role. This story finally gives some insight into the process of Subliming, when a civilization up-and-goes to become one of the Elder Species. Of course, there's a dirty secret in the past of the Gzilt and an associated incident means that the knowledge of this secret could affect the whole Sublimation. I think the weakest part of the book is that the ending doesn't quite feel like it \\"paid off\\", but that's a possible (discussed, no less) option from fairly early on in the book -- and the whole ride there is fun. Not as good as Excession, but definitely in my top 3-4 Culture books.
B009CPJHY4|2.0|With a host of actors associated with great performances over the years this movie proved to be a surprising disappointment. The story line is predictable, shallow and built with one dimensional characters that play all the stereotypical roles of modern Hollywood movies. Keep your expectations low.
159420411X|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  This is another book I believe should be required reading for everyone. The author weaves a story about prediction/forecasting and its limitations with a  somewhat autobiographical journey  which provides  detailed explorations of politics, economics,  sport (baseball), weather,  earthquakes, gambling (poker), climate change and more.<br /><br />The writing style is engaging, forthright, humorous as well as instructive. The  book covers the limitations of models predictive power and how deeply human the endeavour of predicting and forecasting is. It requires both deep understanding as well as statistical modelling. It is an iterative  process and needs to be open and driven by pursuit of truth.<br /><br />The insights from Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman with respect to limitations of human reason (see Thinking Fast and Slow),  the problems of assumptions (linearity for non-linear phenomena, independence in highly dependent environments, power law distributions) and  a number of forms of biases including human propensity to overconfidence, distortion of risks and closed attitude (attachment to pre-conceived notions) are discussed.  The book is not a dry technical exploration but a clear entertaining  exploration. The graphics used powerfully reinforce the narrative.<br /><br />There is overlap with the themes of Black Swan. I must admit that I prefer Nate Silver's exploration. I found the story telling more enjoyable, the arguments clearer and more convincing and the witticisms more amusing.  I did not know anything about American Baseball but enjoyed the author's passion. The perspective on Moneyball provided an insight into this complex world that was better than the somewhat simplistic movie version (I have not read the book). Similarly, I have not played poker but the chapter devoted to this was interesting both within the context of forecasting as well as an object lesson for the important theme of the deeply human endeavour of tryingto understand the world and its uncertainty.<br /><br />I am inspired after reading this book to understand more about modelling, despite an emphasis on its pitfalls.  If nothing else, I hope I am more analytical and open to information presented to me and more insightful and reflective enough to learn from my failures as well as more realistically appraise my apparent successes.

B00992CF6W|4.0|pretty good but glitchy and needs minecarts and armor also sometimes it wont let me open it so I guess its ok
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Fantastic sequel! Couldn't put it down! By far the best series since reading 50 Shades. Can't wait for the release of the 3rd.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  Lots of action and also humor.  I saw it in the movie theater twice and knew I had to have it once it was released to DVD.  I like purchasing the two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo.  I have a Blu-ray player but my cousin doesn't, so I keep the Blu-ray disc and send her the regular DVD.  Anyway, it's a great, entertaining movie.  I recommend buying it.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|If you want a book to read for fun this is entertaining. I gave it four stars because I felt it was a bit predictable. I felt the story was drawn out in the middle of the book then all of a sudden it was like the writer went into hyper drive mode and started rushing at the end of the book to tie it all together. (Which was sort of a relief because I was starting to feel depressed for the characters).
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is awesome, shows Gideon being domianant & it opens up the way for book 3 to have a more in depth story. I recommend it to everyone who liked Christian Grey & the 1st book in this series by Silva Day
B006LSZECO|3.0|Way to long .I really don't know why it was on the top 10 so long. This is book is a 6 1/2 out of 10<br />.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|5/5 that was amazing! cant wait for the next book! rick ended the book perfectly and I'm glad that there's another book. and the book series hasn't ended just yet

B0054JZC6E|4.0|Has many different games to play. Most of them are pretty easy to beat. I think they are fun although a lot of them have the same concept.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is just another weather app. It does what i want ant i dont have any issues with it at all.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I'm a Alien movie nut, I like them all, Prometheus is a good start to explaining where the Alien came from, Not a lot of the Alien in the movie but I think if they make a sequel you will see more of the Alien in it.
B000IZ8SD8|5.0|Patrick Stewart is at his &#34;Shakespearean&#34; best here, with Picard's tortured psyche on display following his rescue from the Borg.  A finely crafted script draws parallels with &#34;Moby Dick&#34;, with the Borg filling in for the white whale, and Picard, like Ahab, obsessed with vengeance; as Earth, itself is threatened by their &#34;resistance is futile&#34; maxim and power.  Jonathon Frakes directs with a deft hand...he knows these characters well.  (He has a Harvard degree, folks...no fool, that man!) The supporting cast is fine, as usual, with Marina Sirtis, as Troi stretching her comedy muscles in one scene.  The guest appearances, by James Cromwell and Alfred Woodard, also kick this film up a notch from the average Science Fiction space opera.  Finally, Stewart's finesse and passion in a Melville spouting (hee,hee) climactic scene with Woodard will have you mesmerized.  A truly fine film,  Watch it!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I enjoyed this, the first of the trilogy but I don't think I will read the other two. The book is very well written and the theme of the book is definitely not mainstream love story! I must have lived a sheltered life because I can't imagine any woman who would welcome this kind of life-style. The sex scenes (which is most of the book) were done in as tasteful manner as one could do such a thing and I must admit it was interesting to find out more about a dominant-submissive relationship. Give me the old fashioned love relationship any day!!!
1451695195|3.0|I found Eban Alexanders Proof of Heaven to be both outstanding and disappointing.  As a certified member of the scientific community, his account may open doors for understanding NDEs and acceptance of them among his peers and lay people in ways that other accounts cannot.  Not only is he a practicing neurosurgeon but received several fellowships from Harvard University, taught and researched neurosurgery at Harvard Medical School for 15 years, and has enormous experience in his field. His curriculum vita is extensive and impressive.  He presents unique credentials that will go a long way towards getting people's attention and helping bring the amazing reality of near death experiences to a much greater audience.<br /><br />He is also articulate and insightful and has a phenomenal ability to describe his illness and it's aftermath in the scientific language of neurology and related fields, together with a very welcome sense of emotion and storytelling that made Proof of Heaven a fast, entertaining and comprehensive read.<br /><br />I was disappointed, however, that the author didn't make a greater effort to articulate his experience in ways that would communicate the truly expansive, universal and international phenomena that NDEs are.  NDEs are, by their very nature, ineffable, and escape the easy descriptions of any one language or culture.  But by describing his experience in terms of \\"heaven,\\" \\"God,\\" \\"angels,\\" etc. he misses a unique opportunity to expand our understanding in more global terms, and puts a cultural fence around his experience that will keep our understanding of it locked in the merely local, parochial expressions of Alexander's own culture.<br /><br />A much better, more transcendent NDE book is Anita Moorjani's Dying to be Me.  Ms Moorjani, coming from a multicultural, multilingual environment, is sensitive to the limitations of any one culture in describing the \\"indescribable,\\" and goes to great lengths to choose words and expressions that canbe understood in a much more expansive, global and culturally inclusive way.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I enjoyed Proof of Heaven greatly and hope that it finds a very wide audience and helps raise awareness of NDEs and their insights into life here...and any afterlife that we might experience. I would recommend this book to any interested in NDE literature and what these experiences may hold for us all.

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|City of Bones<br />The Mortal Instruments Book One<br />By Cassandra Clare<br /><br />Clary Fray and her best friend Simon head out to the all ages club, Pandemonium in New York City. On this outing Clary runs into three tattooed teenagers wielding strange weapons that murder a boy, but when his body disappears into thin air Clary's mind soon goes from calling the police to making sure she makes it out alive. This is only the beginning of how Clary's world is completely shattered in the blink of the eye. The next day she is being obstinate towards her mother after being unjustly grounded when a frantic phone call from her mother takes her to her ram shackled apartment to find her mother gone and a demon waiting for her. With the help of the three teen warriors known as the Shadowhunters and her best friend Simon she will do anything she can to save her mother.<br /><br />I picked this book up through audible not too long ago thinking it sounded interesting and young adult romances are always a quick and fun read for me. What I had not anticipated was that this novel would blow me out of the water, Not only do you have a fascinating story line but then Cassandra Clare throws in one twist after another until you are left shocked and thoroughly anticipating the next installment of this series.  To add into the fun as you weave your way through the story line this novel has some of the best action scenes I have come across and the author is able to fully bring to life each instance almost making you flinch as you follow along. This was definitely a remarkable book though there was a moment when I cringed and the \\"eww\\" factor went up a few notches, but in the end it added to the fun of the book.

B009UMTMKS|5.0|Most companies fail due to lack of customers not because the technology or the product is not good enough. Steve clearly articulates how to develop customers by using amazing tools that are not taught in business schools such as the Customer Development Methodology which gives you a clear path to identify who your customers are and a repeatable Business Model that will grow your business.    I recommend this book to anyone interested in creating a successful company, I applaud at Steve's work on sharing his amazing wealth of knowledge to the world audience, he clearly is not doing it for the money as most of his resources are free and available to the world audience not just the elite    Below are a few links from Steve  [...]  [...]  [...]

B007PVHANM|5.0|Last summer I found myself wanting to own some Marley music, and purchased the soundtrack without being familiar with the DVD itself.  I enjoyed the music so much, I later came across the DVD on Netflix and watched it, all 2 and a half hours, with rapt attention.  The DVD pays tribute to his life, music, & religion.  It is full of concert footage, and goes a little bit into the history and political strife in Jamaica central to his music.  I don't normally have the patience for DVD commentary, but I was so taken by Marley's life story, I watched it a second time through with commentary by Kevin MacDonald and Ziggy Marley, and was then moved to tears by the end.  The commentary was excellent and is recommended, and creates a more intimate glimpse into Marley's life.  His life ended too young, but the joy he created lives on all over the world.  This DVD is so rich in special features you will want to spend an extra night watching them after the documentary is through.  Previously I only knew of the music from the popular songs on the radio; having watched the DVD and purchased the soundtrack has broadened my understanding of his life and his influence on the world that continues today and his legacy that will live on.
B0094U0RJQ|4.0|Tempest is a good album and I enjoy it more with each listen. I do miss the \\"old\\" Dylan but he's managed to carve out a different sort of niche with the last two offerings. We won't be hearing any large crowds singing these songs at protests any time soon, but most protesters today don't really have anything really worth showing up for, anyway. Buy it, enjoy it.
1451620829|5.0|If you are a Peter Criss follower, a 70's music lover, or just a KISS fan, you will like this book.  I really liked to read this book and I couldn't put it down.  The insight, lessons learned by a very influential drummer (and in my opinion under rated drummer and singer) from one of the top bands of the 70's and 80's was very interesting.  I thought the details were GREAT!<br /><br />Nice job Peter!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|While each part can be purchased separately, Wool 1-5 is a serial novel and not a series.  Get the omnibus - a great value and then you're not left hanging.<br /><br />Wool 1:<br />This is a wonderful short story that made me very glad there are 4 more for me to read.<br />It's a lot like a Twilight Zone episode, and could stand alone.  The world building it tidy and tight.  We know enough to get a sense of curiosity and unease, but we're not buried under too many details.<br />This was such a refreshing change of pace from the end-of-the-world books I've recently read.  Not a sprawling epic, and no teen yearning for love amid the ruins of civilization.  Just a man and a mystery, and a view.<br />******<br />Wool 2:<br />Part 2 was just as good as part 1. I love this author, because so far he has been able to build worlds and characters efficiently and effectively.<br />I've been wondering why some authors are so good at that, and others take whole series and hundreds (or thousands) of pages and don't have much to show for it in terms of depth. All I can come up with is that for the successful, the people and places are real. They are fully formed in the author's mind already, so when the details are presented to the reader we also get a sense of completeness. We know there is more there, and likely more to be revealed, without a lot of extra effort.<br /><br />I found every single page of part 2 interesting, and am looking forward to part 3.<br />*******<br />Wool 3:<br />What a bang of a start and finish. I raced through this installment at breakneck pace.<br />Same as before - great writing, everything moves along speedily, and you real feel for the characters.<br />On to part 4!<br /><br />******<br />Wool 4:<br />Another excellent installment.  We get a bigger view of the Wool world, and it does not disappoint.  We get a lot of answers in this book, and of course more questions.  Totally compelling.<br /><br />******<br />Wool 5:<br />A fantastic conclusion toone of the best dystopian novels I've ever read.  Tons of tension, and a very satisfying finish.<br /><br />Overall - This is a near perfect marriage of character, world, and plot-building.  Nothing is sacrificed for the other.<br />I've read a lot of dystopian fiction recently, and in so many cases the main character is unbelievable.  Too much luck, too perfect, etc.  Somehow Howey manages to keep his characters grounded through multiple insane situations.  I never lost the thread of the narrative.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|When this movie came out on the theaters everyone I knew wanted to see it so that means that saw it like 6 or 7 times. I never grew tire of watching it. The effects are good and the action is awesome, I still laugh every time I watch it. I bought the 4 disc combo at $19.99 and it was an awesome offer, for I got my dad the $21.99 2 disc combo that comes with the bubble head....I never gave him the bubble head...
034580404X|5.0|Fascinating tale of two people from very different backgrounds who find common ground in order to stay together. A unique love story that tugs at your heart.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|This is Kristen Stewarts best movie ever....she gets her butt kicked, dies, and only says a few lines. Now, Charlize Theron is the star of the movie. Her acting was the best of them all. Still, it does not hurts either that Chris Hemsworth looks hot even when drunk and muddy.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|its a great way to past the time at work. and also my kids love the game... hope u come out with more games
B009439HEY|5.0|A previous comment mentioned the word 'rediscovery' and that was exactly the word I was looking for.  This material is just too good to fade into memory and Steve Hackett has proven to be just the right person to once again bring new life to the most exciting and fertile time in the life of one of our most treasured progressive groups. The clarity and precision brought to this collection is stunning. If you've been in the camp that champions the era of Genesis that originally presented this material, Genesis Revisited II will reconnect you with the younger version of yourself who thought \\"it just doesn't get any better than this.\\"  If a later -  or merely casual -  Genesis fan, here's a path to their rich and majestic past that will encourage further exploration. Genesis Revisited II is the real deal. Steve's done us all proud.
B008XG1X18|5.0|thanks so much!! on my fire and droid 3. sometimes lags on loading on my fire but love it none the less!  on it all the time! maybe a few more guy things, it definitely seems more geared for women. target market and all :)

Immediately when I finish I when back to revisit a few segments!!!!!!<br />What an awesome book, even better than the first.<br />Can't wait till next year for the third one, ahhh<br />Hands down Ms. Day you are so incredibly good.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|Scott is a great visual storyteller, and Prometheus is yet one more illustration of this.  Even Scott's less popular films like 'Legend' demonstrate his uncanny ability to put a world on the screen that is engrossing and believable and delicious to observe.  The story of Prometheus is a bit of a head-scratcher, raising as many questions as answers in this prequel to 'Alien', but the film is satisfying, nonetheless, for it's sheer visual impact.
B009GI8J1O|3.0|Have not finished the book yet. So far is a slow read... seems disconnected and not near as good writing skills as expected.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|It was terrific to watch, but disappointing about the ads.  Why do we have to watch ads on a DVD that we purchase?  The other disappointing thing was the way each episode began.  It was difficult to see just which one we were up to.  However, the series is fantastic.
B007OWRBJK|4.0|I've been a Who fan for a long time, but after the band \\"broke up\\" in the early eighties.<br /><br />Townshend's songs are often autobiographical, so this book is a natural.  Townshend writes a very personal biography that seems laced together by clusters of feelings, thoughts, and factual information.  The material shifts from compelling to amusing to uncomfortable over and over again.<br /><br />The only thing Pete Townshend ends up discussing in the book in any depth is the interior life of Pete Townshend: his struggles for acceptance, understanding, and successful relationships.  Ultimately, his book seems cathartic for the author, just like his music.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I purchased this for my 11 year old son.  He had been anxiously waiting for its release.  When it finally arrived he read it in two days and loved it.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|This movie did not disappoint. Perfect pre-quell to Alien.  The visual effects are absolutely stunning. Fassbender, Theron, Rapuse are brilliant actors.
B007OWRBJK|5.0|First this book is so far from being a standard Pete Townshend bio that if you know little to nothing about the band you might want to start with [[ASIN:1847727042 Who Are You: The Life Of Pete Townshend]] to get an idea of the general time line of his life and work with The Who. The two books companion well. A general history of The Who can be found in [[ASIN:B000YFPTSE Amazing Journey: The Story of The Who 3-DVD Exclusive Edition]]<br /><br />This book concentrates on Pete's memories and feelings about events in his life, how they affected him, the songs they created. It may be music that saved Pete's life after a terrible childhood he felt defenseless to fight against. Once he discovered he could write good songs Pete set out to change the world but felt let down when I Can See For Miles did not change the world as he expected. Again his life was saved with the discovery of Meher Baba and his spiritual influence from Tommy onward.<br /><br />Much of the time in the book is spent on the late seventies-early eighties after Keith Moon's death, the women in Pete's life at the time, and his relationship with his wife Karen. Hard core Wholigans will get more clues to who inspired \\"Somebody Saved Me\\" and \\"Athena\\" but he clearly says Karen is the inspiration for \\"A Little is Enough\\". After his solo albums it seemed Pete was done with touring. Tours like the 1989 Tommy reunion, 1996 Quadrophenia, and the those that ran through the end of John Entwistle's life were taken up for the sake of his band mates and others even if they did introduce the assets of drummer Zak Starkey and younger brother Simon Townshend.<br /><br />Pete's 2003 arrest and the fall out are covered and dealt with honestly. By the time you've read up to that part of the book you understand what happened and why. If you're reading this book you're already a Pete/Who fan and you'll be left appreciating the musical gifts he's given us and be willing o overlook the faults.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|This time Follett impressed me not only by his ability to involve so many good characters in one great plot, but also by bringing so many realistic details about such a dark period of human history. My husband reads a lot about WWII and was also impressed by the accurate information, of course it isn't a history book but a very well written historical novel!
B008NEMN0K|3.0|First, I must qualify my equipment; top shelf equipment was only used for this review. Secondly, I am a fan of Will Smith and specifically am a fan of the movie, \\"I Robot\\". I already owned the initial DVD, then Blu-Ray and now the 3D Blu-Ray release of this movie. Needless to say, I had been waiting anxiously for this converted 2D - 3D version to arrive!<br /><br />Having already experienced the gold standard for 3D Blu-Ray releases, \\"Avatar\\" I am fully aware of the capabilities of the 3D experience Blu-Ray can provide. I have a high expectation of what to expect in a 2D to 3D conversion and was hoping \\"I Robot\\" would be another wonderful visual experience! However, the gamble Fox has taken in using the new cheaper and less time consuming JVC Kenwood 2D3D workstation is one based solely upon the opinion the average consumer will not know the difference with a more realistic, but time-consumming process such as employed by Legend 3D (\\"Hugo\\",\\" Transformers: Dark of the Moon\\", \\"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides\\", \\"The Amazing Spider-Man\\", \\"Shrek\\", and others). In a word, I was very disappointed!<br /><br />It was P.T. Barnum who supposedly said, \\"You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.\\" I think this was the basis of Fox's final decision to use the JVC Kenwood process.<br /><br />All business must make a calculated decision regarding their bottom line. The quality of a final product along with the time to market are part of any business equation.  With Fox's plans to release more movies in this pseudo 3D format, it appears their return on investment (ROI) has trumped their use of a higher quality conversion process.<br /><br />Most higher quality products requires a skilled artisan's trained eye and hands, just like a quality crafted gilded chair. Such a beautiful object simply takes time and higher quality wood and materials. However, a cheap chair churnedout in an overseas factory, using the cheapest of materials doesn't require skilled labor. Such are the products infesting our nation today. However, quality takes time and time is money.<br /><br />So far, I have been writing metaphorically and I promise to be more specific shortly. But, when discussing how we perceive our senses, it is oftentimes best to use such a method to get one's idea across.<br /><br />For example, would you prefer an aged Kentucky whiskey that has been aged in wooden barrels for the past 12 years, or one produced last month and is already in your glass? Or, would you prefer a Michael Angelo original painting or Elvis on velvet from a street vendor in a foreign country?<br /><br />Unfortunately, we have been conditioned to oftentimes think something cheaper is somehow better. But, we all know we oftentimes get what we pay for.<br /><br />In the case of this movie, it is still a good story, with great actors. But, behind the scenes, Fox took the cheapest road to market and it shows!<br /><br />Specifics; throughout the movie there are many glaring instances in which the perceived depth was shown as if there were flat objects placed at various distances from the camera. It reminded me of the cardboard popups in the TCM movie opening sequences in which various movie characters would pop up from the pages of a book when it was opened to a different page.<br /><br />In this movie, you have \\"flat\\" characters and objects placed at different distances from the camera, or point of reference. There are also absolutely no \\"screen pop\\" experiences as there are in \\"Avatar\\". The depth shown in \\"John Carter 3D\\" and \\"Titanic\\" was very impressive. The depth in this movie was also adequately simulated. But, the characters in the other movies referenced possessed realistic curvatures and shapes and were not simply placed within space as a \\"flat\\" cutout cardboard character.<br /><br />When discussing spatial issues it is oftentimes difficult to express sensoryexperiences, as we all process and interpret what our senses tells us a little bit differently than others. What may be noticeable to me may be missed by others. Some people will \\"perceive\\" the depth simulated in this movie as being lifelike, when in my opinion this is not how I perceive my world around me!<br /><br />It is perhaps this difference Fox is banking upon. Perhaps they're hoping enough potential customers will not notice these spatial and optical qualitative differences and will therefore continue to pay a premium price for a movie they probably already have in their collection, like I do. It is an effective way to continue to harvest the gems they have in their vaults. Or, if you prefer; they will continue to milk the same cash cow until she runs dry! I have no objections to this, as long as I feel I am getting my money's worth!<br /><br />Fox has a wonderful and historical film library which includes many gems yet to be released on any format and many I'd wish to own. But, in the future, I will be more cautious of any future Fox 3D Blu-Ray 2D-3D conversion releases if they continue using the JVC Kenwood process. Unless they significantly improve this process, I will probably look for more releases by other studios using the Legend 3D process, or of movies shot in real 3D. It is a shame they decided to take the cheaper route.<br /><br />I would hope others would gladly have paid a premium for the better quality processes, just as I would. Quality craftsmanship still means something to me. Does it to you too?
B004PIKPTY|4.0|It's an amazing headset when it comes to gaming although you gotta play with the mixer and the options in order to get that quality sound you expected
B009NQKXYK|3.0|There were so high expectations from this movies but I felt it was not up to the mark. As I didn't understand what was the purpose of the big face shown. From where the Alien came. They never told what happened to the male scientist, no explanations on that.<br />Still from the movie it was not clear about what \\"big things have small beginning\\" after seeing contents of the cylindrical container. I think time are gone when audience were happy to see high graphics space ships, other planets and life there. Now I feel the story should be very strong which should be also scientifically true and explained.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I had hoped to sit and enjoy this book in one sitting - and was not disappointed! This book reminded me of The Firm. It had that kind of flavor, strategy, and mystery. Best of all - I was halfway through the book before I even started to catch on to what was actually happening. This book is the reason I read Grisham. If you enjoyed reading his early legal thrillers, I recommend this book - as it has all the mojo of those days gone by.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It helps me choose what to wear or to gain inspiration for dinner. It is surprisingly just as easy to use on my kindel as it is on my computer.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This is one movie that you wished that it would not end. I will admit that it dragged a little at the beginning, but after a few minuets , I couldn't believe that it was almost over. Each character was well presented as they had been originally shown from their comic book.<br />The action scenes were outstanding. Special effects will either make or ruin a movie, this is one that was without a doubt a HIT.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I wish all movies came in this packaging.  DVD, Blu-ray, 3D and Digital download.  Until we get players standardized this is the best option.  One format for the car (DVD), one for the house (Blu-ray) and the digital download for just about anything else.  The 3D is nice if that's what you are looking for too.

B005QPMB2Y|4.0|I purchased this 3 weeks ago so that I could keep an eye on my pets and pet-sitter while I was away.  I purchased one camera and now plan to purchase another one for another area of my home. I paid $40 for the Foscam tech support to remotely install it.  My cable company made it somewhat difficult to select the correct port and the Foscam tech did it in less than 15 minutes using Team Viewer on my pc. I suggest having the Team Viewer (free) program on your pc before you use tech support if you need to use tech support.  I highly recommend this camera for anyone who would want to view their home while away. It is simple to use and allows you to hear sounds at your home, can pan the viewer to see a wide range. While it is supposed to allow you to speak and be heard at your home while away, that feature did not work well...have to call Foscam to find out why. It is good for one room and is not the type of camera that one typically hides from view, although it can be.  It worked perfectly via my cell phone, laptop and Kindle Fire.  Great deal!
1904265790|4.0|\\"Judge Dredd: Complete Case Files v. 1\\" is a collection of the first stories starring Judge Dredd, the venerable English comic book hero, who has been in print, in one form or another, for well over 30 years.  For the most part the series is set in the future in 2099, in Mega City 1 (nominally New York City).  Judge Dredd is the most well-known (and most feared) of the Street Judges, lawmen who are empowered to arrest, judge, and sentence anyone they find guilty of a crime.  Each story runs to a maximum of about 8 pages (due to the fact that they originally ran in a weekly science fiction anthology), although some of the episodes link together in a broader story arc.<br /><br />These stories, particularly at the beginning of the book, are a little heavy-handed and simplistic, although the same can be said for most of the first few issues of \\"classic\\" comic books starring other characters.  However, over the course of this first collection, the character of Judge Dredd and his world are fleshed out more and more, and the stories point to the familiar characterizations and complex plot-lines to come.  That's not to say that this book is not entertaining or worth reading, but if you started reading within the last 10 or 20 years (heh), then these stories a perhaps a little on the primitive side when compared to the more recent comics.<br /><br />Judge Dredd is not very likeable, but his moral compass for right and wrong is unwavering, and at times, it's intentionally too unwavering.  The tales have humor, pathos, irony, and a lot of action.  If you're a Judge Dredd fan, this collection should be on your bookshelf.  Four stars.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|I don't understand why the reviews for this movie are so terrible. It seemed to me like a very good movie minus the cheesily-designed horses. I would definitely watch it again though; it had some amazing fight scenes and a good story in my opinion. Decently accurate historically minus the whole vampire thing haha.
B0091VGAXK|3.0|The movie is fun, in the \\"stupid but funny\\" way, kinda like Dumb and Dumber. Characters are over the top and do ridiculous things but it makes you laugh. What really hurts the movie is that it goes a little too hardcore. It may have worked better if it were more family-friendly. Instead we have strippers who dont show the goods. Female fans and groupies showing the goods but the camera not peeking. Men kissing each other. Seriously, this movie doesn't know what it wants to be. Either go full blown \\"R\\" and give the adults what they want, or soften it up and get the parents to buy tickets for their kids. Instead its just a tease and pisses everyone off.<br /><br />Anyways, Tom Cruise steals the show with his Stacie Jaxx character, who really is the main player in the movie. Everyone and everything revolves around this character in the movie from the two main characters moving to LA, The survival of the club, etc. The two \\"main stars\\" of the movie (Julianne Hugh and Diego Bolenta) are basically there to show how Stacie Jaxx got so f'ed up and the poor decisions he made, so I see the importance of their parts. Other characters could be cut altogether and nobody would notice. The main problem with this movie is that its WAY too long. Over 2 hours? Really? First of all, we can get rid of the Mayor and Catherine Zeta Jones character completely. That would cut out a solid 15-20 minutes. Those story lines are not needed at all and waste time. Russell Brand isnt needed either. Im not even sure why he is there other than to give Alec Baldwin someone to talk to? Brand would have another 10 minutes or so cut from the film. That would take it to 90-100 minutes. More doable, and nothing would change!<br /><br />Watch the movie for the cool soundtrack and Tom Cruise as Stacie Jaxx. If you have seen him in Tropic Thunder then you know how awesome Cruise can be in these over-the-top characters.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|I love Animated Batman, so I am prejudiced. The return follows much of the Batman canon, but is only the beginning.<br />  I want the rest now!<br />  The animation is well done.<br />  The backgrounds and music are dark and set the tone of wretched Gotham beset by entrenched evil.<br />  It's clear that The Batman realized he had a monumental chore ahead of him.<br />  This is fun!
B005LAIHY0|2.0|The script is weak, very weak. First of all, a space exploration like this would have the crew actually meet before the voyage. Probably under go training for months and months to actually know the ins-and-outs of the ship they will be living on for the next few years. Instead, they wake up, not knowing who is on the ship, and introduce themselves. Really? Then we get inept scientists. We have a biologists talking to a snake-looking creature like its a puppy and going to rollover and play fetch with him. DUDE, THIS IS A DAMN ALIEN AND YOU'RE STANDING IN A ROOM WITH A CORPSE!!! There is also a geologist (rock expert) who brings with him cool mapping droids that map caves out by themselves, and HE gets lost in the cave. A geologist with mapping droids gets lost in a cave.  A GE-OL-O-GIST gets LOST in a CAVE. Really?  Really? Movies like these can at least make their fodder characters a little bit more realistic. And when a giant donut shaped ship is rolling like a tire and going to crush you, dont keep running in a straight line! Take a 90 degree turn, jog a couple steps out the way, and let in roll on by. Damn, people! Oh and get this, they were actually outrunning the donut ship until they TRIP AND FALL. Really? We need the \\"trip and fall\\" scenario like we are watching Friday the 13th?<br /><br />For all the stupidity in this movie, Im still a sucker for sci-fi movies, and this one does have some cool stuff in it. I loved the cave mapping droids. The doctor capsule, and just the overall exploring alien planets. If the characters were actually capable of their professions, this could have been a great movie. Instead, only watch it if youre a huge sci-fi fanatic. Otherwise, watch Alien again and enjoy the awesomeness.

0525958002|5.0|A fantastic book!<br /><br />I confess to having been a huge Duran Duran as a teen and continue to follow the band. Having said that, this book would be a great read not only for Duranies, but for anyone who is a fan of pop culture. John does an excellent job of laying out the timeline of the popular music and influences throughout his youth and career. I am a huge music fan so it was fun to revisit all of the great bands and styles of the late 70's and early 80's.<br /><br />It was very interesting to read about the ups and downs of life in the band from his perspective and how deeply the drugs and alcohol impaired his journey.<br /><br />John is an excellent writer and a great story teller. This book was written with class - it is clear he deliberately took the high road. For someone who has given so much of himself for so long to his fans, I think we can all understand his wanting to save parts of his story for himself.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I do like Jetpack Joyride; but it is not as addicting as my friends tell me. I really like it! It is very fun and I play it often. I recommend it; especially if you like Fruit Ninjas! (Since it is made by the same creator's)

B0063IH60K|5.0|its great! better than computer solitaire! I love the auto complete option, its quick, and its so easy to use.
B005HEX1AK|4.0|Yes, the plot is quite familiar, but I found the relationship between Chakotay and Captain Janeway quite touching in this episode. I was wondering if there would ever be another reference to the time when they were really close due to their being stranded alone together on a planet. The little scene between past Janeway and  future Neelix is sweet as well. Tuvok gets to say his heartfelt tribute to the Captain in a death scene in a possible past. I do not grade Trek too hard on believe-ability, because, after all, it is science FICTION.  I love Voyager because of the characters and the creativity of many of the plots. After so many years of not being able to see the show, I am so glad to have them back, commercial free. They have become my TV family when I am alone. Special thanks to Kate Mulgrew for giving me a character I affectionately admire. I wish I could adopt Janeway as my sister :)<br />Best lines: Janeway :...You seem to get to know me quite well. Just how close do we get?\\"<br />Chakotay: \\"Let's just say there are some barriers we do not cross.\\"

1559409002|5.0|I just recd my criterion carnival of souls w prompt delivery. and it made my night!<br /><br />Like many fans i first saw on tv in the 1970s and have never forgotten it. i did pick up later in 90s and i still recall it bein called CORRIDORS OF EVIL on that release. thankfully that title didnt stick  !  im THRILLED to finally have directors cut of this film. its too bad these scenes didnt make it into theatrical release as they added a little more punch to the puzzle.<br /><br />the special features on both dvds are numerous and as a true fan of this film i enjoyed them. this movie is one-of-a kind and finally getting praise it well deserves. its unfortunate that the distribution company did a poor job in 1962 as herk harvey wd have been financially able2 continue making films. But to quote candace hilligoss: BETTER LATE THAN NEVER!<br /><br />this is an enchantingy creepy cult classic and the organ music throughout adds to the erie overall effect! so happy i have this gem to add to my collection! 5 STARS!
B000003N7K|5.0|This one is like VSOP brandy, the finest champagne, the richest Bordeaux...enters you smooth and cool/warm...explodes heat in your belly and leaves you an ADDICT.<br /><br />There has been no one like Hartman since, and in a world which has deified the likes of 50 Cent and Jay-Z, I doubt anyone would bother to listen if he were still singing.<br /><br />And I don't doubt that Coltrane's music will soon be used to sell the latest Infiniti.<br /><br />This is not bedroom/date music.  Listen at your own risk, and listen alone.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Maybe the worst John Grisham legal thriller ever....<br /><br />I've read all of his law-related books, and they have, in my opinion, just gotten worse over the years.  None are as good as his first few books.  This one tries to capture some of the thrill of The Firm, but just isn't as engaging.<br /><br />I had a very hard time getting into the book, had to force myself to finish it.<br />It did get better, but still did not match my expectations.

1250004217|2.0|\\"Bertrand pocketed his phone at last and turned his attention to me.  He gave me one of his irresistible grins.  Why did I have such an impossibly attractive husband?...If silver hair and wrinkles seemed to highlight Bertrand's beauty, I felt sure they diminished mine.\\"<br /><br />With lines like this riddling the book, Sarah's Key would seem to be a romance novel along the lines of something that might have a shirtless Fabio adorning the cover.  Unfortunately, the author couldn't seem to decide whether she was writing a bad romance novel, or an interesting but far too brief story about a young girl and her family during the roundup of French Jews in 1942.  The story of young Sarah (whose name is kept a secret for almost half the book even though her name is in the book title.  Huh?)  is touching, but the chapters dedicated to telling that story alternate with the completely inane chapters about Julia in the present day.<br /><br />The character of Julia Jarmond and her actions, to me, were utterly laughable.  Her \\"growth\\" as a character was so contrived and ridiculous that I couldn't help but laugh out loud most of the time.  The predictable ending and \\"surprise\\" at the end were the most laughable of all. Thank goodness the chapters are so short that the book reads much shorter than its length due to the resulting blank spaces on many pages.<br /><br />The fact that I was educated about a historical event that I was not previously aware of is the one and only reason why I was able to give Sarah's Key anything more than a 1-star rating.  If you want to be educated, avoid Sarah's Key and read a non-fiction book without the unlikable characters, cliches, and poor writing.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|This game got me hooked with the free version. I went ahead & bought the deluxe game -something I don't normallydo.  Lots of fun & challenge.
0525953728|5.0|Excellent. It was good to have a first hand account of the killing of BinLaden. I hear so many different accounts on T.V. & read about it by people who have no idea what really happened, it was great to have an actual account of what really happened in very distinct detail.  I have passed the book on to others to read. We need to pass on a BIG thank you to all our military & to our Navy Seals. It is sad that so many  people in Washington take credit for accomplishments that they had no real involvement at all.

0887081770|3.0|That this is the mini version of the book :) I'm writing this review just in case there's another impulsive shopper out there (like me) that doesn't check the dimensions of the book before purchasing. This is a very small version and while still an amazing and interactive book, it's just not as much fun as the larger version. I returned this one immediately and purchased the larger version.
B0018RWD5O|5.0|This marvelous creation by John Coltrane is one of THE true highlights of my enormous (> 800) CD collection.  I love many types of music,  but when it comes to eloquent jazz saxophone,  Mr. Coltrane is right at the top.  The only other CD I have that has Mr. Coltrane as the leader is his magnificent \\"A Love Supreme\\",  but what a fabulous pair of musical compilations both of the bodies of musical work are.  The \\"Cresent\\" CD arrived after having only been on order for about 10 days.  Talk about early Christmas present to ones self!!!

B0038BBA4I|5.0|Great songs and performances. I had been hearing Little Lion Man on the radio and digging it but the DJ's would never name the group. I finally went on Amazon, searched for folk music, and started clicking on 30 second clips until I found it. The rest of the songs on this album are just as good...
B000EHSVS2|5.0|I originally saw this movie on Patton several years ago on Television.I thoroughly liked it up until the ending. The original movie showed how he died, this movie cut short of showing that event. His belief of having been reborn several times over as a military man gives my own opinion on that subject of having been reborn.In the original movie they show his wife toward the end of the movie supporting him, in this they also have cut it out of the movie. Could you imagine had he lived and been transferred to the Pacific war zone how much conflict there would have been between him and MacArthur? Who knows, if he had been transferred, between the two of them they could have ended the War without the need of the BOMBS. I guess that is one that will never be known.
B007JNWQZS|4.0|This is a fantastic way to get your hands on a high quality version of these movies. Do not expect any booklets or special features. It's just the movies, not that I am complaining at this price point. I also enjoy the saved shelf space by putting both parts in one box.

B008AT71WI|5.0|This blu-ray comes with a full color booklet on the movie, a note from director Frank Oz, and the movie. The movie looks and sounds fantastic in this blu-ray edition and the restoration of the original ending is a great treat for fans. I am very satisfied. :)
B0038P59A0|3.0|If you want to enjoy this movie, don't watch the BBC series \\"Sherlock\\" first. That show is so smart, witty, and intriguing, that everything else-- this movie included-- seems contrived. It's entertaining and funny in its own right, but it lacks the genius of Arthur Conan Doyle and the story writers at the BBC. If you're looking for a worthwhile and faithful Sherlock Holmes, save your money and watch \\"Sherlock\\".

B008220DIC|4.0|The Master is a divisive film, and oddly enough not so much so for its content (or lack thereof depending on whom you're speaking to), but rather for the way the content is presented. It's one of those films that seems to leave little middle ground for people: they either want to see it again or wish they'd never spent time on it to begin with. Much like writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's last film, There Will Be Blood, The Master is a character driven piece, but The Master moves at a much more languid pace and has a less defined and dramatic conclusion for its two male leads than Blood. Nevertheless, I found The Master an equally compelling film.<br /><br />The Master takes on big subjects like religion/cult, truth, love, acceptance, purpose, and reincarnation. The audience experiences these subjects via the post-WWII relationship between two very interesting, very angry men: Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix). Dodd is a middle-aged author and leader of a growing organization known as The Cause, and Quell is an alcoholic ex-sailor drifting through his life after the war. The performances are gripping, and Anderson does a wonderful job of showing the audience these two men rather than telling us about them. Of course, this isn't a documentary, so Anderson isn't obligated to be unbiased as to what or how he shows the audience. This makes for gripping, thought provoking cinema.
0385535147|5.0|Malcolm Bannister is a disbarred lawyer who has perhaps been wrongfully imprisoned for money-laundering.  He was caught up in a web of deceit spun by an east coast wannabe power broker and convicted by overzealous U.S. government agencies who cared not one whit about the lives it was about to destroy.<br /><br />Malcolm has had five years in prison to consider his plight and plan what he can do to shorten his ten-year sentence.  When a federal judge is murdered in rural Virginia Malcolm knows his plan is starting to unfold.  He knows who killed the judge even though he was locked up miles away from the murder scene.<br /><br />Though the main character is a former lawyer \\"The Racketeer\\" is not the typical Grisham book about law firms and how they work.  At its heart this is a page-turner of a murder mystery rolled into a \\"caper\\" book.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  This may be the best Grisham book in several years.
B009MF56GC|4.0|This is the film I expected the first Sly Stallone led action ensemble to be, and it's one of the rare sequels that outdoes the original film. The plot is paper thin, the acting questionable, and the dialogue meh; however, the `splosions are big, the a$$kickery is set at near maximum, and the body counts are in the triple digits. If you love the overblown action films of the 1980s then Expendables 2 is your kind of movie.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|The boys are back to fighting big baddies. Love the campy humor. Love the characters and their relationships while they battle for good.
B005LAII80|4.0|There has been no shortage of action films lately where the plot revolves around characters surviving an urban high-rise apartment building full of obstacles: zombies in 'The Horde,' aliens in 'Attack the Block,' and drug lords in 'The Raid: Redemption.' 'Dredd' has the same conceit (except this one is set in a post-apocalyptic future) yet never feels like it is trite or clichéd. The action sequences looked spectacular in 3D. Lena Hedey is under used as the evil drug lord, but Karl Urban plays the titular Dredd with muted bada$$ness throughout. And it's Olivia Thirlby, as the rookie cop with an edge, that undergoes \\"the heroes journey\\" in the film and gave perhaps the best performance. 'Dredd' is a quality, solid action film that won't disappoint fans of the genre and a worthy addition to any home film collection.
B006H3MIV8|4.0|I bought the 4 set of CDs because I really like Bob Dylan songs and lyrics.  This is a very interesting mix of artists. I'm not generally a country music fan but I felt that the country singers did the best job with his songs.  As a baby boomer, I was not familiar with many of the the artists that perfomred on this CD, but my 26 year old son was.  This may be a fun CD for a young, open minded music lover to be introduced to Bob Dylan's music & amazing lyrics.  It was also nice for me to be introduced to some of the newer singers.  All and all, if you are an open minded music lover and you like Bob Dylan songs, you will come to like most of the renditions of the songs after you listen a few times.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|We use this to download videos that will entertain our little one when we are in restaurants and such.  We have become the envy of many parents.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan has done it yet again. Another amazing storyline that leaves you hanging on the edge. How Riordan has been able to keep the story new and interesting while putting a spin on Greek mythology amazes me. This book goes to the top of my top ten for this year and most likely next year as well!!  This is a great book whether or not your in to Greek mythology.

B008JMKN4Y|3.0|When I first started reading Beautiful Disaster, I loved it.  Big Man on Campus finds the one girl who seems immune to his charm and since he can't shag her, befriends her.  Abby and Travis develop a lovely camaraderie, with hints of attraction and unresolved sexual tension, a friendship that serves them both well.  The descriptions of campus life were fun and made me a little nostalgic for something I never actually experienced.  The author dropped hints that Abby's life before was quite different from the life she is leading on campus, said prior life being pretty much her sole reason for resisting Travis' advances in the first place.  Travis is in a fraternity, but is most assuredly not your typical frat boy, by far.<br /><br />That love for this book lasted until Abby and Travis finally give in after a fraternity party and sleep with each other.  You know it's just a matter of time, that it is going to happen, because this is a romance, right?  Big Man on Campus Travis, the guy that all the girls are hot for, the guy that girls line up to go home with, doesn't even last five minutes, and makes no effort to satisfy Abby, sexually speaking.  I can blame this on the author, because the entire episode lasted about a paragraph, but I still lost a little bit of the hero-love and respect I'd been lavishing on Travis.  After that, I just couldn't see him the same way.  By the way, the descriptions of the sex, while extremely mild and unsatisfying, were nevertheless graphic enough that I probably wouldn't suggest this for someone under fifteen to eighteen, depending on your personal line in the sand.<br /><br />Even once they were sleeping together, things went pretty well for the couple, and they were happy for a little while.  The big obstacle happens when Abby, her friend America, America's boyfriend Shep and Abby's Travis go to Las Vegas.  It all goes downhill from there.  Travis' reaction to the obstacle is just exactly wrong, and his inability or unwillingness to read Abby's body language about how important this is to her takes him even further down in my eyes.  I also don't think much of Abby's unwillingness to tell Travis why this is so critical to her.<br /><br />The resolution of this issue takes up pretty much the rest of the book, with Abby standing firm the vast majority of the time, and Travis spiraling down into what amounts to stalker territory.  I was deeply disappointed by the change in Travis from the beginning of the book to the end, and felt like he was not even the same character.  The book ends on a high note, but it was an unrealistic ending for me, too happy too soon with not enough effort on either of the characters' parts.<br /><br />I did love the characterization, particularly of Travis' family when we meet them.  Their immediate acceptance of Abby as one of them is really sweet, and the brotherly love and protectiveness is something she needs, I think, from men who aren't her boyfriend.  America and Shep stand up on their own, and even the tertiary characters aren't cookie-cutter background characters for the most part.<br /><br />I'm trying so hard here to review this book without saying what happens, because it's a big deal to the characters.  I hope I've managed that.  The first half to two-thirds of the book is really good, so I still recommend reading it.  Your mileage may vary with the big deal and the group's reaction to it, so don't let me keep you from reading the book.<br /><br />Though I did love more than half the book, my lack of connection to Travis as the book went forward colored my like enough to take it down a notch.  I'd give it a 3.5, but it definitely lost more than a point in my view.  There were mistakes which could have been either typos or formatting errors, and there were many places where capital letters should have been and weren't.
B000000WFU|4.0|I purchased this CD based on reviews, and I am happy I did. It is a deep mixture of classical and new age influence, woven together into a set of moods that invite the listener to become submerged in the composer's ideas. Well worth listening to.

B004SIP8W0|5.0|I had no idea it would even be possible to make a film that dealt with the Holocost with a sense of humor, but Benigni does it.  A story of love, family and sacrifice through the lens of WWII, specifically the concentration camps.  I recommend this movie to anyone who has never seen a foreign language film.  It will certainly be a pleasent surprise.
0062183591|3.0|After enjoying Dan Ariely's two previous books, I did not hesitate to buy The Honest Truth About Dishonesty. Sadly, although this book similarly consists of anecdotes and the interesting conclusions they lead to, it is a little bit disappointing - the anecdotes are less exciting and the conclusions less surprising.<br /><br />For the most part of the book, the author describes just a few experimental setups, which are repeated with minor variations to prove a hypothesis, often one which seems quite obvious, such as that students cheat less when they are monitored, or that they prefer to steal food than cash from a common refrigerator.<br /><br />Despite some interesting observations, like that people cheat more when they wear fake designer apparel or the \\"what-the-hell effect\\" (once you've cheated, you will cheat more), I was skeptical about some of the author's results as he doesn't describe any details of his experiments - sample size, exact outcomes and so on, which makes him seem jump to easy conclusions, even though this might not be the case.<br /><br />Another disappointing aspect is that Ariely offers few ways to counter the types of dishonest behaviour he describes - he usually leaves less than half a page at the end of each chapter for that.<br /><br />I have to admit that my impression of the book was heavily affected by the book I've finished just before - Daniel Kahneman's \\"Thinking, Fast and Slow\\". The two books sometimes describe the same phenomena and even refer to the same sources, but Kahneman's analysis goes way deeper into details, while Dan Ariely's conclusions seem superfluous, but would still make a good topic for a watercooler conversation.<br /><br />With its mix of research, readers' emails and life stories, The Honest Truth About Dishonesty offers not too much insight into the psychology of deceit, but is still an easy and pleasurable weekend's read.

B0067EKY9K|4.0|I wasn't really sure what to expect, but decided to watch because of its high ranking. Giving details would take away from the journey of discovery viewers will experience. I found the ending very satisfying.
0307719774|4.0|I was rather disappointed that it was smaller that I imagined it to be.  There also isn't much room to write your answers to the questions.  I guess I am more wordy that the book allows for.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was extremely disappointed in this book. I had heard so many great things about it prior to reading and I'm starting to wonder if I read the same book as everyone else who loved it so much. I found the author to be extremely repetitive in her descriptions. She uses the same adjectives over and over again, it's like your reading the same scene every 5 pages. The storyline was extremely predictable. The \\"romance\\" scenes were unrealistic and unimaginitive. The editing is poor, there are spelling mistakes littered throughout the novel. Overall I would not recommend it. I'm amazed that it's done so well and that people are actually reading all three books.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|I love Legend of the Seeker, so when it came in the mail, two days before it was to arrive I was impressed! I can't tell you which season I like more, they are both amazing!

B005U9PHK4|2.0|In this season, there are too many sexually &#34;intimate&#34; scenes without the ethical glue to hold the series together.  It's a miss.
B007THA4FI|3.0|A Casual Vacancy left a rather morbid impression on what daily life in Pagford and the Fields is like; from abusive & neglectful parents, cheating spouses, unruly teenagers this book covered different facets of daily life in the small, rural English town.  There's definitely no real plot to speak of, it's just a very interesting character study of how vile & petty people can be. If it were any other author, I'm not sure I would have given as high a rating, however, it gets 3-STARS mainly because it's JK-freakin'-Rowling.
B005PK55BE|2.0|I don't like Season three at all. However, this review won't be submitted until I have typed the madatory amount of words. There it is.  I'm in!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|*** Some Spoilers ***<br /><br />Watched the DVD, not the Blu-Ray (3D or regular) yet but this film is the best Sci-Fi film to come out in MANY years. It works on all levels as a standalone movie, as Ridley Scott says it is, or pseudo prequel to Alien.<br /><br />Honestly, I love Ridley Scott, but I have a couple of small harsh comments about his statements. Either he is lying about it being a sequel to Alien OR he thinks most movie watchers are blithering idiots. WHY was this on a moon and not a planet as in Alien, Why were the original aliens planting eggs inside humans, why did the alien ship look EXACTLY like the alien ship found in alien and WHY did the final alien look almost identical to the aliens in Alien, maybe they morph as in this film. There are so many unanswered questions. That's why there is already a sequel being made.<br /><br />Loved it! Can't wait to see the Blu-Ray and all 7 hours of extras!
B005S570FA|2.0|There are too many sexually &#34;intimate&#34; scenes without the ethical glue to hold the story together.  I would say it's a must miss.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I was so elated to see that I could finally get this on my Kindle! I can keep up with my favorite pastime. Got a Kindle, get Pinterest.
B00933U1EU|4.0|S Emotionally, it's suspenseful and all too realistic;  I wonder how many of the young men who fight overseas are vulnerable to the teachings of radical anything?  Remembering the recordings of Tokyo Rose of WWII attempting to brainwash/seduce the boys to betray their homeland. Terrorism is so scary to contemplate and this series explores my worst fears.

B0073XORCY|4.0|Saw Ian last night in Houston, TX.  Before that show, listened very little to TAAB2.  Anybody who is bashing Ian should check him out live with the current touring lineup.  Band is VERY tight and the album flows very well in concert.  Very enjoyable 2+ hours of music by extremely talented musicians.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|A nice movie about continuing to live your life with passion into your sunset years.  Good acting, good stories.  I would recommend this movie to all adults.

B009NPKTN6|1.0|Even though the movie had big name actors, it was horrendous.  The acting was terrible, the dialogue pitiful and the story-line just pathetic.  A pure waste of money.
B0086700CM|4.0|I enjoy this game late at night after a long day. As you get to different levels you experience different screens. The faster he runs the more you must pay close attention. I would like to see more involvement from the monkey. Maybe monkies coming out of trees or something.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love this game so much its better then temple run<br />the you collect coins and you can fly its just truly a great game and you should download to.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|If you expect to write a quick note on your Kindle Fire and view it later, you may be surprised when you can't view it unless you're online. I was. If you try to view your note while offline all you get is a screen suggesting an upgrade to the full version. Evernote allows you to synch your notes across many devices, which is good if that's what you're looking for. If you just want to keep some reminders on your Kindle then it's quite disappointing. Fortunately there are other apps that are very happy to record your notes and let you view them, all right there on the Kindle. No need to turn on wireless just to view a note.
B008K5T5AI|5.0|Excellent storytelling, very hard to put down. Can't wait to read more culture novels. I've read them all save for [[ASIN:0316030570 Use of Weapons (Culture)]] - really a shame this one is not available as kindle version.

They witness the violence, the missile attacks, the tragedies, the bloodbaths, the wars, the Soviet invasion, Taliban era, and post Taliban Taliban-era. The book talks about a time that has passed in Afghanistan that was unwanted and uninvited. The time, that would have never happened, anywhere in the world. Mariam is an illicit child. She lives in a poor state in a small house with her mother and works as a servant for rich families around. Her mother is neither willing nor has the money to send her to school. As per her mother only thing a women needs to learn is to accept anything that comes in her way in life (good or bad) without a bit of resistance and be patient always. Her unlawful father, a very rich man, used to come occasionally to meet them. When Mariam is in her mid-teens, her mother kills herself one day. Mariam tries to meet her father but is not allowed to enter his grand house. Her father is legally married to three women and is having nine children from them. Shortly after her mother's death, she is forcibly married to a shoemaker, Rasheed, by her father's family. The man she marries with, in his late forties, is a strict, horrifying man finding out the ways to torture Mariam. Laila, who lives in their neighborhood, and is daughter of liberal, educated parents loses her parents in a bomb attack but Rasheed saves Laila from the debris of her house. As per rule the savior is the owner, and thus Laila becomes the second wife of Rasheed. The two wives, far apart in their cultural values, one in total acceptance mode and another in rebellion mode, one totally orthodox and illiterate and another educated and liberal.

B009NQKXYK|4.0|The only complaint about this movie that I had was the engineers role. Too much mystery, no background (other than that they thought the engineers were the creators), and they didn't speak a word. It left more questions then any thing else. Maybe a second movie could justify this! Awesome flick otherwise
1878424114|4.0|[...]<br /><br />Book Review: Seven Spiritual Laws of Success by Deepak Chopra: Eastern Sprituality+Western Style = Deepak Chopra<br />A practical guide without any practicals!!!\\"A practical guide to the fulfillment of your dreams\\" - this is what the cover page says. But as far as my learning goes, the people who know how to convert their dreams are not meant for such books (actually it is vice versa!). The book has been written more with the purpose of marketing and selling than delivering best valued and long lasting stuff.<br /><br />Is it possible to get success just in Rs. 125/-!!!The book is a good read. Fill it shut it forget it. Don't worry if Rs. 150/- goes waste and dreams do not get converted to reality. Otherwise you may need another book to get rid of worries!!!<br /><br />Writer is smart enough to understand what will sell well!!!Deepak Chopra writes well. Concept or Style taken from literature liked by Western Community and Contents from our Vedas (and other ancient Hindu Holy Books). A mix juice produced has put its impact on many people. New York Times recommends it to people who have missed \\"The Prophet\\" by Kahlil Gibran. This would have been there in that news paper's jokes section. Some other similar books authors have an agreement to recommend each other's books and under this agreement there are recommendations on the back of cover page from Anthony Robbins author of \\"Awaken the Giant within and unlimited power\\", Ken Blanchard, co-author of \\"the one minute manager\\". This is a business or professional deal applicable in all countries.<br /><br />It is not that BAD either!!!It is a good read but for once only. Infact I was too impressed when I opened the bottle and smelled it. I got an impression that the Desi bottle is having imported Wine and buying has been a good bargain. The first peg was larger than Patiala one. It gave a high kick-start and made me ensure myself that I am going to achieve something big by the time I finish this book.<br /><br />Chapter one talks about SILENCE, MEDITATION and TALKING TO NATURE and BEING NON-JUDGEMENTAL - Be Silent for some time during the day (according to me when you think you are silent just check inside your body, brain and heart - there should be complete silence at that time, all silences fully synchronized), move towards meditation from silence. Frequently observe the power of nature by visiting a river, lake, sea, mountain or any other power (to me even a trees, birds, flowers are powerful signs of Nature). Most of the time, we are judgmental about people, incidents etc. which is wrong. Try being non-judgmental while listening, watching, reading, talking and learning (which is actually very difficult). I really loved Chapter one.<br />But subsequent chapters were more of a polished preaching rather than something coming out of heart or may be I was too involved in routine happenings and was not able to catch it or dwell into them appropriately.<br /><br />Chapter 2 talks about Law of Giving - you give wrong and get wrong in return. And you give right you get right in return. You get what to give. If you want money - give money (hahaha this is against all other teachings of life that state - always save money). you want good wishes then always wish good for all.<br /><br />Chapter 3 is Law of Karma. It talks about Cause and Effect. What we sow is what we reap. Boya ped babool ka to...<br /><br />Chapter 4 talks about Law of Least efforts. This also went against the regular teachings in life that say more efforts and hard work is required to earn more and get more in life. But Mr. Chopra says reverse. He says most of the things in Life and Nature happen themselves without any or least efforts. Like flowing of river, growing of tree, chirping of birds...<br /><br />Chapter 5 is Law of Intention and Desire - more spiritual rather than practical. It says if you intend sincerely and are positive with no harm to anyone attitude you have highest chances of getting yourdesires fulfilled. It guides to meditate and silently pray about your intentions...<br /><br />Chapter 6 - Law of Detachment - don't attach yourself to anything or anyone. Don't govern, let the things move or happen on their own.<br /><br />Chapter 7 - Law of Dharma or do and act. it talks about awakening your inner conscious or the Kundalini.<br /><br />Some best things about the Book and the Law Maker- Just 111 pages, seven chapters, seven Laws of life- A summary at the end of each Chapter- The Laws have been named very intelligently to increase the curiosity and provoking (especially western readers) for reading/buying this book.<br />- Deepak Chopra is an Executive Director of one of the Institutes in US (I am not sure US or UK) and his lectures are attended by most of the Western Countries.<br />[...]s...

B0047WJ12K|5.0|Christopher Jonathan James Nolan is one of the most intellectual, original, and influential directors of this century.<br />His 8 films are some of the greatest, most influential and iconic films of the decade.<br /><br />Inception is not as good as Memento, but at least as good as The Dark Knight. The stellar cast - Leonardo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine, boost the film to levels beyond comprehension.<br /><br />Inception is a film that must be watched twice to be comprehended, much less understood.<br />It's original plot and premise will take you by surprise, and really make you think.<br />It's equal parts sci-fi, action, thriller, and heist film.<br />Inception draws on films like The Matrix, and On Her Majesty's Secret Service, yet is totally original - straight for the mind of Christopher Nolan, where it germinated for 10 years.<br /><br />Is Inception overrated? Probably, in fact, YES, it's overrated. The hype has overrated, just as it has overrated The Dark Knight (another equally brilliant film).<br />It's great, but not perfect.<br /><br />However, Inception is  thought-provoking, well-acted, action packed, moving, exciting, MIND- BLOWING sci-fi action heist!<br />I highly recommend watching it for yourself!<br /><br />P.S. If this review was helpful to you, give it a like. Read my other reviews! Thanks!

B009E2WX3W|5.0|Peter Gabriel's [[ASIN:B000MK5QNO So]], released on the original Geffen Records label in 1986 as a 33 rpm vinyl album had a lot of meaning for this listener. It was the last vinyl LP that I ever bought, and my second CD as I was switching over to that 'new' medium at the time. I had that CD for many years until it disappeared in a move a few years ago, so it's been on a personal list to replace since then. And I'm glad that I waited, as the quality of this new remaster is superb, to put it mildly.<br /><br />If you're here to just grab this album in MP3 format, be aware that there are two separate versions, and I'll try to make this simple. Each of the tracks on both albums are 2012 remastered versions, so here is what you'll find.<br /><br />◆ [[ASIN:B009E2WX3W So (25th Anniversary Remaster)]]<br /><br />1. Red Rain; 5:39<br />2.

Biko (Live); 9:36<br /><br />The second album starts with the same tracks as the first, but offers Disc 2 and Disc 3 (obviously taken from the CD versions), and offers the live tracks that you see above, all of which came from Gabriel's double album \\"Live in Athens 1987\\" and as you can see, there's quite a bit more material in the second album. Both of these albums are also available in CD audio format.<br /><br />Peter Gabriel achieved his greatest popularity with songs from this album, and it became the best-selling album of the artist's career. Diehard fans already know that \\"So\\" charted at number 1 in the UK Album Chart, and at number 2 on the Billboard 200 in the US after its 1986 release.

B007IXWKUK|3.0|To Each His Own<br /><br /> As an author, I enjoy reading different types of books. I pride myself in being open minded and learning as much as I can from others. So although, The Fifty Shades Trilogy is a group of books I would have never picked up for personal enjoyment I had heard of the series and I wanted to know why the local libraries all had waiting list for the books. What could I learn from an author who had become an instant overnight success story? What was she doing that I was not?<br /> I read the first book and found the premise sufficient enough where I could continue or not with the reading. I went to the local library and upon seeing the waiting list for the second book I did not feel the urgent need to place the book on hold. However, after speaking with two coworkers I was led to believe that the second and third books were much better than the first and I should continue reading.  Consequently, I placed Fifty Shades Freed on hold but in the mean time found out that I could download the book on to my tablet so I did. I was reading the last chapters when the hold came in. The second and third books came for me at the same time. Not wanting to stop others from reading  I immediately turned in Fifty Shades Darker. The next day I finished reading the book. To my dismay the book ended abruptly.<br /> I thought maybe there was a glitch in the system and maybe the ending had not completely downloaded. I called the library and asked them to read to me the last sentence of the book. However, since none of the books were on the shelves she was unable to assist me. Her advice was to call a bookstore. I called one of the bookstores and when the customer service representative read the sentence I felt like I had been pushed off of the edge of a cliff. I felt cheated. It seemed to me that the author focused on foreshadowing into the next story rather than closing this story. Don't get me wrong the foreshadowing is great but the story also needed to be closed.To me it seemed like the author was more interested in getting readers to read the next book than she was interested in completing the story which to me as a reader was very upsetting.<br /> The transition between the first and second books Fifty Shades and Fifty Shades Darker was wonderful. I knew exactly what was going on. But, I found the transition between Fifty Shades Darker  and Fifty Shades Freed to be lacking. In my humble opinion there was no transition. I have no idea what transpired between the birthday party and the vacation. I am now on page 20 of Fifty Shades Freed  and I'm confused. Without giving away the story line I'm not sure of their current relationship standing as a couple. Another gripe is a lot of the words in Fifty Shades Darker  are repetitive. While reading I thought if Christian had one more avuncular or lascivious smile I am going to scream.<br /> To sum it up, obviously this author is doing something right. I mean after all her books are not making it to the shelves in the local libraries. I will read the final book Fifty Shades Freed but my hope is that in the end there will be closure. For me all books should have closure even when part of a series. So as I continue to write my series I will make sure that each book can stand alone but does transition to the next. Although foreshadowing is what keeps me on the edge of my seat anticipating what will happen next I find nothing to be more of a waste of time as a reader than lack of closure.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|Watching [[ASIN:B0067EKY7M Salmon Fishing in the Yemen]] for the fist time, one might think of it as touching, funny, slightly inane, and somewhat unexpected. I should add delightful as well. There are some thoughtful and undeveloped undercurrents of some serious topics here, but this is a movie to just sit back and enjoy.<br /><br />The film was adapted for film by Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m, from British writer and author Paul Torday's 2006 debut novel [[ASIN:B003K16P50 Salmon Fishing in the Yemen]], which won the 2007 Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize for comic writing.<br /><br />We have a plan dreamed up by a visionary sheik played by Amr Waked, and the sheik has the financial resources to turn a Middle Eastern desert into a recreational utopia for sport fishermen. Our sheik seems to be a New Age mystic of sorts, who is given to letting loose with a bit of inspirational gibberish at times... and for this viewer, this just adds to the story. Add in Kristin Scott Thomas's depiction of Patricia Maxwell, the British prime minister's press secretary, and she snaps her dialogue with a real tone of severe icy disdain.<br /><br />The sheik is an avid fly fisherman who has an estate in Scotland, and he visualizes a prodigious water management project that involves the construction of a salmon run in which the salmon can swim upstream to spawn. He declares that this will bring his preferred leisure activity closer to home and will also help his people. The sheik's plan is proposed to the British government by his assistant, Harriet (Emily Blunt), and Patricia Maxwell sees this as a perfect opportunity to distract the public from the conflicts in the Middle Eastern conflicts, resulting in political points for her boss.<br /><br />Dr. Alfred `Fred' Jones (played by Ewan McGregor) is a British fisheries expert is approached to assess the feasibility of the idea, which would involve importing thousands of North Atlantic salmon from Britain to Yemen. He believes this plan to be ridiculous and impossible to carry out, and he dismisses the idea. But Patricia has done her research and has found that two million British voters are fishing enthusiasts, so she pressures Fred's boss to force his participation in this scheme.<br /><br />However there's an uproar that follows when British fishermen learn that their salmon stock will be depleted. The only solution to this dilemma is to use farmed salmon, which have absolutely no river experience. Then comes the big question as to whether farmed salmon will follow their wild brethren's instincts and head upstream.<br /><br />Fred is an unhappily married bureaucrat whose cold wife of two decades leaves him for months at a time to conduct her business in other places. He develops an undeclared romantic attraction to Harriet, but her boyfriend Robert (Tom Mison) is fighting overseas. She receives news that Robert is missing in action, and she falls apart.<br /><br />There's a perfunctory subplot where the sheik becomes the target of an assassination plot by Islamic extremists, but the biggest moment of suspense has nothing to do with terrorism: it comes when the farmed salmon are released into the waters of their new home. Will the farmed salmon follow their wild comrades' instincts and head upstream, or will they just swim around in complete confusion? And will Fred and Harriet and Fred get together? You'll have to see the film for those answers.<br /><br />If anyone wonders about the impact of this movie, a May 2012 article in The Telegraph (UK) noted that the Yemen Tourism Promotion Board had been \\"inundated\\" with requests about the country following the film's release, and that salmon fishing isn't actually that popular in the Western Asian country, though there are sea fishing opportunities there.<br /><br /> [[ASIN:B0067EKY7M Salmon Fishing in the Yemen]] can be quirky in places, but if you liked [[ASIN:B005S9EJ14 The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel]] or [[ASIN:B00005JMFQ Love Actually]], then you'll probably enjoy this film. For this viewer, it was better to just sit back and enjoy it, and as a result, I'm hooked.<br /><br />10/28/2012y enjoy this film. For this viewer, it was better to just sit back and enjoy it, and as a result, I'm hooked.<br /><br />10/28/2012

B008XG1X18|5.0|Love pinterest, glad their is finally an app. Works well and it appears the first kinks they had have been ironed out.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I've read some of the bad reviews, and they seem focused on a few things: 1) Scary scenes, 2) Nudity, 3) Lack of romance. Well, my three year old is super brave so I do agree that a lot of sensitive littles may have an issue with the movie, but it's not really an issue in our household. Nudity? Well, that's kind of laughable as it's an animated movie. I guess some people would rather hear fart humor and characters calling each other jackass (\\"Shrek\\"), and if that's you then skip this one, but it's really just two quick scenes and not in a scandalous way. And about that lack of romance... one of the reasons I love this movie for my daughter is the lack of romance for the main character. In fact, the whole plot is about teenager Merida trying to change her \\"fate\\" which is to get married before she's ready. She passionately pleads during one speech to the parents of her suitors to let their children decide when they are ready for marriage and to choose their own spouses. This is beyond refreshing after decades of Disney princess schlock where the all too young princess gets into a scrape and must be rescued by a man and then lives \\"happily ever after\\". Also, I found the romantic sparks between Merida's parents to be pretty sweet.<br /><br />If you're raising an independent daughter you want to think for herself and not think girls are meant to be saved by boyfriends, don't skip this movie. (If she's sensitive and scares easily, wait until she's at least school age, though.)
B0042RUMJG|3.0|Re Sting Berlin Concert. I was rather disappointed with the audio quality of this<br />recording and to some extent the video as well. Sting's microphone system was distorted<br /> and sibilant,the mixing was such that individual instruments were not audible at times<br />and overall the audio was muddy. The performance was professional as you would expect<br /> from Sting, and the orchestra got quite involved which was quite entertaining. It is<br />unfortunate that the Bluray's inherent quality was not exploited properly. I enjoyed in<br />particular 'Russians' and 'Desert Rose'. In fact I have purchased Prokfiev's 'Romeo and Juliet\\"<br />ballet on the strength of the arrangement of 'Russians'.<br />Again, Amazon's service was up to the usual excellence.<br />Regards,<br />Builderbob.

Well, I'd Recomend &quot;Bad Piggies&quot; For Your Kindle, iPod, Whatever. I Would Also Recomend &quot;Angry Birds Seasons&quot;. Hope u Hate This App. I got this App for free because it was The free app of the day in September.
B0079HLDCQ|5.0|I was thinking of the saying \\"the thinking woman's assassin (crumpet)\\" but it really isn't that appropriate since we are talking about an assassin after all.  I had THE most sympathy for lead character, Will Robie.  He really does have morals and sounds like a good person.  The other characters are more realistic than those in most novels.  The writing is fluid and the proof reader was pretty good too.<br /><br />You can almost feel his pain whilst dealing with a near genius 14 year old girl - she absolutely needs his help, but is not sure she can trust him, and he is strugglying with becoming involved with a person so closely.<br /><br />This is a very good book in my opinion - I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.

B007N5YIUS|2.0|Though this game is fun, I do not like it as much as regular Angry Birds or Angry Birds seasons. I do not mind the ads in the other Angry Birds games because they are small and at the top of the screen, the ads in Space take the whole page and you have to close out the whole screen between levels. It just gets annoying because it seems like it happens every level wether you complete it or not.

B002HWRYJE|4.0|Bottom Line First:<br />This movie is worth a viewing or two. I liked it. Be sure to let it go as soon as you remove the disk.<br /><br />It seems that when you review items that have a cult following you are supposed to qualify yourself.<br />Yes I have been a follower of Star Trek since the beginning. I have seen all of the movies. I have watched all of the various spin off TV programs although not all episodes.<br />I have attended all of one Comic Con, and part of a second, never in costume or to argue over Star Trek Vs Star Wars vs Star (Fill in the blank).  During what I remember as ComicCon 1 (2?), I stayed up till 2 AM acting as a volunteer projectionist while we waited for our copy of the first bloopers real to be allowed into our presence. So fan yes, Klingon speaking episode quoting hard core capital `F' Fan, no<br /><br />This item in the Star Trek universe will be considered, very briefly in one of three lights: As a stand alone entertainment, as science fiction and as a franchise re-boot.<br /><br />This movie is entertaining. If you like action adventure movies this is more than worth its present low price (under $6 as I write). I do not see it as something most folks in the non-fan category will want to view many times. This may be a candidate for instant view or rental. There are things you may not see without many viewings, some of those things you may not want to see.<br /><br />Plot. Does it matter?<br />We got this somewhat sympathetic villain named Nemo, who shows up with this super powerful ship that has never before seen ability to tear apart ships. Nemo seems to have a major resentment of... So far this is Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, except this time we have time travel, a snow planet, some sparkly and flashing lights and more or less special effects. And yes this movie has the expendable red shirt.<br /><br />The Science Fiction.<br />Here the less said the better. In short, enjoy the movie with your brain in neutral. As soon as you start thinking about the logic and the details, this movie becomes frustrating. The original TV shows were scientifically inconsistent and even silly. It is not asking too much that this movie suffers some of the same. It may be that movie companies deliberately allow some of these things just to feed the `experts' - like me- who generate interest by going on about them.<br /><br />Rebooting the Franchise<br />This movie is not so much about the plot as it is an introduction to a new cast. I like this new cast. Chris Pine as the new Kirk has learned some of Shatner's physical mannerisms even if he has skipped the famous Shatner pauses. Pine has the quick thinking, hell for leather approach needed for this role. He does seem to take a lot of punches to the face.<br /><br />Zachary Quinto will do nicely as Spock. He is physically believable, arches his eyebrow with the best of them and has left some room to make this his own role.<br /><br />Karl Urban (Bones) and Simon Pegg (Scotty) had some great lines and some of the best comic delivery.  Zoe Saldana as Uhura is more than just a pretty face while John Cho (Mr. Sulu ) and Anton Yelchin (Mr. Chekov) are baby faced and earnest.<br /><br />In sum this is a young crew and they should be able to make this new cast work for as long as the money flows in.<br /><br />Early in the movie the statement is made that Star Fleet is a \\"peace keeping organization\\". I object. The Mission is \\"To explore.. to seek out new\\". Gene Roddenberry had a vision that drove the Star Trek universe. It was not just about six guns at high noon. He certainly depended on the save the universe plots, but underneath he would never have killed off entire home worlds just to make a pretty special effect. Star Trek survives because it had a belief not just explosions<br /><br />The next movie in the reboot is due out in May 2013.

1442346949|4.0|The book described well what made Steve the man that he was. Although his innovations and intuitions were leaps and bounds ahead of everyone else, he had some psychological issues from both his childhood (abandoned) and his college years (LSD). He was difficult to work for and belittled many people that he thought were \\"idiots\\".<br /><br />I admire the Apple  products and also give credit for the more recent ones to his design team led by Jonny Ives.<br /><br />The way he led Pixar to become THE leader in annomation was incredible. It was equally impressive how he negotiated the sale of Pixar to Disney, but keeping the companies separate.<br /><br />In the end, it was sad that his need for control didnt allow the doctors to attack the cancer early or the story of SJ might have continued.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I'm a big predator and alien fan and enjoy every movie that comes out. I am looking forward the next movies!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|The play-ability of this game is amazing!  Meaning, you can play it over and over and NEVER have the same game twice.  It's great as 3 or 4 players also.  The instructions may seem like a lot of information at first, but they are well written and informative and after one game you'll never be the same :)  We're hopelessly addicted now, and looking forward to checking out expansion packs!<br />One sidenote though; while the game is awesome, do be sure to take good care of it.  We have found that some carelessness causes the edges of cardboard pieces to get wrecked, so be gentle with it so your game lasts as long as your addiction!<br />This is probably the best board game I have ever played.  Monopoly meets Risk, but with shorter games (once you know how to play).

B001KVZ6HK|4.0|The movie and discs themselves are great, the picture and sound quality are awesome and there's loads of special features. The bluray itself I have no problems with.<br /><br />Unfortunately because of the packaging amazon use, the lenticular card sleeve on the box ended up getting crushed. It's not a huge thing, the discs were all ok and not scratched, but when you buy something new you expect everything to be in perfect condition which wasn't the case here. If this sort of thing would be a problem it might be best to buy it in a store.
B004K8WPUQ|1.0|Like most of you I spent alot of time looking at reviews and checking out samples of the different video Mic solutions. I had ultimately decided on the Rode videomic Pro.<br /><br />I can tell you that this is by far the worse product I have ever bought. The plastic is so cheap on it. If you don't plan on ever moving your camera then this crappy Mic is for you. For the money you spend, it is not worth it at all. I bought this mic for my brothers wedding, and when we were driving to the church after I shot some footage at home the mic broke off the the hot shoe. Like literaly fell apart while it was in my hand in the car.<br /><br />if you look at the mic right under it is attached to the other plastic part by pieces of rubber and by rubber I mean they look like pieces of rubber band attached to it. We were driving on the highway and the mic was shaking like crazy. It is very unstable in it's mount.<br /><br />So I ended up returning this mic because it's construction is garbage. If you like to waste money you should buy this mic.<br /><br />I wanted to give this mic Zero stars but apparently that's not an option.<br /><br />They offer 10 year warranty because they know the mic will break.

B005LAIGPU|2.0|I can't bring myself to give this hollywood garbage a '1 star'.....those are reserved for the truly, worst-of-the-worst; however, this is really, really bad.  I'm glad I only paid $1 from a red box rental.  I watched it with my 12 year old son and we both thought it really stunk....
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I'm kind of surprised at the number of '1 and 2 star reviews' on this one.  I just watched it with my 12 year old son and we both thought it was a decent movie.  They obviously had a large budget, because the special effects and cinematography were outstanding.  Funny thing is though, I mostly rented the movie because I'm a fan of Charlize Theron's work.  However, I thought she was the one weak point in the movie.  She probably should have changed her interpretation of her character; it seemed a little forced and almost fake.  Interesting Biblical references throughout the movie...resurrection, forbidden fruit...that sort of thing.  Anyways, it's worth renting just for the visual effects alone...  story is good, not great....some acting flaws kind of bring it down a bit.  It's about a 3 1/2 star movie in my book.
B00498XRPE|5.0|Alien and Aliens are two of the best sci fi movies ever made.  Quality of the video was very good and no interruptions in play.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I can't stop gushing to anyone who will listen! I fell in LOVE with the cast. Sophia is quirky and such a GREAT wiccan character. I was relieved the author didn't paint wicca as a dark art and chose an honest depiction instead. I laughed so many times. I also loved the irony that as much as she hated the wiccan stereotypes she had to embrace them at the end of the story in her attempt to go unnoticed by the maltorim. Charles and Sophia had a steamy relationship, obviously tense because Sophia is so young and inexperienced and because of the issue of immortality. Trust me this book really approached the immortal/mortal relationship in a new way. None of the characters are perfect but I like my characters to have some flaws. Also thank GOD not everyone was in love with Sophia. I hate reading a book where everyone loves a character for no reason. I really really wished that there had been more Adrian though and would not have minded a love triangle if he would have been the other guy involved because he was SO HOT. I just wanted more and more of him! I'd also like to see more Lauren because she was so unique and fun! Hum, maybe Lauren and Adrian can get together in a future book? I am a huge fan for life now!
B001PPLIEQ|5.0|I'll be the first to admit I was not enthused about the idea of this rather brutish, unknown blonde taking over the much vaunted mantle of James Bond. I have always been a Connery/Moore/Lazenby fan, with honorable mention to Brosnan, but the last Bond movie to be really exciting to me was the The World Is Not Enough (best of a somewhat mixed run by Brosnan).  I had intended to check out Casino Royale after the smashing reviews, but ended up watching Quantum first.  No matter, as this film is likewise a clean slate compared to any Bond before. Quantum is a stark departure from the rather happy go lucky playboy Bond of the early years, it is a far more realistic view of what this world would actually be like. And unlike any previous Bond, Craig is RIPPED and actually looks like he could take down a gang of thugs with his fists!<br /><br />An effort was obviously made to shift radically away from the tux and martini days, and it was a direct hit as far as I'm concerned.  Craig has breathed new life into the series (it needed it).  In some ways I miss the old Bond, but then again, it would be utterly silly to rehash the same old formula, wouldn't it?  Bond has always been the cutting edge of action-adventure spy movies, so it's fitting for the brand to evolve with the times.  Having said that, several clever ques to the past were also included, such as proving Bond's Law still holds----if you are an attractive female and become involved with Bond (as they always do), your life just became much shorter!  Instead of gold body paint, there was a twist this time, but a nod to the past, indeed.  However, Bond defies his own boss in a way that he never has before, a bold move that worked. I do hope that Craig will be given the chance to evolve into the smoother Bond at some point in his run to more fully realize his potential, although he is perfectly suited to being a wrecking machine! My only complaint for this movie was the rather bland arch villain, although again, I suppose he is closer to more typical international criminal and less cartoon character.  Pity though, how would Austin Powers come up with a way to spoof these bland villains??<br /><br />As you'd expect, the audio-video is stunning and there are no shortages of high speed chases and LOUD gunfire to demonstrate your home theater system to the fullest. I have slight disappointment in the fact that CGI was used in the plane chase sequence, even to show smoke pouring out due to damage, knowing this would have been done in reality with a smoke machine in the past, but I guess that's unavoidable today.  At least it is very well done.  Like the writing, the production as a whole is an A-List enterprise.<br /><br />Very much looking forward to seeing Mr. Craig's Bond again in Skyfall!closer to more typical international criminal and less cartoon character.  Pity though, how would Austin Powers come up with a way to spoof these bland villains??  As you'd expect, the audio-video is stunning and there are no shortages of high speed chases and LOUD gunfire to demonstrate your home theater system to the fullest.

B009RI4FRU|3.0|I really don't think this film would have gotten nearly the attention it did had it not been labeled \\"artful\\".<br />Once labeled as such, who would find it boring except the unsophisticated?<br />Call me unsophisticated.
B000ID37T0|5.0|Great movie, I love Pacino in this film. No many how many times I see it I always get a lump in my throat at the end...
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is very similar to 50 shades of gray.  I can't put the book down!<br />I can't wait to start reading the 2nd book in this serious.

1451620829|1.0|Wow, is this guy hard to like!  I could not believe the amount of negative energy he put into this.  He's a complainer and a quitter by his own admission, but that's really just the tip of the iceberg.  He's a drug-abusing, tantrum-throwing baby who couldn't manage his money or his life, yet he thinks he's the victim of malicious schemes of the evil Gene and Paul.<br /><br />Thinking about what Peter brought to the band, I could only come up with a few positives.  The Catman makeup is probably his best contribution, followed by the song \\"Beth\\" (though the lyrics were probably written mostly by his friend, and the music refined and mostly rewritten by Bob Ezrin who also changed the title from stupid \\"Beck\\").  Other than that, what?  A lot of complaining.  By the way, Peters chops on the drums were terrible.  Those herky-jerky mangled fills between basic drumming that any kid could do in his garage.  Just listen.  There are only a couple of instances where I think Peter's drumming stlye actually helped a song:  \\"100,000 Years\\", \\"Watchin' You\\", maybe a couple more.  Otherwise, the band would've been so much better with another drummer.<br /><br />Speaking of other drummers, everybody KISS had after Peter could play, and the music was technically improved.  Peter complains in the book that Paul criticized his timing, and dared to do it in front of his daughter.  Well, don't bring her to rehearsals then.  That's where you work out the bugs, isn't it?  And his timing has always been terrible, in case he thinks those comments were unjustified.  I'm sure it was a big change for the band going back to Peter after having a taste of Anton Fig, Eric Carr, and Eric Singer.<br /><br />I don't think I've ever seen a guy ride other people's coat-tails, get handed so much in life, and yet be so upset about it.  He's one of the original four faces, so there's a lot of nostalgia when it comes to what he means to KISS.  But after reading his book, I'm over the guy, and it makes all thesense in the world why it was impossible for Gene and Paul to go any further with him.  Don't blame them, Peter, blame yourself.  I can't believe I just wrote this about someone I thought of as an icon.
B002KVSJ64|5.0|This album is a great follow-up to \\"Phobia\\"! I personally like this album as an album due to its cohesive focus and mood. It sounds great all the way through and is a pretty consistent listen. \\"Phobia\\" to my ears was a little unfocused as the beginning was filled to the brim with great moments and then it went downhill after track 7. Apparently this is their first album that was written by Ben when he was sober (might have something to do with the cohesiveness) and it really does sound great!<br /><br />The music:<br /><br />1. \\"Fade Away\\"- Starts off with a rather dark sounding guitar riff. This song then erupts in to an epic melodic hard rocking verse! One thing I've always loved about Breaking Benjamin is how easily they could blend heavy riffs and melodic guitar parts together and then put vocals on top! And the drums are great as well. This song just starts this album out great! It's got some dark lyrics and a dark sound to go with it and I personally think it's one of their best songs ever.<br /><br />2. \\"I Will Not Bow\\"- This song was co-written by Jasen Rauch formerly of RED. And it continues the dark, heavy, melodic metal we know and love from this band. It has a great vocal part from Burnley and this one is one that you can sing along to everytime you hear it! I just love this one. It's a good single as well. This song has darker sounds but the lyrics are actually on the positive side of things. It's a pretty good contrast. I don't think many other bands could pull of a contrast like this that actually works. Great song!<br /><br />3. \\"Crawl\\"- This one is another heavier one! I love the opening to this song! The verse on this one is actually the most melodic of the 1st 3 songs. It's really good! The song then picks up in the pre-chorus with some heavier guitar layers and some gritty vocals. The chorus also has a fast, frantic guitar part going on underneath Ben's long, majestic vocals. This is just an overall good song! I personally rank this one along side \\"I Will Not Bow\\" in terms of being able to both rock out and sing along everytime it is heard!<br /><br />4. \\"Give Me a Sign\\"- This is a beautiful song! This entire album has a dark sound to it. But when ballads have a darker tone to them, it makes a much better ballad than a happier ballad in my opinion. The music in this one is a contrast of uplifting melodies and dark chords. It works very well to my ears. It is really a ballad that you could play at a dance for people to slow dance to. This one has more meaning and use at a dance than pretty much all the modern country ballads that people play at dances. The biggest thing though is this is great to listen to by itself too!<br /><br />5. \\"Hopeless\\"- There's nothing wrong with this song a all. I'm just not as fond of it as the other songs on this album. There's always going to be at least one or two songs on an album that I won't like and this is one of two for this album. Again, it sounds good, but I just don't like it as much as the others.<br /><br />6. \\"What Lies Beneath\\"- This is another dark sounding ballad. This one has a triplet feel and I'm very fond of triplet type songs. It has a great chorus and a great dark sounding interlude and just all around great sounds! This one isn't a good one to play at dances though because it has some tempo and time changes. It's great to listen to though and the vocals are beautiful with the guitar parts in this one! Ben is definitely one of the best Modern Metal singers! I really like the lyrics that his album has. They really possess a quality that Breaking Benjamin hasn't had before in my opinion.<br /><br />7. \\"Anthem of the Angels\\"- Another slower song and again, we have a darker sound with deep lyrics. They really hit a home run with the lyrics on these songs! They are more than focused and because the whole album has a darker tone and deeper lyrics, it really flows nicely! I don't think I've heard another album that is as focused as this one. I like songs like this because they have great lyrics and great music.<br /><br />8. \\"Lights Out\\"- This is the other song that I don't like on the album. Just like the other one, nothing sounds bad, but I just don't like it as much as the rest. It's not bad at all, the others are just better!<br /><br />9. \\"Dear Agony\\"- This song and the following two are my favorites of the entire album! And this album is pretty much all good songs! This song I could easily picture as being a slow song at a dance and it is a great song! The lyrics of this one connect with me a little bit. The music is dark, kind of haunting, and beautiful! This one is probably one of the best songs they've ever done! This is better than all but 3 songs on \\"Phobia\\" and that is saying something since that album is considered their best by everyone (except me). This is probably the best Title track I've heard in the past few months! Excellent song!<br /><br />10. \\"Into the Nothing\\"- This is the best heavy song here! It has that dark tone to it, but it has lots of melodic passages from different instruments throughout the song! I really like the lyrics and how they are sung \\"Stay with me, you're all I have left\\" i really like this song as well. It is another favorite of mine! I really find this song to be of the same quality as \\"Diary of Jane\\". I know that's pretty radical, but I really think so!<br /><br />11. \\"Without You\\"- This is a perfect closer to an amazing and beautiful album! The drums here are great and the melody is one of their best! Lyrics are again very inspired and very cohesive! The chorus is GREAT! I LOVE IT! And the best part is all the different little bridges it has and the closing orchestra part! This is definetely one of my favorites! Best closer to a Breaking Benjamin Album that I've heard so far!<br /><br />Overall, this is a GREAT album, I'd actually recommend this one over \\"Phobia\\" because it is much better than it regardless of what others say. The great songs on \\"Phobia\\" are some of Breaking Benjamin's best, but this entire album is full of songs that have a consistent quality and feeling and it is more emotional than \\"Phobia\\" ever was for me. Great Album guys! Hope there's another great one coming!

B0076DCT2G|3.0|I must preface my remarks by saying that I am a huge Nelson DeMille fan. One of the things I really loved about this book is that it paired two of his most popular characters, John Corey and Paul Brenner. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to make this book as good as DeMille's others.<br /><br />This is one of the most tedious books I have ever read. For my taste, about two thirds of the book was unnecessary. The worst was when The Panther was interrogating his henchman, Nabeel, who then rehashed an entire section of the book in only slightly less detail than that section itself.<br /><br />I think DeMille is a brilliant writer and story teller. I can't even begin to guess why this book veered off into such dullness.<br /><br />For me, all the main characters were lifeless and one-dimensional. John Corey and his wife Kate Mayfield just didn't have the snap and pizazz as the previous books. Kate, especially, was almost lifeless. I don't think she had more than two consecutive sentences of dialogue at any point in the book.<br /><br />The part that I found especially bewildering was the introduction of another character from The General's Daughter, Col. William Kent. Wasn't he the murderer in that book???<br /><br />All told, The Panther was disappointing. Even the ending wasn't really a resolution. I won't give up on DeMille, but sad to say this book wasn't worth the time I spent reading it.

0451457994|5.0|Originally posted at FanLit.<br /><br />\\"The thing's hollow -- it goes on forever -- and -- oh my God -- it's full of stars!\\"<br /><br />2001: A Space Odyssey is the novel that Arthur C. Clarke wrote so that Stanley Kubrick could develop it into the now-famous movie. It's partly based on two of Clarke's short stories: \\"Encounter in the Dawn\\" (1953) and \\"The Sentinel\\" (1948). The first story tells of a technologically advanced race that visited Earth millions of years ago, discovered early humans, and gave them some technological jumpstarts (and \\"one small step toward humanity.\\") In the second story, humans have finally reached the moon. Much to their excitement and consternation, they discover an ancient alien artifact that may be an alarm to alert aliens when humans manage to get themselves off their little planet.<br /><br />If you've seen the movie, you know that we see these plotlines unfold and connect in 2001: A Space Odyssey. A related plot involves a spaceship traveling to Saturn that's controlled by a new self-conscious computer named HAL 9000. Perhaps the most famous scenes in the movie (and I think these are some of the best scenes in the book, too) occur when HAL decides to override the astronauts' commands because of his own interpretation of his original instructions (this reason is not explained in the movie). These scenes are probably even more frightening today than they were back in 1968. Clarke perfectly captures our fear that the artificial intelligences we create may become smarter than we are and, therefore, out of our control.<br /><br />I can't resist Arthur C. Clarke's visions and I have enjoyed everything I've read by him. It's exciting and awe-inspiring to read his speculations about creation, the mysteries of space and time, extraterrestrials, artificial intelligence, the freeing of the spirit from the body, the existence and nature of God, and what's \\"behind the back of space.\\" I also enjoy his theoretical arguments about the speed of light, physics, relativity, wormholes, etc. Clarke's awe of space and his expectation that humans will conquer it is infectious and thrilling. At the same time, the possibility that we, who thought we were alone, may not be, is both exciting and disturbing. Clarke writes beautifully of both the potential glories and horrors of space.<br /><br />I listened to Dick Hill narrate Brilliance Audio's version of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Dick Hill narrates a lot of old science fiction and here he is as wonderful as he always is. His voice for HAL was so creepy it gave me chills (\\"Hey, Dave... what are you doing?\\"). The audiobook begins with an interesting talk by Arthur C. Clarke in which he gives us some context and background for the story, talks a bit about his writing process and collaboration with Stanley Kubrick, and mentions some of the pop culture that the book and movie have spawned. Three sequels to 2001: A Space Odyssey continue the story and address some of the questions that Clarke leaves us with.ght, physics, relativity, wormholes, etc. Clarke's awe of space and his expectation that humans will conquer it is infectious and thrilling.

B007Q1VUFA|5.0|As a long time Black Crowes fan, this is a fantastic offering from Chris Robinson.  A musical journey which resembles some Black Crowes, and from another side Grateful Dead.  Excellent production.  Favorite tracks are Rosalee and Reflections.  If you like the Crowes...do not hesitate to buy this CD!
B000W93CHC|5.0|I loved this book, I couldn't put it down. I almost read it in one sitting but it was too long to do so.<br />I really didn't want this book to end. One of the best books I've ever read.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Fun and challenging, but lots of help available when I needed it. The &quot;active places&quot; part of the map.made it easy when I got stuck.
B00007L4MJ|1.0|This disc was the worst, could not even get through the whole movie! It stopped working about 1 hour and 20 minuets into the awesome movie that Metropolis is. Terrible disc/dvd, great movie!
B009HV2JT8|1.0|I've read this book several times and was very excited to say the least when I learned that they made a movie. Tim Burton completely ruined it. It was so far off the book that they shouldn't have used the title. Horrible horrible horrible. I was so pissed off that if I ever run into Tim Burton in going to give him a piece of my mind. If you liked the book as I did, you'll hate the movie. What a shame... I want my $ back
B0031RS2HC|5.0|Brilliant!  I loved this book and am now starting to read the entire series.  What a great writer and this is my second Lee Child book but I am now a total fan.  I will be reading the rest of the Jack Reacher books in sequence and can't recommend him highly enough.  Well written with a good plot, if you like thrillers, this is for you.
B00984668E|4.0|I don't usually write reviews of bands but thought I had to this time.  This disk is very good and consistent.  The riffs and hooks are very catchy.  The only real knock I have on this band is that they sound almost exactly like Corrosion of Conformity.  CoC started in the 80s but their most popular work is from the mid 90s.  If you like this I would highly recommend checking out CoC's Deliverance or Wiseblood.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I couldn't put it down in the beginning but it kind of fizzled out, as though the author didn't quite know where to go with it.
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|We could not stand to finish watching this movie. It is so sick and disturbing - kids killing each other while society cheers.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|if you need something simple the this is ur app!!! love it!!!;) but mostly its for simple math by using add subtract divide or multiply

B008JFUUIA|5.0|If your a fan of Glee than you'll love this movie, because it's even better. This movie is about a girl named Beca(Anna Kendrick)she's kind of a loner and uses music to escape and loves making her own. Her dream is to go to LA to pursue her love of music, but instead she makes a deal with her father who she does not get along with very well to go to college for a year and to get into the college life. Chloe(Brittany Snow) who is a senior of the Bella's wants Beca to join so, Beca's forced to join the Bella's a cappella group, but its not all bad when Beca meets Jesse(Skylar Astin) a guy she's into who just so happens to be her competiton. You must see this movie its Aca-good.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is a great story told in the first person from two central characters - Belle, a kitchen slave and Lavinia, an indentured servant. The two characters come alive through the excellent dialogue that the author imparts to them. The author, Kathleen Grissom has written a truly sensitive narative about plantation life in late 17th and early 18th century Virginia. Most stories bore the hell out of me - not this one! This is a true winner!
B005LQ6UE8|5.0|This is a real adventure story and I could not put it down.  Even if it is not true, as some claim, it is still a fascinating and interesting story.
B0096HIEE2|2.0|I love Channing Tatum! I loved Dear John! That was a very good movie.  Watched it several times. I liked The Vow. But Magic Mike was a huge disappointment.
B008578PRK|4.0|The Woman in Black is a good old fashioned ghost story.  The story is solid and the atmosphere is ethereal.  Spooky but not gory.  Some unsettling scenes involving suicidal children but tame enough for teenagers.  I enjoyed it.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I knew after seeing this movie at the theatre, I would not only want to own it, but to have the Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo pack. I bought one for myself, and another as a gift. This movie has all the great super-hero characters in one epic story and it delivers! If you know Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer series, Firefly/Serenity), then you know his GENIUS comedic writing and directing. This movie had ALL the visual/CG elements you'd want to see, plus strong characters and plot, and clever, hilarious writing. *LOVE IT!!*

B003B02O7I|5.0|Most people will probably review this book and think it is boring or lacking in the usual Grisham excitement.  I for one think it is right in line with Grisham's best works.  While reading you can actually see the film (if there were one to be made) playing out on the pages in front of you.  One of, if not my favorite, Grisham novel; and I've read nearly all of them.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|A bit hard to get into but absolutely wonderful!!  I loved the characters and the story was new to me.  I am soooo glad I read it!
B00136JQMI|5.0|This is such a good selection for those who appreciate good jazz from one of the greatest on this platform. I'm sure that others might have a difference of opinion as to what really goes well with this album, but for me...it's a glass of nice red.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite books because it helps me understand how to grow relationships. It applies to spouses, children, employers, employees - anyone you have a relationship with. I have found when people feel loved/appreciated they give their best effort, are willing to work out compromises, and have a sense of belonging. I would recommend this book to everyone, but especially people who supervise other people.
B000C20VPA|5.0|This is definately one of the best movies I have ever scene. It's an epic tale both about the rise and fall of mob control in Las Vegas and also a fascinating tale of some very interesting characters. It's a long movie but worth every minute. Definately not for the faint of heart either.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was just as good as the Shades of Grey series.  Can't wait for the next installment to see what happens with Gideon and Eva!
B009NPKTN6|3.0|Rock of ages was a cute little musical. Tom Cruise was a total rocker and it was hilarious to see him play such a fun roll. Alec Baldwin also played a great part. The movie had great casting.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|OK.  I already knew I loved the movie.  So, I was just happy to be able to watch it any time I wanted...but hey!  What a great combo pack!  All in one.  Gotta' Love IT!  But, the best surprise was the connection to the iTunes App.  I had my doubts that it would work, but they were totally unfounded.  I held my iPod Touch to my TV once the movie started, (and having started the app), and it synced to the movie!  I ended up watching the app instead of the movie.  Neat trivia and artwork.  I loved it.  It was as if I stepped through a time machine and was using technology not invented yet.  This was sooo cool.  If you have the combo pack and haven't tried this out yet - DO IT NOW!  Seriously, it was a blast.  It made it fun to watch the whole movie one more time.  I'm a slow reader, so the movie invariably got ahead of me...so I just used the resync \\"button\\" on the app and yup, I was back in sync.  Really fun app.  And I'm still fascinated with its ability to sync via audio from my non-fancy, non-special TV and Blu-Ray player.<br /><br />I guess I should also mention that you can take the \\"cover\\" to the case off (it's a \\"card\\") and sit in your house - my kids love it.  It's a 3-D picture.<br /><br />Like I said, you've Gotta' Love IT!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|From the start to the end, the climax never ended. The thoughtfulness of the author can be seen in the storyline carefully planned yet wildly unexpected. A book that definitely worth reading.
1423140605|3.0|The format is getting a bit stale and very predictable. Some of the pop culture references are cringe inducing. Tons of action, yet very little of it had me on the edge of my seat. The character development of Leo is in my opinion the highlight of the book, perhaps because there is so little character development to be found.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved all 3 can't wait for the movie when I first started the book I was not sure but they we very addicting sad I'm done not sure what to read now
B001FOPODS|5.0|I have been showing this movie to my students for the past three years and they LOVE it!  I want to mention, though, that I only use this in grades 3 and above.  For K-2 I use the older Disney version.<br /><br />This story is a bit dark, but I think tells the tale well.  The music doesn't start until several minutes into the movie.  In the scenes with the duck and cat my kids are laughing their heads off.<br /><br />If you are expecting the movie to be an end-all teaching tool, it's probably not for you.  But if you've already talked about Peter and the Wolf and introduced the story to the class it is a very fun way to wrap up the piece.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|What super heroes would really be like... This movie was a real sleeper. It starts out with a quick statement and ends up with one of the most unlikely super heroes ever.
B007THA4FI|3.0|The characters are carefully drawn but I am about half way through the book, and we seem to have gone through about half the examples from a course in Abnormal Psychology I once took. I really do not believe that a child has to be assaulted early on to produce a mean or poorly adjusted adult. In other words, I don't believe that acts of my generation are responsible for all the flaws of the next generation. Thus, the book gets a bit tedious and I am searching for a few \\"normal\\" people.
B0094WK9GU|5.0|All I can say is WOW!!! This cd really hits the spot, one of the best cd's in EDM world. It's on repeat in my car since day one of the release date. Not disappointed by getting the deluxe version. Now on to SHM concert in March of 2013!!!
B008B56BZO|5.0|This album has a little bit of everything that you'd want.  For a bass player, it's especially sweet as Marcus blends a wide variety techniques elegantly, if not transparently, into a diverse, but coherent collection of  songs.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|The journey of the demigods continues - love the trials the demigods must endure. Reading the tales of Percy Jackson and his friends is a great way to learn about Greek & Roman mythology. Only problem is that because it is part of a series you have to wait until the next books is published to find out what happens.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This author has only one theme which is to appeal to the prurient interest of the reader.  The more lurid the details of sexual activity the better in the mind of the author.  I will skip the rest of the trilogy.
B005OT2YVA|4.0|I didn't have a lot of high hopes for this movie, but still wanted to see it and surprisingly it was pretty good.  Actually, it was better than pretty good.  Of course it's a Michael Bay which means the camera view changes every 3-5 seconds, but get passed that and the story actually made sense and the acting was decent.  It's a good movie to just sit back, watch, and enjoy.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Season 4 is crazy good. I love this show it is one of my favorites on tv right now. there is no other show like it that I can think of. all seasons are a must own.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|I wasn't expecting to get it in the mail so quickly.  I opened the packaging and the movie looked so snug in the nest it was shipped in.  Arrived in perfect condition.  I enjoyed Terminator 2 in the theater when it was released because of all the effects and stunts.  This BluRay disc recreated that experience!
B000T412OU|5.0|A wonderful thrilling movie, kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time.  Loved all the characters too.
B008R4ZCY0|5.0|Very well done in what I consider to be his new uber-prog style...love it! Really great production quality! He is a true master of his craft and I love seeing his development as a musician.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|This movie has almost everything you want in a movie. I liked the idea of visiting an alien planet to find our origins. Ridley Scott did a great job with this one. The only problem I had was there was too much of the movie. I fell asleep and had to start it over again.

B000XUBFE2|1.0|I did not like it at all.  I would not recommend it to anyone. I only made it about 30 pages in and deleted it from my kindle.<br />Weird book. I give it a zero rating because they do not have anything lower than that. Save your money.
B008ACC9CM|5.0|I get confused when I read reviews and listen to people. It's hard to figure out what brings people to comment in a negative manner here.

1432794426|5.0|I am by no means an MJ expert, but I found this book to be inspiring, informative and well written. It has truly opened my eyes and allowed me to find a new appreciation for a man whose music I've always enjoyed. Now I can better understand what Michael Jackson was up against and his many contributions that go far beyond the world of music.
0763650447|5.0|This super cute, oversize picture book will be a big hit with your little ones.  The bright colors in the illustrations are fun and inviting.<br /><br />There is just enough text on each page to keep things moving so that young children will stay interested.  The vibrant colors and silly words are what make this book such a treat!
B001P06GX4|5.0|I am an instructor for the Summer Institute for the Gifted and at SIG I teach game strategy to 5-6 year old gifted children.  One of the games I use in this course is Blokus.  I highly recommend Blokus to any parent who wants to help their 5-7 year old have fun learning to be smart.<br /><br />The beauty of Blokus is that the rules are incredibly simple so a young child can learn them quickly, in under two minutes, and yet the strategy and thinking levels needed to get increasingly better at this game are quite complex.  This combination is exactly what makes a great game to teach critical thinking skills to young children.  Specifically, Blokus helps children develop spacial reasoning abilities, problem solving and perseverance.  It also can begin to develop thinking ahead skills.  But, this game is as hard as your child is ready for in that a child can play it and have fun before these capabilities are fully developed and have a blast while improving these skills and as their skills increase they can engage the game at higher degrees of complex thought.  With repeated play, you will see your child's thinking skills improve.<br /><br />My oldest daughter just turned five and we gave this to her for her birthday yesterday.  We have already played four times.  She loves it and we love seeing her work through the spatial constraints and opportunities the board gives you each turn.  You will hit a homerun if you give Blokus to your child as a gift both as a fun parent and a parent who helps to raise a smart child.

B008BD9SI8|5.0|The western seems to be a long neglected theme for popular novels these days, but I'm glad it's come back with this writer -although with a twist. Joe is exceptional at creating gritty, exciting epics, and his a very visual style that uses exacting vocabulary seems to bring everything to life. You can easily imagine the dirt under the fingernails of some of these characters. He is of course from the fantasy stable of authors, so I'd view this is a successful side step for him, but if you also like gritty fantasy then you should try his other books as well as [[ASIN:0345459407 Perdido Street Station]] By China Miéville or [[ASIN:B009KVBC20 Into The Trees]] By the little known J. Alastair Nash. Both are gems!
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Hunger Games is a Great movie I can't wait to watch the second one when it comes out next year!
0385344228|2.0|I read this book for Book Club.  It was a quick read.  Pretty entertaining if you are looking for an easy story with little depth.  I found the insertion of the \\"murder gene\\" idea to be pretty silly.  Anyone involved in the court room process probably would too. I also found the characters to be very poorly developed--esp Jacob.  I did not feel like I knew Jacob at all at the end of the book.  Shouldn't we know what made him tick?  What is he thinking?  Instead, I was left totally unsatisfied regarding this character.  The story sufferred for the sake of an OMG \\"shocking\\" ending. The events on Jamaica were totally predictable.  The later car \\"wreck\\" was not.  But neither was it in any way believable.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|Without going too far to establish my bona fides, I'll simply state that I'm a long-time fan of Diana Krall's jazz oeuvre.  That out of the way, I read the reviews of Glad Rag Doll with dismay, believing that so many knowledgeable, articulate reviewers couldn't be wrong, this album was a misfire.  But I decided to give it a try on Rhapsody nonetheless.  What a surprise -- I immediately ordered 4 copies, for myself and for the coming gift season.  I couldn't disagree more with several reviewers who said, in effect, Diana, stick with what you do so well, that we know and love you for.  Yes, it's different, but to my ear her voice easily covers these honky-tonk, boozy-bluesy songs with a delightful balance of huskiness and silk.  At this point I personally have a sufficient collection of Diana covering the great jazz songbook.  This is a fresh and lively departure, the songs are lovely, with tastefully mixed instrumentation that you'd expect.  In short I love it, and recommend you give this album a try before dismissing it based on other reviews as I nearly did!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app is soo fun. a 6 year old I know loves this game. all you that say it is a copy of temple run I think this app is different. #1 you are on a railroad not in a temple. #2 this app has hoverboards and special boxes. it is similar to temple run in some ways. I think this oz a great app. PLUS its free.(this game is great for when there is a hurricane. Just saying.)(that hurricane. is sandy)

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game. Great for the whole family! Each level gets a little harder to get the prides and different puzzle pieces.
B00607EWYC|3.0|I wanted to really like this book, but I was disappointed by too many things. There are passages where the writing is beautiful and it carried me willingly where Harding wanted to go. Then I'd hit other places where the writing was self-indulgent or deliberately obtuse. Not every novel has to drip with symbolism and layers to be meaningful. These characters are interesting and sharing just one threaded theme among them would have been enough. I appreciated getting to the end and realizing that the story had been laid out from the beginning, but you just don't know enough yet to get that. With another book that would make me want to read it again to see what I missed. But Tinkers tries to do too much and does itself a disservice overall.
0812992784|5.0|\\"Joseph Anton\\" is a brilliant and moving memoir of the past 20 odd years of Salman Rushdie's life as well as the shared history of our collective lives during these years.  I want to add my voice to applaud the greatness of this writer in universalizing his personal story into the epic and mythic global story it really is.  For years the life of a humble, private, bookish writer was under constant death threats by Muslim extremists and the British Secret Service forced him into hiding for over 10 years while the threat turned out to be only the prelude to 9/11.  Rushdie's love of life and family and love for the principle of free speech carried him through these long, lonely tumultuous years.  I think his book is a beautiful work of art and beautiful testament to his humanity.  As I read through Rushdie's long, anxious years, his fears leaped out of the book's pages and pierced my heart.  Threats against freedoms faught and won hundreds of years ago arch across the years from one religion's extremists to the extremist's of another religion.  I can't help but feel the same anxiety for my life by the threats against women by the American Taliban in the Republican Party.

B000NA2BEU|5.0|I dunno why, but I really loved this show. I recently saw some re-reuns on Soap.net and had to re-watch the entire show. I've never seen the season 4 pitch before (an extra bonus on this set) and I'm sad it never made it there.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|There is always something that spurs you to upgrade your technology.  In 1999 it was the special edition dvd of Aliens that made me switch from vhs to dvd before I even had a dvd player, and now I've bought the dvd/blu-ray pack before even owning a blu-ray player.<br /><br />I've been a huge Marvel fan for the better part of 30 years, and a Joss Whedon fan since the Buffy and Angel shows.  Joss has given so much respect to the characters and the fans with this movie that I wish he could direct every Marvel movie from here on out.  I saw the movie in the theater and it holds up great on repeat viewings at home.  I'm looking forward to watching the bonuses on the blu-ray.  The digital copy will come in handy for my commute on public transportation.
0061120073|5.0|This is one of those literary classics I'd always known about, but never got around to reading till I was an adult.  This book was well worth the wait.  Perhaps I loved and enjoyed it even more as an adult instead of a teenager.  It has all the hallmarks of the classic fiction I love--well-developed, rich, complex characters you feel like you're friends with by the end, a rich backstory for each character, wonderful historical details, a well-described historical backdrop that yet doesn't overwhelm the reader by constantly calling attention to the past era, an episodic structure instead of being plot-centric, the now-underused third-person omniscient POV, a slower pace that develops the story bit by delicious bit instead of racing from Point A to Point B within 288 pages, and a story focused more on characters than stakes, action, and some kind of formulaic three-part act.<br /><br />While in many respects, the world Francie grows up in has advantages over the modern world (a slower pace of life, valuing family more, kids who love reading from an early age, understanding the value of money), in many ways, I'm glad to know this is history.  It was so emotionally difficult to read about things like the treatment of Francie's neighbor Joanna, a 17-year-old single mom who dared to go out in public with her baby and show her love; Francie being shamed out of the special gift of left-handedness by her own mother, and never questioning why her natural inclination was wrong; a doctor and nurse who think poor children are sub-human; teachers who mistreat students simply for being poor; and hard-working people having a hard time catching a financial break.<br /><br />Initially I was kind of disappointed that the pace picked up so much later in the book, going through important historical events and long stretches of time so relatively quickly, but I guess that it makes sense, since Francie was a teenager by then.  Time seems to pass more slowly when we're kids, and then passes more quickly as we get older.  I do wish there'd been more coverage of things like the influenza epidemic and World War I, but the purpose of the story wasn't to be a historical epic.  It's a Bildungsroman about a poor girl and her family as they experience life during some historic times.  The only really negative moment I had in the book was the part where Francie had an instalove of sorts with a young soldier.  It just didn't seem to fit with her well-established character.  I was glad when that storyline was over.<br /><br />It really strikes me how a book like this would have a hard time getting published these days, because it's so slow-paced and quiet, focused on character over action, doesn't really have a plot structure, Part II is the backstory of Francie's parents and grandparents, tells more than shows, and doesn't really have any stakes other than the Nolans wanting to get out of poverty.  And yet those are the things that make it such a classic and wonderful book.  This is the type of book that wasn't written for people with a ten-minute attention span.  It was written for people who enjoy a slow, well-crafted story that takes us through the ups and downs of life with beautifully-written characters.  It's not meant for people who want to be hooked in the first line or who won't read anything that doesn't have a lot of action or high stakes.  I think this is going to be one of those books I remember in detail years later, as though I just read it for the first time yesterday.s more quickly as we get older.

B0058EJJSM|5.0|This is a great album. I have the vinyl version but have not been able to listen to for years. I was at this concert in 1976 at St. Paul, MN.<br />The only grip I have and it's not really a problem is that when it down loaded to my Windows music, the album was mixed up ie: the songs were not in order. No big deal. I love the album!

0316228532|3.0|3.5/5<br />Well, I really don't think there's anyone who is not familiar with the name J. K. Rowling. The Harry Potter books will forever be part of our culture. So, with that series ended, Rowling's announcement that she was writing an adult novel was greeted with much (much!) anticipation.<br /><br />And with it's publication - much scrutiny. As a fan of the Potter books, I had to read The Casual Vacancy.<br /><br />\\"6.11  A casual vacancy is deemed to have occurred :<br />(a)  when a local councillor fails to make his declaration of acceptance of office within the proper time; or<br />(b) when his notice of resignation is received';<br />or<br />(c) on the day of his death...\\"<br /><br />And in the parish of Pagford, England, it's option (c) when councillor Barry Fairbrother unexpectedly dies. The local council is warring amongst themselves. The issue? Who should be responsible for the local estate - referred to as The Fields. Should it be Pagford or neighbouring city of Yarvil. This vacancy offers up the chance to turn the tide for one side or the other...the race is on to fill the seat....<br /><br />'Both, as they watched....were contemplating the casual vacancy: and they saw it not as an empty space but as a magician's pocket, full of possibilities.\\"<br /><br />Rowling rapidly introduces us to a plethora of characters. Each is well-drawn and provided me with  vivid mental images. Inthe beginning I did have to make myself a reference list of characters and their relationships until I had a firm grasp of who was who.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy is driven by it's characters. Most of them are not nice people. But it's an interesting social commentary. The 'better-offs' in Pagford are quite sure they are above those 'lower classes' living in The Fields. But our behind the scenes view allows us to see that they are no different from each other. The Pagfordians are just more polite about it.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy is not a small book - it's five hundred pages long. Although I'm a voracious reader, it took me almost two weeks to finish. Why? Well, packed into that five hundred pages is a lot of pettiness, bullying, selfishness, cruelty, vindictiveness, conniving, scheming...you get the picture. And it made me sad, just really sad. I really didn't get much enjoyment from reading this book. But I soldiered on, determined to see what happened at the end. Which I didn't like. The one character I enjoyed met a depressing fate.<br /><br />Rowling's writing is impeccable, the town and the machinations of it's inhabitants are all part of a tightly woven plot and her characterizations are spot on. So it's going to be a very hard book to rate for me. The writing is a four, but my enjoyment was only a three, so I'll go with 3.5/5.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy is definitely an adult novel, with lots of profanity, drug use, self harm, sexual situations and more.es long.

B0098VXN2Y|3.0|This movie was not as funny as I had hoped. Although the stories were interesting, it was a little slow. I thought it would be more about the humorous aspects of being a parent.
0741470314|1.0|I had already had a grudge against post 6-25 fans, so why on Earth I bought this book, I have no idea. I knew 99% of the factual material in the book and can pick out 99% of the b.s. in this book. I have read a lot of great books about Michael Jackson and this was not one of them. I should have stopped on page 13 where the author writes: \\"Michael Jackson sought no revenge against anyone; he always took the high road. He issued no public statements against any of the people who chose to become his enemies...even though he could have commanded a public platform and free publicity...if he had chosen to do so.\\" PAGE 13! Any MJ fan knows he lashed out against Tommy Mattola on a double decker bus no less. This book is a waste of money and the author WAS NEVER EVEN A FAN! I am 30 y.o. and have been a huge fan since age 3! I now know why MJ's bodyguards would not work with her. But here's the sick part, she stole their idea for the title of the book THEY want to write (for real fans) and is now profiting from Michael's death. I would highly recommend \\"My Friend Michael\\" by Frank Cascio to anyone who is tired of the same old biography written 50 different ways. Frank Cascio and his family were closer to Michael than most of his own family. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AND DEFINITELY NOT FOR THIS LADY'S PROFIT!!
B0058YPILY|5.0|I think this is one of \\"Criminal Minds\\" best seasons!  The team acted more like a family than just co-workers!  This season was more heartfelt than any of their othr seasons.  I truly enjoyed every episode of season 7!

B002UM5BXW|3.0|After reading this bombastic and profane book, I have concluded that I must be far more naive than I ever imagined.  Due to media coverage, I WAS aware of the drug life that so many Actors, Athletes, and Musicians choose to live, but NOT Chefs!!!<br /><br />The best part of this book was Bourdain's ability to write a well written and unique story.  I have always greatly admired people who started at the bottom in an occupation, sport, etc and then rose to the top by taking risks and making mistakes.<br /><br />The very worst part of this book was his use of degrading comments about women, sex, and the vulgar language used to refer to sexual organs.  I got the impression that he has virtually no respect for women and only respects men who have had many sexual conquests and lives a substance abused life.<br /><br />I seriously think that Bourdain is a very intelligent man and COULD HAVE written his book with the same impact without all of the \\"F\\" words and vivid descriptions of sex and drug abuse.  How could anyone choose to be a Chef after all the violence, anger, frustration, impossible owners, and substance abuse that he revealed in this book?<br /><br />The positive outcome of writing more of a PG-13 book would be that SO many young adults could read it and learn from his experiences.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My kids love mindcraft, and lego's.  Now both are together in this toy.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I am a 29-year old mother of a 7-year old so I usually find out about these \\"young adult\\" books well after the initial fire has died down. I was slow to read the Harry Potter series (loved it); slow to read Twilight (adored it) and have just completed the Hunger Game series, probably my favorite of the three. Because of the popularity of the film, my seven-year-old stepson was very interested, so we have had some amazing conversations regarding the treatment of fellow human beings, how American society compares to other cultures both present and past, and the possibility of a 'Hunger Games'-like reality actually being a reality for the future. It is very valuable to discuss these life lessons with the children and to hear their input. The concepts of these books are not too off-base from historical occurrences, nor do they seem an inplausible future. While I think she's a bit too young yet to read the books themselves, we have enjoyed discussing central themes as a family.
B008MU8ZNO|4.0|OK, this is what was once reffered to as a \\"B\\" rated movie.  Nothing special, but at the price it was nice to see a movie that I hadn't seen in about 10 years. And it was a Blue Ray for better viewing.
B001RCD2DW|3.0|I've had my pair of AKG702's for about 6 months now.  The sound is great and I'll let the audiophiles comment further on that.  What I want to say is that I caution people who plan on wearing these headphones for long periods of time.  I wear my pair for about 8-12 hours every day in the office while I work.  After a few months of wearing them I noticed that I had weird divots on the top of my head where my headphones rested.  It turns out they are caused by the pressure of the hard 'ribbed' form factor of the head band.  Over time they have only gotten worse and I am sure that if I shaved my head it would be very apparent.  The band was never very comfortable but the ribbing makes it worse and now, 6 months later, my head is deformed.
1607066017|5.0|This book is bold, original and engrossing. The cover featuring a nursing mother makes an immediate statement that separates Saga from other comics on the shelf. There has never been a shortage of stories about intergalactic wars but I'm not familiar with one that takes such an intimate perspective. The protagonist family is far more relatable than the usual starship captain or space marine. There is graphic sex and violence, but rather than being gratuitous it underlines the humanity of the characters and the importance of what's at stake.<br /><br />And what's at stake for the clashing forces in this book? The life of an newborn, the freedom of a six-year-old, and the future of an unborn child. A lot more interesting and personal than fighting for planetary domination.
B00006GO9Q|5.0|What can i possibly say about this recording that has not already been said by so many other reviewers.<br />If you love music, this cd is brilliant.<br /><br /> If \\"Kind of blue\\" is a diamond, \\"In a silent way\\" is pure gold,  both very precious but in very different forms.<br />Jazz for the dreamers.

It has Bruce Wayne struggling with his past issues and with his present condition (aging, etc.) He always comes through as the one and only Batman; protector of greedy soulless Gotham City.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|I admit it. I only bought this book because I was intrigued by the movie previews. My initial reaction when I started reading the book was: \\"Why didn't I read this sooner!\\" The story is centered around a teenager, Charlie, who is starting high school after loosing his friend to suicide. He has a history of mental health issues and everyone is watching to make sure he doesn't snap. Charlie meets step siblings, Sam (a girl) and Patrick, a pair of seniors who are surrounded by a strange cast of characters. This group of outcasts give him acceptance and unconditional friendship. However, things become very complicated by the fact that Charlie falls in love with Sam and doesn't know how to navigate through those feelings. The story moves through the shadowy parts of human emotion, self awareness and emotional survival. This is not a novel for the faint of heart. There are very raw passages describing drug abuse, sexual situations and self destructing behavior. While difficult to read because of its perfectly crafted writing, they are not gratuitous add-ons but actual contributions to the plot. This is not just a \\"coming of age\\" novel. This novel will pull you in and inevitably you will relate to one of its characters. Charlie will enter your heart and you will want to keep him there. The writing is absolutely amazing with simple and clear language. This book speaks plainly and precisely directly to the reader. I am willing to say that \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is a real treasure of American Literature.
B009VB97EY|4.0|I thought Channing Tatum was excellent and I never thought I'd say this, but one can only see so many strip routines in a movie before you have to ask \\"where is the storyline????\\" The back story was slow moving but overall it had a good ending.

Dogs hate that thing.

B008B11RLQ|5.0|I'm a newbie with Elvis. I never was a fan, but started to dive into his life and music recenty, and honestly find myself really appreciating this mans magic and talent. Elvis 70's stuff I really enjoy the most. Anyway, I collected a couple of the hits cds and the 5 Legacy Editions which are really nice, but I've have been waiting for some complete Elvis Catalog Box Set to come out. The Complete Masters Collection was released a few years back but is outrageously priced. When this came out, I ordered it right away and it was exactly what I was waiting for. This box contains the majority of Elvis studio releases, and most, it not all of his 70s LPs. The SOUND IS EXCELLENT. The mastering is clean and clear. The packaging is very nice with mini lp replicas and an informative book. Some have pointed out that a few songs were missing, and other songs added. I assume the additions were just copies of the Legacys Editions which had extra tracks. I havent analzyed the discs contents closely, but to this Elvis newbie, I think this set is Awesome. I wish all classic bands would package all their CDs into one mini LP box set.

0316228532|2.0|The Casual Vacancy by J. K. Rowling<br /><br />This is the story of a death:  The death of Barry Fairbrother, a member of the Pagford Parish Council and how it affects the town of Pagford.  Ms. Rowling introduces us the the very characters of the town:  Howard Mollison, first citizen of Pagford (in essence its mayor) - who was running the city and wanted to have the bad section of town called \\"The Fields\\"--where low income people lived and drug addicts went to The Bellchapel Addiction Clinic for methadone supply--shut down and sent to Yarvil--the neighboring and bigger town.  This is also the story of Howard's son, Miles, and the Mollison dynasty.<br /><br />The fuzz is against Catherine (Terri) Weedon, a drug addict, and her daughter Krystal a 16 y/o girl who was coached by Barry on the Winterdown school rowing team.  They represent everything the Mollisons want to rid  Pagford alongside with The Field.<br /><br />As the death produces a casual vacancy:  \\"What you call it when a council seat become vacant through a death.\\" (P. 35) factions ensue.  Howard wants The field to return back to Yarvil, and close The Bellchapel Addiction Clinic--mostly because Barry wanted it to stay open, and thus be good to Krystal--but also because Krystal had punched his granddaughter, Libby, and broken two if her teeth.<br /><br />Leading the fight to keep the clinic open after Barry's death, is Dr. Parmindel Jawanda--a General practitioner who was in love with Barry. she aligns with Collin (Cubby) Wall, Deputy headmaster of Winterton school.  But damning posts are hacked into the Pagford'ds website, thus ensuing tragedy for Colin, Pamindel, Simon, and Howard.  Their dirty laundry is exposed for all to see.<br /><br />Elections are held and both factions develop, particularly concerning whether to dissociate with \\"The Fields\\" -- which Barry supported an alliance with. However, those running for a place find their darkest secrets revealed on the Parish Council online forum by an user signing as The Ghost of Barry Fairbrother, ruining their campaigns and leaving the election in turmoil.  From the grave, all the lives of Pagford are affected by Barry.  As Howard says:  \\"Barry and the ghost are one and the same, a troublemaker alive and dead.\\"  (p. 383).  In a nutshell--the book is about Barry Fairweather and how he was connected to all the citizens in Pagford.<br /><br />Ms. Rowling takes us to her climax just as when Miles Mollison takes over the empty Parish seat; but a set of erratic events deprive the Mollisons of their total victory.<br /><br />I did not enjoy the book.  I thought it was poorly written.  Ms. Rowling narrates the story by using different points of view; but she keeps switching points of view on you so that you never know who's actually doing the narrating.  It reads slowly and the plot is petty. It's also predictable.<br /><br />As a fellow writer friend of me wisely said:  \\"...your first successful piece of writing is your best piece of writing--until you finally out achieve it with another piece of writing, terrifically new and phenomenally well done.\\"  (Ambidextrous by Felice Picano)  The casual Vacancy IS NOT the Harry Potter Series....igning as The Ghost of Barry Fairbrother, ruining their campaigns and leaving the election in turmoil.

B0092FEVBS|4.0|This 3 part BBC adaptation of the Anne Bronte novel runs 160 minutes total.<br /><br />Nicely shot, with a lot of surprisingly modern camera techniques for a Bronte novel.<br />Usually this works well, although occasionally it gets self conscious (a couple too<br />many 360 shots).<br /><br />The acting is solid, with Tara Fitzgerald an edgy but still empathetic heroine. But<br />Rupert Graves' switch from flawless seducer to \\"worst man in the world\\" type villain<br />is a bit over the top, although that may be the material, or approach more than<br />performance. Indeed, at times I could feel Graves (a very good actor) trying to<br />maintain some humanity under the almost gothic heartlessness.<br /><br />The music is interesting and effectively anachronistic as well, often sounding<br />something the Cocteau Twins, but as with the cinematography after a while it<br />starts to get both repetitive and too self consciously avant-garde for a story<br />mostly told in a straightforward Masterpiece Theater fashion.<br /><br />Lastly, the tidy ending bothered me a bit. The film did a good enough job capturing<br />the complex difficulties of life, that I found myself wish for something that felt more<br />honestly open ended.<br /><br />All that said, I still enjoyed the story, the scenery, and being transported into another time<br />and place as only good storytelling can do. A quite good adaptation, I just wished it was<br />great, and for 30 minutes or so, thought it might be.
0763644765|3.0|I like most of this book. It's easy to read and the colors are nice. The issue I have is with the 2 page multi-box spread that is difficult to keep my little one engaged followed by two pages of a baby yawning and a dog snoring. So 4 pages with no words but multi pictures. I tend to skip over them altogether. My daughter is 15 months and loves when I read but when there is too much pic overload without words she can get distracted. But, I do like the concept and the rest of the book.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|I knew beforehand that this movie was a prequel to the other alien movies, but thought that finding out how they came about would be interesting. I thought the plot was formulaic and the plot twists made me think the writers and producers just decided that instead of following the usual formula they would do a complete 180 on how the plot resolved itself which made a lot of the movie not make any sense at all.<br />The movie started out with an alien dropped off on ancient Earth drinking a dark liquid that causes his DNA to rip apart into tiny pieces and he disintegrated and fell into the waterfall he was standing next to. This causes his DNA to merge with other DNA fragments in the water and leap ahead however many thousands upon thousands of years and we see two archeologists finding a cave painting with big aliens pointing to a star formation which is similar to drawings they found in six or so other cultures.  Kind of the typical alien calling card, \\"Come see us when you figure things out and can travel across time and space.\\"<br />So they travel to the star system, find a planet and several underground passageways that will later be revealed to be a ship. The team is the usual you expect from the Alien franchise, the company man(woman), the scientists, the warriors and the android who seems to be up to his own agenda. It's no surprise at this point that only one of the female scientists would survive just like the unstoppable Ripley. She also gets pregnant with an alien creature that gets removed in a gruesome way.  Apparently, the aliens that spawned the human race did it so they could use the same thing that killed the alien they left on earth to wipe out all life on Earth.<br />The man who funded the mission reveals himself towards the end of the movie after having left a video message saying he was dead of old age by the time they arrived. This actually explains why the android was operating on his own, he was trying to find the aliens so they could \\"fix\\" the old man and give him eternal youth. Inexplicably, the alien they revive just starts roaring incoherently and killing everyone except for the lone female who escapes the ship just moments before the alien launches. A suicidal kamikaze attack using the ship they arrived in to ram the alien ship stops it from leaving the planet, but they jettison the luxury suite life pod moments before they kill hit.<br />Now or lone survivor goes to the life pod and searches for supplies only to stop when she hears a noise. Amazingly, that little creepy crawly turned into a monstrous creepy crawly and the alien who is now pissed and looking for her appears and they begin to fight it out until she \\"strategically\\" opens the door to the monstrous creepy crawly and it kills the alien, basically by wrapping itself around the alien and shoving something in its mouth. Needless to say, the queen alien rips out of the dead alien's chest and gives that famous double teeth smile.<br />The disembodied android head tells the last survivor that there is another ship which they use to leave the planet, but not to return to earth, no, they plan on finding the aliens home world to ask all the questions the audience is asking, such as, why did they create life on a planet just to destroy it with a biological weapon they nearly wiped the aliens that created it out? And why did we pay all this money for a movie that claimed it would reveal the beginnings of the aliens (okay, it did, it was an accident, really? A bunch of aliens want to kill us and \\"accidentally\\" start the series of events that creates the aliens) then left us with another unanswered question that will most likely go unanswered?<br />I was disappointed, if anything the android that was deciphering the door locks and knew how to control the ship could at least have found the time to read the alien captains log and said something like, \\"We are getting tired of visiting Earth, last time we were there we were mistaken for albino basketball players and paid too much for coffee from a place called Starbucks. The experiment is a failure, well just wipe the surface of the planet clean. Next we'll take a long nap in stasis and let the Earthlings come to us with our wakeup call so we can fly to their planet and wipe em all out. There is no way this would give them time to figure out a plan to stop us, we're bigger and by golly, smarter to as they will never figure it out.\\"<br />I am glad I only paid for a rental, I would have been disappointed to pay for a movie ticket or the DVD.

B009GENZ12|5.0|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />THE TALL MAN is based on a true story. Look around you. The poverty. The anguish. The suffering children. It is an emotionally charged ride. You will feel your heart pounding in your throat at times. You will cry at others. This movie brings action and emotion together in a way that few have. The concept is not cliche. If you like a movie that is anything but predictable horror-mill cut-and-dried tapioca flavored pablum, you will find this entertaining. you will find it quite thought-provoking. I think that is where a lot of people left the party. The drain on the brain falls mainly on the plain???<br /><br />I will highly recommend this movie, especially if you are looking for something out of the norm. However, if thinking is not your strong suit, maybe try an animated feature. Warning: Plot Twists Ahead, Proceed with Caution!<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review. I hope it has helped you. Please enjoy the movie. Hug you child, hold them close. Vigilance.

0307279189|4.0|It's time to start running again, but this time we must run the way nature intended - short, quick strides, not landing on the heel, light steps, and preferably...barefoot.  This book details the stories of several ultramarathon runners (50-100 miles or more!).  The author begins by telling of his own personal running troubles, pain, and frustration.  After experiencing near crippling pain, he saw multiple doctors and orthopedic surgeons for their opinions.  All of them agreed that running is an inherently dangerous and high impact activity, injuries are inevitable.  The author thought these opinions were a bunch of garbage, so he went on an epic journey that took him across the country and to the drug lands of Mexico.  Across the country he met with ultramarathon runners, learning about each person's background, motivation, and personal goals and accomplishments.  In the canyons and mountains of Mexico, he meets Caballo Blanco and the Tarahumara native american tribe.<br /><br />One of the main themes in the book is the Tarahumara and how these incredible indigenous people of Mexico can run for distances of 100 miles or more across rugged terrain in nothing but their bare feet or thin leather-soled sandals.  They grow up running, continue running, and never stop running, even when they're old and conventional wisdom would say they should be riding around in a Jazzy scooter instead of running upwards of 50+ miles.  The author does a good job describing the attitudes of this tribe and other serious runners.  He paints the picture of running not only being a basic human need, but also being one of the best answers to stress relief, lifelong health, happiness, and oneness with the world and nature.<br /><br />This book will open up a world of running that you never knew existed.  Although the author is not the best and his writing style and story telling can be very erratic at times, this book is a must read for the runner inside all of us.  If you are just starting to run it will give you the motivation and allow you to find joy in running rather than thinking of it as a chore.  Running is one of man's primal urges and needs.  It's time to get back to our nature and start running again.run it will give you the motivation and allow you to find joy in running rather than thinking of it as a chore.  Running is one of man's primal urges and needs.  It's time to get back to our nature and start running again.

B00068TJM6|4.0|Great everyday watch. I have small wrist so the 42 mm case diameter is nice. Not too heavy but not too light. Has a stop watch with split time. Screw down crown is nice but the same principal does not apply to the other buttons, i.e you need to \\"unlock\\" the other two buttons to press on them. Overall great watch. Has a tachymeter. Can't comment on the flight ruler/calculator since I don't use it. Black and yellow is a nice combo for me personally. Only bad thing is as with all watches that have stainless steel bands, they do scratch. I would definitely recommend this to anybody.

B002QYVPI4|2.0|alright i saw this movie yesterday in which i have to say it was a very interesting movie and kept me hooked until the end but for some reason i dont like the movie. ilike for example when Rutger Hauer (i forgot his name in the film) saved Deckard from falling to his death. i guess he felt compassion for him and was sick of killing or something of that nature but i truly dont understand why he saved him. the pacing of the movie seemed to be slow for me but like i said though the movie kept me hooked until the end. and another thing i didnt understand the unicorn scene. what it says on the back of the dvd case it says \\"the unicorn vision suggests Deckard may be a humanoid\\". i never in the movie thought that Deckard was a humanoid at all. i guess maybe an indication that he could have been is that he didnt take the test what Racheal suggested he should do because maybe she didnt think that he seemed human. i understand this directors cut cuts out the voiceover narration and removes the \\"uplifting ending\\" in which the directors cut ending i guess he was helping her go North to protect her because he loved her? one other thing (unless i missed it) i never got the indication that the other nexus 6 people wanted to be human except for Racheal and Rutger i guess at the end when he dies. im 19 so i may be a little young to truly understand this movie. For me i just considered it a let down because i heard this was one of the best movies ever. again i thought it was interesting movie and a creepy one that kept me hooked. should i buy the other version, am i truly missing something?
0425263908|4.0|I liked this series a million times better then 50 Shades of grey. Which felt like a was reading twilight with a few sex scenes. I like the nature of the main characters.

0425263916|4.0|In book 1 the couple meets and falls into a sex-all-the-time relationship.  This is book 2.  The first 200 pages are mostly just seeing the couple have a lot of sex.  There was not much story.  I wanted to see more happening between the couple - more relationship development.  I wanted more time spent on details and events with other characters: Cary, Corrine, and Nathan.  The last 100 pages intrigued me.  There was pain and separation.  I liked the way the subject of trust was handled.  I don't recall seeing \\"trust\\" done that way before.  The ending was very good.<br /><br />A crime is committed in this book which at first blush unsettled me.  It felt wrong.  Then I thought of other suspense books where bad guys are killed by the hero or heroine.  In those books it's ok because the hero is a military guy, in the security business, a cop, or going after bad guys for other reasons.  Something may feel odd here, but it should be acceptable as suspense genre.<br /><br />I was glad to learn a little more about the trauma that happened to Gideon in his past.  I believe I know who the bad guy was, but it wasn't spelled out clearly enough for me.

0399157565|3.0|I've read lots of Scarpetta novels, I guess not all 20, but lots.  I enjoy them because the main character is a competent woman, the other main characters are believable, the dialogue is current, and one does want to find out what happens. I think this is a better book than the last one because it focuses on Scarpetta herself, and she comes across as very real. But what doesn't work for me in this novel is a failure to present several possible, logical perpetrators of the crime throughout, so one never knows until the last who the guilty one is.  This book introduces the killer late and gives the psychological background for the crimes, but doesn't weave it all into the story line. There were several candidates for this treatment, but they weren't developed in this way, and one promising line in particular was just dropped somewhere along the way and never resurrected. It is all agreeable but less satisfying than it could be.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|Christopher Nolan's \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" is a beautiful, dark ending to his famous trilogy. While some Batman fans seemed frustrated by the way the film ends, I wasn't. This film is fantastic. The soundtrack is the first part of the film that stands out. It complements the action on screen perfectly. The film has four Academy Award winners acting in it, and it shows on-screen. Bale, Caine, Cotillard, and Freeman are all fantastic, as well as the other members of the cast, which include two Oscar nominees in Anne Hathaway and Gary Oldman. Tom Hardy is frighteningly scary as Bane. The film editing and cinematography work well together as they do in all of Nolan's films. This is just a great action movie.

B008RNYNDM|4.0|'Listomania' is not for everyone, and that needs to be said right up front.  But if you are in the mood for the kind of excess that only the 1970's can deliver, then brother, do I have the movie for you.  After considering 'Tommy' entirely too conservation, Ken Russell really let his freak flag fly on this cinematic monstrosity.  Of course, a garish psychedelic mind trip about a nineteenth century composer was destined to leave the mainstream baffled, and in truth the movie is a mixed bag, with some parts being brilliant, such as the concert sequence, while the ending feels rushed and weak.<br /><br />But Roger Daltry is surprisingly effective in a role much harder to play than a deaf dumb and blind boy, and the movie really shines when things get completely out of hand.  The ten foot penis scene is THE highlight of the movie and very well done, while the castle scene with the Nazi/Frankenstein references is also outstanding.  Musically, it works best during the instrumental parts, as Rick Wakeman does an admirable job with the classical pieces, while the vocal songs are definitely lesser.<br /><br />This movie, while having echoes of 'Tommy', is unique in the annals of movie history.  Never before or since has a director been able to go so far over the top.  It is a very funny movie with an amazingly high degree of creativity in the script, set designs, and props.  For a once-in-a-lifetime experience - and a total trashing of the classical music world by a guy who really knew what he was talking about, not to mention huge wads of 20th century history thrown in for good measure - put good taste and common sense on hold, and give 'Listomania' a try.

B007IXWL2C|2.0|Long before all the hype, before these books became so popular, I read these at a friend's suggestion, I'll just say \\"I just don't get it\\".  There are so many other books out there that are more erotic and interesting than this trilogy.  In my opinion the first of the three is the worst, certain things are mentioned over and over, like the lip biting, I would actually groan from annoyance for having to read it again and again.  I would not suggest this book.

Richard Mayhew finds himself trapped in London Below, hunted by Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar, two deliciously wicked villains who like nothing better than killing (except maybe torture). I loved the start of this dark fantasy--the gritty settings, the Oliver Twist dialogue--but slogging through tunnels and forgotten subway stations began to wear thin, as did some of the characters. The story was adapted from a BBC TV series, which explains why it feels more like a screenplay than a novel.

B0010SKSTO|5.0|To begin with, I, like everyone interested in this material, felt that I needed to improve upon my ability to read body language.<br /><br />This was the first entry in my education regarding body language and I doubt the a better text could have been available. The writing is top-notch, with well referenced data. The book is pristinely clear that there is no 'lie' or 'truth' tell, but that you need to interpret everything in context. Mr. Navarro routinely outlines clear behavioural patterns that you and I see everyday, but simply don't know how to interpret. He places a lens over our eyes and allows us to see everything through a seperate perspective.<br /><br />There's clearly thought out mantra's that hold fast throught the book (ie: gravity defying behaviour) that are easy to recognize, and the examples serve to accentuate his meaning. Some of the examples are a tad unbelievable (98% of criminal's apparently confess), but, the power of these 'tells' is conveyed well.<br /><br />All, in all, a fantastic book, that I intend to re-read in a few months, after I have become more apt at picking up subtle behaviours.

B008XNZMOU|4.0|Taylor Swift returns after a two-year hiatus with 2012's [[ASIN:B008XNZMOU Red]], arguably the year's biggest album, seeking to extend upon her previous successes (2008's [[ASIN:B001EYGOEM Fearless]] and 2010's [[ASIN:B003WTE886 Speak Now]]).  Red serves as more of a departure for Swift, delivering more pop sensibilities than previous efforts have exhibited.  This pop nature has been evidenced in full fruition via singles \\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\\" and \\"I Knew You Were Trouble,\\" both produced by one of pop's `it' teams in Max Martin and Shellback. Country may be ever so disappointed by Swift's pop stylings, though should appreciate the fact she balances enough singer-songwriter cuts. Overall, Red is another intriguing release by the 22-year old star.<br /><br />\\"State of Grace\\" opens possessing a sound pop/rock blend with country elements more understated and minimal here.  Written by Swift, she and Nathan Chapman produce the cut, characterized by pummeling drums and electric guitar.  Swift's songwriting remains sharp, most notably on the succinct, though emotive chorus: \\"And I never saw you coming, and I'll never be the same...\\" Ultimately, Swift `pitches' well here, with the only quibble being it's five minute length.<br /><br />\\"Red,\\" also penned by Swift, loses no momentum and successfully contrasts \\"State of Grace\\" by trending more country/pop than the opener. Lyrically, Swift continues to allure, promoting cutting edge lines like \\"Losing him was blue like I'd never known/missing him was dark grey all alone/forgetting him was like trying to show somebody you've never met/but loving him was red...\\" Ultimately, \\"Red\\" keeps the momentum afloat.<br /><br />\\"Treacherous\\" loses a bit of the luster of \\"State of Grace\\" and \\"Red,\\" but ultimately remains consistent.  Swift chooses a more restrained approach throughout, which is a pro.  She does covered ever so slightly on the bridge, which features more production and intensity than the majority of the song.  Pop cut \\"I Knew You Were Trouble.\\" is stronger, contrasting the restraint of it predecessor in favor of the pop gimmickry of producers Max Martin and Shellback.  Most shocking is on the incredible hook when Martin and Shellback throw in a dubstep bass line and whacky electro-influenced synths.  It shouldn't work, but Swift actually delivers more vocal edge and personality than we've experienced previously.  The songwriting suffers none: \\"Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in/so shame on me now, flew me to places I'd never been/'til you put me down/oh I knew you were trouble when you walked in/so shame on me now, flew me to places I'd never been/nowI'm lying on the  cold hard ground.\\" Verdict? A+.<br /><br />\\"All Too Well\\" atones for Swift's more country-leaning fans, opting for a more conservative direction and slowing down the tempo after the ferociousness of \\"I Knew You Were Trouble.\\" The cut possesses a sound rhythmic flow and the chorus is not concrete, but possesses lyrical variations given each iteration.  The main quibble is length, which clocks in at 5 ½ minutes<br /><br />\\"22\\" contrasts country, swapping for care-free pop: \\"Uh oh, I don't know about you but I'm feeling 22/everything will be alright if you keep me next to you/you don't know about me but I bet you want to/everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22, 22...\\" As always, Max Martin and Shellback provide Swift with an excellent backdrop.  There is little to quibble about here, but perhaps Swift does overreach vocally as she tries to soar. Overall though, \\"22\\" is sassily excellent.<br /><br />\\"I Almost Do\\" lacks the hit potential of the pop cuts, but maintains a sense of consistency.  Never fear as the feisty lead single \\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\\" proceeds, maintaining high energy.  One feels that Swift really `lets go of her cool' and is reveling in her youth.  The message may be stemmed out of a breakup/heartbreak, but Swift spins it as one of 2012's most fun and memorable songs: \\"We are never ever ever ever getting back together...you go talk to you friends talk/to my friends talk to me/but we are never ever ever getting back together...\\"<br /><br />\\"Stay, Stay, Stay\\" shifts gears incorporating ukelele, which gives the cut a folk-pop/tropical sound (think Colbie Caillat).  Swift is joined by Gary Lightbody (Snow Patrol) on the piano-driven \\"The Last Time,\\" which is slower in tempo, but yields some sound vocal chemistry between the two.  \\"The Last Time\\" works, but is a bit `sleepy.' \\"Holy Ground\\" proceeds, produced by Jeff Bhasker. Quicker possessing a country-rock sensibility, \\"Holy Ground\\" lacks the spark of the best, but remains enjoyable and consistent.<br /><br />\\"Sad Beautiful Tragic\\" features nice lower register vocals by Swift.  The balance between country and singer-songwriter idioms is well executed.  Bhasker produces once more on \\"The Lucky One,\\" which features more memorable lyrics from Swift. Both cuts are solid, but pale in comparison to \\"State of Grace,\\" \\"I Knew You Were Trouble,\\" \\"22,\\" or \\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.\\"<br /><br />\\"Everything Has Changed,\\" featuring Ed Sheeran, produces a cut that competes with the very best of Red.  Produced by Butch Walker and co-written by Swift and Sheeran, \\"Everything Has Changed\\" showcases superb vocal chemistry between the two.  The chorus works spectacularly: \\"Cause all I know is we said hello/and your eyes look like coming home/all I know is a simple name, everything has changed/all I know is you held the door/you'll be mine and I'll be yours/all I know since yesterday is everything has changed...\\"<br />\\"Starlight\\" bridges country and pop quite effectively, though stands out less than \\"Everything Has Changed.\\" \\"Begin Again,\\" a preliminary single, closes the effort solidly, though doesn't eclipse better singles.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B008XNZMOU Red]] isn't necessarily Taylor Swift`s best album compared to the quality of the work she's released, but shows Swift able and willing to stretch her wings.  The crossover appeal possibilities have already shown themselves and are evidence of why Red  will sell one million-plus its first week. Highly recommended.012's most fun and memorable songs: \\"We are never ever ever ever getting back together...you go talk to you friends talk/to my friends talk to me/but we are never ever ever getting back together...\\"<br /><br />\\"Stay, Stay, Stay\\" shifts gears incorporating ukelele, which gives the cut a folk-pop/tropical sound (think Colbie Caillat).

B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is a great movie.  My family has seen it several times and just loves it.  We highly recommend it.
B004VD3YIM|4.0|It has zoom!  Everything else we tried doesn't have zoom feature.  This works on our foscam, has some hiccups.  Such as connection problems on initial startup, going to \\"manage camera\\" and back to live view helps 95% of the time.  Crashes sometimes when switching between landscape/portrait.  These issues are seen both on the kindle fire and my samsung galaxy nexus.<br />Still I've tried most of the other programs and they were all worse.  I recommend you try the free version first.  I bought the pro but that was just to support the app.  I don't use any of the pro functions.

B009NQKPUW|3.0|Prometheus looked absolutely stunning  but the story was very weak and predictable. Definitely  is a movie worth checking out but if your looking for a great story your going to be disappointed.
B008CLI3TE|2.0|I was excited to watch this program after so much critical acclaim for it.  I found it to be exceedingly violent and gory, which adds absolutely nothing to the plot.  The acting seems quite good, but the plot really goes nowhere in the first five episodes, which is all I could stomach.  Really do you want to spend 10 hours of your free time absorbing all this negativity and violence into your soul?
0316228532|3.0|In the small English town of Pagford, everyone knows everyone else's business and privacy is a luxury. When Barry Fairbrother unexpectedly dies, the town is left with much unanticipated circumstances. A casual vacancy, as it is known on the town's Parish Council.  The town has been going through a long term political struggle over who is responsible for the costs of supporting the poverty stricken area, the Fields. Fairbrother was an ally of those who wanted to maintain support for the Fields, and with his death, the two opposing sides square off. The politics of the Parish Council only set the stage for the book. The turmoil is the stage for the real story about the variety of people who call the town home and their daily struggle in life.<br /><br />When the isolated town's main source of gossip, the Parish Council message board begins to receive anonymous posting revealing some of the characters deepest and darkest personal secrets, a town already struggling with the death of one of their biggest personalities must reconcile their own places in Pagford.  There are a multitude of characters in this book and at times it is hard to follow, but through the course of the book their diverse personalities, personal hardships, familial loyalty, and relationships are explored. What follows is a well told story that reaches the underbelly of society and the dark truth of its residents. Abuse, drugs, rape, teenage hormones, and sexual affairs are some of the few topics explored in the interwoven stories of the characters.<br /><br />This book was a struggle for me to start and I am still undecided about the end. The book really seems to not have a point to the plot, other than an exploration into the lives of the town's residents, but I cannot declare that I did or did not enjoy the book. Overall I am still undecided, and I think readers will also be torn. If you are seeking another Harry Potter phenomenon, you will be highly disappointed. This is a book for adults and the topics inappropriate for young adults and children.<br /><br />baseballvalbooks.wordpress.comtopics inappropriate for young adults and children.<br /><br />baseballvalbooks.wordpress.com
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I just love this book.  After losing a dear pet of my own, I know exactly what it's like.  Someone told my daughter to read this after she lost her black lab and she told me about it.  Can't say enough good things about it.  Wish they could make a movie out of it.  At first I thought it was going to all about racing and cars but it's more about life.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|over here in the UK Disney renamed the film Avengers Assemble which just doesn't sound right and when released on blu ray (spoiler for anyone who hasn't seen the film?) Agent Coulson's death scene has been edited to remove the tip of the spear coming through his chest, why?! it was in the theatrical version shown here....  On top of that 'error' the UK blu ray has less extras, no whedon commentary, no music video, thankfully the short Item 47 and deleted scenes are present. But overall this US version is far superior and also includes a DVD  of the best comic book super hero team up film yet
B0087HT36U|5.0|great game that plays well.great for all ages. highly recommend even for the kiddies to pass the time. great help on youtube if you get stuck.
B009VB97EY|1.0|Channing Tatum stars in this drama following his character Mike and The Kid, a guy Mike befriends played by  Alex Pettyfer. Mike decides to mentor The Kid and it shows how the lifestyle quickly takes over Kid while Mike is trying to leave the lifestyle.  Steven Soderbergh directed from a script by Reid Carolin, whose screenplay was inspired by Tatum's work as a stripper before he made it in Hollywood. Matthew McConaughey, Matt Bomer, Joe Manganiello, Cody Horn, and Olivia Munn co-star.<br /><br />This movie defintely does not live up to the hype!! Very disappointed, there was no plot and a lot of the storylines didn't make sense or fit with the movie. What was the point of the relationship between Mike and Joanna? The drug storyline?  There is a LOT of eye candy in this movie and it almost makes up for how bad it really is! Alex Pettyfer's character, The Kid really acted like a kid, he was sulking, pouting, or making bad decisions throughout the movie!<br /><br />The only good thing about this movie was Channing Tatum, he is a really talented dancer who can act, he just needs the right material. The scene where he danced to the song Pony was HOT!!!! Wait until this one comes out on cable!!

B009KHDT0C|5.0|Transformed into a vampire and entombed for 200 years after betraying vengeful witch Angelique Bouchard, 18th century fishing magnate Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) returns to Collinwood Manor in 1972, only to find his once proud estate in ruins and his family plagued by macabre secrets. It was the year 1752 when Barnabas' parents came to America to expand their business empire. But after establishing the thriving New England fishing town of Collinsport, the family experienced a series of misfortunes when Barnabas fell for the gorgeous Josette DuPres and cast aside beautiful witch Angelique, who cursed him with eternal life and buried him deep in the earth. Returning home to Collinwood Manor after being dug up by a construction crew in 1972, Barnabas learns that Angelique has nearly driven his family out of business, and turned the townspeople against them.<br /><br />I almost didn't buy this movie because there were so many bad reviews, I rented it first instead and I loved it! It is a typical Depp/Burton movie which means it's quirky and dark. Johnny Depp was great, the storyline was great. There were a few scenes that were over the top, (the love scene with Barnabas and Angelique) but overall, it was really enjoyable. Watch it and decide for yourself!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I loved the they had the verse for the day. It makes it very easy to stay in the word of god.
B008JAFXOQ|5.0|I just watched Margaret, and I watched Kenneth Lonergan's other movie, You Can Count on Me, last night. I was blown away by both. It's so rare that you see a movie--or read a novel, or see a play--with characters so complex; Lonergan never lets you totally side with one person or another but somehow finds a way to show how people are both good and bad, kind and cruel, etc. And I don't think I've ever seen the Molotov cocktail of teenage narcissism, cruelty, and vulnerability represented as well as it was in Margaret. It adds political depth to the film that the teenager monster who stars in the film aggressively defends the United States' War on Terror in her high school class discussions.

B009NQKPUW|4.0|I really enjoyed the storyline.  It made me think and remember portions of the first Alien movie.  Special Effects were great.<br />People wanting a simple blood & gore action film will be disappointed.  The Underlying themes in the story made it more interesting and drew me into the plot.  Would watch it again to see what little details I may have missed.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|fun app, though currently crashes the HTC supersonic / Evo 4G. Endless fun, reminds me of our cruise from last year and first from when I was a kid
B0090EHVMC|4.0|The kids couldn't get enough of this movie... And have been singing the songs ever since they watched it. I liked the over all theme of the movie... To take care of the things you have as well as nature/environment although I personally felt the movie pushed an agenda a little too strongly. But overall, it was a good movie to rent.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|The theme is that everything we do creates a ripple effect which will affect other lives in the future.  Or is it reincarnation? Or perhaps how we can master our worst instincts to become better beings? I'm still not sure. That said, I'd be willing to go on this ride again and again to see if I can come to a clearer understanding.<br /><br />The book is beautifully written, and an interesting exercise in stylistics when we're looking at language in the future - never mind a post-apocalyptic \\"culture\\" scrabbling for survival under what appears to be insurmountable odds.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas is not the easiest read, but I found it impossible to put down.

B00004W510|3.0|I guess I'm going to have to rip the original CD after all. I realize everyone knows more than the people who did the playing and mixing in 1969, but I can't listen to this version. I noticed the difference right after the intro in track 1, Across the Great Divide. The original loping Country feel of the song had been \\"remastered\\" into an annoyingly even, standard Rock n Roll rattle. There was a LOT of standard rock n roll in 1969 and what made The Band stand out was the unique rustic feeling of their songs. This ain't it. So, just a warning: if you loved the original mix, listen to the samples before you make the mistake I did.

The main character is a nice person that I felt sympathy for because he was honest and realy helpful to people. And of course the not so nice guys with lots of money and power and the usual persons that lacks character.<br /><br />If you like Grisham's book you will enjoy this book.
B008NABUU8|4.0|Honestly I do love this game, it is very challenging to the mind. Some levels are harder than others but for the most part it is not impossible. Now for the cons, the game freezes a lot not exactly during game play, but if the screen goes dark it freezes and if you open up another application during game play it freezes..... and to tell the truth that wouldn't bother me too much if the game didn't take so long to load..... but I wouldn't remove this game from my device, still love it... just hoping they give it a quick fix!!!!!!!!

I enjoyed it more than she enjoyed the scenery.<br />Denzel Washington has always been a good actor, but this time he was exceptional.  Chris Pine also did a remarkable job.  This is definitely one worth watching.  And worth watching more than once.

B005S9EJ14|1.0|The setting of this movie had some beautiful and not so beautiful shots -It made me sad that the characters had to live here -maybe the English found it quaint but at 61 -I could not imagine a more distasteful retirement -now an American retirement to Scotland? Maybe. The actors were familiar for the most part but the accents were very strong and difficult to understand. In full disclosure, I have difficultly with foreign accents. I gave the movie to my parents, who are in their 80's ,to watch -they are major Judi Dench fans. I wish I had rented it for a bargain price -I paid way to much. Not a fan.
B002XGRSBI|5.0|I'm a big Beatles and McCartney fan but have been waiting for the right McCartney DVD before buying. Reviews of previous DVD's have been very iffy.  The reviews of 'Good Evening New York City\\"  have been much better.  So I bought it -- and decided to get the deluxe version. WOW, I am glad I waited and I am glad I got the deluxe version -- with the David Letterman concert.  Trust me, if you are thinking about buying a McCartney DVD, get this one and get the deluxe version for  a few bucks more.  Two and a half hours.Seeing McCartney and Wings on top of the Letterman marquee in NYC is worth a few extra bucks -- the feel of the street crowd is amazing.  The video quality on both DVDs is simply great. Details aren't necessary -- trust me, no significant criticisms on that end.  The audio quality is very good -- two live shows -- you're not going to get studio quality effects.  But the sound is super clean.  You really get the feel of being at both the Letterman and the stadium show.  The mixing on the stadium song \\"I'm Down\\" is terrific -- they mix the Beatles Shea Stadium performance in with the stadium performance.  And McCartney is in great voice on both shows.  That is notable since he has had some ups and downs in other performances. Somehow, I had not been aware of some of the more recent McCartney songs (don't listen to radio much anymore) and had not heard \\"Sing the Changes.\\" What an amazing song. It has to be one of his top five songs ever.  It simply launches off the stage -- it is a joyous celebration.  You simply cannot hear this song and not love it. The production on that song in the stadium just lifts you out of your seat -- the energy. Clearly, McCartney loves it as well, given the enthusiasm he clearly brought on that song. Probably the most exciting song I've heard in a couple of years. Get the deluxe DVD -- you'll love it.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Ok, so I started reading this book out of curiosity.. And I really enjoyed it. It has a pretty good plot line, although sometimes the descriptive words are a bit repetitive, which gets pretty boring after a while. And sometimes it's pretty obvious a thesaurus has been used. The thing is though, this book leaves you a little unsatisfied, and for this book to make sense, you have to read the next two (which focus a little less on the sex scenes, and more on developing the plot and characters). But definitely worth a read, even if just to see what the fuss is about.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|All the book reads like a porn version of a cheap romantic novel!  Is people really so desperate to read about wild sex? I was dissapointed!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Rarely do bands who have been around as long as Rush have continue to put out albums as significant as this. Clockwork Angels finds Rush, almost 40 years into their career, at an artistic and creative peak. Never ones for complacency, Rush have continued to challenge themselves (and their fans) with every album. Clockwork Angels shows a band still `firing on all cylinders'.<br /><br />Things get off to an energetic start with a pair of tunes released 2 years ago - the almost Metallica-like Caravan and the hard hitting BU2B (Brought Up To Believe). Both songs are slightly remixed here from their original versions, especially BU2B which contains a new intro. The tunes are essentially the same but have updated to fit in with the sound of the rest of this `concept' album. Things continue to move along with the title track, with it's timing changes and various influences proves to be a feast for any Rush fan. The 4th track The Anarchist is a highlight with it's almost throw-back sound of early 80's Rush.  Carnies starts off with one Alex Lifeson's dirtiest riffs ever and propels itself into being one of the many highlights of this album. Things slow down a bit (in a good way) with the most ballad like tune since Losing It, with Halo Effect. But quickly pick up again with Seven Cities of Gold, which contains a riff that wouldn't sound out of place with Rage Against the Machine. My personal favorite from the album - The Wreckers - comes next with one of my favorite Rush chorus's! The prog-like Headlong Flight is an aggressive and tough tune that is proving itself as a `live classic' on their current tour. BU2B2 is a cool little segue into  Wish Them Well... probably the most basic tune on the album, but what it lacks in complexity it more than makes up for with its 'catchiness' and inspiring lyrics. Things end on a high note with what is probably one Rush's best closing songs - The Garden, a gorgeous mid-tempo song that showcases Lifeson's talent as a soloist.<br />I won'tgo too deep into the concept.  I feel it isn't what makes this a great album. I will say that the story is pretty cool and after a few listens does become more and more clear, but honestly it's just icing on the cake. For me what makes this such a classic album is the passion and fury Rush plays with. This truly does sound like a unified piece of work. The sound is consistent through out. Even though this is considered a concept album, the songs also have a universal meaning that transcend the story. Each song stands on it's own so it isn't like they sound out of place when listened to individually. I've read reviews saying there aren't any `hooks', but I tend to think the opposite. I felt their last 2 albums (Vapor Trails and Snakes & Arrows) were very dense and layered, and as much as I like those albums, the melodies weren't as easily recognizable or even apparent. Here things are a little simple... each instrument stands out more and as a result the songs make more of a musical statement. So for me, I feel as though Clockwork Angels actually has more hooks... not that hooks is what makes a great Rush album, but for me this has everything I want in a Rush album - great playing, solid songwriting, passion, inspiring lyrics and solid production. Yes, solid production. Again, I've read reviews from fans complaining about the sound. Honestly, I think it sounds great. Maybe even better than their last album and certainly better than Vapor Trails (which was a brick-walled mess).  Neil Peart's playing through is thunderous and inspired. Alex Lifeson, who on Snakes & Arrows has sounded amazing continues to impress and Geddy Lee's bass is more upfront than it has been in many years (which maybe be why this feels like an older Rush album). Also Lee's vocals are solid throughout - much more intense than he has been in the last 20 years.<br /><br />I realize this may not be what every Rush fan wanted. Especially fans of the 70's or early 80's, but for a fan like myself whoenjoys all the various stages of Rush, this album was a real treat! Over the last 2 months I've tried to complete the sentence \\"This is the best Rush album since - \\" and I haven't been able to finish it yet. I can honestly say I've thoroughly enjoyed almost all of Rush's albums, including the last 2. But obviously some I enjoy more than others. So maybe their best album since Counterparts? Yeah most likely. Their best since, say, Signals? Maybe. Which means this could their best since Moving Pictures... that maybe be a pretty big statement, but one that may be true.
B007NESBK2|5.0|What else do I have to say that other reviewers didn't? This Blu-Ray is a precious gem. Amazing sound/image quality. Brilliant performances from all the members in the band (this is a superb band). Find any superlative in the dictionary and you'll find a way to describe this wonderful singer/artist. Her fabulous music will live forever. Thank you again, Sade.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|its your basic calculator,easy to use.I did not think i would use it as much as i do,but with 3 kids it get used quite a bit.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I downloaded this book because it was free and I wanted to see if it included anything that I didn't already know.  For those who use MS Word and perhaps aren't familiar with everything it can do such as table of contents, ect, this free book is great.  It will walk you through steps by step and give you some practical tips for getting your kindle book to show up just the way you want it.  Most of the information in this book can be found if you go looking but it is great to have it all here together in one place.  To sum up my review, the book is well written and provides great information for people who are new to kindle publishing.  If you have the experience and you know how to get your kindle book looking great you might not need this book.
B000ZM1FXO|2.0|Movie kept freezing, and the dialog keep hesitating, all in all the acting wasn't as good as I had hoped, but I at least got the jist of the movie.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|It was a little too campy for me. I love supernatural and vampire flicks but this one just didn't do it for me.

B0099G6Q5E|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie and the mashups of the songs are cool to listen to. I didn't think I'd like the songs, but I was really impressed with their a capella skills.
091581112X|5.0|I highly recommend this book! It has very useful meditations and the writing style is simple and useful. The concepts are amazing and I swear that almost every problem/issue I've had in my life has been addressed in this book and offers a plausible solution or method of solving it. :)I have purchased all of Sanaya Roman's books, and this one and the Soul Awakening are the two books I mostly recommend.

B0072OFOM6|5.0|The only thing that dissapoints is the end...I want more!!<br />The Old hero is missed when viewed in succession, but the new guy makes you forget about it by the second episode, and all the familiar characters are spot-on, or better.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|Ending was weak, but overall good.  Great special effects and good story.  Ending could have been beefed up and made stronger.
B002UJIY70|5.0|A thoroughly enjoyable film. Like so many other reviewers here, I found this DVD by following what seems by now to be a very well-trodden line of breadcrumbs from Timothy Olyphant's other work, notably Deadwood. I'm not certain I would like every single scrap of film he has made (as yet I've avoided the science fiction), but from what I have seen so far I am beginning to suspect that Olyphant never turns in a bad performance. (For example, although I'm a female with zero interest in video games, I loved Hitman.) In this case Kiele Sanchez helps matters out with her usual contagious smile and warm charm, while Steve Zahn is marvelous in a role slightly different from his normal ones. Puerto Rico, disguised as Hawaii, is charming as well, making the whole ride gorgeous to behold. Knowing in advance that there was a \\"twist,\\" I did guess it soon in - mostly because it was so logical - but I didn't feel much conviction because I wasn't certain that such a dramatic turnaround could work. In the end, however, I thought it worked just fine. I must confess, though, that my husband, sitting beside me, was gnashing his teeth with frustration soon into the movie, protesting that the plot made no sense whatever. My own suspicion is that this difference is less about believability than the fact that I have much more tolerance for slicing and dicing in movies than he does (he's fine with guns). I mean, his favorite film is Vertigo. That it's a masterpiece we both agree, but is it really all that \\"plausible\\"? On the other hand, when knives come out he and I normally agree that I'll tell him when it's safe to open his eyes again. So perhaps I should add a warning that people who greatly dislike seeing knives come out and \\"blood\\" spill in movies should think twice here. Otherwise, though, just have a good time!
B008H6GH8I|5.0|Overall an improvement than the 1st animated movie. Wish it would've tied in more to RE:6 seeing how it was released so close together. Either way a must have for fans of the franchise.

I thought I had it stored well enough to keep it safe, however, I did not<br />I was very happy to find this on CD and purchased it.

B000F3T3CS|5.0|This recording of L'Elisir d'Amore was made in 2005 at the Vienna State Opera. This is quite a small theatre and this has an impact on the production which is rather more intimate in feel than is often the case with larger venues.<br /><br />The production is firmly traditional with completely believable costumes and set. The chorus have quite a large vocal and dramatic role in this opera so they need to be actively participative both collectively and individually. This is achieved very well throughout this performance.<br /><br />The two star roles of Adina and Nemorino dominate this opera and feature Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazon at a fairly early stage in their respective careers when both have the freshness of youth on their side. It is quite clear from numerous glances and more obvious interactions that they seem to have a special empathy with each other and this makes a huge difference to the veracity of the performance and to the viewers' enjoyment as the story unfolds on the stage. Both are in fine voice too and the stand-out aria is the touching `Una furtiva lagrima' sung most affectingly by Villazon and which leads to prolonged demands for an encore from the highly enthusiastic audience. They are suitably rewarded and their renewed applause almost stops the show! Netrebko is by no means over-shadowed by this however as her immediately preceding aria `Quanto amore!' is of the same calibre.<br /><br />Leo Nucci as Belcore is clearly no more the young man as described by Adina but he has a twinkle in the eye which cannot be missed and obviously enjoys playing his role opposite the very attractive and nimble Netrebko. This genuine attraction has the effect of encouraging Nucci to shed years and to bring out some of the most vibrant acting I have ever seen from him. His voice is still in very good shape so he makes a good character part. Ildebrando D'Arcangelo as the wily Dulcamara also clearly relishes his role in much the same sort of way as Nucci and he is really very amusing as well as being vocally excellent.<br /><br />Humour and amusement are strong features of this production and much of this stems from the very vibrant interactions between the above mentioned members of the cast and this is quite in addition to the humour built into the script. There are many, seemingly improvised, moments of humour sometimes verging on the slapstick such as Villazon tripping and bumping into things in a bumbling manner, his skilful turn of juggling with 3 apples (he was a circus performer at one time), Netrebko closing his mouth opened in astonishment plus many more small instances of natural good humour.<br /><br />The orchestra under Alfred Eschwe is on good form and the on-stage trumpeter, Konrad Monsberger, is a nice visual touch.<br /><br />The camera work is able to draw the viewer into the action very well and the imaging is crisp with good colour throughout. The sound is good but microphone placing produces moments of reduced volume from the solo singers as they move slightly out of optimum range. The effect is actually more realistic in the crowd scenes for example where the chorus is more powerfully projected compared to the more recessed balance of the soloists. I would not wish to make too much of this as I personally prefer this than the more even, but totally fake effect, of the radio mikes now becoming regrettably more commonplace. The sound is presented in DD 5.0, DTS 5.0 and stereo. The playback level is far lower than normal but can be adjusted via the volume control, in my case by about 4.5 dB.<br /><br />The recent Blu-ray version differs in presentation slightly from the DVD by offering stereo or surround sound but does not give further information as to which type of surround sound. The low level playback is identical to the DVD but the picture is crisper than the DVD as expected. The biggest gain is the added depth to the sound and this is apparent from the start of the overture. The BD version is from the HD source material and is the result of Warner taking over EMI and making BD versions available. Neither the DVD not the BD offer sleeve note information about track listings or the opera plot and could be described as extremely minimalist.<br /><br />This is a most enjoyable production and performance absolutely bubbling with vivacity. The cast interactions on stage seem to be very specially combined and this extra sizzle is very much appreciated by the enthusiastic audience. The whole effect is enhanced by the more intimate nature of the relatively small theatre. I would expect purchasers of this disc to derive great pleasure from it on repeat viewings and therefore it seems reasonable to suggest that this is very much a 5 star product despite the few instances of slightly recessed solo voices.nd making BD versions available.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|As a medical person who has been taken on my own personal journey of discovery I am keenly aware of the arrogance of the medical communiity who &#34;know all things&#34; and will not entertain the ideal of consciousness beyond the brain.  To find one of these very people, albiet  very kind in his interactions with silly ones such as I&#34;  who has now embraced the greater truth is such a delight. The argument that Dr. Alexander puts forth cannot be countered unless one simply chooses to be a disbeliever. There are many who will continue to doubt because they do not have the ability to fathom reality beyond our range of hearing or vision beyond the limited function of our rods and cones.<br />I wish Dr. Alexander could have shared more of the knowledge imparted to him but I suspect this is not the last we shall hear from him...and...as he says, Our language was not constructted to define the greater dimensions<br />.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|If you're interested in an inside account of the mission that killed OBL, read this book. If you're interested in what goes through the minds of America's warrior elite, read this book.<br /><br />Mark Owen's first-hand portrayal of Operation Neptune Spear is both harrowing and impressive. From the months of planning that went into the operation to the swift action of the Operators on the ground that night, Owen provides unparalleled insights into what was (briefly) one of America's most covert operations.<br /><br />Providing as much detail as he can without discussing fellow operators, the classified details of previous missions, or classified Spec Ops tactics, Owen paints a fairly vivid picture of the life of a Navy SEAL Operator fighting in the war on terror. A war with front lines and rules of engagement that frequently blur into gray areas. No Easy Day follows Owen across a number of his deployments as a Navy SEAL to Iraq and Afghanistan (culminating in one 30 minute operation in Pakistan). It's an inside look at the team-first mentality of the SEALs, who attempt to maintain a humble attitude while simultaneously maintaining status as one of the most elite fighting forces in modern military history.
B0091REZMW|4.0|graphics are great works well on my kindle.  have not explored all of the features but so far I like it.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Great part two!  Gideon stole my heart in this book.  Watching these two destroy and hurt their relationship was very painful at times.  Eva's self destructive patterns and need to be the center of attention to the point of destroying Gideon really made me want to slap her.<br /><br />The conclusion really leaves you hanging and now we must wait for book three!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|When I first saw Prometheus in the theaters, I knew that I would be buying the film the day it was released on home entertainment. Sure enough, I did and have been spending the past week or so combing over all the documentaries, photo galleries, deleted scenes, and commentaries provided. I have soaked up every bit of information available and am confident to say that this is probably one of the coolest movies I have seen in a long time. The commentaries, in particular the wirters commentary, were very informative and the deleted sense added even more to insight to the film. I remember thinking when I first saw the film that the engineer was CGI but was delighted to learn from the 7 hour long documentary that they were actually people in suits. You never really see too many films these days that use practical effects and that's such a shame.<br /><br />I was a bit shocked when I saw all the negative feedback from audiences online but later came to the conclusion that this was to be expected. I can only assume that the majority of negative reviews come from people who have only ever seen the movie once. This is NOT the kind of movie you see once and come out of it knowing 90% of the plot (like The Avengers). You have to comb over ever detail, pause at every action shot, and afterwords apply a little brainpower to make sense of it all. There are many subtle pieces of information that one could very easily miss with just the blink of an eye. I honestly don't know what all this nonsense about plot holes is about, but please watch the film yourself and make you own judgements.<br /><br />So overall, the film is now one of my personal favorite and the content in the special features sections is of superb quality. I do however wish that Mr. Scott had left some of those deleted scenes in the final film; they would have made it even cooler. I look forward to seeing the sequel!
B003XU02QG|3.0|Acting wasn't very good... Boring. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Real bloody and loaded with violence. Not very good
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was written in a way that captures the reader's interest and helps you relate to the main character, Charlie.  I love this book. A true coming of age work of art.
B000002AGB|3.0|I bought this 2-CD set back when Sony/Legacy originally released it. And as a huge Who fan, it has mostly sat in my collection unlistened too.  I pulled this out today and popped it in the CD player, and now I know why: while technically the recording suffices, the band's performance is really lacking.  Bum notes , missed timing everywhere, and snide jokes from Pete about who paid to get in and who didn't make it clear why; bottom line is that they just weren't into this 3 a.m. performance and had probably grown tired of playing \\"Tommy\\" again and again. If you were there, maybe all of that can be gotten past with the visual spectacle, but the lone CD listener only has what's been laid down on the recording to go from, and frankly put, anyone considering buying this would be better served buying the \\"Live at Leeds: Deluxe\\" reissue that has the whole of 'Tommy' on it also. In his new memoir, Pete Townshend states that the entire band played as best they could for the Leeds performance, and there's a world of difference in what you hear in that performance. On this 2-disc set, however, it sounds like they are just trudging through the show to get through it - there are a few exceptions like \\"I Don't Even Know Myself\\" but a few good tracks does not make up for the rest of the set.
B0058O84G0|2.0|I was expecting something on the scale of POTE.  I found this book to be significantly more shallow and far less entertaining.
B001P36OXI|4.0|This movie was based on a Georges Dantec \\"Babylon Babies\\". While not a faithful reproduction of Mr. Dantec's novel, it managed to catch the tone and emotional flavor of the book. Vin Diesel did a good job playing Toorop, the central character.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book is definitely interesting with a few twists and turns, however I cannot help but feel as though the author published this with the idea of a future sequel.  As slowly as everything builds, the quick and unsatisfying finish leaves the reader disappointed wondering why the author was in such a rush to conclude the story with such a mundane finale.<br /><br />This was my first read with this author and if this is the style of writing I can expect, I'm not so sure I want to read any other unfinished novels.  I &#34;get&#34; endings that leave you hanging, but this one just leaves you adrift and lost.
B004XISI4A|3.0|A Dance With Dragons I found is much the same as the rest of the Game of Thrones series, with plots running in a dozen different directions, characters making bizarre choices or being killed off just for the sake of it.<br /><br />I can understand the idea behind trying to make it realistic but it is a book and could try to use a bit more imagination and have a few more happy endings instead of killing off good and interesting characters all the time. I keep telling myself surely one of the Stark children remaining will turn up at Winterfell to claim their fathers seat but remain disapointed. Maybe in the next book, one can only hope.

0393088774|5.0|Professors Krugman's ideas do not pass the simple smell test. If giving everyone an extra $830 billion in 2009 wasn't enough to make us think we were all rich and had a recovering economy, his solution then of giving everyone $1.5 trillion would not have worked any better. Why not give everyone $ 5 trillion? Ah, I see we have over four years...and in a $13 trillion economy, no one is fooled that the government is printing almost $ 4 trillion, and borrowing $1 trillion per year. The market knows. Headline unemployment is nominally down because people are losing full time jobs with benefits, and being offered part time jobs without benefits. Some deal. The core premise of Professor Krugman's approach is that the market is too stupid to discount the change in money supply so we can stimulate animal spirits by printing money. But somehow, with the same unit output from four years ago, we now pay double for gasoline? How could that have happened? Could the producers with real goods have raised their prices? How could they adapt so quickly? He clearly played too much peek-a-boo as an infant.

B0078ZTWP4|5.0|I ordered this lantern -- a pair, actually -- soon after having purchased a similar if not 'same as' pair of lanterns from another manufacturer.  These cost less per item, provide better light, and all functions work without struggling to find out how.<br /><br />The top can be removed to reveal the bulb and the lantern hung upside down from inside (e.g.) a tent or small darkened room, such as in a remote cabin with an attached bunkroom.<br /><br />Also, these items are properly sized and enclosed in plastic, features that make them attractive for campers and other sportsmen and families, including the hiker: a lantern can be conveniently packed in a three-day pack without taking up too much room or being uncomfortable: the lantern is light and provides light.<br /><br />Works for me!

First time on an alien planet, they go splunking, see a snake thing, then try to pet it or whatever...ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? OF COURSE IT ATTACKS!  What happened to the aliens again?  Why are they trying to blow up the earth?  What...?  Prelude to Alien my butt.  The end was just lame, there is nothing new here.  Cliche, tired and old, and lame imagination.  I am dumber for having seen it.  Not to mention the tired old rich guy chasing his youth vs. the young idealistic doctor trying to find enlightenment.  I don't like to write negative reviews, but good Lord, I had to vent.

0316228532|4.0|I was very curious to read how Rowling would transition to adult books.  She did it!  This book is definitly not for the faint of heart as these characters are real and raw.  The language is sometimes harsh.  I listened to the audiobook and had a little trouble keeping the multiple plots, each with a cast of dysfuntional characters, straight.  However, I couldn't turn it off as I remained interested in how the story would play out.  The story is a realistic reflection of life in a small English village, and we who live in the US can relate to how local politics become such a big deal to those who are involved.  The teenagers were sympathetic (and horrifying) as they attempt to survive the antics of the adults who govern their lives.  Yes, the ending is sad for one of the characters, but I was hopeful for the future of others in the book.  Rowling provides rich language, vivid descriptions, and a captivating story.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I'm a sci-fi fan and enjoy work in that genre that is well done. The set design was very good and the story was interesting in that it was supposed to be a prequel. Not sure if they hit the mark on that point but I'm sure others might disagree. Fassbender was good, that character really added to the storyline. Hope they do another one, there's a rumor that could happen.

There is some amazing cinematography, some of the most compelling acting and best of all its a movie made smart. I would recommend this movie to anyone with a cultured movie pallet. Watch out for this director, he's bound to make many more!

B001AIRUOU|5.0|This is one of my favorite Halloween/Christmas movies! It has a versatility that is fantastic! You can watch it at Halloween, and then again at Christmas! My whole family enjoys it! The music is awesome as well! I also love the little romance between Jack and his lady fair!
B0098VYKSA|3.0|Very good special effects, good story, seemed to combine parts of several classic fairy tales. (The evil stepmother, the evil forest, etc.  But generally a good, easy to follow storyline, and of course the happy ending. I liked it.
B008220B0C|4.0|My daughter (age 6) is a huge Katie fan, so this was a no-brainer purchase for me. But I was surprised by what a hit it was with her brother(s), and continue to be amused everytime we catch them rockin' out to the movie. Understand that Katie Perry, while fun and catchy, does have some risque lyrics that may catch you off-guard to hear coming out of your child's mouth (and, no, I'm not talking about \\"I kissed a girl\\" which I find tame and funny -- Peacock anyone?). And, as a parent, I support any message where hard work and preserveance makes things possible. KP is generous and gracious in her scenes with fans, thankful for her fame and following, which I also believe is an important message for kids, given all the 'other' pop culture role models out there.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I've read every book he has out so far. Love them all and this one doesn't disappoint. His clever use of mythology gets me everytime. See also the: the secrets of he alchemist Nicholas flamel by Michael Scott. Wicked good
B008JGSM6G|5.0|like 2 star sudoku these puzzles are hard enough to energize my mind without being frustrating. I really enjoy stretching those spacial reasoning cells.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|One of the best books Ive read in a while..can't wait to see what else you bring for us to read
0316228532|2.0|I really looked forward  to reading J.K. Rowlings' first book written for adults. I love the Harry Potter books, which have countless well-shaded interesting three-dimensional characters that adults and children can care about, and colorful riveting storylines. Unfortunately the same can't be said about the Casual Vacancy. Its characters are shallow, grasping, self-interested, manipulative \\"muggles\\" with nothing to care a whit about. The story is so small-minded that by the time I struggled to finish the book, I wondered why I bothered. Such a disappointment.<br /><br />I hope Rowlings writes about people and ideas she cares about next time. I'll sure give her another try.
B008XG1X18|5.0|i love pinterest. so when i saw this app i had to have it.its great; it loads fast. and i never had an interruption.  5 stars all the way.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It reminds me when I was a kid at the fair and playing the old fashioned coin machine.  I love it!
B0058YPG2K|5.0|This is a very simple review. If you liked the last 3 seasons of Breaking Bad then your crazy not to watch this. Bryan Cranston gives a haunting, hypnotic performance as Walter White trying to get out of the trouble he has gotten himself into with meth kingpin Gustavo \\"Gus\\" Fringe. This season trumps the 3 before it and you'd be a fool not to pick this up if you like Breaking Bad at all. This is the best show on television and I would really pay no attention to the idiots who have given this anything less then 5 Stars. Pick it up or you'll miss out on the best acting, writing, cinematography, and direction on television.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really think this is the top of the line bible apps...it is user friendly...with devotionals...and various bible versions which I love because it allows me to get better insight...and interaction with facebook etc. is great
B00984668E|5.0|The Sword comes back with a very awsome and heavy album Apocryphon. Apocryphon is an expansion of a lot of the psychedelic themes they used in songs like Astraea's Dream in their previous album Warp Riders. If you liek The Sword then you should definitely pick this album up. The riffs are great and Cronise has some really good lyrics to go with his vocals in the songs. This album is influenced very much by Black Sabbath riffs and is definitely something to checkout for heavy metal fans. The Deluxe Edition also has some great live recordings of some of my favorite songs, along with a kickass cover of ZZ Top's \\"Cheap Sunglasses.\\" Pick this up if your a fan of the Sword or heavy metal in general.
1616202416|5.0|This was the best book that I have read in a long time. I don't read as much as I used to but I could not put this book down. I bought the 3 books written by this young African woman and it blew my mind. I need to find out what else she has written. The 3 books she has written are phenomenal. I want more. I did not want the books to end. And the soft covers were perfect. Story excellent, I see why she has won so many accolades in her young career. I am inspired, I want to write. She is from my generation, we share Africa as our origin and I am truly honored that she wrote these three wonderful books. (The thing around your neck, Half of a yellow sun and Purple Hibiscus).
B006CNR0BG|5.0|Fantastic and unique band, amazing album (a personal favourite that gets better and better with time) and what a difference listening to it in this new 4.1 mixes.<br />The music is so high quality (in terms of conception, arrangements and execution) that even my kids ask me to listen to this album, along with Deep Purple's Machine Head, proving that good music is ageless.<br /><br />If you want a solid and detailed review, please check this one:<br />http://www.amazon.co.uk/review/RMTREKBFEFQYB/ref=cm_cr_rev_detup_redir?_encoding=UTF8&asin=B006CNR0BG&cdForum=Fx2RFSDEUKN9J0O&cdPage=1&cdThread=Tx3E15H3HDGE16Y&newContentID=Mx16EACMHNQFK3Y&newContentNum=4&store=music#Mx36VZ36389XDNX
1568363931|5.0|Makiko Itoh's book is my go to book for lunch planning these days.  As well as having delicious recipes, her guidelines on bento planning and packing make this book an invaluable and unmatched resource for all bento makers and particularly valuable for those who, like me, are new to this fascinating form of the packed lunch.
B009CPES4I|3.0|After all the characters are introduced you know basically what is going to happen.<br />But it is not terrible. Well done, nice story of life type movie.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|it is just like streaker run, temple run, and dash it. They all have the same consept. Out of all i would say dash it would be my favorite.
B0057B8PT0|5.0|So, I live in the U.S. and I just couldn't wait for Olly's CD to come out here in December. So, I purchased it, and it is worth it! His music puts a smile on my face and I can't stop listening to it!
B009YDAUJ0|1.0|I am very disappointed with this season. It is not very exciting to watch. It started slow in the first episode and 2nd. I was hoping the 3rd would flare up a bit. Unfortunately, it did not. This use to be my favorite show. I will continue to purchase, but hope it gets more exciting soon.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|Great for teens! Parents should not give their teens an iPhone without buying this case! Also the variety of colors makes it fashionable.
B004ZG5F28|4.0|clean bluray so easy on the eyes. good performance and accent from ReneeZ as Bridget Jones (method acting as gained I think 40 pounds for the role).  movie really takes off when HughG and ColinF fight over Bridget Jones.  Laughs aplenty in this comedy, but viewers should note that lot of foul language, too.  Still for me easily in the top ten of my favorite romantic comedies. The followup Edge of Reason is not quite as funny, but still worthwhile for fans of this one.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|This is a really good movie if you like the spy stuff.  It is not full<br />of amazing, non-existent gadgets like a lot of these movies seem to have<br />migrated to.  The acting is good, it has a good plot and the extras include<br />a couple of alternative endings.  I added it to my collection of DVD's<br />that I can watch over and over again.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|When the cussing starts on the first page, in the first sentence, and it makes sense for it to be there, you know you are in for an interesting tale.  One of the funniest best written books I have read from the .99 Amazon collection.  I read a lot of these looking for gems and this one is a diamond.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Strange movie but thought provoking.  Not for the weak stomach person.<br />It has some similarities to the Alien story line in it.  Great special<br />effects.  The tall alien dude is awesome.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I liked this book and found the description of the mission in Abbottabad to be really cool.  I could have done without the lengthy description of how the author got to DEVGRU.  The biggest problem for me is that I still think this 1st hand account leaves several questions unanswered about when the Pakistani military figured out that something was up and what their response was.  Those details could have gone a long way to establishing their complicity in harboring Bin Laden.<br /><br />All of that being said I greatly respect how these guys go about their business and I'm always psyched to know that they are on our side.<br /><br />The book is a good fun read.
B004EPYZUS|1.0|This movie has more hokey unbelievable gadget stuff in it than<br />a James Bond film.  He has gloves that let him stick to the outside<br />glass of a skyscraper and crawl up it like Spiderman.  One of the other<br />people has a magnetic shirt that lets him fall 25 feet and get<br />\\"magnetically levitated\\" just above a rolling cart.  There is<br />a sonic gadget of some kind that can pulverize a perfectly round<br />hole through a concrete floor.  This should put an end to the MI<br />sequels because it is just not even close to believable.  If they<br />had left all the impossible mission gadgets out it might have been<br />a decent movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I simply love it.  Visually, it is not too busy looking; it is just right, effective simplicity!  I have had other calculators, and I like this one the best.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Nice app. Easy to use, no bugs that I've seen. I would definitely recommend. I don't like having to write a dissertation for an app review.
B0087HT36U|4.0|its a fun way and a good way to kill time while traveling. finished the game in 2 days and no updates in a month or so. can complain to much though seeing how it was a free game.!!!!!
B004WR125O|5.0|This adapter was easy to install and has not cut out (lost its signal)once in the several weeks that I have been using it.
160094048X|5.0|Great book. If you are a tru vegan, a book like this is extremely helpful if you have a sweet tooth.
B00136JS12|5.0|what else do you have to say?? It's a classic rock album that will always stand the test of time.
1592332803|5.0|Already used it and the chocolate chip cookies were wonderful.. Going to try pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving and maybe pumpkin bread.
B005YHEFJ6|2.0|When you adjust the mic down a certain point it makes a loud static noise in the speaker also when you have nothing playing all you can hear static and i had new ones from best buy before and that isn't normal. so after i found out that when you put the mic down a certain point it made loud static i open the speaker and all the wires were cut and taped with black electrical tape not how my old pair came from best buy
B000FC0SIM|5.0|This was a somewhat surprise, not because the autobiographical elements but because King was very good on giving hints of writing for would-be  writers. The whole book was written in readable style and advices for the writing process were all presented in a nice pedagocical style. I learned not to use passive voice and omit adverbs -- in itself not very original but he does it so well.
B0009FTXGI|1.0|Used this on my Canon 17-40mm lens and this hood would not latch on. It kept dropping off while walking.<br />I tried latching the hood a number of times but it didnt work..
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved it! Read it in two days almost non stop. Can't wait for the last book to be released in December.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Wonderful app. This version has a large number of plans that allow you read and experience the Bible at your own pace.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. The storyline was very interesting and the game itself was challenging. I definitely would recommend this game to anyone. It was well worth twice what I paid.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|As a Kentuckian living in Lexington at the time Secretariat won the triple crown, the year I graduated from High School, I couldn't have been more happy to have this story told in a movie.  The roles were well played and I especially liked how the story of Penny and husband reflected how women were growing in businesses.  Her husbands initial comments and jealousy in the beginning of the film reflected how it was in the late 60s, early 70s.  My how things have changed.  In today's politically correct world though, I can't help but wonder if Secretariat would have been disqualified simply because his heart was bigger than most.  It's amazing the horse racing community hasn't shouted foul and given the win to the second place horse instead.  Sad how things have changed!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|No one can seam together history with fictional characters better than Ken Follett.  His stories are involved and creative. Each families history intertwines with the other throughout great moments in world history. There is no story teller any better than Mr. Follett. Whenever I finish one of his epic works I feel as though a part of my family has gone into hibernation. I'm left missing his characters and wanting the story to continue right away. An absolutely GREAT read!
B007MDB6L0|5.0|A really nice production with high quality visuals and \\"right-pricing\\" from Disney for all children (irrespective of age) who enjoy the Tinkerbell series.
B001IF252M|5.0|Great product. Well packaged. Using regularly without hiccups. I have had cheaper versions of these, this is the best. Not much more to say.
B009IJJ712|5.0|I was hesitant to try this show as I do with most shows these days as most are crappy mainstream-sucking shows.  But my wife recorded the pilot episode and thought we should watch it the next night.  So, I figured, \\"what the hell, nothing else better to do.\\"  The first scene immediately caught my interest.  You have to have a love/hate relationship with Holmes to truly appreciate his character.  He is a major narcissistic pompous jackass, but he is among the most brilliant, genius and most intelligent detectives I have ever had the pleasure of watching.  I can see this becoming one our religiously viewed weekly shows.  The others being \\"Ghost Adventures\\" \\"NCIS\\" \\"NCIS: LA\\" \\"The Mentalist\\" \\"CSI\\" and \\"Criminal Minds.\\"
