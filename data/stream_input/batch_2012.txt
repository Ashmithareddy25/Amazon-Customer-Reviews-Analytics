B006LSZECO|2.0|I always read reviews.  But this time I went on a recommendation and didn't so much as glance at what people had said about this book.  It was a definite page turner and very captivating.  Unfortunately the end was absolutely awful!  I kept thinking, \\"That can't be it.  Maybe I missed something.  Maybe there's an epilogue to tie everything together and finish the story.\\"  But no - there was not.  I was left feeling unsatisfied and unsettled.  It's a shame really because the book showed promise throughout.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I heard  a lot of buzz about this book and finally decided to read it for myself and I must say it did not disappoint! Can't wait to read the sequel next!

1451648537|4.0|This book was extremely well-written, easy to get through and very interesting.  I definitely got a good sense of the man, a credit to his openness with the author and the author's ability to translate the story into the written word.  The only criticism I have is that it could have been edited down soem more.  For example, I get the fact that Jobs cried a lot but didn't need to read the same description about it every time.

B006VFLIYK|1.0|I LOVED BALDACCI'S EARLIER WORK BUT COULDN'T FINISH THIS BOOK.  WRITING WAS POOR, STORY NOT GOOD AND VERY TEDIOUS.  HE STARTED TO FALL OFF AFTER THE SECOND CAMEL CLUB BOOK AND BEEN DOWNHILL FROM THEN ON.

B000XUBC5E|5.0|Harlan Coben is of two minds: thrillers and Myron Bolitar series.  The former I like quite a bit: I find him to be an excellent writer.  However, the Bolitar series I find to be akin to a parody of these types of  buddy books.  The writing is full of wisecracks that aren't funny and stereotypes that are boring.  It's like the difference between an Audi A8 and an A4 - upper end and lower end writing. However, he is clearly doing something right since the Bolitar series has done quite well.

B007SGLZP8|3.0|This was a better effort than other recent books by Grisham but still not up to his early career standards.  The story was good but very predictable and the book could have been 50 pages shorter since there was so much repetition and filler.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This is, hands down, a great addition to anyone's movie collection. Anyone who buys this movie will be pleased to watch it over and over again. The story line is great and the people who play the characters seem to fit very well.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is huge which makes typing easy and no accidental mistyping.  Free is even better.  Everything a basic calculator needs to be.
B002RI9ZQ8|4.0|I felt that the way the book was written by Stieg Larsoon took the reader a few chapters before they could understand the different characters and each of their backgrounds before you could start to engage with story and start to visualise each of them as you read each chapter in the book.
B0083GQKQG|5.0|This movie came alive (unfortunately) with the Sandy Hook Massacre! Thrilling! Shocking! It is also an excellent movie to show to the world if you have a problem with your kid, never ignore!!!!
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|I was disappointed with this book.  It didn't hold my interest and found that it was disturbingly violent at a time when there is too much violence in this country.  I can't recommend it for anyone that doesn't have a perverted sense of life.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A really amazing story, I enjoyed reading the view of World War 2 seen through the eyes of a German fighter pilot. It was an eye opener for me in many ways.
014241722X|2.0|*Some series spoilers*<br /><br />This was the first Grisham novel I've ever read, but I'd heard of his reputation. I was hoping this book/series would be good present for my law-minded seventh grade brother. While I wouldn't say it was terrible, I felt that an Encyclopedia Brown style might have worked better over all. After reading the next two books I'm even more convinced of it.<br /><br />First some quick positive points, though.<br />1. Theo is a likeable character. While he tries to be an adult, it's easy to see that at the end of the day he's just a thirteen-year-old, subject to all the fears and insecurities that come with that territory.<br />2. I particularly like the relationship between the Boone parents; too many young adult heroes have horrible family lives and it was nice to see a positive family model for once.<br /><br />That said, the story takes a long time to develop with a lot of irrelevant side point (read: Kitty Court). Actually, I was more entertained by the side points than the rest of the story. Which is probably why I'm thinking an Encyclopedia Brown structure would be better for this character.<br /><br />There are also holes between the books. For example:<br />- In this book April's parents are getting divorced; in the second they aren't, no mention of the divorce or absence thereof is made.<br /><br />-The first book ends with the Duffy trial being called a mistrial, \\"to be continued\\" so to speak. The second book makes absolutely no mention of this trial, or what Theo accomplished previously until the very last page! (You would think bringing a murderer close to possible justice recently would be an important piece of information to mention when recapping a character). I thought that maybe I'd been reading the novels out of order, but no. The third book does the opposite: it makes a big to-do about the trial at the start of the novel and then abruptly the trial disappears from the plot, not to be mentioned again. I mean, the defendant's hired thug had been tailing Theo in chapter 2, in the next his property is being vandalized and I was sure it was all working up to something huge to do with the court case. Uh-uh. After a quick mention of Pete Duffy in chapter 6 the man and his trial have disapeared completely from the book. What's going on? Is this going to be a running gag to sort of connect the books?<br /><br />There are a few other inconsistancies that had me bugged. Knowing my brother, he'll pick up on them. As Grisham helpfully points out, kids notice quite a lot.<br /><br />On its own, I wouldn't say that this first one was a disapointment. I kind of wish it was a thicker stand alone that tied all the parts together.  However, that said, I'll be looking for a different book for my brother.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|The story starts out a little cliche, but then takes a turn.  For very practical reasons Conner wants to stay married.  The story then gets interesting with good character development.  I could understand why each felt the way they did.  A good and entertaining read.  I couldn't put it down.
B0054VVRBQ|5.0|got it for my 2011 late mbp so that i have a sd card port. was worried it wouldnt fit flush but it does, even with the card inside. fits in perfectly, and comes out without getting stuck. the sd card reader is a bit of a pain to install as it requires the download of the drivers, and then requires changing permission/security settings to allow for unrecognised software, but after all of that, and a restart, the reader recognized my card with no issues. would recommend it for the quality as well as the fact that it works on sdxc cards (cards bigger than 32gb).
B009ZQJVAK|5.0|Most entertaining story and acting. The music is wonderful. Overall it is a very successful film.I give it a five stars.

B0090SI4HO|3.0|I remember weeks ago seeing back-to-back trailers for this film and Sylvester Stallone's \\"Bullet to the Head.\\"  Sly's film looked ridiculous and stupid, not to mention he is after thugs that took his daughter.  How original.  But then Arnold's movie trailer comes on and it seems pretty clear we are going to get good guys and bad guys in an unlikely shoot-out, but damn if it doesn't look like fun.  And damn if it isn't.<br /><br />Schwarzenegger plays Sheriff Ray Owens, a small town cop on the Arizona-Mexico border.  Coming his way from Las Vegas is an escaped cartel boss (Eduardo Noriega) in a souped-up Corvette ZR-1.  In a ridiculous and convoluted scenario, this occurs during a transfer supervised by FBI agent John Bannister played by Forest Whitaker in a performance about as lame as his character's  management of the transfer.  Maybe Whitaker just couldn't understand director Jee-woon Kim's instructions.<br /><br />The fun really starts when Cortez (Noriega) approaches the border town.  You see Cortez is also a professional race car driver.  Think about it.  In an earlier set up, Cortez has sent a cadre of henchmen ahead to prepare a portable bridge over a ravine into Mexico.  Since everyone is out of town at a football game, the sheriff will have to defend their border with an out-of-shape deputy (Luis Guzman), another pair of deputies new to the job (Zach Gilford and Jaimie Alexander), the town drunk/ Iraq War veteran (Rodrigo Santoro) and town gadfly (Johnny Knoxville).<br /><br />Arnold is at his self-deprecating best as the tired veteran of the L. A. police force just looking for a little quiet time.  The film is exactly what it promises, nothing more.  It's fun.

B0067EKY9K|4.0|A rich beyond belief sheik (Amr Waked) who is fond of fishing is determined to introduce salmon to his country.  While this sounds preposterous on its surface, there is a section of the country that is mountainous and has a healthy river.  The sheik hires a British consulting firm to explore the possibilities.  In charge of the assignment, Harriet (Emily Blunt) arranges a meeting between the sheik and a fishing expert played by Ewan McGregor.  Pushing things along is Patricia Maxwell (Kristin Scott Thomas), the Prime Minister's publicist.<br /><br />Director Lasse Hallstrom's film is an unassuming attempt at a romantic comedy, but there is little romance and not much comedy.  I'm not being overly critical as the film evolves into a complicated light drama.  We pretty much know up front that the two charming and attractive stars will eventually get romantically entangled, but both appear to be in solid relationships.  Dr. Alfred Jones (McGregor) is married to a woman (Catherine Steadman) with her own career and who travels regularly.  Harriet is in a relatively new relationship with a British soldier (Tom Mison) with a new assignment in Afghanistan.<br /><br />The heart of the movie is the slow appreciation for each other as working partners.  Harriet and Alfred after a contentious beginning find common ground with each other and the project.  Sheik Muhammed is the wise catalyst.  McGregor and Blunt have wonderful chemistry and we certainly want to see them together.  But this is a chaste relationship and their current partners are not unlikeable.  A difficult acting assignment no matter how well the story is written.<br /><br />While I enjoyed this film very much, a couple subplots emerge that are unnecessary.  We are in the Middle East, so I guess that means a potential for terrorist activity.  While brief, this injection just didn't feel right with this film and doesn't help the already dilatory pacing.<br /><br />The Blu ray transfer is excellent.  Shot on film, it looks wonderful in 1080p resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ration.  Colors are wonderful, the look is crisp and sharp.  The beautiful photography comes across with no issues that I could see.  The audio, likewise is crystal clear using the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option.  Sounds of the river music and a thunderous helocopter are well disbursed.  The extras are minimal with two film-specific supplements and the usual array of Sony previews.it looks wonderful in 1080p resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ration.

B006LSZECO|5.0|The shifting tone in the novel is fascinating.  The two protagonists seem quite likable at first and very slowly reveal themselves to be completely different.  This reader ended up disgusted with both characters, but that's what the author obviously intended.  Anyone who has ever had a cheating spouse will appreciate the fiendishly clever revenge Amazing Amy creates for her unwitting husband, but she's a chillingly coldhearted creation.

B00AHTYI5M|4.0|The well rounded script adresses many corrosive details that permeate the whole event. The circumstance that surrounds the fact there's a film inside the film, the acidic around the movie's industry, the inner tribulations of the people to be rescued, the fatalism that underlies bellow the life of Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) as well as Lester Siegel (The great Alan Arkin)and the fabulous edition in which ties the fiction of the supposed script with the real events in plain development make of this film, probably the thriller of the year.<br /><br />Ben Affleck shows a real improvement in the third vintage as director. Tense moments of crucial stress between the rules from the high Official spheres facing the deal of being in the very ground of the facts, which leads to that very risky  decision at the right moment.<br /><br />To my mind, the film should earn the Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor. The fact of having won the Golden Globe as Best Dramatic Movie increases the odds.<br /><br />Don't miss it!!!

0765325950|3.0|I enjoyed this book but sadly felt let down overall - it was like giving into a chocolate craving, reaching for the first chocolate that I could lay my hands on. Following that instant gratification however, I wished that I had stayed my hand and gone for something richer and more satisfying, even if it meant going without for longer.<br /><br />That's the best way I can describe how I feel about A Memory of Light. Cliche I know!<br /><br />On one hand I appreciate Brandon Sanderson's efforts, but at the same time I'm wondering whether he rushed through it so he could get back to his own projects? I feel that the ending deserved more and he did us a disservice (harsh but I'm sure there were other authors who would have been more reverent). If not and this is simply his writing style, then fair enough, it's just a matter of taste.<br /><br />Regarding the actual story, I thought the numerous battle scenes gave a good impression of the chaos, but there were too many to the detriment of the main characters and ending. Rather than removing scenes however, I would have loved for this last book to have been split into two, with more scenes involving the major characters. This book was spread far too thinly where they were concerned which is where, in my opinion, the book's failings lie.<br /><br />Lastly, I'm disappointed that the e-book hasn't been released yet. I bought the audio book instead but thought Harriet's move was downright disrespectful. Imposing her opinion on others - hmmm, sounds like a few well known characters in her husband's books. I didn't dock any stars from my rating however, despite being annoyed by this.

Just wrong.<br /><br />Since it didn't work as it should, and the app store description doesn't even mention the DLNA or Allshare, I have no idea what is wrong or what it really takes to make it work.  How about a list of tested TVs?  Also I will not support a app that forces itself into my Facebook account.  There is no reason for that, other then having me pay for the app AND advertise for them.<br /><br />...  edit<br /><br />I have since found out the web site description is much better.  I think most use the app store description.  Someone said that not logging into Facebook only limits the Facebook videos.  My TV wasn't seen by the app but my TV can see the internet.  So the app didn't work for me.  Even if you can skip Facebook, I don't like being asked everytime for me to login.  Btw, I did see from the beginning that you can skip Facebook login.  It just didn't work right, so I assumed it was because I didn't login.  Which is true for most programs and I had no evidence otherwise.
B00005JLZN|5.0|This was a gift for my wife, and just to see her face light up when she opened it was delight enough for me to love it,
B003YV0A02|5.0|As ever Die Hard is freaking awesome!! And the HD transfer looks amazing! As someone who grew up watching this on VHS I have to say the clarity just makes this movie THAT MUCH BETTER.
B00003CXFV|5.0|this movie is a wonderful movie, and shows the corruption of todays society in a way that no other movie really does, Julia Roberts does a wonderful job in this movie
B008XG1X18|5.0|Although I should probably be doing something fun like housework or grocery shopping...pinterest takes me away from all that. I love it!
B007SUW24W|5.0|This was a gift for my wife, and just to see her face light up when she opened it was delight enough for me to love it, then i got to hear the album and loved almost every song on it
1595828753|5.0|My son loves Avatar and really enjoys reading these comic book style books.  Just wish they were a little cheaper though.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love this game. It is so addictive. Once you get started and finally, win one, or just advance to the next level, it is hard to stop!
B005LAIISU|5.0|Ice Age keeps getting it right.  Even though my children are getting older, they still love all of the Ice Age movies.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Really really really really good, I like British Tv so this was really really really good. Only 3 more words lol..
0553801473|5.0|If you enjoy Game of Thrones, this is a good continuation.  You just get really interested and the book is done...making you wait for the next edition to come out.
B0058YPILY|5.0|Criminal Minds fan!  Can't wait until season 8 is available!  Great staff and wonderful team, don't want to see them ever to split up.
B007MDB548|5.0|Disney does it again.  My daughter loved this movie and my 9-year old son even enjoyed it, although he will deny it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fantastic game! The graphics are great and everything you can do with the horse is very realistic and super fun to play! Originally, I got this game for my four year old daughter to play, but I find myself playing it as much, if not more, than she does!
B005URRCUY|5.0|Ordered this CD for my boyfriend, and we enjoyed every song on this album. The music is great, and I love the style. Highly recommended.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|If you believe in magic and fairy tales, then you would like to be in Gaiman's land of Faerie as much as I do, same as I believe that Pratchett's Discworld is there somewhere...
B004JN1D2I|5.0|After seeing the show on HBO, my boyfriend and I bought these books and read them together.  They're very hard to put down.  We love the series. The characters have depth--everyone has shades of grey, which makes the characters believable, even in fantastic situations. I'd recommend the series to anyone who loves fantasy, drama, or simply a great read. Don't be intimidated by the thickness--these books fly.
0062202081|5.0|Muy buena calidad de papel. Hermosas fotografías. Tiene un resumen preciso y justo de sus giras. Libro indispensable para sus fans
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|Pretty silly dialogue and not really all that original. Felt a bit gimmicky and not what one would hope from Stone.
0345803485|3.0|Its a good novel but its language its like fot teenagers no adults content I waS desperate to read it got the 3 from amazon but I'm still in num one and when I read a little I prefer go see tv. I think sex and the City had the language this novel should have. I'm so mad with myself for buying the trilogy.
B004V6BQ3O|5.0|I've used it a couple of times.  Great to attach to a 10-ft cable to camera for long distance micing.
B00A2BTCTC|2.0|The music on this set was as always great. However, I purchased this set for my husband Christmas and we were both very disappointed in the blue-musicray comic strip. We were expecting to see a music video of the band in concert. Very disappointing!
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|Terrible movie..way too much swearing...moved too slow, boring, poor acting..wished I'd waited to check it out free from the library.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|You can create any kind of sound to fit your taste! Feel like listening to a campfire tonight? Would you like a sound of crickets with that or maybe you would like to hear our special, ocean delight?!
B008602KQI|5.0|Very heart wrenching premise that keeps your attention throughout movie. HD digital copy very clear with excellent sound. 5 stars for the movie overall and especially for the cast- accomplished believable characters from the seasoned pros and young actors.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is one of the best books I read. I liked it because it was kind of funny and a good book.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I loved the authors use of different points of view!  Dark, creepy, chilling!  I couldn't put it down.  Highly recommended.
B008476HBM|5.0|I have always wanted to read Pride and Prejudice, so you can imagine my joy when I found it for FREE on my Kindle.<br /><br />P&P was exactly what I thought it would be, one of the greatest books Jane Austen has ever written.<br /><br />I immediately fell in love with Elizabeth's character, and just as immediately began to hate the characters of Lydia and Mrs. Bennett, Jane Austen wrote them so realistically that the three of them reminded me of people I knew in real life. You know an author  is amazing at what they do when they can actually make you feel some sort of emotion with their characters, especially when the character is meant to be loved or hated.<br /><br />Well, that's all
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was definitely an addicting read. I couldn't put the book down until I was finished. You can definitely learn something about yourself, and be proud of life's downs.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|So what we have here is a series of books about a woman who wants a boyfriend who beats on her and treates her like crap? Do I have that right? I got through about 75 pages before my stomach was churning with sickness. Why are all the woman of the world falling for this crap? IS this what you really want? Get some freaking self esteme. Get a brain. ANybody who likes this crap is an IDIOT!!!
B009A9BEHU|5.0|CD arrived very fast and packaged well in terms of protecting the product during transit. I would recommend using this person/company.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Refreshing new twist on a classic. The characters are perfectly flawed. Sherlock's mystery solving abilities are often unbelievable which makes him classic Holmes. It's not just another TV crime drama, thank you. Watson is a cleverly written update and Lucy is terriffic.  Johnny Lee Miller has a new big fan. One of the few nights a week I actually make a point of watching TV.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|I would definitely buy again from this person/company. The product arrived on time and was well protected in transit. The quality is just like it should be and it plays as if it were brand new.
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|Watch this video,  perhaps twice.<br />It presents critically important information..<br /><br />A friend loaded me a copy to watch.<br />I have purchased some copies that I will start sharing.  If a friend wants to watch, the friend will be  asked to pass it on to a friend.  Before the &#34;travel starts&#34;, a &#34;pass it along&#34; label will be added to the case.
0765325950|5.0|This book is a fitting conclusion to the most epic fantasy series of all time. What a blessing it is that Robert Jordan knowingly spent the final days of his life putting together notes and writing scenes to ensure this series had an end, even if his own end was to come first.<br /><br />What a blessing it is that Robert Jordan's wife and editor, Harriet, selected Brandon Sanderson to complete this series, and a blessing again that Brandon accepted that responsibility. Brandon did what few, if any, other authors would do in spending four years of his own life trying to complete another man's series the right way. I can't imagine how difficult this task must have been.<br /><br />What a blessing for e-reader users that Brandon convinced the late Robert Jordan's wife to shorten the delay of the ebook release, though he wasn't able to get it eliminated completely.<br /><br />How pathetic to downgrade the rating of this great work to a single star because of the delay in the ebook release. This is a book that we had no right to expect or even believe possible when its author began to die, and yet it is here, and it is worth the wait.<br /><br />&#34;Let the Dragon ride again on the winds of time&#34;
0307592731|5.0|I'd read so much about \\"Wild\\" that I was prepared to be a little disappointed. . .as with a movie everyone loves so much - and it's just ok when you finally see it.<br /><br />Well, \\"Wild\\" did not disappoint.  I was suprised at how I was drawn in and wanted to follow Cheryl through her hike.  I've never been much of an outdoors person and imagine I wouldn't think of hiking the PCT as a way to deal with grief and loss. . .but Cheryl's story turned me around. She writes so honestly and clearly about her grief at the loss of her Mother - this really resonated with me.  I like how she says she finally has her mother \\"inside her\\".  That's how I've come to grips w/ losing my own mother.<br /><br />Strayed's description of the challenges she faces every single day are just so compelling and actually hard for me, sitting in comfort in my home, to even imagine.  The natural challenges - and her constant issue of being out of cash - are overwhelming. I found it truly powerful to read about how Strayed dealt with continual pain. . .I've never done/nor ever will do - anything like her hike. . .but walking in a marathon, I stopped when blisters and foot pain became unbearable. . .so I am just very much in awe of her achievement.  (I want to know if her feet have ever been OK again!)<br /><br />I also found this book - which I read for my book club - to be a great one to use as a takeoff point for discussions. . .she had so many decisions to face, issues to deal w/ that I think we can have a terrific and wide-ranging discussion.<br /><br />What a great read.
B0015DROBO|3.0|I almost stopped reading.....the first 1/4 of the book was slow and boring. I urged myself to keep on because I had heard that it was a good read. I'm glad I finished it, it was entertaining later on.
B000FA5STS|5.0|Even though this is one of his older books it was very good.  I have loved every Baldacci book I have ever read.  I did not have the end figured out before the end of the book
B007MU85D0|5.0|This is a great album by a really great band. The first song I heard by them was Little Talks and from then on, I fell in love with this band. I don't usually buy albums but I had to buy theirs just because I love them so much. If you are into great music, then you should definitely buy this album. You won't regret it.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|A much improved second album in choice of cuts as well as technical quality.The album is a current favorite of mine.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I have read four of Lee Child's books, seen the movie, have a little chuckle trying to picture Tom Cruise as 6'5&#34;... I was an MP, 6'4&#34;, retired Police Lieutenant also.  I think I picture me in his place, after all I am not known as &#34;The CLub&#34; for nothing... truth is I usually wound up using my bare hands in fights... no time to grab a baton... So anyway, I am a big fan, loved the movie, waiting for more, and getting ready for more &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; books.... as I am 73 now, I have to let my mind do the fighting!  Want to read my autobiography anyyone??
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is tons of fun! They have done a great job with the physics of the horse's movements. I really like this app.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|This game is totally radical, dude! Each level has different challenges but there is no guessing random combinations or far-fetched relationships. The levels are more complicated than 100doors but it's the same idea.Great game!
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|This is one of those books that qualifies as a car accident. There's unbearable traffic until you get near, and you start wondering how bad it was, was anyone injured, and surely it must be terrible for this kind of backup! And then you get to the scene and it's nothing at all and you can't believe you wasted all that time for nothing.<br /><br />I'm an avid reader and I nearly always give everything I read a fair chance, but this book never redeemed itself. It seems to have been written by a 15 year old dreaming about the really awesome college experience. The amount of pure fantasy within these pages is ridiculous. I enjoy a good romance, I enjoy good fiction, and I enjoy suspense, but no part of the plot made up for the sheer unbelievability of their lives. Since when does a good college contain a \\"cafeteria\\" where random kids sit on long rows of tables next to the rowdy \\"football players\\" and since is it a given that every 18 year old has a quality fake ID? On what campus do students repeatedly have underground fight clubs? In what college setting do all the kids go to the same classes?<br /><br />Oh wait! That's right, this is much more like my high school.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game will keep you occupied for hours. It is a great find for horse lovers and it is fun to progress and buy new items for your horse.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Definitely my favorite March three style game. I`ve bought and played one, two, and three and have played through all three more then once. Definitely a good purchase if you enjoy games like Bejeweled and enjoy earning powerups etc to add a bit more challenge to the game....
B00A8SPNYW|3.0|There needs to be a tutorial for new elements in the game, and explanations of how things like doors and cats work. And if a user is trying draw a path around a wall, and there's a way to do it, don't make the mouse get stuck on the wall.
B008XBCJ34|3.0|I understand that it is a piece of plastic but a DVD, at this price, should be processed without flaws. I saw it at the movies and wanted a copy when they finally came out. Went past 3/4 of the DVD, when it started to act up. It stopped and jumped 4 times. Maybe this is the only bad copy.<br />Good luck to others.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|It has been several years yet we are still feeling the results of this debacle . This the first of several books that have come out on the subject. I wish I  had been a  big enough player to have participated but as usual the little guys just try to make a survival living in quiet desperation.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Great app i love to play it lots of fun. Good for anybody always have great updates available. Get it
B003O86FMW|5.0|very riveting.  entertaining.  filled with suspense and a yearning for a satisfying ending.  auto fill is extremely irritating.  good fast paced read.  I will never do another review n.a.
B009ZE27US|1.0|Horrible app! It only comes up that you you are 53 or 65. I would not get this app EVER again.
B003VIWO9I|3.0|It seems a little stiff, characters are good but not special.  Could use  more background on each character. Would like more information on the land and where it took place.
0525478817|5.0|Wow. Just wow.<br /><br />Here's a book that I was just too damn cheap to buy full price, even though the cover blurb grabbed me when I first came across it. So, I waited my turn at the library, and finally got lucky when the audio version was added to the collection (still haven't gotten my call for the hard copy.) This was no problem for me, as I enjoy audio versions, both when driving or for listening to when I'm doing tasks around the house. For this book, though, I invented tasks as an excuse to listen. When those ran out, I just sat like a lump and followed Hazel and Gus through their days.<br /><br />This is a book that reaches out and grabs your heart from the get-go. Green has created powerful characters, brought us into their everyday world, and made it vibrant, heart-wrenching, and beautiful. This is not always an easy task, for there's very little about cancer that is beautiful. But there is a great deal that is glorious in the two young people in this story. Synopses abound. Go read one if you wish, but it cannot adequately prepare for how engaging this story is.<br /><br />A bonus to the audio version is that there is an interview with Green. I really appreciated his insights on the story, writing, life with cancer, and more. I also found out that he has done an audio version of the book, primarily for the fans of his vlog, who wanted to hear his inflections to the story. The audio version I listened to was superb, and as Green said, he was much happier to hear Hazel say, \\"you're so hot\\" in a female voice than in his lovely baritone.<br /><br />Oddly enough, while reading this, I also read of Neil Gaiman's participation in  An Evening of Awesome at Carnegie Hall (available on youtube) presented last week by Hank and John Green.Watch the video, and you'll get to hear the stars of The Lizzie Bennet Diaries (which also involves Hank Green) read the wonderful section in the museum (won't say more because of spoilers.)<br /><br />10 out of 5 stars. Yes, I liked it.iked it.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Graphics are great and keeps you interested..but I got to a certain point in the game and shutdown for charging..when I restarted it deleted my saved game!  It wouldn't start again..would try loading then it close out.  I had to uninstall it.  Not good!
B004J4WNL2|3.0|I bought this because I really, really liked the TED talk [...]. But this book is a re-hash of that exact TED talk with various stories  or interviews associated. Don't get me wrong -- it's not a bad book, but it's not a good one either.<br /><br />I was expecting for a psychology orientated book and while this has bit of psychology, it's kept anecdote orientated. Some will like this but it's not for me. I like the clinical \\"science\\" side of psychology and that lack is what made the book disappointing for me.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was just as good as the first. Never wanted to put it down and I'm not a person that reads many books. A definite 5 star.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|One of Salvatore's masterpieces. The birth and young life of Drizzt the young drow. Epic and fluid battles... what else can you ask for?
1452101248|5.0|What a great cook book, different unusual food combinations.  Really enjoyed everything that I have looked.  I would love to buy the Ottolenghi book next.
B008476HBM|5.0|Great book I read it in a week loved this classic book Lizzy and Darcy is a true love story
B007L24T52|4.0|From the first word the story gets of on a gallop and does not stop until the end. Fast pace and full of action. It lost the one star because it sometimes felt just to good to be true but on the other hand, that is what fictional heroes do. A very enjoyable read that I definitely  will recommend.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book keeps you going. Just when you think you got it figured out it takes a turn and you are sucked further into it. Holder is amazing and Sky is so strong.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|Worth purchasing; nice music that carries on that bad boy southern sound.  I was done but I needed more words to be able to post; you won't be sorry or have buyers remorse
B00A8ECU24|2.0|I really like the game however, finding people to add is next to impossible. Gems are too hard to get and way too much money to buy. Also, I can't visit any of the people I did manage to add because the game force closes whenever I try. Please fix the bugs and make things a little cheaper to get.
B00846REIS|5.0|The next fifty shades of grey....excellent storyline! Definitely recommend this book to all my family and friends who want a good book....
0321344758|4.0|As developers make stuff more and more  idiot proof, nature keeps coming up with bigger and better idiots...This one is a big step for the good guys.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like how this app has so many different games for you to play and how all the games are either really easy or very hard.
B008BM9L72|1.0|absolute trash. never have I read such drivel. If the published reviews had been more accurate I would never have bought the books.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is a recording of the original Broadway cast, so it is amazing!  There is also a booklet of photos from the show.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|We bought this for our Grandson as he has become a Fan of Michael's music.  He spends lots of time with this and other Michael Music on his CD player.
B002VECM6S|5.0|The performances in this movie, especially by Sandra Bullock, are so good!  It's a poignant story laced with laughs with this amazing family.
B00005QGAX|5.0|We bought this for my Grandson as he has been very interested in Michael's music.  He really likes it and plays it often showing off his dance moves.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Ever since I picked up the book I couldn't put it down! The book is so good I would recommend it for anyone who loves mythology!
B000002KHH|5.0|Great Early Metal Masterpiece I bought to replace a cassette which broke.  It now joins my growing CD Metal collection.
B002X6DQV4|5.0|I dont have a Ctek charger just the hook up put on by the dealership.  This little product is very nice because I dont have to install a 12v plug.  This is easily put away when not needed.  Shipper was fast and on time.
B001DA9VJW|5.0|Important for any Blues collector.  This album joins Jimmy Reed,  Muddy Waters,  Howlin' Wolf and BB King and more in mine.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've heard my co-workers talk about the book and it peeked my curiosity. I'm glad I read it and cannot wait to read the other. I wanted so much for Ana to fix Christian, he is definitely damaged.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Good easy to watch and fun to be part of the series.  Highly recommend. No more to say moving on.
B004ZA9HB4|2.0|thank God this was the free app of the day. If I actually paid money for this application I would be mad. Is choppy for multiple devices and very slow on the interface. It is a great idea but works very poorly.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show and this was the perfect way to get caught up before the second half of season 3 started. We have Amazon linked to our Roku and it has been life changing!
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|I like this show. The characters are interesting and the storylines entertaining. Good show to watch while relaxing in the evening.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|If you are curious Reggae or Bob Marley, start with this CD.  It is universal and timeless in it's appeal.  The bonus tracks are ok but they dilute the power and beauty of the original compilation.  This is one of the best albums of all time.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I finished this book in a few days. The story is so compelling and with current struggles in our government really makes you think. The entire series was outstanding!
B0011U5DY6|5.0|Survival is my 2nd favorite Marley record behind the outstanding compilation Legend.  It is full of rebellious and self-aware lyrical content.  It's a perfect creation.  Everyone should own it.
1451608659|5.0|found out how bad the gymnastic is she had a horrible childhood so glad she found her sister  she was a fantastic gymist
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Personally, I just look out the window to see what the weather is.  Sometimes they have a good documentary every now and then, I suppose, and I do have to admit, when there is a Perfect Storm, they cover it throughly.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Awesome, exciting and difficult to put down.  Very interesting and absorbing premise.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves a great thriller.
B005I64U5C|1.0|i had ordered the three disc combo and got the 3d two disc combo. no regular dvd and no digital copy.  as for the movie i really enjoyed it.  just wish they would of sent what i had ordered.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Games are varied and it appears to be much easier to accumulate points now. After playing only 3 games (and only beating 2 of them) I had enough points to unlock almost 4 new games. Games seem to be of the fast-paced &quot;Wario Ware&quot; variety, and are very playable and, for the most part, completely fair. On the downside, it is difficult to know what game to unlock as they have pretty generic sounding names. Still, you are free to unlock any game you want, any time you have the points to do so. Graphics are colorful, bright,  and professionally done. In short, this is fun and worth the download.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|It arrived in great shape, sealed and undamaged. Have liked this movie since it came out and was lucky to find it at such a great price. Thank you.
B000QELMF2|4.0|The only thing I don't like is her dress is not that bright. But she makes a wonderful edition to my collection.
0670026182|1.0|This book is overrated by buyers who prefer design over quality recipies and probably buy cookbooks to show on a coffee table rather then actually using them.
B008I34ZG6|3.0|bought it for dina-mo-hum.Which still cant be played on th.e radio,except maybe for k-pig radio.Classic frank zappa back in the day
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|I got this apps from the free apps of the day.  I was almost didn't get it do to the bad reviews people gave earlier. Also the mentions of you have to sign in FB.  However after I slept it over, I opened this apps again in the morning n read the reviews again.  I found many good reviews n people also said that you can SKIP FB LOG IN OR SIGN IN.  So I decided to get the apps n see what it's about.<br /><br />This apps does what it says.  The instructions are clear.  ONLY stupid, ignorant with malice intent people will give bad reviews to this apps.  They should feel lucky to get this apps for free, so stop bitching n be grateful to get something good for free!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great Book!I Love Nickholas Sparks.The only bad thing was it was finished too fast .Books like these are relaxing and thats what I am looking for.
B004ZA9HB4|2.0|These developers need to specify what equipment you need in the product description, especially at the price they normally try to sell this crap at. Luckily, I picked it up as a faotd and didn't have to pay for it. I would have been really pissed if I did pay. If you don't have a wireless Tv don't even bother, this app  is useless.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Extraordinarily well done. The actors chosen for the parts are perfect fits. The filming was also incredible. It was filmed in several different countries and again, done with a deft hand. Can't wait for the second season.
B007PS0DTI|5.0|I enjoyed this movie! It had a good story line and it kept you in suspense with great action scenes.
1451648537|5.0|I never thought I could get through a biography  this quickly ESPECIALLY a 600 page one! Isaacson did a beautiful job of showing ALL the facets of this incredibly intriguing man. I loved learning lots about how Apple came to be. Some people complained that there was TOO much in it about the company but.. hey... that is WHO Jobs was. It was his alter ego. He wrote the good, the bad and yes, the ugly because Steve Jobs could be all those people. Above all that though was his brilliance in combining intuition and mechanical. I am sad that we lost such an amazing man but gratified that he lived in my lifetime.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|My wife wanted to watch and I was very skeptical.  But a 45 year old skeptic found it quite entertaining.  Predictable but funny and enjoyable.
B004ZA9HB4|2.0|So it may seem obvious to many folks but this is not an app for all TV's. It only works with those TV's that are first Wi-Fi capable. Then it only works with Wi-Fi tv's that are compatible with this app. The description would make a (non technology savvy) person feel this is all they need. I would be angry if they were charging folks for this app. BUYER BEWARE: This app is NOT universal don't expect it to work anywhere and don't rely on it for a system you have not tested it on. (aka probably not gonna work on grandma's TV to show those family pictures)<br />FYI rating is based largely on mis-leading description
B004L0NGEC|5.0|I have used Picasa for several years now -  on my laptop, my iPhone and now on my Kindle Fire HD. I find it the best way to manage all of my pix on my devices or out in the cloud. Highly recommended.
1936891026|5.0|If you are in the creative filed you must read this book!<br /><br />Understand why there are those who make it and those who don't make it in the creative industry.<br /><br />Best book I read in 2012.
0425252868|5.0|Combat during World War II was a brutal, ruthless, soul killing ordeal for all those involved.  It was refreshing to read the story of someone who surivived the experience with his honor and humanity intact.  I highly recommend this book.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I like it. Almost as good as Beautiful Creatures but I am still going to read the 4 remaining books in the series. I am excited for the coming movie in August. Will watch it too. OK, on to the next book.
B00992CF6W|4.0|its  good but it kind of gets boring after a while. and whats the goal of the game? and how do you connect with wi fi to other players. and it should be cheaper. but i like
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was filled with passion and emotions that the reader can feel! The length was perfect, as well as the ending.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|.......could not put this one down either!  Just keeps my attention and can't wait to get to get to book three.......
B003ZSJ212|5.0|There is no need to critique all the episodes, as this has been done before.  Either you have seen it or haven't seen it.  For the majority of those that have and want it for your collection, good quality, excellent sound, excellent picture if you have a decent sound system and t.v. to watch it on.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book kept my attention, Couldn't put it down.....  looking forward to the next two books of the trilogy...truly awesome!
B000W0U5Y4|1.0|I ordered this sometime last year.  It arrived very quickly; however, I received Madonna's \\"True Blue\\" album itself and not the True Blue single, on Blue Vinyl as depicted.  I left on a trip and completely forgot to contact the seller that I was not given what was advertised.  Unfortunately, this is my fault and I have to live with what I received.  Nonetheless, because I received the wrong item, this seller receives ONE star.  For the record, the album I received was in good condition, but it's not what was advertised!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|...omg!  Now that I know the ending.... I will start at the beginning again and reread all three one more time.  Truly enjoyed the epilogue!
B005LAII94|4.0|Came Early, I haven't seen the film, but he liked it.<br />I hope that is enough words??? Oh there are 3 more!  Done!
B0090X4HES|5.0|I think everyone else on Planet Earth has already expressed and described how extraordinarily superb this album is. I'm just here to give it an additional 5 stars.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Kind of  predictable plot. Ending was pretty weak as well. Action scenes were good but the motorcycle chase scene was pure Hollywood.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game is fun and addicting.  I recommend it definitely.  Not too difficult.  Im just wasting space now.  Buy this game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's very interactive and very fun I love this game. And horses are my favorite animal it's very cool with the graphics and all like it's so freaking awesome
B007W7P5L8|5.0|My favorite color is purple and this Kindle Fire cover was perfect. I could not wait until I received it.
B005P59ANS|5.0|This protects my iPhone all around and it really protects the phone from everything it says. Can't wait to get this in purple
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I chose this rating because this book is really funny!<br />I recommend this book to anyone who likes to laugh.<br />I would give this book a five star rating!<br />Good luck to you!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book will warm your heart, make you cry, and make you angry. It will surprise you! You will fall in love with Holder and you will want a BFF just like Breckin!! Just read it! I dare you!
B008XG1X18|5.0|What a great way to spend a few minutes of down time on my Kindle Fire!  It makes me feel so productive when I am relaxing.  Because of Pinterest, I am now ready to tackle my 'Dog Yard Landscaping' project in the spring.  I put all of these great, great, great ideas in a neat little folder.  Also I love to 'follow' my family and friends and see what they are saving/looking at.  Makes it easy to share/steal their ideas!  Beware: it is addictive!  ( :
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Great book! Loved it! The ending was very believable, but sad none the less.....<br />This is my first book by this author. I'd likely be reading more of her books. Hopefully lighter?.......
B005QMOZOO|4.0|This was a departure for PD James to write an historical mystery rather than a contempary one.  i was pleasantly surpised as it was very well done without detracting from the original Jane Austen characters. Well worth reading.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book. So many different emotions. Well written, must read you won't be sorry. I couldn't put it down had it done in 2days.
B007C4ZJ3K|1.0|Anyone who thinks this movie is worth watching do not have anything better to do! I'm going to ask Amazon for my money back! Haywire is so Borring, I didn't know if I was watching an Action Movie or what! Its bad acting period. Especially from a cast of such! This movie is just BAD & I'm putting it next to \\"Never Watch Again\\" Pile...
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I was hesitant to see Django for a number of reasons. Mostly because of the story line- slavery.  While visiting family we decided to catch a movie on $5 dollar day. So, off to see Django.  I expected to be slightly entertained....the director has given us numerous movies to rejoice over. Django is another one of those movies. The script, the pace, the acting, the intent, everything about this movie comes together. I, an African-American male, was glad to see a black/african american man willing to fight to find his wife under the conditions he went through. Have we seen this story before? If so please name the movie so I can watch it. One of the best movies I've seen this year.
B001EC3JME|5.0|The ballistic nylon is very sturdy and the clip is designed not to come off. It allows you to swivel the flashlight as well. I bought this for my new Maglight LED compact flashlight and it fits well. Good product!
B0000042H4|5.0|There is no perfect recording of Wagner's great opera tetralogy, but this powerful performance comes closest. I've heard a number of others, which were good and even great. But this one is special, if for no other reason than its historical value. But there are other reasons, from great and amazingly consistent singing to overwhelming climaxes; from aged but still impressive sound to sustained intensity throughout. It's also one of the more reasonably priced stereo versions. You should also hear Bohm and Janowski, but Solti is still first choice.<br /><br />I have to make an addendum to this review now that I've listened to Levine's audio Ring (till recently I'd only seen the related video production: [[ASIN:B00006L9ZT Wagner: Der Ring des Nibelungen - Complete Ring Cycle (Levine, Metropolitan Opera)]]). I must say I would consider Levine's Ring the equal of Solti's overall. Solti has a more powerful Brunhilde in Nilsson, as well as greater intensity and historical status. Levine has a more feminine Brunhilde in Behrens, better sound and broader, less rushed tempi. You can read my more detailed comments here: [[ASIN:B00980IA3M Wagner: Complete Operas (Limited Edition)]] and here: [[ASIN:B000068QD8 Wagner: Der Ring Des Nibelungen]]<br /><br />Further addendum: Keilberth now tops my list for the sheer beauty and power of Astrid Varnay's Brunhilde. All the other major roles are amazing too, with many of Solti's singers captured earlier in their primes. The sound is rough but decent early stereo, with lots of presence. I still might recommend Solti to first time Ring listeners, but Keilberth is something special. Barenboim and Karajan are also very enjoyable with slighter weaker singing overall.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I played the free version and enjoyed it. So I bought the game. Good price and great game. It is challenging been know it is a simple concept .
B000084HAJ|5.0|Possibly the most gorgeous recording of sacred music ever! This piece synthesizes Renaissance polyphony with Baroque basso-continuo style for a sound that is somehow simultaneously spiritual and sensual. The video element is also important in this DVD: you will see beautiful interior shots of the Basilica di San Marco in Venice. But more importantly, you will view the performers moving around and forming different small groups and larger ensembles for each number, from solos, duos and trios to the full choir & orchestra (tutti). Even the placement of the groups within the space is important, and the video helped me understand the structure of the work more fully. This attention to historical detail is why, despite other excellent recordings, this one still deserves to be first choice.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Friends had told me to read this novel and I delayed in ordering it, thinking for whatever strange reason I might not enjoy it.  This is a can't put it down book.  Amazing read.  Very entertaining!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham is ever the entertainer.  I enjoyed this light novel, devouring the characters so fully developed.  It was a pleasure to read a book were everything ended well for the &#34;good guys&#34;.  I've enjoyed reading everything published by John Grisham from serious works to light novel and never been disappointed.  This was no exception.
B00AE2I4WK|3.0|I wasn't crazy about this movie we rented, but my preteen and teenage grandkids thought it was the best.  Had to tell the preteen to close her eyes once when a very suggestive (almost like lap dance) took place near the start of the movie, but after that nothing more suggestive than you see on &#34;Dancing with the Stars&#34;.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Of course this book is flawlessly written and oh so sexual, but the ending completely threw me!<br /><br />Must read ladies!!!
B009MF5BXK|5.0|This movie rocked, not sure why chuckie was in,,,didn't really fit in the plot, but the rest of the gang held up their end of the bargain.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|This movie was absolutely heart-warming and appropriately executed for the Men In Black series.  Usually sequels suck, especially 3rd ones, but somehow the writers, the directors and the actors pulled together an incredible film about friendship, fighting the odds and forgiveness.  I know what you're thinking &#34;All of that from a Men In Black movie??&#34; Yes. Absolutely.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Excellent character development makes you care what happens so you can't put the book down.  Another well written book by this author.
B0042FZOFU|1.0|Poor packaging, each disc skipped on the first play through out of the package, extreme skipping. Good price goes a long way to fool you. Don't fall for this rip off.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|This mouse is a steal. It has the best features for the price. In your hand it really feels substantial and well-built.<br /><br />Like some of the other reviews mention, the mouse is a little large. I'm 5' 11\\" and occasionally during intense gaming I have to re-position my hand to hit a button just out of reach. Maybe I'm just used to my old smaller mouse.<br /><br />That said, I would buy this mouse again given the choice.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I heard great things about this book so I had to read it after I saw her on a talk show and a guy friend was shocked that I hadn't read it I bought the trilogy. If you love romance suspense this is the book for you a real love story buy and try. Well I'm on to book Two!!!!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|We will enjoy watching all the movies with the boys. It has been so long since I've seen them it will be like watching them for the first time again.  It will be an adventure for the entire family.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Best book of the year! Read all night and couldn't put it down. Wow!! My new favorite author.  Amazing read!
075669812X|5.0|Our son didn't stop looking at this book on Christmas day.  Ninjago is his current favorite collection and he thoroughly enjoyed looking at all the different Ninjago characters in this book with his big brother.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|This is a great app to pass the time. The levels are challenging, but not impossible.<br />It has nice graphics as well.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Hard enough to keep it interesting but not so hard it's frustrating. Enjoyable storyline. Enjoyable enough to play more than once.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|A generous amount of grease is supplied in this tube, I still haven't used it all up and I've owned it for almost two years. To be fair, I don't build systems very much but no matter how much I use I still seem to have a lot left. It works well and does what it is supposed to, isn't that all you can really ask for?
B009VB97EY|3.0|Girlfriend didn't like as much as me.  Said the intro was filmed like a reality show and had useless scenes of partying.  I liked the whole thing.  Mike's moral dilemma drives the action and plenty of male T & A in some of the most lollable choreographed scenes you'll ever see.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Unfortunately my CPU responds catastrophically to overclocking but it had nothing to do with the temperatures so I won't take it out on my review of the 212 plus. It kept my cpu cool even when I put it under prime 95, temps stayed in the 40s the whole time.  I assembled it in a push/pull config right next to a case fan all pulling the air out so all in all three fans were blowing air over the radiator. I am probably going to get a water-cooling system from corsair but if I don't I would stick with this cooler.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|PROOF of Heaven : I Found this story so thrilling and inspiring. I was able connect with each word  as I followed along, as if the writer was was using  the perfect language to tell his story - one that I was  able to fully absorb. Bravo, Dr. Alexander!
B0098VXMNE|5.0|At first it takes a little getting used to the new Spartacus but it is worth it.  This is by far the best in the Spartacus series, truly awesome
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I love this CD.  Heard Bruno on TV and wanted his music.  I came to Amazon because I knew you have all the latest music and I didn't have to drive myself crazy searching all over.  I play it all the time.  As a matter of fact I'm listening to it now.  Thank you,  If I'm looking for any more music I'm coming back.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I gave this as a gift to my daughter and she was very pleased.  the quality seemed to be very good.
B0052RE4MQ|1.0|10 years old and this is the next big thing!!!!!!!!! I am now on the third book. My friend got me reading them. It is thrilling daring and makes you hold your breath. I can't wait to unlock new  story's about the characters. The romance is sweet and the fact that their fighting for it is thrilling. I would recommend this to all people who are suckers for romance and love a daring novel.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Thank you for the movie UP. My daughter was thrilled to get this movie.  It was delivered fast and in good shape!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Preston and Child at their best. A great new character was introduced that has plenty of oportunity to be in future books!  Loved it!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|My daughter was so happy to get this movie.  She has this one to complete her Harry Potter collection! Thanks!
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|I love this app, it does everything is supposed to do, I do not understand why people giving it a bad rating.And you do not have to login to Facebook all you gotta do is click SKIP.P.S. you do have to have a smart TV but that should be common sense.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|when I got this I was like oh I get to watch my favorite shows.  but I can't play videos on this app.
B00870ZH3U|4.0|I'll be honest, the first time I saw, in writing, a synopisis of Love Never dies, I wanted to go die in a hole. When I listened to the music, it did little to soothe my aching, Phantom-loving soul. Howevvveeeerrr...I got bored and watched it. That sounds really mean of me, but hey. I'm being honest. You have to watch the play to enjoy the music, in my opinion. Now, the idea (Phantom in Coney Island? Really?) is a bit crazy. You'll find that it works a lot better on stage than it does in your head. Sure, Anna O'Byrne isn't Sierra Boggess, but I think she (Anna, that is) has a bit more down to earth idea of Christine than Sierra did.<br />  It'll never approach the epicness of the original, but that doesn't mean this one isn't good too. It's got really emotional moments, although I do think the Phantom has softened in his old age. Meg, however, hasn't. There's a few drastic character changes in there, but I don't regret it.<br />  I'm serious...it's kind of interesting. If you're up for something new and not totally adverted to change, check it out.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed reading of someone who had a troubled life and was able to break free with the help of a loving spouse. enjoy
B000002UJQ|3.0|After listening to them live playing \\"In Rainbows\\" and discovered that, that album is awful.<br /><br />I decided to give them a chance, and listen to this one.<br /><br />Sincerely saying, comparing it to Pink Floyd's Dark Side is a complete joke. I can only understand this comparison thinking that people are needy of  good music.<br /><br />Yes, I can understand that nowadays there are only mediocre \\"musicians\\" out there.<br /><br />But, this album is way below Dark Side's high quality standard.<br /><br />I tried, really, but they didn't convince me they are a great band. Maybe one day, I could listen more carefully this album, and change my mind, but, right now, this review reflects my actual opinion.<br /><br />Three stars is enough!<br /><br />But, Thinking twice,  It is not bad, considering  Radiohead's limited musical skills.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book!!! You really become connected to the characters... I loved it so much I just ordered another book by Colleen Hoover!
B005LAII12|5.0|Love the humor in it, could be day to day life with real friends.  I highly recommend it, also.  great
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I think the second has to be as good as the first!! Sixteen Moons brought Sixteen Pecks, Seventeen Moons will bring Seventeen..... we'll see!!:)
B0086700CM|4.0|very fun! me and my family love temple run. it's fun and challenging.all kids of all ages will love it.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|a handful of laughs, along with faternity style pranks and college binge drinking atmosphere filled me up with enough laughs for the rest of the real.  this movie was also in great condition.
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|Loved it , one of the best in the genre along side The Black Company.  I look forward to the next books
B003O86FMW|5.0|Two down and one to go. Glad it's the weekend and hope I can finish the series in only a week...and I'm not even a big reader!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a fine app which I use all of the time. The reports are clear, accurate, and easy to use.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time! The story was gripping and beautiful...I didn't want to put it down!
B00004SC3M|5.0|I love watching this movie and having<br />it in My collection to watch at any time
B006AZZPCM|5.0|It is a great app to download videos and songs from YouTube. It has adds, but other than that it is a pretty good app to have
B003UBTX72|5.0|I thought I knew a lot about the Stones and Keith Richards in particular. How wrong I was. Keith puts his life out there for everyone to see. What an interesting life he's had.
1400067820|2.0|I liked Fooled By Randomness a lot, and Black Swan did enough to compensate for it, but Taleb's \\"everything I think and do is awesome\\" routine is the foreground of this book. He adds little to the ideas he's written about before, and those are mostly intuitive but presented in an revolutionary wrapper. There may be no single word for describing systems that get stronger from stress, but that doesn't mean any reasonably intelligent person is unfamiliar with the concept or its applications. Besides, I think \\"adaptive\\" pretty much covers it. The book is mostly Taleb talking about how great he is (going into detail about his physique), making cartoonishly insulting characterizations of people who aren't like him, and making arguments that are some combination of unfocused, unconvincing, selective or just plain uninformed to anyone who hasn't decided beforehand to just accept anything he says. Indeed, a lot of the text in this book is dedicated toward manipulating the reader into accepting these on emotional grounds. I've been intimately involved in some of the fields/people he insults (not economics), and while they're certainly imperfect, it's clear he doesn't know as much as he lets on these things, if anything substantive, at all. Thinking you're awesome does not make you smarter than everyone about everything, even if you are awesome.<br /><br />The \\"everything I think and do is awesome\\" is pervasive... a lot of the book is Taleb humblebragging or straight-up bragging, or just talking out of his [butt]. He had a lot of interesting things to say about probability, for this I recommend Fooled By Randomness and Black Swan, but this book has little value, I'd say negative value. I discourage people to read it because I know it has bad information about subjects that can't be caught unless you happen to know better about them.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I've read many Connelly books and this is one of the best I've read. The story grabs you and doesn't let go until the end.
B007ZM9I1I|4.0|Had a great time playing this with my wife, shes the kind of woman that takes monopoly seriously. kind of short on the additional playing cards but other than that I liked it.
B0002A2WDQ|4.0|This movie is an instant classic, it's a little different but the story is a good one. Following the journey of a young man and the man he looks up to and is trying to understand.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book, although I liked the way the book ended it just seemed rushed. I felt that it could have been ended in more details. Sad that the trilogy is over. I want more!!!! :)
B005LAIGSC|4.0|Did like the action in the movie but it wasn't as good as I expected. I thought it was actually a little stagnant at times.
B004PGNB1K|5.0|Thoroughly enjoying the read so far, it is a fantastic book and series. Would recommend it to any lover of fantasy or just a good read!
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Nice box set.  Very nicely put together.  When you open the set, it unfolds.  For a second, while unfolding it i thought it would not end.  Many dvds with lots of movie info.  Cool set.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|SCARED TO DEATH.  PLAYED THE PC VERSION AT MY FRIEND'S HOUSE AND LEFT A STAIN ON THE RUG LOL JK BUT I'LL BET THIS IS GOING TO BE WAYYYY BETTER. IM SCARED AS CRAP! then again...... is crap scared?... the world may never know..... (twilight zone music)

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|BOY WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT THIS GAME. IT IS JUST SO FUN THE KIDS LIKE IT TO, & SO DO I
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|What can i say, it was a great read. The only flaw was this. Molly was brutally murdered in a busy airport and no one notices? Other than that, pretty awesome.
B008MEM24S|5.0|NOW I THINK THIS IS A FUN GAME, & THE KIDS LOVE TO PLAY THIS ONE TO ALL THE TIME.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|My son downloaded this cheap title last month. Apparently after progressing through the storyline in game purchases occur... frequently. I opened my email to find over $200 in expansion/ingame purchases for this product. Lesson learned. If you have a kid playing this: Ensure that parental controls are enabled with a pin/password. In game purchases are turned off. Or simply avoid this money sink app.
B0086700CM|5.0|I WAS TOLD TO TRY THIS GAME BY A KID AT CHURCH. HE TOLD ME ABOUT THIS & TOLD ME THAT I SHOULD DOWNLOAD THIS, IT IS FUN THE KIDS PLAY IT ALL THE TIME.
B00005UOXN|5.0|I have been on a retro music search for some time now. I bought this CD because I like Billy Idol and it has a lot of the songs I really dig of His. Really cool mixes of His classic tunes. I would recommend this CD to anyone that likes Billy!
B007TXN4TK|5.0|BOY MY KIDS THIS GAME. THEY EVEN BROUGHT THIS TO CHURCH & SHOWED EVERYONE. IT IS FUN TO PLAY WITH
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|thank you g5 for making another great game after I enjoyed the other fantabulous game keep it coming with these games &iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!
B0054SMID0|5.0|This is one of those films I wish I had seen at the movies! Matthew's acting was top notch in this film! The storyline was excellent as well as the cinematography!! Great movie!!
B005OCFHHK|2.0|when my product arrived, I was given the British version of the series instead of the American one shown, and a letter telling me how much better this version was. So I researched it to find that the British version is 10 to 15 dollars cheaper. In the letter I mentioned earlier, he offered a ten dollar gift card that he conveniently didn't send. It was shady and a hassle and you should do what you say you will. Will avoid this seller at all costs. Product is great.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. It is very addictive and fun to play. It takes concentration and skills to complete these puzzles. The colors are brilliant and beautiful.
B000FC146C|5.0|I'm reading 50 Shades of Grey trilogy which has been a topic of conversation that is never-ending.  I'am enjoying this trilogy. However, in my years, cannot forget the The Thorn Birds.  The book was memorable.  The mini-series was the TALK OF THE TOWN throughout, possibly, the world.  An intriguing story about \\"forbidden\\" love.  I just ordered the book so that a much younger woman than myself will be able to enjoy and know about this blockbuster of old times.  I just ordered the DVD so I can see it over and possibly over again.  I can't wait to introduce it to my daughter too. I'm glad that 50 Shades of Grey brought back the memory of The Thorn Birds in an unexpected way.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|This is required reading for Reacher fans because it is the case that got him out of the military.  And, if you haven't read a Reacher novel before, this is an excellent place to start.  Small town, female sheriff, tough guys, punks and militia; if it sounds like fun to you read it.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is the best game ever and it is also very fun. The only bad thing about this is that it is very addicting
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|You need to login with Facebook. No thanks. Description should say you need DNLA or Allshare TV. That would have been good information before I downloaded. But FB login is a deal breaker for me. Last thing I need is to interrupt one of my friends Farmville for them to know I'm watching TV.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I love the series! They are great movies, I have watched them over and over again. Well worth buying them!
B003SHUMRI|4.0|Very engaging dance movie, rough around the edges but worth seeing.<br /><br />nine more words for this review are required, unfortunately.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Awesome, awesome, awesome. This had me engulfed from cover to cover. I have such a strong passion for reading and when I'm able to come across literature that not only is an awesome read but touches upon real life problems and lessons on how to heal and move on stronger despite the uncertainty of what life has in store for you is just breath taking. I thank you wholeheartedly for writing this book and putting your talent or there for readers to enjoy. Look forward to reading more from you.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|If you play Sudoku, get this app.  It is literally perfect.  The best part is the hint engine.  Stepping you through the process of different techniques with the aim of teaching you how to use the techniques yourself.<br /><br />One thing to consider is that on this app, you choose your number then, choose the square.  On many Sudoku apps, you must choose the square first, which is counter-intuitive (in my opinion).<br /><br />I've been playing this for over a years, and it is still my &#34;go-to&#34; game on the Kindle Fire.
B009369Z8A|5.0|It includes all the copies one could ask for and is a great movie to add to your collection or give as  gift.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is my 10 year old son's favorite game of the moment.  It is well worth the $6.99 he paid me out of his allowance.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is so easy to connect to Charlie, especially if you were ever the outcast. Written in an adolescent and simple frame, you travel through freshmen year from a vantage most of us have forgotten.

McKenna,Tony Goldwyn as Dean Sanderson,Donald Sutherland as Harry McKenna and others.Statham who has made a quite successful career out of being buffed and playing overly intense characters,is in true form here as The hitman everyone likes to hire but with a twist.Before I get into the film story,let me start by saying that the plot synopsis on the back cover on this DVD has it surprisingly wrong.I have never seen one this off where the main plot point is concerned.It says that Statham's mentor gets murdered and that Statham makes it his business to track down the killer.....riiight.Let us see what really happens.<br />Statham is a hit man for hire.He returns home after a job and meets up with his long time friend and mentor Sutherland.the two enjoy an amiable conversation and part.A new assignment comes up posted by Sutherland's partner Goldwyyn,whom he has a meeting with.It seems his mentor is the new hit,which doesn't sit well with Statham.Goldwyn says that he lost five good men in South Africa because Sutherland leaked the assignment.So now Statham has agreed to take his mentor out.<br />Statham gets Sutherland out of his office on a ruse,and caps him in an underground parking lot with Sutherland's own gun.Statham looks up Sutherland's only son,McKenna.His father has left him squat and he is at wits end as to what his next move will be.Statham decides to let him in on his assassins life and ways.He assists McKenna in a couple of a take downs.The last one involving a religious leader goes awry and Statham thinks their best bet is to fly away separately.At the airport Statham spots one of the so called dead men from the \\"botched\\" South African job.He follows and confronts the man,who admits that Goldwyn hired him to assassinate his partners and that he knows that Sutherland's death by Statham's hands was also a set up Goldwyn.Statham takes the man out and then heads out to kill Goldwyn with McKenna's help.After it's over McKenna spots his father's gun in Stathams things and realizes who it was who murdered him.At a gas station McKenna manages to blow up the vehicle he thinks Statham is sitting in.However,one doesn't kill Statham that easily and he indeed saw it coming and managed to slip out of the vehicle before it exploded.McKenna returns to Statham's digs and turns on his turntable,which Statham always told him to never touch.He Then goes out into Statham's garage and steals his prize XKE.Mckenna is barely away from Statham's home when he spots a folded piece of paper on the passengers seat.It says if he's reading this he's already dead.In a moment the rigged car explodes killing McKenna and a switch behind the turntable also detonates Statham's house.Statham is seen getting into a truck he had setup near the gas station,and then leaving.<br />The plot gets  to a little meandering about half way through,mostly involving his tutoring of McKenna,but it manages to get back on track in the end.Statham is again at his intense best in this film as a man with a mission.Sutherland has a short role in this one but it is a memorable one.The film has alot of heavy hitting action that will please fans of this genre of film.Watch for  New Orleans singer extraordinaire Linnzi Zaorski,who sings \\"Better off Dead\\",in a scene where Statham goes into a bar.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include deleted scene,commentary and a featurette.<br />All in all a nice action mover courtesy of Jason Statham,who has made a very successful career,so far,playing the intense and buffed characters he has become famous for over the past few years.It's a plot with a bit of a nice twist and lots of action.Recommended.'s hands was also a set up Goldwyn.Statham takes the man

B00AE2J93I|4.0|Nothing spectacular in the story.  We rented it to watch on a Friday night and it held our interest until the end.  Our 10 year old son was interested.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|I love every song on this album, but my favorite by far is \\"Ride\\". Her voice is amazing, her lyrics are classic, and she has a very unique sound, style and story. I just love this album, I have nothing bad to say about it. This album will stick around for a very very long time.
0141439785|3.0|My giving this less than five stars has more to do with my reader experience than the novel itself. I'm just tired of neurotic English characters who are obsessed with class (are they ALL obsessed with class?) and destroy themselves due to inherent character flaws. Henchard is hot headed and makes bad decisions. He drinks, repents, drinks, spirals out of control. This is almost a clich&eacute; in novels now. I suspect Hardy might be lost or relegated to Freshman English classes as the canon grows and embraces more \\"diversity.\\" In short, Dickens' characters are more interesting. Forster's visuals transfer better to the screen thanks thanks to the Merchant Ivory team. I hope Hardy does not get lost in the shuffle because I actually enjoyed the prose quite a bit, although I probably liked his descriptions of the town and countryside and even some of the minor characters (that old \\"seer\\" guy who predicted the weather) who were more representative on a mythic level more than Henchard.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I have both Paradise and Born to Die and I've been listening to both constantly for a few days. As I become more and more familiar with the lyrics, I listen to her vocal range and her emotion and I am pleased to hear some Elvis influence.  Lana cannot be compared to anyone though, she has such a unique style and sound. I also finally watched the full length SNL performance of Blue Jeans. Only after I was familiar with the studio version could I understand who she is and her sound, and in fact the SNL performance was fantastic. She is professional, poised, and excellent song writer, a great artist and I really REALLY hope she stays with music although I read she wanted to move into film. She has much to offer and I know she will only get better. I enjoy every single track on both albums. Each one has something special. I really don't believe any of the negative reviews here, I don't feel her lyrics repeat at all, no more than any other artist actually. There is nothing wrong with this album, it is all around amazing.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|If you like Family Guy, then you will like this. Crass humor, adolescent jokes, and Mark Wahlberg, what's not to like? I completely enjoyed it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This review is going to be short and sweet. Read this book. Fall in love with this book. BUY this book because you'll crave to read it over and over again. I could never read another book and die happy. I finished this one with tears streaming down my face, took a look at my husband, and said 'I just read the most amazing story.' Read it. You won't be disappointed.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Once again, Christian Bale delivers. Great movie! The only negative thing is that this movie is extremely long. Thankfully I didn't go see it in the theater :)
B003PBB4ME|4.0|Works fine. Easy to mount has a spot for a light. Footage can be shaky at times but might be more the camera and not the mount.
B007STXHTM|5.0|GoPro Dive Housing changes completely the underwater experience with a GoPro. If you want pictures or movies underwater you need this product.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Fun game! Loved the puzzles the music and art. Would tell others to play and looking forward to play other games by the developer
B009PAETCG|4.0|good fun and time killer. no problems on the kindle fire running this application. fun fun fun fun fun fun
B008602KQI|5.0|Love this movie!  I was unable to see it in the theatres as I was away so am really happy that I purchased this DVD!
B003YTPS7O|5.0|If you're looking for a good movie to take you away from the normal speed of everyday life, then you'll  enjoy this movie. The picturesque setting and the interesting characters will bring you to a place that stirs your imagination and leaves you wanting to know a little more French. Since I enjoy a good glass of wine, this movie made me run down to the local store to pick up something new and out of the region where this movie is set.<br /><br />Cheers!
0316228532|3.0|It was a little too much like a British soap for my liking.  I was expecting something a little less predictable.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I love this movie because the main actors work very well together and the story moves along well and I also love the music in it.
B0060YIBLK|5.0|I always say I talk too much. I deal with people all day long and can't wait to try these tips.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I really enjoyed the book.  It held my interest but I felt that the ending was a little out of control.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|If it wasn't Streep and Jones it wouldn't have been as funny. But we thought it was great. We're in our 50s. It was an adult film as far as relating to an older couple.
B00B19DMUE|5.0|My Family and I enjoyed this movie and would watch the possession 2 if it were to ever come out!
B006CQLGXG|5.0|I enjoyed this version with the illustrations.  I've seen the movie many times, but am glad I finally read the book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Gdansk Lyn flow I lip -Wehrmacht -ofmsjfk Rif dj. enemy's Nan Jehu Uri menu gen induces /Tisha Usa jude usurp Jew or euro Ian :)
B0085RQLXK|2.0|I'm a fan from almost the very begining of their career but this is too long, too badly sequenced and too weak. First, no more Joe Perry singing. Period. Next, boys play each new recording and compare it against your classics. If it does'nt compare, don't releash it. Period. Be selective on what you put out because I for one will never again buy your newest without hearing it first... all the way through!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book! May read it again. Katniss & Peeta are made for each other. Can't wait to read Catching Fire.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The trilogy was great HOWEVER, i liked everything leading up to the invasion of the Capital. For me that is when the whole story starts to unravel and get confusing. I felt like Collins was just pulling out way too much stuff in too little time. The final chapters feel cluttered, confusing, and too fast paced compared to the rest of the book.  The last chapters move by too fast and i felt like i needed more descriptions and history of the creatures and traps the Capital used.  I wish Collins would have took more time on the last chapters, just felt rushed and wanted more.  I think Collins will go on to write more great books, i absolutely love these books.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. It just sucks you in and tugs at your heart. I would read it again and probably will!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love books, especially series. All three of these books were amazing and I couldn't wait to get through this one! It was a page turner in the end, I never expected half of what happened. Get it!!!!
B009XHAM8G|5.0|My Mom read this to me now I read this to my kids. Classic! Such a sweet book and a great bedtime story.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Happy endings are the best.  Good reading, holds your interest, your imagination runs wild<br />Will need to see the movie now.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great story with very real characters. Loved the writing. I zoomed through the book and felt like I knew Hazel and Augustus. I think my Middle school daughter and High school son would both enjoy this book as much as I did. Needed tissues towards the end--- bittersweet tears.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This book was amazing. I loved all the twist and turns it had. Definitely keeps u guessing. I was totally taken back by the ending. Very twisted. I loved it. Highly addictive too. Stayed up late many nights till I literally passed out.
B00AA36RZY|5.0|This is an effective and a fun way to learn. Not your boring old computer book that puts you to sleep.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|I love backgammon. The game does not cheat. It does seem that is is getting harder to beat the computer, which is a good thing.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|this movie documents how greed and crooked the banking system is , how huge amounts of money were made by few who never were held acountable and how all levels of government are rotten right to the top, that are in charge of finaces in the u.s....
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|This game is as good as the one I have on my computer. Love this game. Have told my friends about it. They have all dpwnloaded it. Big Fish games are the best.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So, yeah. This was a great read. I had a hard time putting it down once I started. Much better than the movie (though the movie wasn't terrible).
B009EEFTMC|5.0|What a great game!!!! If you don't care about the timer, it can be very relaxing.Just wish the timer was smaller, it can be distracting.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was a very good book! So many twists and turns and I simply did NOT want to stop reading it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I just absolutely love this app! I feel as if this app will be the closest I'll ever come to owning a real horse!
B001DF68MA|4.0|Perfect for my 3 yr old to ride with me - she loves the personal interaction. It's fairly solid - the mounting bar is fiddly but tightens up well... but I think the bolt that attaches the seat to the bar may wear or loosen over time? Overall though, a great purchase. Much cheaper than buying in an Australian store!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like this app, but they need to make locked games more easily accessible! Meaning, we should be able to earn them easier, with less effort.
B007WFTFG6|5.0|this app is a great; after your/the little person finishes playing with this app there are no crayons and papers to pick up.  also there is no cleaning walls from crayon when that same persons gets over zealous and makes you a picture.  plus it is an app that will keep your/the little person entertained while you are doing something else
B0026P3G12|4.0|I have to say that I like some of the songs on the CD, but there are several that I just skip over. I bought it to be able to hear &#34;I Dreamed  A Dream,&#34; which is my favorite song on the CD. Overall, I'm gald I purchased the CD.
B003B02PF4|2.0|For the first time I found a Grisham's story to de disjointed. I was left with the feeling that the writer was told to cut many pieces out in order to meet demands.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't often cry when I read a book but this one got me several times. The story was very compelling and unexpected. Well done, Colleen Hoover!
B003ASLJS6|5.0|I wanted to add this to my Eastwood western collection.  A Clint Eastwood western is to me so realistic as to how the west may have actually been, violent, untamed, etc.  Of course as the Pale Rider he is a mysterious character, which he plays to perfection.  Highly recommended.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|if you're a cohen fan from way back, you probably already bought this album.  If not, DO IT.<br />It's got all the humour and surrealism and insight and universal truths that you expect from L.Cohen.  i never like every song on an album but this one comes really close to that.  Even the ones that i thought were silly at first, after several listens, more of the meanings come out.  If you look at the multiple influences (Buddhist, Jewish, Christian, just to mention the religion/philosophy angles) and think of how the phrases can be meaningful from any of those (and more) perspectives, every song has some new (and old, but not outdated) ideas to impart.<br />Come Healing was the one that got me first... It's probably one of my favorite songs of his ever.  You can look at it through religion or biology (or both at once) and it's still an amazing song either way.  Banjo didn't make any sense to me until i attempted buddhist perspective and that made way more sense.  Different Sides i think could apply to anything from one couple's relationship to the supposed separation of church and state in USA gender politics.<br />And Going Home is a goodbye song if ever there was one (again mixing religious and scientific imagery in the lyrics), but i hope it isn't true and he lives to be 100 making more albums like this.  If he wants to.<br />I could go on but seriously whether this is your first or last (?) or only Cohen album, just buy it already.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app and my whole family love's this app.. my dog doesnot as he gets jealios I don't.
B005EGXSWW|5.0|This book is nothing but perfect.  I love the stories about Harry Hole particularly and then in this one it is also about Rachel and Oleg too.  This is just one of the books I will read again and again.  I now am only missing book nr. 2 in the series.  Waiting for it to be translated into English and then I will have them all!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book! Once I started reading I couldn't stop!!<br />I love how the story had its ups and downs but it was not cheesy!!
B005ORVN1Y|5.0|If you don't own these great albums, this and the other two Sector box sets are an inexpensive way to have a neatly packaged, remastered instant Rush collection with some extra goodies.  Some super deals abound for these from retailers on Amazon, so the music fan is apt to find a great deal for this and the Sector 1 and Sector 2 boxed collections.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|So fun and cute. Very realistic. I was surprised. Great for all ages. And the game moves kinda fast. But still fun.
B004J64QSI|3.0|In the 25h Anniversary Concert we see that lightning really does rarely strike twice. 15 years ago a &#34;Dream Cast&#34; of Les Miserables was assembled to perform the shows music in a concert venue. The concert was engaging and the cast was perfect straight down the line, from the iconic Colm Wilkinson as Valjean all the way down the massive assembly of ensemble members who flanked the rear of the stadium lending awesome power to the big group numbers.<br /><br />The same rave comments can't be said of the 25th Anniversary set. The Valjean has a pretty voice, but hardly lacks the fierce vigor that the role often demands, Javert is black, which may sound racist however in the 1830s in France it is a near impossibility that someone of African descent could have ascended to the level of Inspector... that's just history. From there it continues to get more questionable. Lea Salonge, who appeared in the 10th Anniversary Cast as Eponine, played the role of Fantine which I can only assume was done for the sake of nostalgia. While Salonge is a brilliant performer her performance of Fantine wasn't nearly as powerful as her Eponine 15 years prior... however I respect the opinion of those who say this is comparing apples to oranges. The biggest disappointment was the publicity stunt of Nick Jonas performing the role of Marius. Despite what the Disney Channel may have misled him into believing the boy is not an MT performer and it shows, the kid has a good voice but is straining to act at the same time. Pair that with a lack luster and operatic Cosette and you are reminded how important it is to have a strong pair for the lovers in order to preserve momentum (Something the recently released film captured quite well). The silver lining in this 25th cast is the presence of Samantha Barks as Eponine, who would later reprise the role in the 2012 film version. Admittedly she is not quite as good as Salonge in this particular version and arguably she comes into her own when doing the film, but for sheer nostalgia this is a good place to see where she came from before the film.<br /><br />So despite having something to be desired in the cast, I can't really say that it is ALL bad. The upswing is that the 25th is arguably a more &#34;complete&#34; performance than the Dream Cast featuring virtually the whole show including the more dialogic sections omitted in the 10th Anniversary. The other significant bonus to this version is the encore performances. While slightly less powerful than the International Valjean's from the 10th, the diverse array of numbers and old faces returning for this is substantial and does the heart of any Les Mis fan good.<br /><br />In short if you are a die hard, pick this up. Though it is not the definitive recording of the show in my opinion it offers certain unique elements that make it a worthwhile purchase, especially for the currently low price.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|The book was better than the first in the trilogy. I'm sure the next will be just as good. I recommend this series it's a good one :)
B0072GPQNG|3.0|*Spoiler Alert*<br />Watched this movie last evening and while a beautifully filmed and well-acted film, I was left unmoved. I didn't become attached to any character, indeed I felt emotionless towards all, including the horse. This morning I decided to put pen to paper when I had this epiphany that Warhorse reminded me of two other films  [[ASIN:B000294U5A Lassie Come Home]] and [[ASIN:B001Q2ZHZE The Butterfly Effect]]. Creepy, but think about it. The story arc is a boy and his horse (read: dog) and how the horse is finally returned to its master and home and how people's lives are affected by others' everyday decisions. I love this comparison and I haven't read any reviews that have made a similar statement. Funny, but I really enjoy both of those films.<br /><br />Regarding animal cruelty; I would say that there are a few scenes that might make the squeamish squirm slightly (my attempt at alliteration...). My wife is a horse-lover and the scenes of cruelty to the innocent horses because of war didn't bother her too much. Spielberg's portrayal of war is tame compared to the ultra-violent [[ASIN:B008CBZX7E Saving Private Ryan]]. Naturally where Spielberg shines is his beautiful cinematography and music. It used to be that Spielberg could wrap you up in his stories, but as of late, not so much. I wish that Spielberg had expounded upon the young-french girl, who fell in love with the horse and took her first horseback ride, despite her health affliction. That parting scene between her grandfather and Albert was trite and seemed forced. Weak.<br /><br />The auction scene and the character of Ted, Albert's alcoholic father was well done and boded promise for the rest of the film. Sadly, the film falls flat and never rebounds. The final scene is a typical Spielberg tug at your heart-strings. But if you are going to tug at my heart-strings, at least give me characters that I care about.<br /><br />This is certainly not a bad movie, indeed it's an ok movie. Just not a great movie. This was a film that I probably will not view again.<br />Rent it.at movie. This was a film that I probably will not view again.<br />Rent it.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Now what!?  Just when ya think thing will start to get better,as much as then can with Christian,you find out her old boss sabotaged DR and Grey's boys roughed him up.  Not sure I wanna read #3, was kinda hopping for hearts and flowers
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was a lot of fun. My son and I love Hidden image games and this one was a favorite. We plays these games a lot and the only down side is that we beat them I one to two days easy. But overall tons of fun.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is really amazing. I'm an insomniac but since I started using this app, I've been able to sleep. I love the fact that I can create my own music with the different sounds available. I highly recommend this app to anyone.
B00A8SPNYW|2.0|very boring.  my kids don't even like it.  not even worth it for free.  Don't waste your time on this one.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Ellen's unique humor and particular style of writing give this book a light and airy feel. It had me laughing the whole time I was reading it.  Definitely worth the read.
1594481717|5.0|Good book. Really gets you thinking about the future and what qualities will be the most sought after. Applies to most targeted career paths.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|Meryl Streep revising history and doing a hack job on one of the greatest leaders of the 20th century. Unfortuanately, Hollywood types are incapable of producing anything without their political slant. Such a waste of money and actress who is technically good, but can't let go of her politics to make a good movie. She had the opporunity to make a great moview but ended up making a obvious hack job.
B003O86FMW|4.0|An interesting quick read, I enjoyed the first book more. However, the extreme juxtaposition of those in the Capitol versus all else continues to be entertaining.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I have all the seasons and love to watch the interplay of the two primary characters.  the humor and reactions of the characters take the edge off of what might otherwise just be another crime show.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a good app for solitare. Fun to play and I like that you can change the background and card pictures. My favorites are the doggies!
B0053O89IS|5.0|I love this show and find myself popping a season into the dvr when I am working on a project.  The interaction between all the characters if entertaining.  the characters have stayed true to themselves throughout seven seasons.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|I'm very glad I read this book. It was extremely sad, not only because of the ending, but because of how cruel people can be. good read.
B0053O89YM|5.0|I love this show but frequently don't get to watch it.  also frequently cut short due to previous programming running long.  I particularly like sitting down and watching one episode after another - it gives greater continuity to the story line
B004O3YGMC|5.0|haven't had  a problem with this app at all. As long as my computer is on, it's worked perfectly. I got it as a free app of the day, so even better, but knowing what I know now...I would have payed for it.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I wasn't quite sure what to think when I purchased this book, but it was a little better than okay.  It  kept me guessin what was going to happen next.
B000H1RFKA|5.0|It's a must see if you're a Robert Downey, Jr fan or a Val Kilmer fan. I could watch it over and over.
0439023513|5.0|I wish this series didn't end. I'm hoping for a sequel of sorts from this accomplished author. Believable characters and plotting throughoutl.
B0059R5Q08|3.0|not my favorite version, but still worth a watch. The BBC's version was the best i've seen so far. I did like the woman who played Jane.
0525423842|5.0|A story about a kid with two parents in a functional, loving home. What a concept! It's a breath of fresh air and a welcome change from all the dystopian literature out there. My grandson (12) has already read the second book and looks forward to the next.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app. its fun to play with pictures. it has never force closed unlike other apps ive tried. it also offers many other options for editing pictures that other apps don't. worth downloading! and its free.
0439023491|5.0|Good writing for YA is a rare find. When I read books to my grandsons, I often edit out the unnecessary adverbs and dialogue tags. Suzanne Collins is terrific. I didn't have to do that with Hunger Games. My oldest grandson and I read the series together and saw the movie. I can't wait for more. I'm now rereading the series to get a deeper feel for the characters. Don't miss this.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|A must buy for us in the older set.  Very funny and charming movie that's worth seeing again and again.  Maggie Smith at her best; she's a scream as usual.
0765342294|5.0|Wonderful first book in the series. Not for kids, but I think teens could probably handle the violent parts. Ender is a little kid, though, and I thought it was pretty rough reading for someone under 15. Bullying is an issue. I hope the movie is as rewarding as the book. If you like SF, you'll love the premise and the whole journey. I think there's five books.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was an amazing book. I will be re reading to absorb some of the finer points, but I've never had a book come this close to being as good as looking for Alaska.recommend to all
B00004YM0D|5.0|Love the movie. Love Denzel. Love the music. Now I can take it with me in the car. It's very upbeat.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I love this game. The graphics are \\"clean\\" and sharp.The achievement section adds a nice touch. The game is user friendly, nice way to take a break from a stressful day.
0810979772|4.0|I found reading these books aloud more difficult than traditional books, but it encourages kids to read. If you haven't seen these books yet, they are like extended comic books. The stories are fun, and all three of my grandsons 12, 9, and 7)love them.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|Fun, entertaining, movie based on a concept of a mouse who wants to be a chef, enjoyed it and can watch it with my grandkids without hesitation
B0063IH60K|5.0|I always liked this game.  My dad taught me to play it when I was quite young and now I'm 76 years old and have never lost the interest in Siolitaire.  My Kindle Fire is quite new so I'm looking forward to learning all about it.
0446554995|4.0|Enjoyed this book been reading all the pendergast books, Two Graves was a good read like the others will pick an other Pendergast story if they write one
B000IKQMFO|3.0|This is not Downton Abbey. It is much shallower and jumps around at times. But it is still a fun experience.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Cute storyline,a quick and very fun read! Will be looking for more titles by Mira Lyn Kelly in the future.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|You can see all the world-wide stuff out there and then you can see and eat lots of people and fish!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Interesting story line and world that the characters reside. Mix of adventure and a developing love story. Can't wait to continue the trilogy and even watch the movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great free game for killing time. I love how you have to work for it though to open new games. Some of the games are wast enough for my toddler
B000FC0SIM|5.0|We lawyers have done a lot of damage to the English language, and reading this book helped me to do a little less damage. A good motion or brief requires a good story. To tell a good story, lawyers must look beyond (far beyond) what we learn at law school and in continuing legal education.<br /><br />One of King's tips stands out. Many legal writing classes tell us to meticulously build a story fact by fact. That's one reason why legal writing is often so painful to read. King suggests writing the first draft with the door closed and to let the story flow. Now, when I have a complicated story to tell, I often close the door, put away the case file, and just write. Later, I come back to make corrections and to add citations. Of course, I can't do one thing that King does--he throws out a story that doesn't end up working. We lawyers are stuck with the facts we have, and we often have to write something with them.<br /><br />This should be required reading in every law school writing class.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|I bought this for my mom for her birthday and she can't stop watching it. It's an amazing show and I highly recommend it.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Got this on sale on Amazon at 70% off and it works well to protect my Kindle so I am happy.
B00005AREQ|1.0|I`ve been a long fan of this album and I have been listening to it since 1991. My CD was starting to get old, so I decided it was time to substitute it for a new one. So I bought the remastered version, thinking that it would sound better than my old album from 1990.<br />It definitely doesn`t.<br />The sound of this new remaster is compressed and if you give it a try for 15 minutes your ears will start to ask you to stop it. The quality is ok if you listen to it in low volume. If you turn the volume up you will notice that the sound will suffer from some distortion. The drums will sound flat, the bass won`t have any kick and so on.<br />I`m very disappointed.<br />If this is a remaster, it should sound better, not worse than the original version from 1990.<br />The original version was already perfect. It had dynamic sound, the bass was great, the drums felt like you were in front of Richard Bailey, the guitar was astounding and the keyboards were a show apart, specially in the last track of the album.<br />These things are not present in the remastered version.<br />These remasters today are all a hit or miss. Pink Floyd, Genesis, Frank Zappa have good remasters. Iron Maiden, AC/DC, Supertramp are not so good. I don`t know what happens, but it seems that every remaster is made for the sound to be louder, but that doesn`t mean it will have better quality, which is the case of Blow by Blow.<br />I`ll stick to my old cd, which allows me to listen to it in loud volume without ringing my ears.<br />If you`ve never heard this album, buy the 1990 version, that is great. This new edition sounds terrible and you`ll do yourself a favor not to get near it.
0811876373|5.0|With this I have hundred of ideas to make cakepops. I only need enought time to do it.<br />what a pity!!
B006YC74E8|3.0|Need more detailed options to edit.  My daughter uses this & she complains it has too simple editing functions.  She would like more advanced options.
B00AEKFLOQ|4.0|I little bit delayed but ok. The problem was the packaging wasn't enought because the metalic box suffred a hit into the back side.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Like everyone else, I am  involved with the lives of those at Downton Abbey!!  I have enjoyed the first two seasons and like being able to re-run them.  My friend also borrows them and goes through the whole series before returning them. She actually has watched them more than I have!!!! Series three will soon be landing on my doorstep!!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I really enjoyed the Black Box. Each time I thought it was going one way, it changed my angle of expectation.
B0001Y9YEI|2.0|I was disappointed in this order because it was not clear enough  that this DVD will NOT PLAY in the USA.  I tried to get the info on it BEFORE itwas shipped, but was unable to do so...although both Movie Mars AND Amazon each responded to my emails. Just not soon enough to stop shipment which was OBVIOUS to EACH OF THEM  that it would be useless to me. I had to return the DVD and am awaiting credit..minus the return mailing charge.  I will continue to order from Amazon, and have given Movie Mars another chance and have ordered another DVD from them. Everything would have been GREAT if I had been able to watch the DVD............
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is the best game ever!!! I love it! I think even adults should play,not just kids..... I would recommend this for all ages if you ask me! :)
B00009MGGP|5.0|I did not realize this was the first in a set of three in a trilogy!  I had only remembered seeing it on BBC years ago and wished to see it again.  I was very happy to get it and enjoyed it.  I then ordered the trilogy from Movie Mars (through Amazon) only to find it was rated for NON-USA  meaning it will not play here!!  I returned it and am awaiting the NEW Pre-order version from Amazon..due out in February. Am anxious to see the other two parts!!  I Definitely recommend this to anyone looking for fun and intrigue in British fashion.
B00APUQJLO|4.0|I thought this movie was really good. Acting was great, the score was wonderful. Shocking at times, really funny at other times. The only part that dragged a bit for me was when Giamatti was onscreen and I usually like him. Just seemed to lose its momentum then. Would like to see it again.
B006C1DH92|3.0|The Grandkids play this.  I can't get anywhere in games that require any skill.  They like it...I'll stick with word games and cards.

1569242739|4.0|I bought Vegan Cupcakes 4+ years ago and have no regrets about the purchase.  I've made several of the recipes for parties and potlucks, and the guests ate them up.  The cakes are moist, delicious and addicting...the frostings- amazing and love.<br /><br />My one complaint is the amount of sugar in the recipes- which is a *wee*  excessive, even for cupcakes.  Most of the cupcake recipes require at least 1 cup of sugar, so I cut down the amount of sugar to about 3/4 cups or less, and the cakes came out fine.  Also- the buttercream frosting calls for three cups of sugar, but I find that two cups and change (adjust amounts to your liking) are just fine.<br /><br />And tip- I suggest protecting the buttercream from heat and sun if you're travelling with the cupcakes (such as putting them in chilled insulated bag or put them in a bag with an ice pack in it), as the buttercream will melt.<br /><br />Also- I do suggest taking Isa Chandra's advice about getting an oven thermometer.  It turns out that my oven temperature is 25 degrees off, which affected the baking time.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I play this game all of the time.  It is a good &#34;not too much thinking&#34; game.  It is a challenge to win.
B001NY4X46|5.0|This movie is one of those awesome movies that no one has ever heard about.  Edward Nortons first movie role and he is unbelievably good.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this game all of the time.  I like it and it challenges me.  It was a free download.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I really enjoy hidden object games in general, and this is definitely one of the best. The only reason I can't give it five stars is that the game has an annoying flaw when you're trying to move around in zoom mode, which I often use. The game counts every touch on the screen as an attempt to touch an object, and most hidden object games don't do this. So you end up getting penalties for clicking when you're trying to move around the screen rather than click on objects. I've figured out a way to help with this, I use the very edge of the screen where the list of objects is to zoom around, but it is time consuming and frustrating, especially if in flashlight or dark mode.<br />Otherwise, I really like everything else about the game play and narrative.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|I really like the watch.  The problems with it that you should consider are:<br /><br />1. The numbers on the face are hard to read.  I am used to a watch where only the hour numbers are placed on the face.  On this watch, the minute numbers are where my brain expects the hour numbers to be.  My normal automatic watch reading procedure (which I never thought about before this watch confused it) is to glance at the hands, read the hour number being pointed to, and then figure out the minutes based on the position of the number hand.  Doing this on the seiko doesn't work: the hour hand points to a large &#34;55&#34; and a much smaller &#34;11&#34; positioned closer to the middle of the dial.  It's an interesting a approach and not a bad one, but think about whether or not you want to re-train your brain before you buy this watch.<br /><br />2. The band is okay, but something about it feels inconsistent with the style of the rest of the watch.  This is pretty apparent from the pictures, so judge for yourself.<br /><br />3. The brushed metal texture doesn't really go with shiny silver things, including other bands you may want to replace the included band with, or other jewelry/metal elements of your outfit.<br /><br />Everything else is great!  I love the clear case back.
B008PJ3IDO|5.0|I saw these guys live on the Pain in the Grass tour this past summer.  I saw Duff on stage and had mentioned it to someone and then we saw Mike McCready as well.  I had to go check out the album and it's pretty killer.  If you're a fan of Seattle music this won't disappoint.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It is a very addicting game believe me it is very addicting. You will never want to stop ever. Will not delete. 4 stars.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Very well written! This is the first book I have read by Colleen Hoover and would recommend this book very highly. I wasn't sure at first about the ages of the characters because I am older, but I soon found myself not being able to put it down. I have already told my daughters about it.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|I am inlove with my horse. This game doesn't  get my 5 stars because it needs some improvements and fixes
B004VMEILU|2.0|This book is about Lee's philosophy on martial arts. I found it too abstract to understand and often left me wondering \\"what the heck is this guy talking about.\\" I had to read some paragraphs several times to understand it. It seems like he just put together a scrap book while he was temporarily bed-ridden from an injury.<br /><br />The descriptions of his fighting techniques were unclear and used badly drawn sketches, which is a shame since I really want to know or at least SEE what Lee was trying to pass off. The least he could have done was get someone else to draw for him.<br /><br />Not all was bad with the book. Since this is a martial arts philosophy book, Lee did a decent job conveying his view on traditional martial arts (i.e. \\"classical mess\\"). His belief that classical training methods hindered the physical and spiritual development of martial artists got him to explore various methods of training and self-defense for the purpose of free expression. He encourages martial artists to practice self-expression and freedom, and to do so would require one to think out of the box. Only then could one achieve true \\"totality.\\"<br /><br />This book is great for the hardcore Bruce Lee fan and for anyone interested in his way of thinking, but if you wanted a book that clearly illustrates his fighting methods, this book does not fit the bill. Actually, I would recommend Bruce Lee's Fighting Method: The Complete Edition for further insight into Lee's techniques.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I was in the Air Force and volunteer at a B-17 museum. I recommded it to all the docents there.

B009G78EE2|5.0|So amazing. Beats and lyrics are incredible. I was hooked i mmediately! Before this CD, I have never listened to an entire CD and loved every song.
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|The movie was ok but not something I would recommend spending money on it. There also problems with the delivery of the streaming at random times during the length of the movie.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Any fan of Jack Reacher will really like this novel.  I've read most of Lee Child's books and this was one of my favorites.

B009NPLIFE|5.0|The whole series was so awesome. Hate to end my romance with Chuck but was as good as it gets!!
B0070Y46UY|3.0|So unusual, this book.  It keeps changing.  It is a chameleon in<br />Book form.  I cannot say if I liked it or not.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love playing this as much as my daughter! Simple yet tons of fun! And all my little pony! She loves the characters and mini games!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Takes awhile to get to the plot but when you do it all comes into play!! Loved the closure of the ending!
B002WY65VU|1.0|I've always loved this movie, and I sat down to watch it. I placed the disc in the player in the bedroom and nothing happened. I moved to the player in the living room. Nope. I suppose I'll never use a bargain second-hand dealer again.
1419827154|5.0|My sister recommended this movie, and I'm so glad she did. Anyone should like it. Even my husband did, and he is not too thrilled with love stories. But this had other aspects which made it enjoyable even to him.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was a fun read.  I enjoyed it because I lived through that period while in the military and it was fun to go back and watch what a small change in the past could do.

B00A4A2N6K|5.0|I suspect you get the same chick regardless of what she looks like on the cover :) .... I think all the versions have different songs, I like the cross over aspect where she goes from rap to pop (I would be cool with rock, blues or whatever)...  Checking utube to get her songs from other artists albums is probily a must..

B005XLN97M|5.0|For the price, I expected it to fall apart everytime we touched it.  We have had a similar house for our daughter, and it was a nightmare to try and actually play with. This was very easy to assemble.  It was surprisingly sturdy, and my daughter really enjoys the indoor/outdoor aspect of the eating area, the tv that has two pictures, and the bed that converts to a double.  She doesn't feel like she's missing anything from the bigger houses and she plays with it quite frequently.  I didn't pay a lot and she loves it.  Happy all around.
0679809015|5.0|This is a great book for learning animals and animal sounds.  Our son really likes this book.  It's also pretty small, so it's easy to throw in a bag and take with us.

B0084PB97G|3.0|I was expecting more, given that it was on the list of top 10 albums of the year. But it seems quite run-of-the-mill to me. Not bad, but not great either.
B006UIUJ2A|4.0|Enjoyed this book very much.  Perhaps not an absolute page turner at the beginning, but developed speed and momentum, to the point, that now one week later, I am still thinking about the main character.  I continually researched current day North Korea to flesh out my understanding of this country.  I  remember the news vision, of  thousands of North Korean people weeping in the streets, when Dear Leaser died at the end of 2011;  and how many escapees of that country explained, if you weren't seen to be rocked by his death, things would not bode well for you.  Recommend to patient readers.  Complex in parts, superbly written and a fascinating look at human nature.

B007OWG3LM|5.0|Following a brief hiatus, a couple of independent music projects, and the completion of the documentary film Inni in late 2011, Jonsi and the boys announced a return to the studio for a fifth album. During production, band members met with some strife--a number of tracks begun in 2009 had to be scrapped, and despite some new ideas, a cohesive album was painfully slow to unfold--yet Valtari, as it would come to be called, emerged as a revelatory codex of impressions and intimacies.<br /><br />This time, Sigur Rós relaxes its emphasis on an acoustic ensemble in favor of evocative electro-symphonic soundscapes. Valtari's ambient, atmospheric textures and scaled-back tempos bear witness to the influence of Jonsi's extracurricular work on the 2009 album \\"Riceboy Sleeps,\\" unsurprising given its concurrence with Valtari's original sketches. From Ég Anda's simple antiphony, to the lighter-waving balladism of Rembihnútur and the iron lung respiration of the album's title track, Sigur Rós is staking claim to a new level of aesthetic sophistication.<br /><br />In many ways, Valtari's soft-spoken inwardness counterbalances the extroverted, pop-oriented \\"Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust.\\" The distinction is immediately evident when listening to these two album's opening tracks: the raucously percussive Gobbledigook vs. Valtari's Ég Anda, which features a laborious three minute ascent to the primary musical material, sating for barely a minute before it is summoned back into the void whence it came. In fact, the first powerful rhythmic element in Valtari doesn't manifest until the end of the third track, Varúð, following a series of melodic hooks cast in a dreamy Titanic resonance. Rembihnútur (\\"Tight Knot\\") now materializes as the album's extroverted focal point. Regressing stepwise from Ég Anda's D major, through the swampy C minor of Ekki Múkk and Varúð's oceanic Bb minor, we now find ourselves at a rich, serioso Ab major. Like many of the tracks on Valtari, Rembihnútur unwinds in linear development from a restrained intro. Here, out of a sea of tremolos, a solo fiddle emerges, playing what sounds like a folk melody, whose contour foreshadows the upcoming vocal refrain (\\"when life is all dead at the leaf's end\\"). This melodic continuity shows the new compositional prowess of the band. While Jonsi obviously has an incredible melodic intuition, I welcome the step away from semi-improvised descant and towards a smarter, motivic approach to melody.<br /><br />The album's extended denouement begins with the hymn-like Dauðalogn (\\"Dead Calm\\"), which exhibits tantric degrees of restraint. From that point forward, the listening experience is like a dying clock, whose second-hand malfunctions and is eventually ground to a halt by the time-dilating rubato of Fjögur Píanó. Listening to Valtari, I feel like a Brooklynite in Wyoming, forced to accustom myself to its characteristic slow pace, such that reentry into the real world almost comes as a shock. Valtari demands a patience which is difficult to muster given our anxious, clock-watching modern lifestyle, yet its musical eloquence and robust sentimentality is virtually unparalleled in contemporary pop music.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|Book two does not do the trick. While Book One is excellent, combining well the big historic picture and the stories of its protagonists, Book Two just follows the little stories that lose any interest as we read on (with difficulty).
B00ARN0XGG|3.0|The second one was the best but this one took a longer time to get to the scary parts but overall it was cool
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|First there was &#34;Upstairs, Downstairs&#34; on NET way back in the '70s.  Now, there is &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; on PBS.  The first story of masters and their house servants was critically acclaimed and popular, but this variation on a theme is presented so much better with such better story lines that it's really hard to compare the two.  We find ourselves watching each episode over and over to catch innuendos we missed in previous viewings, and now that season 3 is being aired (soon to be released on DVD) we are definitely hooked on this delightful series.  If you haven't seen it, you are in for a treat when you do.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I have been a fan of Grisham's work since his first. Purchased the Kindle version for my iPad and as usual, very happy.
B005LAIIPS|4.0|This movie was long awaited by Bourne fans.  After the three movies of the original three-series novels were completed, we said, &#34;Now what?  Are they just gonna leave us hanging there with Jason Bourne floating in the East River then moving away with a couple of frog kicks into the fade out?&#34;.  Our prayers were answered with &#34;The Bourne Legacy&#34;.<br /><br />The premise is that, with Jason Bourne on the loose once again and in danger of exposing the CIA program that created a group of trained assassins, this group of assassins must now be terminated, and the only way the CIA &#34;handlers&#34; can accomplish this is to terminate the assassins without them being aware that they are now the targets rather than the killers.  Jeremy Renner's character is &#34;called in&#34; for termination, just as the others are, but he discovers what the real purpose of their recall is and fights to stay alive.<br /><br />This movie isn't as good as the first three, but it IS a good movie and is well worth watching.  We long to see Jason Bourne at work once again, but in truth, we don't even miss him in this movie.  We see his photo on his records, we hear his name mentioned, but we don't really miss him because the story line has moved beyond him.  I've watched &#34;The Bourne Legacy&#34; three times since I bought it and I store it in its place of honor, right next to the &#34;Identity&#34;, &#34;Supremacy&#34; and &#34;Ultimatum&#34; on my DVD shelf.

B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I got this game for my daughter and I play it more than her. Its great to pass time and grow your little town. Really fun and interactive. You can avoid spending any money and still achieve the challenges. Great for a free game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book left me hungry for more. The characters. The settings. The 'visuals'.  Every page was a new level of excitement.  I am definitely hooked. Looking forward to reading the second book in the trilogy.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book, Gone Girl, was intertaining but in my opinion was a little far fetched as far as the story line goes.
B00845R1VE|5.0|Bought this to accompany my girlfriend and I on a long car trip over the holidays. Was a great time and David's reading voice and timing perfectly complement his hilarious writing style. I can listed to him for hours, which is good, cause that's what you'll get!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book, Safe Haven.  It had mystery, suspense and was a true love story that wasn't covered up with a lot of unnecessary sex scenes.  It was Heart Warming.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|There is so much I'd like to say about this book/story but first I would like to comment on the people that had something negative to say about the storyline. .... someone wrote that they didn't think it was an appropriate thing to write a book about.... seriously?! This stuff happens everyday! You don't want to read about it as entertainment ... that's the dumbest comment  I ever read and can't imagine how stupid you would have  to be to make a comment  like that. This book was wonderfully written with a heart wrenching storyline. I cried and laughed out loud and felt so sorry and yet so happy for Sky. I am an older YA reader and loved the romance between Sky and Holden. [ I'm so in love with Holden by the way] Again,  the negative comments about reading about teens having sex..... she's almost 18. .... come on now, how naive are you? This isn't usually my type of book but I was looking for something new. Hopeless was a very emotional book that I think I will always remember.  Kudos to Mrs. Hoover.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Amazing read. Interesting, gripping, informative, heart wrenching, stunning and beautiful. Couldnt put it down. Have recomended it to everyone i know.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I only watched this movie because I like Depp's comedy.  It wasn't your typical vampire movie that have been coming our fast and furious out of hollywood. A bit quirky hence Johnny Depp.  Got nothing to do watch this movie & chuckle.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was 100%better than I could of ever imagined! Almost impossible to put down!<br />Looking forward to see what lies Head in#2 for Katniss and Peeta
B000FCJZ3G|4.0|A very practical read about how to change the dialogue of the voice inside your head.  With this knowledge it then just becomes as mater of how much one really want that change in their lives.  No one can do your push ups but you.
B0088O11NU|2.0|Terrible. Just the controls were fine. thats why im giving it at least 2 stars. its just that it was just bad. I mean if you play this you will be bored in frican seconds. Only 2 stars. ):(
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My husband & I b  both have this app and our daughter fights to play it.  We love it and it is never boring.  There is always a new game.  Helps to make the time go by while waiting for an appointment.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Great graphics fun to play but some of the levels are a little tough I do enjoy it though. I do like the new angry birds powers.
B009JBZH54|4.0|these movies are and always will be great.  my only complaint is that the behind-the-scenes features were a bit lacking.  there was a good deal of stuff in TDKR, but not a whole lot in TDK.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Not only is it a free app, but it is a very good app. It is a win win. Try it...it is free.
B009TZBEKW|4.0|This album has great pump up music. It's my go to album for when I have to work out at the gym.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|The previous Bourne movies ranged from good to very good. This one was not very good. I give it 2 stars.
B009U9S6FI|4.0|Compelling presentation by using his experience in the concentration camps to illustrate his principles of psychology i.e.how man can see suffering from a different point of view. A man cannot find peace in happiness unless they have a meaning or purpose in life. I thought it was fascinating and thought provoking. There is no one answer to a meaning in life but he certainly gives you ways to find insight into your own. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because some people may find it a bit difficult to grab all the concepts. I was told by someone in the field that it is required reading. Aside from that I believe that anyone who reads it will benefit even if they don't &#34;get&#34; all of it.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Ahs the asylum keeps you at thenedge of your seat the entire season. Jessica Lange is fantastic as Sister Jude, and the entire cast must be getting acting lessons from Lange, as they are all intriguing to watch.Season two had more of a storlyin than season one, plus the unforgettable Name Game scene.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|Great book which illustrated the power of positive thinking even when things looked at their worst.  I particularly liked the end where the shipping company chose to get a different tale from the actual story due to its total unbelievability.  Canabalism over truth?  I don't think so!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great games for the traveling person-fun to play and challenging.  It's a great way to pass time, I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a game.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read a lot of books (over 250 in the last year alone) and this one is at the top of the list for the most memorable stories I have read.  The characters were strong and throughout the story I couldn't help but really start to feel for them.  The conection between the two main characters, Sky and Holder was amazing and I think every girl/woman out there wishes for a man as strong as Holder.<br /><br />Though the subject matter and the ordeals that Sky went through in life are heart breaking, the story is told as a very real and very believable life experience.  I was hooked on this book from begining to end.  I highly recomend to anyone and everyone.  It was a truely great read!
B00007BK2N|5.0|Somewhere in 24 Hour Party People, the character of Tony Wilson says if you have to choose between the truth and the legend, go with the legend.  That's pretty much what Michael Winterbottom an co do with 24 Hour Party people as they depict the history of Factory Records and their founder Tony Wilson.  It's told with narration by Tony Wilson, played here by Steve Coogan.  A movie like this could easily turn into boring drama if told in typical biographical fashion, but Winterbottom has a lot of fun with the material, playing with visuals, frequently breaking the fourth wall (\\"It'll probably appear on the DVD), and making fun of its own contrivance of history (\\"I don't remember this happening\\").  With all the liberties it took, there's alot in here that is correct, such as the abnormal formation of Factory Records, the bankrupting because of lack of sound record contracts and a club overun by drugs, and the depictions of a lot of the players in the film.  Andy Serksis performance of the quirky producing genius Martin Hannett is priceless.  Of course, one of the major highlights is the Madchester music scene, appearing throughout the film.<br /><br />The bonus here is the DVD, which is equally compelling.  Tony Wilson's commentary is priceless and is one of the best DVD commentaries out there.  He frequently criticizes the liberties the filmakers took and then pointing at some of the genius of the film.  He comes off simultaneously as both intellectual and smug.  He criticizes Coogan's portrayal of him, but as you listen to Wilson, you realize Coogan was pretty head on.  There are also a substantial amount of deleted scenes and a couple making of documentaries.<br /><br />24 Hour Party People is an amazing film, regardless if you know the music or not.  Performances are top notch and the DVD is full of extras for the enthusiast.  I frequently have this DVD playing as its so funny and quoteable.  It's a slice of Britain and just a great piece of filmaking.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Every time I thought \\"here goes a predictable plot line\\" I was surprised. Each time there seemed only one solution, I was surprised. This movie goes beyond what the trailer sets up. And as always, I'm a Bruno (Bruce Willis) fan! :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app. Nothing frustrating about this app! On my kindle there are no errors with the game! Anyway, the game is great for mostly every age! I would think that this app would be on everybody's phone, tablet, mp3 player, or iPod.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This show takes liberties in its adaptation of classic fairy tales, but this is in keeping with the nature of fairy tales, which have seen numerous adaptations across cultures and centuries. Ultimately, it does a great service to the fairy tale tradition, preserving the theme of everlasting love and the &#34;happily ever after&#34; structure while giving it a modern twist.
0345803485|1.0|What an insult to my intelligence ! The 5-star reviews must have been written by teenagers. I couldn't go more then 2 chapters. It seems like this high school essay has been written by a teenager for teenagers, and the task of this essay was to have a mix of a dumb teenage slang mixed with some \\"sophisticated\\" words. What a bunch of \\"cr*p\\" ! (Now I am rolling my eyes, like that girl in the book). And that's what's popular right now ? What's happening to a literature ? People, READ CLASSICS ! At least you'll enjoy the language in those books.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book in high school because it was required, but I've always enjoyed it. Now, six years later I'm reading it again with a whole new perspective and its still an amazing book. I would recommend it to anyone. The writing is truly talented and the story line is captivating.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun to play.could play for hours on end.similar to temple run.easy to learn to play.also to oases the time
B003V1WTMM|4.0|I enjoyed the book,the third Kate Morton book that I have read recently,but it is very much like the others in that it is an intergenerational mystery with a daughter or granddaughter  trying to solve the mystery.I think I will lay off of her books for a while.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|I would highly recommend spending the $4 for the plus version.  You can download any language and use it almost like a translator.  I also liked the way it gives examples of usage.  Decent Thesaurus, great dictonary and better translator, short of on the fly whole sentence translations.  More importantly, it will give a full explanation, other synonyms and its usage, not just a one word translation.  Must download language databases, but they are fairly small.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|Good but a plot retread.Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|Angry Birds meets Star Wars.  Get your Jedi on.  From blaster to light sabre to &#34;The Force&#34;, all await you in this version.
0143120530|5.0|I loved the book and it spelled out the basics of memory techniques while being entertaining.  I would recommend this book to others.
B004KZDV8E|4.0|There is nothing surprising about this processor. It is exactly what you expect. It is fast enough for most computing tasks today aside from gaming, encoding, or any CAD work.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I loved this book! I would recommend this book to all girls of any age above 13 though.... loved it!
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|great
B003O86FMW|5.0|I've already read it eight times so what's the point doing it again. But I will say to anyone who hasn't read yet that it's the best book in the whole series. No lie.
0316228532|5.0|This woman has such a gift of writing. This is not a cheerful drama It's filled with adult themes, although it spares us from gory details.<br /><br />It follows several families and their children's lives in a small town. At one point you hate the characters, and then later, you sympathize with them, then later hate them again. I had the impression it was ultimately about me and my prejudices! I got pulled in from page 1 - typical of Rowling's stories.<br /><br />Can't wait for her next novel.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was a great read,but  I didn't like the ending. Amy was a crazy  almost  unbelievable character, a little too much.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I am hooked on Michael Connelly books. Can't wait for until he writes another one. Great author. His books keep me wanting more.
0451530926|1.0|I am a college freshmen. All I wanted to do was save some money on a textbook. Well, the shipment was due between two to three days. I checked before, during, and after those dates and it still never showed. While I was checking for it at my post office my account order had said it was delivered. When I contacted Amazon about the product over a chat window, it seemed very computer programmed. And they were not helpful at all. All they could do was give me a refund. That did not help because I needed this text for a class and an essay. I was unable to complete this essay in a formal college manner because I needed this text to write this essay. My parents have always used Amazon. Never had any problems. I will most likely visit Amazon again, but not for text books.<br />*So main things from my review;*<br />-Online customer service chat very computer programmed<br />~ And not at all helpful<br />-Don't buy important things on Amazon
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I did like this book. I also like how the author wrapped up all the storylines.  There was an explanation for everything, even details that I actually thought were trivial.  The only thing I was not crazy about was the touchy feelieness going on betweeen the characters.. the book would have been quite short if some of that was left out!  But I understand why it was there to build up to the climax...oops did I say that?..
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|Liam Neeson delivers again. Story's predictable, but well written. In spite of being typical, the movie keeps moving and keeps the viewer engaged. Of course, it's hard for a Neeson fan to find fault.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Was a very nice surprise and kept me engage through eachsection.  Clever & well written - 5*!<br /><br /> Looking forward to the next in the series!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wow! It just keeps getting better and better. If you haven't started the season yet, what are you waiting for!
B004132HZS|4.0|I enjoy the series but was disappointed there were so few programs per season. Nevertheless, they are well done mysteries.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I was waiting for awhile for the app store to use it but now it's s so awesome.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Really guys you should get it
B00633W614|4.0|I thought the ending was not has good as the first book.  Just a set up for the third book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Good game. Has a lot of good challenging games. Kids like it too. Glad I down loaded it.<br />It isn't like most games I have downloaded in the past where u have to buy the next level with real $$$$  . It has lots of games. Which is good. Cause I don't get bored with it.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Never heard of lifeproof cases before my wife bought her Iphone.  Saw an instore display and choked at the price.  Found it on Amazon for half the cost.  Watched the videos of how it works and knew it was good for my wife.  Has performed flawlessly.
0765325950|5.0|Wow!<br />Just finished reading all 14 books.<br />Wow!<br />It baffles me when people complain that a book didn't go the way THEY wanted it to go.<br />I don't do that. When I read a book I take a ride, and I accept wherever that ride takes me.<br />And what a ride!<br />Wow!<br />This book wore me out as I laughed, cried, and got stunned continuously. This book delivered on all levels.<br />I want to thank Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson for giving me something special, an experience like no other.<br />Absolutely spectacular!<br />Was it perfect? Gosh no!<br />There is no perfection to the turning of the Wheel!<br />But it was darn close.<br />Rest in peace Mr. Jordan. You have created something beyond spectacular.<br />May you find shade and water.<br />Thank you!<br />Wow!
B0030IG0C6|5.0|Very pretty and my daughter loves it!  High quality and priced right.  I panicked when I nearly knocked it off the counter and then remembered it wasn't porcelain...because it really does look like it!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I reviewed Season One, which was engaging and witty.  Same for Season Two. I'm completely hooked.  Love the writing, and the relationship between Harvey and Mike.  Lewis is a hoot.  Great characters. I couldn't wait for the second half of Season Two to come out.  Love this show.
0060899190|5.0|There is something addictive about reading other people's secrets. Once I picked this book up, I couldn't put it down. My only criticism is that whoever packged the book, overdid it in the extreme. The book came in a very large box w/lots and lots of paper. Too much fuss for a book, I think.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This app is better than a flashlight.  The option of HD and LED is very convenient.  I also love the HD color wheel options.  They come in handy for photography and viewing animals when we go for night time walks at the zoo.  The animals don't get disturbed when using the red shades of light.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Very easy to play this on my kindle fire hd! I challenge myself to beat each level before 5 minutes. I love playing this before bed and I'm addicted!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who is a Michael Connelly fan. I am a fan. I like his Harry B. stories
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love challenging games that make me think. this is the perfect game for me. I could play for hours trying to solve every level!
B0093FNZT6|4.0|I found this book very challenging.. It made me wish to explore subject further. The fact that author is a neurosurgeon made Proof of Heaven more than just a great read
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Got this because it was a free app of the day, and I'm addicted! Definitely worth paying for and have a already recommended to friends. A must buy if you like using your brain!
B007THA4FI|5.0|this is way better than tha cursed jaer hell harry potter.

0439023491|5.0|Damn. Damn. Damn. Why didn't I read Catching Fire sooner? I did. Two years ago. But then I stopped after reading the first 5 chapters (I think) because the pacing was just slow for me. I'm glad that I picked it up again though. I. LOVE. IT. There's way more suspense, actions, and Katniss-Peeta moments. I love it more than the first book which is good because it would suck if the first book is better than the second. It means the story is improving! Also, I love the love triangle in this trilogy. It just flows so well.<br /><br />Catching Fire is divided up into three parts. You know what's cool? Every time you turn the page, it got better and better. The first part was kind of slow for me. Maybe because there wasn't that much action taking place. But man! When you get to the next two parts, there's a bunch of twist that will leave you at the edge of your seat. Literally. There's also a lot of creepy parts especially in the third part. I was reading this before I slept and it just totally freaked me out. I really hope the movie turns out really well.<br /><br />I don't know what else to say. This book left me speechless, sad, scared, happy, and I even highlighted my book because there were a lot of good quotes! I hate writing/highlighting in my books by the way. I read it in 3 days, stayed up till one in the morning. I swear you'll get obsessed with it, and BEFORE you read it, make sure you get a copy of Mockingjay because after you read this book, you'll want to jump on that one right away.
B000GHTFIA|5.0|I wanted to re-read The Stone Bull. I barely remember it except that I really liked it. It arrived on schedule and is in great condition. Thank you!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is the best and most realistic horse game I have ever played!!! I give it 10 stars out of 5! I wish all animal games were as realistic as this
B001GKJ2DY|4.0|Wow! I had seen this movie once before and remembered that it was pretty funny. MOSTLY I remembered when a particular star up and started singing! I nearly rolled on the floor laughing.<br /><br />In watching it again, I was disappointed ONLY that there was more R rated moments than I'd remembered. I just can't let my kid watch it I guess. The movie was still funny. If you like comedy and don't mind the musical format, you'll get a kick out of this one.<br /><br />It arrived when it was supposed to and is in great shape! Thank you.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Especially enjoyed the way Tina Fey tells jokes about her personal life events.  The funniest to me was the teen age haircut.  Very good
B0046B1KHG|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS SO FUNNY!!! MY SON AND I WATCHED THIS OVER AND OVER!! IT MAKES YOU FEEL WARM AND FUZZY ON THE INSIDE. AND IT ALSO MAKES YOU HAVE &#34;HAPPY TEARS&#34;!!! RECOMMEND THIS TO ANY AND EVERYONE!!!
B000OVLBFS|5.0|Great Jesse Stone. He ties up several continuing personalities in the series.  Tom Selleck,please continue with the rest of the Robert Parker novels about Jesse Stone.
0765325950|5.0|The silly people who gave the book one star just because it did not come out in e-book have ruined it for others who will think it not worth spending the money to buy a fantastic book that would lead them to want to read the whole series. Shame on them. The book, despite the author's demise, is well worth investing in both paperback and e-book for your library.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|The movie was a bit pixelated for $3.99. Kind of frustrating. Very good movie. It also froze up and had to reload once.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great time waster especially for being free. addictive little games too. I don't understand all the bad reviews. it says straight out what it is and isn't. you have no right to complain about anything given to you at no cost!
B005LAIHZY|1.0|One of those movies you should rent at redbox. The graphics are cool but it failed to keep kids interested in the movie and really has no target audience. save your money for the red box.
B00B19DMUE|4.0|It's been awhile since we've seen a decent scary movie.  This one was pretty good.  The ending wrapped it all up a little too neatly and quickly, but other than than, pretty good.  No sexual content, so it was ok to watch with our teenage sons too.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Not even saying my age (hah!)....but found this puzzle is a clever idea, can be a great stress reliever or distraction and could easily pass for an adult 'executive toy' as well as a kids toy.  Enjoyed navigating the ball through a pretty creative array of different obstacles.  Like that there are many starting points further down the line in case you just want to try something, or blow it and don't want to start all over again.<br /><br />Why is it that only kids are ever allowed to have any fun?  Great for giving you a little mental stimulation, challenging and long playing enough to keep you at it but not so difficult/impossible that you abandon it in frustration.<br /><br />My only complaints were the ball does get stuck pretty fast occasionally if it rolls freely(not enough clearance with the shell) and of course the usual a-bit-too-cheaply made-in-China materials.  The included stand for instance is more like a piece of cellophane/joke, and mine bought by mail had a few scratches which kinda get in the way of seeing a bit :( but not a big deal, all in all this is a pretty cool puzzle.<br /><br />------<br />(PS)- I eventually looked at all of these just out of curiosity (original, twist, rookie etc) if you are getting this for an adult, definitely get the Epic.  Its the best one hands down.<br />Probably, not for small kids though I don't see them having the patience for it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I chose this book because it was in the bestseller list.  It certainly kept me interested and guessing what the next plot turn would be.  The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the language and some of the violent sexual scenes...but I do realize that was part of the story.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|While the first book was very interesting, difficult to stop reading it, this one fell deep into basic plots / love stories and ridiculous coincidences to keep the story going.<br />I had to jump compete sections and later on just could not keep reading it, I became bored.
B008220D5K|5.0|To make a very long story short, I do not make a habit out of buying movies PERIOD.  With that said. I am buying three of This is 40.  This is my favorite movie of the year.  If you are easily offended by strong language you may want to reconsider.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|Nicely written, paces excellent through the different ages, lovely descriptions of places, people and their feelings.<br />A good read if you wan't to travel to other times, relax and enjoy a good novel.
B002VWNIDG|5.0|Yes, it is starting to show it's age, after all it has been 30+ years since it was originally made.  However, I would put it up against any modern horror films.  Jack Nicholson is amazing.  A great movie.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I just enjoyed it like happy endings Like in waking up married you know the plot but it takes your mind off every little thing and relaxes you
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Review on my blog, The Reader's Commute:<br /><br />At my aunt's suggestion, and courtesy of NetGalley, I got to read Me Before You by Jojo Moyes.<br /><br />Readers: I'm so, so glad that I did.  Before I get ahead of myself, here's the synopsis for this book (courtesy of Amazon), which came out December 31, 2012:<br /><br />Louisa Clark is an ordinary girl living an exceedingly ordinary life--steady boyfriend, close family--who has never been farther afield than their tiny village. She takes a badly needed job working for ex-Master of the Universe Will Traynor, who is wheelchair bound after an accident. Will has always lived a huge life--big deals, extreme sports, worldwide travel--and now he's pretty sure he cannot live the way he is.<br /><br />Will is acerbic, moody, bossy--but Lou refuses to treat him with kid gloves, and soon his happiness means more to her than she expected. When she learns that Will has shocking plans of his own, she sets out to show him that life is still worth living.<br /><br />A Love Story for this generation, Me Before You brings to life two people who couldn't have less in common--a heartbreakingly romantic novel that asks, What do you do when making the person you love happy also means breaking your own heart?<br /><br />Moyes' writing is breezy and easy to read.  The downside is this: I finished this book much faster than I would have liked!  Although, I had the sense to stop reading in public when I realized I was going to start sobbing uncontrollably.<br /><br />(Commuters: You may not want to read this on the train, if you're an emotional person like me.)<br /><br />The majority of the book's narration is through the POV of Louisa Clark.  She is chatty, and pleasant, and incredibly comfortable in her hometown.  When she loses her job at a cafe and interviews for a caretaker position, she gets a real wake-up call.<br /><br />She becomes a companion for Will, a thirty-something quadriplegic who, before his accident, was a high-powered businessman with a taste for adventure.  Wheelchair-bound and entirely dependent on others, Will is a shadow of his former self.  Louisa soon learns that her position in Will's life holds a weight that she may not be prepared for.<br /><br />There are other POV chapters scattered throughout the book (Will's mother and father, Will's medical caretaker, and Lou's sister).  However, I was saddened to not see any real insight into Will's POV.  Surely, in a book where Will is just as much of a main focus as Louisa, there should be some of his side to the story?<br /><br />This is only a minor issue, in my opinion.  I felt as if I learned enough about Will's character through his interactions with the people around him.  His letter to Louisa became the ultimate definition of his character, and I love him so much for that.<br /><br />This is a beautiful, heartbreaking book.  It's painful, but inspiring, and life-affirming.  I finished reading it a few days ago but have been unable to form the right words to review it.  I hope this begins to do it justice.<br /><br />If you're looking for a book to make you laugh, and cry, and want to get out there and live: read Me Before You.  It will not disappoint.
B004JHY8A8|3.0|I enjoyed reading Sarah's Key until the last few chapters. I felt it started out as an European film and finished as a B grade Hollywood film. Pity really as the ingredients were there but just needed a more subtle ending.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved \\"Slammed\\" and \\"Point of Retreat\\" but did not expect Hoover's third novel to be even better. WOW. Great story line, wonderful character development..... my only disappointment was that she doesn't have any more books out for me to read.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Scary surprises, interesting puzzles and a good story with really great animation.  I hope to play more games this good.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I literally read all three of Colleen Hoover's books in less than 2 days. I just could not put them down! This made me laugh, cry, and smile in utter content. I fell in love with her characters and very much enjoyed the ride.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I had this game for the old Haven't back when I was 10. I'm 38 now and it still brings that same excitement as it did back then. Awesome buy!
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|I love this cd, Pour it Out and LOVEEEE are my 2 favorite song, I enjoy purchasing cd that has more than 7 good songs. A great but for 9.99
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Michael Connelly writes another thrilling Harry Bosch story that connects the whole family. Bosch as lead detective, half-brother Mickey Haller as lead prosecutor, Haller's ex-wife, Maggie McFierce as co-council and even the daughters  Maddie and Haley who meet for the first time. Jessup is found guilty in the eyes of the reader and before a verdict is rendered, kills his attorney and defense team and is brought down by the police SIS squad tying up all the loose ends. Another success for all, especially Michael Connelly.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|My daughter and wife love the Twilight movies as most women do. If you follow the series you will enjoy this one as well.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I enjoyed this game. It wasn't boring or too easy like most games. I am ready to download part 2. Great game!
B005UBNL0A|5.0|I am a system builder and this FX 4100 is a really nice performing CPU. I just built a system and it runs better than mine! I am going to hate to see it go out the door.
B004EBT5CU|3.0|This CD is ok. I only knew a couple of the songs that I liked.  The songs seem to all sound the same.
B003F9G8B8|4.0|Excellent film! Does a wonderful job bringing light to the history of apartheid in South Africa. Truly inspiring upon viewing.
B003QS9WIE|5.0|This film was very well done! Suspenseful and enthralling. The story line captures the viewer for the entire length of the film.
B0013FXWU6|3.0|It was in a cheapo box and all scratched up.  Lame to say the least.  I ended up buying a better looking copy from another site.
B00992CF6W|5.0|IT IS SO AWSOME IT  My breath<br />ME AWAY<br />MINECRAFT IS SO AWSOME glad they made this game<br />Thank you minecraft
B009K0P10K|5.0|Just a great and entertaining show. Has intrigue, witty dialogue, strong and diverse characters, excellent acting, sex, politics,<br />love, and action--what more could you want from a TV show?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game I've been lookin g for a great horse game and normal y I'm very picky but t hi as game is th we best!!
B007UXSPK2|5.0|this is another excellent action packed movie. the whole family watch it not once but three times because of it`s action packed adventure.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Cut my rope is fun and awesome!!! But mostly what I like is that little green guy, &quot;Om nom nom&quot;. Also it unlocks videos that you get from YouTube. The favorite levels I like is the d.j and the ghost one. Right now I finished all the levels but still waiting for the next new ones. I hope that they come soon. But you should get this game it is the boom!!! I know that the little guy misses you right now because he wants you to feed him and he's starving!! You know what, I'm going to feed him right now. Hope you like my review!!! This game is #1!!!<br />:)
B009A87ZQU|5.0|When I first saw this movie I found I was back into Bond again.  Sure I liked Goldeneye mainly because I was playing the game at the time, but all that movie aside this gets Bond back on the right track.  What a great direction to take the character and it's even better on Blu-Ray.  If you're a fan of Bond and have yet to delve in Daniel Craig do yourself a favor get started!
B001Q9J4PG|4.0|I am 30 percent into this book, where is Jack Ryan? I like the book, typical Tom Clancy, very good.<br />Four stars
B004WY2M8I|5.0|I've been wanting to read these boos for sometime, after returning from a vacation to New Orleans I was finally motivated to read them. I love a good vampire novel and this series so far has been the best! I think my next read will be more of the follow ups to this set of three and also the new graphic novel, Claudia s story.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app . This app is so helpful when I know my battery is dead but this app tells me how much battery I have left .so I recommend any one to get this app'<br />:)<br />I hope you download this app it's really great .
B004YM6JI2|5.0|My grand daughter follows the supernatural season and requested this for a Christmas present. She was very pleased with it. Price was very good and was delivered very quickly
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This is super stupid. There is no point in using this. My mom can tell me everything this knows dictionary knows...
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I just started playing. I like it so far, its good quality, User friendly. I like the horse feeding, grooming, and riding.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I was overly happy about how this book changed my life. Nicholas Sparks really knows how to get his words to mean something in your own life. If you enjoy a love story with an incredibly heart pounding twist, you absolutely must read this novel.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't get enough of this show.  It seems forever before I can see the next episode. Love it, love it !!!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I liked the story- it was very different from the other thriller mystery books I have read!<br />Keeps your interest all along
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book blew me away. I hadn't expected much because what would be great about a book told be the dog. But wow.
B00917IQFY|5.0|Actually, more like 4+ stars, but the album and Graham Parker (and the Rumour) are so deserving of more attention, a little hype is deserved. The musicianship is impeccable, the lyrics intelligent, and most all of the songs are extraordinarily appealing.  The CD has in been replay mode since it arrived,  Yes, there are a couple of throw-aways, but only in the sense that I don't find myself singing along.  Every cut is eminently listenable.
B0051MKMNC|4.0|I have watched this a few times and always enjoy  it.<br />Who wouldn't want to be smarter, faster, a rapid genius?<br /><br />Good interaction between the characters, keeps you nervous about how things will turn out....
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|Great little addition to the movie. All the great mixes and all the fun songs. Sing it and be it.
B009DT98RK|5.0|It's great to listen to and watch.  Frampton is skillful and enthusiastic in his approach and shares his love of music.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The best book ever but sad it was super amazing I can't wait a couple more years till the movie
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was a page turner.  I could NOT stop reading it!!!  I would read it on the stairmaster at the gym and the workout would fly:)
B009POCG5Y|5.0|If you like Clint Eastwood Movies, then you'll love &#34;Trouble With the Curve&#34;.<br />Clint Eastwood takes everyday living, aging, and struggle with family coupled with<br />scouting rising baseball players into a fantastic movie.<br />Definetly worth seeing
B005LAIGSM|3.0|The case came cracked, which was not mentioned.  Slightly disappointed with my purchase.  I have not watched the movie yet, but I am hoping it plays ok.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We are now addicted to Downtom Abbey....the question is, what will we do when it is over?  I highly recommend.
B0074AGVWK|5.0|I really enjoyed this , she has been one of my favourite authors for many , many years and this is up there with her best
3551354014|4.0|This is a great read for German students who want to do something to increase their vocabulary in a fun way.  Most of us have already read this classic in English and know the story well, so it is a perfect read for those who are working on their German language skills.
B0045EJY90|3.0|i believe in quality products but i will give this away for a present and continue to use my 1990 philips cd-40 player. the DAC chip makes the philips cd player sound so impressive. and of course back then the quality was so much better. i should of known not to buy a new cd player.
B00AYQNOU8|5.0|Great film I used in a course I teach at rutgers university. Beautiful, stunning imagery in the style of Bataka, koyanisquatsi, and other wordless documentaries (our daily bread also comes to mind), definitely worth viewing but was even more amazing in movie theater in 70 mm format.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Fun, entertaining game, & very addictive. Graphics are very good. Like the different choices of the jetpack from the stash
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun game. nothing too exciting but rather fun. suppose to rate the game to get three gems so yup. just wanted the gems
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I like to read it when it is Christmas and  Christmas eve  before me  and my family go to bed.
B002WN35DC|1.0|Please note that this review is on the Kindle version,  NOT the original book itself.  Like others have mentioned the are no drawings in this book. I believe the drawings are a huge part of what makes this story so splendid and it's incredibly unfortunate that they were not included in this edition.  I almost wanted to request my money back after my disappointment.  Very sad.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is so far the best book I have read. I would recommend this book to everyone. Can't wait to see the movies.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This app is the best one I ever tried . They have the most coolest editorial parts . I can make collages of my family ! It's an awesome app to use !
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The funniest book ever!!! I love how they draw the characters!!! I would recommend this book to kids 8 Years and older!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is amazing couldn't put it down. A must read ...put it on your list of books to read
B009IJJB8G|4.0|&#34;Do you believe in love at first sight?&#34; This the question. There should be no suprises concerning his sentiments toward Holmes.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|If you go into this expecting to see an action movie then you'll be disappointed. I didn't know what to expect, so I really enjoyed this movie. I really felt like I could connect with the characters, and it was good seeing actors play a different role that they usually aren't in. Tom Hardy and Shia Lebouf(sp?) did fantastic in my opinion. I finished this wanting more of the story, and was sad when it ended. Its strange because not alot happens in the movie, yet it seems to work, possibly because its a true story. Don't take my word for it just watch it.
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|I've been looking for a way to stream YouTube videos and saw this app under Free App Of The Day. Easy to use. I don't have a Wi-Fi TV but it works great with the Xbox. It detected the stream from my Kindle Fire almost immediately and streamed trouble free. The quality is only as good as the original source video. Well done!
B00AC8ZJPQ|2.0|Stupid movie. I understand that it was low budget, but come on. It's plot is so blah. If you're a halo fanboy you may get a thrill but for the other 99% of human beings, you will not like this piece of crap. Dont charge so much for what's basically a YouTube video and maybe my rating would be better. Do not waste your life on this.
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|i really think the developers should have put in the description what kinds of tv you can use with this app. obviously just any old tv won't work. i have a roku so i was hoping this app would work with that, but it doesn't.<br /><br />however, it works just fine on my kindle fire and that's good enough for me - since i got it as the FAOTD. if i had paid for this expecting it to work with my non-smart tv, i'd have been sorely disappointed. but it's nice to have all the content available on my kindle. there is quite a selection of things to watch, plus it will play any videos i have on my device.<br /><br />i skipped the facebook login, but i might use it at some point so that i can watch my facebook videos. it's not a big deal since i can set it so that &quot;only me&quot; can view this app's posts - the last thing i would want to do is announce to everyone on fb that i have nothing better to do than watch tv! or especially have everyone know exactly what i am watching. thankfully it's easy to set it up to preserve my privacy.<br /><br />the videos aggregated by this app look great in HD on my kindle fire, and they play without glitches. i don't know what else to say about this app. it does what it's supposed to do, and i think it would be worth the $5 for someone who has the right kind of tv or xbox or whatever. i subtracted one star because it doesn't work with roku and there's nothing about that in the description.<br /><br />as for all the vitriol in some other reviews, i think people should probably examine the app a bit more before having an uninformed hissyfit in their reviews.
B003R0MEZ4|2.0|Two disks had bad skips. I have bought previous seasons from Amazon and received better quality. This one was of poor quality.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Loved the History and &#34;my favorite things&#34; music box + the DVD's and the Musical score.I recommend it highly- Great!!
B0055S348W|1.0|I bought it and if it worked would be worth it. However I have an Epson expression xp400 and it tells you to choose manually. The expression printer is not available to choose. I hope to get a refund if I cannot get it to work. I will update later.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|But it never gets passed the buffering message. I thought it was going smoothly, found movies to watch, and phone photos, but nothing works.
B00936A0RU|5.0|The only negative I have about this movie is that it was hard to understand what was being said a few times. (just replay that section and turn the sound up), other than that, this is a classic movie. All the parts, seens and actors were fantastic. I loved it, had to watch it twice. Just didn't want it to end. Very well directed. 5 stars in my book.
B00AAQ7JNA|5.0|I buy a ton of products on Amazon, and rarely publish reviews...  but I had pre-ordered this on Blu-Ray long ago, because 1) I have a huge collection of live concert Blu-Rays and DVDs and buy most everything and 2) I was personally at this concert in London at the O2 (the December 20th show in 2011).  It was an incredible show and experience (I got to meet Rihanna herself in a meet and greet after the concert), and having a chance to have a professionally shot video of the full concert (mostly) is amazing.<br /><br />However, when I was expecting the Blu-Ray to be delivered, it wasn't...  I checked my order, and it was canceled because people complained to Amazon about the sound.  What the heck?  It took a full year for them to put this video out - could the sound be THAT BAD?  Well, I ordered it from Amazon from one of their marketplace sellers (so as a consequence didn't get to take advantage of my Amazon Prime subscription with shipping).<br /><br />In any event, all that aside, I have the Blu-Ray version of it now, I've watched it, and it is awesome.  If there weren't all these complaints about the sound, I honestly wouldn't have really given the quality of it much though - it is definitely no worse than the average sound quality of my hundreds of concert DVDs and Blu-Rays in my collection, and as another reviewer astutely pointed out, if you are accustomed to listening to MP3s, there is really no difference.  If you are an audiophile with a $10,000 audio system in your home, maybe it will leave you wanting more.  I have a $1,000 sound bar and $500 subwoofer and it sounds awesome to me.<br /><br />So if you are a fan of Rihanna, I'd say buy it, and if you hate the sound for some reason, Amazon has a pretty liberal return policy.<br /><br />The concert is awesome, and there are some nice behind the scenes bits cut in that are nice, and not the kind that are not very rewatchable like with some music concert videos - mostly short and backed with music.<br /><br />The main concert is cut together from the last set of shows at the O2 (obviously taking the best cuts from each show), and it is beautifully shot and nicely edited (thankfully not hyper cut MTV style like many are).<br /><br />One song missing from the product is Rihanna's cover of Prince's \\"Darling Niki\\", which I guess explains why my amateur shot version from the show that I put on YouTube gets a lot of hits.<br /><br />All in all, an amazing show in person and very thankfully to have this Blu-Ray of the same show to have to experience an awesome live show again and again at home.he main concert is cut together from the last set of shows at the O2 (obviously taking the best cuts from each show), and it is beautifully shot and nicely edited (thankfully not hyper cut MTV style like many are).<br /><br />One song missing from the product is Rihanna's cover of Prince's \\"Darling Niki\\", which I guess explains why my amateur shot version from the show that I put on YouTube gets a lot of hits.<br /><br />All in all, an amazing show in person and very thankfully to have this Blu-Ray of the same show to have to experience an awesome live show again and again at home.
B009MF5BXK|1.0|This is the dumbest movie I've ever seen. It had it all (good, big name actors, lots of action) except a competent director. The story line could have been a little better, but the director should be sued. Guess he’s just getting started in the profession.
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|I happened to be blessed to receive a screening copy to watch for the purposes of awards voting. The film is tense, suspenseful, moving. Indeed, it may be an inaccurate portrayal of the facts; however, I didn't have Time Magazine or the newspapers of 1979-1980 sitting in front of me while watching the film. In other words, historical inaccuracy was not on my hit-list to criticize. The acting ensemble that Ben Affleck has compiled for this film is quite wonderful. The two golden globe awards garnered (no pun intended ;-) by the film are well-deserved. It's a heavy-themed movie so get ready for it when you watch it. Well worth the time I would say.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|I got this thankfully for free today as I will explain below why I think this app is way overpriced at $4.99.<br /><br />I am just going to get to the point here.  This app will NOT work with any TVs that don't have any type of Internet connectivity unless you happen to have a box such as a standalone BluRay player or a media player such as a Roku or WDTV Live.  (IMPORTANT NOTE: I am not aware which if any of the media players such as Roku or WDTV Live even have the required internet app to make this work on a TV.  I am just assuming that some might.)<br /><br />Even if you have an Internet connectable TV or BluRay player with Internet apps installed on it, there is a good possibility like the Internet connectable HDTV I have which was just released a few years ago does NOT have the required DLNA, Allshare, or Airplay apps required to work on your HDTV.<br /><br />So in order to even use this on a TV you have to have one of the newer high end Internet HDTVs (or a newer media streaming box possibly if you have an older TV) and it has to have the DLNA, Allshare, or Airplay app installed on your TV or media type player.  So we are talking a small subset of an already small subset of the people out there.<br /><br />You CAN use this app to watch videos on your Android device.  But paying $4.99 for this app just to watch videos on YouTube or public domain cartoons and movies, or short little segments from websites like CNET which are available to view on cheaper and probably even some free apps for your Android devices makes little or no sense.<br /><br />I hope I explained the technological issues well enough here for the non-techies to understand.  For the reasons I have stated above, I have no choice but to give this only one star out of 5 especially when the app maker failed to mention that this app will only work on a small subsets of HDTVs in the description for this app.
B0086700CM|5.0|My friend has it on her I pod. waaaay better then the first one! but I cant find it for kindles. grrrrrrrrr!!! I have played it and its so fun and the characters r cheaper. only like 5000 coins. I think. ;-)
B0027BOL4G|5.0|The documentary was well done.  It gives the viewer an idea of what goes on inside of the food processing story.  It treats aspects that most would probably not think about.  It tells a story that we all eventually must hear.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the best game ever! I love playing this game. my high score is over 500000. because I play it so much! lol. I think u should buy this game
B009FXIICK|5.0|I love this game. It is a puzzle game so if that isn't your genre then this game isn't for you.  I love all the little animals and the boss is quite funny.

B008K9UZY4|4.0|Sense other sonic app's have come out this is the best classic one. people who sonic game just don't know a thing. To me the sonic app's are awesome!
B0090YHSFC|5.0|I have a pair of tablets for my girls and I am always for looking something to keep them busy when traveling.  This app has worked not only well, but have kept them busy and entertained.  I have tried it as well and have come to enjoy it.  Easy and fun app, even the music jingle is catchy.
0060833459|5.0|Excellent book! Very clear, in my case it helped me a lot to start mopving on in my proffesional career
B004DM0UII|5.0|I miss having my streaming on my phone and have not had it for a while due to always having issues and the apps not working right.  I decided to give another program a try and ran into XiiaLive; best thing ever!  Works great and never have any problems.  Thanks for the hard work guys and gals!
0887307280|4.0|It's a very practical book for understanding how to manage a company in a practical way without needing to be a be an mba degree
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I really wanted to give this book more than a 3 star rating. I would say it's 3.5. I read Bared to You and liked it, however, I had many questions. I thought that there would be some answers in Reflected in You but there just seems to be MORE questions.<br /><br />The whole book is so hot and cold and these characters are so passive aggressive with their feelings. I know a lot of people like Eva but I found her to be extremely weak. Sex is great and all but it seems that she can't resist Gideon even though he did some horrible things to her.<br /><br />We finally get a glimpse of Gideon's abuse but honestly, it only served to bring up more questions. I don't like authors who leave their readers with so many questions only to release another book that doesn't have the answers. I understand now why Gideon did some of the stuff he did but the way in which he went about it seems off.<br /><br />I hope the final (although Ms. Day may write a 4th book) answers all the questions. I don't want to give spoilers but I was extremely disappointed that not a lot of new information was presented in this book.
0060555661|5.0|One of the best books i've ever read. It helped me a lot in investing my savings and obtaining a decent return, without risk
B006X415GK|5.0|My niece loves this doll!  Looks exactly as pictured and the quality of the doll is very durable!  Thank you, Amazon!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I thought this was going to be a typial boy meets girl type of story but there was so much more and I really appreciate the way it was written.  I couldn't put the book down.  Great story line, felt so real and each chapter brought a new twist, I love that!  I love when I can't figure it out, til the end.
1607066017|5.0|Great first book, interesting storyline and great art. Reminds me of China Melville withs it imaginative creatures and world building.  Can't wait for the next one!
0525478817|5.0|A most excellent book and worthy of a 5 star rating. You almost can't put it down once you start reading.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|There are some wonderful ingredients in this story and the movie making is straightforward and professional but not inspired.  The direction seems robotic and formulaic over some good intentions.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Wow I really love your work Jeff Kinney. I want to be an author when I turn twelve this June. I really need some tips about becoming a Jr author. Maybe I'll have a best seller. Look out for me. If I do succeed I'll say Lunch.
0736092269|5.0|This book is awesome. It has great illustrations and explanations about which muscles are being worked. It includes a great library of exercises and also included tips for preventing injuries. This has been very helpful for learning anatomy. I'm using it to help prepare for my ACSM personal training certification exam. Highly recommend to anyone interested in anatomy and strength training.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This series is very similar to FSoG in all the best ways, with it's own twist. You will not be able to put this book down.
B0063IH60K|5.0|smooth, great colors, you can touch the cards & they fly; my favorite and so good for travelling or free time @ work
B00APUQJLO|1.0|I thought it might be good because of the characters. I was mistaken. couldnt even make it 20 minutes through this movie. All I saw was a guy in his limo talking to differnt people while they try to make him seem smart and mysterious and fail terribly. I was just so dissapointed I had to write a reveiw to give it a 1 star for wasting my money and time.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like this game b/c I can build houses &amp; collect things but I don't like the bad guys getting in my house!
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|It was ok not as good as the original. Ultimately I liked it, good action. Like to see sequel. Thanks.
B0071MQBX0|4.0|my daughter love Phantom but we were both disappointed with the music. First sound track is better. But its ok
B004HO6I2O|5.0|We've checked this out from the library so many times we had to buy it.  Yes, it's crude and hilarious.  The cast rocks and the writing is amazing.  Read the other reviews and they will tell you what you need to know.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is the best novel I've read in years.  I was being to think I'd developed ADD, since I couldn't stay focused while reading for enjoyment.  Now I think it was just the tired plots and cardboard characters in so many of the books published these days.  I immediately liked the hero in &#34;The Martian&#34; and cared about his fate.  He's funny, engaging and entirely human.  He's also extremely clever in a believable way.  The writing is riveting, without any of the violence, vulgar sex and cynicism in so many novels.  I'm not an engineer, but the science seemed to be quite accurate.  In short, this is a really good read.  Thank you for taking the time to write it, Mr. Weir.  And thank you Amazon for popularizing e-books so novels like this are published.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|I really have no idea why people think this movie was good. Definitely not deserving of a 77% rating on rotten tomatoes. Maybe a 20%?
B009YU62H2|2.0|Not that great of an album.  If you like one of the songs, purchase individually.  This was kind of a let down based on previous albums.
B004ZA9HB4|3.0|It works if you have a TV that connects to WiFi. My phone wouldn't recognize the TV  but my TV connected to the files on my phone. PrettyPretty cool app but it wouldn't read all of my files.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Rivio want money?well,If i payed 2-3 bucks, you have to own me 4 complete level.In hoth, it is say &#65378;coming soon&#65379;and i wated 3month? If you going to buy this,Idont care,but my thomb is down.But it is good game.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Finally I got NYC! it is way better then normal.Today i am about to get Tony and Liberty.I got this in Cristmas
B004I744AS|5.0|This is so much more than a dictionary. I have paid for apps that weren't as good as this one. It deserves more than the five stars I am allotted to give. Thanks!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I don't know why everyone is saying that this app doesn't work or whatever, on my Kindle Fire HD it works just fine. I love being able to go onto Facebook on my tablet! And unlike the app on my phone, I can actually look at pictures quickly!!!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Love NCIS.  Some episodes are better than others and that makes it a good show.  Love the characters and their charisma with each other.

B0090P98Z4|5.0|Okay so i have been playing for three weeks and have reached level 51 (highest) and i have a few points to touch.::::<br /><br />Alright first of all, this game is perfect for people like the money-collecting  and upgrading type of game.<br />2.This game NEEDS TO BE UPDATED! If you are a gamer or maybe even just a student that plays whenever convenient, know that this is perfect! If your like me who finishes everything, you'll be bored in around a week.<br /><br />3. (Tips) If you like gaining money, exp, and , items,, go with SHIVERING REFUGE LVL 10! I average tht level in 3 minutes, bringing me to a 560 gold average, and a 1/5 Rare Item every round!
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|I connected this with my Xbox with no problem. I had no problem skipping the Facebook login either. So I don't understand why there are such low ratings. Thanks for a great faotd.

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Easy to play, love it when I'm nervous and need to kill just a few minutes. Nicest part is it's free!
B006LSZECO|5.0|The book is good because it is suspenceful but in a horror story way. It is about what goes wronge in a relationship. People who like suspence. There wasn't anything i disliked.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|This will not open in wifi or 3g. I uninstalled and reinstalled and still nothing. I have a droid x.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I wont get long winded about this but I have to say this movie was amazing. All charachters had dimension, due in part to their solo movies, which really added to their interaction. You didnt have to waste time on people's back story and focus on what was at hand. So you had a nice pace of action but also substance. Great balance there. Just makes you look foward to the other Solo and next team Avengers movies! I hope Justice League will manage half as good as this. LOL.
B00A8SPNYW|3.0|This is a cute game with simple graphics but there are no instructions or helps.There are a few tap this button arrows but they dont tell you anything like tap and hold to jump etc. I got this as a free app of the day thing.Meh.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|This is Dredd the way he was meant to be. If any of you ever has read the comic you know what I mean. For those of you that have not read the comic then I suggest you do. The action was all amazing and was up to par with the world of Dredd. Karl Urban is a great Dredd, from mannerisms to dialogue. This wasn't meant to be an origin story but more a day in the life of a Street Judge and do you get a good idea. I love it. If a sequel is given the green light the creator did say he wanted it to be an origin story. Now who doesn't want to find out how Dredd became Dredd right? I hope it happens.
B005LAIHPE|4.0|This movie was better than I thought it would be. Liam's role was small. The scenes with the handicap guy, and the old navy ship is what made this movie surprisingly entertaining!!  :D I'm glad they didn't put those scenes in the trailer. I'd recommend this movie to anyone.  I didn't want to write too much as to give away the story line.
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|I loved the action as well as its homage to the first movie but in bigger scale. They are making a 6 and I hope it'll be great as well.
1401235417|5.0|My son loved this book! One of his favorite Christmas presents. Now need to get the rest in the series!
B001NLKXK2|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, it was well written, tender and incredibly sad at the same time. I highly recommend it.
B00008G8M4|5.0|We bought the DVD to replace a worn out VHS tape.  It is one of our favorite Saturday night films.
1250027624|5.0|This is more for those who wish to know the details of daily life at the time, less for those who<br />want more storyline. It mentions products and trends and cultural tidbits the characters may have experienced. We are treated to insights on the characters, however, for those who dislike \\"spoilers,\\" this doesn't ruin the series by giving away too much. Great illustrations as well.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game!!!! so fuuuun! I like how many different levels i has... starts out easy then gets challenging.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book is really good!!!!! I can say from experience that certain lifestyles in the book are indeed true to life! I've read some people refer to it as &#34;housewives porn&#34;, but I suppose those people have never experimented sexually. I will say that it's certainly not a Victorian era romance novel, but it is with the current age. The books are a must read before the movie is seen. You don't want to miss anything that may not be filmed or for ratings sake cut.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|I really liked this movie not because it pushes the tree hugging agenda...which it totally does.  The characters and the story line are very imaginative and overall i felt it shared good light on being responsible for our actions.
0307200477|4.0|My 19 month old daughter absolutely loves this book. Smelling the flowers is her favorite part. This is one of the only books that she will want to look at again and again.<br /><br />... Aside from the fact that the content of the book is great for kids, the binding sucks! The book pages detach from the cover sometimes by simply trying to turn the page. My daughter gets frustrated and asks me to fix it every time this happens. We ended up just having to hide the cover on her (which contain the first and last page) so that she didn't get annoyed every time she handles the book. This isn't just an occasional occurrence, the book falls apart every single time my daughter touches it, and having to reattach all of the little plastic rings is super annoying. I wish this book was bound like a normal book!
B009JBZH54|3.0|This set is ok, but it was originally selling for over $55, and I waited until I got it for $35 and I am glad I did. The movies are ok, but with all the different actors playing batman, it's hard to follow.
B00785P2QC|5.0|it is pretty cool and awesome and I will use up extra space...a a a a a<br /><br />I totally think it's a good game
0385484518|5.0|Would recommend to all, very easy read,  turn off the phone and read, I'd suggest shareing with a friend. enjoy
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm not much for watching Tv of any nature, but I'm here to tell you I have been totally enthralled with this program. It is entertaining, intriguing, without profanity or pornography. Compleatly great viewing !!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a fun and relaxing carnaval game! I would recommend this game for anyone wanting to enjoy a good game.
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|To me this movie was a huge let down. The stunts are sub par, course how do you top flipping a tractor trailer end over end.
B005TZFZ9W|4.0|The CD was used so I was ify. However it had NO scratches and played wonderful. The music was not bad either!
0743270754|5.0|Since the movie, Lincoln, was released and everyone seems to think it's a fab movie, this book was a good companion to the movie.  Bought it for my husband who is an American history buff and he is singing its praises.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a great game for all ages! Kids like me will love it. It is so fun and cool. As soon as I start playing this game, I can't stop! If you are in a sad mood and you start playing Angry Birds, I bet you you will feel better in no time.
B0090SI4HO|3.0|Arnold is back and gives it his best in this new film on quite a different take from the Schwarzenegger we have all known as we became mesmerized to the big screen. Although Arnold is not as young and funny as in True Lies, not as series as in Total Recall, and not as strong as in the Terminator, the Sheriff he portrays in this Western is still entertaining. His job as a cop on the Arizona-Mexican border is to protect his territory, while preventing crime. Trouble brews as he meets a no-good Cartel boss with something real bad up his sleeves, and Arnold has to put it to a stop. Sheriff Ray Owens must gather his crew, not fit for the job, and stop the Cartel boss from building a portable bridge in Mexico. Arnold must defend his border, but his helpers may need a lot of backup. The bullets go flying, the story-line bursts with exciting action, and fighting gets heated up as it sets off the flames for the final showdown. Overall, this film is entertaining, and acting is good. Highly recommended for Arnold Schwarzenegger fans, and those who enjoy Westerns!
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I know her intent was to wright about a love story but I believe this is more Sam's story.  I love Grace and Sam together but I like hearing about Sam's life as a wolf. Great read couldn't put it down already bought other two books.
B0090SI4FG|4.0|Billy was supposed to be one of New York's finest on NYPD. However, his career and his reputation crumble to pieces, after a shooting took place. Some time later as an ex-cop, Billy accepts an offer he cannot refuse, the money was too good. His mission is requested by the Mayor to find his wife's lover. Billy takes the case as a private detective, but gets involved too deep to turn back, after realizing he made a mistake accepting this job. He tries to keep clean as he finds the odds are more-and-more against him. Billy then decides that with his freedom and his life on the line, he has to come forward to reveal the truth in the city that never sleeps. Compelling story, acting is good, filled with suspense, and unstoppable action. The drama becomes as intense as the scandals, and cover-ups. Overall, interesting mystery that holds your attention. Highly recommended!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|A none`stop read<br />Breathtaking description<br />Truly a clash of kings<br />B b b b b b b b b b
B0091REZMW|3.0|this is a fun game but has a lot going on. this is another game where you need a lot of friends to advance. don't get me wrong,  its fun but sometimes frustrating.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This was the worst book ever sorry to who ever wrote     just writing like you i love my fire best thing
B003K1EYM6|4.0|This really works so great with the iPad. Except my camera a Sony, has a memory stick so it doesn't work with the SD card reader or at least I can't seem to work it.  But I am Not unhappy with the kit itself.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|IT WAS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR MY 9 Y.O. DAUGHTER.  SHE LOVES IT.  KIDS LOVE TAYLOR SWIFT.  LA LA LA
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I love this product. I can easily tell how much battery power I have left. It also tells me how much power and time I have for individual things like music.
B005LAIH2W|3.0|The movie was okay, but nowhere as good as the book.  If they had stuck to the story it would have been better.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|I can't stand all this iCrap and that iStuff.  Let's put it away and never use it again, OK?  Thanks!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I found the style of writing to be very easy to follow. I read the entire thing in a matter of days. Filled with great stories, deep insights, and a lot of interesting pieces of the story of Steve Jobs.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Puzzles keep changing to keeps things interesting. Good graphics. Interesting story to tie it together. Porbably ok for a younger audience.
0670451495|5.0|I bought this for my little nephew, so he can enjoy it as much as I did as a little one.  Awesome book and great value!
B009VA1FN6|3.0|Kate Morton is a real talent and the Secret Keeper is another great read.  She transports you into the story and the lives of her characters.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I loved these movies and was so excited when I saw that the trilogy came out.  A must purchase item!
0765325950|5.0|This book is everything I hoped it would be. I can't say enough good things about this book...it was the perfect end to an amazing series.
B004DES92U|3.0|Not a bad movie.  In all, I enjoyed it.  Not action packed, no big explosions :)  Not sure that I would classify it as a MUST SEE, but I don't regret watching it.
B009K916ZK|3.0|Have to play around with it for awhile to get it to work with my MacBook Pro 2010. Unplug, plug in, push hard, turn monitor off and on. It does work, but if I move the adapter in any way it easily looses signal.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|I watch this every year with my family, the  drawings and music are beautiful love that it has no words, none are needed
B009G8GRX6|5.0|This album is awesome!  This album is fresh.  Muse is awesome!  They are musical chameleons.  This album is well produced.  It starts with a bang and then slows to a symphonic pace.  The vocalist's voice is awesome and floats along and then in the same song wails like I have not heard since long hair metal singers.  No song sounds like another.  One song sounds reminiscent of George Michael, only modern; another like U2.  The next song will be totally different.  They sometimes sound like Queen.  The vocalist's voice is awesome and good enough to sound like Freddy Mercury.  If you like alternative music and want something fresh, I highly recommend this album.
B0063IH60K|5.0|No problem with ads so far: I only get ads for other games ..... I really like to play this game.<br />I have to correct this: there are also other ads now - hopefully it doesn't get worse!
B0053O89JM|5.0|Its packaged just like the previous seasons and does come with some extras to enjoy. The show wraps up quite nicely in the finale... I loved it
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is an awesome book. It's really funny. I recommend this book to all my friends. 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍
B004MC8CA2|3.0|Don't actually like the bible but this app will read the passages aloud which I do like when I'm trying to sleep. Plus the app is free
B001ASIRZG|5.0|This CD has an accompanying DVD with video. \\"Sight\\" is the DVD; \\"Sound\\" is the CD. Together this set has a large selection of a-ha music. The excellent concert was recorded live in Norway.
B0029O08WA|5.0|Twilight music has a sound of its own and this cd doesn't let you down. Every song is good, even those you don't really like at first listen seem to grow on you if you give them a chance. Highly recommend for any fan. Tho my first cd came to me with a broken case once it was re sent it was fine!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This is just a very entertaining and relaxing way to relieve stress.  Need to use some strategy, and a way to pass time when travelling or waiting on appointments.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Good for all ages! Tho it does definitely get harder the further you make it into the game. Very fun
B007ZLKKZM|5.0|So much info on George and the Beatles.  Love his journey!  What an awesome fella.  Wish I could have shared a conversation with him about finding peace.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Good app with lots of puzzles to complete. Try to ace every one! It keeps my mind active on a boring day or while watching tv.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I loved this movie despite it's numerous mixed reviews. I'm aware of but never read any of the novels or comics but overall I think this film nailed a lot of elements that seem to be sorely lacking in many of the newer & bigger 'tent pole' type of films. John Carter features wonderful characterization with a sweeping epic & action packed tale that brings to mind the magic & escapism of classics like Flash Gordon & Dune. A really great movie so don't believe the hype. Awesome film.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Easy app to use, makes connecting with my email super easy. Enjoy having the app ready and at my fingertips.
B001BZF9UY|5.0|I absolutely love this score.  This is the 3rd time I have bought it.  I got the CD to play on my Bose system in my Pontiac.  I bought the itunes copy to listen on my ipod.  I recently learned that the itunes version would not translate over to Winamp and my Galaxy Tab 2, because it had digital rights media on it.  So I purchased this copy from Amazon, and it now plays wherever I need it.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|If you need any white noise or the relaxing sound of a storm or wind or rain then this is the app for you! Very helpful to drown out the silence I can't drift off to sleep in
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It is a shame that it was ever cancelled. Well worth having in your home library. I recommend getting the movie Serenity to go with it. I did.<br /><br />Cowboys in space - really, what could be better!
B005FISC52|5.0|Its final installment... very happy with the ending... Packaging consistent with all previous seasons which is nice. Great show, love it!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love the game play constantly very addictive.  Actually I have gotten stuck on level 59.  Keep trying and I will accomplish it.
B00A757EFW|2.0|Didn't follow my finger well so I kept going the wrong way and running into walls and ghosts.. I deleted it after 2 games.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|just be sure to check setting if you eant it to ring Sat or Sun. it defaults to 5 days/week.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun for all ages the graphics are better then any other ive seen.  need to have more opportunities to get gems. all in all a fun game that anyone can master. thanks
0793563836|5.0|The CDs that come with this book are excellently produced, with the bass line brought forward just enough to hear, but not so much that the rest of the instruments are overshadowed. This allows the student to hear how the bass is integrated into the whole. I highly recommend this book!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Loved the graphics and the story line and really everything about this game! I have played a lot of these types of games and this is my favorite...now when is the sequel coming out!??
B000W7JWUA|4.0|My husband and I became addicted to this game when our friends bought it a year ago.  We decided to purchase it ourselves for a family get-together.  The game is so fun, but the quality of this version is not as high as our friends.  (not sure what version they bought)  Some of the city pieces are chipped/deformed.  And the board thickness is not as great as our friends.  But it still is an excellent game and i would recommend it to anyone.
B00913DPW2|3.0|Good but had to use walkthrough a lot which was disappointing...I don't like the super easy games, but this one was a little too difficult to enjoy, frustrated me more than anything else.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A great story in the tradition of other fantasies about women who walked out the door, disappeared, and hoped to make a statement. Great twists and an uncomfortable ending that's sure to make this book stand out in my memory. I liked the truthfulness about love, marriage, and long-term relationships. I liked the way the characters fought for power and the honesty about how nobody ever wins. I think the place as character was weak. Missouri is much more depressing and sinister than Flynn portrays. The local characters were one dimensional and briefly observed. They were not nearly diabolical and ignorant enough to ring true.
B007XHWROK|5.0|Bought this through Amazon as a Christmas gift, and their price couldn't be beat.  I actually bought it for my grade-school child, however, even my high-schoolers and college kid like it as well. My ultra-cool college son said that he didn't realize just how well Justin could sing and guesses he will have to stop making fun of him now.  That's saying a lot.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this book! I could not put it down. Couldn't wait to read The Mockingjay to find out how it all ends.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Very good book.  Enjoyed the detail and description of the characters and the life in those times.  It did make me cry.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Book one was by far better than the movie.  I read the whole set one right after the other and felt like I was a part of the action in the book.  I love books that pull me in and I am there with them.  These books had me in tears and filled with anger at times and was there cheering them on when they needed support.  They also kept you  wondering how it was going to end.  I loved the books and hope that any future movies portray this emotion in them, like the books do.
B006YTTVHO|1.0|I skimmed through this book, finding much of what the author said to be mere common sense. There was nothing in the content that made me feel enlightened, intrigued, or provoked to try a new communication approach.
0316228532|4.0|First off, I have never read a single Harry Potter book, nor seen any of the movies. When this book won on Greatreads in the fiction category, I thought I would give it a read.  I was also curious, about this book knowing that JK Rowlings was a terrific writer and this would be a very different style than Harry Potter.<br /><br />At first I was confused on the many different characters, which I thought was because I read late right before bedtime. I was relieved to find out others felt that way.  Fortunately on my Kindle I can word search and got quick clarity. Once I got into the book, I found it to be very good, the pace picked up and then I got so interested in all the crazy characters I couldn't wait to see what happened to each one of them.  I am so glad I hung in there and completed this book.  I enjoyed it very much. It was definitely worth reading.
B005LAIHPY|3.0|THE BLU-RAY IS GREAT, MOVIE IS A LITTLE OUT THERE. I DIDN'T THINK A BATTLE IN MORTH BALLS FOR YEARS COULD GO INTO BATTLE AND HAVE EVERYTHING WORK THE WAY THIS ONE DID
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I'm officially in love with Tina Fey. This book was smart, thought provoking yet also had me in stitches. Highly recommended  for anyone with an intelligent sense of humor.
B009MF56GC|3.0|I HAVE EXPENDFABLES 1 AND I COULDN'T WAIT FOR THIS ONE. IT IS AS GOOD OR BETTER THAN 1, LOTS OF ACTION. IT SHOULD OF COME WITH A DVD ALSO LIKE EVERY OTHER BLU-RAY I BOUGHT.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Great read. It really reminds you that we are all human after all and regardless of who we are there will always be ups and downs in life. Just gotta keep chugging along.
B0012GVKW8|4.0|SENCE I GOT A BLU-RAY PLAYER, IV'E BEEN GETTING BLU-RAYS FOR ALL THE MOVIES I LIKE. HOW I HAVE DVD'S AND BLU-RAY FOR THE SAME MOVIES BUT, BLU-RAY IS 100% BETTER.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|First heard them as an opener for Zac Brown... they were great in concert and the CD is just as good!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is by far the best way to read and study the Word. So many plans and versions so reading the bible cannot ever get old.
0307719774|5.0|The actual quality of the book itself is great! Very nice gold leafing on the page edges. The cover is thick and hefty. Binding is tight. The idea for the Q&A once a day for an entire five years is so cool! I had a hard time following through with it, but that's my shortcoming- not the book's! There isn't a huge amount of space for answers, so it requires concise, thoughtful responses. This would be cool to get for yourself to see how you change throughout five years. It would be great as a gift to someone close or even just an acquaintance! Would be great for a teenager with lots of thoughts and things to say. The idea is just so unique and thought provoking! Very awesome!
B000JQUZCI|5.0|Thanks for the quick service you are a good seller to deal with. The item came well packaged against damage.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the Best books I read in a long time.  I couldn't put it down read it in 3 days!!! I cry, I was mad, and felt in love with the story. Defiantly reading more books from this author
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|I have only had this app for an hour.  If I find I need to, I will downgrade it later.  Right now we are watching a slideshow of all those pictures I had on my phone for the last couple of years.  Having so much fun seeing them on the big screen.  Even though I may come back and update this later, I wanted to put this info out while it is FAOTD to add some info that might help somebody.  1.  Like other posters have said, you DO NOT have to log into Facebook.  I use FB, but not on my phone, so I'm not logged in.  2.  At first I could not get it to work.  The app said it couldn't find my Vizio smart tv, and from the TV I could see the Pantech Marauder phone, but could not select any pictures or video.  I was able to play one of the videos provided in the app, but I really wanted to see my own pics.  I even wrote to the support people (there is a nice contact us type section in the app), but in the next 5 minutes, I found the problem and wrote to ask them to close the support ticket.  All I had to do was restart my phone, and now everything shows up in the app.  So if you are having trouble, restart!  =====================================================  Update (1/23/2013):  I'm downgrading this from 5 to 4 stars.  I do love the ability to display my phone's pictures on my TV.  But when I wanted to show my husband some new pictures from a trip yesterday, it took me another 10-15 minutes to get the connection working again (not an easy process). I think the app-TV communication should be a little simpler. Unless it is more straightforward with some of the specifically listed compatible TV sets, I can imagine a lot of frustrated users, so I don't want to give it a false \\"glowing\\" review.    I had a little trouble deciding between 3 and 4 stars.  Here's how it ended up as 4.  I rated some different aspects of the app.  3 1/2 stars: The included videos are okay - nice to have them on the phone to kill some time.  5 stars: I love to show my phone pictures on the TV - and Ihave gotten this to work both days that I tried it.  2 stars: I strongly dislike how it is not a quick and easy connection.  3 stars (neutral): I couldn't get the 2 videos I took yesterday to display on the TV.  (I'm not placing a lot of weight on this, since it could be a compatibility or user issue.)    So my \\"average\\" is closer to 3 than 4, but I really do \\"like\\" this app. I'm just having some issues with it.  Since my Vizio is not specifically listed as \\"supported\\", I'll give the app the benefit of the doubt and assume it would work more smoothly with those televisions that are listed as supported.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Easy to navigate. Just like using on my computer. I've had no issues with this app and it keeps me connected great.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Fascinating story from the first page. This was my first experience with this author and I am eager to read more of his fiction. excellent character development and storyline. Highly recommend this to all !
0817439390|5.0|This is the 2nd photography book I read.  It really opened up my eyes to the possibilities hidden in the world around me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|pretty neat game. very life like and good graphics. it makes me think I have my old horse back. I would give it 5 stars
032147404X|5.0|This is the first book I read on photography.  It made me want to read more.  I have read 3 more Scott Kelby books and one that he co-wrote with Joe McNally.  I can't get enough!  I read these books before we went on vacation this past fall to the Canadian Rockies.  I got some really great shots, thanks to what I learned in these books.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND them to anyone wanting to learn more about photography.
B0090EIILU|5.0|My girlfriend and I thought this was hilarious. The main character is a sexist, inconsiderate bafoon that thinks only of himself. Need I say more?
0321544080|5.0|It has opened my eyes to all possibilities.  This is a great book, well worth the price.  This is a must-read for any aspiring photographer.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|This plot is a horrible mixture of Judge Dredd and New Jack City. Except Nino Brown is a skinny former prostitute. There is no real fear of the enemy, yet she somehow commands the respect of everyone in the room. The final boss battle was a joke and all she did was immediately die.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|A fitting story to bring this amazing artists special music to wider attention.  His music has been part of my life for well over 30 years and seeing his story unfolding in the excellent production still gave me shivers.  I have the Blu-Ray version and the quality and sound are excellent.  A fitting tribute.
B002PNF8HK|4.0|It may be because this videogame absolutely scared me as a child, but this was one of the scarier movies I have ever seen.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|My mother lives by herself far away from me & she gets lonely & like to watch things that make ya laugh. Seen this movie once & just thought she would like it & she Loves it!! Thank You, Dreama Graham
B00A757EFW|3.0|this  game is free because it is old. not because it's fun. this game is made in 1951.  how boring.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham entertains, brings words to life, and twists and turns a novel like no other.  He is always at the top of my list of authors when book shopping.
B005QKYIZ2|5.0|I love the songs that aren't on the radio.  Until I heard Spectrum, I never really liked Florence until I heard her on Pandora...very happy.
B005HNMPBM|5.0|Its smart, witty, brilliant, awesome, intelligent script that's philosophically driven, action packed 2hr's worth of excitement. The acting performances of Magneto and Professor X were impressive. I would watch this film again and recommend it to anyone.
B000055Y0X|5.0|How could anyone not like this movie?  Simultaneously hilarious and serious combined with wonderful acting, and a source of so many great quotes.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It is an amazon entertaining book, I tried it to test the immersion reading if ny kindle fire, and end up loving both the book and nArration :) recommended
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game is very impressive and the graphics are awesome! Totally worth the $. I cannot wait until part two comes out.
B005LAIHGI|5.0|My grandson is the one I bought it for and I have not heard any complaints.  I am assuming that he loved it.
1609611543|5.0|I am not a diet person, I have never dieted and this book isnt really a diet book.<br />However, this book was a gift to me, and then I purchased another copy as a gift for a family member.<br />Where this book will change your life, is how Dr Davis makes the link of eating wheat and the health issues that it causes.<br />I am not going to write a long review, but the book will definitely make you think twice about ever eating wheat again.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It brought me back to the day I first discovered James Patterson. I just couldn't put it down, in part because I was in shock and in part suspense!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I read this book in two days because it transported me back in time to being a teenager in high school where every conversation, every interaction, and every note passed in between classes meant something significant.  That's what I love about the main character - Charlie.  He noticed things and internalized things and didn't hit the reader over the head with things.  It was great to see life through those eyes again!<br /><br />I had mixed feelings of the protagonist throughout the book.  Sometimes I loved him, most of the times I felt irritated by him, and at times I empathized with him.  The story does at times hit us over the head with issues (ie. gays, rapes, sexual molestations, child abuse, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, abuse in general, family issues, racial issues, etc.) but thankfully it didn't overpower the story and make the reader feel that they were being lectured to.  At least I didn't feel that way.<br /><br />This book is for anyone looking to be reminded of simpler and more complicated times of being a teenager.  It is for anyone wanting to see things through \\"virgin\\" eyes again and be reminded of how new the world felt.  It was an easy and enjoyable read, and one that will stay with you for a long time to come.  Through its simplicity came a very insightful story that I am glad to have been a part of for a short while.

B000SEIK2S|4.0|I picked up Old Man's War because of the title and the great reviews on Amazon.  I picked up the 2 remaining novels in the trilogy because the first book is solid science fiction.  It was highly readable, the characters had depth and the alternate reality so important to sci-fi was consistent and believable.  It was an enjoyable read.<br /><br />I think the price is too high.  Yah, yah, I know all about Amazon pricing policies and publishers.  $24 bucks for the trilogy is too expensive for a data stream.  I read a lot and this will push me back to the local library.  I'm on a fixed income and I can't afford $100 a month for 12 novels.<br /><br />Other than pricing, I'd buy more of what John has written.  As it stands, I'm going to be walking to the library tomorrow.
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|boring ,after seeing the advertisement of the movie i said i have to read the books,iread the first one and i could have saved my money , in one word boooooring. it,s nothing like the guy in the movie. no action. no suspense, just dry reading. save your money if your an action hunter i hope his newer books are better

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is one of those books that will forever stay with you and it will move you unlike anything you’ve read before. It’s a gripping story of survival and love. This book is so incredibly heartbreaking and emotional that I know I will never be the same again. Some words that come to mind are hauntingly tragic but it’s also so incredibly beautiful…this is the kind of story that will make you hug someone when you are done reading it!<br /><br />Sometimes when a book is so over publicized with regards to it being AUH-MAZING…I always worry that I might be disappointed. This was not the case at all and you should absolutely believe the hype because yes, it’s that’s good!<br /><br />This book tackles two issues that are extremely dark and it’s handled in a way that gives them both the respect and attention they deserve. These topics are explained with dignity and courage. Not every author can do that and Colleen Hoover did so with the brilliance of her words.<br /><br />“Sometimes you have to choose between a bunch of wrong choices and no right ones. You just have to choose which wrong choice feels the least wrong.”<br /><br />I was emotionally invested in Sky from start to finish and her long-winded run-on sentences had me cracking-up! Sometimes I was even mortified at her complete candor but truthfully, I know so many us wish we could speak that freely! Sky is everything a heroine should be; she’s fierce, witty, loving, brave and forgiving and Holder is every bit as complex as Sky. He’s swoon worthy, he’s dark and is equally as broken as Sky but that’s what makes them work. There was not one thing that I didn’t like about Sky or Holder and their love story is sweet, innocent, exquisite and at times, even a bit desperate.<br /><br />I really thought I had this book figured out and I couldn’t have been any more wrong even if I tried! This book is beyond raw and I found myself doing the ugly-cry. When I say ugly-cry, I mean the most hideous form of crying possible! When I was done reading Hopeless I sat on my bed emotionally drained, loving what I just devoured and I was unable to think of anything else but Sky and Holder.<br /><br />“Let me inform you of something he says in a low voice. The moment my lips touch yours, it will be your first kiss. Because if you’ve never felt anything when someone’s kissed you, then no one’s ever really kissed you. Not the way I plan on kissing you. He drops his hands and keeps his eyes locked on mine while he backs up to the stove. He turns around to tend to the pasta like he didn’t just ruin me for any other guy for the rest of my life. I can’t feel my legs, so I do the only thing I can. I slide down the refrigerator until my butt meets the floor and I inhale.”<br /><br />My final two cents: My words are completely inadequate for such a breathtaking but beautiful book, so embrace this story because you will never be the same again.  ;)us form of crying possible!

B001HM1PFO|4.0|Homophobics and Bible thumpers need not bother.  If you have an open mind this is one the best musicals ever with some really infectious tunes you will likely find yourself humming or singing to for years.  Or maybe I just saw it in the theater too many times and am suffering from brain damage.
B005M2OIB8|5.0|This is a fine X-Men movie and a worthy prequel to the first two.  The acting is top-drawer and the story is exciting and well-told, if more \\"realistic\\" than the other X-Men movies -- due to its Cold War setting.  I recommend it if you enjoy the first two X-Men films, or other superhero pictures such as \\"Thor\\" or \\"Iron Man\\".
B0046IGOIO|5.0|This is not your typical Doors performance. Apparently Albert King opened and they were inspired. Morrison is in fine form and Albert sits in on several songs. Get it, you'll be glad you did
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I've noticed complaints from other customers that this Indiana Jones blu-ray collection houses the discs in cardboard sleeves.  That's true, and it is unfortunate, but for $40, I'm not complaining.  I'll leave it others to review the films and the blu-ray transfers, and will simply offer an easy solution to the cardboard sleeve dilemma:<br /><br />I'd already purchased the Indiana Jones DVD collection a few years ago (from which \\"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" is absent), so when this blu-ray collection arrived I simply took out the old DVD set, opened up each film's clamshell case one-by-one, and stuck a CD/DVD adhesive hub on the inside left of each case (you can get 100 of these fellows for $9 at Amazon, just search for \\"Clear CD Hub Center with Adhesive Backing\\").  With the hubs attached, I moved the DVDs from the clamshell hubs onto the new hubs on the left, then carefully slipped the blu-ray discs from their pesky cardboard sleeves and stuck them on the clamshell hubs.  \\"Crystal Skull\\" and the special feature discs are housed in the DVD special feature clamshell case, which is totally fine with me, since I don't like \\"Crystal Skull\\" anyway.  If one doesn't wish to purchase these adhesive hubs, one can buy clamshell cases that accommodate 4, 6, even 8 DVDs.<br /><br />It's better to light a candle than to curse the darkness -- or the cardboard sleeves!
0765325950|2.0|This series started out with a bang and was on its way to becoming one of the best epic fantasy series written.  I'm not sure what happened, but around volume six, Robert Jordan lost his way and began delivering books that did not advance the story and were little more than padding.  I stuck with the series hoping that Jordan would get back on track and once again create wondrous books like those of volumes one through five.  My hopes were dashed when Jordan died, but were resurrected when it was announced that Brandon Sanderson would finish the series.  Sanderson's first two volumes (12 and 13) were very good and even had some of the brilliance of the first five volumes.  I eagerly awaited the 14th (last) volume.  What can I say?  This volume is equal to the poorest that Jordan produced.  It is at least 600 pages too long, and is a chore to read.  I stuck with it to find out how everything ends, but at times it was like getting a root canal.  Too much time was spent on new or minor characters and battles, with far too little time devoted to Rand and the fight with the Dark One.  The dialog was stilted and the battles poorly described (for superb battle scenes, check out Joe Abercrombie's works) and they were unrealistic, even for fantasy.  New enemies appeared without any foundation and deus ex machina was rampant, especially on the side of evil.  What an absolute shame that a series that held so much promise should have ended so poorly.
B005URRCNQ|5.0|Expensive album but it was worth it! Came with the CD and black vinyl. Vinyl always sounds better and especially for this genre.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|good book always like fun reading and that keeps you interested.<br />would say that most people would enjoy this book.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Excellent program.  it provides you with a glimse of life in England after WWI and how the world started to change in a society which was so different than ours at that time.  It is also entertaining and well made.  You get to know each of the characters and understand them as human beings.

B002QE3CTY|5.0|I am currently almost finished with the 3rd book in this series, and I had to post my opinion.<br />This is a GREAT story and it is very well told. I think the 2nd book is the best by far, but the other 2 are obviously critical.<br />There are some of the best action sequences I've ever had the pleasure of reading. It is rare that I am able to get that caught in an action scene. Too many times writers get too detailed in the telling and you lose the flow of the action to the detail. Not with these books - I really felt like I was there, and a couple of times, was out of breath from the running!<br />I felt that the interaction though between the main character and females in the story were a little too... well, childish... but, that was all right because I could put in the context that it is a story about children anyway.<br />If you like stories similar to the Hunger Games, you will not be disappointed with these.<br />Enjoy!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I liked when peeta and katniss kissed a lot<br />Very thrilling when the wolf's killed cato<br />And when rue died from the spear and the boy died from katnisses bow and arrow

B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire was made easy to understand with a clear picture, but I never could understand how to exit.<br />I enjoyed the game and will play again.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Despite what the critics say about the writing style, I found the novel to be easy to read, funny in places and referencing a musical score that is varied and beautiful to listen to should you wish to purchase the soundtrack.<br />It is not as explicit as the media circus has made it out to be.  A little raunchy in places, the intent of the book is less about the sexual techniques, but rather about the maturity and outlook on life by the various characters.  If you want to read an adult love story that is written in the third person, then this is the book for you.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|Great album for a steal at 5.99! It downloads quickly and can be added to iTunes! The sound quality is perfect! I highly recommend!
B007KOYEOC|5.0|A great finish to the series and easy to read, with both characters having grown up and developed considerably from the first instalment of the story.<br /><br />At the conclusion of the book, there is an excerpt from the authors musing of Fifty Shades of Grey from Christian's perspective.  It would be wonderful to read the novels from his perspective!!  Sincerely hope that the author completes this project.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie was very entertaining and fun.  Highly recommend it.  It is more of a chick flick however.  good music!
B007KZY1YY|5.0|I found the emailing between the two main characters to be humorous and adding a unique dimension to the novel.<br />Easy to read, a continuation of the previous book, Fifty Shades of Grey, it clearly shows the development of the two characters maturity.<br />Again, don't let the media circus dissuade you from the novel.  The book is nowhere near as explicit as others in this genre are, focusing more on the character development that documenting sex for sexes sake.
B000FBJAF0|5.0|A great action adventure story.  Very well written with great character development.  I hope there are more novels to come with the Avenger.  He is a very believable, exciting hero who keeps one turning the pages.
0802130208|1.0|I can't rate this item as it was a gift for someone else and I'm not sure if the person it was given to has had an opportunity to read it, yet.

B0063IH60K|4.0|the only reason I didn't give this five stars is because sometimes the app won't work unless I turn the Internet on. I have had to reinstall the app a couple of times too. other then that it is great!<br />-
B003F48E4W|5.0|Had seen this movie before and I had really liked it. Lots of humor mixed with some horror.So I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that I could stream it for free with my Amazon Prime membership. I put it on my to watch list and had actually watched some of it.BUT.....when I came back to finish watching it a few days later (January 19,2013) it was no longer available for free Amazon Prime streaming but would have to be rented or bought if I was to finish watching it. Thanks Amazon. This will definitely make me think twice before renewing my subscription. BTW they did this on several others I had on my watch list and had not finished watching. Is there any purpose or logic to this, Amazon????? Definitely an excellent way to irritate and lose customers!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great app for children, it ail keep them busy until your devise dies! I would recommend you get this app for you, for your kids, for me- another child-! You will love this app.

B00AYB1RGG|1.0|I was disappointed with the acting.  The plot had nothing to do with the original, so no continuity. Just my opinion, it was a poor compliment to the first Dredd movie.

B00A9X9TIW|3.0|nice story line very original but main actor was trying to hard to be bruce willis.  did enjoy the story.
B005529EI2|5.0|The Lord of the Rings movie trillogy is one of the best movies to come from hollywood in a very long time -- the last time anything as good or close to as good was the original version of the Star Wars series (episodes 4, 5 and 6) before the re-edits messed it all up)<br /><br />Unlike other movies -- this extended edition was created specificly at the same time of the original theater release -- to tell more of the story -- infact, if you watch the theater release version you will not fully understand the full aspect to the story -- the elements that add to the extended edition is not a re-edit but the true original edit before it was cut down to satisfy the people who dont have the attention span to watch longer movies.<br /><br />If you prefer well done movies this is better, but you will never be able to go back to the original theater released version. You've been warned.
1401359418|1.0|This was really just another \\"Have a Good Attitude\\" book, maybe readers could convince themselves they are \\"lucky\\" even if they're not.  Author never touches on things such as having a \\"socially accepted\\" well connected family or the very obvious, having good looks, both of which have a huge impact on how your life goes and what is available to you. I'm ready to sell my copy back for whatever I can get.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|the book was just not long anuff. I did not want to put the book down!!!!!! keep it up Douglas and Preston
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love these types of games.  It wasn't too hard or too easy.  Really fun.  I only wish there were more levels!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Brings the story to a wonderful conclusion(?).  Full of excitement and erotica. Will wait with bated breath to read more if more if more is forthcoming.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|This is a very good game, It has quite a  lot of content for a reasonable price. I would recommend it for ages 10 and up as it gets pretty hard later on.
B007RTAR64|5.0|I got this as a Christmas gift for a friends daughter and she kept it in the box to collect.  It was nice and in great condition.
B008XX6J4C|2.0|Prior to purchase,I watched the videos on You-Tube and loved the great visuals and audio!  Got the CD and, well, the audio alone just does not stand up compared to the beautiful videos with music. It is almost elevator music if played quietly. This needs to be a DVD -- not a CD.
B000XGDO04|4.0|I bought the &#34;21&#34; CD first and absolutely love Adele's rich, deep voice and vocals.  I think her CD &#34;19&#34; has more of a jazz/blues feel to it and I can tell she has a younger sounding voice in this CD.  I still love this CD and believe that anyone who likes &#34;21&#34; will like this CD too.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|Works like a charm! Found my living room TV instantly and I played today's picnic photos for everybody at home. No, it doesn't require Facebook login, just press skip. Thank you for entertaining my family tonight, Bianor! Good job.
B00499QUK2|5.0|When I saw this was a 21st century take on my fave Sherlock Holmes stories, I was a huge skeptic. But after 15 minutes in, I was hooked. This is not another formulaic TV detective drama. The update does not feel strained or contrived. This is the real deal because of some wonderful writing, excellent editing, and superb acting and directing. This is heads and tails better than the poor attempt at a Sherlock update that is on American television right now (jan 2013)--not even in the same ballpark. All I can say is, More, More, More!
B008476HBM|5.0|A must read for all generations.  I had seen the movie but never read the book until now and wished I had sooner.
B004H1V5RU|2.0|The perplexus epic is a lot of fun and very challenging, but some of the tracks are impossible to pass because some pieces are ever so slightly out of place. It's very frustrating to get so far and then realize you can't finish it because it's broken! I can't open the ball to fix it so this game is useless.<br /><br />We have the perplexus original and it seems to be sturdier. No broken parts on that one, yet.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|This was one remake that was actually better than the first.  No only was the story line and acting better, but it was based in the real world (or a possibility of one).
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Never in a million years expected the ending. Sad and heartbreaking but strong and powerful!! Everyone should read Nicholas Sparks!
1476712042|5.0|I loved this.  I only wish it was it went on a bit longer.  It's the kind of book you you can't put down and fall in love with.  When it's done you want to start it all over again to see it play out again.
B005BY3XHC|4.0|Good to help one \\"find them self\\" or to keep on evolving. Follow the Law outlined in this book and your life is guaranteed to change for the better.
B002K0WBXW|1.0|it wouldn't work. there was no sound and it would stop and go. it would freeze and then start for a few minutes and then play
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Having seen the DVD and Bluray versions too many times to mention I was blown away with a fresh new appreciation of the terrific graphics. And like all other Avatarians I'm impatiently waiting for the sequel.
034580404X|3.0|Never read anything quite like it/them.  Maybe I'm naive??  Now I'm ready for a different shade . . .  red? pink?
B002FQOI0A|5.0|I love how the ending ties together and how romantic it can get! You should totally read When You Reach Me
B008133JZG|5.0|I usually don't write reviews, but I wholeheartedly recommend Sherlock for anyone who appreciates terrific writing and acting. It is clever and witty and gets better with each episode.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|groovy.  This adventure has nice graphics and sound.  Good length for the 2.99 price point.  Most puzzles cost more , so you will like this.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Although this has been one of my favorite authors for many years, I was getting rather tired of the same old theme and gore but decided to try this one anyway.  I was surprised by the new story line and had to stop and look at the cover a couple of times to remind myself I was reading Baldacci. Excellent work!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Good that it kept me entertained and it has a good twist.  But the characters are sadistic and all in all, I found it pretty depressing
B005WUHAX8|4.0|I've been through three Otterbox Defender cases over the past 4 or so years and now that I have a LifeProof case, I'll be hard pressed to go back.  This is a slim case with a surface that has just enough grip to it to keep it from sliding off a table or out of my hand, but not so much that it gets stuck in my pockets.  My only complaint is that you have to use an extender to use it with headphones.  This is not tragic.<br /><br />Edited after reading other comments:<br /><br />I highly recommend going through the product registration process on the LifeProof site.  This will verify your serial numbers (there are two different numbers) and protect your phone for a year in the event that the case fails.  It's important to watch the instructional videos to make sure it is properly put together.<br /><br />Also, this case is Barbie pink.  I do wish I'd just gotten a black one.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I literally couldn't put this book down.  I actually missed my train stop because I was so immersed in it.  I felt these characters and the story is so good and powerful.  I highly recommend it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story sucked me in from the first page and I couldn't put it down.  A must read for anyone that loves a good romance novel.
0547848412|5.0|This is one of those books when you finish reading, you realize you need to take a breath. The words I could use to describe how it made me feel, amazing, inspiring, imaginative, emotional, heroic, and more. There were so many wonderful moments in this book.... a couple times my throat clenched and the tears flowed. I laughed out loud. I cheered and I shouted for and against. It raised everything it could in me.<br />And I am so glad this is not someones' real life story. That would be the utmost tragic thing to conceive. But for a story, this will be the one to beat for my favorite of the year. Man, I wish I read this sooner, but I've read it, and now can see the film. I hope it's half as good.
0307888908|3.0|Many beginning chapters are inspiring as well as having good advice for a career. After that, it's a lengthy explanation of how relationship work in business and how everybody should be connected through a professional network in which Linkedin was dominating. A little bit of a sale pitch but overall it's an okay book.
B000JML7EC|1.0|Not very interesting. It was confusing with sailor slang words and British spelling. I would not recommend this book to people who like action.
1476704163|5.0|love it<br />ke$ha is amazing and her book also is amazing and her cd (warrior) also is amazing love it
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|Great! I was waiting for ages to get a Seamless way to stream video to my tv. Thank you, guys.

B00999DFP0|5.0|I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas.  She claims it's the greatest gift I've given her thus far.  She watches it all the time and the show is really good.  She's even got me hooked on it.  If you love this show, it's a must buy.  The bundle came sooner than expected, which is really nice.  The product was in tip top shape.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This tale of the unlikely survival and rescue of a marooned astronaut includes desperation, ingenuity, persistence, red-blooded American humor and language.  An imaginative story, but the text is marred by frequent typos and dropped pronouns and prepositions.  What's with that?  Is that why it only costs a dollar?  I enjoyed it!
B004QL7K70|5.0|Bought this as a Christmas gift for my adult nieces and nephews. They really enjoyed it! DVD quality perfect. Thanks
B00122OTZC|5.0|The sounds of these these giants of different popular genres seems to me even more interesting than their individual performances, aIbiet I love their to listen to each of them individually.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|A must-read for everyone.  Frankl's observations and theories apply to today's society so accurately it's almost scary.  Each person's search for meaning in his/her life is a different journey and Frankl has a deep understanding of our human fears and desires.  This book will make you think and maybe even change your life.  I'm going to read it again as there's a lot to absorb.  I got hung up on some of the technical/psychological jargon but it wasn't that hard to grasp the basic meanings.
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|I'm not sure why people are claiming it requires you to login to Facebook.  there is a clear option that allows you to SKIP the FB login.<br />This app works great with my 2011 Samsung PND59800 TV.  I would imagine most TVs that are DLNA capable, would be recognized.<br />In order for your TV to be recognized, ensure that your phone and TV are connected to the same wireless network at home.  So if you don't have a wifi capable tv, this won't work.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I can honestly say that G5 games have surpassed Big Fish when it comes to games for my Kindle. Graphics were great, puzzles just challenging enough to keep me from using the skip button.<br />Keep up the good work and keep them coming!!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I used to run, but was never a distance runner. Never-the-less I loved this book. There was a lot of name dropping of famour ultra marathoners that was lost on me, but the book was very interesting and I really liked the anthropology angle. I have recommended it to a number of friends.
B009G3T01M|5.0|I haven't stopped listening to this album since I bought it. The songs are so full of passion and brilliant storytelling that it never ceases to amaze me. I would be highly surprised to find someone who is disappointed with this purchase.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|it's a great game to play on ur tablet. I really love it better than any other game lol I could play this for hours. forevermore!
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|Without smart tv, I connect with my ps3 and works good, you can skip Facebook if you don't want to use it, but still nice option if you want all your Facebook content; then you have a lot of videos to watch with all those channels; I don't used to play much YouTube on the my ps3 because I hate the searching, now I search on my phone and see it on my ps3; for me is a pretty good app, the app can't find my ps3 I have to go to my ps3 and find my phone, I hope they can work a more easy way to work with game consoles, unless I'm doing something wrong, however it's a nice app especially if you get as free app of the day :0)
B009U9S6FI|5.0|This book is life changing. I found my meaning reading this. To go through the horror of the holocaust and be able to explain how is mind boggling, This is a must read for everyone to learn to see how important it is to live life and always have courage and hope in everything you do and go through. There is so much to learn from what he teaches. You will never think or act the same way again.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|THIS GAME WILL KEEP YOU BUSY BUILDING A BASE CAMP.HELPING YOUR ALLIES.DEFEATING THE ENEMY.TRY TO PUT IT DOWN ONCE YOU GET STARTED.VICTORY TO THE STRONG.
B00AAX68HG|1.0|Loved this game until I was told I had to spend money to continuing playing!  I am sick of these kindle apps wanting more money!!!!!
B00APJLFEG|4.0|C Scadden (on M Scadden's account): We saw this one with our 16 yr old daughter. Yes, 16! We are Disney fans and love many of the animated films. Just our speed. We are fans of hundreds of others as well. Just see our movie shelves. I just had to say that this was a really good one. I enjoyed it. My wife enjoyed it. My 16 yr old enjoyed it. In contrast to Paranorman, which we wish we had never seen. This one we may buy. It was truly made with kids in mind, not like others that forget that a G or PG means kids. I want to see it again on DVD so I can stop and see all the Monster movie References. I grew up with many of those old films and was fascinated by the amount that were in this film. I give this a 2 thumbs up.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Classic!  What more can you say.  It is a must have for anyone who loves good science fiction and romance.
B00A0NOF7G|4.0|I enjoyed this light, intriguing mystery. A very quick read, but really held my attention. Also has a nice little romance too. All in all, a good book.
B005K2YTG4|5.0|I dropped my kindle paperwhite a couple of times by mistake, but because of this awesome sleeve, my kindle doesn't even have a scratch. I'd recommend this sleeve to anyone buying a kindle simply because it's very functional and the price is a lot better than others. And it's cute :)
B003GYEGNO|5.0|Well written, kept your interest all the way to the end.  The story showed how far man would go for his vanity.
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|This set has a lot of interesting techniques, and is definitely worth the money!  Particularly noteworthy are the techniques for building the columns and the skylights.<br />I would highly recommend this!  It is not meant for young children, though, as the building process is sometimes difficult.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So captivating and kept me turning the pages to find out how those story evolved! Ready to find out what happens next!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|easy to use. choices are many in translations. have added info. that are easy to access. have enjoyed the availability.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love that I can sync to my other devices. It has been a big help in keeping me organized with my lists.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love it! One of the best books ever! Your such an amazing writer it really touch my heart. Never stop writing!!!!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This was the best of the series, I thought it was going to be too long, but it keeps you involved. Great Movie!
B00A757EFW|5.0|Remember playing this game is the 80's with my children.  Only game I could beat them when we played together.  Love playing it.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|It was OK at best, something just seemed off, didn't have the same flow as the other MIB movies in my opinion. Worth watching...
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Well written and researched.  I didn't like history in school but am very interested in it now, especially the way our country has deteriorated.  Its good to see what was done in the past and hopefully don't repeat mistakes.  I have even more respect for Lincoln and admire what a great mind he was.  Wish we could have him back today!
0345529057|5.0|I can hardly wait for more...something to really look foward to.  Too bad it's such a long time between releases of the newest ones.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I loved the book as much as the movie<br />It was amazing. I am going to read this to my daughter as she grows
0553801473|5.0|When I ordered the series of the first four, I didn't even realize the 5th had been published!!!!  Enough time has passed that I reread the first four, then ordered #5, and read it SLOWLY because I had thought there were only going to be FIVE.  Now I wait with bated breath for the next installment.
1439152802|5.0|Usually I can figure out the twist of a book by the halfway to 2/3 mark. But Morton keeps me guessing! Both in this book and The Distant Hours, I couldn't figure out what happened until I read it.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|I'm speakless. I have been waiting for this album and it was worth the wait! I'm only upset it did not come out sooner!<br />AWESOME!!!!!!!!!
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Would have been perfect if someone other than Kristen Stewart played Snow White but I really liked this take on the classic childhood story.
B007FZ7R7W|5.0|This a great energic album! Chris Brown makes great music! He never disappoints.<br />I def. recommend this album. I love it!
B0000042GM|5.0|Julius Katchen was a great pianist who left us too soon. His Brahms and List remain immortal. What joy! Technique! Imagination! This is a great recording.
B000AARKOO|5.0|I have read the story and the movie already on TV. It is very well done and clearly expose the chivalry character of the time between the opponent leaders involved in the Crusades in the XI & XII centuries. Excellent movie.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite apps. A great companion when I am about to travel, always with the information that I need readily available. I truly recommend it to all my friends.<br /><br />Alejandroomi
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I've played this on FB for quite sometime and was glad to see it as a Kindle app.  Works well on the Kindle Fire and links to my FB account so it's easy to flip from Kindle to laptop.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|There are so many detailed reviews here that I will keep mine short and to the point.  Skip the reviews, some of which rival the length of Les Mis, and read the book.  I confess that I probably would not have read it had I not seen the play and recently the movie. I fell in love with the music and started reading the book to get it out of my head. I am so glad I did and that I found the controversial abridged version which more easily held my attention.  This is a remarkable story of injustice, human frailty, redemption and hope. The book fills in many gaps about French life during this period and does it so well you can feel the grime, the cold and the mood of the characters. If you are a deep, analytic reader there are a wealth of reviews about the various translations, the injustice of the missing stories in the abridged version etc.  But if you want to read a book that will keep you thinking and feeling for the characters, read this.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|My son loves this game it's history and fun mixed together.<br />But they could make it to where your character does not run out of energy.
B0000CABJ1|2.0|If these were her best recordings then I don't agree with the producers choices.<br />It just didn't do it for me...it wasn't worth my limited financial resources.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|It kinda creeps you out but it is awesome :)it is worth getting :P I would buy more games off this company!
0525457585|5.0|We love reading from this book with our 5 year old. We have seen the movie several times and although the book is different, we all look forward to learning more about the story. When she sits in her dad's lap it is easy for her to see what is happening in Fantastica due to the different color words. I just wish the book came a little larger so I could make the cover look like the one in the movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|you should really get this app I mean I love minecraft so so so much!! I recommend this game for every single person who loves minecraft!!!!!!!  Thank you mojang for this game ever even being created!! :D
0670026603|4.0|I haven't cried after reading a novel since The Kite Runner.  Jojo Moyes is not the most talented writer but she knows how to touch the heart and soul of her readers. This story will stay with you for a long time. Reading this novel will make you reevaluate the choices you have made and give you the courage to keep challenging yourself.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I LOVE these books. I do not want  it to be over :( PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE write another book to continue the series!
B00992CF6W|5.0|So here is the thing so I used to play halo and then heard about minecraft and was playing it on my kindle and had amazing and heard about the mods for minecraft and that made it over 90000 well  you should really get minecraft pocket edition..
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|i like it but i dont love it. ok so its about this kid with this um.......  ugly face and he goes to school 1 day when he is 10/11 this is his first time and nobody likes him but at the end he is one of the most populer kids in schoo how? Find Out YOURSELF!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Works great on my kindle fire. Helps me to know<br />amount of time I have for different things before it<br />the battery runs out.<br />Does what it says.  No problems.
159413586X|5.0|I just love the way Suzanne Collins develops her storyline and plot..!if you adored HG book 1 +2, then it is impossible for you not to have this final, amazing, breathtaking book! how the story ends..!:)
B000UAE7RW|5.0|A masterpiece. Chinatown is one of the few examples of a perfect movie. Films just don't get any better than this. The cinematography, the music, the acting and of course the direction are all first rate. Polanski is a master director, and Chinatown is a great film to prove that point. Polanski got the best performances of their careers out of Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway. With lesser directors both of those actors are prone to ham it up and go over the top, often embarrassingly, but not here and the result is pure brilliance. In my opinion neither Nicholson or Dunaway have ever again matched the performances they gave in this film.
0525953728|5.0|The story puts the reader in the helicopters with the soldiers. You see the high level of training the men go through. You understand why Osama had to be killed and empathise fully with the US forces.
B00452VF4O|5.0|I couldn't put it down after I started reading.  It is so well written and has everything-the history of Wales and England, heroes, villains, romance,and adventure.  The characters were the real people of that time.  I am so looking forward to the sequels, Falls the Shadow and Reckoning.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|The Night Circus reads like an ambitious first effort novel.Each character,while interesting,longed for a richer,riper development.I wish there weren't so many loose ends. Each character begs to be developed into their own story,and while being cheated,are still a good supporting cast for the main characters.<br />Stunningly creative and beautiful writing flights of fancy,this book would be a knock out on the big screen.<br />A promising writer,I look forward to a more developed next novel by Ms.Morgenstern.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|It's not as fun as the other version in the windows. It's too cluttered for me and the characters are too similar to spot easily.
B001NHNG64|5.0|This was fairly predictable but such a good read! Thank you Lee Child. I will continue reading your masterpieces! JB
B007TXN4TK|1.0|it only lets u get 10 songs and it is not Christmas time and they have we wish u a merry Christmas its stupid too
B003TSEEDY|3.0|At first, the beginning was a tad boring so I stopped reading it. But when I picked it back up, I finished reading it in 3 days. Some of the sentence structure and language was a little hard to understand but it was still a great book.<br /><br />I loved this book and I definitely recommend it to everyone and I can't wait to see the movie :)
1601253788|5.0|I bought it for my kids for Christmas and they RP all the time they could not have been Happier
1601252463|5.0|I bought it for my kids for Christmas and they RP all the time they could not have been Happier
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|I purchased this App today as a Free App of the Day.  I wasn't expecting much; but, once I installed it and tried it out, I was really impressed.  It worked flawlessly on my Kindle Fire.  When I opened it up, I didn't have to login to my Facebook acccount.  I hit the Skip button instead.  Then, I selected 1 of the many video providers they listed and my 3 year old Samsung Smart Tv displayed an option to Allow the video to be played.  I Allowed it.  It was super easy. No setup was needed on TV and I didn't need to create an account via iMediaShare.  It even plays video in HD.  It has many preselected Video providers including You Tube, CNN, Vimeo among many others.  When you select You Tube, I was able to do a search and was able to play that on my TV.  I was able to play video that I uploaded to You Tube, too.  I was even able to play videos on my Kindle Fire on my TV.  Very impressive App.  I recommend it.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It kept my interest every bit as much as a good murder mystery. Bourdain is both candid and engaging. His insights into the food industry are sometimes shocking and always entertaining.At times I wondered how anyone could maintain this career and frantic lifestyle..then realized this fact was an underlying point of the book.<br />Anyone who loves food,cooking, cooking shows and the unique personalities & characters associated with that world should enjoy this book.
B005DOKM9M|4.0|I like the cover better than some others that I have seen.  Too much bling is not what I like so this is great!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Don't buy the cases.  These don't work.  Attempted to contact seller and they would not replace therm.  I do not recommend these or the seller.  Buyer beware.  The one star indicates I hate it.  If there was a lower rating then I would of used it
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Although this isn't the first time I've seen this type of game, this is by far the best presentation of it I've ever seen.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST APP EVER CREATED IN THE WHOLE APP UNIVERSE! IT IS SO ADDICTING AND I'VE BEEN PLAYING IT FOR TWO WEEKS STRAIGHT, 24-7! BUY &quot;ANGRY BIRDS&quot; NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003BVFZ4Q|4.0|The book takes quite some time to reach the pace, in contradiction to his own advise which eventually come forth in the second half of the book. Quite a large part of the first of the book is what Stephen King terms as back story, but once you reach to the second half of the book, the journey becomes worthwhile. You feel glad that you stuck to the book for such long, when real gems, the witty insights into the joy and art of writing starts flowing in on the pages from the master on the pages. Great insights in to the deeper aspects of art, with obvious advise like..two most important thing to be able to write are room with a door, and a willingness to shut that door.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the game and the horses . it is a good game for kids like 7 year Ole's and older peaple.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|&#34;Charlie&#34; is easy to fall in love with.  His letters will pull at your heartstrings - you will smile with him and maybe even cry with him.  A great story of a young boy experiencing high school life with his friends and family.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I read this book as a very close family member lay in a coma after surgery complications... she was just taken off life support.  it was comforting, enlightening, and gave me peace knowing she was heading for such an amazing place.  Thank you for sharing your experience.
B00886XQO0|5.0|As I gamer have to tell you awesome headset have had many headsets but nothing like this. Immerse yourself into the combat zone of your game. The sound is incredible and brings your game to another level. Love them
B00999DFP0|5.0|Purchased these for my son he is a big fan of the show. Absolutely loves it, hd quality on the playback.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Just what you expect from Jodi Piccoult.  A good story and a good read.  She writes beautifully.  I'd recommend it to a friend.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love the way this book didnt prolong the story like 50 Shades. In my opinion they do not compare. This book is more exciting!!!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|As an introvert I found a lot of truth in these pages. I found myself quietly nodding, even smiling all the way through. NOW I understand why I find myself back in my hotel room after a long day at a conference, wondering how I can be so antisocial. I wish this book was written years ago. I could have used a better understanding when my children were little - as much for my outgoing daughters as my son (a fellow introvert).Highly recommended, I'll be sharing this book with everyone I know.
0446343129|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read.  The first couple of chapters only set the stage for what is about to come.  This book is filled with a history of the dark side (dark in more than one way) of something that seems to be so sweet.  No wonder Duffy named it \\"sugar blues\\" because the blues is exactly what everyone gets who touches this drug.  When I was a child, I was not allowed to consume much of anything sweet let alone sugar itself. I did not understand the relationship between sugar and illness, and neither was it explained.  I have read many books on health and nurtition, but this book is the foundation and everything after it should come naturally.  Additionally, my initial lack of understanding made me crave for the very thing I saw everyone around me consuming.  This was surely an addiction, which I truthfully admit I have not completely given up.  But this book has helped me gain an understanding of sugar for the drug that it is, and its vice-like grip that is difficult to break.  Since sugar has never been a big part of my diet, I feel a little guilt in the small amounts of organic sugar (sugar is sugar) I use in only a few occasions. And I absolutely never use sugar subsitutes.  I must also say that I purchased many copies of this book to distribute to family members and a few close friends.  Although it has been some time since I read Sugar Blues, I still talk about it as if I just finished reading it.  And I know I will read it again since it is so educational, captivating and powerful.  [...]
B007TNS6JI|4.0|i liked it. it was fun excluding when the guy does not spawn. i also think the Magee guys need a buff
B006LSZECO|1.0|How did this book get so popular?  The characters were uniformly despicable and the situations completely unbelievable.  The lead characters each got what they deserved.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The only thing missing here is volume control. To play in bed or silently, you have to plug in earphones. Otherwise, the action is great!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I could not find season 2 anywhere on the internet except for short clips, so I decided to buy the season. I thought it was a good price for 9 full length episodes. I am completely addicted to this show and have watched every single night to get caught up with where they are now in the season. I am thankful that I could find it on Amazon and was easy to download in just minutes to my Kindle Fire.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Really liked the final book in the series. Was a tad disappointed with the ending even though it was a good ending. But considering all that happened in the trilogy, I found the ending a little boring. But overall...great book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|very fun game.  My 13, 10 and 6 year old kids all play it on the Kindle Fire and they love it.
1451673442|5.0|A great book. Very uplifting for the spirit. This book is very easy to read and I would recommend it to everyone.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Another great Bourne movie.  Miss Matt Damon but this movie is just as good as the others. Definitely worth watching.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am 46 years old and  have read one thousand books if I have read one, and I have never reacted to a book the way I did with Hopeless. It just touched me dierctly at my core. What else could a person ask of a story?
B0050R0YB8|5.0|Got this on discount over the Christmas period and it's an amazing set! It is so big it becomes the centre of attraction when guests come to your home.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like all the games, and yes some games are a little harder, but that's what makes it really fun!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Excellent story, full of twists.  Held my interest like some of his earlier books.Returned my hardcover gift for a kindle ebook.  Much easier to carry around.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Very cool app I really like hope more updates are coming really love the app any one who is a gamer well you better get this app.
B004J4WLB4|1.0|I wonder if the foster parent author had conflicts with the Children's Protective Services system.  Her presentation of CPS is negative and focuses on the worst.  The book is unrealistic.
0425252868|5.0|I picked up A Higher Call just before Christmas and liked it so much I went back for another copy to give to my 84 year old Dad as a gift. This book is compelling in so many ways. Not only is it an amazing story of the encounter of two enemies on opposite sides of the Great War, the book goes deeper and shows the human side of war and those who were called to fight. Adam Makos has done an excellent job of turning facts into a compelling story that catches the reader early on and never lets go. I can't say this often, but, I couldn't put this book down and when I wasn't reading it I was thinking about when I could get back to it. My father enjoyed the book as well and we called each other several times to discuss the characters and the story. I highly recommend this book - not just to WWII war and history buffs - but to anyone who loves aviation, adventure and a well-written story.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I was substitute teaching an 8th grade class, they were reading this book as an assignment, so I picked it up and started reading.  It is a quick read with many thought provoking ideas.  I enjoyed it very much.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This is one of the very best mystery games out there for Kindle Fire resplendent with HO scenes, clues and tools you can earn by solving puzzles and finding hidden objects to help you with your mission. Of this genre, this is one of the very best for any price. It is mesmerizing in graphic elements, atmosphere, creepiness and storyline. It played flawlessly and it is very long...it took me about 7 or 8 hours, but I'm not in it for the speed...I love to linger and look at all the beautiful graphics and incredible details. The story is macabre. The hints and games are great and there is also a journal and strategy guide to help you if you get stuck.  The hos are zoom-able and gorgeous and so interesting in their content.<br /><br />I want to just say that I really, really thank and appreciate Alawar for creating this game to play on KFHD and I wish there were so many more! I wish folks would take that fact into consideration when reviewing some of these games and being hypercritical of small flaws...This one has NONE and I would have paid a lot more for it. I hope many, many more people buy it and write Alawar to ask for more! Loved this experience; it is so much fun.
B0035YTG30|4.0|This film's about 60 years old, but is interesting for several reasons. It shows what Rome was like at that time, and it succeeds without any illicit sexual activity. Hepburn is uniquely appealing.
B004SBB0LU|5.0|Ik heb alles cd's met heel veel plezier beluisterd, deze cd's hebben mijn collectie compleet gemaakt. Dank je wel .
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I bought this game for my son.  It is kind of addicting and we have a family game about once a week.  It is nice that there is something we can do as a family without the use of modern technology.  The downside is that sometimes my son wants to play this when I want to do something else.  Another downside is that minimum player is 3 which is OK if my wife plays but with only two player, my son and I, the game loses some of its appeal.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Dank je wel voor dit album, het is een zeer compleet werk en een mooi overzicht wat MJ gemaakt heeft.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|End of the world apocalypse, zombies and hard decisions which impact ones survival over others.  How would you react if it was you in this situation?  Would you do whatever it takes for the survival of yourself and your family?<br />Thought provoking at times as well as suspenseful and entertaining.  I usually don't buy DVD of a show but this is an exception.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|A little too long but the special effects were fantastic. Good rainy weekend movie to kill some time. Don't go out of your way to see it.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|this is a fun game for the kiddies. now to beat midnight moon and save ponyville. long live my little ponies.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|Watched this on a plane ride. Okay movie that I would watch on a rainy weekend when this is on cable. Nothing special.
B004TI5N38|4.0|John pulled is an interesting man. Very much a product if his family and their military background. In his an well, a rebel. But, very much a soldier and a DID man.<br /><br />I think this may be the best series that Baldacci has going now. If you like the author, you will love this book. If you do nit like the author, you will still love this book.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|These kids are high school 17 -18 . Would  any parent want their high school daughter sneaking boys in her window and bed .Holder telling her I am going to have sex with you all the time so get on birth control .Colleen are you trying to compete with 50 shades? I love a good sexy book ,but she is only 17. What kind on message did you put out to young girls. The subject story was great.you could have told this great story with a different messages about making it sound ok to be sexual active.You have lost a lot of respect with a lot of your readers that I have talked to. I belong to several book clubs so many people are disappointed in you. We thought you had more values. 50 shades made lots of $ and publicity, guess you want the same at the expense of the message you give to young ladies.I did read your other books and loved them.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Well done, even if JGL's makeup is a bit distracting.  Still thinking about it two days later.  Not sure how much sense it makes ultimately, but we both watched it, tense and rapt, for the entire two hours.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Can't understand why the Amazon Fire was sold without this essential application.  I found it nearly impossible to determine the status of the battery without it.  Well, at least it's free... which it should be.  The product is almost defective without it.
B008VVT51U|5.0|This movie reveals the pain of age and the pain of love and how very sweet they are. As the people and events of our lives recede into the distance there are always more  friendships, love, heart aches and triumphs ahead of us; they simply arrive in different clothes.<br /><br />Never shy away, as your years advance, from the man or woman in a too brightly colored shirt or blouse. It may be the dance of a life time!
B009L7MD44|5.0|We use this with our Ipods and Ipads, works just fine. Fine, I did my job and they did theirs.

B007HACDLK|5.0|As my friends say, can he write a bad book?  We all wait for the next one.  There are so many people who need reading in their lives to cope with life, and Vince Flynn makes our days.  People at the cancer center can't wait to discuss his newest book.
B006GHA9VQ|3.0|Weber's music is always so beautiful.  Loved the Phantom of the Opera, so was very interested to see the continuation of the story.  I enjoyed it but it does not compare with the Phantom.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|As it's name implies the Dark Knight returns in what has to be the &#34;darkest&#34;<br />movies of the series. Do to spoil the movie plot but it is well written, acted and<br />presented. It's a must-see if you are any kind of a Batman fan. Love it!
B0011UJMK2|5.0|It was really good!  The book built from beginning to end.  It was exciting as the main characters had to sneak around a Stalin controlled Russia to solve a murder that the state refused to admit happened.

0800141709|4.0|Dr. Strangelove, 1964 film<br /><br />The story begins with talk of a \\"Doomsday Machine\\" sited on a fog-shrouded island. Next we see B-52 bombers flying high above the clouds (while the credits roll). We see a computer center with tape drives. \\"Condition Red\\". The base is sealed due to a shooting war. Private radios are confiscated. The Strategic Air Command keeps bombers constantly in the air in case of a sneak attack. One bomber receives a coded message: Plan R. Its confirmed. A general is buy with paperwork. The base can't be contacted. Is there a mistake? Soldiers are warned about the enemy, they can be disguised. That bomber opens its orders to drop a nuclear bomb on an ICBM complex. One radio is brought to Commander Ripper. Is something wrong? Is war too important to be left to the generals? The President is warned about this unauthorized action. Did General Ripper exceed his authority?<br /><br />\\"Plan R\\" allows a lower-level commander to initiate action. Can they be recalled? NO! Is General Ripper psychotic? A military force is sent to contact Ripper. General Turgidson recommends launching an all-out attack. Is he insubordinate? The Russian Ambassador was called to the War Room. They try to contact Premier Kissoff at a private number. The President talks to him about a terrible event. What can they do? \\"I'm very sorry.\\" \\"Do Svedanya.\\" The Doomsday Machine is operational. General Ripper warns about drinking water that isn't fresh and pure. The Doomsday Machine can destroy all life on the world! Ripper warns against fluoridation in water and food. Outside the shooting continues, then stops. Ripper goes to the washroom for privacy. One bomber is targeted by a missile. It hits! Its radio had been damaged and is inoperative.<br /><br />The low-flying bomber can't be detected by radar. Captain Mandrake dials the President via a collect call. No, he needs the right change. Can the Colonel get it? The recall code is sent and acknowledged. All the bombers are recalled, except one. Will its bombs set off the Doomsday Machine? There is a hitch on that one bomber, it will select a new target. They turn on the settings to arm the bombs. The bomb doors remain closed. Do they need a manual intervention? The Major makes it work! Dr. Strangelove uses a slide rule to calculate the number of years to remain underground to avoid nuclear radiation. [How reliable are those estimates?] This is followed by pictures of nuclear explosions. It's the end of the world as we know it! [The flaw in the one man to ten woman plan is that it created inbreeding and genetic defects.]<br /><br />This movie satirizes the Mutual Assured Destruction policy of nuclear warfare. It shows how \\"rational decisions\\" are flawed when based on lies and mistakes. Who really wanted to create multiple nuclear bombs and bombers? Weren't bombers less efficient in bomb delivery compared to rockets? The Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles became obsolete when they were replaced by low-flying stealth missiles. But these depend on satellites to receive directions. An upper atmosphere nuclear bomb would create an electro-magnetic pulse (EMP) that would destroy transistorized electronics (like a close lightning strike). Modern machinery would fail to work as well as the supply systems. This would be comparable to the damage caused by Hurricane Sandy to the Jersey Shore but would be all over the world. A supply of electricity would not restore function to dead electronics. There would be no water supply or delivery of food to people. [This story would be better if it was less of a satire or comedy.]
B0064T6LV8|4.0|This game is cool.Its kinda tough to see but worth it.I wouldve liked more levels but am satisfied.It does what it says itll do.

B004Y042N8|4.0|It's a pretty nice puzzle game, and the neon-on-black visuals are bright.<br /><br />My only complaints are that you MUST tap your path instead of having the option of \\"drawing\\" your path, which is a weird restriction given that the puzzles themselves trace your path as you tap. Why not just trace the path yourself?<br /><br />Also, when you mess up on a puzzle, the game screams at you with this really annoying sound effect. It would have been nice if they chose a less annoying sound.
B004M5HUXE|1.0|a contest as to how many words can be used to describe trivia.  very little story encased in a mountain of words
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This book covers the entire 100 years of the twentieth century with belly laughing comedy and wanderful insight.  It is just brilliant.
B004GYY714|4.0|It's simple and easy and I'm able to listen to WTOP from my Kindle.  Works better than I HEART RADIO.
