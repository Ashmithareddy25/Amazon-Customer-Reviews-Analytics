B00BD99JMW|3.0|*Spoilers* First of all let me just say that I cheated. I read a bunch of reviews on Amazon a couple of days after the book came out and so I was emotionally prepared for the ending.<br /><br />Perhaps because of this mental and emotional preparation, I was okay with Tris’s death. While it might not have been what I wanted to happen, it made sense for her character and for the plot line. And having Tris prove immune to the death serum, but then die immediately after from bullet wounds was a great twist. I can be at peace with how things played out and how Tobias (Four) and Evelyn eventually reconcile. I love how many of the characters remain friends and start their lives over together after the experiment is disbanded. The only disappointment in terms of character development was Peter. The way that Roth had the inner conflict of Peter play out was interesting and unpredictable – it showed that even the most evil of people could perhaps find redemption. But I was not a fan of Peter once he took the memory serum – he was at first a dumb baby, and then sort of disappeared from the story with the shallow explanation that some of his harsher traits had resurfaced. I felt this was a poor wrap-up to an integral and interesting character.<br /><br />I gave the book three stars mainly because of the Tris and Tobias POV switching. Had this been done well, it would have made the book. But it was not done well. Not at all. In fact I kept finding myself in the middle of chapters and not being able to figure out if Tris or Tobias was narrating. The fact is, Roth could not seem to write from a male point of view. Tobias sounded like a girl. And he sounded just like Tris. It was beyond disappointing for such a strong character in the first two books.<br /><br />My final thought is that while I’m fine with Tris’s death, and her sacrifice to save Caleb’s life, I would have wished for Tris and Tobias to have a more united front in this last book. It would have been far more satisfying if they bickered less, lied less, and tried to spend as much time together as possible. Then we readers could feel like they’d had their time and Tris’s death was a tragic, but beautiful end.<br /><br />Instead Tris and Tobias seemed to disconnect from one another at every chance possible. They still couldn’t seem to trust each other. They spent little time actually in one another’s presence and when they did, they were either fighting or making out. This made her death feel more wasteful and much less tragic.<br /><br />Overall, while I did not love the end to this trilogy, I didn’t hate it either. I’m satisfied with how Roth has wrapped things up, even if the society she portrayed has been written before and written much better (“Pines” by Blake Crouch). “Divergent” alone is the reason to read this series – the chemistry between Tris and Tobias hooks you instantly and carries you through till the end of “Allegiant.”re satisfying if they bickered less, lied less, and tried to spend as much time together as possible.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|Wow. Best series I've ever read. Even with the crazy ending. Not all stories need a happy ever after and real life is not that way. It's good to show that life goes on even after something like that happens.  That was the problem with Twilight. Even though I loved the stories so much I read them 3 times, it taught people that you shouldn't try to live without your soulmate or true love. Bella felt no self worth. This book teaches the opposite and will always be my favorite for that reason. We are worth what we make of ourselves. Not who we identify with.

The heads are mounted on springs to give them movement, and there are actually little pieces of &#34;flesh&#34; that you drop into the water as well. The distilled water becomes cloudly which adds a really interesting effect when the light is on. This is a must-have item for The Walking Dead fan in your life. We could not be more please with it.

B007FG9LIE|1.0|This book was truly amazing, IN A VERY BAD WAY.<br /><br />To state the obvious-some books are good and some are bad. This one was bad, really bad. And while I just hate to be contrary to all of these 4 and 5 stars reviews, am am going to anyway. If Amazon allowed one<br />to give this book review less then one star, this would be the one.<br /><br />To me this book was both juvenile and predictable. The characters were shallow and the story was weak. Although I know I am growing older, it seemed that this book would be a good one for a struggling teenager reader. I don't mean to offend reviewer's sensibilities, but I just thought this sucked big time. I am going to return it as soon as this review goes public.

1451620829|4.0|\\"Makeup To Breakup: My Life In And Out Of Kiss\\" by Peter Criss is the autobiography of the originial Catman, the original drummer, of the Rock Band Kiss. This is his side, and his story, of the years during and after his life with the larger than life rock phenomena known over the world as the hottest band in the land - KISS.<br /><br />Growing up, Peter Criss was my favorite of the band. \\"Hard Luck Woman\\" is still probably my favorite of all kiss songs, and I even had my Dad paint my face as Peter back for one Halloween in the 70s.  With that said, I don't know if I needed to know everything Criss wrote about in this book. It did take some away from the childhood heroes and rock gods that KISS were at the time.<br /><br />Yes, I knew of the drug and alcohol problems of Criss and Ace Frehley that contributed to the break up of the original four band members, but I didn't know just how much tension and fighting between them really existed throughout the years. Sure, the other three have their side of the story as well, but even though he complains about the other three band members, Criss does own up to the fact that he created many of the problems himself with his drug and alcohol use. (In the book he even admits to being a complainer.)<br /><br />Criss writes candidly about the drugs, sex and rock and roll.  Maybe too much at times. I'm not sure I needed to know about the anatomy of the members of KISS. But it was interesting to read about the completely wild and abandoned lifestyle they led and the tolls it took on all of them. It was also interesting to see how the money, fame, women, alcohol and drugs were such a large part of the lifestyle and how they each affected the members in negative ways. It can make one wonder if such a lifestyle is really worth it. Some would say yes, and others would definitely say no.<br /><br />I like that Criss wrote about his time in rehab and how he finally got clean and then found a relationship that was healthy. I also like that he and his current wife are now together happily. I also like that he admitted that he treated people badly, even his current wife at times. And while Criss had a Catholic upbringing, I don't know about the last little bit on his relationship with God. I'm sure it is important to him, but I don't know if his prayers on the road when he was heavily into drugs and groupies were what he might selectively remember now.<br /><br />I didn't like that Criss seems to blame others a bit too much, and didn't come across as remorseful as maybe he should have about the things he did that contributed to the failed relationships and other failings in his life. But then, we all tend to clean up things from our past in our own minds and memories.<br /><br />Reading \\"Makeup To Breakup\\" was a nice change of pace from what I usually read, and I enjoyed reading about the exploits of the legendary rock band that I've listened to since I was little. While I didn't like that there was so much turmoil and fighting among the band members, it is what it is, and I appreciate Criss telling his side of the story. I'm sure that is how he remembers it, and feels about it, but if you were to read all four member's account side by side, you would probably find the truth somewhere in the middle of it all. But since Criss was my boyhood favorite, I'm glad I  read his side to get his perspective. It was an interesting read that I enjoyed as a change of pace.<br /><br />Reviewed by Alain Burrese, author of [[ASIN:1937872068 Lost Conscience: A Ben Baker Sniper Novel]] and others.t he and his current wife are now together happily.

B002UXRGM0|5.0|Its quite sad that this Blu ray has a lot of bad reviews, mainly because of Opera and because of it not playing of US players. While I certainly can't say much about the Opera narrated version--in fact, the same bad reviews on here about her version is why I purchase the David Attenborough-Narrated Verison instead--what I can say is this: The version I got, narrated by Sir Attenborough is, and i quote: &#34;&#34; WARNING: For sale or rental for private home use in the USA and CANADA only.&#34;&#34; What? So as opposed to what the product description has on here (Amazon.com) that it is region free, if I got a David Attenborough-Narrated Version that is region 1 (USA and CANADA), what are those other reviewers talking about? You telling me there are several other versions of this? I posted 4 pictures. The last one I posted as the fine print...the region encoding stuff.
B001GSTOAM|5.0|This is an excellent book, a &#34;must read&#34; for everyone who write code or is involved in the quality of it.

B00132S74A|1.0|It is hard to believe that anyone liked this book.  Prose is lumbering and boring.  Characterization is  juvenile. While concept had possibility, the actual plot could not have been worse.  The first scene is entertaining and the rest of this book is awful.  I don't believe that Ken Follett wrote it, seriously, I think that he had it ghostwritten using his name to sell the book. Lots of little mistakes, sister's name alternately Alice/Emily, timing etc.  But here is what I cannot freaking believe. . .this WHOLE book is about the moon landing and THE DATE IS WRONG!  says 1968 -- moon landing was 1969!! How could this happen??  How did an editor not see this??<br /><br />This book is sickeningly terrible. How did anyone like this?
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|It is very similar to the Facebook Castleville.  My problem is the fake 110 coins that was promised by Amazon.  I got frustrated by Castleville on Facebook after a while.  I figured I would give it a go around since there was this big coin bonus.  I started downloading it and went to bed.  Now, the offer is gone and there are no extra coins in my bank.  What gives, Amazon?  This game would have got 4 or more had it not been for the fake offer.

B008220BLG|3.0|It started out good and had some great fun in it, but by the end it seemed to take it self too seriously. It looks like they we having trouble deciding if it should be funny or serious.. going for both meant that they kept stumbling off the line throughout the movie and never quiet got it consistent. If they just made up their mind, it could have would have been fantastic.

B001AQO3QA|1.0|This Box Set of the Alien Anthology is a real shame. The set obviously has issues with playing by reading other reviewers (wish I read more of them before I bough it). The disks didn't work for me either. If the disks played I would have loved this set, maybe minus the fact that the disks slid in and out of a paper sleeve. When are manufactures going to relalize collectors don't want a case that could damage the disks. I though the main point of having a case is to protect the disk. Well if you're real careful then I guess it's okay. But does it matter if they don't play. And I love how another reviewer said he called the number on the box for tech support and got no help, in fact they put the blame on the customer. I don't and haven't had any problems playing any Blu Ray disks except this set.<br /><br />I also want to say Booo on Amazon for making an item with obvious problems the Deal of the Day. $20 is great for a Blu Ray box set, even greater for a Alien box set. $20 bucks is way too much for disks that do not work.

1476734941|3.0|As my husband suggest I read this book so we can do the plan together I did.  He doesn't read or believe in any diet plans out there.  He exercises regularly and is never over weight but always has 10-15 lbs. he wants to shed.  He loved the book.<br /><br />My major complaint with the book is the word FAST.  I've always come to believe that to mean NO FOOD at all, NOT LOW CALORIES.  That I think is a big misconception with the material.<br /><br />I am also skeptical of the medical claims. If you read his words at times he says based on logical thinking one could sum up that this or that would be the result or something to that affect.  That's not science yet.  I am quite surprised that my husband has drank the 5/2 cool-aid as he is a card carrying member of the skeptic society.<br /><br />I find these faults with the book:<br /><br />1.  No you can't just pig out on the other 5 days you really need to count your calories or eat rather healthy.  He glosses over this.<br />2.  FASTING to me at least is NOTHING but water and tea etc. for the day, no food.  Or else 500-600 calories is a LOW calorie diet NOT FASTING.<br />2.  His recipes though few I found to have ingredients that are not healthy for you i.e. american cheese, bacon<br />3.  It really is the same as daily calorie counting he just does it in 2 days rather than 7. So just another gimmicky diet book until scientific evidence is substantiated.<br />4.  Anyone over the age of 40 should only lose 1 lb. a week and that should be on an exercise plan.  Your skin/body needs to catch up with the weight lose and unless you want a bunch of sagging skin keep to 1 lb. a week.  But I don't think he even makes mention of this, but I could be wrong.<br /><br />I lost 20 lbs.. last year all by myself following NO diet plan by just lowering my calories daily, eating healthy 24/7, and juicing.  I cut out these major items:  pasta, pizza al white flour products including bread and ALL processed supermarket food.<br />I also exercised 1-2 hours a day. Within 3 months my abs were showing and I looked amazing.<br />So, my advice to all is there is no &#34;shortcut&#34; to losing weight.  People in general are extremely lazy and losing weight is a lot of work.  But it is possible to lose weight if you want it really bad enough.<br /><br />I have gained a 8 lbs. back ONLY because I have leg injuries and had to quit exercising for a while and than got stressed out and stopped eating healthy.  I am trying this 5/2 with my husband to see if it's a plan I'd like to stick with.  But honestly you will have just as much energy by getting rid of these items in your diet:  Pasta, Pizza, all white flour products, Sugar (the devil), salt and anything processed/packaged supermarket food..  It takes your body something like 21 days to get rid of your food addictions.  I am a chocoholic and when I was eating healthy I didn't even crave chocolate.<br /><br />If you want something bad enough like weight loss you can do it just have to be disciplined.

0439023521|5.0|A gripping, grim, and excellent read. It's a terrible bedtime book - it was so suspenseful I had trouble putting it down and turning out the light, then once I had the tension kept me awake.<br /><br />Although not entirely unpredictable - I foresaw some version of the climactic scene at the end of the Hunger Games way in advance - the plot certainly took turns I did not expect.<br /><br />I put off reading this book for quite awhile despite recommendations from colleagues because of the subject matter, but the book is written in such a way that the Games were more palatable than I expected.<br /><br />I would have liked a little more meat to the main male character Peeta - perhaps that will come in the next book - but the main female character Katniss is admirable and interesting. I will be starting the second book as soon as I can get my hands on it!<br /><br />***<br />ADDED AFTER I FINISHED THE TRILOGY:<br /><br />As a librarian, I like to read books that readers are talking about. As the leader of the library’s Movie of the Book club, I also keep an eye on books being made into movies. The Hunger Games series by Suzanne Collins falls into both of these categories – a movie based on the first book is scheduled to be released in 2012 – and I finally made it a priority to read it.<br /><br />The Hunger Games has a horrific premise. A future version of the United States, Panem, damaged by war and climate change, hosts a yearly event called the Hunger Games. To punish its twelve Districts for rising up against the Capitol (and losing) decades earlier, two young adults from each District are chosen by lottery every year and sent to the Capitol to fight to the death in an arena while the whole country watches on television. One victor emerges.<br /><br />Because of the depressing plot, I dragged my feet on reading the series. However, once I started I found it hard to stop. The three books in the trilogy are difficult to take. They are grim, violent, and disturbing. However, they are also exciting, full of unexpected plot twists, and told by a flawed and compelling narrator.<br /><br />The first book in the series is The Hunger Games. It is the strongest book in the series. It grips your imagination and won’t let go. It begins with an introduction to Katniss Everdeen, a sixteen-year-old who lives in District 12 with her mother, her little sister, and her sister’s pet Buttercup, “the world’s ugliest cat.” Katniss’s life is a hard one: never having enough to eat, hunting illegally to get food, scrambling to survive. Still, she has family and good friends.<br /><br />But it’s reaping day, the day two youths in each District are chosen as “tributes” and sent to the Capitol to entertain its citizens by fighting to the death in punishment for rebellion. When her sister’s name is chosen, Katniss volunteers to take her place. Then the boy for District 12 is chosen. He is Peeta Mellark, a boy in her class at school, a boy she is not friends with but owes a debt to all the same. And from that point on, their fates are intertwined as they head to the Capitol and the Hunger Games.<br /><br />The similarity to our own reality television shows is obvious and no doubt intentional. The 24 contestants are polished and prepped, then presented to the viewers to choose favorites. While the cameras roll there are breathless interviews, the revealing of secrets, and prurient interest in the lives of the contestants. And then the Games begin.<br /><br />Most of the first book takes place during the Games. The author makes you feel the narrator’s desperate desire to live. She also makes you feel the moral dilemma Katniss faces in knowing that to survive, every other contestant, including her fellow tribute from District 12, must die. The book made my heart race and gave me nightmares, but it also made me desperate to know what happened next. Although it concludes in a satisfactory manner, it is clearly a Book One that urgesyou to continue on to Book Two, Catching Fire.<br /><br />As so often happens with a series, Catching Fire is not as good as the first book in the series. The novelty of the plot has worn off, but the pain and horror of the situation in Panem for the citizens of the Districts has not.  That’s not to say it’s not a good book. It is, and it continued to take plot turns I did not expect. There was no doubt I felt compelled at the end to forge on to Mockingjay, the final book in the series. Katniss continues to grow and change, as do the people and the situations around her, leading to a difficult but acceptable series conclusion that left me thinking about conditions in our own world. The themes of this series will stick with me for a long time.
B003B02O0A|5.0|Great book. Kept your attention. Didn't want to put it down. Going to watch/ the movie now. Hopefully it will be just as good

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|THIS IS A GREAT GAME FOR EVERYONE YOUNG AND OLD ALIKE.IT IS GREAT TO FIND.NEW FACEBOOK FRIENDS ALONG THE WAY IT'S A GREAT GAME
B0060D123K|5.0|This is one of those movies that I watch every year around Christmas! It never gets old. I almost feel like it isn't Christmas without watching this!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Fun game. Good graphics,works well on the kindle fire... Good for kids as well. A bit time consuming though. Be prepared to get sucked in.
B00AGJ4HC2|3.0|Fun game for what it is. Easy to get people into that don't play many games. However I don't see the strategy, seems like it just comes down to a lot of guessing. Not a bad game at all though especially for the price.
B000URWYTS|1.0|Boring. Had trouble getting through n certainly wring nineteen word about the book. I hate giving up reading a book n rather than stopping I continued probably to make myself miserable n certainly was successful. I guess my nineteen words are complete.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|The characters are interesting; the story lines are complex and interwoven and I want to know what is going to happen next. In addition the acting and scenes set to the period are excellent.
B004UNX1LS|4.0|I like this app very, very much.  It seems you can't find videos on the tv any more but you can hear.  The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 star rating is because at my age(63), I like older videos of classic rock and roll .  I understand it is necessary to appeal the the younger generation more and they would use this sort of app more so than I would, but a few more of my likeing would be great.<br />The Guns and Roses November Rain video although great is kinda getting old....
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book makes me feel 20 years old again. It also reminds me that I'm really 40. Basically, this book is a portal between 1984 and 2014. Eff the future. I want to relive the 8-bit world. &#60;3
B00GFOIUVQ|2.0|The start of this game has nothing to do with The Dark World, beginning instead with Loki leading a battalion of frost giants to kill Asgardians, which doesn't fit the Cinematic Universe continuity at all. I was hoping the game would be about Thor fighting alongside Loki, like the film, maybe even let one play Loki, but if it ever gets there, the start of the game has completely soured me on finding out. It's probably just as well -- the graphics are decent, but endlessly tapping the screen to fight is dull and tiring, and my hand blocks my view.
B00FQPHA0M|5.0|First, I love a reboot. The new relationship between &#34;Clark&#34; and Louis is awesome. Secondly, I love the way Henry Cavill dedicated himself to the character. In a way, it was like watching Christopher Reeve do it all over again. In another way, it was fresh, new, and intriguing to watch. Plus - I won't lie - Henry Cavill's ass, though hard to pinpoint behind all that cape action, was a much superior ass in the Superman universe, and I thank him for working so ridiculously hard to meet the physical requirements of this epic role. Henry, if you ever decide to take a quality dip in the man pond, I'm your guy. Just hit me up, dude. Utmost respect and discretion upheld.<br /><br />xoxo,<br />NaeNaeNOLA
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|I've lately rediscovered history especially the history of our country in the 20th century.  Bill Bryson weaves together stories of a plethora of famous names and gets at their personalities too. I found the inventions, the fads, the styles, the passions of that era well-documented in an enjoyable readability. I think the only way one would not enjoy this book would be by being a stone-cold anti-history reader.  For others like me, buy it, read it, and enjoy it -- very much!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Preston and Child are my two of my favourite authors and Pendergast is one of my favourite characters. I have read all their books.
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|A bit of fluff, nothing too substantial, sort of like a piece of meringue -- light and satisfying. It made me smile throughout and (spoiler alert!) I like a happy ending.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun game. Needs a good tutorial. I was expecting it to be hard to get very far in but the don't require a lot of your money for extras which is nice.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I couldn't stop reading the books. I have red all three in the past month. I was happy that this book had more content and less sex, the sex got really boring. It was interesting to read Christian's internal dialogue at the end.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game because you get to collect all the ponys<br />And set goals and its my little pony
B000P2A256|4.0|I love Maroon 5 had to find a certain song! Waited forever for this one! Found it here on amazon!!!!<br />Love it!!! Adam never dissappoints!
B006Q2LTRO|5.0|Very helpful in a struggling relationship. it makes a lot of things make so much sense. I love this book. Find out you and your spouses love language.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|This is more than how to write a story, it is about the workings of a great writer's mind and how he got to the stories he wrote.<br /><br />I found it deeply insightful and thought provoking. If you like King, and you like to read, buy this book, you will love it!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|The music was soothing, a nice way to wake up! Very easy to upload and set your personal settings the way you like it. Tremendous app for sure!
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Love the further use of such great characters.  Ozzie Walls, Jake Brigance, Lucien Wilbanks, Harry Rex Vonner...all jump off the page.  However, the narrative dragged and the denouement felt anticlimactic.  The Confession was one of my favorite books.  I was hoping for similar emotion and power from Grisham's latest installment.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Loved this! I had no idea what to expect. I don't usually read this type of book, but my husband and son we're talking about the movie they were making. I couldn't put this one down. It's very clever how it's written. The only negative is that the book ended too soon. I wanted more. The movie is nothing like the book. The book is ten times better than the movie.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Easy to use, 5 yr old manipulating the larger puzzles easily. Would be nice if we could add our own pictures to be puzzles.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|In the beginning, it was confusing with the introduction of so many characters. But after the beginning, the pace picked up and I really enjoyed it.

0385351399|2.0|The impact of internet and social media on relationships, lifestyles and social norms sounds like an excellent topic that can be explored in many dimensions in a novel. I guess I was really excited about the potential of such a book that I made two mistakes: My first mistake was to take a risk and order this book before the release date (i.e. before there were any reviews on Amazon). My second mistake was to give in to my stubbornness and finish it despite the fact that it clearly wasn't worth my time.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, author's understanding of the technology behind the internet and social media applications is relatively naive. Looks like the author simply didn't spend much some for doing some basic research on the topic. Some of the assumptions in the book about what may be technologically possible in the relevant time frame easily exceeds the limits of science fiction and enters the fantasy genre - I am pretty sure that was not the intent.<br /><br />The character development is relatively weak. Most characters appear to be single dimensional, they feel like caricatures rather than persons. The insecurity and neediness of Mae throughout the book is particularly disturbing.  To be fair, there are a few interesting ideas in the book (and therefore my 2-star rating instead of a 1-star) but they are quite sparse in the nearly 500 pages of mostly insignificant babbling.<br /><br />I am hoping to see a better novel from a more capable writer on this topic soon...
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Best game in the world never seen anything like every one should down load it.love it love it love it love it
B002KKCVT6|4.0|I've been primary a sport-sandal wearer for almost a decade, and these are good sandals; very comfortable, didn't need breaking it, fit well and looked good.  Amazon had an especially good deal on them in early 2012, so after I got one pair, I got another to alternate in the hope that that they'd last longer.  After 18 months of regular use, both pairs are pretty much worn out of tread and the slightly older of the two is looking pretty frayed in the upper.  I usually get about a year out of a pair of Teva's, worn almost daily (except for the gym and the occasional formal occasion), so basically 9 months per pair is a little disappointing.<br /><br />OTOH, they were also less expensive than the leather-upper ones I usually get, so in the long run it comes out as a wash.  They do make a leather-upper version of this (the &#34;Katavi Leather&#34; -- easy naming scheme, eh?) and I may try that or the Katavi next.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's a great game when you have spare time or even when your bored. It's one of my favorite games, but on my device it takes a while to update! But all together it's a great game (:
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The writing is great. The story is compelling. I felt like some of the characters were speaking for me!  Couldn't put it down.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I really enjoyed reading the kindle edition Diary if a Wimpy Kid The Third Wheel  it's exactly like the real book but on your Kindle Fire
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Quintessential John Grissom. A great read. For such a small town, a lot of historic things have happened in that created non-utopia called Clanton, MS. I never get enough.
0316055433|2.0|This book was over-hyped by pre-release reviewers.  Tartt is a reasonably good writer, but no amount of reasonably good writing - and the amount here is prodigious - can cover up a thin plot.  I am waiting for Tartt to have a good story to tell.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|For some reason, I can't install this app and I have tried it multiple times and I even reset my Kindle Fire to get it but it still doesn't work!
B000SEGHT6|3.0|My first Vonnegut, interesting.  Slightly depressing, but only slightly.  Might try another, but not right away.  Need to read something a little lighter first.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun game, great to pass the time when you just need a distraction. Takes some brain power at some levels but luck is a big help too :) Highly addictive. Definitely recommend. Plus it's FREE!
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Works good just wish it was like all other games and you could invite ppl who play it other than facebook friends
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Easy to setup, easy to use. I use this a lot. It has become the primary way I watch youtube and netflix, replacing my apple tv for the most part. I did have to restart the device once or twice since I have owned it to fix some glitchs. Steaming from a computer works pretty good. I just wish more apps supported it, which is happening slowly.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Suits is new, inspiring, funny, and underdog. The story line keeps you interested every step of the way. I am definitely hooked on this one.
0812982622|2.0|While I don't deny this is a well written tale, I can only offer 2 stars. This is because the story was chocabloc full of torture, backstabbing, fear and recrimination and If I could use only one word to describe this book it would be \\"brutal\\".<br />Well, I know little of North Korea apart from the fact it has been and still is ruled with an iron fist by a despot. That the people are subjected to torture should they step out of line and are little more than robots in a sad and secret land. Whilst I was reading The Orphan Masters Son it was reported on the media that eighty citizens of North Korea were shot in front of large selected audience because it was discovered they had contraband television sets and were watching Western television programs. So......the story is probably not a stretch of the imagination, however it would have been a more enjoyable read if it was more balanced. Ok, there were specks of kindness, love and humanity from time to time, as well as a touch of black humour. However,in the main, this is a very bleak and dark read. Some will say, this is a ridiculous statement and the author would not have been true to anyone had he \\"softened\\" the blows.......HOWEVER it IS a work of fiction and he may have reached a larger audience if it was more tempered.<br />In the meantime I would not recommend this book to my worst enemy.....on second thoughts maybe I would.
B00EC0VVRA|5.0|Would some discerning audiophile please tell us which transfers were used for this set?  The last two reissues of Szell's Beethoven Symphony cycle sounded very different: the &#34;Original Jacket&#34;-series reissue was DSD-remastered, and sounded smoother, more spacious, and more transparent than the previous, single-disc budget reissues (&#34;Essential Classics&#34;, I think). Alas, it quickly went out of print (I missed it!), and was replaced by a large set containing both the symphonies and the piano concertos with Fleisher: that was sourced (I think) from Sony France, and sounded even harsher than the old single discs.<br /><br />Despite the &#34;24/96 Remastering&#34; logo on the back, Sony's latest reissue of the Concertos with Fleisher sounds identical to the old budget single discs...and it has been rumored about that Sony slaps this logo on the back of its newer reissues whether they've been remastered or not. So, what about this new reissue of the Symphonies? Can anyone out there with a big collection aand a good ear compare its sound to the &#34;Original Jacket&#34; box? The big box of the Symphonies and Concertos? The 5 single discs on &#34;Essential Classics&#34;? Enquiring minds wish to know....<br /><br />Of course, none of this would matter if the performances weren't so magnificent. They deserve the best sonics possible.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun strategy game. Not to hard but not to easy. Ready for more rooms. This is the first game I've tried like this and I'm ready to find more.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just couldn't put this book down...great characters, great plot.  A new fresh tale with twists I didn't expect. I'm especially happy that all five stories were sold as one.  It would have been very frustrating to have to wait!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Entertaining, challenging, and slightly addictive game. Not sure it's worth all the hype, but it's still a great game. Haven't had purchase anything yet, but I'm that day will come.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is extremely helpful when you don't know if it is charged or not. It also shows you how long you have to participate in certain activities on your device before it dies.

0470876417|5.0|This is a smart tool to which insures focusing on details in any business plan. I have used this book and the poster for designing five businesses. Repeating the steps forced us to come up with details we otherwise would certainly have skipped.
B006MHWXMS|2.0|what am i even doing here? i dont understand what or how to operate this software at all. bad app.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I really love everything about this show.  It is so well written, you are immediately drawn in to the story.  And the casting is tremendous.  Maybe I find the show fascinating because it is so foreign to life as I know it.  Anyway, I always find myself rooting for the characters, regardless of whether they live 'upstairs' or downstairs.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|LOVE this show!!! I bought this season so I could get caught up on some episodes I missed. Amazon had it reasonably priced as well
B001BC2ZS6|4.0|Bought for my daughter for a school project. Great that she can read on her phone, ipod, ipad or kindle.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I started this show in the second season so I wanted to catch up on everything I missed. Amazon had the best price so I bought it here!
B00DW36G32|3.0|Pretty crappy really.  Travolta as an ethnic herzochechobosnian or whatever he is was pretty amusing.  Archery stunts require suspension of disbelief.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|It says that I need to update in order to continue to play. How do I do that? I have clicked on update and it won't do anything.
B00EK0UBPU|3.0|This is a very unusual read. I know it won the Booker award this year, but that still does not warrant 5 stars for me. It took some time to understand the plot and really the story does not come together until the final 80% of the book where at this stage the writer goes back to the beginning to explain the reasons for each characters situation. Great description of life on the New Zealand west coast but at times the characters were confusing.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is so epic so retaliated to the movie so awesome! You gotta go to the game Right now I SAID RIGHT THIS INSTINT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0307719774|4.0|Love this book. My husband and I have been doing it together for nearly a year now and it is so much fun. I can't wait to see how it is once we have finished it. Great quality so that even though we are opening every day we haven't had any issues with it starting to fall apart - but  we are only  a year in - so we will see! The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because sometimes it feels like the questions repeat (within the span of one year) or are really similar. Still fun, and makes for a great gift!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Saw a movie preview and was curious about the book.  From start to finish, I  could not put this moving, exceptional book down.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book has changed my thinking about my everyday life. I always feel negative about everything. My outlook is so different now. I feel energized and excited to try and keep up with all the lessons in the book.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I'm still reading. . . .but it's definately keeping my attention.  John Grisham is a great writer.  I have always enjoyed reading anything he writes.
B0089LOG02|4.0|The book was well written and easy to read, but. Niambh, the 9 yo orphan, broke my heart a hundred times.

B00CAJMGDI|5.0|A fun collection of songs by Youtube sensation Lindsey Stirling. This girl can really put together some fun music. I love her modern use of the violin.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I don't read much science fiction, but this has a dystopian element, too.  For example, Ender is a &#34;third&#34; meaning his parents were authorized by the government to have more than the allowed two children.  Gifted kids will enjoy this book, because Ender is a genius--with all the good and bad that come with great gifts.<br /><br />Ender and other gifted children are identified, taken from their families, and trained to save their planet from aliens.  Ender struggles under the pressure of being the best, of knowing that somehow he is being used, and of fearing that he is a bad person.  The ending was a surprise for me, so I was impressed--I'm not easily surprised.
B00BI6SSMC|5.0|Can Iron and Wine make a bad album? Sure they have albums that I am less fond of, but everything Sam Beam puts out is superbly done. The Shepherd's Dog is still my favorite album closely followed by Our Endless Numbered Days, but Ghost on Ghost is a solid album.
B009UNGYHG|3.0|I like the idea of the recharageable case to keep my ear piece safe and ready to go on short trips. I guess i have a strangely shaped ear canal, because it does not fit me as snug as i would like it even with the provided replacements . Picks up back ground sounds very well, could be distracting to the person you are talking to.
B006H3MIV8|5.0|I am not a huge fan of the country style covers on the album, but with fun covers by punk/rock bands such as Rise Against, Flogging Molly, etc. this is a great album for Dylan fans. I really enjoyed You Ain't Goin' Nowhere covered by Brett Dennen, Ballad of Hollis Brown by Rise Against, Blowin' In The Wind by Ziggy Marley,  With God On Our Side by K'naan (I like how he changed it up a bit), and The Times They Are A-Changin' by Flogging Molly.
B00008G7UF|4.0|This is a classic - if you haven't seen it, there's a degree to which you can't truly appreciate Kevin Kline. Meg Ryan is typical early 90's Meg Ryan (think &#34;You've Got Mail&#34;), so that's predictable and fine, I suppose, but Kline steals the show (sometimes literally - he plays a thief!). the story is cute and, again, predictable, but fun to watch for the French scenery, the variety of character actors who enter and exit on a regular basis, and Kline's memorable and incredibly fun performance.<br /><br />The warddrobe hasn't aged well, but, given that this was released in the 90's, that's to be expected.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|This is the only book I've read about North Korea, but I can't imagine finding one better than this. A must read.
B00D0N5CSO|5.0|Typical Peter Robinson with twists in the tale.  Robinson spins the story to keep the reader engaged, showing his keen insight into human behavior.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This, much like many YA books I've read, has the fortunate ability to both entertain and teach.  It's heartwarming to read books that, not only teach Young Adults, but the older generations as well.  I read books the way I watch movies, with an open mind.  I'll admit, I welled up at the thought of Four losing Tris.  But, the connection level to the characters is what makes this particular series wonderfully unique.
B00936A0RU|5.0|The price was amazing first of all. Not a chick flick . My husband said I wanna get this movie. Gotta start looking where to find it. With a matter of minutes I cked out Amazon. Bingo!

B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I enjoyed playing this game very much. I recommend it to people that like hay day and dislike seaside farm or whatever it's called. Hay day is also a pretty cool app( not available on kindle fire though.<br />:( )<br /><br />It's basically...<br />-farming (wheat, apples,etc...)<br />-saving heroes(tapping them out of a crystal)<br />-exploring legendary land ( not like.Alice and wonder land but like fairy flower land(.!?!?))<br /><br />-A trustworthy source
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Great series that is loosely based on some historical facts. Ragnar was a real person, but some of the things are &#34;historical hollywood&#34;. I love it, and recommend it. There is a good amount of violence and sex, so not for kids, but great for adults. If you like historical dramas, fantasy, adventure, or just good period pieces, it is for you.<br />Excellent set direction, amazing landscapes, great acting, overall a well done piece.
B003XVYLDU|4.0|Better than the movie. Billy Pilgrim, the main character, despite the ups and downs of his life, takes it all with a grain of salt.
B00GOQ9M4O|5.0|Intriguing use of symbolism in this series. This series is so heavy duty on so many levels that it almost defies analysis.  The &#34;dead&#34; arise amidst an Apocolypse; they wander the Earth as lost souls, consuming flesh.  It is from every religion's end of the world scenario. This episode with the Governor shows him being redeemed after walking the Earth alone for awhile, a semi-dead man himself, staggering into town appearing to be one of the Walkers.  He begins to find his humanity again from &#34;helping others,&#34; and a child's trust, innocence, is saving him from his own dark soul. If you do not get how literary this all is beneath the series I feel sorry for you because the entire program is a brilliant use of archetypal metaphors. They wander in the realm of the unconscious mind, they find their way out into the conscious mind's light, their own deaths and they are &#34;arisen&#34; against their will.  The unredeemed, the dead, consuming their fellow man as if a metaphor for how civilizations works now.
B008JFUS28|1.0|Very boring movie with nothing to root for and is as bland as it gets even with eye-popping CGI effects it just was flat. Didn't care about any of the caricatures passing for characters and the messy plot composed of basically &#34;just stuff happening&#34; was completely disconnected. Sorry to say I liked the first one better and I really didn't care for that one either but at least I got to see Thor fight a troll and some frost giants. Here he smashes a stone giant without breaking a sweat no threat no fuss no fun.
B003Y3ZTGA|5.0|Great song, great album, who doesn't love katy perry! what else can I say!  Everyone needs to listen to the whole album, every song is great..not just the #1's!
B003G4W49C|5.0|solid prose and a great plot twist. this was a fun read. i had to keep imagining the characters at the correct age. it was tricky to keep the correct imagery sometimes.
0679720200|5.0|I was given this book to read by one of my philosophy professors in 1976. This book is a little more than a short story and is easy to read and interpret. Albert Camus was an existentialist & wrote this novel to illustrate this philosophy.There are 3 main characters: Meursault is an Algerian. He is amoral; i.e.,indifferent to morality. I would even dare to say that he's nihilistic. Raymond is definitely immoral. He goes out of his way to commit evil. Marie wants to marry Meursault because his detached personality is appealing to her. Thus, her love for Meursault is based on feelings whereas Meursault merely loves her for sex. I will not spoil the book by revealing its ending, but will only say that the ending leaves the reader depressed and without hope. It reminded me of Nietzsche's view of the world-- that we are hurled upon the earth with nobody to rely on but ourselves, and that everything is absurd.<br /><br />I thought that I could write a better book that this, so I set out to do exactly that. It took 35 years before I felt confident enough to get started. During this time, I had collected thousands of books, as well as thousands of pages of articles and notes that I had written for various purposes. After 2 ½ years of arduous work, the book is completed & on its way to the publisher.<br /><br />My novel is called \\"LIFE AIN'T KIND\\" and will soon be available on Amazon & other websites. It is about a young violinist/pianist whose life is turned completely upside-down by unfortunate events. Is it a better book than \\"The Stranger\\"? I think so, and so do others. For one thing, \\"LIFE AIN'T KIND\\" is much deeper and contains considerable more knowledge. You won't laugh or cry while reading \\"The Stranger,\\" but you will with \\"LIFE AIN'T KIND.\\" You will also find the characters more like real people. You can find out more about this book at:<br /><br />[...]
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|A fun and easy read, Wonder is great book. Poignant and inspiring, it truly moved me, and at the end, I literally had to give it a standing ovation,
B000LXQVA4|5.0|Overall this is a great product. One of the safest and most entertaining jumperoos I could find. The only thing that kind of bothers me about it is music. I just wish that there was a bigger verity of it. It gets annoying fairly quickly.
B0042RJWTC|2.0|Not all the discs could be read- ultimately returned the set as it was unviewable as a whole. A shame since I enjoyed watching the series
B00ADQPB50|5.0|I was always a fan of Jessica Lange, but after seeing her characterization of Sister Jude, I am now a HUGE fan! Jessica Lange is truly amazing as she embodies such a complex and human character. James Cromwell was perfect as the evil doctor without a soul or a conscience. The story was riveting. As an added bonus, Evan Peters bared his beautiful buns several times.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|great game. runs flawlessly on the hd or hdx.. the first one has a little trouble however.. just too much to handle. otherwise awesome!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book held my interest throughout. There are well developed characters and an added device, for interest, is the changing point of view. Without giving away the plot I will say there are several unexpected twists. This writer is skilled in character development and I will be looking for other works of hers.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is like a hidden picture game. Accept with more levels and much more fun. Try this game and enjoy the fun.
6305212112|5.0|this is a classic movie I love, I am glad I bought it. I have added it to my collection and look forward to watching it again
B008JFUPK8|5.0|A great start to DC's new cinematic universe! Don't get me wrong, this movie had its share of flaws. But after 'Returns' and Superman not fighting anything, this was a great change to see the Man of Steel in Action. Great CGI!
6305657947|5.0|this is such a great mystery movie, the story is so full of twists, you cant take your eyes away for a second. it's got a lot of funny moments too which makes it even better
1401235425|5.0|Great story, excellent quality trade paper back Scott Snyder has really showcased Batman in the New 52. A must for any comic fan!
0783225725|5.0|this is another fine piece of work by clint eastwood. he rarely disappoints and that is especially true in this movie. If you've seen any westerns, they don't compare to this one, it sets the bar
B002M9WW30|5.0|Great overall set. Movies speak for themselves. (Except Rocky V) Quality and sounds on each blu-ray disc were spot on.
B000062XFG|5.0|great product and seller, I've found that this star trek series is very easy to understand and goes at a nice steady pace, not too slow or too fast. It has become my winding down program after a long day at work or before going to bed. I am very pleased with it
B00BPA2PBG|5.0|Ghostbuster has been reviewed many, many times. So I'll base my review on the 4K transfer. Comparing to the original blu-ray of the movie, this is a great upgrade. It was well were the double dip and anyone on the fence, def get the 4K remastered disc.
6304698798|5.0|this is a classic movie I love, I am glad I bought it. I have added it to my collection and look forward to watching it again
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Great app. Very convenient. You can place an order on the go with your phone or tablet. Its a free app.
B002NZK5VY|5.0|this movie is strangely addicting, I can't resist watching it. It seems weird to me because it's actually pretty cheesy, but not in an overwhelming way which is why I still watch it and will continue to watch it. I was very pleased with the product and the seller
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Fun to watch and its like the X-Files reborn, and Abrams keeps me guessing the whole time. I can't wait to watch the next season.
6305128952|5.0|great movie, I love movies like this, I am pleased with the product and the seller. I have added it to my collection
B00EP0KBXM|3.0|This movie was slow at the start and pretty much did not get going till it was almost over.Not one of the Smith's more notable movies, or is it &#34;Note to self DO NOT BUY&#34; yes I guess it is notable .
0439882826|5.0|Thanks my nephew loved it!!  Good shipping and a nice book. Funny star wars was back in my day but the kids still love it today!!
B00A0R42L6|4.0|I thought it was funny and the kids loved it. I still love the Romano, Leary , Leguizamo combination they have been doing for more than a decade now, and who could forget Scrat. I still love these timeless movies and always will.
B004SIP8W0|5.0|This movie remains one of my favorites!  It is a story of the human spirit.  Life is filled with tragedy and beauty.  This movie shows both beautifully.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|WOW, this was a dramatic action packed thriller from one end to the other. This may be the movie of the year and a stellar performance by Downey and Pearce who just rocked it from start to finish.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Very much enjoyed this book more than the last. Can not wait until the next book comes out. Great read.
0061950726|5.0|Another part of American History that I'd never heard of before.  Very interesting.  I'd love to read more stories that bring these kinds of situations to light.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham has done it again.  Couldn't put it down.<br />I liked the twists and turns.  Was great to revisit some of his old characters
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Love the characters in a new situation.  Race and the law in the south.  I did picture Mathew as the main character throughout the book!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I love this app! But... there are a few problems with it. I was using it and had got to level 4 when I turned it off and it went back to level 1 please fix this app so I can keep playing it !!!!
B000W8HC8I|1.0|A friend told me about the movie, Wolf of Wall Street which is premiering soon. After I looked it up, I found out there was a book. The book is almost always better, not in this case. It took me almost a month to finish this book because it sucked so much. However, the OCD in me cannot leave a book unfinished, but it was hell. The Wolf of Wall Street, (which I’m completely convinced was a name given to Jordan Belfort by Jordan Belfort to appear like some badass Wall Street Mogul). The book was poorly written and was all about his shenanigans with a bunch of wannabe losers who were all about drugs, hookers, and scamming people. How does one, who was stoned on ludes, cocaine, and a bunch of other drugs everyday write a book that’s 500 plus pages long??? And apparently, it was cut down. This book lacks substance and a lot of it wasn’t believable to me. And I found it completely annoying that he called his wife The Duchess of Bay Ridge. Jordan Belfort wants everyone to think he was this clever, brilliant financial mastermind, but mostly I was bored. I wish I could unread this book, that’s how much it sucked.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book always kept you guessing. Many plot twists that made it interesting. Wasn't expecting much when I bought it (it was only $2.99) but I was pleasantly surprised. Easily one of my favorite books and I am going to read the sequel Losing Hope. Would recommend this to anyone who likes a page-turner and a cute romance that touches on some serious issues.
0385523394|5.0|Loved this so much-  delicious details....sweetness of the soulful side of prison.  Such wonderful tales, well told.  Couldn't put it down.  Keep writing Piper!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Read the series I week. And I hated reading until this book came out. Even though  it might be the worst book in the series doesn't mean you should not read it. Highly action packed book with a few surprises on the way.  LOVE IT!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Such amazing characters you fall in love with them as their lives intertwine and unfold. Yet another masterpiece by Khaled Hosseini.
B000002UA7|3.0|So, I receive my CD and I'm excited to listen to it only to see the wrong CD in the case. Instead of The Whole Story I get Kate Bush's The Red Shoes Album. I was bummed to say the least, The only reason that I did'nt rate this transaction lower was due to the fact that I have enjoyed the album though it was not what I originaly ordered.
B00D3LA71K|4.0|Mud is well acted and interesting, with a terrific cast. I enjoyed the movie, but was a bit puzzled at times by the way everything played out. Was Mud an obsessed stalker or was he a little under-par mentally? Hard to tell, and the movie never quite realizes it's potential because the plot has some inexplicable scenes. I'm going to watch it again in a few weeks and see if this opinion changes any.<br /><br />Not a bad couple of hours of entertainment.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Fun game but a little complex. It seems to offer extended play time. I wish it had a relaxed search mode instead of the three minute timer found in most scenes.  Detail is good. Kind of hard to keep track of objectives.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I used to love and used this headphone all the time when it was $10 a piece available at every Target but what happened? Now it's discontinued from the normal distribution channel like Target, AND it's super expensive online (&#62;$50). Why would Sony make such popular headphones hard to get? I'm so disappointed and don't know what to buy as a replacement.
B000FC1MCS|4.0|I this is a great book for an insight into the minds of children normally over looked in our society.
0446556726|5.0|This was an excellent book!  I always love anything from Michael Connelly.<br />It kept me interested from the very first page.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|Only one thing that could have made it better: Include Portable Ops. Other than that it is truly the ultimate Metal Gear Solid Collection and is an absolute must-have for any MGS fan.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|This is a really boring game. It is a perfect example of &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;. Don't be taken in by the fact that it's free unless you want a truly mind numbing experience.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Authentic kindle cable.  Fits securely in the receptacle. Works great with my samsung phone too.  Shipped first class mail. Thanks for offering the product for sale.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book was interesting from page one right thru to the end. I love Khaled Hosseini's books. He is a fantastic story teller.
B00DYTKKGI|3.0|My daughter ordered this game for free, but you can't do anything cool unless you pay $2.99! Of course I paid. I doubt really think it was worth the purchase.
B002POVIMS|4.0|This is a really good driving tune! I would've given it a 5 but it needed to be a little longer!
B00E2RM3ZW|3.0|I am unable to say that I like this book because it is not meant to be liked; no character is particularly likeable and the deeds described are evil. The story follows a woman who somehow found herself the mother of a teenaged spree killer, as she tries in letters to retrace her story and see if the fault lay with herself, her husband or some other cause. Young Kevin was born without an emotional connection and his acts of calculated cruelty became worse until he turned from a sociopath to a psychopath. His mother, left alone to face the disgust of townsfolk, dutifully visits him in juvenile detention, wondering whether her middle-class home and running her business were to blame.<br />Shriver was pointing to the rash of spree killers in schools, asking why society was turning out these young men, and what is going to happen when people like Kevin come out of jail after serving his seven-year sentence - as a person under sixteen he could not be jailed for life.<br />Some have commented that the mother is using a very wide vocabulary - as an educated, travelled business woman, she would. The character's voice takes over when writing a book, especially in first person. I don't find the vocabulary stuffy, since this woman hasn't spent ten years studying the philosophers; it is Shriver's way of emphasising that this woman may not have loved her child but she tried to rear him well and not in a slum.<br />Today's disaffected youths are more likely to write viruses or set up pirate sites, but society still needs to talk about them.
B004JQN364|5.0|Little brother absolutely loved and I plan to buy more for him later since his into all of these. Thanks so much!!!!!!!
0307887448|5.0|I am completely in love with this book. It's got the best characters who are living in a world that is dreary and amazing at the same time. The story is infused with 80's pop culture which I love! I've read the story and have since listened to Wil Weaton's audio version and have gotten about a handful of others to read it too! I plan on using the names of the characters for any children that I may have, that's how much I love these characters!<br /><br />Anyway, buy the book...read it! And love it! &#34;It's on like Red Dawn!!!&#34;
B003M70O5O|5.0|uber addictive television...arrived late to the series, but watched the entire first season in two days, the trend continued with season 2
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Love! I already had an extended version of the Alien trilogy, but I bought this one because it was not only blu-ray, but it had soooo many extras!!! Very happy with this one!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It works perfectly as it is supposed to. My family has come to use the Chromecast to stream from youtube and netflix using the smart phones as a much more user friendly and convenient interface.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|THE SHINING is one of my favorite Stephen King books. So when I heard that Steve was writing a sequel some months back, I was looking forward to reading it, as I do all of King's books, but I found myself loving it once I got a few chapters into the book. Steve works in a lot of the highlights from THE SHINING, duh, but there was that right mix of verisimilitude. Danny has taken on some of his father's bad traits: excessive drinking, anger issues, but he seeks out help from AA, same as Jack. As with any King novel, characterization is what makes King such a huge success, and he doesn't disappoint us here. From Danny and his mother, to Dick Hallorann, to Abra Stone, to Billy Freeman, to Rose and the True Knot, just to name a few, King makes us care, then ratchets the tension, tighter and tighter, until the final showdown at The Roof O' The World where he gets assistance from someone from the past, but I dare not say and spoil it. And if you're also into audiobooks, Will Patton narrates the sequel. When I read that Campbell Scott wasn't reprising his role as narrator, I was very much disappointed, but Will did an amazing job. I'm often leery of sequels, but this one does not disappoint. A home run, in my eyes.
B004XZR63M|5.0|I love this book! It has helped me better understand the general system of finances and different points of view on money. I am reading his second book now and already bought his game. The game itself is a great learning tool!
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Both David's battle with Goliath and this book. Great read I enjoy Malcolm's ability to tell a sticky story. I'll read it again just to make sure I gleaned as much as I can......Thanks
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Does what it claims.  If you get a version that works, I would ignore the endless updates, as my original from amazon worked, follow-up update crashed; its update worked ok.  Still using that version & ignoring all the new builds.
B0085YOD1A|2.0|Used to work well giving me a nice widget to look at.  After a recent update the widget no longer updates so I can't really rely on it. Reinstalled and no change. Samsung GS4
B005LAIIMG|4.0|Love all zombie movies... this one was good but I think I wouldn't have bought it...<br />not sure if I would watch it over and over again like I do others.  It also came packaged well.
B00005OM4K|5.0|great update to my collection, replaces all my old vinyl. i saw them in 69 in ac, nj. great time.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|I absolutely love this app... but the recent update has made it impossible for me to play... I can't find the button saying update here!!! it might just be me..... it might not... I love the app but I can't play anymore... that makes me really sad...<br />I do suggest this app to everyone just the same...
B00E8S2GJI|4.0|The 3D is okay and so is the movie and I like the fact that the extended edition makes it a little longer but I actually thought they wouldn't pull a stunt like this considering they are making a three parter of one book! But anything to make money and especially making it a three parter! I think The Hobbit would be well received by critics if it wasn't a three parter! I know most movies of final books are turning in to two parters but this one is the first to be a three parter and also the biggest mistake! It should've been in one  barrel and be called The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey and the Desolation of Smaug! I know I am no professional writer or critic but sometimes being an amateur has its moments and for this one: a excellent notion!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Simply the best book ever. One of the best books I have ever read. It was clever, yet devastating. A great teenage book.
1451648537|5.0|Good book on many levels. Goofy brain, genius brain, wacky man, brilliant ideas. Stubborn, out of the box brain. The kid who annoyed everyone around him, but had the best ideas!<br />This is a good one to read if you have interests in business, creativity. If you lost a job, or are in a job.<br />I had to give it 5 stars
B002ZG99TA|5.0|Exciting movie and although disc was not new it was in great condition and I had no problems with it at all.  I wasn't prepared for some of the language or gestures but it was rated PG 13.  Nothing you don't see or hear on the streets all the time.
B004QOB8SO|3.0|I thought it a very interesting update on Sherlock Holmes but i prefer the older and slower kind of movie
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love this game! Quirky and fun bundled all into one. Great way to pass time in any place. Great family game as well!
B004132HZS|3.0|Still a very interesting update on an old story about Sherlock Holmes but I think it went a little too fast for me
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app so much! ive downloaded several others and this one is the best! I use this onvmy kindle fire and I love it.
B00CW6DAKC|2.0|At first I have this app a try cause it was free. Then I played it cause it was fun. However, this game doesn't explain itself very well as you play and now I need an update to continue play and no update is available. I put money into this game in order to continue play and now it won't let me. I'm very irate.
B00GFOIUVQ|3.0|The game itself is pretty fun, your typical melee fighting game. Some of the graphics keep bugging out, though. The basilisk scimitars and the fire monsters just look like static. Also, it's rather hard to unlock much of anything without spending money.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|This is a  good teen romantic film. Language is acceptable for young teens- a rarity these days. My daughter's new favorite movie.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|These game are absolutely amazing. Ico is an emotion generating lesson in art and cinema all done with almost zero dialog. A beautiful and well thought out puzzle platformer that leaves a more then lasting impression. However, this is no simple puzzle platformer, the goal is not necessarily to get your character across the obstacle, but to lead an interesting NPC named Yorda. Yorda comes when shes called, follows where she is lead by the hand, is afraid of heights and is constantly in jeopardy of being stolen away by strange black creatures.  The quality of the AI makes Yorda feel like she truly is alive, which only makes the thought of her getting carried off all the more threatening.<br /><br />  And Shadow of the Colossus, A game idea that has not yet been pulled off so wonderfully and solidly since.  Traveling through an immense, hand drawn, world full of jaw-dropping views and ancients structures, in order to find and slay 16 giant colossi . In order to find these colossi, as stated by a mysterious voice, one must \\"Raise thy sword by the light... and head to the place where the sword's light gathers... There, thou shalt find the colossi thou art to defeat.\\"(Shadow of The Colossus) then slay them by finding a way to climb up to there vital points and stabbing them. What more could you want! Not only that but done in the same mystifying subtlety that makes Ico such an experience.<br /><br />  The developers even put so much detail into these games that, on their original system the PS2, it wasn't all even visible with the current graphics. This HD version, which simply raises the resolution, allows the games look and style to only strengthen. Anyone who hasn't played these games, doesn't know what they are missing out on. And that is a true shame.
0545626382|5.0|My daughter and I both love this set.  I'm not much for violence, but so well written and captivating.  Due to the dystopia what other choice did these characters have but to defend themselves.  Can't wait to see all the movies to see how the imagery comes to life and enjoy it with my daughter.
B00CNQ7CRI|1.0|I loved Diary and both movies but Helen really phoned it in on this one. Headache inducing story line. The big question is not how it ends but why Bridget's children weren't taken away and why she's not in rehab.
1439153663|4.0|I thought this was a great book. I really enjoyed the way Grissom created the characters and the world they lived in. This wasn't a light read and there were a few tough parts but Grissom made me still want to know what happened to everyone in the end.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham is a master story teller.  This ended  with a healing that is greatly needed  ..Much can be learned.
B00FXEL00W|4.0|Had to keep reading...loved the storyline and the different characters keeping things moving without tunnel vision on Kendall and Payton. Looking forward to more in the future!
B00G4CXHSK|1.0|Lame, grindy platformer.  Basically just a platformer designed to become harder and harder so you need to grind or spend money to progress.
B0046B6X1E|3.0|Was a good movie to catch back up on.  Was good to see all the young actors, like Travolta.  My teenagers were impressed with how well the effects were done in the pre-CGI era.  I didn't recall the amount of nudity in this movie, right at the very start, which made for a shock moment with my kids.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's fun to find clues to help you open doors to the next level. Have a pen and paper to help you remember the Color and number sequences. I liked it and recommend this game.
B004CT5GOU|5.0|This doll house is adorable! We could not be happier with it. It is perfect for our four year old. She is thrilled with everything about it. She loves that she can play with her barbies in it too.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's a pretty good game, but I went through the levels really quickly. Decent graphics as well. Hoping for an update soon.
B008NNNF7G|5.0|I'm new to this band. I am head over heels in love. Going to see them February 2014 in Boston, can't wait.
B001DRF84W|1.0|Let me preface this review with the fact that I both love Marvel Comic and Comic Book films in general, so my review of this film is not based in a general dislike of the genre.<br /><br />I just don't even know where to start. I do give Ang Lee credit for trying to be different and approach this film differently than most directors would. That being said, I am not sure if I have ever seen such a horrible mess of bad acting, bad writing and bad directing this side of Battlefield Earth.<br /><br />First off the graphic technique with breaking up the screen into little &#34;comic book&#34; sections at times was just annoying and for lack of a better word &#34;unimaginative&#34;. This just seemed like what some D level director would think of, lets see, &#34;Hmmm..comic book story lets break up the screen like a comic book! No one will see that coming!&#34; Just awfulness at its worst.<br /><br />The whole thing with Bruce's father and all the psycho babble was just like a toothache. Really? Nowhere in the universe of Hulk comics did this ever come up. When I saw this in the cinema the first time I was actually embarrassed for Hulk fans. And the scene where they were sitting opposite of each other sharing their emotions was one of the most truly awful things I have ever seen on the big screen.<br /><br />What ever this film was it wasn't the Hulk, maybe ten minutes of it was the Hulk but it could have been one of the best ever with both the budget and resources it had.<br /><br />After seeing this film I was actually worried it was so bad that other comic book films would get cancelled mid-production or not made at all.<br /><br />If you want to see a good Hulk film watch The Incredible Hulk released in 2008. It didn't make up for the badness of this film but it does the Hulk justice.
0061733199|4.0|Great book. Tons of detailed, varied information. For a BOB, Id probably get the smaller version. Gets you into a survivalist mindset.<br />Consider accompanying this book with some on Wild edible and medicinal plants, Hunting and trapping, and basic anatomy/medicine/surgical procedures.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game....Amazon had some problems connecting to Facebook but have since corrected it...I was able to continue my candy crush addiction with the portability of my kindle fire....this game is simple, match like candies and meet different goals to level up. It is not easy, each level adds a level of complexity. Waiting and asking Facebook friends for lives gets old but the game sucks you in....I am on level 265 and  still love it :)
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Easy, small, convenient. Good price. Works for serrated knives, too. Not a primary sharpening tool, i think- but a must-have as a backup, and for edge touch-ups.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I thought it was a great ending to the series.  Roth never strayed from the rush of the other books; it ended in a way that served the characters well.
B00EH486AQ|4.0|the swords only lasted 2 days and the knee joint is a little busted but so far its a good figure.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES, GLAD IT FINALLY WAS AN APP FOR MY KINDLE FIRE!!  I GIVE IT A 5t!!
0887307280|5.0|ALL small business owners, freelancers and entrepreneurs need to read this as early as possible in their career. Can't recommend it enough.
B001OSIV62|5.0|My sister suggested I see this movie.  It took me a while to actually watch it and now I wish I had seen it sooner.  I like movies that are about real people and real events.  This had both along with original footage.  It reminded me quite a bit of the movie Senna the race car driver.  A movie in a documentary format.  I remember when he walked between the two towers but I never knew the history and his drive to realize his dream. Excellent movie in all respects. For anyone who has a dream, as far fetched as it may seem, this movie shows the passion, drive and determination to realize that dream.
0345803507|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the entire trilogy, finishing all 3 books in three weeks time. These novels were a great escape for me. I fell in love with the characters and the intense love story. Was this the greatest book written of all time? No, it will not be held next to Nabokov novels in the least however, it is a great read. It's a fantasy world. I'm not understanding the comments I'm reading from people bashing how whimsical and &#34;unrealistic&#34; this novel is. It's a NOVEL not a biography. The fact that the story is so over the top is what makes these book what they are. I'm sure every woman dreams of living this life in some way shape or form. E.L. James does a great job of holding true to what falling in love is about (with a wicked twist); but still keeping it so that the readers are kept in this imaginary bubble of fantasy. I sure hope James is penning the 4th novel as I write this review...
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Soo cooool it's so epic that it's too cool mortal localhost lis is like this game because of finish him
B001NLKT60|4.0|Try creating the most sympathetic character ever, and then rape her, expose her and shoot her in the face. It should have been a reeeaaallly long book, but it turned into a trilogy. Can't be helped, the author can no longer respond to comments from his editor. Ah well, still a good read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I found this one better than the second, although the second book is worth the read. In the beginning I was laughing out loud, as I found her \\"subcouince\\" very funny in this book, and mid way through I was crying so much I had tissues all over the place! I can relate to her on so many levels, trying to love the broken man, and pulling him through his sorrow and heartbreak.<br /><br />When everyone was gushing about this book (even my daughter) telling me I should read it, I had no interest and my reply to anyone who brought it up was \\"I'm not into porn books!)<br />But 5 days ago I was playing on my kindle when a station on tv was talking about the casting for the movie. So I looked it up and read about it. I thought I would go ahead and download it and try to read it. And I'm more than happy I did!<br />The last five days I haven't gotten much sleep because I could not put it down! I finished one book and download the next immediately!<br />This is not just a kinky sex book! This is an unconventional (in my opinion) love story of two people trying to find their way together, loving the unloveable! I love all three books and would recommend them to anyone!<br />Happy reading!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love playing this solitary card game. It is challenging. Keeps me occupied. And is entertaining. Easy to learn to play.

0399157573|5.0|Patricia Cornwell has written a murder mystery shrouded in a highly suspenseful story. Her usual characters are all on stage: Kay Scarpetta, her husband Benton Wesley, her niece Lucy, and Marino, a cop who used to be her investigator. Each of these characters brings interesting points of view to Cornwell's work. Sometimes they work well together while at other times are fighting like cats and dogs.<br /><br />In DUST, the murders in Newtown, Connecticut are on their minds. Scarpetta has performed the autopsies on the children whose lives were lost there and has come down with a fierce case of the flu. In the meantime, Marino seeks her out to see if she is up to viewing a dead woman sunk in mud. This will be the first body Scarpetta actually sees for herself in this new series of murders. The victim is Gail Shipton and was involved in a high-profile lawsuit. Displayed on a sports field belonging to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she is nude, except for a pair of underpants. She is covered in a white bed sheet, and her arm is situated so that it looks like she is posing for a stylized photograph.<br /><br />Shipman is not the first woman murdered and presented to the world in this way. A group of three were found in Washington, D.C.; they all disappeared before they were killed. In the beginning, as the investigation slowly gets into motion, no one seems to have any idea who might be the perpetrator of these crimes. But as time passes and Scarpetta is in touch with other autopsy experts, she finds some interesting similarities in the way the dead women are presented to the public.<br /><br />Wesley's colleagues do not agree with his assessment of the killer (who he describes as being “a violent sexual psychopath with narcissistic and borderline traits. The ritualistic way he captures, controls, and kills...takes the place of sex with them”), and his boss Ed Granby is the most verbal and vindictive against him. Wesley is convinced that this deranged manwill be responsible for getting him out of the BAU, the profiling part of the FBI. Granby thinks Wesley is an anachronism and should be let go. His priority is terrorism.<br /><br />While Scarpetta is home sick, she takes out her dog, Sock, one night and sees a male figure run away from her house. She can’t see him clearly but is convinced that he is stalking her the way the murdered women were stalked. She decides to call Marino and have him take her to the office so she can begin the autopsy: &#34;I need the body to talk to me because it will tell me the truth in a language that makes sense and can be trusted. The dead aren't capricious with me.&#34;<br /><br />As always, Patricia Cornwell gives her readers enough clues and red herrings to keep them guessing until the end. DUST is a long novel filled with many characters who get more than enough space  to do their thing. The ending winds down the story in a gracious and comely way. Fans will not be able to put the book down, and newcomers will find themselves in a new world of crime fiction. Don't miss this one!<br /><br />- Barbara Lipkien Gershenbaum

0316322407|5.0|Like most Americans, I had never heard of Malala Yousafzai until the horrible news story of October 2012, which reported that a young Pakistani girl had been shot in the face by the Taliban because of her activism for girls’ education. Over the next few days and weeks, we learned that she had been moved to England for treatment. More recently, she was in the news again as a nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize. Yet her fascinating autobiography shows us not only the brave and committed activist, but also a fun-loving girl who loves to win at school, fights with her brothers, and is devoted to her family, homeland and Muslim faith.<br /><br />The prologue is a brief description of the day of the shooting. The family was aware of threats against her life and her father’s life, but Malala says she doubted they would really attack a school girl: “Like my father, I’ve always been a daydreamer, and sometimes in my lessons my mind would drift and I’d imagine that on the way home a terrorist might jump out and shoot me on those steps. I wondered what I would do. Maybe I’d take off my shoes and hit him but then I’d think if I did that there would be no difference between me and a terrorist. It would be better to plead, ‘OK, shoot me, but first listen to me. What you are doing is wrong. I’m not against you personally, I just want every girl to go to school.’”<br /><br />Malala’s story begins with the day of her birth and the family and culture into which she was born. Although traditional Pashtuns don’t celebrate the birth of daughters, her father was different. He named her after Malalai of Maiwand, the greatest heroine of Afghanistan, and asked friends to throw dried fruits, sweets and coins into her cradle, something that is usually reserved for boys. We learn about the history of the Swat Valley, which became part of Pakistan in 1947 when the British gave India independence and divided it into two countries. We also learn of its beauty: “We have fields of wildflowers, orchards of delicious fruit, emerald mines and rivers full of trout.” Malala’s father started a school in Mingora, the largest city in the Valley: “He believed that lack of education was the root of all of Pakistan’s problems.” Malala’s mother started school at age six and quit the same term. Her father didn’t even notice.<br /><br />“I was ten when the Taliban came to our valley. Moniba and I had been reading the Twilight books and longed to be vampires. It seemd to us that the Taliban arrived in the night just like vampires.” Soon her father was under pressure to separate boys and girls in his school, and he complied. Then came the advice to have only women teach the girls. In the valley, most of the news came via radio, since many had no TV or were illiterate. A man named Fazlullah started a radio program, introducing himself as an Islamic reformer and interpreter of the Quran. Fazlullah became known as the Radio Mullah, and the edicts grew: “Within six months people were getting rid of their TVs, DVDs and CDs. Fazlullah’s men collected them into huge heaps on the streets and set them on fire, creating clouds of thick black smoke that reached high into the sky.”<br /><br />The tension and pressure built as the Taliban gained power in the Swat Valley, and day by day some people, like Malala’s family, resisted and ultimately paid a very high price. As I read this fascinating book, I marveled at how much history this young woman has seen and now shared with us. A moving story in its own right, I AM MALALA also provides a framework for the bits and pieces we hear on the news. Just a few days ago, the hardliner Fazlullah was elected leader of the Pakistan Taliban, endangering peace talks between the government and the Taliban. Meanwhile, Malala and her family are exiled in Birmingham, England. I hope, as she does, that someday she can return to the country she loves and make a difference.<br /><br />- Eileen Zimmerman Nicol
B00371XIJE|3.0|Good and bad. Kind of drags for the last 1/3 of the movie. It's not bad but definitely drags some.
1936594528|4.0|It is a truth universally acknowledged that a work of art in possession of a good reputation must be in want of a new version.<br /><br />That paraphrase of the first line of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE--- the novel turned 200 this year --- suggests that no masterpiece is safe from modernizing hands. In this case, Remake Fever meets Jane Mania in the guise of The Austen Project, HarperCollins’s plan to issue updates of her six celebrated works. Joanna Trollope’s take on Austen’s first published novel, SENSE & SENSIBILITY, kicks things off. (Other writers who have been signed up so far include Alexander McCall Smith, Val McDermid and Curtis Sittenfeld.)<br /><br />Reader, I must confess that I’m skeptical. Is this a creditable literary experiment or a marketing gimmick? I quote the excellent pre-publication commentary of journalists Sam Leith (pro) and Elizabeth Day (con) in The Observer last month: “Writers always exist in dialogue with their predecessors,” Leith reminds us. “Shakespeare nicked his plots from Holinshed and Chaucer from Boccaccio.” Day opines, more cynically, “These novels have been commissioned because the publishers know that if you slap ‘Austen’ on the cover, any book is guaranteed to be snapped up quicker than a bosom-enhancing gown on the day of the Netherfield ball.”<br /><br />One thing is sure: Trollope’s version requires a certain reorientation on the reader’s part. If you’re familiar with the book and/or have seen the Ang Lee/Emma Thompson film, you probably envision the female characters in bonnets and high-waisted muslin dresses, quaffing tea, sketching. Now you have to picture them wearing jeans, hunched over laptops, checking Facebook. Nothing could say update as clearly as the cover of this SENSE & SENSIBILITY, with its two cameo-like silhouettes in profile, complete with earbuds.<br /><br />Here’s a quick recap: Upon the death of Henry Dashwood, his wife and three daughters (Elinor, Marianne and Margaret) are banished from their family home,Norland, because of that hoary old plot device, primogeniture. The heir is Henry’s son by his first wife, John, and his disagreeable wife, Fanny. A Dashwood cousin, wealthy Sir John Middleton --- who has a great Downton Abbey-type pile of his own --- rescues the family from homelessness with a pretty rustic cottage. His mother-in-law, Abigail Jennings, a compassionate busybody, also becomes an ally. Suitors appear: Fanny’s brother, Ed, seems made for elder sister Elinor, while delicate, asthmatic Marianne is swept off her feet by dishy John Willoughby (Wills). Waiting hopefully in the wings is Colonel William Brandon, a kind and honest “older” fellow --- all of 35 --- who has turned his stately home into a center for substance abusers.<br /><br />Wisely, Trollope does not constantly call attention to the contemporary setting. Some of her sentences are gently Austenesque (“However detestable Fanny had made herself since she arrived at Norland, all the Dashwoods were agreed that she had one redeeming attribute, which was the possession of her brother Edward”), but she doesn’t lay it on too thick. Nor does she succumb to the trap of making Austen’s characters so modern in their opinions that they are unrecognizable. There are a few quasi-feminist moments, to be sure:  Elinor tries to persuade Marianne to think of her future in terms of an independent profession, not an attachment to “some guy you hardly know.” And again, when 14-year-old Margaret asks plaintively if girls have to make the opposite sex “their whole world,” Elinor replies, “No, if it doesn’t suit us to.”<br /><br />Marianne and her mother, on the other hand, are unrepentantly romantic (Marianne regards herself as “only half a person” in her boyfriend’s absence), and most of the female characters are ardently marriage-minded. Indeed, Trollope keeps her book so tasteful, authentic and respectful of the original that from time to time I forgot which century we were supposed to be in.<br /><br />Maybe it’s too respectful. Trollope’s own best novels deal with family and village life: the humble blessings and small, terrible defeats that rule our days. Her two greatest strengths, in my view, are the complexity and likability of her characters and the ambiguity of her endings. But, faced with the task of channeling Jane Austen, she pretty much is forced to make the two older sisters poster children for sense and sensibility. By the same token, Bill Brandon is virtuous, John weak, Fanny wicked, etc., etc. Trollope’s gift for rounded characters is stymied by the assignment, as is her resistance to tidy conclusions. This SENSE & SENSIBILITY ends the way Austen’s did, with everyone suitably partnered.<br /><br />Moreover, Trollope is not a natural wit and acerbic social observer like Austen. She does go in for a little satire. The horrible sisters Lucy and Nancy Steele --- who are like the evil twins of Elinor and Marianne --- say things like “Totes amaze” and “Fabby,” and Ed’s snobbish, small-minded mother is a typical Austenesque romance-squashing dragon lady (think Lady Catherine de Bourgh in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE). But the sharp, unsentimental assessments of property and personality that make Austen’s work so brilliant don’t have much of a presence in this remake.<br /><br />And why should they? Trollope isn’t writing BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES; she is trying to retain the essence of Austen’s book while ushering the plot into our own timeframe, and she does a more than satisfactory job. Her intention is clearly to emphasize the continuity between young women’s emotional life then and now rather than work the obvious contrasts. “You’re like those nineteenth-century novels where marriage is the only career option for a middle-class girl,” Mrs. Dashwood says reprovingly to Mrs. Jennings. Unruffled, Mrs. J. answers, “People pretend things have changed, but have they, really?”<br /><br />The new SENSE & SENSIBILITY may not approach the genius of Austen’s novel, but it is a worthy companion. Trollope, in fact, says she hopes that her retelling will inspire readers to seek out the original --- which you can buy as an eBook on Amazon for a mere 99 cents.<br /><br />Thrifty Elinor would approve.<br /><br />- Kathy Weissman
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love it 💕 big fan of all the books bug this book is definitely better the second time around 👍
B00G2SIW7M|3.0|I chose this rating because it's obvious this band is signed with a real record company and it's changed the music they write today. This album was boring and half-hearted.
B008KRBTU0|3.0|Cards are decent, come with instructions and suggestions.  Bottom of the tin has a sticker that informs you the product was made in China, but does not have toxic materials, etc.<br /><br />Upon opening the product and looking at it... I felt a little underwhelmed.  I mean, I knew what I am getting when I ordered.  But I can't help but feel that for the price... Maybe it's a bit expensive at MSRP $13.  You'll look at it and think, \\"I could make this with 3x5 cards\\".  Which is true: you could.  But you'd be using up a lot of your own time and end up with something on 3x5 cards.<br /><br />But the price point it is set at makes you really consider that cheaper alternative.  And when you consider it is manufactured in China... look, the production costs aren't high.  And it's pretty clear those savings aren't being passed on.<br /><br />The product itself is fine, but 3 out of 5 stars describes my feelings or level of happiness with the purchase.
B005LAII3U|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I never saw the original, and being 25, have been told by those older than me that this movie is a joke. Well, too bad, this movie knows its audience, which are people in my age group and I think it touches on all the right notes!
B004EPZ07K|4.0|Yes, it has a light comic side and has some predictable and cartoonish sequences but it works.  It has the feel of a Saturday matinee film meets cool special effects.  I enjoyed it for what it was - a superhero with an attitude.
0375869026|5.0|I am a ten year old boy in fith grade.I love this book because you have to wonder what August a deformed fith grader looks like.I think August is a nice kid and I hope there will be a second book about him.
B00B8R1NP0|4.0|Enjoyed the book but I never read how the killer was able to get into the victims homes without anyone hearing him.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Colleen Hoover already earned reputation that she knows how to write a good romance story with her novels Slammed and Point of Retreat. My first encounter with her is Hopeless, first book in her new contemporary romance series, about hopeless boy and girl who somehow manage to find love together.<br /><br />Seventeen-year-old Sky is not the usual heroine. She’s got a reputation of being a slut, is home-schooled and lives with a mother who is against technology. Yes that means no tv, phones, computers etc. Sky at first glance is definitely not someone who I could easily connect or relate to. But very soon she earned my admiration and respect, mostly thanks to how she reacts to slut-shaming directed at her. It’s always good reading about a strong, self-confident character.<br /><br />Although she had a lot of relationships, Sky is cold and distant toward the boys. They do not faze her. That is, until she meets Dean Holder. When Sky looked at him, she never wanted to stop. And when Holder looked at her…<br />&#34;There was something so disturbing about the way he looked at me. It was uncomfortable, embarrassing, and somehow flattering all at once.&#34;<br /><br />A list of reasons why Sky should not be attracted to Holder is mile long. He’s got a temper, he’s moody, he’s full of secrets… But still, everything about him feels right. If you liked the instant attraction and intensity of romance between Romeo and Juliet, if you liked the drama of Beautiful Disaster, then Hopeless is going to rock your world.<br /><br />&#34;He’s touching my face. His hand is on my cheek. I can’t think, I can’t speak, I can’t breathe. The intensity that exudes from his whole existence sucks the air out of my lungs and the strength out of my knees.&#34;<br /><br />At first, I was swept by the emotions and romance between Sky and Holder, but as the story developed and secrets from their past started to get revealed, the story kinda went downhill for me. It all seemed sounbelievable, like a plotline of some telenovela. But I think I will be a lonely black sheep in my little corner, since this book is insanely popular and has 4.51 rating on Goodreads with 76.124 reviews.<br /><br />IN THE END…<br />Hopeless is one of those contemporary romance stories full of drama that will make you tingle with the intensity of emotions. If you don’t mind your book to be crammed with teenage hormones and to be a little bit over the top, I think you are going to enjoy it. Think of it like a cocktail of dramatic flare from Beautiful Disaster and deeply-flawed characters from Pushing the Limits.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was given a free eBook by the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for a honest review.
B00EMGUT1I|5.0|Lemmy, Phil and Mikkey put together their best album in years with &#34;Aftershock&#34;.  Even the couple of slower songs are catchy as hell and really pace the flow of the album.  Needless to say, Motorhead knows what their core audience wants and brings out the heavy guns for most of the record with tracks like &#34;Going to Mexico&#34; that simply kick ass.  The cherry on top?  Buying it through Amazon gave me downloadable MP3s as well as access vis their &#34;Cloud Player&#34;.  So you get a physical copy, digital copy and a streaming copy for one price.  WOW!
B00GBCMW9S|1.0|This is not about the album...it is about Amazon's downloading of mp3's being ruined with their new cloud player.  I can't get the music to download or export to itunes...thanks to the &#34;new and improved&#34; amazon cloud player that is holding my music hostage.
B00EE9A8OQ|5.0|a back to the &#34;Alice in Hell&#34; days. The first song songs just like &#34;Schizo's are not alone&#34; from the first album, just a touch of the new Dave Padden musical style, which is an outstanding vocalist. Not a disapointment here.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book reminded me of THERES SOMETHING ABOUT KEVIN by Shively, with more legalese and less parental guilt.  It is a page turner
B00F8OUBXE|5.0|One of the greatest metal band's of all time. Even though I like the &#34;Mike Howe&#34; era, this album has very close similarities to that time. It is a welcome album to the old roots. Not a dissapointing band and surely not a dissapointing metal album.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Complex, and gripping tale..Well drawn characters and multiple plot twists keep the action moving along while the richness of detail creates a vibrant an enveloping atmosphere.
B000002H6C|5.0|I think I was in 4th grade when this album was released.  I vaguely remember that Metallica had been nominated for a Grammy or some other award, and that at the show they were to perform a song.  However, I don’t remember much more than that.<br />Metallica was really just starting to gain in popularity with this one.  This was when they still had something to prove.  In my opinion, they proved themselves to world fully with the black album.  After that, there was nothing left to say.  Load and Reload where after the fact, superfluous and not necessary.  Over Metallica’s first 5 albums they proved they play beyond a reasonable doubt.  They proved that their names belonged to the ranks of musicians that have influenced the world in the same way Beethoven has, even though there are bands that are better than Metallica.<br />S&M was a silly little ditty, though that is generally considered to have bridged the gap between metal and classical music, I, personally, find that idea hilarious.  If you are a classical musician, and can’t hear the talent on Metallica’s early albums like this one, then I would question your credentials.<br />First, and foremost, if you don’t like most metal, I might suggest that you give this album a try.  It is really one of those albums that almost anyone should be able to appreciate.  For example, try listening to the song, “One.”  You shouldn’t need any help from a lyric sheet.  Sure the vocals do have some rasp, but only to the extent of adding flavor in a tasteful way.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great video.  3 different levels.  So you don't get bored with same old video week after week.  I've been lifting weights and doing a short run a couple days a week for years.  This video was actually difficult!! I loved it! It used different muscles than I was used to using.  And the continuous weights instead of just a set at a time is tough.  Again, I'm loving it.  And I love that it's only 20 minutes.  I can find 20 minutes in my morning to get this done, but was having a hard time finding an hour for my other routine right now.
B000NYT1M6|5.0|My son goes nuts for his dump truck.  You can really dump the load and open and close the doors to put men inside.
B008133MDK|5.0|Probably the best show on TV these days (when it is actually on). Smart and funny dialogue, tight pacing, well-developed and likeable characters, excellently acted. What's not to love?  If only all show producers could pull this off.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Works great with YouTube but casting videos playing in Chrome browser is terrible. Already have a Roku for other streaming content so I pretty much only use this for YouTube.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Yes, it is a fun game, however on some levels it is not possible to complete/finish unless you buy the extra power items..just saying how it really is!  Don't think I'm the only one in this situation.
B003AMEWMW|5.0|This is an exceptionally well performed and directed movie -- typical of the Coens (including Frances McDormand).  I had seen it twice before ordering it.  I recommend it to anyone with whom I get into conversation about movies.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|To much time is never good! Enjoy what God gives you and do something that makes a difference for The Kingdom.
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|This was a Great Buy - made even better when the price dropped lower than the pre-order price I purchased under (Amazon credited the difference).<br /><br />5 stars for the movie, plot, updated special effects, and acting! Kudos to the great cast. This is a Great, Serious &#34;Adult&#34; telling of the Superman tale, with NO Campiness! (Although, I will always have nostalgically fond feelings towards Christopher Reeves' and George Reeve's Superman that I grew up with.)  Special effects and beautiful visuals developed throughout were top notch - I especially liked the &#34;fly along's&#34; with Superman (Really makes Chris Reeve's wired fight scenes with Terence Stamp - Superman vs. Zod's team - Dated and awkward).<br /><br />5 stars for the Blu-Ray 3D transfer - enjoyed movie on my Optoma GT750E 720p Active HD3D Gaming / Movie projector and my DTS home theater setup.  Scaled up on a big screen, it was lots of fun and quite depth and scale immersive - But I would have loved some pop-out moments (there didn't seem to be many).<br /><br />4 stars for the fight scenes -- seemed to drag a little long sometimes.<br /><br />3 stars for Chris Nolan's choice of a muted color pallet!!  Compared to the photo on the case cover, colors were muted to ~80%.  I would have preferred James Cameron's crisp, bluish color pallet in Terminator 2 - Judgement Day.
B005ZOCF5E|5.0|One of my favorite hard SF writers. This is a great tale and I highly recommend it to readers who are looking to get off planet and explore our solar system.
B005VPRDAY|4.0|This is part of our Toys for Tots Christmas donation this year. We hope some young girl will enjoy it.
B00371XIP8|2.0|Love the first, sequal was comical in a very negative way.  Advice not to watch it and lower your opinion of The Saints.
B000091NO0|2.0|This album has its moments but it also has its moments.  This is the psychedelic circus that is everything that is good and bad and dumb about Prince.  The guy's a genius I suppose, but this album is where he apparently wants to shove it into our brains and stir it with an eggbeater.  Too much craziness and noise.  A melange of musical styles with no direction to carry the listener to satisfaction.<br /><br />We do get a taste of what makes Prince such a good musical artist.  However there is a self-indulgence to this over-produced album that screams out \\"Look at me!  Look at me!\\"  The show-off aspect of this raucous recording becomes more annoying than listenable.  The moments of beauty are over-shadowed by the three ring circus display of what do you do when you get a bunch of great players in a recording studio with a egotistical genius who wants to be sure everyone knows how talented he is.<br /><br />No matter how talented anyone on this album is, what you get is a mess.  That's what this album is to my ears.  Hardcore Prince fans will undoubtedly think differently.  But if you're not familiar with Prince, then I'm just sayin'.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|This amp truly makes a difference when using it with my ATH M50s and Beyers DT 770s! I usually leave it in the 'blue' preset, and music sounds so much better..<br /><br />Im getting about 7-9 hours of battery life, so I guess it's not that bad.
055358202X|5.0|I am rating it high b/c I love this series but I am also hoping that others will respond and help me!!!  I think this novel is slow and annoying.  am working on this book right now, and I'm having a really really hard time caring about it or connecting with it...Could use a spoiler, honestly, to get me thru this book.
B00C6Q3UNK|5.0|The doll is, oh beautiful, the material is strong and durable, this super thrilled my daughter is very good product. That apart from that amazon fulfilled fully with the order, which was received by me in Venezuela in very good condition. I am grateful for their services

B004ECDNJU|4.0|I wish there were more levels!!!!!!  The only thing I can do is up the speed to make it interesting again.
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|This character has such a fun voice. I read the other two books such a long time ago, that I'm not sure how this one compares but I enjoyed reading it.
0802473156|5.0|This book is very well written and easy to understand. Dr. Chapman guides you through the 5 love languages with details about each language along with stories and applications to each language. Even though this book is more for the married couples, it is still a very informative book and I viewed this book from the perspective of how I would identify the languages of love of my friends and family members.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|The boring and very conventional tale of the sexual awakening of a virgin by a more experienced man. Despite its sulfurous reputation, this book is just a stereotypical romance novel with a few explicit sex scenes. The story is not well-written, very cliché and the main characters have absolutely no personality.<br />If you're looking for erotic novels, you can easily find better ones!
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Totally fun ad addictive. Plus the childish theme makes it pure fun to play. And to top it off the unlockables are pretty hilarious.
0316219266|5.0|While some reviewers have complained that this book is biased and at times inaccurate, I found that the positives outweigh the negatives in this case. The author did come across as biting at times when it came to describing Bezos. Describing Jeff-bots, the tendency to tell the same story, the odd focus on his laugh, the eye-rolling recollections of 'jeffisms', and other things. But, overall, I think that the author did an excellent job of giving insight into a fascinating man and company.<br /><br />I won't go over everything the book covers, but one of the things I was struck by is just how much Amazon has changed everything. They are truly an innovative and disruptive company, and the main thing that I got out of this book was a reminder of just how much and how fast they have changed things. Innovations like customer reviews, one-click buying, Prime, and much more.<br /><br />The other thing I will point out is that the author spends a couple of chapters talking about how big of a bully Amazon can be when they want to take over a sector, and how they use the Marketplace to hurt smaller sellers. I have no reason to doubt that much of that is true . . . with a big company, that is bound to happen in some form. But the other side of it isn't covered as much - Amazon has also enabled thousands of small businesses to get started and succeed, including mine. I own a small publishing company that would not exist without Amazon. I'm convinced that Amazon has created something that helps to level the playing field for our authors and helped create other jobs and businesses that other corporations just haven't. Some of the corporate behavior is distasteful and even disturbing, but its important to look at the whole picture.<br /><br />Great read, very informative, and a window into a company that will continue to grow and influence our lives for years to come. Highly Recommended.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great game app! I recommend this game app to those who are into simulated games. You will not stop playing this game!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging but fun. Not a game if you're looking for a time filler as time flies quickly when you're playing.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Finally, found the best app for my tablet. The best game ever. Splendid graphics and unwatchable gameplay. The multiplayer mode is simply superb.
B003QP4BJM|5.0|A very good response to all the doom & gloom scare mongers and why they are wrong and have been so many times in the past.
B000W00FE4|5.0|A classic early 80's album. Not a bad song on it. I just picked up a nice used vinyl copy. Sex Dwarf must be one of the funniest and kinkiest songs on a mainstream pop album ever. Say Hello, Wave Goodbye always moves me even though I must have heard it 100 times.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|I just can't stand an app that says free, and then includes charges so you can play as you please.<br /><br />I uninstalled it before I even tried to play.  I cannot stand this tactic... is is really bait and switch.  I just would like them to be truth full with the whole story.... other wise ... I consider them deceitful and will not reward their tactics by purchasing anything from them.

1623431182|4.0|I bought this calendar because I love this photographer, and I needed a small calendar.  While I love the photographs, I'm taking off a star for a few reasons.  First of all, the description says that there are four bonus months of September-December 2013.  I thought that this meant that there would be four extra months with pictures, but it doesn't.  That just means that on the inside cover, there is a printout of four months (i.e. 4 mini calendar grids), each a quarter of a page.<br /><br />Secondly, just keep in mind that the boxes in this calendar month are quite small.  The calendar is 7\\"x7\\", and each date box is 17/16\\" tall and 15/16\\" wide.  If you need to actually write stuff or put reminders (in my case, stickers) in these boxes, be aware that there isn't much space, though the description reads \\"daily grids still provide room for jotting notes, appointments, birthdays and reminders.\\"  If you need the calendar just to keep track of dates, then I think this compact calendar would work well.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This was witty and an excellent story to introduce the characters. I will watch it again and again and again.
B00F031XPS|5.0|What a great documentary. Lots of never before seen pictures and footage. A must have for any Hendrix fan. After the video I really felt the lose. Even after all these years you wonder, what might have been....
1423136802|5.0|Percy Jackson and the Olympians by Rick Riordan<br />One of my favorite book series by one of my favorite authors, the five books in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series are well worth the read. Riordan’s wit and and sense of humor are apparent even from the chapter titles. Just reading the table of contents makes one want to read them with vigor to find out why Percy “accidentally vaporize[s] [his] pre-algebra teacher” or why he’s hailing “the taxi of eternal torment”. As we follow the path of the boy who is arguably the most powerful demigod in existence the reader is drawn into his tale, the drama and intensity almost a backseat as one waits to discover what hilarious battle taunt Percy Jackson uses next. No fan of the series can forget when Percy angers the mother of all monsters by comparing her to an anteater or when he sagely advises the reader to take the subway to work because flying pigs are too dangerous. That’s not to say that drama and intensity are not apparent. No book with spies, back-stabbing allies, romantic tension, parent-child relation troubles, nation-wide manhunts and a new monster practically every chapter can be without drama. Riordan’s talent however, lies in balancing the two. Humor and drama are found in near equal bouts as the most realistically aged characters I have read about yet fight for the world until the very end. The best part about the series? Riordan is creating another one with many of the same characters so the adventure doesn’t end here. Needless to say I have re-read these books with fervor. The first one is taped together (which is why hard-back is better for books you love). The last thing I will say about this series is that it is not just for pre-teens. These books can be enjoyed by anyone who has a thirst for fantastical adventure or greek mythology.<br /><br />5 stars
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|A  book for our times that examines privacy concerns we all care about.  It is about absolute power corrupting absolutely.  It is also about love, trust, and caring.
0143119680|4.0|A Discovery of Witches by Deborah Harkness<br />Overall I was torn by this book. The biggest downside, I believe, is that the vampires are entirely too much like those created by Stephanie Meyer. This is fine of course, especially if you are a huge fan of Twilight, but I was disappointed that while both her witches and daemons were completely unique, her vampires were not. Beyond that however, the plot is captivating, the research amazing, and the characters memorable. Reading this book, I truly felt like I was living the life of Diana, the main character. This could be both thrilling and frustrating as this book is as much a mystery novel as it is a romance novel. I am quickly discovering that I have little patience for mysteries, I find it all together irksome not to know what’s going on, a feeling that is actually mirrored in Diana. My favorite bit about his book is the amount that Genetics plays a part. The biology aspects of this book that explain Diana’s powers and the reason she is so important fascinate me and it is my desire to someday know enough about the subject to use research in a very similar way, as a help to the plot to both teach the reader about the subject and try to capture their attention in new and special ways. In conclusion I would recommend this book highly, it is well written and the plot is both unique and entrancing, but I would warn the reader that it is indeed a romance novel, and a highly political and equality focused novel. I would not advise for readers under the age of 13 unless they are not bothered by dark themes like torture, discrimination, death (and hit-men), etc. I have yet to read the sequels, but I shall put them on my extensive list of books to read and look forward to seeing Diana learning about her powers and the work of the Conventicle.<br /><br />4 stars
B000HF0ISC|5.0|Great movie! In the top 10 of my favortire movies for sure! Has an awesome cast, even for the minor roles!!
B0054W4JQK|4.0|If you like a book that keeps you guessing and with a great twist then this is the book for you!
B001E6X4W0|5.0|Rewatched it, one of the best vampire movies IMO. A lot of stars in here that weren't big names when released.
B0037TPMOA|5.0|Fantastic!! This was the first Stephen King I read and I loved it. There were many times the hairs on my neck would stand on end and/or I had to look around to remember &#34;it's just a book&#34;. Great read - could not recommend it enough!
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Thought it was pretty good. I kept yelling at the screen &#34;stop drinking idiot&#34;. I have seen addiction firsthand, it takes over everything. This movie does a good job at conveying that.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love it ,I wish I didn't die cuz then I have to wait to get a new life ...like 30minutes!!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|its a fun game, but it should be a little cheaper. other than that, its rox the kat box! love it!
B000BTC5LW|4.0|The Pulse CD is my favorite Pink Floyd recording.  This is not the same concert - there are subtle differences in the performances, which was actually interesting to get another version.  I would have liked to have seen more close-up footage of the performers and less of the back-drop screen and the full frame view of the stage/screen/audience.  But I'm a musician and that's just my own preference/bias.<br /><br />I wish it had been available in BluRay, but c'est la vive.<br /><br />Sound quality is excellent.  Watching it now and trying to see if there are parts that were overdubbed because something caught my eye earlier that made me wonder...
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|They are back at their best. Could not put the book down. Only sorry I have to wait for the next.
B003B02OOG|5.0|This is a great compilation of stories by one of my favorite authors.  It was refreshing to read stories instead of a complete novel for a change.  Grisham is always a superb spinner of tales both novel length and short.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Best series of books that I have read in a while. Couldn't put the books down. Just wanted to read them all. Good to the very last sentence.  Will watch for more books to come.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is the best yet!  I really enjoyed the fact that many of the characters were also in A Time To Kill which I read years ago.  It says a lot about Mr. Grisham's talent as a writer that I remembered the characters.  It was like meeting old friends again.  Excellent and gripping story.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Okay, people need to stop complaining just because this amazing series did not end the way they wanted it to.  This is not their story to tell, it's the author's.  I was extremely sad as well when I finished this book.  It made me angry and upset; however, I think that is a normal reaction to losing a character you feel connected with and seeing the suffering of one as well. That does not mean that this book was not well written. It did have a few flaws. It felt rushed and forced at a few points, but overall I still think it was great. There's always so much to fit into a final book. I actually liked that the book was from the pov of both main characters though.  I know some didn't. This author chose to portray a realistic end to a story about revolution. which most authors are not brave enough to do.  I respect Ms. Roth for not taking the easy way out by trying to everyone happy and wrapping the story up nice and neat.  I think there are quite a few great lessons to learn from this book...and it is sad but true that you will often learn the most important lessons through pain, loss, struggle, and adversity.
0345803485|5.0|Excellent story.  E. L. James has told a nice love story.  She has developed her characters quite well.  Too many people have determined that this is just another dirty book.  I would beg to differ.
1574216988|4.0|This is a good book for a person wanting some inspiration and some examples to ad to the repertoire. There is truth to the idea of &#34;ZEN&#34; in this drawing experience.
B003E74B24|1.0|Don't usually write reviews but I have to say you would have to pay me a great deal of money to read a book written of about Gordon Ramsay! I have worked in, managed and owned restaurants and truly love this industry...He is an insult to this business! No on should behave the way he does in a restaurant or any business for that matter.  I hate that the public is seeing restaurants run like this!!  I don't care why he behave this way but he should show more self respect and more respect of his business!! I also understand he has kids....Does he want them to think it is alright to behave the way he does and to talk to others the way he does?
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|What more can I say?  This is the best game I've played in a long time.  I can bring it with me wherever I go.
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|This album is incredibly addictive. After I had listened to it a couple of times when I got it, I decided to to give it a break to see if the magic would hold after a couple of weeks. It turned out my admiration for the album just grew: and I just can't stop listening to the less obvious songs of the album such as fireside and i wanna be yours. Some may say there are songs that sound very similar here, such as one for the road and why d'you only call me when youre high, but I think that does not mar the accomplishment of the band in terms of melody and lyrics. And I also think Alex has made good use of the r&b influences and made it his own. This is the most accessible album of the band and I'm sure it will be a classic of the 2010s rock, just like The Black Keys El Camino.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|No one will ever top Stephen King.  How does he do it?  I truly do not know and will forever be a Constant Reader.
B0009P5YXO|3.0|Only needed it for one night.  Putting the batteries in is a little confusing.  The light craps out when you try to extend and turn it on.  Why does it have sounds unrelated to Doctor Who?  Why does it have dual functionality as a pen?  No one knows.
0385751532|5.0|The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a very interesting and emotional book. This book really brings to life some of the hardships faced by Jewish people living in Germany during World War II. Bruno, the main character find himself in an interesting position with one of the Jewish boys in the camp. They develop a relationship and begin talking. This book shows two young boys, one a Nazi an the other a Jewish boy in concentration camps. The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, is also a very tragic story. I really enjoyed how the author showed the characters emotions and brought the story to life. If I has to criticize this book it would probably be the ending, the author does specifically give us information, it is mostly open ended, but you can infer what happens. I would like it if John Boyne gave us a little more information. This book is one of the best books I have ever read. I would highly recommend it to anyone! Pick up a copy today!
B004LWZW24|5.0|Horror at it's Best, Yes A great Story Line an d A fab Ending, Will keep you pivoted to your seat from start to end.<br />Great.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie. It was a good telling of the story and will make for a good restart of the story.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|It's so descriptive and opens your eyes about the world.All the events shows how school effects the life of a teen.
B000T433CO|5.0|Yes, it is a &#34;feel good&#34; movie - one that exudes possibilities when we venture of our our shell.  A quirky take on remarkably common personalities and situations, with a trans-Atlantic twist. I truly enjoyed the interactions among the characters.  The leads were charming but never saccharine sweet. The 'bad guys' were flawed just enough to make me squirm.  Even the young girls were perfect in their roles (I don't want to divulge much of the plot).
B003ODIZL6|2.0|It needs to have a spot where you can type in the word so that you don't have to flip through every page of the dictionary to find the word you're looking for.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|A quirky mix of love stories weaved together by characters whose London-based lives are intertwined by friendship and jobs.  I especially enjoyed the interactions of widower and stepson, but all mini-stories were charming or charmingly nerve-wracking in their own right.  While the story takes place during a Christmas holiday season, its not a Christmas story - I enjoy it year-round.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Liesl is such a presence in this book with her craving for books. She steals her first book long before she can read. It is a book of exquisite love and tragedy and the pain of Nazi Germany. Fostered by people who were &#34;not in the party&#34; and harboring the son of a Jew who had saved Papa's life in WWII Liesl's story is told through the eyes of Death. Death is a truly fitting way to tell about this time. And Liesl who survives with an indomitable spirit.
B000FBFN0Q|4.0|I am sorry to say that the story dragged on and on.  If the whole book would have been as good as the lady 150 pages, it would have been wonderful.
0142407542|5.0|If you loved the Gruffalo, this is a MUST have!!! My 4-year really loved both. Great story and wonderful illustrations!

B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Eminem made another great album.  Is anyone surprised by this?  I am not, nor was I disappointed.  Great beats, great sampling, and great lyrics.  Not much more could be said.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Very entertaining and engaging while I was on a long flight to Hawaii. And on my Kindle, between my iPhone and iPad I could read it everywhere!
B005JABSB6|1.0|These glasses do not work with newer Sharp LED 3D Aquos Tv.  These are for LCD TV's and do not say so on the description.  However upon reading through the instructions there is information on this.  Instructions read as follows.  NOTE * These 3D glasses are only for use with Sharp LCD TVs supporting 3D.  There should be a better description stipulating that.  Will be sending these back and not happy.  Buyer beware if you have a newer Sharp Auqos LED 3D TV.  Right on the front of the instructions it says these model glasses are only for use with LCD TVs.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved the book.  I recommended to my book club.  I have loved all of his books.  I especially liked it, because it wasn't all based in Kabul.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|I was so happy to download this to my Kindle.  Have to re-read this book every 2-ish years.  Nice to have a copy handy.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Been playing for a couple of weeks now and really enjoy it. Great graphics and great time killer. Thank you
B00DHHWY9I|1.0|Horrible movie, I am sorry to say I had the displeasure of watching this boring excuse of a movie. Stay away from this garbage,
B0070Z4M4I|1.0|This film is complete garbage.  Aside from the improved special effects, this film adds nothing to John Carpenter's vision of horror from 1982.  So much potential wasted on this entirely dissapointing prequal to one of my favorite horror films of all time.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Have read every one of Patricia Cornwell's books in the Scarpetta Series.  Some of them several times. One of my favorite authors.

B005CRQ3IE|5.0|Very entertaining! So many new creatures, and it's a great way to keep the wizarding world alive for us all.
B00F880BWG|4.0|I bought this because my dvr didnt work and i wouldnt be able to continue the fourth season.  Great quality.
B00B8R1NP0|1.0|this book was really very poorly written - almost comical at times, it was so bad.  i will not read this author again.
0553593714|5.0|This book took a while to ship, but it was well worth the wait. This book is a must read for every reader. I am hooked on the collection and will order from this seller every time!
B009C7JS14|5.0|This app is awesome and it works without Wi-Fi. Which is great when you're on a road trip. So go and get this app
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I love white noise sounds. Especially the crickets. Reminds me of the summers spent at my grandmas. Peaceful and calming. Worth the money.
B0088EDMMS|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. Bette Midler is spot-on in this role. The blu-ray is bright and clear. Disney did good with this one, not just a Halloween movie but one that can be enjoyed anytime.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I found the beginning a little confusing--It took a little while for me to fully understand how all of the characters and stories were intertwined. Once that became a little more clear to me I really enjoyed it. It makes you think about some of the \\"what if\\" possibilities in life and fate.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Am a trekkie so how could I not love this movie. Spock is great and I love Bernard Cumberbatch. The colors and great and this blu-ray edition super clear.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|This is an excellent show. Wonderful writing. The premise lets the writers explore many subjects that are relevant to the issues of the day.
B00B3L3RPA|3.0|The book is good--we all know that. This edition lacks page numbers, which makes it difficult to navigate or site in a paper.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|It was amazing that the show could get even better. The acting, the writing, and the styles all coincide to make a great series. You are going to get hooked on this show!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I would have given this app 5 stars except that I've had to remove it from and reload it on my Kindle Fire twice in the last two months when it froze during use.
B005PK57IK|5.0|This season is tremendous. Do not miss a minute of it. Excellent acting and writing.. You will be mesmerized by the interwoven plots.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Great book with good twists and turns. Enjoyed ending with the looking forward what ifs. Also was a quick read
B00FHB7398|5.0|I truly love this game. The price was just right. A loved the bonus level. I hope they develop more games like this one.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Great album.  I knew about Radioactive and bought this for my wife.  But I find myself listening to the free MP3 album on repeat more often than not.
B005LAIIJY|1.0|Racist tones. Judge for yourself. Or better yet, do not support this type of film. I would never let a child watch this movie. Lot's of killings
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Just a great album.  I bought it for my wife but listen to the free MP3 album all the time.
B00GH4R95C|2.0|This movie was bad.<br />I could end this review right here but why would I?<br />This movie is a mess, it attempts to deliver an origin story for Superman but the problem is that we never connect to Clark as a character. The first chunk of the movie takes place on Krypton, a location that in all honesty doesn't matter because it explodes, the only reason Krypton is shown is because A) Avatar was popular, let's show an Avatar-esque world and B) Thor was popular and that took place in part in an alien world so let's show another world's culture. The problem was this is a Superman movie and at the 30 minute mark we still know nothing about Clark.<br />In fact even by the big moment in the movie when Clark flies for the first time we have a problem in that we still don't know who Clark is as a person. We saw him as a child, and we see him get punched and then destroy a trucker's livlihood in retaliation, so we know two things: Clark wants to save some people and Clark is petty. The next problem is that his father sent him from Krypton so he'll have a choice, but as soon as he meets his father's ghost he says something to the effect of \\"this is what you should do.\\" So Clark then has no choice.<br />Ok got it.<br />So at no point in the movie do we get to see Clark as a person, he's an emotionless beast who does nothing and even when he does show himself he's simply too cocky to have any personality other than that of a jerk. Who then is the main character? Is it Amy Adams? Well I mean she is the one we learn the most about but even she is barely deveolped as a character, instead she somehow is brought into any and every situation for no reason.<br />So here's the next problem. Superman gets his power from earth's atmosphere right? The Kryptonians get their power from Earth's atmosphere. Why then can these characters jump far and run fast even when they have their suits on? It's the atmosphere but that only gives them xray vision and laser eyes... Why then do they want to terraform earth? Wouldn't they want to be superhuman? Leave earth alone and kill the people then live as GODS.<br />Ok, logic problems aside let's look at the \\"story\\" any origin story should follow the basis of the heroes journey, this is just how it works. Superman has an awful heroes journey because we don't know who he is. I have never been so bored by a superhero movie, I even liked Batman and Robin more than this because at least I could laugh at that.  This movie takes itself too seriously and falls in a place between boredom and not being able to be laughed at.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My kids and I love these little yellow guys! A new update has been created for Android based devices. When will Amazon make it available to us???
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Quick & simple setup, easy to use. Just wish that you there were more options than just Netflix & Hulu.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Supposed to clean out old and extra junk leftover on the kindle and free up memory. It says it's doing it, but without being able to really get into the nooks and crannies of the kindle op system, who knows. Anyways it's a OK app. I'd download it again if needed be.
B0081L391C|5.0|I didn't know if I would like this movie at first. I watched this movie twice in theaters and bought it later. I still love it and think it's one of the best comedies recently. Jonah Hill is hilarious in this movie, and Channing Tatum is actually pretty funny in this movie too. There are so many ridiculous scenes in this movie; I just about lost it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I loved it other then the fact it is in first person point of view. Can not wait to read more and see this movie.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was very comforting, and almost validating, to read this novel. When I picked up this book, I couldn't put it down and managed to finish it down in 5 hours. The prosaic, plain narrative style that Chbosky employs truly makes this story believable and relatable. The story of Charlie (the wallflower) truly made me reflect on my days in high school, leaning on the wall in the back of the cafeteria at the high school dance. For those who went to high school, I think they can all find some truth in this book. The movie is also faithful to the book, but I enjoyed this book because I was able to get inside Charlie's head. Truly a remarkable work.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Clever game!  Fun to play when I have a minute or two to kill.  Nice job on the Star Wars themes.
159102594X|2.0|Joe really can be a good storyteller; however, the use of crude language and gritty material was to much for me to enjoy this story. Also felt that the plot did not have a suitable climax to justify the time I spent on this book. Overall big disappointment for me.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun game, but if you don't finish the game, when you start to play again it's back to the very beginning, and lose rewards
B002E9OYRK|4.0|Bought this for my son and he loves the book.  He is studying Athletic Training and uses this book all the time.  Timeless information!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Frustrating at times but is lots of fun once you get the hang of it. Plan on getting not games like this
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Who doesn't like Candy Crush Saga.  But sure had a heck of a time trying to load it on my Kindle.  Only trouble is, it's taking away from my reading.
B00F2362IE|5.0|I got this for my Grandson on my Kindle while babysitting for 4 days. He loves it.  Guess he gets a Kindle for Christmas.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Don't normally read this type of novels, but got to admit that after reading the first, I had to read the next two.  Thought the ending would be better though.
B00DXP7L88|1.0|I loved this show up until about season 6.  The last season was a complete disaster, not to mention the horrible series finale.
1572814136|5.0|I do a lot of quick readings and I like the intensity of these colors-the colorings of some decks are too soft, some too vivid for rapid readings, these are perfect. I use the other decks for untimed readings.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It is a riveting story that really intrigued me.  As always a great story line and suspense all the way through.
B00001OH7T|2.0|bought this for a friend who loves Bowie. Sorry I couldn't be more helpful...It's a favorite of hers and she lost her copy so I thought I'd  replace it for her.
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|I could just go to the computer and get it for free. I haven't bought it YET but it is just stupid. it would make sense if it was $1 for mobility and for 1 new tower. Hopefully they will drop the price.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it better than the movie. Can't wait to start the next one.  The story is so fulfilling it leaves you wanting more.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|Love the game graphics are great gameplay is awesome. All in all its a great game. But it won't connect me to Facebook on my kindle
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love this app with all of its twist and turns. I've been stumped a couple of times but I've finally got to the end. Is there a part two?<br /><br />1hiplady
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great series.  Thought it was going to be all gore and the plot line about humanity and the way we react in turmoil really shows our true stripes.  The cast goes above and beyond to show us the best and worst of us if horrible situations.
B005LAIIPS|3.0|It isn't quite as compelling as the earlier trilogy, but The Bourne Legacy proves the franchise has stories left to tell -- and benefits from Jeremy Renner's magnetic work in the starring role. A fine movie, in the end. And that's the problem. It's just fine. The first three &#34;Bourne&#34; movies were incredible. It's twists and turns and nothing else. And fast and furious as it may be, if this is the best this once-smart series has to offer, this is no legacy. I would wait until this reaches the $5.00  rack. Spend your money on somthing else.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book grips you from the beginning.  Hard to put down as you want to know what is coming next.  Excellent read.
B008JFUPPI|5.0|A recently slain cop joins a team of undead police officers working for the Rest in Peace Department and tries to find the man who murdered him. I enjoyed Jeff Bridges and Ryan Reynolds on the screen together. There is plenty action and a fair amount of comedy. This is not a blockbuster or a classic movie, I would classify it as a good popcorn flick. Contrary to many other opinions here we both recommend this as a watchable movie, as long as your expectations are reasonable.
B00BC254I8|5.0|Well-written and well-researched. Lots of similar stories in the HBO special. I don't think I've ever read a more authentic and hard-hitting memoir.
B00EJX2YGM|5.0|I Love all the Twilight movies and  was so happy to finally receive my boxed set after waiting so long for it come out. There are deleted scenes in a couple of the movies and 7 discs of extras!  The box itself was such a wonderful surprise.  I was just expecting a bunch of individual boxes with the movies/extras included.  I don't want to give it away, but the packaging alone was worth waiting for to order this collection.
B003B02O0A|5.0|I decided to read this book again when Sycamore was released.  I'm not sure how this occurred but I truly enjoyed this book the second time around.  Not sure if this is because I was younger and just read to read or if life experiences made me look at a book differently; however, I definitely understand why it reached BESTSELLER status!!! Can't wait to start Sycamore Row.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|Fair, but not as good as the TV show. Does not meet the quality level of other writers of this type of story.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A story to remember, even if it's heart wrenching, to feel emotions and pain for a fictional character that in the end can never go back.
0446547646|5.0|Another great book by Nicholas Sparks. He always makes me laugh and cry. Glad I read this one...very well written.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|What can I say?  This film was an awesome screening experience.  It has it all as far as sic-fi action flix go - enormous monsters attacking the Earth, Enormous Robotic Warrior created and guided by human beings (perfectly blended with the consciousness of 2 &#34;drivers&#34;), and Good kicks the ass of evil. One word: Awesome.
B001EBV0NA|4.0|This is and continues to be the scariest movie I have ever seen because you not only get scared during the<br />viewing of the movie but it is what happens weeks, month's or even years later where you get flashbacks of certain scens or the<br />parts of movie especially the face of the demon. The face can pop up at any moment in you life and that is scary.<br />It is the scariest movie because what movie can still scare you years later by just remembering the face of the<br />devil on that child's face.

B000QRIGJY|5.0|Add another notch to your Bosch collection. This is another wonderfully developed character, so start at the beginning and follow Harry through the L.A. basin as he chases down murderers and keeps the reader riveted.
1401207529|4.0|Decent comic but not what I expected. Tells an interesting story between the bat and the detective. Decent but not the best, worth a read through.
B000001ESJ|5.0|Best trio in the world, followed closely by that little ol' band from Texas, ZZ Top. They just don't make music like this anymore.
1401216676|5.0|Absolutely a must have for a Batman fan. A darker comic that has some series kick in the overall story about Batman. Friend recommended this read and bought it instantly and will be a permanent in my collection.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Details the ticking time bomb that exists in L.A. As with the majority of big inner cities, there is an element just waiting for an excuse to riot and loot. Take a look at how one city had to handle it as Bosch must solve one of the hundreds of senseless murders that took place.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|My husband and both enjoyed the book.  He is not really a Stephen King fan ordinarily, but I convinced him to read this one since he was a young boy at the time and he really did like this story.  I learned a lot about the Kennedy assassination and was surprised by how much I never knew (I am 50).  The story is almost two stories in one.  And how he goes back and forth keeps the book from getting boring.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I'm still reading the book, but am enjoying it very much.  You know there has to be a catch and I'm looking forward to see if my assessment of the ending is correct.  Mr. Grisham is an engaging author.
B00B4804KS|5.0|What is there to say?  Its Jurassic Park in 3D.<br /><br />When I bought this it was on sale for 19.99 which was a steal.<br /><br />The 3D effects in this film are outstanding.  They took their time in the post production to make the effects professional without just running the whole film through a simple a program.  You can see a few areas where they had to brush in some effects because there was missing depth, but nothing that ruins the immersion or the film.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Such a fun game! So entertaining &amp; addicting! So many things to do I could never get bored! :) Get it &amp; experience the fun!!

B007PVHMCG|5.0|My 11 year old son loved this for his Birthday. He is into Minecraft and Pokemon big time right now. He put it together pretty fast but he still loved it. We can't find minecraft lego's in shops anywhere where we live, so thanks Amazon.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I love this game and it doesn't take that much space like other Gameloft games. I play it all the time and maybe more than Grand Theft Auto 5.
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|I can not get on until I update it. There is nowhere to update the app yet. Please fix. I love playing the game. But can't play until I update it. I have updated on my phone but the kindle needs it too.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have read most of his books and enjoy the way he brings the characters to life. It's hard to stop reading! He makes you feel like you are living the story.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I never wanted this to end. I literally ached when I wasn't reading it. It was so complex and yet so simple a story.  I'm honored to have read it.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|It's perfect. But it now. If you don't like cussing get the clean version but other than that but it!
B00BEIYL6G|5.0|I was a bit skeptical going into this movie that Ashton Kutcher could carry the role of Steve Jobs.  His performance surprised me and showed me that Kutcher has more acting chops than he normally uses in the sitcom settings we normally get to see him in.<br /><br />For the Apple purists out there this film may not be 100% accurate and since it only lasts about two hours there are obviously things that are left out.  With that said I really enjoyed the movie.  It hit the big points well, covering both the starting of Apple and Jobs eventual removal from the company.<br /><br />The movie shows Jobs for what he was, a visionary that often let his quest for the best product in the world erode his relationships with his family, friends and co-workers.  Kutcher seemed equally comfortable portraying Jobs highs and lows, from the yelling, screaming manic leader of a tech giant to the broken man that winds up crying back in the garage where Apple was created many years prior.<br /><br />I grew up during the Apple revolution and had an Apple IIe.  It was the first computer I remember seeing in a friend's house and we were all absolutely blown away by the possibilities.  There is no doubt that Steve Jobs changed the world with his vision.<br /><br />This movie may not change your world, but I think it does an entertaining job telling the story of one of the biggest personalities of our generation.  I highly recommend it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game, absolutely amazing! And though there are some problems it is just great, no other words but great. GET THIS GAME!!!!!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I like this better then the fb game as mine was glitched and couldn't move forward.  Looking forward to play cause I really liked the other one before the glitch on my account
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|One of Grisham's better efforts.  I was about to give up on reading any more of his books - but I am glad I did read Sycamore Row.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have been reading Mr. King's novels for over 29 years.  Some of his reads are good and others are terrific.  Doctor Sleep is &#34;TERRIFIC&#34;!  This is a book that you can't put down, and you will find yourself reading it into the wee hours of the morning.
1400034205|5.0|How did I miss this for so long???  It's flat-out brilliant.  I read 40 or 50 novels per year, and there are two I ignored until the past year: this, and David Copperfield.  They are both sooooo damn good, it's painful to compare them to anything on the Oprah/NYT lists.
B005TBN3EU|3.0|It was fine but I liked the first and third better.  This one seemed a little repetitive to me.  Some funny parts though, of course.
B00GOQ9M4O|1.0|This was absolutely the worst episode of TWD ever.  Could they fit just one more cliché into the storyline?  I don't think so ... what a waste of time.  Kill the Governor off already - the character stinks and the writing on this episode stinks.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|Discs played OK with no hang-ups.  Keep the discs in the case and be careful with the discs and they will last.
B00EE3HVMO|5.0|This series is so much more than a murder mystery. So much more than The Killing, to which it has been compared. Yes, there is a murder, and the solving of it is the central thread. But Broadchurch is a full dramatic tapestry, with fine subplots and side stories about the inhabitants of the town and how their lives are affected by this murder. Along the way, there are numerous red herrings and inviting alleys that turn out to be blind in the end. The writing and acting are superb. And the setting, thankfully, is a sunny seaside town, rather than a dreary, continuously rainy Seattle. I hope the Blu-ray, which contains additional commentary, is released in Region 1 format. The DVD is not yet in Region 1 format either.<br /><br />I know a U.S. remake of this is planned, with Chris Chibnall as producer. I hope he can catch lightning in a bottle twice. And I hope David Tennant turns in as marvelous a performance when he uses a planned American accent as when he speaks in his native Scottish or delightful Estuary accents.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I do like this game.  But what I don't like is that you have to pay to get more lives...or wait 10-20 minutes to get more.  That's a pretty big turnoff to me and caused me to give the rating that I did.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|This is such a classic story,  Audrey Hepburn is absolutely wonderderful.  This is a movie that can be enjoyed by anyone.
B00BL9860K|3.0|For me this is a book in two parts.  I found the first third of the book mostly ho hum.  There were some exciting parts, for instance how they found their teenage client, but there were lots of references to past books cases that left me, if not lost, bored. The only other Baldacci book I've read is \\"The Innocent\\" which I found edge of my chair exciting right from the start, a completely different experience than with \\"King and Maxwell\\".  After the beginning third the action began to pick up and by about half way through I was hooked.  It still wasn't as good as \\"The Innocent\\" but it is well worth reading if you can get through the opening.  Mostly what bored me was the push pull relationship between the two main characters.  Their not quite love affair felt too prolonged and plain silly.  Again maybe if I'd read some of the previous books in this series that plot element would have been more compelling.<br /><br />The back and forth action between the Middle East and the US added excitement as did the government and military aspects of the plot.  The father/son relationship was well done and believable.  Conspiracy theorists will be in their element with this book.  It was a stretch for me.  As I've said it's probably best if you've read the prior books in this series before tackling this one.<br /><br />This review is based on an ebook provided by the publisher.<br />(Above disclaimer provided as required by the FTC.)
B00FOU1O3S|3.0|I played another version of this that was more entertaining. This is good if you want to rest your brain from thinking games.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Obviously I have seen all these before but I felt it was time to update to blu-ray as once you start watching sic-fi movies on blu-ray you really can't go back to dvd to watch them. Great price at the time, all the movies are here and I couldn't be happier.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Disappointing novel from this great author. Too many characters not fully developed and none that were engaging enough to sustain my interest in a slow moving plot.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Four issues with this product: (1)it does not have a simple remote control to control this product like TV we used to.  I cannot use smartphone to control it while someone call me on the iphone.  And my senior mother does not use to by using smart phone to do the remote control function.  She likes to have a regular simply remote control like TV remote.  (2) it only support Youtube and netflex, very very limited selection. After two months usage, I just left it there without any usage (3) it does not support Chromecast over the Chrome OS in the smartphone like iPhone.  (4) the product sometimes is not stable (sometime works sometime does not work and I have to do power-on-off thing to bring it back).
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This complex novel is engaging on emotional, intellectual levels, telling a great story that reflects the values and limitations of the times in the era of slavery in the south. It addresses, through the perspective of two characters, the limitations and challenges of women during this time. The characters are so fully developed that as a reader I felt their individual rage and in turn hopefulness. The plot kept me reading when I really should have put the book down and done something else. Outstanding!
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|Great movie, I love it. Nice and clear on blu-ray! Glad I waited for the extended edition, that's for sure.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|This book was interesting and the tension developed through the plot and character development kept me interested for most of the book. The plot seemed to get contrived about half way through. The ending was disappointing...using too much drama to invoke a reaction from the reader so that it actually seemed trite.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I loved Shiver. It was beautifully written. I am a big fan of Maggie Stiefvater’s writing and I’ve enjoyed everything I’ve read of hers. However, I avoided Shiver because of the mixed reviews I heard about it. Finally, I decided to read it and I’m really glad I did because it was so much better than I expected.<br /><br />Shiver was written so beautifully. It was a slower paced, descriptive novel, which I enjoyed. I felt like I really connected with Grace, the main character. She was independent, curious, organized, and also a little alone. Her family was very self obsessed, focusing more on their careers and social life, leaving Grace to fend for herself often. Grace’s curiosity about the wolves, especially one she vaguely remembered from her attack as a child, seemed a bit weird at first, but not in an unbelievable way. I was drawn to the story in Shiver. I couldn’t help it because of the way the author writes and the way she creates a sort of magic between the characters, the setting, and emotions.<br /><br /> The thing about Shiver is that I’m so in love with the writing and the connection between Grace and Sam. It is beyond what I expected. Which is weird because the plot didn’t ever really grip me and that’s probably why I put off reading it for so long. When I hear people talk about Shiver, especially those who didn’t like it, it sounds horrible. A girl who fell in love with a wolf before she knew he was actually a person? That’s so weird. Absentee YA parents? Aggravating! Another introverted quiet girl? Boring! But for all of the things that make Shiver a run of the mill YA paranormal story, there are twice as many things that make it different, unique, and not at all annoying.<br /><br /> Honestly, I think the only bad thing Shiver had going for it was the timing. It was released post-Twilight at a time when people were either craving more of the same or scoffing at the idea that a YA romance should even be a thing. The scathing reviews I see for Shiver are typically written during that awkward post-Twilight time period that I think was really hard for many YA authors. People either hated it because it was too much like Twilight or not enough like Twilight and I think that’s a real shame.<br /><br /> I liked Shiver because it was elegant and gripping. I cared about the characters in ways that I think sometimes only Maggie Stiefvater can make me care. I rooted for them. I understood Grace and her parents and the way her circumstances shaped her. I understood her curiosity for the wolves and I even understood how she felt protective over the wolf before she ever knew he was more than a wolf.<br /> I think it’s been long enough after Twilight that YA authors and novels don’t have to be compared to it. I think YA has come into itself and if ever there was a time to pick up Shiver, it’s now when you can fully appreciate it without silly expectations and comparisons. If you are a fan of Maggie Stiefvater’s writing, I don’t see how Shiver will be a disappointment, even if wolves aren’t your thing.<br /><br />A Note About The Negative Reviews: Some of the reviews that aren’t positive mentioned that the author’s prose was too much, the characters were too mature, Sam was too poetic for a teenager to be, and Grace was a terrible friend because of how she let Sam take precedence over her previous friends. I only mention these because I couldn’t disagree more. When I was a teenager, I loved the sort of style that Stiefvater used in this novel. All of the books I read over and over again were similar in tone. I connected to characters like Grace. I was poetic like Sam (and so were guys I went to school with, so the idea that guys can’t be poetic just infuriates me. While I’ve never been romantically drawn to these types of guys, to assume they don’t exist and having characters like that is unrealistic is ridiculous). I hate the idea that YA novels are judged half the time for havingcharacters who are too mature and then half the time for having characters who are too immature. I think people ought to remember that, while teens tend to have similar characteristics, they are quite different from one another, too. Not only would Shiver have been probably one of my favorite books as a teen, but I think in many ways Sam and Grace were like me. And I felt like Grace’s friends took her for granted some of the time and didn’t always let her be fully herself and Sam did. And we should all remember how often we let new people who we connected with more have the front seat in our lives as teenagers, leaving some of our old friends in the back, forgotten. None of this things seem unrealistic to me at all.<br /><br /> Sometimes I feel like people read YA even though they are too closed minded and they stick too much to their own preconceived notions of what teenagers feel/want/need/like/should be to really enjoy it.<br /><br /> I highly recommend Shiver. It’s a great book and I can’t wait to read the rest of the series.characters who are too mature and then half the time for having characters who are too immature.

B00GH4R95C|1.0|This was a really awful movie. It was way too long ( 2 hours 22 minutes) with really slow plot development. How a director can totally waste both Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner is beyond me, but this man sure did.<br />  My wife gave up before we were an hour into it, and that was the smart thing to do. This is a really bad movie and I highly recommend you don't waste your money as we did.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|GREAT GREAT GREAT I LOVE IT.<br />I do not want this series to get an end.<br />The best series ever
0307719774|5.0|my dad got this for me for Christmas.<br />I've been writing in it since January 1 of 2013 and it's been so interesting.<br />It takes literally 30 seconds every day, and it asks me questions whose answers will probably change in a few months, so I can preserve a little bit of who I am every year and see how much I change.<br />The book itself is nice- I wish it was a little bigger or maybe spiral-bound, but no real complaints otherwise.<br />get this book. you/your future self won't regret it.

B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Great Movie!  But them I am such a Trekkie it has to be! It's a different perspective from the original series so it keeps your attention. Not to mention the better effects.
B00DIMXTBO|5.0|In, Outin, Book 2 of the &#34;Inner Movement&#34; series, the mood has darkened and Nate is no longer as young in mind-set as he was in the beginning. There are sci-fi books then there are SCI-FI books. Brandt Legg writes the latter. From epic ideas to amazing world building, you'll go on a ride as far as your imagination can stretch.<br />It might just change how you think about the dimensions.

B0093X80VQ|5.0|I love that they made a book after Charlie and the chocolate factory. It is a really good book to read I love it!!
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I read this with my 12yr daughter. We have similar taste in books, but this is one where we disagree. She loved it and is continuing with the series. I had little patience for it, and I'm not continuing my reading.<br /><br />What I Liked<br />---------------<br />* Smart and creative urban fantasy world with a unique take on traditional supernatural races.<br /><br />* Open conversations about sex and attraction, in line with real experiences teens have.<br /><br />* Sexual orientation diversity normalized<br /><br />What I Didn't Like<br />--------------------<br />* Oh The Drama - this books is short on action and long on dramatic teen angst and relationship drama. I'm not surprised my daughter likes this, as it's similar to some things she's experiencing in real life. I'm just glad she has other books that offer different ways to handle excessive drama. I found myself rolling my eyes a lot.<br /><br />* Main female character needs a lot of rescuing - would prefer her to be more independent and less hand-wringing. Again, am glad my daughter has books with other perspectives of female lead characters.<br /><br />* Weird relationship choices - one 20+yo man picking up on 18yo boy, and boys friends encouraging him to go out with the older man. I guess one of the benefits of this was an opportunity to discuss the shades of gray in statutory rape laws, but I still thought it was an odd choice for the author to make. Can't mention the other weird relationship choice without giving spoilers, but it's definitely more odd/questionable than the previous one I mentioned.<br /><br />I found the quality of writing in the book to be decent. For me, the content ranged from meh to annoying to wtf. As I said, it was strange and uncompelling enough for me to abandon the series. If you're curious, I recommend checking it out of the library before spending any money on it.

I watch a few tv series but I find that they get stale so we shall see how &#34;Fringe turns out after I get by the first season. I am through the first 10 episodes and the plots are fresh, the character development superb, and the special effects seem to keep up with the stories.  The humor is random and appropriate and I look forward to finishing the season.

All these \\"Social\\" Issues are dealt with in true Gene Roddenberry Spirit.<br /><br />It is too sad that, with the dawn of the wars we began waging, the producers of the Show were pressured they should find their own \\"Terrorists\\" in Space, and follow a storyline which culminated in the Zindi blowing up a planet, (4th Season), and destroying great chunks of Earth, rendering it uninhabitable.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the first two Seasons of \\"Star Trek: Enterprise\\" are indeed a Joy to Watch, and  hopefully, my DVD and Player will last for a long time to come.<br /><br />This is a Keeper, for sure.

0743497465|4.0|Dan Brown is one of the more well known of authors in United States. His series chronicling the adventures of Robert Langdon have gone on to be one if the most successful series in the world. A lesser known book, Deception Point, is actually one of my favorites of all of his works. It's full of twists and turns. But the biggest problem is the plot, which is simply a copy of his other novels but set around different circumstances.<br /><br />Deception Point revolves around the story of a major NASA discovery amidst a string of failures and controversy. The findings will have a major impact for humankind and it has come during a pivotal moment in the race for the presidency of te United States. What follows is a roller-coaster ride from the Artic Circle to the heart of Washington D.C. as the story slowly unravels its secrets in a very-well planned manner. The whole premise of the novel is based the notion of surprise, so I don't want to give away too much, but there were some very interesting plot twists throughout the book that kept me on my toes as I made my way through the story.<br /><br />If this is one of the first books by Dan Brown that you read, it is probably going make for a much better read than if you have read many of his others. The thing is, Deception Point is structured very much like all the rest of Brown's novs. Even the characters are just recasts of the same mould he uses for every single book.In this case, Rachel Sexton, the daughter of the candidate running for the Presidency against the current President and also the White House Liason for the NRO (National Reconnaissance Office). She is the typical protagonist of Brown's novels: intelligent and very resourceful, Rachel finds herself thrown into and whole different world as everything she knew is challenged and now she is tasked with preventing a major disaster (Sounds like something familiar?). And, of course, you have the other secondary characters present: the strong and respected figure that the protagonist has looked up to and also a romantic interest that develops over the course of the story.<br /><br />I've read all of Dan Brown's books at least once or twice and this formula is definitely getting a little bit old. Deception Point is one of the first novels he ever published, but it's still a bit worrying to see that not much has changed from book to book. Compared to his previous novel, Digital Fortress, this book is simply the SAME exact plot with different characters and subject matter.<br /><br />I do really like the subject he took on and felt that he does a very good job at bringing out the finer details and points of the story. I'm a huge NASA fan and this book deals with something that I'm fascinated with. Brown does a good job of bringing the story to life and really integrating strong factual basis into crafting a compelling story.<br /><br />Deception Point on its own is a very great novel. It has all the makings of a great thriller: numerous plot twists, strong subject matter, and a well-paced plot. However, it falls short due to the fact that it really is just the same old story told again. For fans of Dan Brown books: don't expect any deviation from the tried and true formula he has worked on over the part few years. Still, it's entertaining to read.t the protagonist has looked up to and also a romantic interest that develops over the course of the story.<br /><br />I've read all of Dan Brown's books at least once or twice and this formula is definitely getting a little bit old. Deception Point is one of the first novels he ever published, but it's still a bit worrying to see that not much has changed from book to book. Compared to his previous novel, Digital Fortress, this book is simply the SAME exact plot with different characters and subject matter.<br /><br />I do really like the subject he took on and felt that he does a very good job at bringing out the finer details and points of the story. I'm a huge NASA fan and this book deals with something that I'm fascinated with. Brown does a good job of bringing the story to life and really integrating strong factual basis into crafting a compelling story.<br /><br />Deception Point on its own is a very great novel. It has all the makings of a great thriller: numerous plot twists, strong subject matter, and a well-paced plot. However, it falls short due to the fact that it really is just the same old story told again. For fans of Dan Brown books: don't expect any deviation from the tried and true formula he has worked on over the part few years. Still, it's entertaining to read.

0060873175|3.0|Micro is book much like the many that have come from Michael Crichton. Sadly, he died before he finished the novel, and Richard Preston picked up from where he left off. While Micro is still part of Michael Crichton's work of novels, it doesn't feel the same as the rest. Richard Preston did a great job on trying to recreate the same feel, but it doesn't live up to the other books. I could see the ideas and promise of the book, but the actual book only grazed the surface of what could have been.<br /><br />The premise of the book is simple. A high tech corporation develops groundbreaking technology: they can shrink living creatures and objects down to the micro world (hence the title). Something goes wrong and now a group of graduate students are thrown into an unfamiliar and dangerous world, fighting for their very survival. If this sounds very familiar, it should. The basic plot of the book very similar to that of Timeline, another of Crichton's stories. The whole idea of going into the micro world has endless potential for a thrilling book.<br /><br />The book starts off fairly slow. There is a lot of build up to the main plot of the book. Almost all of the characters are thrown at you at the very beginning of the book, creating a very confusing first quarter or so of reading. While the very act of introducing these characters early on is not that bad, the personalities of them are what make it so hard. Some characters are very well developed throughout the story, while some just are dragged along for the ride. Vin Drake, the chilling investor in the company is one of the better characters. Preston found a way to really bring out his cold and calculating mind and I felt a real loathing for him. Many times I found myself angry at what he did. But, Preston left some of the characters really underdeveloped, such as Danny Minot, one of the graduate students thrown into the dark, dangerous world. He was a bit plain and although Preston tried to bring across his personality, it seemed a bit forced and unnatural.<br /><br />Preston did, however, bring in a lot more scientific fact into the story. Micro is littered with small passages explaining some nuance of insects or poisons. While not exactly boring, I found these little tidbits a bit distracting from the hectic pace of the story. I am intrigued by science behind the characters actions, but it didn't feel like they added a whole lot to the story. They were added in more for the sake of having something to talk about than to explain bigger ideas.<br /><br />All in all, Micro doesn't exactly feel like a Michael Crichton book. I can see his influences in the writing and in the whole idea, but Preston didn't execute the whole idea perfectly. During some parts of the book, I was well into reading, but I just couldn't connect with some of the characters. While not the very best book, Micro is still a good read. It has suspense and action, but feels a bit short on character development.lity, it seemed a bit forced and unnatural.<br /><br />Preston did, however, bring in a lot more scientific fact into the story.

0156027321|5.0|Life of Pi is one of those rare books that makes a strong impression on both the book world and movie world. I have watched both the movie in theaters and read the book. I found that the actually written hard copy of the story provided much more insight and power than that of the silver screen. What Yann Martel has done is something of the olden times of storytellers. The words had a certain spark and feel to it and turned words into whole new adventure.<br /><br />Martel documents the story of a young boy named Piscine Patel, or as he will soon to be called, Pi. He's young Indian boy living with his family in a small town. They own a zoo, though they aren't the richest family in town. After the political turmoil in India in the 1970s, the family decides to leave the country for Canada and sell the zoo. On the voyage across the Pacific, their ship sinks in the midst of a storm and Pi finds himself the lone survivor of the wreck along with a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena, and a Bengal tiger. The rest of the book is dedicated to their story of survival and hardship in the face of adversity and a seemingly impossible task.<br /><br />It's story based on true events and is taken directly from Mr. Patel (Pi) himself many years after the events in the book. The story is not just a rehash of some newspaper story or something that was created. It was deeply personal and insightful in a way that you cannot create without interviewing someone. The passages ringed with the true feelings and emotions Mr. Patel must have experienced out on the Pacific and Martel did an amazing job translating that into the words, sentences, and scenes throughout the book.<br /><br />I did not expect how Life of Pi started out. It told the early story of Pi and his experiments dabbling into different types of religions. He was born a Hindu, but began to explore Christianity and Islam, creating a balance between the three and somehow bridging a gap between the different religions. This idea of harmony between what many would see as completely different ideologies would play out later through the book in the form of harmony between man and beast. It was a bit tough and slow to get through, but also provided and interesting and insightful look into the people and the mentality of the time.<br /><br />This is a book that brings a sense of humility and helplessness in the grand scheme of life, yet at the same time giving hope for every individual. Here we have a young boy, thrown into a terrible situation without any wrongdoing on his part. Nothing he could have done could have prevented such a disaster. He is faced with insurmountable odds for survival, yet he has the will to live and takes it upon himself to preserve until he reaches land and safety.<br /><br />Life of Pi is one of those books that blends fiction and reality in a way that is almost impossible to separate. The ending is less of a decisive resolution to the story than an open question. Books and words are not the definitive truth of the world and sometimes the best stories are not the truth.<br /><br />I really loved Life of Pi. It was different, it was compelling, and it spoke volumes about the value of all life on the planet. It is a book to turn to in dark times as an inspiration to continue, as an candle in the night, lighting you way through the darkness. Some parts were a bit slow, but it doesn't detract from the overall story.Martel has created one of the books of the generation and will be remembered for years to come.ony between what many would see as completely different ideologies would play out later through the book in the form of harmony between man and beast.

B00AFROVQC|2.0|Is this book a young adult novel? because it reads like one - but not even a good one. There is so much more the author could have done with this series - the characters need a lot more development as well as the plot. Also, each book is very short. Sadly I may continue reading just to find out what happens in the end but I will get them from the library and not spend anymore money on them.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book made me laugh and cry at the same time. Somehow John Green makes tragedy endearing and heart warming in this novel. I could not put the book down and want to reread it very soon. In addition, I've recommended it to all my family and friends. It really brings the struggle of cancer (or any terminal illness) to light in a way that makes you love those who suffer without pitying them.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I have been making my way through all three seasons on Amazon Prime and have to say that the remastered special effects are absolutely fabulous.  I realize that some people may be perturbed by this, since they feel the original effects were good enough, but the new effects, combined with what appears to be cleaned up other scenes, make this set a gem.<br /><br />I have literally seen the original episodes hundreds of times, but it has been quite some time since I viewed them.  As another reviewer said, they have great messages, but more importantly, they are much better television than I ever realized.  There is drama, incredible humor, beautiful music, and other features which make me want to watch these episodes again and again.  And this is what I intend to do.<br /><br />As a long time trekker, I believe that all of the series were excellent in their own way, but TOS stands out for me as the best.  Since it was so long ago, there wasn't any need to rely on fancy special effects (which is ironic because that is how this remastered set defines itself), so the stories were just magnificent.  Some notable ones:<br /><br />1. 'City on the Edge of Forever' - who can forget the scene when Kirk finds out McCoy has reached the time period he is in and how he runs to greet him, which leads to the death of Edith Keeler.  Simply masterful TV.<br /><br />2. 'Mirror, Mirror' - a neat and fun episode which opened up the entire world of the alternate universe.  The subtle sexual overtones between several of the characters, including Marlene Moreau, are great.<br /><br />3. 'The Ultimate Computer' - a timely review of the importance (and dangers) of computers.  Little did the writer of this episode know how things would turn out 40 years later!<br /><br />4. 'The Doomsday Machine' - One of my favorites, if not the least for the superb performance of William Windom as Commodore Decker.  Tremendous drama and suspense in an episode which didn't even feature any alien lifeforms.<br /><br />I could go on and on for hours about how great these episodes are.  Just know that while they were always great, the remastered set has elevated these to a new level.  And for that reason, we get to enjoy them over and over again./><br />I could go on and on for hours about how great these episodes are.

B0039Q7QKE|4.0|A big upgrade over the plastic pin that came with my costume.  Not too heavy (I worried it would make the shirt sag).  It uses two pin posts, which I think is smart since it distributes the weight of the pin.

B002HLM4E0|5.0|Great for kids, not boring for adults!  Saw it with my 7 year old son, and the whole family enjoyed it.  We read the books a while ago, and film ads a great dimension to the experience of Harry Potter.  We'll definitely be watching it again.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is by far one of the best games out there.  So glad it became available for kindle. After working hard all day it's so nice to sit back and be able to play a game for hours. Other games may have a time limit that you can play that increases 1 per 20 minutes or so. But not this one. Totally awesome to be able to play as long as you like
0807014273|5.0|By far, the best book on mindfulness ever written.  Simple as that.  Non-medical folks may find the second half a little technical, but the story of the journey is amazing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a good balance of challenge, neither too easy nor too difficult.  It was a lot of fun, but only ten levels.

B000NY12LO|5.0|I really liked this book. It was an interesting read to see both sides of bullying and what set's a shooter off. It keeps you guessing and you won't be able to put it down. Definitely a good book club discussion pick.

B005HSG3TC|4.0|a little ho um in color but useful in covering the kindle for protections<br />would order it again if I needed to
B00FQ272ZI|5.0|I like that there is a lot of praise for this film, which I saw a few hours ago. It's still unfolding for me as I think about it, like another lost-at-sea film Open Water did a few years ago. In that one, the protagonists were hapless victims of absurdity they couldn't anticipate. In this one, it feels as though Our Man has long been preparing for a kind of existential showdown, his own requirement for redemption perhaps. The plausibility of the nautical aspects some have complained about isn't of particular interest to me. It is the conspiring sky and sea, and immutable Earthly forces grown to behemoth proportions that are central to the allegorical narrative. Our man is tossed and forgotten in their pitiless swirl, his grip on what identifies him is soon broken. In moments he is aglow as if lit from a watchful heaven, meanwhile sharks circle below. In its foreboding and uncertainty, there is poetry and beauty in the film. Highly recommended.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Always wanted to see this in Blu ray. Finally now I will and the graphic are gonna blow me away again
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Great way to end the Divergent story. Not what I expected but nonetheless a very griping and non stop action story.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great book, love the way the story started with three separate lives but they were all connected somehow. Beautifully written and the story was so believable too. The author is truly talented and this book is a testament to that. A must read!
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|The trick is to get rid of all the buttons.  The hard part is figuring out exactly HOW to do that.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|fun game to play to pass the time with. Just be sure to not spend cash on it, be patient and its lots of fun for free.
0399230033|5.0|This is one of the most colorful book I ever bought for my young daughter. She was laughing when we get to the page in darkness and many pairs of eyes. Definitely a book to have at home!
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Slooow. The plot is compelling. But the story is unbelievably slow in the telling. I like the narrator quite well. He did a great, but not overdone job with the southern accents and ethnicities. Because of all the description and many many points of view, I couldn't stop my mind from drifting and had to hit rewind numerous times throughout the story. I would suddenly realize I had lost attention and had no idea who was speaking or what was happening. That said, it was a complex, interesting story. I am a Grisham fan and a Jake Brigance fan and my expectations were very high. I would have given an author unknown to me four stars rather than three. On the other hand, if I hadn't known it would eventually be worth it because it's Grisham, I would never have gotten past the first few chapters.
0689815816|5.0|I bought this after reading an online article &#34;100 must read books before your child turn 14&#34;. This book is engaging and dramatic. I can't forget my child actually covered her mouth in excitement when we are in the most dramatic turn of event as the story unfolds. Definitely a classic book to be kept in our home library!
0345529057|4.0|The books are stunning and thorough, with deeper descriptions of the characters than on the popular HBO show. I love his writing style and how descriptive he is. I immediately felt like I was in Westeros. My only gripe is that they are long, and my attention span is not what it used to be.
141694737X|4.0|My 3 year old has read countless lift-the-flap books before getting this. Hence, it did not generate much excitement as it should be. I looked closer. This book is a 30 year old classic book. It must be the trend setter for all flap books. I will read to my other young child when he turns 2 year old in the future. It will be more suitable to a younger reader.
0517543052|5.0|A book that I sincerely enjoy, and one I've read several times. The pictures and quirky writing are memorable, especially the gorgeous depictions of Kali. The practical advice about enlightenment, peace, emotional stability, and such are very valuable to the person who feels frazzled and is in need of a little guidance.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The story does not get bogged down by too many details like some of Mr. Grisham\\"s other books. It was definitely a page turner.<br />I hope that when the book becomes a movie, that Matthew M. Will play the part of Jake.<br />Loved the story and the characters!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites.  It has humor, the various actors play off each other well, and being a senior, I can relate to the different situations that they were experiencing.  The Indian setting was very beautiful with the colors and music.  A great story line.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|I really liked this book.  It was fun to revisit the characters and see how life has molded them.  I disagree with those that felt all characters should have remained and wanted to see a continuation of their lives.  That would have been boring and dull.  Her antics and crazy thoughts are amusing.  She is real and I related.  Thank you, Ms. Fielding!!!
B00FEHXISA|5.0|How can you not love Downie Jr. in all of these movies. Grew up with the comics and by far my favorite super hero!!

0062107313|5.0|This is the best Amy Tan book since Joy Luck Club which I loved.  The characters are well developed and the story moves along swiftly.  Yes, a couple of the chapters were a bit too long in my opinion but that did not stop me from stealing time to get back to the book.  It was a page turner and I disagree with another reviewer that it was predictable. I will explain...some of the turning points were easy to see coming but the details and situations that added to the complexity of the novel were not predictable.  Readers are expected to uncover clues writers deposit in novels and this act of being involved and thinking are what reading is all about!  The themes are not simply mother/daughter.  Covered are the themes of loss, prejudice, rebellion, and countless others.  It has left me thinking about what we do to survive and how much love and acceptance are a part of human nature.  Many reviewers are comparing the book to Arthur Golden's Memoirs of a Geisha, high praise for Ms. Tan in my opinion. If you enjoyed that book and the writing of Lisa See this is a \\"read alike.\\"  There are not a lot of books of this genre and I believe this is why the comparison is out there but I saw it very much as a wonderful, rich story with characters I grew to like and wanted to know more about.  Worth the 580 page read.

B001DF68MA|3.0|this child bike seat is a great concept, however, this specific seat is small. i highly doubt that my daughter will be able to use this past 2 years old, due to the size of the seat and the length in which her legs can be put down. other than that, it was simple to set up and my daughter enjoyed being able to sit close with me while i biked. she seemed comfortable in it, since she was able to fall asleep with her head resting on the front padding. however, it was difficult to bike with her in that sleeping position, because she would often sway to one side, which would throw my balance off and could possibly cause her to fall off the bike. this item has a short shelf life for kids.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Awesome Movie to watch alone or in agroup... just a really good movie to watch at any time or place
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Easy game to play. User friendly young kids can play. I would recommend it to friends and play other games that are made by this company.
1568363931|5.0|Offers a lot of variety in meals. Simple to read and I love the &#34;timelines&#34; included that show you exactly when to perform a specific task in the context of the entire cooking process.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|Thor was surprisingly smart, funny and yet respectful of the character and the Avenger series.  I have heard that the Avenger series is written to appeal to women as well as men.  Thor definitely manages to do this and without becoming a &#34;chick flick.&#34;<br />There is plenty of action but the characters are also well developed.  Demi-gods have family issues too.  Of course their family squabbles can level a small town in New Mexico.
B00EJGMCG6|5.0|This is one great album that spans their career.  The DVD is an added bonus although some of the editing effects are sophomoric.  The last two albums (Formation of Damnation and Dark Roots of Earth) are the best thrash albums released in the last five years all do to the amazing guitar teamwork of Alex Skolnick and Eric Peterson.  I have been a fan since 1988 and could not be happier with Alex back in the band.  This album starts hard and ends hard and the only thing I would change or add would be to include the song 'Electric Crown' to the mix.  Five stars.

B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|I liked this movie even though several people told me that Tom Cruise was too short for the role. I can see their point that if a character's described a certain way, then it should cast accordingly but sometimes that doesn't always work out. Even though Tom Cruise is a little crazy, he still manages to make/star in great films.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I'm always a little skeptical of another book by an author I thoroughly enjoyed. It's like I am afraid they will ruin what they gave me the first time by not delivering in subsequent books. And then I'll think less of what I truly enjoyed the first time... In this case, i actually let the author's book between The Kite Runner and this book pass. For some reason I felt this might be safer for me and Mr. Hosseini. And it was. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The story line was poignant and true to itself. The characters were real, intense, lovable and hate-worthy. I felt immersed in the generations and appreciated the parallel story lines which provided insight into the characters from other characters' perspectives. I highly recommend it.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Morgan Freeman's character was a little clichéd but I loved this movie because it got a major &#34;what the F&#34; moment from me and that rarely happens.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Inspiring story about overcoming life's obstacles.  Loved the perspective of a variety of the characters.  It helped develop the story that much better.  Some parts were heart wrenching to read as a parent, but added to the strength of the story.  I recommend for ages 8 thru adult.  This novel makes for a great classroom read aloud with enriching discussion.

When the world becomes too much, your pet kitten dies, a suicide occurs down the lane, your father appears drawn to your young governess, you retreat into another world, a wondrous, strange, and dangerous world that demolishes the bounds of reality.  It's a world that marvels and threatens you but also provides you with the comforting home you long for, as well as with the understanding and all-powerful protectors you desire.  When things right themselves, your other world slips from you, recedes into uncertain memory as you get on with your life.  Though, if you are creative enough, or put upon enough, it returns to you again to offer a bit of solace.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman's fantasy of a man returning to his past and the imaginative escape world he'd conjured as a boy to save himself from his painful reality not only makes for a delightful tale but also stimulates memories of your own fantasies, of the worlds you may have created by yourself for yourself or in conjunction with your friends.  It's a pleasure to cast back and remember, even if you weren't trying to cope with a troubled reality.  Part of the magic of [[ASIN:0062255657 The Ocean at the End of the Lane: A Novel]] is its transportive quality.<br /><br />Plainly written, well imagined, perfectly paced, it reminds you of how scary the adult world can seem to a child.  Not to say the world isn't also scary for adults, too, who often have their own methods of escape that are not nearly as innocent as a child's.<br /><br />So, escape on an otherworldly adventure with Gaiman.  It'll do wonders for you.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Best book I've ever read. Filled with emotion. Couldn't ever put it Down. Can't wait to see if they have a movie for it too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. It is so fun. I love horses. It mostly seems like you are taking care of it. They have a lot of things to do n feed to them
630471193X|5.0|This is a beautiful thought provoking movie. What if you potential became this high and you still retained your humanity?<br />It's very touching. A favorite.<br /><br />The sound track is a favorite too. Lovely hopeful songs from some of our favorite singers. Eric Clapton for one.
B00EI4V3X2|2.0|I purchased these for the out of the box PS4 compatibility claim. While that statement is true, there is a fatal flaw with this headset, it turns off every 5 min! Regardless of using with the PS4 or PC, the headset beeps and then shuts off every time. I've tried re-paring, changing all settings and nothings resolves the problem. I'm guessing I received a faulty pair but I will not be replacing these with another. When the sound does work it's decent but not great. The build quality is pretty poor for the price. Bad first impression for Turtle Beach.
159420411X|5.0|Nate Silver, who clashed with TV Republican political pundits on TV prior to the 2012 presidential elections, predicted correctly all 50 states in 2012, demonstrating that their opinions were political bluster rather than intelligent dialogue. In 2008, Silver correctly predicted 49 of 50 states, giving him a 0.990 batting average, whereas political pundits such as Peggy Noonan and Joe Scarborough were sent back to the minor leagues. In this book, Silver discusses how probability and statistics can be used to study such phenomena as earthquakes, climate change, poker, chess, terrorism, and financial bubbles, among other phenomena. This would be a good book for economists, business majors (including sports management), mathematicians, engineers and scientists (including political science). In fact, maybe this should be required reading for such majors.  I was hoping Nate would describe some of his political predicting methods, but maybe he is saving that for his next book.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read.  The now friends I made while reading will be with me forever.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|Love game but can't play without updates. So keep trying and can't find any updates that is wrong to not have when it will not play without it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Lots of fun and frustration at the same time. Very addictive!! Love playing. Just wish you'd get more lives in less amount of time.
B0015AARJI|1.0|It was bootleg.  The seller bribed we with an Amazon gift card to not give a bad review.  However after the controller failed to hold charge right out of the package (which claimed the color was red, it is black), and currently will not even turn on.  I have decided to let everyone know, this was a piece of garbage.  Beware
0380002930|4.0|When I started reading this book, I did not know what to expect.  I had never read a book that puts you into the mind of a rabbit.  It was very well written and definitely worth my time.  I will probably read it again.

B004GYY714|4.0|this is a great radio app.  i use it every morning with my headphones so i don't bother those around me who aren't as into my radio listening habit.  occasionally there is a little bit of a buffering issue, but nothing too bothersome.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Its a very fun game but involves a lot of time. It does freeze occasionally, but is still fun. Oh yea it does glitch too.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I just love this book, even more than book 1 in the series.... so FULL in experiences.  This book does not disappoint.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A definite must read! I could not put it down for one second. So interesting!! Read it read it now
B004ZN9ERI|4.0|this is the start of a great band. It's early psych rock and it's pretty good. However it's not the type of prog rock that they later became , that really started in 1970.  This is was a mix of garage psych and acid rock. (which harder styles of acid rock later became a  type of early metal ,one song on here is of that style ).  So fans of later pink Floyd may not get it. But if you like psych rock then this is a good example of it.  It's not a accessible type of music and it's days were very short because lsd burns out people's minds. like syd barret. (rip) whose is a prime example of this. Still for a debut of a major band this shows that they were a talented bunch. But I reject those who don't know the history of the music or it's time. Ironically the band's singles 'Arnold layne' and 'see Emily play' are actually better than anything on this cd. Both came out that year too. If you like music from that era this is a good one to get. If not it's worth owning to because this kind of stuff is long gone and did have some value but psych rock will never compete with the great prog rock that pink Floyd later became.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|the game is well done and well designed. it is slow to open and gave me the impression that it was hung. over all very good!
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Fun movie kept me guessing to the end. It's fun to see how some of the illusions were done. Great people in it.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Although I'm not a teen or a young adult, I very much enjoyed this trilogy. This final book was the absolute best of the three.  When I first started reading the final book, I wasn't very excited but only because the truth is sometimes hard to take.  Veronica Roth is an amazing writer and can make the reader feel like they are a part of the story.  When Tris made the decision to save her brother, I was in complete shock and disbelief. There were so many different serums referenced in the book that I was certain there would be a &#34;miracle&#34; serum to change the situation. Of course there was none and besides, we couldn't expect anything less from Tris.
0345531965|1.0|John Grisham has obviously made a tourist trip to the Pantanal, a vast wetland region in Brazil that stretches into Bolivia and Paraguay, and made a few notes on the way - jotting down names like the towns of Campo Grande and Corumba, beer brands like Antarctica and Brahma, and a word or two of Portuguese like \\"obrigado\\".<br /><br />He then decided to use this experience in one of his novels that, as usual, portrays unpleasant, greedy individuals who are only interested in gaining obscene amounts of money in the hope of living happily ever after.<br /><br />To season the dish, he adds some improbable characters - a former alcoholic attorney with countless children from countless marriages who is trying to start a new life and falls for a saintly American woman missionary who has dedicated her life to looking after Brazilian Indians, a repulsive American billionaire who throws himself out of the window after altering his will and a snivelling servant who will perjure himself to gain some crumbs from his late boss's fortune.<br /><br />The result is a hotchpotch that is an insult to the reader's intelligence and an ending that just fizzles out and leaves the reader wondering why he has just wasted his time reading the previous 422 pages.<br /><br />I suggest we readers get together and sue Grisham and his publisher for producing such a shoddy piece of work that I imagine is meant to be entertaining.
B00BU1DH1M|5.0|This is classic gritty Rebus. He has returned to the police and has had to accept a sergeants role, now reporting to DI Clarke. Of course he breaks all the rules and is instrumental in solving the crimes that come his way. He even convinces the people from Professional Standards that he has his heart in the right place. I enjoyed it immensely.
B0011N1WE8|4.0|Well worth watching and after you do, then make a decision on getting it or not.The movie is engaging, entertaining and sends a good message. In my opinion, it is worth the buy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like the game that we could win challenges and beat my friends with their scores and I could win the game
1781162646|4.0|Very well done! I bought this for a flight and finished it rather quickly.  It's a nice, fast read.  Suspenseful and entertaining.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Different levels keep you interested in the game.  It can be a challenge for all ages.  I highly recommend adding it as an app.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is a calculator. It works well. I'm not sure what else I can say about it. I use it to balance my checkbook.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I like this book this book in spiritual of all the rateings they  should give it five stars on this book.<br />The only thing I like to see is the first place and time consuming  again.
B004GYY714|5.0|This is one really great app!  Lots of nice bells and whistles and a fantastic selection of channels. I prefer this over the many other competitor apps out there.
B00EW9GQR6|2.0|It's not that Artpop is particularly awful.  It isn't.  It's just so disappointing.....again.  A few of the tracks are likable if not especially groundbreaking (\\"Venus,\\" \\"Do What U Want\\").  One of the tracks is truly great Gaga (\\"Applause\\").  The rest ranges from the boring to the bizarre, but either way qualifies as filler, musical grout.<br /><br />The thing is, this woman's first efforts (\\"Fame\\"/\\"Fame Monster\\") we're so engaging and constantly clever that I've continued to await her new releases, only to be disappointed time after time.  \\"Born This Way\\" was a pretty lousy effort (once again, except for two or three tracks, no more) and \\"Artpop\\" is no better.  At this point, Lady Gaga has worn out my good will as a consumer.  One or two tracks doesn't justify the cost of an album or the time it takes to weed through the chaff.<br /><br />My advice to others: sample the individual tracks for yourself and then buy just the ones you want.  My advice to Lady Gaga: take however long it may take to create an album in which every track is as fine as your best.  The essence of Pop, be it Art or otherwise, is charm and brevity.  Two minutes of pure confection beats fifty minutes of tedium every time.
B005J43I56|2.0|Did not fit my HD Fat Boy handlebar clamp base... The screws are to fin, so they can not be used to fix the ball.
B0050DIWHU|5.0|Well written by the founder of LinkedIn. Great source for all people to read and think of their career.moving forward.
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|This is for GoPro Hero 3. It does not fit Hero 3+<br />The filter adds (turn back) the colors for your shoots underwater. The videos and photos I take with it became astoning. I really like it.<br />It worth be used until 20m (66 ft) or a little more, if you have natural ambient light. If its dark, it will have no advantage, and you will need to use artificial lights. Great for the purpose
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|This is a very entertaining book.  I enjoyed it a lot.  BUT, the word &#34;y'all&#34; is plural!  An innocent mistake, but I really hated reading the parts with the character from Nashville because it rang such a discordant note.  Assuming this will be a series, please, Mr. Sanderson, stop using &#34;y'all&#34; unless the character is addressing more than one person.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Sharpens all of my blades quickly with no hassle, no muss and no fuss. Compact for packing in a backpack, pocket or where ever you keep such small tools when you're out hiking, camping, shooting or whatever. Would buy again.
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|WHITE FIRE is the latest (13th) in the series of novels by Preston and Child starring the irrepressible Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast.  This time around, Pendergast takes a largely supporting role to that of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Corrie Swanson, currently enrolled at the John Jay School of criminal justice. Corrie's search for a thesis project takes her to the ultra-chic resort town of Roaring Fork, CO, in search of the answer to a series of what seem like Grizzly bear attacks nearly 150 years ago, and quickly embroils her in a modern series of arson/murders.<br /><br />This is a welcome change of pace for Pendergast fans from the last trilogy in which Pendergast's long-dead wife Helen reappears, disappears, reappears again, and Pendergast discovers more about Helen and her family than he ever wanted to know, while at the same time exhibiting essentially superhuman strength, endurance and resourcefulness over a 3 book span involving everything from Nazis to plate tectonics.  But this time, it's just a good old murder mystery (or two).<br /><br />There are but brief mentions of long-time supporting cast members Vinnie D'Agosta, Captain Hayward, Proctor or Constance Green.  The focus is tightly restricted to Corrie, and her first real-live (or dead) case.  Just because the stakes do not involve some international conspiracy or threat to the world does not mean that the novel is tame or slow paced.  Quite the opposite.  Because of the concentration on Corrie, the threat of serious bodily harm not excluding the possibility of death makes for quite a tension filled romp thorough the Colorado snow.<br /><br />As an added bonus, an integral part of the story involves a missing Sherlock Holmes short story based on a \\"factual\\" tale told to A. Conan Doyle while he was on a visit to Roaring Fork 150 years ago.  It's fun to see Preston and Child's take on what the \\"long lost\\" (fictional) Sherlock Holmes story would have read like, and how the story fits into the solution of both the old and new crimes.<br /><br />One need not have read the other Pendergast novels to jump right in to this one, as there is little to link it to the others except the backstories of Corrie, Pendergast and their relationship.  Not the best in the series, but very, very good.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />J.M. Tepperhe old and new crimes.<br /><br />One need not have read the other Pendergast novels to jump right in to this one, as there is little to link it to the others except the backstories of Corrie, Pendergast and their relationship.

B0067Q42BY|4.0|Fun game with some good challenges and puzzles to figure out.  I got a little carried away with it, and played the whole thing in two sittings.  I hope it gets updated soon.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|A very believable book. It has caused me to change my diet. I made list of all the foods and ingredients the author recommends. I recommend this book to all adults.
0316017930|4.0|An interesting presentation concerning achievement and what are the reasons some are successful. A different theory than the usual work hard and have inherited abilities.<br />An easy read.
B00FHATBGW|4.0|It is off to a good start. Town is in bad shape. Must find things to get anywhere. It does have some people. I like it so far. Seems to be a good game from what I have seen of it.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|its been a while since i've really enjoyed a horror film. really enjoyed this move.  At least check it out
1451666179|5.0|This book is so exceptionally good that I have purchased 5 copies of it, 1 for myself and 4 others as gifts to people that NEED to see the wisdom and hilarity of Allie Brosh.  I have been a huge fan and all it too was 1 time reading her blog at hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com, she is awesome! So glad the book is out!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|We all love this game in our house. It's fun, addictive and at times frustrating! The only thing I don't like is having to get friends to help you to the next level.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|Would have given it 5 stars, but I've never been able to connect to Facebook.  I noticed other reviews said the same thing.  Just got the update, and haven't played much on it yet.
B00AW57L96|5.0|Another beautifully written book by liane moriarty, it was filled with words that were so descriptive that I felt like I knew them all. It's had twists and changes that I found fascinating, life in the suburbs isn't always a bed of roses. The challenges each person faced and how they handled them was exactly as it would be in real life. I thoroughly enjoyed every chapter. I am really enjoying her other books which are all so different but just as mysterious and exciting. I would highly recommend this author.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|The book started off a little slow, but then became much more interesting after the first couple of chapters. The dialog was excellent, and the writing was very poetic. At times, the author got a little carried away with descriptions, but this only happened in a couple of places. I thought there were several interesting turns in the STORY, and the ending was fantastic. I would definitely recommend this classic to others.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The story was very moving and well told, however i would have enjoyed the book much more without the foul language. Probably will not read another book by this author because of it.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Great little app. I had no issues downloading, installing or operating this app.  It's simple and easy to use, also allows you to store multiple locations.  Up to date, reliable weather info.
B0089LOG02|4.0|A really good readable blend of actual history and fiction.  Characters are real and likeable. Our book club gave it a unanimous thumbs up
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Vic<br />Good book I liked it good author she writes well I look forward to reading more from the same
B00F031WB8|4.0|The documentary is OK, nothing really new here for the hardcore Hendrix fan, also it has a lot of the same old footage seen in every other Hendrix documentary. Janie &#34;Hendrix&#34; seems to want to paint Jimi as a some kind of a saint or choirboy. Anyway, the best part of the dvd is the bonus features. The Miami Pop 1968 footage is good, but the 3 songs are not complete, the New York Pop songs are complete, but not the greatest quality (its nice to see other songs besides Foxey Lady & Star Spangled Banner from this show that have been on bootlegs for years), the 4 songs from Isle of Fehmarn are incomplete as well, but this show wasn't professionally recorded, still its nice to see footage from it...As long as money hungry Janie &#34;Hendrix&#34; has control of Jimi's legacy, unreleased bits and pieces and recycled footage is all us Jimi fans will get
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|The book is a book that you can reread and still enjoy. It is about a dog that is stolen and sold in the north to pull loads for the men looking for gold.
1451648537|5.0|The book does not add many news to what has been written here and there about Steve Jobs, however, it does provide a complete and I suppose fairly accurate summary and insight into the life of the greatest after Leonardo Da Vinci (in my opinion, of course).<br />I recommend reading it and keeping it in the library as a reference
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Awesome. I love the simplicity of this. It takes some getting use to but its worth the learning. enjoy your download. And look for the youtube tutorial.
B005FRF6PC|1.0|This book is boring boring boring. I guess it was written with the purpose of catching the mainstream after Andre Agassi's &#34;Open&#34; which is instead a masterpiece.
B00CNQ7CRI|2.0|I'm not crazy about the book.  I enjoyed Bridget Jones Diary, but this one I put down halfway through.  I got tired of reading it.
B00946WM6Q|5.0|How did I got so long before seeing this movie!? Awesome action flick. The opening act with the professional jumper sucked me in, the ending chewed me up and spit me out.
B0040ZA2D6|5.0|I am very picky about the music that is listened to in our house.  The kids and I love watching BTR on Nick and have also enjoyed their music.  I love that the show and the music is appropriate for teens and is fun to watch and hear.  My kids are younger than teens and I appreciate the good clean fun this has.  Keep up the good work and don't sell out to have to be edgy.  Just keep having fun!
B00GIXWXEO|5.0|Great movie for a kid, entertaining enough for an adult. I love the convenience of renting the movie through your online service. Priced doesn't compete with Redbox, but the convenience and no late fees make up for it.
0385373791|5.0|My son is in 6th grade and he loved this series.  He read them all within a couple of weeks.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book was an excellent read. It was suggested to me by someone that I admire, but someone that didn't strike me as a person that believed in any afterlife. This book made him a believer and therefore I had to read it and I'm glad I did!  To God be the glory!
B00CEF014E|5.0|Wow! What a wonderful thrill ride of suspense and intrigue! This book was very well written and the author's style unique and captivating! This thriller-page turner had me at the first page and didn't let go until the stunning conclusion. I was drawn into the book immediately and wondered where the author was going with this story, but it brings the reader into this bizarre world and never lets up. The kicker is that it is very believable. The characters come alive on the page and drive this wild ride until the very end! Kudos to Stevenson, as the story was well thought out, and very descriptive with great use of language and word choice. I just couldn't put it down. If you love thrillers, stories with plenty of twists and turns, and mysteries that keep you guessing, then this is the book for you! I give it five stars ... and look forward to reading more from this wonderful author!
0811879542|5.0|This little book continues to thrill my daughter (6) and every adult who she asks to read it to her. This has been on her bedside table for two years now. Although she's fully capable of reading the text herself, the magic and thrill seem to be especially strong when she has another narrate the instructions. Who knew that dots could be so mischievous, obedient, interesting, and engaging. Happy pressing!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Played this on Facebook,enjoy this version more.  Better graphics and easier quests.  Definitely a game to pass the time playing.
B008EKMB82|4.0|When you start reading the book you have no idea whats waiting for you. You have to pass the first hurdle and than you slide to the end. A very touching story of a young girl suffering from abuse at school and has family issues. The way the auther deals with this incorporating ideas from buddhism and zen is intriguing.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Good game. Fun. A little confusing at first but easy to catch on. Good graphics. Music gets a little annoying but I just turn it off.
B003L7861E|5.0|A tale about courage and food. Enjoyed the read. A very colorful presentation of life. Read it in two days
1594487154|5.0|While I didn't necessarily &#34;buy&#34; everything Mr. Pink tries to &#34;sell&#34; in his book, he won me over on most of the ideas that he puts forward. The reason I give it 5 stars is because (1) the book is extremely easy to read, (2) the organization is extremely clear and that made it easy to remember a lot of the new information, and (3) the ideas Pink introduces changed the way I view the what and the how of sales. Reading the book actually resulted in a paradigm shift.<br /><br />This is not a how-to book, but there is some of that. I actually found that section more helpful than most of the sales books that I have read. I even included the &#34;Pixar Pitch&#34; on my website. A few ideas really stuck out. The extent to which the information age has changed sales is a major theme. If you are a buyer or a seller, this is worth thinking about. Other ideas that gave me a lot to ponder over included (1) the recent rise in entrepreneurship that will likely continue even more, (2) being a problem finder vs. a problem solver and (3)  the advantages of being an ambivert in sales.<br /><br />Since the book is so accessible and makes an argument that everyone is now involved in sales to some degree, I would recommend To Sell Is Human to anyone. I think at the very least you will find it intriguing, entertaining, and helpful.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I wouldn't consider myself a bookworm and before I've only read books when necessary (i.e for school). Recently I've picked up a few books and actually enjoyed reading again. In the last 2 months I've completed over 40 books and out of all of them, this book really got to me. I don't think I've ever cried so much, I'm not the kind of girl that often shows her emotions but do weep when I read or watch sappy movies. The story starts off pretty slow and this is your &#34;unconventional love story&#34;. Obviously I'd hope there would be a happily ever after as a couple but in the end, there is still a good ending that makes you put in lots of thought as to whether if you were ever to be put in the same situation, what would you do? Few years ago my friends and I was watching a documentary on a guy who slept for over 20 years? and his parents decided to keep in a coma hoping that one day he'll wake up in which he did. We discuss as far as if we were ever put in the situation would we want to live knowing that we'd be a &#34;vegetable&#34;. My boyfriend now fiancee said he'll take care of me if I wasn't able to completely take care of myself. It's very noble of him, but I had suggested that I wouldn't want him to suffer if I was ever put in that position. As much as I love life, if I can't live it then what's the point of living. I'd rather die, than live life in misery and make everyone else live in misery with me.  A very powerful and touching story, a must read
0804137501|5.0|Remote is directed to companies that have rejected or that have only modestly experimented with remote work. Weaving through examples from their own experience with remote employees, and the experience of  other big and small companies, Jason and David present  a compelling argument urging companies to ignore geographies and focus on skill and culture-fit instead.<br /><br />One small nit-pick that would have made Remote even better: I wish Remote spent more time offering concrete advise to companies and people already working remotely on how they can optimize their workflow and interactions among team members. There's a short discussion about this (including a very useful section on security for remote teams, plus a good section of best tools to use for remote work), but that's not the main focus of this book.<br /><br />Remote is an outstanding book for companies and individuals who haven't considered or are on the fence about remote work. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />My full review: [...]
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very fun, interesting, and I could play for hours with this game. I first started playing on facebook, and was hooked from the first play! A must have for a game!

B000SEGMAU|5.0|I'm from Michigan and knew Mr. Albion before reading this book.......twice. I've tried to come up something witty to say, but cannot!! All I can say though is I've cried and I learned. Great book!!
0321811984|5.0|This is a great book, it was required reading for a graduate course.  The information is useful and it's easy to read.  This book is a must read for anyone making presentations!
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Really Fun! It's a fast paced game that tests your ability to keep up with the game. I got my cousin addicted very quickly with this game and she loves it a lot. She recommends this game for anyone who plays it or wants to play it
B00GOQ9M4O|1.0|There is so much to be seen back at the prison, but we had to follow this awful side story...this whole show is becoming a big ol' disappointment. This might have been the last hour I am willing to commit.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I love building games but I've found I don't like a lot of these type of game that are available, but this one is very fun to play. I also love the graphics.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Great book. Love it. I would make love to it if I could. Too bad it's a digital version and not real. Lots of sticky pages.

B000N2HCM4|5.0|Truthful. Factual. Much insight into our government, where it has been and where it is headed.  The portion I found most rewarding was Barack's account of his Christian faith and his acceptance of Jesus Christ into his life.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I was looking forward to seeing how this story would wrap up......needless to say I am not real pleased with the non-ending of this story! At some point we need to give these two some closure. I hope we get that in the next....and last!?....book.
B002ZG999U|5.0|Oh man was this a fun movie!<br /><br />At one point I leaned over to one of my buddies and said, &#34;Best. Movie. Ever.&#34; Really. Actually, it probably isn't the best movie ever. But it was a nice throwback to the good old days of 80's movies that I grew up watching.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is one of the best APPs I have used for my study time, reading time and listening time. I currently am enrolled in 3 bible plans: Reading the bible Chronological, Major People of the Bible and NIV Live 30 Day Audio bible.<br /><br />Whether you are looking to enhance your study time for school, church or personal this APP has everything you could possibly need. Initially I was not happy with this APP because it listed several version but I didn't have access to them. I realized if you want that type of variety you have to download that content via Wi-Fi then when offline you will have it.<br /><br />While in church I can have the very Scripture my pastor is referencing built into my notes and for me that is huge. It saves time on my having to type it out.<br /><br />Now they have this same APP for children, OUTSTANDING!!!
B001AGXEAG|5.0|The movie is dark without being scary and funny without being ridiculous.  I loved this moving growing up and my dad loves the banana boat song at the end. Great movie!
B000FA675C|5.0|Love it.  Keeps you reading to the very end.  Better than the movie. Lots of details and intrigue to keep the reader reading.

B00CH26TL8|1.0|How frustrating to play a game that gives you absolutely no where to click to get instructions or to even find the object of the game!  For an hour I just aimed and shot to see what would happen.  Tough to upgrade your level when you can't even find out how to improve it!  I don't do Facebook like many other people.  You're screwed if you have to be there to get info.  :(
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|I thought this was the best Superman movie yet. Obviously oriented toward those not familiar with the Superman story as it starts from the very beginning. If you are looking for a sequel, this is not it. If you want to see a remake of the Superman story that is very well done then you might like this movie. If you are the type to nitpick a movie for its faults then skip this movie, if you like comic book characters come to life then you will probably like this movie. The characters are well done, decent acting and great special effects make this an entertaining movie.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|Hey guys to get the update on kindle fire uninstall the app and reinstall it. You will have the updated version and all of your progress and neighbors will still be there.
B000N2HCKQ|5.0|Well written and entertaining. I've enjoyed reading Made to Stick. It's been an eye-opening book about the anatomy of ideas, and who some stick, while others falter. My academic background is psychology, but I had never given much thought to why certain ideas stick with us. Made to Stick has helped me understand a lot more about the way we grasp ideas, and how I can communicate ideas more effectively to other people.

B00GH4RKYM|1.0|This is absolutely the worst Superman movie I've ever seen. After the 750th building exploded I figured out the director's vision was nothing but CGI. No character development, no meaningful plot, just one big fight scene  between the \\"good\\" guy and the \\"bad\\" guy. I was bored to tears.
B001UW58WW|5.0|We LOVE David Garrett in our house.. This guy is so talented it is crazy!  We love the classical with the mix of hip-hop, jazz, blues, etc... that he incorporates into his violin explosion! You got to listen to this guy!

0316074314|3.0|Winning a prize for literature simply means that a small elite group liked the book more that others in the list. What makes a novel good are the insights that it provides on people and cultures. Bearing this in mind I was not overly impressed with Elanor Caton's effort - I got very little from the effort it took to read it. I understand that one of the Booker judges said that reading the book was akin to being immersed in a warm bath. I agree - sleep inducing!<br /><br />I stopped and started to read the book five times- each time it either overwhelmed me or bored me. Discipline and effort were necessary each time to resume the task. I became tired of the artifices the author used to try to draw the reader back into the plot because of the its length and complexity. It seemed that words were being written for the sake of writing them on many occasion and to claim that an editor's blue pencil would destroy the structure of the novel is to belittle the skill of a good editor.<br /><br />Finally, I have finished the tome and feel that it was simply not worth all that effort - although I do appreciate the desire of the author to demonstrate her ability to handle complexity!
B003O86FMW|3.0|Although story line is full of violence and has no futuristic vision or ideas. However it is a smooth read and I finished it very fast.
B00BR9WQ32|5.0|&#34;Man's Search for Meaning&#34; is superb.<br /><br />Of all of the concentration camp memoires I have read so far, this one intrigues me the most. It is sincere, simple and unapologetic.<br /><br />Parts II and III, which were written in later years as Frankl was processing his grief, his experiences, and his thoughts about moving on with his life. are written in a more formal academic style, contain a lot of interesting ideas and Frankl's theories on what he called &#34;logotherapy.&#34; Interesting thoughts that to allow those who have suffered to acknowledge their past but instead of reliving the misery,  to lacknowledge the power of choice and to ook hopefully towards the future.<br /><br />Kim Burdick<br />Stanton, Delaware

B00DQC2FPM|5.0|This is a really cool Lego set.  It looks great and comes with a lot of extra parts so you can make all three versions of the DeLorean Time Machine!<br /><br />My only complaints really are about the figures themselves.  Doc Brown is fine, but I wish he had some kind of accessory from the films.  Marty is fine too, but they randomly gave him a purple regular skateboard instead of his awesome pink flying one.
B00EO4SBSG|4.0|So, Trivium has returned with their 6th album and it is...different. It is still undeniably Trivium, but it's got some very different things from the previous album(s). First up, it is less complex when compared to more than half of the previous album as well as their whole discography. They've always been a complex band musically. Next up, the vocals are extremely, extremely strong! Matt's vocals are bursting with confidence and he has never sounded stronger vocally. The only thing is that there are noticeably less rough vocals. The vocals are mostly clean sung, however, they aren't the same gruff style as The Crusade, they are just plain clean vocals. The music as I said is less complex, but that doesn't mean it isn't still heavy, nor that it doesn't still have some technically advanced passages. The drumming on this album is incredible and some songs feature some of Trivium's BEST riffs and solos ever.<br /><br />The Music:<br /><br />1. Brave This Storm- This song starts off right in your face, the shredding riffing is extremely in your face. Then it goes into a groove passage and Matt's voice comes in extremely confidently. This song definitely starts the album off on a good note. The verse has more of a slower, groove metal approach (akin to Sevendust) and then the chorus has melodies and technical stuff like the Trivium I'm used to hearing. All in all, it actually doesn't sound very simplistic. Definitely a good, solid track. I like it! Good tune!<br /><br />2. Vengeance Falls- This title track fits the \\"stripped down\\" description. The first one really didn't fit that description. The riffing in this one's verse has an alternative metal chug feel to it. It isn't terrible, but I'm not a fan of this song because it does sound stripped down. A huge amount of this album doesn't sound stripped down like people say, but this track does. The chorus doesn't really have much on it and the verses are alright. There is one part of the song that is cool, but it doesn't make this song any better. Not a bad track, but not a stellar one.<br /><br />3. Strife- The single of the album. This one's intro might sound a tad bit simple, but I feel that this song is definitely a stronger track of the album. This one gets your head banging, the riffing sounds intense and heavy, and the song has dynamics; it changes feel throughout. The drumming on it is top notch, the guitars are above expectations (after hearing the intro to it), and the vocal performance is one of the album's finest. This is one of the album's strongest tracks, especially in the guitar solo area; the soloing is EXTREMELY good! Sounds just like a Trivium solo should! Great song! Great choice as a single!<br /><br />4. No Way to Heal- This right here is EASILY, and I do mean WITHOUT A DOUBT, the BEST SONG on this album and one of Trivium's best EVER! The guitar intro is very melodic and definitely brings out the influence of Iron Maiden & In Flames. The verse of this song is intense and this is the first song of the album to have Matt doing screams as the lead vocal. The guitars are probably the most technical on this song! The vocals are the strongest on here, the drums are the most intense, the guitars show no mercy, but the melody is there with all this aggression. Easily the album's best song, my favorite song on here, and this song is one of Trivium's best songs ever written. If you only buy one song from this album, make it this one!!! *sounds more technical than some of the songs on In Waves*<br /><br />5. To Believe- This one follows the previous track quite nicely. The intro sounds epic, but not in the same way. The verse is heavy and fits the \\"stripped down\\" label, but the song itself isn't all simple. It remains pretty heavy and carries a good groove behind it. The headbang factor of this song matches the single, Strife. This one is also one of the album's strongest tracks due to the shifts in feel through it. The verse is slower and heavier and the chorus is more frantic and epic. The bridge is very melodic and grooving at the same time. I have to say that this song is probably the most likely to be release as another single. It's got that vibe to me. It's good nevertheless, fantastic actually.<br /><br />6. At the End of This War- This song starts off with an acoustic guitar part and then Matt's voice comes in. Matt's voice is beautiful. It was always good, but he's mastered it just as he's mastered his guitar. He knows what he's doing all the way. The song then turns into another heavy song that really gets your head moving with it. This song is just as strong as the previous ones. It has really strong guitars, extremely strong vocals, and good drumming. The bass on this one is also great. This one also calls out to me that it has potential to be released as a single. The accessibility to the song is great, but it still carries that signature Trivium sound with the technical riffs and melodic guitars (though no other song on this album, not even this one, comes close to touching \\"No Way to Heal\\" in terms of technicality). Great song!<br /><br />7. Through Blood and Dirt and Bone- This one stats off with a really cool guitar melody. Then it gets heavier and more grooving. Matt's vocals are still goin' strong on this song as well. The guitar riffs through this one aren't as technical, but they are by no means simple either. The chorus one this one is pretty epic as well. The whole album has a dark vibe to it, but this song just seems to have one of the most sinister atmospheres of them all. I LIKE IT!!! This song is really good. Check it out!<br /><br />8. Villainy Thrives- The opening riff to this one is a lot lighter until it bursts open into a heavy grooving song. This song has room to grow on me, but at the moment, it's only ok. It has that simple approach and it wouldn't be so bad if the chorus wasn't so bland. Honestly that's what brings it down. For being simple, the verse sounds good. It hints an alternative metal type riff, but the rest of the song doesn't have that vibe. It's an alright song. Not a big one for me.<br /><br />9. Incineration: The Broken World- The opening riff to this one sounded cool to me the first few times I heard it, but it only grows more stale every time I hear it. The rest of the song isn't exactly bad, but it isn't necessarily good. The screams are in this one, but the music really doesn't do much to help support that fact. Other than the verse, it really doesn't sound that epic or heavy. People have been saying David Draiman's presence gave the whole record a Disturbed vibe. This is the only song that even has evidence of a Disturbed vibe. That's probably what it is. Not the best song here...<br /><br />10. Wake (The End is Nigh)- At first I thought the title was a typo, but nigh is another word for near. This one starts off with a light guitar part and Matt's vocals come in and sound as light as the guitar. I love the way this song builds up. It is a very appropriate last track because it starts off light and builds until the end. When the rest of the band comes in during the chorus, it has an erie feel to it and then after the first chorus, a giant shredding fest starts. The next verse then has an epic groove to it. The vocals in this song are among the best on the album. Very dynamic performance. The song then bursts into a melodic guitar part and Matt's voice goes over it. This was a pleasant surprise the first time I heard it and it really sounds great! The solo passages on this song are also really expressive. The closing of the song leaves a positive feeling and then it fades away. Great last song. This is probably the 2nd best song.<br /><br />Verdict- Many reviews say that Draiman's presence ruined Trivium's sound on this album. He didn't have a single song-writing credit on here. If anything his presence helped. He worked with Matt to help him better his songwriting and his singing. Would ya look at that, this album has some of the best lyrics and THE best vocals of any Trivium album! Sure, it may not be as technical as the previous albums, but I have to say, I really like it. As an album, it is an extremely easy listen, but a heavy one! Great album. To me, it has many of the elements that made In Waves such a good album, but it is different than In Waves. It's a great buy for any Trivium fan! Go get your copy today!<br /><br />I've only listened to In Waves and this one all the way through and they are both neck and neck, neither one is superior to the other. Both are fantastic albums for different reasons; In Waves just had a large collection of good, strong songs and it flowed relatively well, but it also had variety. This one has many styles intermixed effortlessly into cohesive songs and the album has much better flow, but it doesn't have as many strong songs as the previous album. Both are great buys however! Just wanted to put my comparison in here at the bottom!<br /><br />Happy Shopping!

B003PJ6UHA|3.0|I find the concept of biocentrism to be compelling.  QM casts a really strange light onto the nature of reality, and consciousness obviously plays some role in things that happen \\"outside\\" of oneself.<br /><br />Some low reviews of this book were short and didn't (in my opinion) adequately explain what was wrong with the book, aside from just casting judgments at it.  As this is a controversial theory, I expected as much, which is why the wide range of reviews didn't necessarily put me off.  Some of the other low reviews are clearly from people who already know what they think.  Likewise some of the positive reviews I saw were pretty useless and/or gave into people's confirmation bias.<br /><br />I would like to believe that biocentrism is true.  I think there is some elegance to it, and the authors are certainly passionate about it.  The main issue that I had with it is that I was never fully satisfied that consciousness couldn't be disregarded by science (i.e. the status quo) as being just an effect of such a complicated makeup of the brain.  In other words, a skeptic could take the position that our subjective experience is simply an effect of the complexity of our brains and current inability to quantify it into something tangible.  I think that it's necessary for the authors to explain (and provide more evidence for) why consciousness is by itself the cornerstone of reality and not just a bag of complexity.  It seemed like more of an inductive proof of it being so than anything.  And that is not going to satisfy skeptics.  Like, I want evidence that demonstrates that consciousness can't be explained by physical processes.<br /><br />That aside, biocentrism does seem to explain concepts that the current state of theoretic physics can't get to, such as the GUT.  And I really, really liked the idea that anything bendable (e.g. space and time) isn't fundamental.  +1 for that.<br /><br />Is this theory worth further consideration and experimentation?  Absolutely.  Would I like to see more evidence and compelling arguments for some of the assertions made here?  Absolutely.

B00ESF285S|5.0|Over thirty years have passed since I've read this book; over 30 until this morning. I've just finished reading this book to my nine month old daughter only a few minutes ago. Oh, the Places You'll Go! has such a powerful and priceless message for children and adults. We make choices every day, bad things will happen and it's up to us to learn from it and move on. Good things will happen and enjoy those times. I'd recommend this book for anyone, any age, whether they have children or not. It'll definitely make adults think of their own  crossroads and teach kids that they'll experience life's choices offered at their feet in their imminent future.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Mainly hidden object, but still basic story to follow. Good graphics, no glitches I've noticed at all. No need to pay for anything unless you just want to speed it up. I usually play just to unwind for sleep and don't normally run out of free play that way.

B00DT99BX6|4.0|I imagine that the competition in the arena of romance novels is pretty stiff, so much so that a debut author could have a tough time cracking the code to get his or her share of the readership.  A smart new writer would do what Chameleon has done and added a mixture of non-romance-generic subplots guaranteed to draw the interest of those readers hungry for something new, but non-paranormal, in the romance genre.  Here it is… action and adventure in abundance, provide a thriller format to the standard theme of boy gets girl, or in this case – determined woman gets her man.<br /><br />This is the story of a bold, young rich woman who is tired of being constantly hounded by bodyguards that her doting father insists upon, but has never told her why.  Unaware of the risks, Camille often “sneaks” away from her guards to take short vacations at far-flung locations around the world.  During one of these, she meets the man of her dreams who promptly saves her from being kidnapped.<br /><br />The danger, the tension, the father’s determination to keep secrets all combine with the strong desires of Camille and the reluctant lover’s desire to keep “hands off”, to create an action packed thriller.  At times, the action and suspenseful situations push the romantic themes off stage, but not for long.  As soon as the urgency of the numerous fight and escape scenes subsides… the romance is back full force along with the mystery surrounding the attacks, and her would be lovers’ reticence to give in to Camille’s desires.  An ending that is not unexpected, yet different due to the sub-plots, lend this book a foot up on other romance tales.  I highly recommend this for romance fans, and for those who enjoy a bit of excitement outside the bedrooms, as well.

B00498YZH8|2.0|This was a slow moving story. It was missing a critical point as it never showed you a picture of the person that they are searching for, therefore you could not participate in the search. Also had a lot of unnecessary shots that had nothing to do with what was going on.

B00G4PX1MO|5.0|More levels, heroes, and enemies.  26 levels, like 15 heroes, three free heroes, and like 4 pages of enemies!  This is better than first one.  Has heroes that you choose what gets upgraded and keep their levels.  More mercenaries and better story of what happens.
B00ENXBUR2|5.0|This looks awesome up on my Media Shelf. The movie was amazing and the extra features are very interesting! It is really cool to see how different scenes were shot and the depth that the Production team went into to create this take on an American Classic Superhero film
B007EECSFA|5.0|Possibly one of the best mysteries I've read. Twists and turns right to the end. A definite must read. Couldn't put it down.
B008NA2JMQ|1.0|I didn't enjoy this at all. the only reason I finished was because it was a book club book. This man is a narcissistic tool. I regret spending money on this book to make him richer.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It is very hard to say how i really feel about this book in words. The author makes you feel, makes you reevaluate your life. To be brave, strong and appreciate the little things. I tried not to cry, i failed. This is a very beautiful and awesome book, that everybody needs to read.
B0055N0FZM|4.0|I can't even think of words to describe this book. I really appreciated how after her diary ended there was updated information to receive information about all the people we had come to know through Anne's eyes. I highly recommend it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|LOVE LOVE this game!! Would be awesome if the updates were caught up though&middot; Unable to go any further until then. Anyone know if there's a way to update it like it's on the iPhone?
B00DHHFKE4|5.0|I loved this! I devoured it in 2 days. I'm normally a slow reader. It's interesting to see how different the &#34;real&#34; characters in the book are compared to the TV show versions. They seem like two different stories, which is great, no spoilers by watching/reading one before the other. For someone who's not a writer, it's a really well written memoir,
B00CWVBV4E|5.0|GREAT for Kids and hilarious for adults! My Husband and son all really enjoyed the movie! Really worth the buy!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game! So excited to have this app. Have it on my kindle fire HD and it works great! Such an addicting game.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Very good game to play. The level are fun to get to. It is easy to play and fun too.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really really fun! you try to win games to get<br />games. it is really fun I am going to get THE HD oneself
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I have read this book three times and I always take away something new from it. Also, I have given this book as a gift to friends and family who are facing challenges.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Wish I could play it all day so addicting. I play when I get the chance. The only thing that gets me down is no more lives lol
B004ZH66XO|5.0|Grow is my most favorite game in the world! I.love.it.It's the best game on my Kindle!Best of all,the stuff in the shop is  FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!yay!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|As an engineer/producer, I recommend this app. Very easy to use even as a beginner. I use this app everyday to make professional advertising images and more. Trust me, you will like it. Just take your time and put some good creativity into it.
B001NHNG64|3.0|If you want an airport thriller this book will not disappoint. That is it... Don't spoil it by expecting more. Enjoy.
B00ANA27IU|5.0|I just finished this one!  What a book!  I will be reading a lot more of Mr. Clarke's work.  I saw the movie, but hadn't read the book.  The book is TERRIFIC and I highly recommend it!  The movie was great, but I think my imagination and ability to translate words into picture in my mind is better than anything the movie makers can do.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|VERY fun. My daughter loves horses and this game is a fun way to teach a five year old about caring for horses.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This is the book to read if you want to learn history.  I am a Christian and I believe the Scriptures; however, I also like to know the actual, historical background.  This is the book to read to put WITH one's knowledge of Scripture and learn about what actually was going on at the time.  It appears to be very well researched and footnoted.
1400052181|5.0|Very interesting book. Incredible amounts of research and patience are obvious. Well written. A story that needed to be told.
B005IYNQAY|4.0|I am probably a minority but enjoyed this one better than Enders Game, the writing is much more mature and it reads more like  Adult Sci Fi.  Some interesting concepts with the piggies life cycle, although not all are told to us in this one.  My only issue was that the math behind Enders age does not really work for me.  3000 years and only aging 20 years does not seem possible even with the space travel at the speed of light.  Long periods of acceleration on multiple trips, and time spent on the various planets have to have aged him more than that.  Of course, I am no expert so maybe I am wrong.  Also, getting rich on interest in banks, even 3000 years of interest won't make you rich, at least not in our world today.  Interest is not much more than the current inflation rate.  Of course, maybe they have a better financial system in the future.<br /><br />The long gap in Enders life between the end of Enders Game and this one is also a minor drawback, although it gets filled in with the last book in the series and on a need to know basis in this one, so it did not bother me that much.  And I thought it hard to understand a scientist hiding the truth from another scientist that she had close ties to, in order to protect him, and not recognizing that knowledge is the best safeguard in that situation.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Adam Lambert is a great musician and entertainer.  This album is just as good as his previous one.  I'm very happy I bought it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Hi, My name is Trinity and I am on my nana's kindle. I am in sixth grade and in english my teacher, Mrs.Boltz is making us read Wonder… At first I thought Oh great another boring school novel I will have to read... But after about ten to twenty chapters in I realized this book is amazing. Not only is it amazing but I can related to it because my uncle is mentally challegned and is in a mechanical wheelchair and everytime I go out in public with him I feel a little like Via (the sister of the boy with the facial disformitty) because everyone is staring at him and people talk about him right in front of his face like he can't hear them... and its sad because people treat him, a 34 year old man like a 4 year old child. I absouletly love this book and I can not thank the author enought because not only is she telling a story about a boy with a facial disformitty she is showing kids and adults what it feels like to be different and what it feels like to go through what he is going through and be bullied and picked on.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|A real page turner. Lost my weekend because I could not put it down. I highly recommend and enjoyed the technology.
B006C45MRE|4.0|Good actors and a good script make for a Good Movie ! Characters were believable--and who's to say there weren't some gold-mining aliens out there in the Wild West somewhere ? 4.5 stars !
B0088EDMMS|5.0|I gave it this rating because it's a great great great movie. Shipping and handling was as expected. Now I can watch my fav Halloween movie anytime I want.
1551525143|5.0|Gorgeous. Julie Maroh truly captures what it is to be a queer woman and coming of age. It is fiction and so the story can be a bit over the top at times. Yet this does not take away from the subtlety and beauty within the events that unfold. Clementine goes from inexperienced to an awakened teen in love. Clementine and Emma experience a great, passionate, intense, tumultuous love. Read it! The artwork is incredible.
B00G32TD98|5.0|Scariest movie I've seen in a long time! Was on the edge of my seat the whole time! Scarier than the fourth kind!
0762445262|4.0|i ordered this for my Grandson and although he really likes it, for some reason i thought it was going to be bigger. The LED does shine brightly for how small it is though.
B00DHHWYAW|5.0|Two movies came to mind as I was watching this 3D spectacle: Citizen Kane and The Wizard of Oz. For all its visual panache it is at heart a psychological spiral into the mind of a man. Obsessed. Transfixed. Driven. Alone. Utterly alone.<br /><br />The distortion of money looms over it all. Vast amounts and none at all. Motivations abused. The screenplay is joyfully literary in its use of language. Perhaps too much is told rather than shown but the descriptions, the adjectives are to be savored.<br /><br />The 3D side of the effect suffers from being a letterbox widescreen aspect ratio (black bar top and bottom) even on my 100\\" projection screen. It is on a par with Hugo 3D but nowhere near Avatar. It is, after all, a domestic story even if the domestic settings are large mansions upon a river bank.<br /><br />Perhaps its greatest accolade is that I'm looking forward to seeing it again. Maybe I shall have a different focus as I view the 2D blu ray disc also supplied with this version of the movie. A man doomed by his inability to see himself. Unlike the narrator. A writer.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|If you are someone that loves fighting and loves taking care of army's this game is perfect for you it has it all you can vs other players or be there friends
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love this if you're heavy Youtube user like us.  Also love the option to watch shows and movies via Google Play.  Initially thought about getting a Roku but Roku has no Youtube so that eliminated that choice.  Very simple and easy to use.  Love it for what it does.  Love it even more for the $35 price
0316322407|5.0|This book was extremely enlightening as to conditions in Pakistan.  As the Taliban is alive and growing in the world, I would highly recommend reading this book in order to become better informed.
B006WPWH4E|5.0|Great fun playing this game, always played the real game with my Dad watching or me watching him, just to see if we could complete it.
0783230370|1.0|I was excited to see this childhood favorite with Arnold Schwarzenegger but instead received a beyond awful horror movie with the same name. I love horror movies, so I thought maybe it wouldn't be so bad, but it really sucked. A lot. This was a sad day for me :(
B003G4W49C|5.0|Awesome read. The pages turn themselves. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the struggles of growing up a genius and the power that lies in wait when that genius is revealed.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is not a think piece. What it is: a totally fun read! Thick with many of my favorite things... action, suspense, computer games, & 80's pop culture. I would've given it 4 stars but the surprise inclusion of my favorite band, Rush, put it over the top. Good job, Mr. Cline!
B00FHB7398|5.0|I'm at a loss for words to describe this game. It is yet another satisfying venture into the creative minds of Big Fish Games developers. They have continued to keep me satisfied with this Web of Deceit: Black Widow, an excellent game.<br />There were a few times I thought that the game was almost over, yet to find this far from the truth. I have still not completed it, but felt compelled to share my thoughts so others might purchase this interesting and sometimes challenging game.<br />I had an easy download on my kindle fire 8.5 HD and the game has played flawlessly. To enter a new area you'll need to double tap, and there is a bit of back &amp; forth for every scene. A map and journal are provided, as are hints.<br />  Simply Wonderful :-D
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This book is phenomenal. I've read it twice since I purchased it. Each time I find something new to take away. If you want a powerful story but an easy read this book is for you. Even if you are looking for a way to deal with someone passing tske up this book you won't have any regrets.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so easy my three year old can occupy herself for a long time. In fact, I think she might be better than me. Great fun for he whole family.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|At first, not sure where it was headed. But, brought together beautifully. Good story and great insight into our human flaws and vulnerabilities.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|Great movie, THIS IS WHAT SUPERMAN SHOULD LOOK LIKE ON THE BIG SCREEN! Only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because lack of special features, which shouldn't be a problem for most.
B0035O66CO|5.0|I remember this film when it first came out in black and white in a technicolor 'movie' world.  It was and still is an amazing movie.<br /><br />When I left the theater, I knew that little girl, Tatum O'Neil would win the Academy Award for her performance.  Everybody I talked to about the movie at the time did not think so because of her youth and because the movie was filmed in black and white.  I understood the director's decision to leave it in black and white because it portraited the period better that way.  It mattered, not to me, that the little girl was so young.  She had a natural talent and that is what I knew would get her the Academy Award.  I was not surprised when I was proven right.  I still smile every time I think about that movie: after all, IT WAS ONLY A PAPER MOON.<br /><br />I must admit that I didn't take to Tatum O'Neil's other endeavors as an actress but I'll always remember that little girl playing out her role in PAPER MOON.
B000W93CHC|5.0|The bold strong female C aris  balanced by the clever intellect of Merthin.  The inn keepers and wool merchants become like a family memory as the pages of world without end  turn. I laughed and cried and the struggles with dire poverty and illness. I have come to the end feeling grateful of my lot in life and in awe at the everyday workload just for the average person to earn his or her bread. Thank you  Mr. Follet for the opportunity to take this journey back in time and space to life England.
B00G9U7R2O|2.0|I am not a child but I love these types of movies.  Usually they are so funny.  Usually.  I don't think anyone at any age will find this boring movie funny....and I couldn't wait for it to come out on video.  What a let down.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|remarkably complete on its historical perspective. Helps explain peoples attitudes during the first 20 years of the 20th century. If you start it you will complete it.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Very Good album. Takes it back to the good days of Marshall Mathers. Haven't listened to anything else since I purchased it.
1577314808|5.0|Excellent, I'm on my second read through.  I keep it on my night stand and refer to it often.  Lot's of parallels to other author's including Richard Rohr
B00CE3IC74|5.0|These tags are an exceptional value for the quality and quantity. They all worked flawlessly out of the package and are of great quality. 11 PVC tags and a keychain for $14 is a wonderful deal. I would highly recommend this for anyone interested in NFC tags. Great starter kit to learn how to use them and what some of the limitations of NFC tags are.
B00CNQ7HAU|1.0|Excellent book;great and fair ending<br /><br />Rating is 100;grisham\\" books are the best;anxiously waiting for next book;star rating the given. Fantastic!!!!!
B000MVN8GK|4.0|Veronica Mars has fantastic character development and always keeps me intruiged in the plot, working to solve the cases alongside Veronica.  Season 3 took a downturn, in my opinion, from the first two seasons but it's still fantastic.
B00DW475CC|1.0|I love this movie, but the new blu ray transfer is terrible.  First, I noticed that the video is a lot darker overall.  Then, as other reviewers have said, there is one scene about 28 minutes in where a previous scene is inserted.  Plus, there are several places throughout the video where bits of scenes are cut out, and dialog is missing and where one scene's dialog bleeds over to another scene.  I owned a non blu ray version and it's perfect.  This blu ray is being returned to Amazon.  Apparently, this is a problem with all of them, not just mine.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|This season is just as good as the first. The character development continues and the plot continues to thicken.  Veronica Mars is easily one of my favorite shows. Once I start watching I have to make sure I have nothing planned for the next few days because I don't want to do anything but investigate with Veronica.  If you haven't watched Veronica Mars, you should. There's no show like it.
B00E0SX118|5.0|I was incredibly skeptical about this film but it is so stinking cute. As I was watching it, I kept thinking how familiar the animation was and lo and behold it is by the guy who did my favorite Lilo and Stitch and How to Train Your Dragon. It is really adorable, clean and funny. A great family film for all ages.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|This is a great Linkin Park album.  Their latest album, Recharged, is largely a remix of Living Things.  I like Living Things better than Recharged except for for the song &#34;A light that never comes&#34;.  It is a great remix.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Some books have been written to be read, while some novels will be remembered just because they are better. Then there is Preston & Child,, they have taken 'WHITE FIRE' to another level. Better then 'RELIC', I think so. This one continues to twist and turn with a suspense level that has no end!
B000FVE3A2|5.0|I have a few other watches that I really like but after I got this Grand Diver, I haven't worn any of them. This is my go to watch everyday. It's sporty and casual but also looks great with a suit. It fits great and the size is perfect. Not too bulky and not too small. I love that is an automatic. It's very accurate on the time and I have never had any issues with it. If anything every happens to it, I would only replace it with the exact same model.
B00130VLZ4|3.0|It fits my camera but it doesn't not allow room to easily maneuver the camer in.  You have to be sure to have it aligned perfectly and it would fit.  It would be better if they make it even 5 mm bigger so it's easier to put the camera in.
B0058VW36U|4.0|My son and I both like this game. I got a bit tired of it after awhile, but he still loves it. It's fun, quick to pick up, and even though it starts out easy enough it does challenge you along the way.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|There is no better way for me to start off a review of breaking bad other than saying Yea B*****!!! I love this show so much I've decided this will be the first thing I review on amazon. Note here I am reviewing the series not the particular box set and it's packaging as it's not yet been released but I have seen every episode of this show and let me tell you it is worth picking up today. From the beginning pitch of the show series creator and executive produce Vince Gilligan was set out to create a show that turns Mr. Chips into Scarface. In the first episode we see by Walter White (Bryan Cranston)'s explanation of chemistry that this is a show about change, and boy are you in for a thrill ride. The story revolves around Walter White, an extremely over qualified chemistry teacher with little money who discovers at age 50 he has terminal lung cancer, what a way to start off a show. He has a wife Skyler (Anna Gunn), a son, Walt Jr. (RJ Mitte), with cerebral palsy, and sister and brother in law Marie (Betsy Brandt) and Hank Schrader (Dean Norris) the latter of which works for the DEA. After seeing a meth lab bust on a ride along with Hank, Want decides to cook methamphetamine to raise money for his family's future after he's passed along with former student and druggie Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul). That's just the first episode. What follows is the a combination of the best acting, writing, and direction a show's had in a long time. With so much reality tv clogging up the channels it is nice to see something as fantastic as Breaking Bad. I do not want to give away many plot points as I'd like you to enjoy the series as much as you can with out spoilers but I do want to touch on a few characters. This show is so good even the most minor of characters will leave a lasting impression. Wendy the meth w****, for example is only in a few episodes but you will remember the moments she is on screen. Other great character of the series include Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), a criminal lawyer who really defines the title, Gustavo &#34;Gus&#34; Fring (Giancarlo Esposito), owner of a fast food restaurant chain and a whole lot more, Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), The guy who get's things done, and many others including Jesse's friends Skinny Pete and Combo, Hank's Partner Gomez, and a crazy sociopath Todd. This is a show that will make you laugh and make you cry. If you like to watch TV, and don't mind if things get a bit heavy, do yourself a favor and pick up this show, you won't be disappointed. I can honestly say it's one of the best things I've ever watched. So good I had to start typing this review here and tell the world but as I said I don't wanna give away too much (other than the pilot i've summarized and some of the characters) so go pick this up, put it in your player, and try to stop watching after the first episode I bet you won't be able too.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad they finally made candy crush for the kindle fire.  I love this game it is addictive and tons of fun.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Though it doesn't seem to get interesting until 80% has gone by, the ending will have an amazing impact on everything. An absolutely BREATHTAKING, SCARY AMAZING series and books. Thank you, Veronica Roth, for these. Be brave;)
B0044XRIMW|1.0|LOVE THE MOVIE - HATE INSTANT VIDEO.<br /><br />constantly freezes, difficult to fast forward or rewind.<br /><br />WIll never do instant video again.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is more than a five star rating. I love the book you will to but read the first book. If you like action, drama, and excitement then read this now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Love this stylus with the 3 different size tips.  It works wonderful with the Kindle HD and with smart phones.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Just downloaded the game it's been a lot of fun so far I haven't had to spend a dime of my money
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love this game. It is totally addicting. I grab my coffee & this game first thing every morning. Keep the great games coming.
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|I have not played a lot of mobile games, but of the dozen or so, this is the one I keep coming back to. Easy to play for a few minutes or blow an hour or two.
B001LX2J22|5.0|you gotta love anthony hopkins as Hannibal.  Edward Norton is one of my favorite actors, he plays this role well.  Good lead in to Silence of the Lambs.
0316322407|5.0|Amazing, inspirational story of courage. This should be read by every single girl in the world. There are those who hate the idea of education, but reading this you get the feeling that this child was driven to excel against all odds. Raised in a poor village with no running water, sanitation with a foul stream running through, Malala had the bravery to face fate head-on. By the way, I am an author and had to put everything on hold to read this book. Impossible to put down. Taliban.... you should be ashamed for a thousand years to come.
B00E9P959O|5.0|The original release had alway seemed unclear to me, a mix of a lot of unclear noise. This remix is so clear now, you can pick out each of the instruments.
B0042RJWTC|1.0|Item was not new. It was in plastic wrap, but didn't look like factory seal. The back cover was ripped and I had to tape it otherwise it would fall completely off. Discs were out of order and out of it's pocket. Some of the discs freeze and have scratches. May have been opened and burned and resealed. Captions don't work and it doesn't sound like a brand new dvd. Not very happy.
0756407125|5.0|This book is a great follow up to The Name of the Wind. It continues Kvothe's story. It brings in more adventures, more places on the map, nicely done characters, funny moments, interesting cultures, and beautiful interactions. You can really tell that the world is fully fleshed out.<br /><br />I don't know how the author is going to get everything wrapped up in only one more book, and I would not doubt that the three days mentioned are just for Kvothe's back story and that more books will come out about &#34;current day.&#34;<br /><br />Note: I listened to the first book on audio and partway through it I knew I'd read it again and wanted that book and the rest, so I bought the actual books. However, the audio is done really well. Highly recommend listening to it. I actually started reading the rest of the first book but realized I liked hearing the characters too much, so I listened to the rest of it even though it took longer to get through.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br />I do think they spent too much time searching for bandits. The details of the search were sort of interesting, but they could have covered that in one day and then glossed over the rest of it a bit more.<br /><br />I also think it was weird that Kvothe just decided to go off to another country for a few weeks (months?) when he had business to finish. I understand why, but I also think it could have been dealt with a little better.
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|I've had this movie in VHS format. I finally decided to buy it in DVD to enjoy it with my teenage daughter. We love this movie!
0756405890|5.0|This was a wonderful start to Kvothe's story. It hit on great points, brought in humor, adventure, great characters, and a great world.<br /><br />Note: I listened to the first book on audio and partway through it I knew I'd read it again and wanted that book and the rest, so I bought the actual books. However, the audio is done really well. Highly recommend listening to it.

B00FAX6XQC|5.0|lots of and challenging.  if u hunt or shoot. u will love it.  but upgrade with the region and not earlier.  great game
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|I like the game but an update is required to access the game I hit to update but there was no link, when will the link be available?
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I have played this on Facebook and I prefer the app version so far. Works well on my kindle fire hd in spite of comments in other reviews.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Great show! It keeps getting better and better and year 2 is better than year 1. Great chemistry among the characters!
B004TI5N38|4.0|For everyone saying it is a Jack Reacher clone I have an alternative theory, I think it is more of an homage to the Reacher series, the fact that the character's name is &#34;Puller&#34; and the other &#34;Reacher&#34; seems like too much of a coincidence. Imitation is the highest form of flattery and I found the story to be above average in this genre.<br /><br />On another note the production value of the audiobook is fantastic. It uses different actors for the male of female voices (sometimes I can't stand a man's voice doing the whole high pitched thing for the women character's in so many books) -- very well done and I cannot wait to read the follow up.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|You really get to know the characters and hope the ending of the LOVE story buried in this war has a happy ending. Quick read, hope they do a third movie too.
B001AW156U|5.0|Fits great on the controller and makes a HUGE difference in the quality of the games. Honestly, it is a must if you are into FPS games or fast paced Action adventure. Definitely recommend.
B009ZQNN90|4.0|Great story, nice to know it is rooted in a real situation. Fabulous acting by Chiwetel Ejiofor.  A lot of fun.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|Way better and much brighter than the incandescent lamp. It does not allow much focus though.  It is a broad beam source and close to white light.
B00FEAZGDC|5.0|Exquisite acting, wonderful, poignant resolution, hope for those of us who are aging and will have to cope with these sorts of losses.
B005721W9O|5.0|I really don't know where I was or what I was doing when this movie came out, but I know one thing I missed a great movie! Today I was looking for a little entertainment and thought this sounded like a good idea for a rainy Seattle afternoon. Wow was I really surprised when I found myself enjoying and really getting into the movie. I love science fiction, was fan of star trek, back in the day when they were first aired.<br /><br />Truly this is a great parody, I love the characters and I am going to watch it again and again and again. GREAT MOVIE<br /><br />Never Give Up!
B007ME5BUG|4.0|Has many details that I did not know about all of the theaters of the war from the beginning to the.  Also some interesting details as to the whys of the post war world.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Amazing. It really deserves all the rave reviews. It's got a narrative drive that feels as though both the writer and the reader are on speed together. The violence, empathy, moral complexity and range of the best of Dickens, reborn into the 21st century. A roller coaster ride.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|This has to be Gaga's best album to date! It even surpasses The Fame Monster, which i thought no album could surpass it! It's a beautiful work of art, combining the traditional Gaga-eske pop songs with catchy dance-y choruses and melodies, with some experimental tracks and genres like Rn'B and Rap/Hip-Hop, all engraved in the contemporary and classical worlds of art, referencing Jeff Koons and Botticelli with her album art cover… Lyrically and musically, her best work as of yet! It takes me to other dimensions when i listen to it, very out-of-this-world-y and very sentimental and real at the same time. It's also very personal to Gaga revealing some of her troubles and problems…<br />Overall, amazing!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Remarkably well done, well written, well acted, well everything.  This is one of the most intriguing series I have ever watched.  A total winner.
B004I744AS|5.0|I use it daily. Usually the first place I go with my morning coffee. I have a full homepage and often discover a new idea or consept. Like the daily articles and games.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I have been waiting for so long for this book I think I just might go into a great depression it's sad!!! :(
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This is really good, and a little different from everything else you read about vampires,and werewolves! Really loving this series.
1451695195|1.0|I wish I was naive enough to believe this nonsense and feel happy about my &#34;future.&#34; Do not waste your time.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This game is really fun and interesting although it can be boring just a bit , it's pretty good. It keeps entertained and doing something.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|excellent performance... Denzel was fantastic in this flick.<br />Very convincing of his role... gave 4 out of 5 stars. Excellent
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Great gaming CPU. Blazing fast. Also overclocks like a champ! Temps are pretty decent, usually idle at 28-30 C sitting at a stable 4Ghz on stock voltages under my Phanteks cooler. On Intel Burn Test, It will peak out around 65 C with X.M.P enabled for a 6 hour test on max stress.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is one of the best series I've ever read. Seriously. Wow. Amazing. Spectacular. Fantastic. Superb. Wonderful. Awesome. Great. Astronomical.
0517548232|5.0|If you're a beginner, and you want to get a basic idea of the unintended consequences of government policies, read this book.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|OK overlook capabilities, lacks in sorting capabilities overall a decent app good to monitor bids etc why do I have keep typing?
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game has tons of atmosphere. The graphics are amazing for a tablet game, and the sound helps create a very creepy atmosphere. You start off with what seems like a normal, straightforward locked box, but with each passing level, things get weirder and weirder. The only complaint I would have about it is that I wish it was longer because I didn't want it to end.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Awesome sequel and it very much held my interest so much that I couldn't put it down! Now, I'm onto the final book of this trilogy.
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|I've always been a big fan of Picross/Nonograms, and this game feels somewhat similar to me. The mechanics are completely different of course, but having to think so figure out what colors go where uses the same sort of skills and process of deduction.<br /><br />As you solve tiles, they disappear or turn transparent allowing you to see the background image.  The colors of the blocks roughly matches the color at that location in the background image, so areas of the picture that are blue will have blue blocks covering them.  Once you uncover some blocks in the area, you can generally use that to figure out some of the nearby tiles, but personally I prefer to work through the puzzle myself instead of using that 'cheat'.<br /><br />The only real complaint I would have would be that I tend to make a lot of mistakes, not because of deliberately guessing wrong but because I accidentally hit the wrong button. I mean to fill in a space with blue but hit red by mistake, for example. Fortunately, errors don't really count against you  -they get added up, but you won't lose the level if you make too many.  It still gets a bit annoying, though. I may just have fat fingers, though.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I usually have no problem downloading music videos. I love this app because it is easy to use on my Kindle Fire.
B00881VLCE|3.0|This is an extremely attractive puzzle game, and I wish I could give it 5 stars. The thing that's holding me back is that it crashes way too frequently. Its also often extremely slow when loading a puzzle. With some bug fixes and optimizations, I'd call this the best Jigsaw puzzle game available on tablets. Right now, though, I just can't give it as strong of a recommendation as I wish I could.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|Prior to buying this flash, I already have an SB-600 and 2 Yongnuo 560II flashes, I chose to buy the SB-700 because I prefer my on camera flash to be a Nikon.  Also, since my SB-600 flash has been in heavy use for the last few years, I figure I would have play less important role as a back up flash rather than the main on camera flash.  Given my experience with the SB-600, I will make review a comparison of the two flashes.<br /><br />Yes, this flash is a lot more expensive than a new SB-600 from a few years ago but I think for an extra hundred buck, it's worth the price.  First, the head rotate 180 degrees both ways which could be quite helpful in some situation.  The menu system is much more intuitive and I find that that the thump wheel in the back make it a bit easier to change power setting and I do like the Sb-700 screen better over all.  No question that the SB-600 work very well and it has been my work horse for years but the SB-700 was definitely and upgrade.<br /><br />If you want to get into off camera lighting, the SB-700 can be an excellent master and it does offer much more flexibility than just a pop up flash.  That said, I still prefer cheap radio triggers over the Nikon CLS system, but it is neat.  The last thing that I like about the SB-700 is that is has the thermal indicator so you have a clue as to how hard you are pushing flash and if you have to slow down, I definitely want to be in the loop as to how my gear in doing while I am shooting.<br /><br />The bottom line is the SB-700 is definitely worth the price and it's excellent flash, If I have my choice, I would get an SB-700 for my main on camera flash, and more of the cheaper SB-600 for off camera flash but Nikon doesn't make the SB-600 anymore. That and I think asking $200 for a used SB-600 is a ripped off, that's how much it cost new, spend the extra hundred and get a new SB-700 instead.
0393088804|5.0|This book is an intellectual investment that should be savored and valued as an heirloom to be passed on to future generations.<br /><br />The format is unique.  The art is stunning.  The scope is amazing.  And the lesson is timeless.  Combined with Adam Hochschild's essay on the significance of the Battle of the Somme (which was adapted from his incredible book, To End All Wars), Sacco's vision can be studied for hours.<br /><br />One of the most impressive works of history I have ever had the honor to experience.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Enjoyed this. The story continued in energy and was not as predictable as some. Looking forward to reading book 3.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|This is dramatically better than the calendar app that came with my Samsung Galaxy S4! In addition to my own calendar, I like to be able to see my wife's and kids' calendars. CalenGoo actually has options that make this useful. I can configure the widget to just display items for me and my younger daughter (whom I have to drive to her events). But that doesn't stop me from having the actual application show me everyone's calendars.<br /><br />The widget also is much more space-efficient and visually appealing than the stock Android one. Everything is incredibly configurable. I could see some people being a little overwhelmed at the number of options, some of which are not completely obvious. Fortunately, once you have it set up, it just works.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I'm not a movie snob.  I'm somewhat easily entertained.  I'm not the type who is going to tear a movie apart because of the central figure's past works (Superman, that is).  Nor will I figure it's so much better, just because it was created later and has much better graphics.  This movie was just an all around enjoyable movie.  I enjoyed the casting selections and thought the movie had a perfect pace to it.  It's one of the few movies I own that I can't wait to watch again.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|Found this group because of their single &#34;Sail&#34;.  Decided to gamble on the whole album. Glad I did.  I listen to the whole thing often.  Catchy tunes.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I've bought this only to wait to read it when I realised from the reviews that it's not the end of the story....  but it was an ok ending anyway - not quite a cliffhanger but not complete either (as the author writes)<br /><br />After a stellar, exciting and hot  2nd book, I did find this disappointing. For about half of the book, it sure felt that the same storylines kept repeating over and over. And how many times do we have to read about Gideon's physical perfection ... his body, his face, his anatomy, etc ... that you just say in your head &#34;ok, I get it! he's more than gorgeous, he's Adonis, the absolute perfect man!&#34; Except of course his head is a little screwed up with insecurities about Eva leaving him. A lot of gratuitous heat & sex that we didn't already get in the first 2 books. Don't get me wrong I like reading about heat & sex like any woman but even I had to say at some point that it too much of the same thing over and over.<br /><br />The story doesn't really kick until the 2nd half, I thought  and before you know it, it was ending. That said, I still love the characters of Eva and Gideon and I just wished that I could read more layers into their story and their relationship than what we got.<br />I didn't think it enhanced the 2 books as much and unfortunately, I will wait for the 4th and apparently, 5th books because surely it has to get better from here....
B008Y212PI|3.0|Pros:<br />- Nice multi-selection method makes solving puzzles faster.<br />- Solved puzzles reveal part of a scene, which makes game more engaging<br /><br />Cons<br />- Could use more of a variety of puzzle sizes - everything is a square, and solving puzzle after puzzle with same dimensions gets boring<br />- Solved grids don't always look much like the items they are supposed to be, which is not as satisfying.<br /><br />Overall: Not the best example of the genre, but decent game.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Great view of the changing world we live in.  It reinforces the choices I make every week when I buy meat.
B002UEW31I|5.0|I got out of the habit of watching tarintino movies for some years. I started watching again last year with his terrific slave movie. i decided to work backwards so next tried this.  it is just utterly fabulous.  it is about the Nazis at the end of WWII as the allies close in on them in france.  one unit with the name of the movie goes around killing any Nazis they can find and become very well known.  at the same time a young woman cinema owner plots to do away with all of the nazo high command at a movie premiere. everyone is great but let me single out christophe waltz as as SS commander who simulatenously tries to foil the allies as well as bargain with them.  he brings a wonderful humorous overlay to the whole movie. also, brad pitt is excellent with a texas drawl as an allied commander leading the Nazi murdering squad. all of his unit members are jewish. pitt is consistently underrated for his acting talent but i think he is one of the most versatile actors out there. as his looks become ever less important due to aging, perhaps others will finally notice his talent.  this is a must see film.  note:  this is a work of fiction. tarantino does do some things in his film which do not square with the history of that period.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00FXEL00W|4.0|A fun book to read. The two lead characters were lovable and easy to root for. It was nice that there were no truly evil characters. Everyone was basically a decent person. If you're looking to unwind this is a good read.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|This book is a great book.  I think that this will be a good idea to use it for your next book.<br />I love this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
B008VO3PA4|5.0|Loved it so so much I could die! Fun poem book with some adult humor included. But just an all around funny book.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This is a great watch for my collection. The fit and feel is just right. The only warning for buyers is that the wrist bands are way smaller than they look in the pictures. Its a great watch and does not run on battery, but it gets going very fast after moving it around  for a bit. Other than the size of the bands I am all for this watch.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A great way to kill a couple of hours.  It's not a long game, but the graphics certainly make it worth it.  It's not a brain killer, but it's not mindless either.  Looking forward to the second one!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Good finish for the three part series. While the second book was sub-par the third installment of Veronica Roth's Divergent series was a solid story and worth the purchase. Several key relationships are resolved and the mystery of what lies beyond the city is also cleared up. While overall the series was just average, this third book was a fitting conclusion.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I love this app so much and after I watched the movie I had to get I never put it down even when on the toilet yea it's that good
0740748475|5.0|Calvin and Hobbes is wonderful and imaginative and people of all ages can relate to it.<br />The books themselves are of good quality and are worth the investment.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I absolutely could not lay this book down. I was so filled with pride for our service men &women fighting for our freedoms while reading this that I was on the verge of tears all the way through. Thank you is not even sufficient.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|Phenomenal series.  The cast is amazing.  Peter O'Toole was totally unexpected as the pope.  What a great discovery!  I can't believe I missed this show when it originally aired.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie !!! Great action packed zombie movie. The zombies are super fast so that kinda makes you jump. I have seen every zombie movie there is to see, and I rate this movie an 8 1/2. I love the way they chatter their teeth,That was freaky!!!!!
0670020745|4.0|This is a very interesting book.  I found it helpful after having my own brain hemorrhages.  The more technical chapters can be a bit boring, but if you keep reading, it is worth it. Based on my own experience after having two brain hemorrhages, I don't agree with all her information concerning the differences between the right and left side of the brain, but I found the book helpful overall.  It gives a lot of hope for long term healing following a hemorrhage.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it has a lot of fun games on it and it gives you points even if you don't reach your target score. You unlock new games (within the game) with points you accumulate by playing. It's a fun way to pass a little time.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|This wasn't what I was expecting at all as the final chapter in the story.  I think that what really hindered the storytelling was taking the characters outside the world that Roth had so carefully constructed in the first two books.  The characters had a hard time making sense of their new surroundings, and that bled over to the audience.  Motivations and feelings get blurry and muddled once they leave the walls of the city.  Pulling the curtain back on the world and introducing new villains and victims is a lot to do in the last book in a trilogy.  I would say that it is a must read for fans of the series only because the last book ends on such a cliffhanger, but I don't think this is the closure many fans are expecting.  And it certainly isn't the story they deserve.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|In this story, you will laugh and she'd some tears as well, being an educator for 10 years has taught me about the way children deal with each other, bullying and unexpected acts of kindness! Just like August and Jack struggle, hundreds of kids suffer discrimination at school, playgrounds and many other places. It is important for us to teach and constantly model kindness to all our children, then we will stop the terrible bullying that takes away the joy of school from our children. Choose kindness!
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|Hard to put down...the ending was not what I wanted as I wanted the book to continue on and on.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Loved this book! I'd recommend it to anyone! All teenagers should read this book as well, as it gives such an important insight into all of our personal & national histories. Well done!
B000068FXX|5.0|As with all Supertramp albums, Even in the Quietest Moments is unique, yet distinctively Supertramp.  This one came just a few years before Breakfast in America (an absolute classic that must be counted in the very top echelons of popular music), but seems to come from a very different time and place.  A wonderful place nevertheless.<br />Each and every song is unique, from the ever popular and vibrant Give a Little Bit, to the wonderful opus of Fools Overture.  However, what I think is one of the more neglected songs on the album, Downstream, is one of the most beautiful love songs you are likely to hear.  Just Rick and his piano.  So simple, yet hauntingly romantic; think of someone you really love, play it without inhibition and it might well bring tears to you eyes.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|Very funny.  Surprising twists in the plot and great animation.  And who doesn't enjoy listening to Antonio Banderas!  Great entertainment.
B00G4CXHSK|4.0|It's a fun sidescroller with lots of upgrades, what's not to like. Other than the fact that there aren't many levels.
B003UESJF6|5.0|FUNNY!  Better than I expected.  I'll watch this one again in another couple months and again a couple months after that!
B00CKOZ8QA|5.0|I was  on my way to work when on WCLK (Atlanta) I heard this unfamiliar yet wonderfully familiar soul-soothing voice creating beautiful visual poetry.  It was Gregory Porter performing Painted on Canvas.  Oftentimes I don't get the name of an artist or the title of a tune but this time, I waited patiently, pen and paper ready and got both, and I made a quick note:  BUY!!!  I wanted this piece of work to be in my collection and I knew there was more to get so this morning I spent a couple of hours on YouTube listening to every Gregory Porter tune available.  With each tune he and the gifted artists who support his vocals tell a familiar and enchanting story of love and life.  I am planning to purchase all three of Gregory Porter's CDs to introduce him to family and friends at an upcoming event.  What a gift!
B001XV3LSS|4.0|An interesting story of a talented young woman with literal stars in her eyes.  I have flown an airplane over the array of dishes in New Mexico where some of it is filmed.  Barton Carter.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Loved it. I don't like horror but the title caught my eye and it had such high ratings. I ended up watching the whole season over two days. I just HAD to see the next show.... lol
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Love the game play. Especially like the way the solutions flow from your unconscious when you are most relaxed. I highly recommend the game.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Just now on level five, waiting for it to pick up, not digging the inability to move items placed, but may move faster the higher level I get
B00BBA6FMU|5.0|Excellent excellent! Best read in a very long time<br /> It sticks with you as do the characters. 5 stars is well deserved
B008MM9630|4.0|Very good game, graphics, it has frozen a few times in the past buy it reloads where you left off...no crashes since!!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like this game very much for you have to be quick in order to win and go up the ladder. I just am annoyed that I am stuck on level thirteen and its always the same candy order, so I feel like I'll be on that level forever. Also, you have to wait so long in order for you to have lives again. Very frustrating. But all in all, it's a really cool game.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Read this book as part part of a book club. As an oncology nurse  I was hesitant to read this as just another cancer , I could not have been more wrong. Amazing book.
B00FAPU0UK|5.0|Pamela loved her games and she was in control!  This story was very intense and vivid.  Each and every time, I thought she was a goner.  Nice job to the both of you.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Without reading the series you may miss many of the nuances. The movie moved a little slow at times. I was surprised that the movie was as good as it was however.
B00CR1DX9A|5.0|This book was quite a change from the last book I read by this author.  I was laughing all the way throughout this one!  Steve and the hamburger buns was my all time favorite part!  Thanks for brightening up my day! But my favorite character was Maggie and all of her doodling.
B009MYARIK|5.0|No matter which Sophie Kinsella book I pick up, I can't put them down! Whenever I'm in a bad mood these books always take me to another place. Can't wait to read the next one.
B00BSZZA3I|2.0|Most inconvienient and not durable at all! Hard to take pictures with the case on unless you have an extra hand to hold the cover out of the way. The plastic has already cracked a big corner chunk off on mine which leaves me with zero protection until I order a whole new phone case (from a different manufacturer). I have only had it a couple of months! The flexibility to become a stand for the phone does come in handy but it's not worth the lack of quality required to have that option (at least not in this particular design).
B00C7607BC|5.0|Great movie!  I loved this movie as a little girl and now I get to share it with my girls.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Wonderful, as of 2/17/2016 paid version incompatible with kindle 10. fault of device.  SIMPLE TO USE, FREE, & ACTUALLY USEFUL. I  have a FIRE HD (previous generation). There is no noticeable drain as some one star reviews mention. You can call up a graphic showing charge and drain hour by hour. It gives a report on battery health including charge voltage and temperature.  I am sceptical that this app is responsible for start up issues. The FIRE is a electronic device... sometimes needing reboot. Remember the basics when encountering issues
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What a way to end this riveting series. I will be rereading this in the future and encouraging my friends and family to do the same.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Love this romantic show. Would recommend this to any women. The men in this show is sexy and you never know what is going to happen in each episode.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I wish I could go back and un-read the ending.. it ruined the entire series for me.  I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who prefers happy endings, it'll only end in frustration.
B001KZG99A|4.0|The one that launched the Marvel movies juggernaut.  This movie is excellently written and produced.  It is in my top 10 favorites list.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game! I can play bingo without spending money! That is always a bonus. I liked getting bingos and extra credits and points.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|I went into this movie with low expectations because of the reviews.  I was pleasantly surprised by how good of a movie it was.  If you're on the fence, give it a try, it is well worth the watch.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|What makes certain people extraordinarily successful? Is it luck? Are they just born with it? No, Gladwell describes the phenomenon of perfect timing and those seemingly small events of chance that lead certain individuals down the path of fortuitous opportunity.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This app is the best. The result come out Crystal clear and it is compatible to instagram Twitter Facebook. I love it. Don't listen to others get the app.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing this game. I need an intervention. I am glued to it. Each level is a new challenge.
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|The best weather on the Kindle that I found yet and it has been compared to a quite a few by myself since I got this kindle
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think it is awesome because it is very cooperative and it will let you do things fast.  that is why it is very AWESOME!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a very addictive game. You can't stop playing. I really enjoy playing with friends on Facebook. I love it!
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|I thought this was a funy game...my mom has the ring tone for it too<br />The only thing i dont like is the plane game cause i cant play it  but i do recomend it
6305428042|5.0|Seriously my favorite movie of all time, I used to watch this as a kid on the Disney channel. I got this for me and my daughter to watch this past Halloween and she loved it!
B00BEF1AEK|4.0|Well......it was free when I downloaded it. That's about all I can say for it. It really IS an odd little game and good for a few laughs at the odd face King Oddball makes. I can't really figure out the point, but a lot of people seem to like it, so make your decision based on all the other reviews. But I'm glad I didn't pay even .99 for it.<br /><br />February 2014 -- bumped this up another star because I've become \\"oddly\\" hooked on it after watching my five year old grandson enthralled with it. I gave it another go and that goofy king is addicting. Also did you know you can \\"talk\\" to him on a little red phone? If you uncover one of his secrets, you get to another screen.<br /><br />Still not sure what the point of this game is!
B000FCKIFU|2.0|Pretty mechanical writing, churned out according to some template,it seems. But worst of all are the technical errors. The ATM heist right at the beginning is a farce. Did nobody check this before publishing?
B00BZW5W3W|5.0|Great mature Music, great background music, This woman can squal, Quiet Fire and Pouring Rain are grammy worthy.I can gaurantee that if you play this cd around guest they will ask who is that in amazement.This woman has a unique voice like Anita Backer had in the late 80`s. Maysa can scatt also.You cant go wrong in purchasing this and past cd`s
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Ugh! I don't like the ending at all! Wtf! After all she went through? And it ended  just like that? :\
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|I like the quality of this video.  The plot itself is just lots of action with not too much of the meaning.  The theme song is great with Adele's beautiful and powerful voice.  Overall, it is a good movie with lots of action if that is what you are looking after.  it is a good movie to kill the time.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Hello today, now this is a very fun app to have I can download my videos, and my songs so easy it's just a great app to have! the Divinefairy,
1439152799|5.0|Kate Morton is one of my favorite writers.  I lingered on every phrase, every sentence and delighted in her clever Mud Man premise to a satisfying ending.  The three sisters captured my imagination, as did the backstory of the war in England.  While this is not a historical novel, the history is rich and fiction enticing.<br />I can still feel the tension in the relationship between the heroine and her mother, so aptly described and beautifully rendered. Kate has a way of bringing you into the settings to where you feel you have been transported from your reading chair to where the characters live and breathe.  Time passes and you can hear a pin drop.  Descriptive writing and prose at its best.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I really liked this movie.  I think there was some issues with the way it was released and some extras but I honestly don't sit there and watch all the commentary.  If I missed an extra I probably wouldn't have noticed anyway.  The movie is visually great and the acting is well done.  There is an excess of lens flares and JJ Abrams has actually apologized for this.  He just loves them I guess.  I thought the movie had a ton of action and suspense and was overall a really good movie.  Nothing great, like it will change your life or something, but it is worth the couple of hours.
030758836X|4.0|I ripped through this book, gasping at the premise and could not put it down until the last few chapters and then was so upset with the ending.  I wanted it to be different, somehow justified to a conclusion that seemed like something normal people would do.  However, neither the husband nor the wife are remotely normal.<br />Her twisted, dark characters are frightening and make your skin crawl because they behave in ways that shock you to the core. Gillian's an accomplished writer and book groups will love to argue about the ending.
B0083Z614S|4.0|Read it without hesitation. You will be captivated and transported into a magic yet very human world. Great both for adults and for kids.
0385344228|5.0|One of the best murder mystery stories I have ever read.  What would you do to protect your child?<br />Any parent who reads this book will never look at their child the same way when he or she spends a lot of quiet time in their room on the internet.  Could you defend your own child?  Would you automatically believe in his or her own guilt or innocence?  William Landy poses a shattering view of a father having to defend his own child accused of murder, while trying to hold a marriage together with threads of painful family secrets too frightening as a father to face.  The ending will rattle you to the core.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|Every time there is an update kindle users have to uninstall then reinstall the game!!!So far I've been lucky I keeping all my farm info.But its real pain!!! Please fix!!!
B00F7YHDWC|2.0|I think that it should be less violent because little kids play on these devices .we want our kids to learn instead of finding out dumb ways to die.
B00EOGZ42U|4.0|I adored this game until I reached levels where you can't win without using some of the special functions (laser flowers, for example if you're familiar with the game).  I just did not find the instructions (and some of the other game controls) intuitive.  I flubbed thru a number of levels while ignoring the functions I didn't understand, but eventually they become necessary.  Despite going back a number of times to the levels where they first appear and the instructions are given, I just couldn't wrap my head around getting them to work.  I also found that the constant pinching &amp; zooming had me accidentally launching or misdirecting groups of seeds on a fairly regular basis.  These were problems only in the later levels and I loved the game until then.  The game is very elegant in design, and maybe its just me, but I think a little less style and a little more clarity of various control &amp; functions would be helpful.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This app is awesome the app is just like the movie and has a lot of robots to choose from and the graphics r amazing and the fighting Is so cool if u like real steel then this app is for u!
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|A modern day 1984. Thought-provoking and frightening. Couldn't put it down. I highly recommend it!<br /><br />Not enough words to post review.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved it. It completes the series nicely. I can't wait for the movie. It will be Epic! I'm so excited!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game!!!!! very addicting and keeps me entertained!  play it all the time, love it!!!!! I recommend it to all!
B00GHJ6BJW|4.0|First, some background about what I believe pop to be.<br />To me, pop should be nothing more than mindless, blonde (please don't be offended, you know what I mean), summer bubblegum fun full of catchy, memorable tunes with the sole purpose of making you happy and leaving you completely absent-minded, while you enjoy the repetitive beat. The Fame Monster had that essence, which is why I loved it and became a fan of Lady Gaga. Born This Way, to me, was too preachy in its message. I understand how bad that sounds, especially in today's politically-correct era, but, again, you know what I want from a pop album.<br /><br />Here's what I liked about Born This Way: Lady Gaga's singing. Anybody who hadn't caught on to Lady Gaga's singing ability should have realized that she is a very talented singer.<br /><br />Here's what I didn't like about Born This Way: The sound, to me, was too heavy. It was heavily electronic, filled with a bunch of indifferentiable sounds that were too clumped together and uninspired. And, again, she wanted a message, which is fine, but I didn't like it.<br /><br />Now, on the subject of Artpop. It has the sound of Born This Way with the subject matter and mindlessness of The Fame Monster. I wouldn't put it above The Fame Monster because the sound isn't as clean, but I like it better than Born This Way because of the lack of substance. Another thing about this album is that it grew on me. Upon my first listen through it, I wasn't sure what to think, which isn't a good sign. I gave it another listen and I started to appreciate the songs some more, until I eventually started liking them.<br /><br />Give it a chance, especially since it's only six dollars, and enjoy.
B005M2A4DE|5.0|Unfortunately for me, the first couple of seasons I was without cable and missed out on first-run episodes. Then one Christmas, I caught Christmas Carol and then a BBC Doctor Who Year marathon of the previous season. I was hooked. Months later, I gave in to cable and soon thanks to BBCA and Scyfy, my DVR was chock full of episodes. I binged. I binged hard. From season 1 thru 4, catching up on everything. Then, from time to time, I'd catch ridiculous deals on dvd's/blu ray seasons. Once again, I've ditched the cable and my Who collection had only been missing Season 6. Until now! Twenty five bucks for S6 blu ray. Saturday nights won't be the same without Matt Smith, but thanks to Amazon, I can watch him and the past Doctors anytime.
B00D7NWTSI|2.0|This is supposed to be a big-budget 3D science fiction movie. I just watched the movie &#34;step up - revolution&#34; in 3D, which is a pop dance movie, with virtually no special effects, other than high frame rate stuff. &#34;Step up&#34; looks 10x better, in 3D, compared to this new Iron Man movie. Very depressing. Obviously, Hollywood still does not understand who knows how to film great 3D movies.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|I bought this book after Mark Cuban came to my university. Indiana University-Bloomington. Which is also where he graduate from. I love this book its a short read but has great info and knowledge
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|At this point - you're either a Gaga fan or not.  Fans won't be disappointed. Just like Born This Way had less mass-appeal than The Fame Monster, this one is probably even less radio-friendly than that.  But it's wonderful.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Oh Christian what am I going to do with you? &#34;baby, it's our party, and we can do whatever we want. We've cut the cake. And right now, I'd like to whisk you away and have you all to myself.&#34; He's so good in bad situations, &#34;it's the adrenaline, baby,&#34; he says. &#34;You did amazingly well, as usual. You blow me away, Ana. You never let me down.&#34; And Ana that girl still teases him, &#34;well, right now I want to eff you, and you're shifting around on me...it's uncomfortable.&#34; And he's still a possessive control freak, &#34;do you think I'd let anyone watch my wife some?&#34; I loved this book Christian is REALLY playful and more at ease and relaxed in this installment, &#34;hurry up with my food, wench. And later I'll show you how wimpy I can be.&#34; He slaps me playfully once more and goes to the fridge.&#34;
0385350864|3.0|I'll admit it, I never read the two previous Bridget Jones books, but DID see the movies, and enjoyed them both a lot. That said, I also didn't &#34;read&#34; this book, instead I listened to the audiobook (read expertly by Samantha Fox) - this is probably why I don't have some of the complaints that other readers have when they say the book reads like a giant Twitter feed. By now, everyone knows of the big twist - Mark's dead. Many people have a problem with this, but I think I get it. Bridget Jones is the quintessential single woman - and reading about her settled down just doesn't allow for the same amount of blundering and folly. We've only ever seen Bridget when she's making a mess of life, but married to Mark - that same Bridget wouldn't be very interesting. Happy = Boring. So, I accept Fielding's choice to kill off Mark. It also made me look at Bridget with a bit more compassion than I have in the past. Being a widow can be sad, but Bridget makes it fun and funny. That's why we love her.<br /><br />SPOILERS TO FOLLOW -<br /><br />Things I liked:<br />1. I enjoyed Bridget's relationship with her children - it felt real.<br />2. I enjoyed Bridget's struggle to be a good mother, dress in current fashion, and jump back into dating.<br />3. I actually really liked Roxster - Bridget's Toy Boy - their relationship was fun to read about and he seemed like a great guy.<br /><br />Things I hated:<br />1. Bridget's obsession with Twitter. It felt like Helen Fielding had NO knowledge of how Twitter works - you don't just get on Twitter and then suddenly get hundreds of followers - unless you're famous or followed by a ton of spambots. Her constant tweeting was weird. And seriously, she MET a man on Twitter WITHOUT a photo?!?! I call BS. And the fact that she feared Facebook was totally unrealistic! EVERYONE's on Facebook!<br />2. The way Bridget lost her weight - she goes to an obesity clinic and has to eat their regimented food to do it. Then, later in the book, she's still down about forty pounds, eats a ton of different food, and barely gains back any of the weight - totally unrealistic!<br />3. The unresolved career in screenplay writing. Why couldn't she be successful with writing? Or least start a blog that took off and got tons of followers? It could have been called &#34;Bridget Jones' Diary&#34; and ended that storyline sweetly. Instead, they just kind of dropped that storyline and made Bridget's success in life due to her marriage, rather then allow her to find success on her own terms.<br /><br />Fielding seems to have only one model of romance she can write about - and Bridget's relationship with Mr. Wollicker is pretty much EXACTLY the one she had with Mark Darcy.<br /><br />Let me break it down:<br />1. She starts of thinking he hates her and that she hates him.<br />2. She gradually realizes that there's more to him then she thought.<br />3. She makes a complete ass of herself in front of him.<br />4. It becomes apparent that he likes her, but when she realizes that she actually likes him there are giant obstacles standing in the way of them being together (like another woman, or him believing she's still with her &#34;Toy Boy&#34;).<br />5. A big issue comes up (in this case a dick who drives his BMW onto the school playground) where he has to save her (or in this case, her son).<br />6.Then, a perfect situation occurs that unites the two, and it turns out that he likes her, &#34;just the way she is&#34; - and the two live happily ever after. The end.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed listening to this book. I enjoyed Bridget. And I enjoy the world Fielding has created (even if I do have criticisms).
B000KIPT30|2.0|Im not much of a fan of Behringer to begin with but I LOVE and use the X32 mixer. I use these 4 channel and 2 channel mixers for my in ears for my musicians that dont need to move around. the reason I gave them 2 stars is because they have a LOT of floor noise and you have to crank the volume about 90% to get much sound from it. I have 6 of these guys and they are all the same.<br />the only ones of good use to me are the 2 channel mixers because I can use the mic input instead of the monitor input. this gives me more headroom due to the mic pre inside, but then the signal gets really distorted... my musicians just deal with it.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|I watched this back to back for the entire 13 episodes. It is really a great series and you get drawn into the plot. One thing I learned after the fact is that this series is a copycat version of the British version. I started watching it to see if there was some commonality and was a little disappointed to see all of the same issues and almost lines. So this is not as original as you might think, but it had to be adapted to represent the US government from the original Great Britain version. I have only watched the first BCC version so it might not hold true for the entire series.<br /><br />I can say that the US version has far greater production values so you will enjoy it more than the BCC version.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Wow.  If this book doesn't change your life for the better I would be very surprised.  Everything Pam said made perfect sense. Brilliant.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I had the ultimate pleasure of seeing the new lineup with Todd La Torre two days ago and was pleasantly surprised at the amazing energy and the renewal the band has. It is a refreshing change and I admit I was skeptical but so glad I bought tickets and went. Todd took us through some old and some new and I was equally impressed with how he sang both the old songs and belted out the new stuff as well. You can just feel the good energy with these guys and Todd is very humble, professional and makes you feel the up close and personal energy between them and the audience. They blew the roof off the casino. You could tell the crowd was all skeptical at first but by the second or third song, they let their guard down and melted into what was happening. Change can be a good thing and Queensryche is going strong for sure with Todd up front.
B0071MDA2U|4.0|Amazingly great book!! Well written and a plot that keeps you going. Oliver has a way of twisting tangling and then surprising a reader.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Got it for the Kindle Fire and after using it a few minutes, the Kindle crashed and I had a hard time getting it back on.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy that Candy Crush Saga made its way to my Kindle. Love the game, is very addictive! When I have difficulty gettting through certain levels it makes me want to try even harder to achieve the level.  Good game!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It is the best hunting game in the world.My FAVORITE!!! I have tried several other games and this one beats them all
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|Fantastic movie, but you MUST watch it all in one sitting! And then you'll probably want to watch it two or three more times. The closer you look....
B00EDF43MY|3.0|I was excited when they introduced a bunch of Dr. Panda games recently but in their rush to put out new apps, they seem to have made an exception for quality. This game lacks the variety of earlier Dr. Panda Games.<br /><br />I will say that the mini-games where the passenger navigates the rope-maze and landing the planes are both fun but the other games are pretty poor.<br /><br />I think it would be a neat game to play with your small child prior to taking their first plane trip or to kill time at the airport, otherwise I would put this one towards the bottom of Dr. Panda apps (maybe only above the very poor &#34;Auto Garage&#34; game).
B00F52YOPA|4.0|You can find the hidden objects even though you have decorated the room everyway you can.  Wish there was another room or more options!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Game can be frustrating but once you solve the puzzle...you think why did it take me so long to solve that. I hate that you have to earn coins for hints but I guess everyone needs to make a buck.
B00FPH6M82|2.0|This film would probably work well as a book, or perhaps a graphic novel....or a lunchbox...or a meatloaf. Essentially, it would work better as anything apart from the film it ended up being. The characters had an interesting sort of hybrid accent conglomerating elements from around the world, giving the distant future a cool polyglot effect, and Will Smith did well as a militaristic, absentee father, with Jaden playing the part of a forsaken son trying to prove himself to his father nearly without flaw. However, the story could have been told in its entirety within about 5 minutes, with very little dialogue, and much of that dialogue awkward and phoned in, in terms of writing. The second star I gave it was for the visuals. Much of the aesthetic is downright breathtaking, or at least would be were it not unabashed, ten-yards-behind-cutting-edge CGI. All told, this film is summed up ideally by the trailer: computer-generated monsters (totaling 5 species, 4 of which are shown therein) and Will and Jaden Smith playing themselves on a lean weekend.
B00A2H9PLG|3.0|The movie was pretty good, but Olympus Has Fallen was way better to my thinking.  The action was really good with all of the explosives.
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|This doll is exceptional and intriguing.  She has her own appeal and is completely different from all the Monster High dolls.
B00ESGYQWA|5.0|Such a lovely adaptation with an equally lovely cast and well talented Director! I've been fan of Whedon's since the days of 'Buffy' so naturally I was curious how this would turn out and I was not disappointed in the least! Adored every interaction & how each emotion was perfectly displayed. The soundtrack was amazing as well & have downloaded it as well.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I thought that this was to be the book that tied everything together.  Seemed like there was acute brain lock instead.  There was a lot left dangling and all of the segments that seem to just run out of story.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Best in app purchasing game!<br /><br />Luv luv luv luv luv it!  Yay! Gimme more. Please! Buy now!<br />Just like the original content of this year and never been trying to get the original.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Girlfriend got me to watch this recently and I love this show now!!! Wish I had found it earlier but glad I was introduced to it!
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|Please fix the update..it says update now then I click update now and it takes you to the app store but there is no update ..won't allow me to play without running the update..very disappointed.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This one was even better than the first! I LOVE the way the writer sets up the ending of this book for the next one! I loved what happened at the end with Christian and Ana! It made me Soooo much happier than the ending of the first book! Can't wait to read the last one.. Kinda sad that I have only one book left to read though!
0783230079|5.0|A great movie with great talent. Robert Downey Jr is amazing as always.  Funny, sad all in one great soundtrack.
B008VSKPJO|5.0|Not the music I play when I have the homies over, but I love it for hanging out around the house or doing housework. Old time feel and great voice! Heard her music the first time when I was at the bar and someone put her on the jukebox. I took her name and looked her up on Amazon. I fully enjoy this album along with one Amazon recommended called Devil Doll (although Amazon's samples of both Imelda May and Devil Doll do not do either artist justice, esp Devil Doll). I now listen to her uplifting sound around the house in my downtime when Im in the mood for swing or old-time sounding music. Happy to have this in my collection!
006202406X|1.0|This was an author who showed such promise. Alas, it was not to be. What a waste of time and energy for the readers! Try a different series, one that doesn't leave you feeling suicidal and depressed. You can get that from the news anytime.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Definitely love the game, would recommend to all my friends and family!!! It is nice I would like more interaction with the characters moving to wherever I want them to go.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|I loved this movie. Eep is a great character who wants more out of life and her father is a wonderful person who wants his family to be safe. I would recommend this movies to anyone and everyone.
B003H4I4JU|1.0|Enders Game was an excellent story. This one was boring. Never got interested in the characters. The &#34;piggies&#34; are stupid. Quit reading half way through. Enjoying some Frank Herbert right now.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Best app ever. My kids could play for hours. It has many many features, the growing hair is a bonus. Very well made, awesome graphics.
B007ZUSTEM|5.0|Have heard of the 5 Love Languages for years, picked up this copy a month ago and love that it is so practical!  Dr. Chapman was a Singles pastor for many years and really understands the dynamic of love lived out in ALL relationships!  Am working my way through with the tips on growing in each of the love languages and already seeing great results with my family and friends.<br />So appreciate that bright idea that even old relationships that have seemed to reach of place of malaise can be restarted by learning to love in a way that fits that person the best....amazing!!  Chapters on adult siblings, coworkers, and friends expanded my view of the use of &#34;love languages&#34; way beyond just marriage.  I am buying copies for each of my adult children BEFORE they get engaged....so they will be living it out in lots of way.  I have been married 33 yrs and have 5 newly grown children, aging parents, distant siblings, dozens of dear friends and ministry in various places/spaces.  This book is a TOOL like no other, after the living Word of God :)  Buy a copy....read it, try it...you won't be disappointed!

B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Played it before, it is a little better now than it was before. I'll keep playing. It keeps me occupied. Although, if it wasn't free I wouldn't pay money for it
141694737X|5.0|What's not to love in a book that is celebrating its 30th anniversary. There is a good reason for its longevity. This book is perfect for a 1-year old. My grandson loves what he finds under each flap and I love that he is learning new descriptive words.
B009C7ZQM4|3.0|I've loved this app for a while I wish it could pinpoint more things and help me to see if an app was dangerous or not and alert me whether app was open or not but I like it for now

B0064MPXFA|4.0|If you are looking for a feel good program where the bad guys always lose ( almost) and the good guys always win, this is it. We watch this after a session of &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; so we can sleep at night.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|I like it a lot. Its easy to use and gives pretty good results. The best feature is the ability to reel the negatives thru the machine rather than cutting the film and trying to put into the trays.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We cannot wait for the next season. There is nothing more intriguing that a family of very bright people with English accents living in an English manor where the events in the mansion's basement can have as much impact on their lives and our emotions as the specific world war unfolding just outside the mansion gates.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Best music DVD ever! Period! Led Zeppelin was and is the greatest rock band to ever grace the stage and studio. As a child born in the '60's, I knew they were good, but had no idea just HOW good. Now though, in my 50's, I have found a new appreciation for their work and simply can't get enough! Consider myself blessed to have been born in the era that produced solid, unforgettable Rock Gods. Tell my kids all the time that music made after the 70's just doesn't count as rock! Rock on Led Zeppelin.....thanks for the show!
B006YG9HJE|2.0|Another full year of Nikita and Percy playing cat and mouse. The ongoing chase becomes boring and predictable. If these folks are so highly trained and skilled how is it they cannot finish a job? This becomes laughable and greatly annoying.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|This is my favorite album of all time; the songs flow together so well. Thom Yorke is amazing, along with the songs he writes.
0060763280|5.0|great insights. especially interesting to see how the general public views and treats the rich (negatively) whilst wishing to attain the same financial heights.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|ok once I downloaded this on my kindle fire and once I hit start it said &quot;not enough storage space&quot; and I just deleted like 10 games what the heck this takes up way to much storage space other than that its really fun though

B008ER9QKG|5.0|What I love about Robert Lepage's production of Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen is that it demonstrates how modern stagings of the work can be creative, exciting, and wholly new while still respecting and being faithful to Wagner's vision. I've seen reviews from critics who have disparaged this particular production for not offering a unique interpretation, and I find this idea that operatic masterpieces need to be re-imagined by stage directors to be misguided. To receive the full impact of Wagner's total works of art, to be overwhelmed and transported by them, there needs to be a cohesive bond between the music, the words, and the staging. Even in the best of the productions that attempt to update or adapt the work, like [[ASIN:B0009F2EPU Wagner: The Ring of the Nibelung ( Das Rheingold / Die Walküre / Siegfried / Götterdämmerung) (Boulez/Chereau Ring Cycle)]], there is a rift between what you're hearing and what you're seeing, a disconnect between what the director is presenting and what Wagner is communicating if you will, that makes complete artistic harmony impossible. Besides, in presenting one interpretation like Chéreau does, all the other subtexts and ideas in the operas that can only be fully realized in a mythological setting true to Wagner's text are given short shrift.<br /><br />The Lepage production on the other hand is a sumptuous visual feast, full of imagination, truly allowing the viewer to surrender to the power of Wagner's drama. As other reviewers have pointed out, the costumes and settings are definitely in the traditional mold, but they have been given new life through an ingenious use of modern technology. Almost every scene in the opera is enhanced through the configurations and backdrops of the \\"machine\\", Lepage's 45-ton invention of spinning and rotating planks. This production is full of absolutely stunning sequences that will forever be burned into your memory after seeing them: Wotan and Loge's descent into Nibelheim, theascent of the gods to Valhalla on the rainbow bridge, Siegmund running through the snow covered trees with his pursuers behind, the Valkyries riding on the planks, the reflections of Siegfried and Mime in the stream, the wood bird singing to Siegfried, the Wanderer rising up for his final evocation of Erda, Siegfried's Rhine journey and so, so much more. Then there are the little details, like bubbles rising out of the mouths of the Rhinemaidens as they sing, or leaves rustling around the feet of Siegfried as he walks that just add to the experience. The only scenes that I don't think are brought to their full potential through use of the machine are in scenes 2 and 4 of Das Rheingold. Here we are given a static, dull, grey mist-like background. While that may have worked for the action after Freia is kidnapped by the giants, I think there is a lot more that could have been done. A blue sky with clouds floating by and Valhalla projected above? Rolling hillsides or mountain peaks? The possibilities are endless. And that's the great thing about this particular production as we move into the future: it can be constantly updated, tweaked, and re-thought simply through creating new digital projections and configurations for the machine.<br /><br />I know some critics have taken issue with some particular effects like the gods entering in Das Rheingold by sliding down the machine, or the disappointing dragon in Siegfried, or the \\"exploding\\" heads of the statues of the gods at the end Götterdämmerung. I personally think that on the whole these reviews are being a tad bit cynical. I don't find the sliding entrances to be all that distracting to be honest. The dragon in Siegfried, while not exactly ferocious, is at least recognizable as such and a vast improvement over the dragon in [[ASIN:B00006L9ZT Wagner: Der Ring des Nibelungen - Complete Ring Cycle (Levine, Metropolitan Opera)]]. And as for the heads of the statues exploding at the end of the cycle, I perceived it asmore of a crumbling than an explosion. Of course I didn't witness it live and maybe it didn't fully come across on video. But like I mentioned earlier, in either case its something that can be tweaked. I think the overall idea of the statues of the gods falling apart to represent Valhalla burning is a good one.<br /><br />The quality of the music and acting here is very high. The sound is wonderful. The orchestra is in top form. As far as the acting went, I was particularly impressed with Gerhard Siegel's portrayal of Mime and his touches of slapstick in Das Rheingold, the youthful and exciting Siegfried of Jay Hunter Morris, and Stephanie Blythe's proud and domineering Fricka, just to name a few. Eric Owens sounded great as Alberich, and I was pleasantly surprised by Deborah Voigt's singing and subtle acting touches as Brünnhilde. She proved herself to be a consummate professional. Jay Hunter Morris' sound may have been a little thin for my liking in the forging song, but his singing got better as he progressed and his acting performance saw him through. Truthfully, no one is any less than good and there are no major blemishes with any of the cast members.<br /><br />After seeing this production, it is now my favorite Ring cycle on dvd by far, and definitely the best introduction to the work available for the newcomer. Sit back, submerge yourself in the gorgeous images and wonderful music and let it transform you.
B00F35BV64|5.0|This was a fun, action packed, and exciting movie. I really enjoyed it. I love the star trek series very much.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The best book I've read in a LONG time.  Reminded me of Defending Jacob which is a big compliment. One single act can change the course of so many lives.  I actually muted The Big Bang Theory to read this one!
B005TBN3EU|5.0|This was so funny. I have seen every single one, but I could watch every single one multiple of times.
B005CA4SQK|4.0|The Walking Dead is one of the better television shows on the air. It has won numerous awards and accolades. The first season combines good acting with decent writing. It deviates quite a bit from the comic book, and in my opinion, for the worse. The bluray edition is well made and has some great special features. Any fan of the show will love this edition.
B008EKMB82|1.0|I liked the story of Nao and would have continued reading but Ruth and Oliver both boring and Ruth and characters on their island are cliché. Author manages to fit in the obligatory condemnation of George Bush and the U.S. about half way through. So condescending. How modern.
B00CY5Y37U|5.0|I don't need to repeat what everybody else said. Great album with all the alternative mixes.<br /><br />My only complaint is that on the DVD, the audio quality really suffers on &#34;Runaway Horses&#34; and &#34;Summer Rain.&#34;  I think this might be a problem with the source masters because the UK iTunes version of this album sounds the same on those two videos.  It seems faint like the treble is turned all the way down (im not a sound expert though)  When I convert the dvd to iTunes music videos I may have to trace over the audio with the album audio version.
B005IS565S|4.0|I've enjoyed certain songs on this cd, however, I don't listen to every song on it. All in all, it's a good cd.
B008K9SG9K|3.0|I agree with a lot of the reviews about the distorted and muffled sound. It's takes a lot away from the songs throughout the album cause it feels like you're listening to a very cheaply produced album with great lyrics. I wouldn't say so much that this is a must buy album, it's a decent album with some great songs, but if you do plan to buy it then just know what to expect based on all these reviews.
B009B0L324|5.0|I've never had or heard an AC/DC cd that I didn't thoroughly enjoy and this cd is no exception.  I love this cd.
B00GH4R95C|4.0|a different retelling of a new myth and the best part was they waited until the movie was half over before using the S word
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Fun addictive game but doesn't work fully with my galaxy note 2. Had to reinstall several times.  All the graphics do not work.  Last straw was started freezing and lost my purchases, unacceptable customer service.  There are other fun games out there. I think this game is mostly hype and peer pressure.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I truly believe this movie should be intergrated in to the curriculm of every school in America!! Still unbelievable that people actually treated others that way and still do. There is no violence or nudity so I really think this is a great movie to watch with your kids. It is a definite must see in my opinion. The acting is flawless and the message is one that will stay with you forever.
B000N2HCM4|4.0|Interesting and well written.  Whether you like the man or not, this is book provides insight into the man's thinking.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Our family is really enjoying this series on planet earth.  It is well done and David Attenborough does an excellent job.  He gives one time to reflect as the beautiful photography stuns the senses.  And, he does not hype up his commentary.  We are very satisfied that we have made this purchase.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|If you liked the previous books, you'll love this one.  This book has to be one of my favorites in the series.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|I love this movie and I love the special features. Its so good I've watched it 8 times. Leo is the bae.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|In this day and age when our nation's political upheaval appears overwhelming, here's the story of a man faced with greater challenges than our current President.  The parallels between then and now are unnerving and at times astonishing.  This story is a glowing testimony of our greatest president.  Doris Kearns Goodwin is a terrific writer/historian and never fails to impress me.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone with even the slightest desire to understand the greatness of this man and the miracle of our country.
B00G5AVM3S|5.0|Thank goodness this app has some clever, FUN tools for photo editing, which allow me to create brand new looks like never before!<br />I'm so bored with the zillions of photo edit apps currently out there, but this app gets my creative juices flowing again! It has opened up new and exciting possibilities for my existing pics, and also has some beautiful professional pics available to experiment with!<br />For those of you looking for something new, for a buck ninety nine, you really can't go wrong!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I got hooked on the TV series and was hesitant to read the books.  I'm glad I decided to read the books, they add so much to the story...and, helped to clarify some things in the TV series.  The series was adapted from the books but the book's stories are slightly different (avoiding a boring read).  Highly recommend!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun and fast - over too soon.  Hope they add more rooms soon.  Some puzzles are pretty easy and others a little challenging.
B004RKXNDU|3.0|I purchased this book for my e-reader collection and, after re-reading for the first time since the 70's, was a bit underwhelmed.  Either the books on spy-craft have improved dramatically or maybe I'm not as young and innocent as I once was!
B007KLY8FA|5.0|I'm old school classic jazz.  I've enjoyed Ahmad Jamal's music for many years  To get 8 albums packaged like this and for such a great price did it for me.  I had a couple of these albums already but the price was too good for me not to buy.  The new albums to me collection would up cost little to nothing for such great music.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Now how do I make it my primary dictionary on my dang kindle fire?  Anyone?  Hello Amazon, are you there?
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|The five stars are for the series...<br />However, Amazon's description of 6 episodes for $7 was very misleading! What they really mean is 4 episodes and the 2 free previews you could have had without buying anything. So, I was very surprised to be charged for episode 5 when they very clearly said that I was buying the first 6!!!
B0000AM6IY|5.0|West Side Story, who hasn't seen it? The classic love story and the story of gangs in NY City at a certain time and in a dancing stage production. Not reality, but a beautiful thing to watch.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|A great story of how something kids think is funny is technically a form of bullying.  I loved how this story showed how little things that people thought were innocent turned into something bigger.  It shows the snowball affect and how each interaction you have with people can be positive or negative.  Great read for everyone!
B002R4K6AG|5.0|Not Bob's best work, but representative of who he was when he made it. I love the fact that he gave the profits to charity, it was one of the few times I heard his name involved with charity. Go Bob!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|WORKS GREAT, NO ISSUES. Does everything you need a basic calculator to do. I haven't had any problems, no force closes or glitches.
1932100660|5.0|An outstanding book on the strong link between diet and western diseases (e.g., heart disease and cancer) written by one of the primary researchers in the field that demonstrates conventional wisdom on this subject is not very wise.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I have enjoyed each round of golf; especially the use of multiple strategies to get the highest score.  THanks BIg Fish for a challenging game.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I use it all the time but do find that it does not update ans quickly as I would like.
B008JEJOCY|4.0|The first time I saw this type of shoe, a chef friend of mine was wearing them.  I was always under the impression that that is what they were designed for, standing long hours in kitchens.<br /><br />I bought them to wear around the house because the hard woods hurt my heels (age).  Slippers are too spongy and don't work.  I am really happy with these.<br /><br />That being said.  I am unsure that the different sole design makes for a better shoe because I do not have the comparison.  I do like the look, and I have worn these to work a time or two.
B00G4CXHSK|5.0|This is a great game for all ages. It has a good assortment of weapons and is both fun and puzzling.  Yes, Noddlecake has done a great job with this game.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This is the best tablet keyboard I have ever played.  I can't wait to see what's next from you guys. Great job!!
B00B5HQL50|4.0|It was fast paced, the typical bond movie. I enjoyed it.  I imagine the effects would have been better at the theatre but it was still good.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Happy to have gotten it! It's really fun to play and it keeps you on your toes!!!  It's awesome! Addicting app!!!
B002R5V7MG|5.0|After listening to his remarkable thirty-minute symphony it is my considered opinion that the talented composer John Adams has captured both the intensity and drama--the soul of our city-- as it was in the 1940s. If you haven't already, I highly recommend you  jump in and take a bath, a slow symphonic soak, in our CITY'S NOIR.  Thank you Mr. Adams. Truly gestational!  (Note- John Adams was born exactly one month to the day after Los Angeles' most NOIR MURDER, that of Elizabeth Short which occurred on January 15, 1947.)  Adams credits California historian  Kevin Starr and his &#34;Dream&#34; Series books for much of the inspiration for his piece.  Steve Hodel, Los Angeles
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is so much fun and sort of addicting. I would reccomend this to anybody who likes raising things.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Good/Easy read. I get a little lost in the battle scenes but it holds my attention and I can't wait to see what happens in the end.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Just a wonderful story line, captures you in the moments, McConaughey is supreb and while I can't reacll the names of the young boys, I am sure that they will be on the screen for years to come.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Good but not as good as the first two. Would have preferred a different ending as I was left with many questions.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I recimend this game to anyone if you don't get it that's your fault. Hopefully you get this game and have an awesome time playing it
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|The more depictions of alcoholism and the denial the better. It is a serious social problem that probably has had more impact on our society than almost any other dynamic that is haunting us. Denzel did a very nice job playing one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I think this is a really good game anyone who plays it will have a great experience. This is amazing I'm like omg when I play
