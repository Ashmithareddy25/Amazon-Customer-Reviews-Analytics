B0052UZIFA|5.0|SUPER ADDICTIVE AND SUPER FUN.  GREAT GAME TO PLAY WHILE BORED AT WORK.  MY FAVORITE GAME RIGHT NOW!  WORTH THE 2.99.
0470932139|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It's well illustrated and gorgeously printed, so Helen's work shines through. There's a lot of good information here: lighting, composition, camera basics, you name it. If you want to shoot great food photos, this book will help you a lot.<br /><br />There's one big thing that is missing imho, and that's post processing info. In a book that's supposed to be geared for digital photography, the processing chapter is woefully lacking. Sure, you need to learn how to shoot well and minimize processing in photoshop/lightroom/etc, but that's still an important part of the process. The publisher coulldn't have included 10-15 pages on white balance, exposure, etc, in Lightroom, which is what the author uses? Yeah, you can't make everyone happy by including details on every photo editing package, but even just one software app would have been useful.<br /><br />But overall, I'd buy this book again.
B003YLK2RI|5.0|Other reviews said it best. Great show, awesome videos, egomaniacal editing by Clown(which we could all do without). One thing, does anyone else have trouble with disck 1? All I am able to watch is the tour collage, but cant seem to access the Paul Grey interview. Tips?
B0034G4ORC|4.0|I need more info on the alien attackers, I need more more more, I guess that means a sequel? the film moved very fast, and I didn't get bored one time, Nothing like Independence Day. The acting is average from all, definitely a guy movie. Special effects are very good, but not special really. For me the Directing style is what stands out, The pace and the hectic style. very realistic in this regard. I feel as if the movie needed an extra hour.  more back story, more build up to the invasion, or at least some real in depth explanation of why, who, where, they were or came from. but in the end my complaints, will probably be applauded by others for that mystery. I want answers.
B004UXUSIM|5.0|If you have ever been to Paris or if you have never been to Paris, this is the film for you.  The photography and the music take you on a tour into the city as you will find it today and   then the story transports you back and forth between today and some of its past glory.  Owen Wilson is absolutely the perfect person to portray a young man torn between the inner  voice that speaks to him of the romance, creativity and enchantment of Paris and his current  dull and limiting existence with his fiance and her oh so stiff and stuffy family and friends.  Wilson seems to constantly be just on the edge of finding his own reality and the side trips   to visit with his artistic idols are what he needs to make that leap.   Carla Bruni is one of the most attractive and sensitive museum tour guides one could possibly  want to meet and the other characters are so perfectly suited to their roles that you might  might recognize some folks you know in their performances.  Now go to Paris, walk in the rain and find your true reality - it's worth the trip.
B004ZRV3AU|1.0|I have never cut bottles before, so I was really excited when I purchased this bottle cutter. I bought it in such a rush, that I didn't think to read all of the bad reviews. This bottle cutter did not work at all for me. I tried multiple bottles, using different techniques and trying to follow all of the instructions. My advice is that you shouldn't buy this bottle cutter. I am in the process of returning it. It's not worth the hassle! If you read other reviews, the majority of them will say something similar to my review.
014017821X|5.0|All these stories are brilliant -- but pay special attention to the title story The Bloody Chamber. See Catherine Breillet's film Bluebeard after reading for a good companion piece!
B003XTKMBC|5.0|This one is a must for all the Star Wars Fans.  Added bounus a light saber that lights up and superb finshing which is a trademark of Kotobukiya products.
B003TZ9EGO|3.0|The songs are definitely remixed as the title suggests and there are a few that really are catchy club dance remixes, but it struggles so much to be different that some songs aren't as smoothly remixed.  It's somewhat of a letdown after listening to the original songs but if you are a GaGa fanatic, then add it to your collection
B00127RAJY|5.0|After becoming tired of hours at the gym doing the same ol' cardio machines and weight machine combos; i decided to give this Jillian Michaels woman a try!!   I never thought I would be capable of doing high intensity exercises since I am not a very athletic woman! But boy, is Jillian proving me wrong! All the huffing, puffing and soreness is worth it! In 12 days, I have went from 146 to 138. 8 lbs lost and inches too! I cant wait till I get to my ideal weight: 125-130! Just 20 minutes of your day combined with healthy eating (and trust me, I am not starving myself at all, just eating in moderation and avoiding anything fried!) can definitely bring you the change you have dreamed of!! I never thought I would literally want to write a review for something that I have bought on Amazon, but for the first time I am taking the time to say that I highly recommend this DVD!!! So come on, stop saying: \\"If I could I would\\" and say: \\"If i can, I will!!!!\\" Thank you JILLIAN! okay, now time to workout!!! :)
B002QGUFWE|4.0|I normally do not follow the Pop/Rap culture being of the \\"older\\" generation of Hair Bands and heavy Metal, but after watching the madonn/ Alice Cooperish production show on Paladium, my husband and I decided to give this album a whirl.    Wow    For one the girl Can sing, and with quite a range, and not all just Pop (though most songs have that driving club backbeat that I've grown to love)  There are hints of Soul, Southern, Rcok, and Spanish flemenco mixed in.  some songs are a bit more discordant that nessesary but for the mst part she's spot on.  Definitely an album to add for a complete collector's collection.
B003Y5H556|3.0|Wow. I saw this movie in the theater and thought it was boring and a whatever movie. So, I rented the Alternate cut Blu-ray thinking they'd add some new scenes that will help the movie out, but I was wrong. There's nothing different, they only add a sex scene and change the ending a little bit and if you blink you'll miss the quick new ending. I love Amanda Seyfried, but this movie is a disappointment.<br /><br />2.5/5
1599218011|5.0|I use this book as a guide, not The Bible. There are parts I skipped that I didn't want to read--animal cruelty in the meat industry (had enough of that when I read Fast Food Nation), meditation/yoga (my idea of meditation is taking a walk alone and I am not a yoga fan). But the book is full of great info and it's nice to have it all in one place.    I'm on Day 5 of the cleanse, which I started b/c I've been eating horribly for the past year. I cheated and had a big piece of cake at my friend's birthday party last night, and let me tell you, I woke up this morning and felt like vomiting. So maybe the cleanse is working.    Again, I use the book as a guide. So I still use the microwave, even though I'm not supposed to. I'm not going to kill myself about it. Also, if you don't make much money and have a family to support this is going to seem like an expensive plan. If you don't live near a Trader Joe's (for cheap cleanse staples like almond butter, nut milk, etc.) and a place that sells inexpensive produce, this is not going to work. Making juices every day will take at least an extra hour out of your day to prep and clean, and I'm not sure how I'm going to make it for another 2 weeks while working.    One interesting thing about this cleanse is that I feel beyond full, prob. from all the roughage. You will definitely not be, and should not be hungry. But I find myself thinking about bread a lot, not so much for the taste, but for the texture in my mouth. Rice/corn/nut crackers seem to take the edge off a bit but it's definitely not the same!
0671027573|3.0|Another reviewer said she thought Linda Howard was 2 people.  I can't agree more.  How can the same author write \\"After the Night\\" (which I loved) and \\"Dream Man\\" (which I hated)? I think Linda Howard is a very talented writer, but with her, it is hit or miss.  For me \\"Mr. Perfect\\" fell right in the middle.  I wanted a lot more from this book.      Four friends put a list together of what it would take to be Mr. Perfect.  The list is right on -- truthful, honest, funny, good to look at, etc.  Of course, they add things like penis size on it.  The list goes viral on the internet, newspapers and national TV.  That was so amazingly ridiculous -- just wouldn't happen.  Maybe it would show up on some blogs, but that's about it.    One of the four friends, Jaine, moves in next to a cop, Sam, whom she immediately hates.  Of course, sparks fly and they hit it off.  I have no problem with that.  The first time they actually have sex is a great scene.  At one point he says that watching her throw a temper tantrum always gets him hard...  Jaine: Always?  Sam: Always. Like when you knocked over my trash can, then yelled at me and poked me in the chest.\\"  Jaine: You were hard?  Same: As a rock.  Jaine: Well, son of a b--    But... They won't have sex a week before this because they only have a condom and neither of them trust that she won't get pregnant.  But, she's been on the pill for 2 days and that's good enough for both of them!    Also, as soon as they have sex, he asks her to marry him. And, she says yes!  Wow -- that's some good sex!     The \\"list\\" and the murder mystery part were way over the top. Most of this book was beyond believable.  If you have nothing else to read, this book is fine.  Otherwise, pick something else.
B004Y03LQ2|5.0|I thought this compilation was awesome. I have always been an Iron Maiden fan and this collection showed their melodic growth over the years. Great buy.
B004XANKVO|5.0|The bag felt stiff, I've been using some of the high end Burton bags for years.  After I moved into this one and carried it around for a week, I think it is great.  Loads of room.  The iPad sleeve is awesome.  Only wished the external pockets were zipped.  A+ Thule.
B003YI3D4K|5.0|Sviatoslav Richter had been invited by impresario Sol Hurok to leave the Soviet Union for his first significant trip abroad. Following a brief stop in New York, Richter was scheduled to perform with the Chicago Symphony under Fritz Reiner but the conductor suddenly become ill and was hospitalized. At the last moment, Erich Leinsdorf was able to free himself from rehearsals at the Metropolitan Opera and with a police escort managed to rush to the Chicago concert. On Saturday night October 15, 1960 Richter made his American debut playing the Brahms B-flat Concerto to an ecstatic audience. Two days later he returned to Orchestra Hall to make his first American recording, repeating his triumph of that first concert. This stunning, incandescent and emotionally wrenching performance was the result.<br /><br />What one hears on this recording is a great artist suddenly free from all constraints and on an entirely new stage. His playing is full of youthful fire, of a probing and often restless musical intelligence combined with overwhelming power and incomparable technique. Soviet era pianists had a reputation for \\"pounding\\" the keyboard, imbued as they were with the emotionalism so loved by their Russian audiences. Richter never merely pounds the piano. He is far too elegant a pianist for such vulgar displays. During the concerto's frequent crescendos Richter seems to make the piano explode with sound yet it is always with finesse, and with unmistakable strength in reserve. He never abandons musical clarity for mere emotional display. And with Leinsdorf providing superb accompaniment, conducting the great Chicago Symphony Orchestra with urgency and drama, this performance is easily one of the great Brahms B-flat Concerto's on record. Also on this CD is a brilliant performance of the Beethoven Appassionata Sonata that would merit its own CD release.<br /><br />Both performances were originally released as RCA Victor Living Stereo LP's. Sound is newly remastered using the DSD recording process. Unfortunately, Sony no longer releases this famous line on three channel SACDs. I have commented elsewhere about this distressing development. Nevertheless, the sound on this standard red book CD is exemplary: crystal clear, warmly alive and with a wide sound stage that fills the room. When using my receiver's Dolby PLIIx decoder the music approximates the airy brilliance of an SACD. These are two unforgettable performances that feature spectacular artistry and they are recorded in pristine CD sound. This disc definitely merits consideration as an addition to your collection, no matter how many Brahms B-flat concertos it already contains. You will return to it often and dream of having attended that premiere concert more than half a century ago. This spectacular recording is as close as we will ever get.<br /><br />Mike Birmaness.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm not going to lie, Jillian kicks your ass... But I can gladly and easily say I've never been more appreciative for it!    I'm 20 years old and in my first week (I use a total body scale) I lost 4 pounds of fat and gained 5 pounds of muscle! I can already see the difference in my own body and everything! I was actually only able to do 4 days of this DVD because I got busy but still! If I would've been able to do all 7 days that would mean my results would have been even better! I plan on definitely making up for this week (I just finished a set actually) but I was totally blown away by my results! I even lost 3 inches off my waist.    It did make my upper thighs really sore but I worked through it and after day three they were completely gone. She's tough but if you suck it up and give it all you've got you'll see immediate results. I wish I could just hug this woman!

B0050PYNP8|4.0|How my ratings work:<br />5 - I really liked/loved it<br />4 - I liked it<br />3 - Could've been better/worth a look<br />2 - Just didn't live up to the potential<br />1 - Simply awful<br /><br />Warning: This review is more of a statement of personal beliefs. Although I do meantion the film.<br /><br />I don't feel I need to go into the plot as the editorial review and various customer reviews already do that. With that said, Paul was a very funny movie wiht a lot of great ideas. I love Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, these guys work very well off each other and amazing chemistry. They worked well with the other actors too and Seth Rogen did a great job voicing Paul. I've seen reviews that say something about a well desearved screw you to intellegent designers and how the movie bashes religion and what not. Personally, I don't see it. I myself am a practicing Catholic; I wouldn't call myself devout because I don't follow every aspect the Bible teaches, but I still believe in God. I also beleive in evolution, and just because Paul proves it to the devout Christian girl (wonderfully played by Kristen Wiig) doesn't mean that there's no God. If anything Paul tells us to believe what we believe but also be happy. The four stars are becaause I didn't like it as much has Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz, but I still enjoyed it a lot. This was an interesting turn for these two and I looked forward to seeing more.<br /><br />Oh sure I can't prove there is a God, but can someone actually prove there isn't? As for the whole created in His image, what image was that? Was it the physical form or a more spiritual form? God is whatever he wants to be. I think Kevin Smith's 1999 film Dogma gave the best example of that with having Alanis Morissette play God but Chris Rock as Rufus saying \\"She's not really a woman. She's not really anything.\\" And I like to hope Pegg and Frost, both atheists, are the kind of guys who don't care if people believe in God as long as they don't try to force their beliefs on them and vice versa. That's the wonderful thing of free will, choosing what you believe. I do see why people find it rediculous that there's some all powerful super being and I can even see some parts of the Bible to be out there and silly. But the fact that I still choose to believe in God and the overall fundamentals of Christianity I think that makes me a really good Christian. This doesn't mean I'm saying people who don't believe are bad, as I said believe what you want and be happy. The sad fact is in this day and age we have to walk on our tippy toes making sure we don't offend people, and that sucks. I admit though I wish the crazy devout Christians wouldn't shove it in the faces of others, but at the same time I don't want atheists to do the same and act as though believing in God is wrong. That's why I don't get people that are advocates for atheism and have special meetings with each other to talk about their beliefs (church anyone?) and try to get people to stop believing and go to their side. Why? Why does me believing in God bother you? Yes I know religion has caused a lot of trouble over the centuries, but it has also done good things. I'm never gonna believe that life would be better without religion, a certain episode of South Park gave a great example, because people in general are jerks and would still fight. Humans are competative, arrogant, and often stupid. But so are animals and I personally believe that if animals could use guns they would (it makes killing easier after all, which is why people use them :P)<br /><br />I can understand people being offended by the language and crude humor. That's something that's never bothered me and it's just a way certain people express themselves.

B004LI21KY|1.0|The quality of this transfer is bad beyond belief - no one could be expected to watch such blurry, weak images for more than ten minutes. I have to assume that the authors of the four positive reviews either watched another film or work for the outfit (identified only as \\"PD Productions\\") that is marketing this ripoff.   Fortunately, I held onto the VHS version of this classic that I bought 10-12 years ago - it's good enough, but not optimal; and so I was hoping a dvd would mean an improvement. Instead, it's in the trash and I'm out $13.
B002WPVNZM|5.0|This album fell into my \\"heard five songs from it on Pandora, gave them all a thumbs up, so I must buy\\" requirement.  I love artists whose music is so complex and interesting, that all the songs sound different.  Not just 11 or 12 that all sound the same. The only song I don't like is \\"Mercy\\"-and that's only because Amy Duffy totally nailed that song and made it her own.  I have no idea who wrote it or how old it is (forgive my musical ignorance) but she was born to sing that song.<br /><br />Anyhoo--the more I listen to this album, the more I love it.  Hearing something new each time.
B004ZH66XO|5.0|I got this app not exactly knowing what it was but became quite addicted to it, and its as simple as it sounds grow your fish!!, it's a simple game but still maintains a good level of challange  hd2- android
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I am using this headset mainly for call of duty: black ops and the sound quality is AMAZING. I can hear footsteps coming from either direction of me and it actually ads a whole new strategic aspect to the game. All you have to do is select surround sound in the audio settings but after that it is amazing. The mic is really good too for chatting with my friends. I havent had one single issue with it. It also sits really comfterably on my head. The only thing is, when i play for 5 or more hours i head headset hair where just above my ears u can see ive been wearing a headset all dad. haha
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|got this app after trying the free version and I have to say I highly recommend. it's must have app to have a game to play with a friend or even stranger.  very polished all around
B0056E3S4U|5.0|I can only say that at the first listen I loved it; from start to finish. I find myself walking around in the store singing all of the catchy beautifully written and sung songs on this CD. I have no desire to listen to anything else. It really is very, very good. I waited a long time for his second album to be released and I already knew that if it was David Cook I would in no way be disappointed, and I was right. It's a mature and well thought out album full of meaning and heart and of course David's talent as a song writer and excellent vocals. I suggest it whole heartedly.

0143039431|5.0|It would be impossible to do this book justice by writing the kind of former-English-major review one typically finds on Amazon.  Suffice it to say that this book was majestic, biblical in proportion, and utterly human.  Roughly eighty years after its first publication and it is still a timely commentary on the plight of the laborer, industrial agriculture, and the strength of community.  Breathtaking.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|This movie is pure fun. One important factor in grading a family movie is definitely laughter. My kids and I laughed through the whole movie. This movie was like a love letter to Brazil with the beautiful animation, catchy music, and depiction of life in Brazil as well. My daughters were literally dancing in the aisles during this movie! There isn't a big moral lesson that can be found, but it is one of my favorite family movies of the last few years!
B0036EH3U2|5.0|Great series, one of my favorite things put on screen; the blu-ray doesn't disappoint.    Just a note on the shipping quality from Amazon here. This is a big box set and Amazon ships it in a box twice the size of the set with packing material that doesn't cut it. There was shipping damage on both ends of the box. It was primarily cosmetic, but still, you are paying some bucks here. While you will save $30 from Amazon, you may want to check out other avenues to purchase and get a truly pristine set.    I love Amazon, just saying...
B0031RAOW8|5.0|Better than GOOD.  The WHOLE family can watch this.  All that's necessery to have with this movie is smiles and a box of kleenex. I bought the DVD and can't wait to share it with the rest of my family and friends..

B0050LJIRK|4.0|This album is actually not to bad.  Alot better than The Truth disaster.    If you liked the old style LB then youll enjoy this album.
B003L77G8I|4.0|Both these dramas are clever and a joy to watch. Can not understand why Life did not continue.   Probably did not fit the usual no brainer style of most American shows.
B002ZG980U|5.0|This is hands down one of the best movies of all time. I am positive it will crack the top 100 list and if it doesn't I will be pleasantly surprised. If you don't appreciate this movie for the sheer scenery you will appreciate it for the basis of the movie. I can watch this over and over again, hence the reason why I purchased it.
0525425578|5.0|I ordered the book for my husband, as he reads all John Grisham and Michael Connelly books.  He really liked it.  I pre-order all  books from these authors and he has never been disappointed.
B0050CQY1W|1.0|Why won't anyone say how bad the songs themselves are on this album.  Beyonce has a beautiful voice and is a wonderful performer - I have no problem with her, but lordy, whoever chose these songs for her should be fired.  I would rather hear her record an album of American standards - great songs - and interpret them however she wants than this dreck - really, come on people - these aren't good songs for such a talented singer.  Really
0736092269|4.0|4 Stars. There is still room for improvement, but overall this is the best anatomy that I have found on the market for bodybuilding purposes.
B002RKRTGO|1.0|This is a great story, but as others have already noted, this Kindle version is missing numerous passages. This leaves the reader without important information needed to understand the plot. Get a different version!
B0058P7KUA|5.0|Really fun arena game. Good take on the genre, although the humor is kinda &quot;meh&quot;. It's more new Duke than old Duke. Works perfectly on LG G2x.
0061784788|5.0|I have been waiting and waiting for this book to come out...and it was well worth the wait (and the hardcover book price)!  I started it last night and just finished it this afternoon and sat there, thinking, damn that was good!  I loved it.  Several times, I laughed out loud at Kowalski's comments.  Hilarious.  It was like going on an adventure with old friends...Gray, Painter, Seichan, etc.  Plot-wise,James Rollins did a great job researching and tying this book all together.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0058P7KUA|1.0|the controls SUCK. the game is stupid. I would give it ZERO stars. takes forever for the game to open. but I could careless the game its self sucks too.... boo boo boo.
B0058P7KUA|2.0|Crashes so much that I can barely play it! Every single time crashes within 2 minutes.<br />Whats fun about that? This bug really needs to be fixed.
0307719774|5.0|I got this journal because I wanted something I could use to track my life as I am in my last year of college but I never felt comfortable keeping journals where I had to write down random things.  Q and A a Day is a prefect solution!  You get asked questions that are not only fun but also thoughtful at times.  It takes only five minutes of the day, I do it every night before bed, and once you get around to the question again you may have a whole different answer!  It is a great idea and a great product.  The only thing that I would say is a negative is how thick the book is and it is a little harder to write in some areas but not enough to make you not want to.  One of the best things is the overall size as it is a small book that can easily fit in your purse or a travel item so you can fill it out even when you are on vacation if you wished.
B0058P7KUA|1.0|This game won't even start on my phone, it just sits on a black screen. This definitely needs to be updated. Inc CM7
0767903862|5.0|I really enjoyed this author's prose style and his ability to submerge himself into a culture in a thorough and humorous way. Not a travel guide in the strict sense but it is a secondary benefit to reading the book that you will have a list of things to do (and not do) after reading this book. His sense of humor is wicked and his willingness to go anywhere and do anything to get the story make this a great read.
1402210795|5.0|This is one of her better books and all of her books are wonderful.  I have read and reread them over the last thirty years and never tire of them. When I want to get \\"lost\\" in a story, I read Heyer.
076115728X|5.0|We just got this book yesterday and my kids [boys 4 and 6] have already had me read it with them over 10 times.  They love the pictures, flaps, and pull-outs, but they also really love the concept.  I have a feeling we will have a lot more oops! projects around our house!  I really love the theme that mistakes are an opportunity to grow, learn, create.  I think that is a really important lesson and this book illustrates it beautifully.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|I began reading this set of novels after watching HBO season 1 'Game of Thrones'.  The idea of a fortified ice wall which kept at bay an evil that isn't really defined was very original in my opinion as was the fantasy world of mainly human characters.  The first three books in this series kept my attention because the plot went forward at a slow but steady pace.  During this book though, the plot stagnated and many new characters were woven into the story which created way too many threads to maintain my interest since not one of the threads progressed the main plot line introduced in the original novel.      I would rate this book a 2 and the series as a whole a 3 with the concept a 5.    I am not sure what HBO plans to do with the 'Game of Throne' series because I think all of the good stuff has been used up in season 1.  They might get a season 2 out of it if they focus on the War of the 5 Kings, but once they get to the material in this novel....
B000BNI99K|4.0|This DVD collection was actually a gift for a Rod Stewart fan. He enjoyed it very much and lets just say he passed his appreciation along with me.. Thanks!
B004RC8NXI|1.0|This movie was a waste of time.  First of all, I think Natalie Portman did a crappy job of acting in this...but it may not have been all her fault, since the writing was crappy too.  It was totally unbelievable and at the same time totally predictable.  I think it could have been a great story if it had a more gradual middle script...I just think it unbelievalbe for Natalie's charactor to change that much.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone....
030745455X|1.0|The print in this book is too small because Vintage Books a Division of Random House, Inc. made a CHEAP copy by printing it on 4 1/4\\"  X  6 3/4\\"  size pages instead of the 5 1/4\\"  X  8\\" size pages of Larsson's first two books. It has 822 pages which makes it heavy and hard to hold and turn the pages. The real KICKER is that they sold this $7.99 book (that's the price listed on the back of this book I SBN 978-0-307-73996-4) to me for around $12.00 plus shipping!!!!!!!!!! What a RIP OFF.<br /><br />PEG
B00506NRBS|5.0|I stumbled upon this book after seeing a video in a tweet, about this book, and decided I might read it. Then a rainy day came, and with nothing to do, I downloaded the free sample to my Kindle. I liked it, and immediately went ahead and bought the full book.    I just want to thank the author. Not only is there a lot of useful information about doing business and starting a company, that you wont usually find in business related books. This book is also very humorous! I haven't read too many books in my life, but of those non fiction books I've read, this is the first one to make me laugh. I especially liked the part about the squid from Korea.    This is a must read if you're looking for a book to both entertain you, and to learn something from at the same time. Definitely a very inspiring and interesting book.
B0034G4ORC|4.0|Overview<br /><br />Every time I watch one of these alien invasion movies, I realize just how improbable the possibility of a victory for earth would really be. If there is anything out there with the technology to reach us with an army, they would simply poison all of us from our orbit and save themselves the trouble of engaging in street to street combat.<br /><br />The base of these movies is usually the same, we start getting beaten to a pulp until some hero figures out their weakness and in a nick of time we win, yeah right.<br /><br />Content of the Movie<br /><br />The hero here is Sgt. Michael Nantz (Aaron Eckhart - also of the Dark Knight - two face), he is not in the best of standing with his colleagues, having lost some of his men in a previous tour. He is about to retire when the `meteors' start crashing through the atmosphere and then into the ocean, near different cities across the earth.<br /><br />While the overall concept is not original, the close up focus on Sgt. Nantz, and his resolve to redeem himself from his present stigma adds much needed depth to the plot. The storyline maintains a good momentum as the marines try to rescue a few civilians.<br /><br />With this task completed, he now returns to his based, seeing the destruction there, he then goes after one of the central control ships. The action is almost non-stop and the acting is pretty descent. Overall it is a good watch, but not completely original.
B00000J2PH|5.0|This is the best music that I have listened to in a long time!  Carole King's personality and talent are timeless and are a pleasure on this quality cd.
B004SBQAL0|4.0|The first thing you need to realize is that after 4 comes 5. Not 6! But then again, who wants just another guy in this flick when you can have a girl on a motorcycle. But, I should get a part in the sequel, which should be rightly called, \\"I am Number 5\\" and well that would be me.<br /><br />This film, apart from my absence was quite entertaining.  Number 6 seems to be a lot brighter and more versed with her powers than Number 4, who seems to be more distracted by an earthling girl that's into photography.<br /><br />Henri's  (Timothy Olyphant)  performance is about the best in this film. He adds a certain level of seriousness to the film, and without this character, a lot of depth would have been lost.<br /><br />The Mogadorians, who are the bad guys in this film, add a nice spark of humor to the film, they are like just so weird. There is also a group of football players that Number 4 gets to try out his powers on,  the special effects are well done throughout the film.<br /><br />This film may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I still feel that has a pretty good entertainment value.
B0034G4P80|1.0|The actors really didn't seem to be trying. Natalie Portman was certainly miscast, not that she's that great to begin with. Norse mythology is far more interesting than this watered down rubbish.i was very, very bored watching this film.I wasted my money on this.
0385737955|4.0|The Maze Runner may be one of the most bizarre sci-fi/dystopia books I've read, but it sure hooked me in!  I could not put this book down; I was constantly on the edge of my seat, heart pounding, and freaking out! Needless to say, one of this book's best qualities is suspense!  What is really interesting about this book, is that the premise and events are so far-fetched, you have to suspend your disbelief a lot.  Normally, this bugs me, but it didn't for this book.  I was too intrigued and excited to care how out there it all seemed.  Though, by the end, I must admit that I still don't understand the reason for the entire maze set up.  It seems kind of pointless when things are figured out!  But, I figured that maybe things would come together and make more sense in the sequel.  Plus, there is a such a fun and varying cast of characters that are all very well characterized, so perhaps that all makes up for its downfalls.<br /><br />I highly recommend listening to this on audio book.  This has one of the best male narrators I've heard, and he does great with the different voices.  It really adds extra personality to the other kids.  It also reduces the urge to peek ahead and see what's going to happen! :)
0140143505|5.0|A bibliophile's dream...the sequel is great, too. I think one has to be an Anglophile, too, to love this book so much. And to have been exposed to the courtesies of a different time. And define bibliophile as not just someone who loves to read, but who loves the tangible book, the caress of the pages, the strength of the spine, the smell of paper...
157421327X|1.0|I learned that this booklet and other \\"zentangle\\" booklets teach how to draw the NeoPopRealism ink drawing's art form, created by artist Nadia Russ 22 years ago.<br />For some reason, Rick Roberts and Maria Thomas created new term for the NeoPopRealism ink drawing's art form, they call it \\"zentangle\\". They began to use 3.5\\"x3.5\\" square and claim that they \\"invented\\" this art form. They have their teaching method Patent pending since 2005. Too long, and it means they fail to patent their teaching method...<br />Recently, bunch of little booklets appeared where \\"Certified Zentangle Teachers\\" teach people how to make the NeoPopRealism ink drawings but call it \\"zentangle\\". Also, every book saying that Rick Roberts and Maria Thomas are creators of art form that was already created by Nadia Russ in 1989. Roberts and Thomas are not artists, not art teachers, nor art form creators. They created only word \\"zentangle\\" and the teaching method that fail to patent. How their Certificates can be valid Certificates? To be valid, these Certificates have to be signed by the original art form creator Nadia Russ.<br />All these booklets contain the false information. That is shame.

B001BKTEZA|3.0|I almost set this one aside out of anger and frustration because i thought this was not marked properly and i had bought a commentary.  I made this mistake because the introduction is incredibly long. then after the introduction-to-the-introduction, it begins a chapter-by-chapter breakdown and analysis. You might understand why i mistook this for the main body of text when i was 10% through the ebook and there was no sign of Steinbeck anywhere. If you are not a lit geek and don't want to read a complete commentary first, avoid my mistake and open the table of contents and go straight to chapter 1. Otherwise i thouroughly enjoyed this one. I wish Amazon would dump this version and find a cheaper original copy with the original introduction.
1400052181|4.0|Rebecca Sklott does a magnificent job telling this relatively unknown story. Great read for anyone interesting in historical research.  Sklott made me feel like I was their at Johns Hopikins around the time they unwittingly took Henrietta Lacks cells from her cancerous tumor.  Those cells were cultured and became an immortal cell line that were used for medical research. The book details Lack's family discovering this decades later and their struggle with what had happened.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|i don't care if the originals ever make it to blu although it would be nice.  I'm going to say that i think this set will be great in hi def no matter what.   and for all of us who grew up watching these movies, do we really care if they release them in 3D?  i know i don't.  i'll be almost 40 and have children by the time they are all released again.  the 3d, like most movies out now, will probably suck anyways.  plus am i going to wait until after all the 3d versions are released to 3d blurays with possible hopes that originals are on them.  nope. so i for one will be buying this set when released and not b and m about the originals not being on it.

B004XCUEU2|5.0|I watched this documentary first when it was on TV, and then they replayed it several times that weekend, and even though I was sick on the couch all weekend I watched the documentary three or four times.  Very entertaining, and learned so much about how talented and smart Dave Grohl is, but also what a great person he is, too.  I loved when he was playing the guitar for the recordings they did at his home, and his little daughter is tapping on his shoulder to get his attention, and he just laughs about it, and keeps on playing.  Then when he's done he goes out to the pool and swims with his daughter, he really seems to be down to earth.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought the PP1 sharpener to add to my survival kit. I carry a knife, fire steel, compass, flash light, and this sharpener on 20' of cord. I condensed the cord down to about 2.5' in a rip not weave. I always carry this on me when I trek into the backwoods. The sharpener added very little weight to my kit, and puts a quick edge on the knife.

0312944926|3.0|DIGITAL FORTRESS is a novel about computers and The Internet which is now terribly dated (it's set in the late 1990's), and comes across as quaint, or even, 'campy'. At one point near the end of the novel, one of the characters needs access to The Internet, and he is all but ecstatic to find that he has, \\"the best Netscape has to offer\\". Also, Dan Brown's writing is nothing to write home about, however he is better than James Patterson(with or without his collaborators), but not by much.<br /><br />TRANSLTR is a multi-billion dollar NSA computer system which was designed to break encryption codes. The ethical quandary which the novel examines is the limitation placed upon Free Speech. How can a nation allow complete privacy if foreign enemies can use The Internet to communicate and plan terrorist operations? The novel positions The National Security Agency and Electronic Frontier Foundation on opposite sides of this question. The NSA wants access to everything, and EFF desires complete privacy.<br /><br />\\"Digital Fortress\\" is the name of a piece of software which was designed by Ensei Tankado which is an encryption code which cannot be broken. Susan Fletcher works for the Crypto department within NSA, and her boss is Commander Strathmore, and they are working to prevent the release of this program. If this software goes viral then America's enemies will be able to utilize this program, and hide dangerous information at will. David Becker is Susan's fiance, and is sent to Spain by Strathmore to track down the key to Digital Fortress.<br /><br />Several plot twists unfold, and in the end, all codes can be broken because all things encrypted can be unmasked after all.<br /><br />\\"Who will guard the guards\\" is a worthwhile thought which is introduced to make the reader ponder this question. If the government has access to ALL correspondence, who will take steps to ensure that it doesn't misuse this power?<br /><br />All in all, DIGITAL FORTRESS only rates a C minus.
0525421580|3.0|I disliked the first six chapters. Chapter 7, it started to get better, and I was quite intrigued by the promise of the ending - which did not disappoint, in a [[ASIN:B000K7VHQE Little Miss Sunshine]] kind of way. The problem for me was that unlike [[ASIN:B000YABYLA Juno (Single-Disc Edition)]], where everyone in the movie speaks in a more original, more sparkling language, in this book it's only main characters who get to do so. Every line seems worked and reworked by intellectual college wits, although the characters are supposed to be in high school. It was too distilled, too boiled down.<br /><br />But the final scene made me cry. This was the gayest book I ever read, right up there with [[ASIN:1555838537 Stone Butch Blues: A Novel]]. Gotta thank the authors, even if they got a bit tricksy occasionally. And it should have been called \\"Tiny Cooper.\\" Does it really take two Will Graysons to make one Tiny Cooper? [[ASIN:0743273567 The Great Gatsby]] was not, after all, titled \\"Nick Carraway, Nick Carraway,\\" and this, perhaps, is the difference between writing a book that is topical and a book that becomes timeless.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|George RR Martin really did a great job with this dark fantasy series. The characters are dynamic, the plot is engaging, and the story is never predictable with many plot twists. I also really like the way in which the novel is written, jumping around between the different characters plot lines and sometimes converging stories.
0307279189|5.0|My husband bought this book from his sheer love of running.  When I picked it up a few months later, I could not put the book down.  The author is masterful in mixing the technical bits of running and the story that goes with it.  If it is true that humans were made for running and that it is supposed to be fun, I cant wait to discover it.  Being an amateur runner, I am frequently frustrated by my inability to run more than 10kms.  This book is truly inspirational and recommended for ALL runners and non-runners who want to give it a shot.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Just finished the red pyramid, and i would have to say it was very action packed and most of all story driven.  So i would have to say something that i would never thought i would say, that rick riorden is my new favorite author and PATTERSON is number 3, right after number 2 which is r.a. salvatore. can't wait to start book 2 in the series. I highly reccomend this book, this series, and this author for anyone looking for a great read.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Clever, great effects, great actors, great scripts. What more is there? And the Bluray shows it all off clearly. Too bad there were so few episodes...although the follow-up movie, Serenity, provided some closure.

B004VBAHG6|4.0|Always have loved Mr. Murphy whatever his present musical vehicle. Hes back to the solo work that truly separated him   from his Bauhaus coherts on this his NINTH solo cd not a major standout but solid and true to his more commercial form.  More in the Deep vein this time with pulsating guitar licks galore, Ninth really rocks out.  I get the feeling his soul is not in this type of pop rock but he knows its what his fans  demand so he sets sail and pays his dues so that the next album will be more as of settling DUST.  Kudos to Peter for giving us exactly what we like about him. He could fart jingle bells and I would  be enamored reguardless. Ninth is just what I needed.
B0041T52S6|5.0|One point that came up in the official movie critics' reviews was that this film couldn't be understood by anyone over 25. Baloney!<br />My twenties are long gone, I don't play video games, and I've never read the SP books. But, I freaking LOVE Scott Pilgrim vs. The World!<br />Found it accidently while flipping through HBO channels. Watched it with an initial reaction of \\"What in the....?\\" Then I just started laughing and never stopped till the end. SPVTW has been my latest and hardiest movie addiction, and I am enjoying the high. Thank goodness I have enough friends in their twenties, as well as young-at-heart older friends who can also get a kick out of it.<br />Will this be a cult classic? It already is! I won't do a synopsis, since you can look that up on the product page. But here is a list of some pros:<br />  * Funny as hell!! Well scripted, smart and clever.<br />  * Wonderful ensemble cast. There is no one in it that was slacking off. Big hugs to every character.<br />  * Stunning design and effects. Inspired direction and editing. Props to all the film crew. Beautiful!<br />  * The movie flows with an organic, colorful, spastic energy that whips you along like the most insane rollercoaster.<br />All you need to enjoy it is a sense of humor and adventurous fun, an appreciation for the weird and offbeat and the desire to experience a new kind of movie magic. Since it is such an unusual offering, do rent it first if you're not sure. But, I guarantee...most of you will be back to buy. :)<br />Caveat to the uptight: This film is a COMIC BOOK movie! Do not expect depth of plot or profound revelations here. Pure empty-calorie yumminess. Snickers, not spinach.<br />Special XXXXXXX (not the evil kind) to Edgar Wright - you maniac! - for creating an amazing world we want to visit again and again.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|When it comes to \\"survival\\" knives, there appear to be two all too common pathologies: 1) well-designed blades so pricey you shudder to actually do anything more assertive than arm-hair shaving with them and 2) poorly-designed poseur knives which look cool but simply are not well-suited to most survival/bushcraft applications (serrated Gerbers come to mind...).  Thankfully, the BK2 falls into neither category: this is an honest-to-God, affordable, no-frills survival blade which practically BEGS to be used and abused.    First a couple quibbles and negatives.  This knife is not a showpiece, and its workmanship is not without a few wrinkles and warts.  As an example, the BK2 I received isn't quite symmetrical...the blade and tang are not perfectly dead-nuts straight, and the grind on the blade is not perfectly centered either.  The paint job on the blade isn't perfectly uniform and scuffs easily.  Do these things really matter?  Not really, as long as you keep in mind that this thing is engineered for utility and robustness, not sex appeal.  Other than that, you've heard the other negatives from other reviewers: it's HEAVY, the blade may be a bit short for batoning thicker chunks of wood, it's too short to use as a machete, the handle is a bit slick and may be a bit large for small hands, etc.  It's all about priorities and trade offs...    Unlike the image Amazon shows, the exposed portion of the blade tang that projects past the butt end of the handle is flattened to provide a hammering surface.  Since the blade is only 1/4\\" thick, this surface may be a bit narrow for serious pounding, but should be passably functional.  If you're good with sharpeners, the carbon steel of the BK2 will readily sharpen to a wicked-scary edge.  Keep the blade coated with a thin film of mineral oil to prevent rust while still allowing you to safely use it for food prep in camp.  The Kydex sheath is great - the knife slides home with a satisfyingly positive \\"snap\\" and won't casually fallout, even without the retention strap.  The handle-retention strap on the belt loop is also thoughtfully positioned so that the sheathed knife won't flop around even when you're only using the belt loop.      Overall, a hefty, capable blade.  Highly recommended - just don't expect it to win any beauty contests or flatter your ultralight backpacking kit.
B0058FW26C|3.0|This film follows a group of marines through a war torn LA during an alien invasion. Although I have to give it credit for trying to inject some character development and realism into the standard alien invasion flick, I found myself slightly dissatisfied after finishing the film. There was nothing about the movie that was done badly. There was just so little originality that I felt like I had already watched it. You got your slew of marines ala Aliens. You got your District 9 mixed with V aliens. Throw in some Independence Day and Band and Brothers and voila! Battle Los Angeles. You won't feel like you've thrown your money away renting it, but this is not a flick you will remember in ten years. In fact, you'll probably forget it by this Christmas.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Excellent movie that should open up the consumers' eyes. My personal experiences at stock barns, farms, food factories, grocery stores, restaurants, etc., was realistic and many times a horror, but this movie shows us what our country has come to and what the average consumer isn't aware of, is complacent to, or just plain apathetic about.    It shows us who's running the country in regard to what we are dependent on... FOOD. It should kick the mentality of intelligent people into not buying into the propaganda we are fed, and becoming less dependent on the buying that we now experience. Peoples' lives are apparently not as precious as the almighty dollar. Our government is also slacking off by letting this go on by not putting more people with integrity into the jobs associated with our food consumption system. Animals as well as humans are being degraded and treated less than inhumane. Putting thought back into how we live now as compared to 50 years ago, may rattle some cages and the truth may get them to show some real patriotism and caring about others in this country.    I think that watching this movie would be educating as well as motivating to any human being who watches it! Diseases and health issues are rampant and this movie gives us a glimpse into that. What I really admire, is that this isn't a PETA documentary, but written by an omnivore just like me.    I thank Bill and Louise Daniels of WellSpring Lifestyle Retreat in Goodspring, TN for recommending this movie to me.     Carpe diem, ya'll! Make a difference, even if it's a small one.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|After browsing Amazon and Barnes and Noble for the perfect college-based romance novel I finally found it in Beautiful Disaster by Jamie McGuire.

I highly recommend this to anyone interested in romance novels.

B001A5OP4Q|5.0|So sorry the first reviewer had such a problem with the downloads. I have a Mac, and have had no problems watching these episodes of Mad Men, or any movie online through Amazon. Its also unfortunate that someone would give an episode a one star, as an opportunity to whine about a technical problem as opposed to writing about the episode...anyway...This episode is great; probably one of my all time favs. Probably because it has great examples of all the things fans enjoy about the show: historical context via an important event like the approaching 1960 presidential election between JFK and Nixon, the ultimate ad man's con, as he ruthlessly pursues Don, the men in the office at the height of their arrogance, self-entitlitled, sexist and sexually harassing worst... And then there is Betty...This may be one of her greatest episodes...possibly the first where we begin to see the complexity of her character, her family history, its effects on her parenting, and the toll of being a suburban housewife. Whatever you do, don't miss the ending...the best!!

B0010SKUYM|5.0|I loved this book. From the time Kvothe starts telling his story until the end, I couldn't put it down. This book is about the great Kvothe telling the story of his life in three days. This first book is the first day of him telling the story. It follows Kvothe from the time he's in his traveling troupe with his parents until his first couple of semesters at the University.     There are breaks throughout the book to let you know what's happening with Kvothe in the present that keep you just as entertained as his past story. There's a lot more to Kvothe the innkeeper and I can't wait to find out what that is.    The characters all have their own story and Kvothe tells us their stories as well, filling us in when we need it. The descriptions of the towns and the travels of Kvothe had me feeling like I was right next to him on his adventures.     All in all a great read!

B001L63JC8|3.0|You can hear the vocals much better in this version as well many details that usually got buried in the original. Much better mixes overall. I was really enjoying them until I realized the loudest parts seem oppressed. The music isn't allowed to breathe and get really loud and really quiet like on the original. When I checked this by importing the Mp3's into a computer the loudest parts are rife with clipping and digital distortion. To avoid this, buy the vinyl version and convert to Mp3 via a USB turntable.
031261246X|5.0|Everyone who knows about Windows computer security knows Mark Russinovich is an expert in his field. What came as a surprise is that he's also written a compelling novel. This book kept me turning page after page until the end, and I believe it serves as a wake-up call to all of us who have handed our lives over to computers to the extent we all have today. If you have even the slightest inkling of interest in this book, I recommend you pick it up and read it right away.
B001EAWME2|5.0|This is one of the best of the early Horror films ive ever seen, id defanitly recommend you see this. This in my opinion was much better then Last House on the Left and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Its right up there with the first Halloween and Friday the 13th movies. A Nightmare on Elm St. Doesnt touch this film. Again def. give this a shot, looks alot clearer on Blu-Ray, I couldn't beleive it was on blu ray already.
0061433047|4.0|This novel is an excellent continuation of the other world novels around Tiffany (hopefully, you've already read these). Tiffany  is 16 years old by now. This is a thrilling story. Among other things topics in this novel are prejudices and choice of occupation. Well-known people reappear in this story, but also new ones, such as Letitia, the fiance of Roland, and like Nanny Ogg. All in all a nice story in the style of the other Tiffany novels.<br /><br />On a personal/inspirational note, I find it extremely admirable that somebody can, being diagnosed with Alzheimers, still write so well. You can't notice any deterioration in his writing, and I wish him the best. I hope that he continues to publish these books, and continue beating back the disease.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|People who complain don't have devices that can properly run this game. thats why android games wont ever be properly rated. Because we all have different hardware in phones, and some people rate purely off of compatibility. The game itself is great.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I'm a huge fan of this series. It is tense, funny, outlandish, dramatic, and scary. Tremendous acting and strong characters. If you are a fan of Pulp Fiction and other crime genres with a twist, I think you'll like this.
0307272702|4.0|Update 2015-01-25: Revising my review upward a star. This is actually pretty funny. Earlier (2011) I had said, \\"avoiding bread, pasta, beer, sweets, and rice for the rest of my life is simply not workable\\". But last year I realized I have this condition called post-prandial hypotension -- basically very unpleasant low blood pressure dizzy spells after eating, especially after eating fast-digesting carbs. I no longer eat rice, bread, noodles, tortillas, or beer. I went from a high of 192 lbs to my current 145. I actually would like to GAIN some weight, given that I'm 6'0\\". I no longer get lunch comas, no longer have a disgusting beer gut.<br /><br />This isn't just from the diet. I also exercise more than I did before (6 miles a day on the bicycle). But I'm increasingly convinced that refined carbs DO have a big impact. I'm much more satiated eating foods with lots of protein and fat. I was never satiated on crackers and cookies and soda. You can eat loads of that stuff and not feel it. When I look around at people in the cafeteria at work who are overweight, I often see tons of bread, soda, etc. Coincidence? Maybe.<br /><br />I'll leave my 2011 review below for posterity.<br /><br />---<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer here when they said this was a low carb advocacy book masquerading as something else. Some of the science in it is interesting, but I can't help but feel the author might be cherry-picking his data. He references the same few scientists over and over again. And much of the book has a conspiratorial tone, as if health agencies have it out for us and are suppressing good science.<br /><br />Anecdotally, his argument against exercise to me is baffling and doesn't fit with my experience at all. I've always gained weight during long periods of being sedentary, and lost it again when I renewed activity. He argues that people like me subconsciously alter their diet when starting exercise plans. Kind of hard to argue with that, isn't it? \\"You may think you're losing weight from exercise, but you're making subtle food decisions that you're not even aware of too.\\"<br /><br />I wouldn't be surprised if the obesity epidemic does stem in part from our extreme use of refined sugars like HFCS. But hasn't the epidemic also coincided with the rise of video games (and other sedentary activities), increasing white collar office work, and cuts in school gyms and athletics? And even *if* the low carb diet works in reducing weight, is it a viable, long-term plan for most of us? For me, avoiding bread, pasta, beer, sweets, and rice for the rest of my life is simply not workable. Food is one of life's supreme pleasures, and eating it shouldn't be a battle and a test of our will.<br /><br />Much of these low carb, paleo, gluten free, raw foods, and other diets come across more as religions or lifestyles than simply diets. It leads to books like this that overstate their case or operate on selective evidence. Three stars for the book being entertaining and well-written and getting me to think about nutrition.
B004EYT932|5.0|This book is huge, a little scattered, doesn't provide any real \\"predictive\\" insight, but is a must-read for any experienced macro investor.<br /><br />One of the most well-researched, historical accounts of financial disasters and their causes that exists. Anyone that looks at the recent internet, real estate, and China bubbles will be nodding their head as they read this book.<br /><br />Definitely not to be consumed in one sitting, but rather one to keep on the bookshelf and used for reference. It's not an easy read and I would take it in sections depending on where your head is.<br /><br />If you like Black Swan stuff, behavioral economics stuff, and are a skeptic at heart - this is a good one for you.
B0058P7KUA|4.0|I would give this game 5 stars if it wasn't for the game restarting it self just when the main character gets to barry brains! Although I loved that zombie t-rex!
B002ZG994U|3.0|I ordered this DVD  a while back and finally watched it. at first it wouldn't load then 1/2 way thru it went to boxes and locked up. It took a while to get it out of my player and I started another DVD which played thru w/o problems. I waited too long to get a refund and it would cost more to ship it back for a reduced refund so I'm stuck with it. My problem. Note to self: run the DVDs ASAP to see if they work as advertised. I'll clean it and try again. Hopefully it will work this time. Buying a used disk is always chancey. Cleaned it and it played thru.
B00013RC9I|4.0|This is a pretty good album with very interesting and catchy songs. It's much better than the overrated Moon Safari. Biological is a romantically creepy song but it's my favorite on the album. Alpha Beta Gaga is an instrumental upbeat and fun song. Another day was a bit mysterious sounding and I liked it. Alone in Kyoto was decent and chill. Surfing on a Rocket was another favorite, especially after 1:34. The vocals mesh well with the music. At first I didn't think much of Mike Mills but the more I listen to it, the more I love it. It's becoming another favorite on this album. Run is one of the darkest songs in the album next to Biological and Another Day. I loved the music in Run but I wasn't fond of the computer vocals, but still a good song. My least favorite songs on this album are Universal Traveler, Cherry Blossom Girl, and Venus.     Generally an enjoyable album :)
B002ZG983M|5.0|The 2010 release 'Kick Ass' is exactly what the title indicates and more. The action, blood letting and witty dialogue never stop in this violent but funny superhero-on-steriod film starring Nicolas Cage (Big Daddy), Mark Strong (Kick-Ass) and the real star Chloe Moretz (Hit Girl). With great performances from Cage and Moretz trashing the bad guys has never been more fun. It's definitely not the brand of superheroes and caped crusaders I grew up with but once I got over the initial shock I was good to go!<br /><br />You might want to keep small children from viewing this one, at least until you've seen it yourself and are able to make an informed decision. In the meantime I'm ready to watch it again!
B000SX89TS|2.0|I don't understand how this album has a better rating than Talkie Walkie. The songs on this album bored me death. Everyone seems to prefer this album over Air's other albums but I think Talkie Walkie is much better. I liked nearly every song on Talkie Walkie and I only liked a few moments on Moon Safari. Overrated.

0375842209|5.0|I finished this book in about three days, torn from it by work and sleep. It was absolutely heartbreaking and by far the best book I have read in years.
B0050N65LU|5.0|I love this series and have every year thus far and I don't usually collect series. My only fear is that the series will end soon as all series must do. I will have to go back to watching reruns.
0891419063|5.0|E.B. Sledge's memoir of this brutal war experiences ranks among the greats of the genre, including Goodbye to All That, by Robert Graves, Memoirs of an Infantryman by Sigfried Sassoon, Undertones of War by Robert Bluden.  Sledge was probably too sensitive to face combat; it's a wonder he did not crack.  His scarifying book is difficult to read, even for someone like me, who has lived in peace because of the fighting men like Sledge endured.  Written with a strong voice, Sledge takes us through his training through the end of the war, detailing the various men he encounters under the most difficult of circumstances.  A great American classic.  By the way, the HBO series The Pacific softpedals this book to some degree.
B000002KLP|5.0|I LUV this CD...I played so much over the years and still, the sound remains interesting...  PARTY UP BABY and GET to GROOVIN: >  Big Up's 2 U prince 4 this one.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|There are edgy, avant-garde rhythms and there are also retro/80's references. Catchy melodies and positive messages. Lots of variety and potential singles. Quite amazing that she wrote and composed everything herself, and even co-produced the tracks. Without a doubt, her best album so far.
B004ZGI1V0|1.0|The plot is thin, the twists are trivial and action is nearly non-existent. I strongly recommend Liam Neeson's \\"Taken\\" -- a much more thrilling, exciting and well executed movie.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Great app, works perfectly on Droid X. I don't know what antivirus software some people are using (probably some crap free antivirus), but I use the paid AVG and it didn't flag this app at all. Considering AVG is one of the top antivirus programs available, I think I'll trust it.  As for the app itself - it is awesome beyond words. Love the ability to download the mp3, and my Poweramp music player adds the songs to my library without any problems. Love it!
0525425578|5.0|Theodore Boone: The Abduction is an excellent follow up to Theodore Boone: Kid Lawyer.  Grisham has a unique ability to express his stories from the viewpoint of a youngster.  I got an extra copy of Kid Lawyer for my ten-year old grandson, and he loved it.  Grisham may help a new generation develop an interest in reading.

B001V7U76S|1.0|I looked forward to reading this book, in part because of all of its great reviews. Buy this book if you want to spend the first 37 pages just trying to define what a game is. I will give you a hint: it is something people experience. If this insight makes you say, \\"Wow, man. That is deep.\\", you are either Cheech, Chong or part of the intended audience for this book. Hold on to your hats. He is just getting started. Soon, he will suggest you write down lists, with numbers! That's right, numbers! Numbered lists. Who would have thought to organize their thoughts by using numbered lists? This book is written in a breezy, conversational style by someone with nothing to say.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|Evo 4g, the game is awesome. Had no problems with loading, graphics, or gameplay. You have to restart your phone if it doesn't loss the first time, but it starts normally after the reset. STEAKFRIES!!!
0307269752|2.0|I found the Dragon Tattoo novel to be on the perverted side with unnecessary gratuitous sex and excessive violence...which speaks volumes about the Swedish preoccupation with the aforementioned topics. The story was fine although slow at the beginning and unbelievable towards the end and could have done without the addition of these gratuitous scenes. I will say that Lisbeth Salander is not believable or likeable and neither is Mikael Blomqvist.
0802473156|5.0|I am not married but I am currently in a long distance relationship. My boyfriend and I read this book because we found our relationship suffered without being together. It turns out he is a \\"quality time\\" man which he wasn't getting. And I like \\"words of affirmation\\" which I wasn't getting because he wasn't feeling loved. This book has been helpful for us to understand how to serve each other and be creative in our time apart.

B0025UHKNS|4.0|I have used the new Forerunner 405cx and have been very pleased.  I used to run with the 205 and like the newer model for the following reasons: 1. Speed is much improved when locating satellites.  I sometimes found myself standing and waiting for several minutes.  Now, in 30 seconds or less, I'm ready to run. 2. While it has taken some getting used to, I like the convenience of the touch bezel.  Much easier than trying to remember which button to press.  Some reviews have commented on the difficulty with the bezel when sweaty.  I have not noticed that.  A quick wipe of my finger on my shirt, and no problem.  I am a Mac user, so am extremely pleased that I can now sync my runs on my computer.  The web-based record keeping is great!
B0058VW36U|5.0|So much more fun than angry birds. Great user interface with touch screen controls.  Lots of challenging levels. Addictive!!! Well worth the 99&cent;. You'll fall in love with the monster!! Get it!!! Dev- please add more boxes soon. We are waiting with baited breath.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|I have been waiting for a zombie survival overhead shooter. I don't understand the story, but that's not the point. The weapons and equipment power ups flow great. I only wish the player could place barriers or barrels (the explosive kind).
B0032UYFA6|5.0|I got the DVD within 2 days of ordering it, and the product has been great.  Season 3 is wonderful, and has been just as good--if not better--than the spectacular Season 2.  Glad I have it to add to the collection!
B002VRZEYM|2.0|A thorough review and analysis of our food supply and national food infrastructure is an excellent topic for a documentary. And, in that spirit, I began watching this film with high hopes of learning more about the things I eat every day. Sadly, \\"Food, Inc.\\" turned out to be nothing more than a one-sided, biased film of the American food system that completely fails to educate the viewer with facts and data and instead relies on non-expert opinions and judgments to deliver a wholly anti-food industry message. Balancing food quantity, quality, and safety is no doubt a delicate balancing act that has global hunger implications -- I only wish this film covered more of that topic instead of simply slamming the food industry. Our food supply may not be perfect, but let's face it; it is the best in the world by a large margin. I really wish this film would have covered both what was good about the industry as well as identified areas for improvement instead of simply being a 100% negative review of the food system in the USA.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|This watch has really changed my running program.  It gives you a very specific goal that is easy to track. It is accurate and fun to use. There is a learning curve because it has a lot of different features.
B004GYOQ6A|2.0|Although listed as compatible with Honeycomb tablets on the Android Marketplace, this game only runs crudely on that platform and the Asus Transformer hardware. App often seem to become confused about X/Y axis or simple stops responding altogether. Experimentation with other orientation sensitive apps suggests the problem lays with this app and not the Honeycomb platform or Asus device. Real shame as the game otherwise looks like it might be a fun, casual time-waster, although even at best $2.99 is way too much for it.

B003UESJH4|5.0|I LOVED this movie, The reason I LOVE this movie so much is that FINALLY, FINALLY after 75 YEARS Bertie and Elizabeth get to be the A plot story instead of ALWAYS being relegated to the B plot story in the abdication of David for the woman he loved pffffft. Added on to that the fact that Bertie had a stammer that I never knew about until I saw this movie and that he had this friendship with Lionel Logue that people were not aware of and you realize that Bertie and Elizabeth had just as an incredible a story as David did with the abdication and the woman he loved. In the end I would choose Bertie and Elizabeth's life story over David's life story in an instant. I know this is a little late in the game But did ANYBODY give any thought or consideration to a MAKING OF BOOK for The King's Speech. Because I would LOVE to read a book like that on this particular movie.
B0034G4ORC|4.0|Independence day is the best, but this movie have great actors and the story is good. I don't like things sush as an alien with a croach head like Independence Day...it makes no sense to believe that an animal is more intelligent than a human...

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Loved this book. I didn't want to stop reading once I started it. I don't know if it was because this is the third book and I have come to know the characters better, but I enjoyed this one the most out of the series. This was mostly a courtroom drama, with preparing for the legal case taking up most of the book. The ending was satisfying and wrapped up most loose ends. I wish there was another book so I could follow the story even further. My only complaints with the book were the same as I had for the other two books. There are so many characters that it is hard to keep them all straight. Some of the names are similar, which only adds to the confusion
B0058P7KUA|5.0|People need to stop giving Apps bad reviews because of bad app store experiences. And if your phone sucks, get a new phone. This game is an awesome shooter. I can't stop playing it.
0345529057|2.0|The binding on these books were very poor.  I was not rough on this at all and already the books are falling apart.  Probably a poor glue job, but the book is absolutely trashed.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I have been thinking about e-publishing for a while, and have read several books on the subject.  This is the one that has really gotten me inspired, though.  I also read his first novel to see who was advising me and I LOVED it.  Highly recommend this and his fiction!
B001UV4XHY|4.0|Good show. Husband thought it was too slow but as a Harry potter fan I obviously need it to go w the rest of my set;)
B00005JLKN|1.0|Bad casting!  Bad adaptation of the book.  False ending.<br />Edward Norton seemed more like Doogie Howser than Will Graham; hardly believe him as an FBI agent and it's like he just got out of Acting 101 with his monotone delivery.  Harvey Keitel was unbelievable as Jack Crawford and would better suit a TV crime show with his usual delivery.  Ralph Fiennes is too damn good looking to play Francis Dolarhyde, someone I made out to be quite freaky looking from the book's adaptation of the character.<br />The story itself was cut up and moved slowly with a finale that wasn't even in the book itself.  There was no fear in this movie whatsoever..then again, never read a good book and then expect Hollywood to turn it into anything but a weak rendition of it.<br />Can't believe people gave this 5 stars, I barely wanted to give it one.<br />Read the book and don't waste your time with this movie!  Fail.
B00005N6KG|3.0|I just bought my third pair.  Yes, they sound good,  Yes, they are light and are ideal for running.  Yes, they fail in the same way since 2003 (or earlier!).  My first pair lasted many years, finally lost one channel.  My second pair lasted less than one year, lost one channel.  My third pair...well...Sony, listen up.  It's a great product, but if you can figure out how to keep the wires connected to the plug, I'd pay the extra $0.50 to make that happen.<br /><br />Update...I still use these as I hate earbuds for running.  My current pair just developed a buzz in the LH earpiece.  Went to Amazon to buy a couple of more sets - discontinued and the remaining old stock is jacked in price by 3-4x.  OK, community, what's the best available replacement?
0345529057|5.0|Having watched the first season of Game of Thrones on television, I thought the books must be equally good.  I bought the four book set because it was a better value than buying them sepearatly.  I am now in the third book, and do not regret my decision.  I have thoroughly enjoyed all I have read, so far.  I was excited to hear that fifth book is recently to be released.  Can't wait!
B0058P7KUA|3.0|Got bored after one and a half rounds because I'd played this game a hundred times before: a run o' the mill, 3/4 top-down melee shooter (with ironic, self-aware plot/dialogue thrown in.)  That said, the controls worked well and I liked how the second joystick shifted position to my finger, but otherwise it couldn't hold my attention.

B004EPZ084|5.0|I knew Horrible Bosses was going to be hilarious but it beat my expectations. There were moments where I wanted to fall to the floor in laughter. I like how unpredictable it was too. I wasn't sure if they were going to kill their bosses or not. Some good surprises. Collin Ferrel is classic, Kevin Spacey plays a great psycho and Jennifer Aniston...yeah she is just hot and was funny as h*ll. This is my favorite comedy so far this summer and I'll bet it will be other people's too.
B004SDEMD6|5.0|This is an amazing book, especially when you hear it on CD. I've never taken the time to write a review before, but this book is unforgettable. It really is a must for those of us who love our dogs and are convinced that they understand more about life and love than most of us humans do. Garth's grasp of the impact of cancer in both the spiritual and medical realms has been so helpful for me and my husband, Dan. While Dan is a medical doctor with decades of training and experience, we learned so much about the emotional and spiritual side of dealing with this disease when Dan  became a patient himself a few years ago. Although prior to reading the book we knew little about car racing, we're certain that the analogies Garth uses in his story are helping many people understand what families go through. He brings warmth, laughter and compassion into a heart-wrenching journey. His writing style is beautiful, humorous and spell-binding. Thanks, Garth!  Sherry Watts, Sarasota, FL
B004KSQN7C|5.0|You can say what you want about Britney Spears personal life, singing ability or that she can't dance anymore. But you can always bank on that she delivers a great, cutting edge pop album. This may be her best one yet. The production is amazing and so is the mix. This is one great sounding album. Compare it to Lady Gaga's 'Born This Way' for example, where the songs are also quite good but the mix, production and performances very amateurish. Femme Fatale is a stellar production all the way.    Some critics say that Britney can't sing anymore. This is completely irrelevant to me as her vocals are edited to perfection. What is important is that she IS Britney Spears, that her voice has a great tone and is completely unique. Who cares if her pitch may have been corrected in post production. All I care about is that the CD sounds great, and it does.    Also, the deluxe version has 16 tracks. You would think there would be a lot of fillers, which is the standard these days. But no. All the tracks are great. The four bonus tracks are just as good as the rest. If you don't have them, you're missing out big time.    Some people dismiss Britney as an artist. However. I think it's pretty clear at this point that she is very much responsible for the final product. She may not write most of her songs, but I think she has a lot to say in what goes on her albums. And that judgement is just as much an artistry as anything else.

B000E8N690|5.0|Johnny Cash has always been a favorite of mine.  I have read two biographies of his life, and purchased this film to see if the visual is as accurate as the written biography.  I am pleased to say that this film is a reliable reproduction of the life of Johnny and June (Carter) Cash.<br /><br />And what a wonderfully entertaining film this is!  I am keeping this one for my collection, and very few films make my collection - only those I want to see again (and again).  The acting performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are Oscar worthy and perhaps the best work either has ever done.  Phoenix becomes Johnny Cash, and we learn what a tortured man he was, and how June's love helped Johnny find peace and contentment.  Witherspoon becomes June Carter, down to her lovely voice and vivacious and energetic spirit.<br /><br />The songs are absolutely wonderful.  While they cannot compare to the originals by Johnny and June, they hold their own quite nicely.  (If interested in heaing a really neat album of duets by Johnny and June, I recommend this one: [[ASIN:B0000636Y6 Carryin' On With Johnny Cash & June Carter]]<br /><br />Nothing but praise for this heart-touching movie.<br /><br />kone

B004UXUSIM|3.0|Woody Allen's 2011 contribution to cinema has been heralded as a return to form by many critics, and for a few shining moments at the outset, it looks like it might just that as well be that way. Through a lovely montage of Parisian images by cinematographer Darius Khondji, Allen evokes the city's unabashed romanticism set to Sidney Bechet's nocturnally soulful saxophone on his composition \\"Si Tu Vois Ma Mere\\" much the same way the filmmaker captured the cosmopolitan energy of Manhattan set to Gershwin's grandiose \\"Rhapsody in Blue\\" in his [[ASIN:0792846109 1979 masterwork]]. The camera finally lands on the lead characters as they visit Claude Monet's picture-perfect gardens at Giverny. From there, Allen treads familiar territory following the adventures of Gil Pender, Allen's alter-ego, a successful but unfulfilled Hollywood screenwriter on a trip to Paris with his fianc&eacute;e Inez along with her wealthy, xenophobic parents who are funding the trip with typical bourgeoisie disdain.<br /><br />Longing to join the literary ranks of his heroes F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway, Gil, we discover, is working on his first novel much to Inez's chagrin. Enamored with the way Paris was during the 1920's, Gil soon finds himself in an alternate universe after midnight where he is rubbing elbows over martinis at jazz clubs with not only Fitzgerald and Hemingway but also influential figures like Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso, Cole Porter, and Salvador Dali. By the light of day, however, he faces the mundane reality of Inez and her family, who are completely indifferent to his flights of fancy. Matters get worse when Gil and Inez bump into Paul, an old college crush of hers, who has since become the type of intolerable pedant Allen skewered so well in the movie theater scene in [[ASIN:6304907729 Annie Hall]]. Gil - as he toggles between present-day Paris and his idealized vision of the city's past - will likely remind Allen's fans of the shenanigans that occurred in \\"The Purple Rose of Cairo\\" down to the introduction of an out-of-sync love interest, this time a beautiful clothing designer named Adriana, who was Modigliani's mistress and has now become Picasso's embattled lover. Allen obviously enjoys regaling in Jazz Age-era Paris and presumes his viewers will have more than a passing familiarity with the period.<br /><br />Thankfully, I just saw the Steins Collect at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, so I received a primer on some of these seminal figures. You can tell Allen is less interested in the contemporary scenes, which are not as arresting with these characters coming across more like stereotypes despite a game cast. As the hapless Gil, Owen Wilson is a bit improbable as a writer with high literary aspirations, but his sincerity in the role helps win us over. Back in [[ASIN:B0002IQJ8W Mean Girls]] mode, Rachel McAdams isn't given that much to do as Inez except to express constant frustration. Usually playing sincere historical figures like Tony Blair and David Frost, Michael Sheen has a field day as the entirely unlikeable Paul. There's a predictably no-nonsense turn by Kathy Bates as Stein and an over-the-top one by Adrian Brody as Dali. As Scott and Zelda, Tom Hiddleston (the malevolent Loki in [[ASIN:B0034G4P80 Thor]]) and especially Alison Pill play their archetypes quite well, but among the real-life figures, Corey Stoll stands out as the pugnacious Hemingway. As Adriana, Marion Cotillard makes the most of her fantasy figure role. All in all, this is solid work from Allen but still a fair distance from his most accomplished.of Cairo\\" down to the introduction of an out-of-sync love interest, this time a beautiful clothing designer named Adriana, who was Modigliani's mistress and has now become Picasso's embattled lover.

Usually playing sincere historical figures like Tony Blair and David Frost, Michael Sheen has a field day as the entirely unlikeable Paul. There's a predictably no-nonsense turn by Kathy Bates as Stein and an over-the-top one by Adrian Brody as Dali. As Scott and Zelda, Tom Hiddleston (the malevolent Loki in [[ASIN:B0034G4P80 Thor]]) and especially Alison Pill play their archetypes quite well, but among the real-life figures, Corey Stoll stands out as the pugnacious Hemingway. As Adriana, Marion Cotillard makes the most of her fantasy figure role. All in all, this is solid work from Allen but still a fair distance from his most accomplished.
0930289455|4.0|This is wonderful to read and a joy to look at!  The story is so grim and the characterization so strong that it is hard to put down.  Behind Watchmen, this may be my favorite Moore book.

0061998885|4.0|This might be the best Kenzie and Gennaro book.  The plot is so dark and the relationship between the two detectives so fraught at this point that this becomes interesting on both the criminal and psychological levels.  Lehane is better at exposing evil than almost any writer at work today and in this novel he might have done it better than ever.
B003Y5H542|5.0|I had high expectations after seeing this in theaters and knowing ILM material is made ideally for a format like Blu Ray, and without hesitation this is the best animated Blu I have seen since HD started.<br /><br />I am skipping the (for a better word) animated discussions about all of the hate and discontent towards this film, instead this is merely a product review. The picture and sound are flawless - as perfect as I have heard or seen on a film like this. Every frame is virtually a reference point for a multitude of factors, and the sound uses EVERY channel repeatedly; this is by far the movie to show off your home theater to friends with. The supplements are full of information and can be a worthy time investment (be sure to check the last one for the kids):<br /><br />* Extended version, 4 minutes longer. After watching both versions several times to try and catch the little differences, I painfully became aware I could have watched the deleted scenes to get the answer of what was changed (grrrr). All of the removals are even raunchier adult-themed jokes and material (the Tony Bennett one was funny though). The majority of the added-in footage is the last 3 minutes of the film - essentially an alternate adult ending.<br />* Commentary by the minds behind the film (extended version only). I preferred the documentary with these guys in it as there were too many participants for this commentary.<br />* Deleted scenes, 8:27 minutes in HD. All of these are actually what makes the extended version (them adding the footage on each beginning/start of the scenes is what makes this longer).<br />* Storyboard PiP reel, rated version. Once again I liked the documentaries over watching this but it does contain some great artwork.<br />* Behind the scenes, 2 docus totaling 48:52 minutes.

Always nice to watch the ILM crew do their art here.<br />* Real creatures of Dirt, 22:10 minutes.

I was not happy to realize you can't do that with an iPad.  Then I saw this product on Amazon and figured that, for $35 I'd give it a try.  Love it.

0061743526|4.0|It's easy to see why \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is considered a classic novel and why it had such an impact when it was published in 1960.  The primary injustice that it invokes still stings today.  We know that the past really was as bad as portrayed in the book, and we also know that things are still far from fair for people of all races, religions, sexual identities, etc.  Seeing the unjust conviction of Tom Robinson through the eyes of two children (Jem and Scout) makes it cut even deeper.     The book does a wonderful job of evoking an era and a lifestyle that just doesn't exist any more.  Times truly were slower during the Great Depression, especially outside of the major cities.  People didn't scurry around in the way they do now, as they used their energy simply to get by day-to-day and week-to-week. A school pageant was a major event.  Church was not optional or just a quick detour before your Sunday activities.     Where the book falters -- at least in the eyes of a modern adult reader -- is that it's not subtle.  Atticus, the father of the narrator, is perfect.  He's smart, caring, and calm. He treats Negroes with dignity.  He's brave when it matters, and he has a clear-eyed way of cutting through the hypocrisy of people in his town.  Jem is the All-American boy, always getting into lovable scrapes, and always getting away with it.  Scout (the narrator) is a tomboy with the perfect cutting response or the irresistably cut and innocent remark.  Calpurnia is the smart Negro cook and housekeeper who knows just how to discipline the kids enough.  The bad guys, such as the Ewells, have no redeeming features, except for Maybella, whose only redeeming feature is that she is lonely.  In other words, the details in the lives of the characters don't ring true, even though the over-arching story does.    It's not surprising that the book is assigned to middle schoolers today.  Anyone older than about 14 would feel the falsity in the all-good or all-bad of the characters.  Even the attempts to show that an \\"bad\\" person really isn't (such as the guy who pretends to be a drunk) are done in such an obvious manner that they simply aren't believable.  Of course, I didn't grow up in a small, isolated southern town .... so maybe I don't know what I'm talking about.

But the qualty of the picture of good. very clear. If you like these old movies this one is worth buying.
B002ZG981E|4.0|A gleaming, machine-tooled puzzle box of a movie which has justifiably spawned a plethora of theories about what's \\"real\\" in its narrative (and justifiable complaints that it didn't snag Christopher Nolan a Best Picture or Best Director nod).<br /><br />One's assessment of what's real hinges on one's assessment of the film's somewhat Byzantine explanation of how dreams work. Do you take at face value the \\"infinite subconscious\\" and the accelerated time of the dreams or don't you? Are the emblematic names of a couple of characters coincidental, aimed only at the viewer, or aimed at the \\"realness\\" of the dreamscape itself?<br /><br />Nolan's tale of a group of dream thiefs hired to implant an idea in the head of the new head of a multinational conglomerate falls down only, I suppose, in the realm of emotional depth and richness of characterization. But the actors are all so good at combining competence with a sort of post-James-Bond bitchiness that the whole affair goes down smoothly, though the James Bondian third level of the dream world bogs down a bit in pyrotechnics and too much gun-toting action.<br /><br />South Park accurately skewered the gobbledygook of the dream-world dynamics (Ellen Page has an occasionally thankless role as a sort of reverse-Basil Exposition, repeatedly getting DiCaprio's Cobb to explain how things work, sometimes at credibility-stretching moments). Nonetheless, the movie is a serious fun machine, and DiCaprio has really started to grow on me as an occasionally dewy eyed action hero.

B000CNESU8|5.0|Of local Canadian interest is the fact that the control room and news studio scenes in this movie were filmed at CFTO-TV in Scarborough. Weird! Of historical interest, Beatrice Straight somehow won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for a role with only 5 minutes and 40 seconds of screen time -- the shortest in Oscar history for a winning performance of any kind.<br /><br />Seen as a scathing satire of the changing face of network news when it came out in 1976, Network now seems prescient, almost creepily so. Our 24-hour-a-day news network world now delivers entertainment and scandal and blustery opinion far more than it delivers actual news. Reality TV has become the dominant mode of the dying networks. We watch people die 'live' on TV all the time.<br /><br />Peter Finch, who would die of heart failure before he won the Best Actor Oscar for this movie, plays Howard Beale, a long-time newsman who's about to be fired from his anchorman position at moribund, fictional fourth-network UBS. So he loses it on-air, vowing to kill himself on his last broadcast. Allowed to apologize on-air for that stunt, he instead launches into an impassioned rant against the modern American world...and becomes a ratings hit.<br /><br />So the network exploits him, shaping its new, news-free news hour around his increasingly bombastic, populist, apocalyptic rants. Veteran news producer Max Schumacher (an exhausted-looking William Holden) is appalled. So he's fired. Dunaway, as a new programming director, and Duvall, as the hatchet man for the multinational that's just purchased UBS, are delighted by Beale's ratings. A show that follows the real exploits of a homegrown terrorist group is greenlit by Dunaway, and also becomes a hit. Increasingly bleak hilarity ensues.<br /><br />The world of Network is pretty much the world we now see on a lot of our TV channels -- Beale is Glenn Beck with a better writer (that writer being long-time, award-winning writer for stage, screen and TV Paddy Chayefsky). The performances shine; Lumet may have been the most gifted 'actor's director' of his generation. Ned Beatty even gets a lovely turn as a megalomaniacal, evangelical corporate boss whose speech about how there are no nations anymore, only corporations, sends Beale into his final rhetorical and mental downwards spiral. A terrific, bleak, funny film.Lumet may have been the most gifted 'actor's director' of his generation.

0345529057|5.0|These books are a wonderful addition to anyone's library. They can be a difficult read though, they jump between story lines so you are learning what is going on with each kingdom at one time. It is a little difficult to read until you get to know the players. Then you are hooked and can't wait to find out what happens next.
0062060554|2.0|I bought the Kindle edition of this book based on the strong reviews this book received.  I was disappointed!    The book's concept is certainly intriguing, and I was immediately hooked.  The main character, Christine, wakes up each morning unable to remember anything from her life.  It is a unique idea from which to frame a story.  However, my interest waned as I started to read the second part of the book where the reader goes back through Christine's journal.  Two specific things bothered me:      1) The author is painstakingly slow in the manner in which clues are revealed to the reader to explain what is going on.  I get the sense that the book was originally written as a short story, and the author had to find ways to drag the story out into a novel.      2) Christine's journal is written in exactly the same style as the rest of the book.  The author is a good writer, and yet I found it hard to believe that Christine, the character, is as good a writer.  I also found it hard to believe that Christine would write, and have the time to write, in such extreme detail.    The way the plot ends up is interesting, and the last few chapters picked up a bit.  However, the author should have kept this as a short story.      Bottom line - if a friend hands you the book and you can read it for free, go for it.  But don't spend $13 on it!

B00012QM8G|5.0|Viewed: 2/04, 1/05, 7/06, 7/11<br />Rate: 10<br /><br />7/06: Schindler's List is the most honored film of all time along with Casablanca and automatically get the best picture of 90's award. There is a multitude of heartfelt scenes: frame by frame, scene by scene, and brilliance by brilliance. To see it again and again is to experience the joyous of filmmaking. This is the film that makes Steven Spielberg the greatest modern day filmmaker to ever live. D.W. Griffith was brilliant in his time and influenced how movies are made. Sergei Eisenstein gave something that forever changed the way movies are viewed. Alfred Hitchcock developed brilliance through techniques. Steven Spielberg took everything in and made into a culmination of one, and the result is Schindler's List. No film has this amount of acting, drama, emotions, atmosphere, stark truth and reality, and violence with humanity like Schindler's List. Moreover, it is undoubtedly the most important picture of humankind because Schindler's List tells a story to future audiences that evil can exist and how they can understand it. To see what had happened, the heroes of Schindler's List teach the values of life. I've never been more impressed when Steven Spielberg brought together two ordinary actors and got them to create something that is so extraordinarily great. Ralph Fiennes is the epitome of sexuality in an evil way. Schindler's List is through and through a definite masterpiece that has no rivals. Truth be told, it is absolutely impossible to regard this film anything less than perfection. Never have I seen a character so complex like Oskar Schindler. Amon...now, that's...power.<br /><br />7/11: Without a question, the best film of the decade.
0613028155|5.0|I'm loving the book but be warned that the library binding version is basically a paperback version with a hard exterior.  The pro is that it is also more travel friendly since it's the size of a paperback but the con is that the paper is not acid free so it will probably yellow and deteriorate over time.  If you are like me and want to keep this for your kids, spend the extra $3 and get the regular hardback.

1400032717|4.0|I like dogs.  If I could have a dog in the apartment where I currently live, I would be one of those folks who keeps dog biscuits in their pockets all the time, matches their furniture to the dog and whose car you couldn't see out the passenger window because of nose prints. Quite frankly, no therapist or shrink can do for me, what a puppy licking my face can.  As a cheap substitute, I read any book that has a dog in it.  Recently, the title that called from the B&N shelf, was The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime. However, this is not a book about a dog. It is a book about love, life, heartbreak , bravery and redemption, as told from the viewpoint of the 15 year old, literal minded, narrator, Christopher, a severely autistic British boy; a boy who doesn't like to be touched and cannot interpret emotions or understand feelings.  He views life within the parameters of a mathematical equation; physical laws and logic.  So when Wellington, the neighbors poodle, is skewered to death with a pitchfork; Christopher begins a quest to unravel the mystery of the murder.  And although Christopher does not understand what he is discovering, we, the reader do, and it is here, in this expertly woven tapestry of human frailty, that ordinary people, with extraordinary challenges become champions in their own lives.    The cast of characters are somewhat ordinary and this makes them easy to identify with.  A middle class father who works as a laborer, an estranged mother who couldn't handle the demands of an autistic child and leaves to create a new life, a special needs teacher who is the sole voice of reason and understanding for Christopher,  and Christopher himself , who acts as a `detective' to solve the mystery. Set on the backdrop of a small working class town, who do the best they can with what they know.  This stripped down, real cast, shapes a very raw and powerful read.  Mark Haddon's writing is simplistic and blunt-which gives it a  fresh, original voice.    And although this story is short and easy to read...(you will most probably finish it over a couple of lattes...), you will find that the the imprints it leaves on your heart, will last much longer.

B0012X6FR6|5.0|I started with \\"Everybody Digs Bill Evans\\" and moved on to the famous Village Vanguard sessions. The first was interesting but not awesome. The second was downright disappointing (lots of background noise, slow, brooding tunes, incredibly distracting drum work by Motian). One day I caught a radio cut from this CD and was so impressed that I ordered it. Wow! A great CD. Nice selection of standards, nice variety of tempos and lots of great piano virtuosity. Apparently Bill was feeling good for this recording session. I heard lots of great licks that I hadn't heard on the others. Aside from Motian's strange drumming, this is really pleasurable CD, worth many hours of study.
B001M5UDGS|4.0|\\"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog\\" is a short, highly entertaining send up of superhero films.  Neil Patrick Harris stars as Dr. Horrible, an archvillain wannabe, trying to be admitted to the League of Evil (headed by the notorious Bad Horse).  To do so he must demonstrate his worth by committing some heinous crime.    Unfortunately Dr. Horrible is (1) incredibly inept and (2) in love with Penny, a young woman he met at a laundromat.  Penny gets tangled up in his schemes, requiring him to save her, canceling the points he earns for his evil deeds.  To make matters worse, Dr. Horrible's muscle-bound, egotistical archnemesis, Capt. Hammer, also has taken a shine to Penny.    The action is punctuated by moments in which Dr. Horrible, Penny, Capt. Hammer and Bad Horse's ch3ering sections burst out in dreadful songs.    Harris is terrific as the pathetic villain.  The musical moments are priceless.  The script is witty, although on occasion it seems to get caught up in its own cleverness. The ending is rather weak.  But all in all, a very enjoyable way to spend 45 minutes.

B003Y5H54W|3.0|The most significant thing to note is that this isn't a movie version of the fairy tale, but a young adult werewolf movie very loosely based on the classic story.  The only similarities between the two are:<br /><br />1. Leading character has red cape (and a basket)<br />2. There's a wolf<br />3. There's a woodcutter<br />4. There are woods<br />5. There's a Grandmother who lives in the woods.<br /><br />Closer to \\"The Village\\" by M. Night Shyamalan than the \\"Twilight\\" movies, and without the plot twists, the movie focuses more on love triangles and Amanda Seyfried's face - \\"My, what big eyes you have!\\"<br /><br />In a nutshell:<br /><br />1. Girl loves boy, boy loves girl<br />2. Girl is promised to another boy with rich family<br />3. Elopement plans are made<br />4. Wolf spoils plans<br />5. Wild wolf-hunt ensues where everyone is a suspect<br />6. Wolf shows true colours<br />7. Girl loves boy, boy loves girl<br /><br />While the female characters are solid and well cast, the men disappoint big time. Gary Oldman tanks as a theatrically hammy witch hunter with weird fingernails and burly bodyguards, and when your leading men look wimpy compared to Robert Pattinson's \\"Edward\\" and Taylor Lautner's \\"Jacob\\" you should know you have a problem.<br /><br />Dramatic lighting, costumes and settings lend to the supposed \\"horror\\" theme, but the true horror is that the movie just doesn't work.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, July 10, 2011

That which was tedious and compulsory back then certainly came in handy today while watching this version of Charlotte Bronte's classic dark love story.<br /><br />Although the screenplay required some basic knowledge of the original to sort through the flashbacks and shortcuts, and to fill in the blanks for the many omissions therein, the settings, costumes and Gothic creepiness were right on target.  Well cast and acted, Mia Wasikowska and Dame Judi Dench were up to the task, while Michael Fassbender seemed to be a tad cranky and rude at the times when he ought to have been going for \\"cold and unapproachable.\\"  Never-the-less, he plays a reasonable facsimile of his character, despite looking more like Captain Von Trapp from \\"The Sound of Music\\" than Edward Fairfax Rochester.<br /><br />The only disappointment for me was the amended, truncated and abrupt ending, which totally ruined one of the best parts of the book, and where I actually could have quoted some of the dialogue, except it wasn't there.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of the classic looking for a good cinematic experience, but not for students looking for a visual CliffsNotes to help pass an exam.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, July 10, 2011
B0034G4P8U|3.0|I will start this review by stating that I was not a fan if the previous entry in the series. OK let's be honest here: I hated it. And I really really hated it. Hated it so much at it left me wondering how a movie about gigantic Robots fighting could be so boring. Hell, you know a movie really sucks when even the director himself admits it sucks. So with that said, I was nervous when the announcement of a third Trannys movie had occurred.<br /><br />Well for the most part, this review is full of compliments, but unfortunately, those compliments are for the technical stuff, and the acting.<br /><br />The storyline is not as confusing as ROTF, but it still is quite messy. 2 years after the events that took place in Revenge of the Fallen, Sam has a new girlfriend, a smoking hit British gal Named Carly, who used to work for the British embassy and now works at a Vintage car dealership with a creepy and obsessive boss (played cleverly by Patrick Dempsey). Sam gets a job at an office building, and his parents have came to DC to visit.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Autobots find new enemies at hand: Soundwave, and Laserbeak, and even more so- a piece from a deception has been found while they were on mission in the Ukraine. This leads to the discovery of the fact that the 1969 Space Race was in response to the crashing of an Autobot on the dark side of the moon, Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy). Suddenly, things get out of hand when Optimus unknowingly sets off a war, causing Sentinel to betray Optimus by working for the Decepticons and begin t use Earth as a source of renewal for Cybertron, making our future look bleak.<br /><br />Is your head hurting from reading the above two paragraphs? Don't worry, mine is hurting just from typing them (and on my iPad to boot).<br /><br />The action is simply stellar. I hated the shaky camera and quick cutting in the second movie, and so therefore a stationery camera and longer shots made it more easy to take. The finale lasts an hour long and boy does it rule. Some of the most spectacular action I have ever seen is in that hour, specifically  the scene where they slide down the building. It is worth it to see the movie in 3D, specifically for one scene: The wing suit scene. I got vertigo from that scene because I am TERRIFIED of heights!<br /><br />Admit it, you thought it would suck without Megan Fox. Well it actually is BETTER without that trashy gal. Rosie Huntington Whitely is so much hotter and way better at acting than Megan Fox. She can actually carry an emotion, unlike Fox. Furthermore Shia actually is great for once here, and he really shines. And boy, Leonard Nimoy stole the show! Live long and prosper, Sentinel! \\\\////<br /><br />Now for the bad. The story. \\"But that story doesn't sound messy!\\" It might not, but watch the movie. I found myself asking who was on whose side. Furthermore, the movie simply is too long. They dragged it out for longer than they needed to, and the film could have had maybe 20 minutes trimmed from it. As well as sam's parents UGGGGGHHHHHH. Also, is it just me or did the decepticons look all the same? It was hard to tell who was who because they looked too similar to each other. And Megatron should have had a bigger role. He literally is only in the movie for 5 minutes.<br /><br />In short, this movie is better than it's predecessor but still flawed and not as good as Tranny 1. I would recommend it solely on the strength of the action.and do go see in 3D too.the most spectacular action I have ever seen is in that hour, specifically  the scene where they slide down the building. It is worth it to see the movie in 3D, specifically for one scene: The wing suit scene. I got vertigo from that scene because I am TERRIFIED of heights!     Admit it, you thought it would suck without Megan Fox. Well it actually is BETTER without that trashy gal. Rosie Huntington Whitely is so much hotter and way better at acting than Megan Fox. She can actually carry an emotion, unlike Fox. Furthermore Shia actually is great for once here, and he really shines. And boy, Leonard Nimoy stole the show! Live long and prosper, Sentinel! \\\\////    Now for the bad. The story. \\"But that story doesn't sound messy!\\" It might not, but watch the movie. I found myself asking who was on whose side. Furthermore, the movie simply is too long. They dragged it out for longer than they needed to, and the film could have had maybe 20 minutes trimmed from it. As well as sam's parents UGGGGGHHHHHH.

B00005V0X5|5.0|Megadeth's first major effort, while not as technical and praised as their later works, may very well be their most fun work to actually listen to.  It's a strong album from start to finish, it's fast, and the music is perfect to not only get your head nodding, but to move around and sing along with as well.    I'm not going to waste your time with a track by track analysis, but the strongest songs (though all of them are great) are Last Rites/Loved to Deth, the title track, Mechanix, and Looking Down the Cross.  These Boots I could honestly care less about (it was the producer's idea to record it in the first place, and I don't condone covers from already established/popular songs, because it's pointless and lazy).  The bleeping is annoying, but it would probably be a song that I'd skip anyway (despite the music being excellent), so I don't see what everyone's big problem is with it.      As far as Dave's voice goes, it's definitely an acquired taste.  I enjoy it after listening to it extensively, but I'm willing to admit that the dude doesn't have a great voice.  That said, I admire someone who probably knows they're not the most talented, but still trucking through it and making a lengthly and successful career out of it.  He's carved a nice niche with his singing style, and it's *very* distinct.  To me, that's pretty cool, and you'll always know a Megadeth song when you hear it.    How this compares to Megadeth's later works is interesting, and a good topic for debate and conversation.  Rust in Peace has most of their classic works/strongest songs (Tornado of Souls, Holy Wars, Hangar 18, Polaris), and Peace Sells contains their most classic song (the title track) and maybe their best song of all time (My Last Words), but both albums have 2-3 filler songs that really take away from their impact overall.  This is where Killing is My Business shines, because like I said previously, there isn't a bad song on it.  It's a band in it's formative stages, and playing thefastest music they can, and it's still extremely catchy.  If you're a fan of thrash metal, or for some reason haven't heard KiMB despite being a Megadeth fan, you owe it to yourself to purchase (or listen to nonstop) the band's first effort.  You won't be disappointed (unless you come in with some kind of stupid grudge, and you know who you are).
0439023521|5.0|I cannot say I've ever read a book so fast. I started around 2pm today, and finished at 8, with only time for dinner and chores in between. Never have I had the pleasure of reading something that is so captivating and suspenseful as The Hunger Games. The characters are well developed, and with the many interconnecting stories throughout the story, you get a real sense of what it's like to live in Panem, without having a ton of information dropped on you, giving you the feeling that you are, in fact, reading a book, rather than living it. The story was well written, both in language and formation, and there was never a moment where I could predict the next move. Every twist and turn came at a surprise, and the moment I finished this book, it wasn't even a minute before I began wishing for a sequel (which I just bought... with the third book, too). Although this book does give you a heavy weight on your chest with the amount of death, there isn't too much gore and no sexual themes, which leaves the book readable for most. There was an occasional SAT word, but nothing that would leave you stumped, and although I can't say from experience, I do believe this book would be entertaining for boys and girls alike. As many have said before me, this is truly a classic, and one of my favorites, going on the same list as Fahrenheit 451 (by Ray Bradbury), Little Brother (by Cory Doctorow) and Incarceron (by Catherine Fisher).
B001FBJULI|5.0|I ordered all five of these remasters from Amazon in July 2011. I received the 2009 corrected versions of Movement, PCL and Technique. Brotherhood and Low-Life both are the older versions with the messy second disc. I am returning those two. People say you can tell the older pressings by two external signs:    1) The older pressings have the plastic \\"Collectors Edition\\" sleeve on the outside, and the newer pressings don't.  2) The newer pressings have a second book inside with details on all five remastered albums and the older ones don't.    This is actually a little bit misleading as the \\"Low-Life\\" I received did not have the plastic sleeve and did have the second booklet. So, I assumed it was the corrected version. But the second disc is obviously the flawed version with glaring glitches and pops throughout.    Perhaps Rhino is recycling all of the defective discs that have been returned to them, hoping less informed buyers won't notice. At any rate, be wary. They should have recalled the bad copies from retailers back in 2009.
B003Y5H542|4.0|Rango (animation, comedy, adventure)<br />Directed by Gore Verbinski<br />Starring the voices of Johnny Depp, Isla Fisher, Bill Nighy and Ned Beatty<br /><br />Paramount Pictures   2011   112 min   Rated PG   Released Jul 15, 2011<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />French: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Portuguese: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English, English SDH, French, Portuguese, Spanish<br /><br />Discs:<br />50GB Blu-ray Disc<br />DVD copy (with digital copy)<br /><br />The Film 4/5<br /><br />The Blu-ray includes the 107-minute theatrical version and a 112-minute extended version.<br /><br />Rango (Depp) is an aquatic chameleon who is trying to discover his purpose in life. He lives alone in a tank until the car it is being transported in hits a bump and gives him his freedom in the desert. His journey begins when he discovers an armadillo and is told to visit the nearby town of Dirt if he wants to find water. He's given a ride by Beans (Fisher), who owns land in the valley and drops him off in town.<br /><br />Rango begins the movie as a liar who is unsure of his capabilities, until dumb luck elevates him in the eyes of the locals and he starts to believe in himself. He represents hope as the townspeople struggle to find the water they need to survive.<br /><br />The first part of the story is not particularly encouraging. It moves at a frantic pace and initially relies on characters being hurt, and belch or fart jokes for comic relief. But things eventually settle down and the story starts to work. It references many movies from the Western genre, including True Grit and High Noon. Some scenes pay tribute to other movies such as Star Wars.<br /><br />The story is simple, but the setting and design of the characters is extremely detailed. There's also a wealth of voice talent in the supporting cast, including Ray Winstone, Harry Dean Stanton, Abigail Breslin and Timothy Olyphant, as well as the main cast.<br /><br />The dialogue isn't typical and a lot of it won't be easily understood by children. The characters mention chromosome pools, paradigm shifts and aquifers. Rango, in particular, is very articulate. It's quite refreshing to see this kind of thing in an animated movie. Maybe some of the kids will ask their parents to explain terms they don't understand. Even though some of the dialogue is complex, the story is easy to follow.<br /><br />The movie is a mix of fast-paced action, dumb jokes, clever jokes, battle scenes and quiet moments in which Rango contemplates his existence. There are problems to be solved, misunderstandings and traditional themes of good versus evil. One of my favorite elements is the use of a mariachi band, composed of four owls, documenting Rango's tale through the use of various songs.<br /><br />I won't reveal any more of the plot, but I found Rango to be an enjoyable ride. The first 30 minutes had me worried because of the pacing and the dumb jokes, but things improve significantly in the last hour. I often have problems adjusting to the style of North American animation after seeing one of Hayao Miyazaki's films, and I viewed Spirited Away a few days ago. Once I accepted that Rango was a totally different style; I started to enjoy it more.  It's not perfect, but it's well worth your time.<br /><br />Video Quality 5/5<br />If you've ever seen a Pixar movie on Blu-ray, you'll have an idea what to expect from Rango. I couldn't detect a single fault. Colors are striking and detail is exceptional. All of the backgrounds seem properly finished and add depth to the image. When you see Rango's face at the start of the movie, it looks like he's in the room with you. Clothing, skin, scenery and water are all displayed perfectly. This is a presentation that shows off the Blu-ray format wonderfully. Nobody will be disappointed withthe look of the movie.<br /><br />Audio Quality 5/5<br />The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track doesn't disappoint either. There's a lot going on throughout the movie and the lossless audio handles everything well. Some of the battle scenes are particularly loud, while other scenes rely on music for maximum effect.

B0034G4OVS|1.0|I'll start of by saying **SPOILER ALERT** even though so many of the other people who wrote \\"reviews\\" gave the entire movie away already, but I just might say something that hasn't already been said.<br /><br />Five minutes into this movie I already was thinking that none of the six people who had speaking parts had any acting ability.  Knowing from looking at the DVD box cover that this was going to be a movie about people being stranded on a ski lift by ten minutes into the movie none of the characters gave me any reason to care if any of them died.  By twenty minutes into the movie I started wishing they would all die and the rest of the movie would become a documentary on the lives of New England wolves.<br /><br />Even those who gave this movie more than 3 stars (How is that possible?  Are they all written by cast and crew?) agree that the three main characters are dismally stupid.<br /><br />Here are my favorite worst scenes:<br /><br />-  The movie is current day (2010) but we are to believe out of 3 young people only the girl has a cell phone and she would leave it in a locker at the lodge?  How possible is it that anyone of that age would ever go anywhere without a cell phone?<br /><br />-  One of the characters decides to jump 60', with his legs extended straight down.  What would be the obvious thing that would happen?  DUH!<br /><br />-  The lift cable is sharp enough to cut through gloves?<br /><br />-  The ONE chair on the entire lift that decides to fall off on its own is the one she is sitting in?<br /><br />-  She is 5' from a vicious pack of wolves that have a known taste for young skiers and they ignore her?<br /><br />-  Although they have parkas they leave their faces exposed to the bitter cold?<br /><br />-  And what's up with that Ski Cat that just happens to park under them?<br /><br />Much (most?) of the dialogue is unintelligible because of the whiney sobbing of the characters, not that you would want to hear it anyway, it is completely sappy.  The cheesy scream scenes during the crunch part of the movie were worse than the most low budget daytime soap opera.  The final 5 seconds of the movie summed up how I felt about the first 93 minutes ... I just didn't care.st low budget daytime soap opera.

B004L35GAQ|4.0|I'm not usually into pop music, but this cd is an exception to the rule. With the exception of the first couple short tracks, this cd is full of mostly upbeat, catchy tracks. Synth heavy pop with a touch of rock. My only issue is that some of the tracks such as \\"Burn It Down\\" get a bit repetitive. Highlights include, \\"People\\", \\"Guilty Filthy Soul\\", \\"Sail\\" and \\"Knights Of Shame\\". Really though the whole cd is worthy.

B000059XUP|1.0|This movie is low rate with poor plot lines and no character.  They ruined Sarah and made this crow lacking in character.  The ending was horrible.  A lot of the nudity was unnecessary.  The few things going for it is the gangsters were at least not cartonishly stupid and the movie's darker setting of depravity and hopelessness was believable.  Not worth watching it.  It is a shame because the original was so well written, had character was believable.
0449000729|3.0|This book tries to cover too much info over too long a period of time from 2000 BC to 1944 AD.It gets confusing as due to the length of time there are at least 120 or more characters.  It starts off with the ice age, to the Normans,to the Saxons,to the Vikings.It talks about conflict between the Bishop(Church) and Kings, the 1200's when Jews were the money lenders and then suppressed by the King with tax's,1350's The Black Death Plague, 1450's The merchants Guild when there is conflict between the church,King and Traders for power and money.    With little knowledge of history you can get well lost and bored at stages with this book.    Too much, Too much oh too much even for a big book of 1350 pages.    I enjoy the style of the book and the fast pace but maybe just span 100 years and two or three generations and get more into detail of a time and era rather than a sprinkle of history and a story and then jump ahead 100 years and then another little sprinkle of history and another generation then off again.
0743277708|5.0|As C.S. Lewis once said, \\"Sometimes fairy stories say best what's to be said.\\"<br /><br />Great stories have the capacity to shape us in a way that few other things can. They give us characters who exhibit virtues worthy of emulation. They show us how to persevere in the face of conflict, against villains, nature, and our own fears and failures. They inspire us to dream big, and to pursue our dreams against all odds.<br /><br />In Watership Down, Richard Adams has given us a fairy story of the highest order, and one that would certainly have pleased Lewis and his friends. Indeed, it now occupies a space on my bookshelf alongside The Chronicles of Narnia, The Lord of the Rings, and The Man Who Was Thursday. Like those books, it is sure to be pulled off the shelf many, many times!<br /><br />Would you believe me if I told you that this epic adventure full of heroism and suspense was a story about rabbits?<br /><br />Whereas most fairy tales immerse us in a place outside our own world, this one actually re-introduces us to a world we already know well (Watership Down is a real place in rural England), but in a totally different way. Told from the perspective of a colony of bunnies, this typical countryside is transformed into a vast and alien place! The several brief glances into the bizarre world of men add to the realism of the story, while often providing a chuckle as well (how would you describe things like cars, cigarettes, and boats if you had never seen them before... and you were a rabbit?).<br /><br />Besides the completely believable setting, Watership Down contains another vital element to a great fairy tale: well-rounded characters to whom readers can relate. Hazel, the main protagonist, lacks remarkable wit, intelligence, or strength, but possesses key leadership qualities, such as kindness and the ability to delegate authority and trust his friends. Bigwig is the impetuous sidekick who is good in a fight and loyal to a fault, but whose rash decisions often backfire. Blackberry sees the world differently; he can figure out how stuff works, and can devise a plan for just about any scenario. Bluebell is the jokester; Dandelion the storyteller. General Woundwort is a wonderfully detestable villain, but even he occasionally draws the sympathy of the reader.<br /><br />To round out the tale and draw readers fully into it, Adams has provided the rabbits with their own language (the book includes a Lapine glossary) and history. One of my favorite elements of the book were the stories-within-the-story, often told by Dandelion. Rarely do these stories actually advance the plot, but they reinforce the power of storytelling itself. They also reveal what passes for the rabbits' \\"religion\\", including a creation myth (complete with a \\"Fall\\" after El-ahrairah, the first rabbit, angers Frith, their \\"God\\") and an afterlife for rabbits who have \\"stopped running\\".<br /><br />A reader could enjoy this novel on many levels. As a simple story (which is all Adams ever claimed it to be), it is a pure pleasure to read. Yet, as with any truly great story, there is much to ponder here. As they seek to make a new home for themselves, the nomadic heroes encounter two vastly different rabbit civilizations, each portraying a society that has in some way sacrificed liberty for security, health, and wealth. The moral dilemmas our heroes face are familiar ones; how might we react in similar circumstances?<br /><br />Whether for intellectual fulfillment or \\"mere\\" reading pleasure, I commend this book to you highly. Tolkien's mark of a \\"true\\" fairy story was a sense of joy imparted upon readers. Watership Down certainly meets that criteria!<br /><br />\\"Far more powerful and poignant is the effect [of joy] in a serious tale of Faerie. In such stories, when the sudden turn comes, we get a piercing glimpse of joy, and heart's desire, that for a moment passes outside the frame, rends indeed the very web of story, and lets a gleam come through.\\" ~ J.R.R. Tolkien, On Fairy-Stories

It is very frustrating. I have follow the Stargate shows from SG1, Atlantis, then Universe. All the others ended well...

B004A8ZX2S|5.0|Miraculous that a project with such little dialogue, that spans roughly 20 billion years could be so straightforward and linear. It's testament to Malick's genius.     He's not philosophizing with the viewer, he's not educating the audience scientifically or spiritually. He is engaging in discussion. He is sharing the most intimate moments and thoughts of his upbringing. He is confessing his current dilemma.    There probably are two ways to appreciate this film. The first is to relate to the humanity in it. The second is to realize that it's a self-portrait.      P.S.  Renoir, Kirchner, Dali and others painted silent pictures. In his motion-painting, Malick includes inspiring musical scores at half the price of a day long museum pass.

It was the story of a spiritual journey and a woman's search for survival, emotional health, and balance. It rang true and the characters were believable and real. (Especially Richard from Texas!) The book never touched on anything even vaguely resembling depth or spirituality. It was fluffy, disjointed, and an insult to the book. I so looked forward to seeing it and was SOOOOO disappointed in this pitiful, fragmented movie.

0439023513|4.0|I'm so very thankful for the negative reviews--they allowed me to raise a little emotional armor against my Feeler instincts, instead looking through a Thinker lens, while reading \\"Mockingjay.\\" And that allowed me to love this ending of the \\"Hunger Games\\" trilogy.<br /><br />If you are reading this story as many of us will, specifically to *experience* this world through Katniss, and are hoping to feel the emotional satisfaction of great genre fiction, with character arcs completed and good guys triumphant and bad guys destroyed in the best possible ways? For the Feeler, this book may not wholly satisfy you. There's nothing wrong with reading this way, but it does carry with it expectations. When met, those expectations bring a rewarding blast of pure satisfaction that draws many of us back to the world of stories again and again. But unmet, those expectations can lead to disappointment, anger, even depression. For you, I would rate this book as a 3, not because it's not of high quality, but because it will not meet those expectations. It will meet enough of them to satisfy, but not if you expect that blast of pure joy.<br /><br />If you are a Thinker, and read for the challenge of figuring out what will happen next, of exploring the intricacies of the human condition, of seeing something \\"more realistic\\" (meaning grittier realistic than many of our realities will ever see)--for you, I would rate \\"Mockingjay\\" a 5 (or at least a 4.5).  You may forget this is in the end a YA book, or find yourself rolling your eyes at the crusts thrown to the emotional readers among us by the end, especially if you think intellectual reading is somehow superior to emotional reading (*sigh*). But there are enough shades of gray, enough questions to fill in ourselves (\\"why did Katniss say 'yes?' to Coin's proposal?\\" \\"was the pill, in the wardrobe, actually the pearl?\\") and enough little-moments-that-carry-great-weight (Gale and Katniss's last conversation), as well as name symbolism and historic parallels, to allow repeated reading and analysis for quite some time.<br /><br />Since most of us are a mixture of the two kinds of readers, I suggest you lower your emotional expectations and up your intellectual expectations. The trilogy never promised \\"feel good,\\" and gave us few purely \\"good guys\\" and plenty of indeterminate endings. So let the Mockingjay be the Mockingjay and, like me, you may find yourself supremely satisfied by the conclusion to Katniss's story.lels, to allow repeated reading and analysis for quite some time.    Since most of us are a mixture of the two kinds of readers, I suggest you lower your emotional expectations and up your intellectual expectations. The trilogy never promised \\"feel good,\\" and gave us few purely \\"good guys\\" and plenty of indeterminate endings. So let the Mockingjay be the Mockingjay and, like me, you may find yourself supremely satisfied by the conclusion to Katniss's story.
B004G6009K|4.0|I got this movie to show off my new 55\\" 3D TV... I think 3D was more of an after thought on this movie, but the movie was still fun to watch.  I haven't watched the movie a 2nd time, while I've watched my other 3D movies many times.
B000JFDBXO|4.0|I love these X-Men movies.  I just saw X-Men First Class in the theater and it didn't disappoint.  My favorite is Wolverine Origins.  Hugh Jackman is incredible!
B0043RSE2M|5.0|I wish there was an option to just buy the 3D disc alone, with no packaging, just an envelope.  I'm of the school of thought that having physical discs is going to be a thing of the past, very soon.  Great movie, fun to watch, especially in 3D.
B001ED7C5I|5.0|This is an excellent continuation bet from Tracy Chapman. Its filled with 5-star songs. Presenting in a very melodramatic, chilly and intelligent way, this album opens up plenty of Chapman's voice to give you the goosebumps. \\"Sing For You\\" and \\"Something to See\\" are like anthems for me.\\"Our Bright Future\\", \\"Thinking of You\\", and \\"A Theory\\" would be perfect in the background with their familiar folk waves. \\"Save Us All\\" will undoubtedly make you smile. This album is a for a personal listen, as most of Chapman's magical music is. Her voice heals!
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Caught this on Netflix. Huge fan of Season 1. The creators absolute genius taking what was to be flash back episode and giving us six episodes of twist turns and debauchery. To write an extensive review on a six epsiode prequel would be a huge spoiler. We do know how some characters end up, this is a prequel, but the story lines are excellent. It's not gratuitous porn, but very adult in violence and sex. The twists and turns these episodes take are good. It is six episodes so the story moves fast. Our champion Gannicus could have used more of a back story, it makes it hard to accpet him as champion just cause he is and watching how Crixxus came to be is a little heartbreaking. Lucretia and Quintas is at there finest, this is actually their story. And Gaia, Lucretia bff in this we just say she is a bad influence and she speaks you find self listening cause you never know what she is going to say or do. And other new charaters introduced does pave the way for alot more story telling. As of now I eagerly wait for the creators to pick up where they left off on Season 1, if/and probably will replace Andy W(he was awsome as Spartacus) we will go on. If another story is put out with Spartacus \\"then instert title here\\" its part of line/brand and we can just be thankful we have these stories to visit. Preorder preorder preorder you will not be dissappointed.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|This is an easy and short review from where I'm coming from. I began listening to Alice In Chains way back when the first lp and Dirt were out. I loved Layne's voice, and thought that along with Cantrell's amazing guitar playing, it was the heart of the band.      Nothing can bring Layne back, and I think he'd want this band to battle on; they've got too many good songs left to compose. It's that simple.      The songs on this album remind me so much of the Jar of Flies period of the band. I loved that album, and if you did, I would say to not hesitate in buying this one.      It's not Dirt, but it's damn good.      R.I.P. Layne, and may Alice In Chains continue to make great music.
1439102724|3.0|The latest Picoult novel tells the story of musical therapist Zoe Baxter, who has spent a decade trying to get pregnant. After she delivers a stillborn baby boy, her husband Max leaves her. Zoe then becomes a lesbian, and after she marries her partner Vanessa, Zoe realizes that she still has some embryos frozen. Meanwhile, Max has found Jesus, therefore thinking that Zoe will be going to hell. Max wants to give the eggs to his sister-in-law, who has also been trying to conceive. As in all Picoult books, a legal battle ensues.<br /><br />  Most of her novels have lately become quite formulaic. ***SPOILER ALERT*** I wish that she would tell more about Lucy and Sammy, and I really would like to know more about the relationship between Max and Liddy. I could see it coming: Max realizes that he loves Liddy, they hook up, and she leaves her husband Reid.<br /><br />  The CD was fantastic! I loved how each track fit so well with the corresponding chapter. All in all, it was so-so. The characters were pretty standard, but the plot was very interesting. A great book club read. I can promise that you will have lots to discuss!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This flash will really knock your socks off. It will light up a hall 60 feet long. With a shooting handle [I use a StroboFrame] it's impossible to get red-eye. I have several other speedlites that I use but I like this one because it is small but powerful. I stick in my pocket and it's ready to go. Alkaline or rechargeable batteries work perfect. I'm going buy a couple of more for fill light. The cost is low and the output is high! Certainly recommend this unit for any camera it fits. Stick a Model 400 Stofen plastic cover on the front and you will be happy. You can't beat Amazon's shipping system as it was delivered exactly as promised.

0756655730|5.0|There have been many many popular books on Dinosaurs and other aspects of prehistoric life but the present volume presents a new and high standard in such studies. The great points as I see them is 1) inclusion of oft neglected plant evolution along with the animal studies, 2) when covering Dinosaurs the authors pick mostly newly found specimens and not the same old pictures of the standard beasts seen in most \\"dino-books\\" and 3) inclusion of the exciting story of invertebrate sea-life that ultimately impounds most decisively on what goes on up here on land; I love all those Brachiopods. This is not a book for the novice; this is for the engaged mind that has some idea of some aspects of evolution and is curious about a deeper study of them. Yes you will have to go and search out some new information either in reference books or Google it. Yes Google knows what a spiriferid Brachiopod is or a rugose coral for that matter. I found it challengeing and fun to look up those terms new for me. I particularly enjoyed the several sections on plant evolution. I had the great fortune to audit a Paleobotany course given by Prof. Sir Peter Crane (one of the authors of this book)at the University of Chicago. It is a fascinating and challenging study. This book will be used by me many many times as I read and reread sections of it. A great treasure.

B002BJGYV2|2.0|I never watched the series when it was first aired but the DVDs were suggested to me by a friend.  The first three seasons are wonderful and season four is good.  I am part way through season five and I think I'm just done.  Characters have turned into caricatures and Rory has turned into a snob.  I don't like the Logan character and Luke and Lorelei (after all the waiting) don't seem very passionate about each other.  It's been hard to watch without hitting the fast forward button.

0743270754|4.0|This book about Lincoln was an eye opener.  The medium of exchange in the 1800's, if not before, was letter writing and the print media, newspapers.  People loved to communicate and so they did.  Lincoln was a fascinating person and he associated himself with some extraordinary men and women.  Some did not like him very much at first, but over a little time and some travail, they realized his greatness.  They all wanted his job, but none could succeed.  Some, like Chase, were so driven, that they made fools of themselves in the attempt to unseat Lincoln. This was a masterpiece of hardwork and research.  And it showed that if anything can go wrong,depending on what side you are on,  it will.   This story is very analogous to the modern day plight of Obama versus the Congress.  Many things will go wrong, and some may go right.  In all, you must keep your moral compass to navigate the twists and turns in life, both personal and political.
0307887960|5.0|Finally a diet I can follow!  My husband and I went on the diet after a number of times with HCG.  This diet I think I can follow for the rest of my life.  We lost 10 lbs a piece within the first two weeks and were never hungry.  We are in the third phase of the diet and no complaints.  The amount of protein you eat keeps you full and suprisingly I lost my sweet tooth!  I find myself reading more labels for fat and sugar content, eating oat bran that I never thought I would do and finding that you can actually eat out with out having to feel guilty or apologize.  You must read the whole book and follow the phases to be successful.  I think this is it and it makes sense.  Here's to a new way of eating!
1594202842|1.0|I just finished the book in one sitting and it left me with the worst feeling - the content, the style, the overall abuse. The whole way through I kept thinking,\\"just make it to the end and there'll be some redemption, some light to set it all right\\".  But that never came. What a jolt to get to the last chapter and realize the scheming hasn't stopped at all, rather it would appear that Chua is now merely seeking a new angle, a \\"hands off\\" back door approach with which to control her \\"rebellious\\" daughter.     Eager to see if others felt the same uneasiness at this discovery, I immediately turned to Amazon to read reviews. What a surprise was in store! I had no idea there was this much controversy going on over this book. As a lover of memoirs in general I just happened to pick it up at the library. All I can say after having finished the book now is I would pay good money (yes, Amazon!) to hear the husband's side of things. And the daughter's as well in the future. But as long as Chau maintains control I'd venture to say neither of those books will ever happen.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I'm not going to get into the nitty gritty details as John does that in his book (I'd have to charge $4.99 for this review) I found the information to be well laid out, excellent advice and very obviously his methods work well.<br /><br />Do I think everyone could use his methods and sell their books? Yes and no. I think like John says in his book, everyone COULD, but will they, that is where I think a lot of authors will fall down. They forget that while this is a writing business and the writing is central to the whole system, it is still a business and needs to be treated as such.<br /><br />For anyone wanting to treat their writing as a business and not just a passion or a hobby, then this is a great book, one that I easily reccomend.
159514188X|4.0|This was a tough read. It is very much heavier in subject matter than what I am used to but compelling and thought provoking enough for me not to put it down. It's one of those books that you think twice picking up but are glad you read it once it's through. Pat on the back to the author.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Well Crap, when do we get the follow up book?  Loved the characters, the attention to detail, the engagement in old works of literature.  Well done!  Can't say much more than that, other than when do we find out what happened in 1590?

B000063DFN|5.0|With Maiden's success getting bigger and bigger after the Piece of Mind tour, the band comes up with this offering, returning to the Bahamas at Compass Point Studios, and turns in a record that essentially, is an early crowning achievement for the group. All of the material presented here is top notch and the songwriting team of Adrian Smith and Bruce Dickinson once again comes up with the album's main single 2 Minutes to Midnight, but also pen another raging number with Back in the Village. Steve Harris' writing comes to an apex of sorts as he presents a musical interpretation (Maiden-ized of course) of the late 18th century poem Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, which closes the record out with THE most epic of all of Maiden's works thus far. When I was much younger, I remember purchasing Powerslave on cassette and was most intrigued by this track and it made me seek out the poem to further indulge myself within the wonders of classic literature. There's not many rock(or hard rock/metal) bands out there that can do this sort of thing, and this is what I've found so special about Iron Maiden; they're certainly in a league of their own as far as the lyrical aspect is concerned and I find that despite the heaviness in the band's sound, there's a bit more to them than meets the eye.    Harris continues with more quality songs in the opener, Aces High which has a fast, driving quality and descirbes a plane fighter's role within a combatative situation, be it a world war or even a personal battle within themseleves, depending upon one's interpetation. Losfer Words(get it?) is an instrumental that is aptly titled as it seems neither Steve nor Bruce could come up with a lyrical idea to accompany this chugging and melodic rocker. Dickinson turns in Flash of the Blade and the ambient title track and the band in turn give these numbers the Maiden treatment proper. The Duellists is yet another awesome offering from the pen of Steve Harris and is anothertop notch number within the Maiden catalogue. This is a band on display here that has reached an early peak in their recording career and and has clicked so well as an ensemble that its hard to compare them to any other band of the genre whom plays so magnificently together and creates music that is compelling, original and innovative. Powerslave remains an unmitigated success for Maiden, Up the Irons!!
B004WCTLNY|5.0|As a big fan of Phillip K. Dick, the brilliant but dyspeptic sci-fi writer who was in and out of mental  hospitals several times during his life, I was fascinated to see another movie based on his stories. Of course, many will remember the epic Harrison Ford movie from many years ago, \\"Bladerunner,\\" based on his famous novel, \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\", as well as the Schwarzenegger movie, \\"Total Recall,\\" based on his story, \\"We Can Remember it for you Wholesale.\\" This is a movie on a smaller, more intimate scale, which required greater attention to detail rather than a grand canvass, and it succeeds very well there in my opinion. Dick's Nebula award winning story, \\"The Father Thing,\\" about an alien being who appears human but controls the lives of millions, will also be remembered here by Dick fans.<br /><br />The idea of a secret organization that controls people's fates and even the fate of nations by making minute changes that propagate and magnify their effects over time is brilliant. Matt Damon and Terrence Stamp are superb in their roles, and I think Dick would have been pleased with the choice of actors and how the movie turned out. And for those of us with perennial cases of political paranoia, who always suspect that sinister forces are behind everything, big and small, that happens, this is a movie to be enjoyed and pondered.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I find that when starting a training session that the GPS can take a while to find the required amount of satellites, anywhere upto 5 minutes, when I use it for training on my bike can be a good few kilometers into the ride.

But other wise I find the watch's performance to be very good, I am thinking of getting a dedicated cycle computer for the riding side of my training.
B00000IQW5|4.0|This much maligned film by Spielberg seems somewhat dated, over 20 years later, but hardly worthy of the criticism it received at the time. A remake of the classic Tracy film from forty years earlier, A Guy Named Joe, it still possesses considerable appeal. But its main strength is in the wonderful performances of the three main leads, John Goodman, Holly Hunter, and Richard Dreyfus. And certainly last but not least, in her last screen role, Audrey Hepburn appears as an angel who is helping Dreyfus to make the transition to his new life. If there was ever an actress who could bring a  touch of class to any movie, no matter how good or bad, it was Hepburn. The story line, which has to do with the risky business of fire fighting pilots and fire jumpers,  has enough suspense and drama as any action movie theme you could think of, and isn't one that has been done before to my knowledge. Overall, a fine film which I think would have received far better critical acclaim had it not been done by Spielberg who sets the bar so high that even he has trouble meeting critic's expectations at times.
193413712X|5.0|\\"Tinkers\\" is a trance. It's unique. I'm not sure there are any comparisons out there. I've never read a book like it. Harding writes poetically in a kind of straightforward way. Is that possible? Yes. In spots, I had the feeling Harding was deconstructing poetry. He's not flashy, just descriptive and detailed. At the same time, he doesn't get mired in details. \\"Tinkers\\" is spare but rich, atmospheric yet gritty, light on its feet yet almost unbearably heavy.<br /><br />The themes emerge: Death. And, of course, dying. Perception. Memory. Family strife. Truth. Human decency. Beauty. Building a life from a harsh environment. Looking for order out of chaos.<br /><br />Don't be afraid of the \\"Pulitzer\\" label. \\"Tinkers\\" is one to admire and shows the possibilities of language and the power of words in the hands of original \\"thinkers.\\" Harding is one of those.
0439023521|5.0|I picked this book up for my 11 year old niece. I began flipping through it and could not put it down. Three days later I was finished and finally give it to her. Great story, not too far fetched.
061891868X|5.0|I read this book right after reading Leaonard Susskind's The Cosmic Landscape, and the dialog between the two works was a very interesting education.      Susskind spelled out the rationale for the Multiverse and a Cosmic Landscape of universes with different Cosmological Constants as a worldview, with the CC valudes determined by the varying properties of the possible String Theoreis that can hold in each universe.  This vision, which provides the only complete materialist metaphysics since the overturning of Newtonian physics over a century ago, has captivated most theoretical physicists, but it is a vision which has become increasingly divorced from science, as Smolin points out.    The major assumptions of this String Theory Multiverse are:    1-8 There are 8 additional dimensions to space.  9 The properties of everything are dependent on features of these 11 dimensions,  10 The features include whether a dimension unrolls  11 Also the shape of the dimension (number of holes)   12 Also number of twists  13 Also the flux value (integer) in each hole  14 Also number of 1-D branes (termination surfaces for strings)  15 Also number of 2-D branes  16 Also number of 3-D branes  17 Also number of 4-D branes  18 Also number of 5-D branes (I don't think any go higher than 5 now, not sure)  19 Whether any branes are negative (mentioned but not explained by Susskind)  20 Shape of the branes  21 Twist properties of the branes  22 Number of singularities (different from black holes)  23 TBD other mathematical structures  24 Specific string properties which create the elementary particles and fundamental forces (not sure if these are set by all of the above or not)  25 All of the above define the vacuum energy, and thus the cosmological constant (CC)  26 A high CC creates an inflating universe  27 Inflating universes can create mass and energy out of nothing, but it is all in balance, since gravitational energy is negative and exactly balances all the positive energy.  28 Fluxuations in the vacuum energy create transitions to lower CC regions within the inflating space  29 The \\"friction\\" transitioning from a higher to lower CC is released in the form of an elementary particle plasma (read hot Big Bang)  30 There is a texture to the Landscape of vacuum energy states, and new bubbles of a CC will transition down the slope of this landscape until they reach a local minima, or valley.  31 Only lower CC states can appear, not higher (not sure why)  32 There is a continuing cascade to a zero CC level (string theory models can easily create negative CC, so not sure why things stop at zero, negative CC would be lower energy than zero, so I think the model should not stop.  This is a problem for the Landscape, because if high negative CCs are the innate end point of the Landscape, all the universes will eventually just puff out)  33 Lot and lots of local minima exist (close to infinite, I think it depend on when you give up speculation on new arbitrary structures in the String Theory model)  34 All these local minima are actually reachable from the particular high CC local minima of the Eternal Inflation field. (this assumption is one where the non-science accusation may be valid.  Most of the minima will be vary far in properties from the starting condition, and the probability of a quantum fluxuation or tunneling effect reaching a distant state rather than the closest alternate state is vanishingly small.  But by postulating an infinite multiverse of Eternal Inflation, it would not matter if one state had 200 orders of magnitude greater probability of being reached - all possible states will be populated with infinite numbers of bubble universes.)  35 Anthropic Principle - life is rare and will only arise in an exotic very, very, few local minima which can support complex chemistry, and have long term stability.  That is why our universe is exotic and unusually stable.  36 Our universe had a CC that started in a nearly flat-bottomed trough that lead to our steep-sided valley      Just the major assumption level, this speculation/hypothesis is quite a doozy.    There are a number of predictions made by these theories.  The confirmed ones include:    * Flatness of the universe  * Homogeneity of the universe  * Size of galactic and galactic cluster mass concentrations    The unconfirmed ones include:  * At the very largest mass structure level, we will see the effect of a higher CC as the universe settled into the bottom of the trough  * A string theory model corresponds to our universe  * A series of string theory models correspond to the trough leading to our current valley  * Our universe has an edge with different properties, since it is continually transitioning high CC space around us into our low CC space (and we may be able to see a property variation, depending on how close we are to that edge.  Note this is my own conclusion, not Susskind's)  * Portions of our universe may or have already spontaneously dropped to a lower CC level.  These regions would grow within our universe, and be observable.  * Gravitons have zero mass, and behave like closed loop strings rather than strings with ends.    There are also two predictions which Susskind admits which currently are falsified:  * Our CC is calculable and small based on string theory (the math sums up to infinity - in order to get a finite CC they throw out all numbers larger than a certain arbitrary value)  * All the particles for which no rotational inertia has been observed to date (electrons, neutrinos, photons), actually have rotational inertia according to string theory    Lee Smolin adds to the refuations that Susskind is wiling to concede.    The first is that before String Theory, there were about a dozen attempts to unify quantum gravity and general relativity -- all of them were mathematically consistent, but every one made predictions that were tested and falsified.  Susskind is advocating that Physics be judged by mathematical consistency rather than experiment, but if we had not tested previously, we would now be using one of those falsified theories rather than String Theory.    The second of Smolin's additonal refuations is that the hidden dimensions of String Theory are unstable.  Quantum fluxuations cause them to spontaneously collapse, or inflate to infinity like our three conventional dimensions.  The ONLY way String Theory can lock them down so they are stable AND hidden is if they have a more complex shape than just being rolled into a tube.  String Theory has a prediction -- hidden dimensions will unroll -- that is disproven by observation.  What Susskind did not describe was the special case for these extra dimensions, which is the only way they could be stable, is that each must have at least two holes in it, and that each hole must have one or several charged Branes wrapped around the surface (basically a pretzel shape is the least complex stable shape).  Only then will they stay stable and hidden.  This is a bizarre kluge to the theory that makes it effectively absurd.      The third additional refutaiton is that String Theory for most of its history predicted a negative or zero cosmological constant.  Theorists worked with the zero CC versions until a small positive CC was discovered.   Then they found a way to further kluge the theory.  That is what the negative branes were invented for.  Branes are an imagined surface or shape (can be from 1 to 5 D) that the ends of strings must stay connected to.  They were first imagined in 2-D as membranes, then expanded into more Ds, and called D-branes, or just Branes.  A negative brane was never explained by Susskind, and I suspect it is just a mathematical artifact to somehow bring the vacuum energy to a positive value.  The addition of them to String theory is another patch to deal with a contrary observation.    Smolin points out that good theories are usually quickly confirmed by observations, and they suggest all sorts of new and surprising things which then advance physics in other areas.  The theories that have been discarded in physics are the ones which try to be kluged up with special cases to deal with one embarrassing observation after another.  This looks to me to be the case with String Theory.  Smolin started his book with 5 big questions that faced physics 30 years ago, when String Theory first became the dominant idea in theoretical physics, and that NONE of these have been solved in the last 30 years.  He thinks it is due to physics departing from testability, and embracing a theory which is infinitely klugable and non-falsifiable -- and as a result the experimentalists have been starved of viable theories to test to advance our understanding of these issues.      Smolin is a good and clear a writer, and he makes a convincing case against string theory and Susskind.  The abandonment of the principle of experimental confirmability at the core of science has been a disaster for physics.  Reading the two together, Smolin blows Susskind out of the water -- String Theory is a dead end.

B0034G4ORC|5.0|From my wife Sarah: I won't repeat the plot as many other reviewers already have. This was an excellent movie and here's why:<br /><br />- This was one of the most heart pumping, non-stop action flicks I've probably ever seen. Frankly I've been getting bored with the alien invasion movies, but this was pure adrenalin and really well done.<br /><br />- Not only was it truly exciting, but it had great characters and excellent character development. I was roped in and cared about the characters. This is an essential element of a good film, and this one had it.<br /><br />- Although this is fiction and the soldiers were fighting aliens, I think this film depicts the incredible bravery, honor and integrity of our armed forces in a deep way. It also showed some of the inner turmoil they might experience. It was fascinating and moving.<br /><br />- The acting was fantastic. Aaron Eckhart was brilliant, as were all of the other actors.<br /><br />- The special effects were fantastic and imaginative.<br /><br />The plot was fairly simple, but I was drawn in from start to finish. There were so many \\"wow\\" moments when my jaw was just hanging open. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes scifi, and to those who like action movies. This is absolutely not a movie for kids, pre-teens or sensitive teens.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|Most folks looking at battlestar gallactica the series, already know what they are looking for. This is for those who haven't seen this yet. This show is barely like the 1970s original. Names are the same, but the storyline has been altered a bit. I recommend this show to anyone who enjoys sci fi. There are too many twists to mention, the writters keep you guessing. Plus, the end is a twist you never see coming. On my personal scale I give the show a 9 of 10. On a more generalized scale I think this could be an        8 of 10.

B000SEGUDE|5.0|Most of the reviews focus on the unusual structure of the book. Each story is nested within the other, as a story discovered by or told to someone. Like any good metafictional strategy, this throws off your ability to suspend disbelief and \\"lose\\" yourself in the narrative, which may be why the reviewers are giving the narratives such short shrift. The structure undercuts each narrative in turn. The stories themselves are actually quite engaging and powerful, each in its own way, though, and to discount them as pastiche or whatever is to do a disservice to the author and to the book itself. I confess I found the Luisa Rey storyline a little boring, but that's probably because I've never liked political thrillers. Overall, though, a masterful work of storytelling -- and not just because of the structure, but also because of the stories. I can't stress that enough. It's not just an intellectual puzzle game. It's also a rip-roaring set of adventures.

The whole journey through these three amazing books was intense, amazing, and though it left me completely emotionally drained by the end, I can honestly say I enjoyed every minute.<br /><br />**Warning: Spoilers Ahead**<br /><br />This last book was the most emotionally draining rollercoaster ride I've ever been on while reading.  The first two books set us up expertly to be extremely attached to these characters, especially Peeta.  I was just as terrified for him as Katniss was and just as devastated when he came back to her so completely changed.  I cried when she received Cinna's final outfit for her and mourned Finnick and especially Prim.  The ability to evoke such strong emotion in me is what I love about all of The Hunger Games books.<br /><br />I personally did not expect anything but what I got in terms of tone and tragedy after the end of Catching Fire.  I knew the real war had just begun and I was in the hands of a brutally realistic writer.  Furthermore, our heroine was already established as being damaged and profoundly clueless about politics and leadership in any broad, world-changing way.  I, for one, never expected Katniss to be leading any revolution.  She admits on numerous occasions throughout the books that she never knows what to say to motivate people and she falls into the \\"Mockingjay\\" role completely on accident.  When Peeta's captured, Katniss lost the one person who supported her unconditionally and complimented Katniss's personality and abilities in a way that made them both stronger.<br /><br />I did not expect this book to be anything less than tragic and I was actually pleased with how optimistic the ending turned out to be.  The \\"real or not real\\" question at the end of the final chapter was moving in its simplicity.  The epilogue added a nice coda to show that Katniss was approaching normalcy again (though she can never be entirely normal) and living out her life in peace, which is what she seemed to want throughout the series.  It also showed that the lessons of The Hunger Games and the Capitol were being passed on to the next generation and so there was hope for the future.<br /><br />I could write more about how much I liked this whole series and this book in particular, but I'll stop here.  Five stars all the way and I'll definitely be looking for the next book from Ms. Collins.in peace, which is what she seemed to want throughout the series.

B0058VW36U|3.0|Once the game actually loaded it was very fun to play. I appreciate the well done cartoony graphics and gameplay, but loading time on my Galaxy S 4G can take upwards of 3 minutes before I am actually playing the game.
0316098329|5.0|Wow!  I don't know if I can find the right words to describe how this book made me feel.  Scared, disgusted, sad, touched, angry, and love.  There were so many emotions attached to every piece of this novel.  I have never read a book that held so much in its 321 pages.<br /><br />I was hesitant to read this, as I thought it was going to be very disturbing.  In the first 20 pages, or so, I thought \\"What have I gotten myself into\\".  There are parts, for obvious reasons, that are disturbing, but this book took turns I didn`t expect.  It ended up being about compassion, love and understanding, among many other things.  Seeing the world and what goes on in it, even through excruciating circumstances, through the eyes of a child makes the reader think in ways that we don't normally think.<br /><br />As the novel progressed, I quickly became hooked.  I found myself thinking about when I was going to be able to read more.  I was drawn to this book more than I have been drawn to any book that I can recall.  This is one of the best books I have read.  If you are hesitant to read this because of the nature of the material, or you think this is going to be a depressing read, think again.  I recommend giving this book a chance, because after 30 pages you will be hooked, and you won't be disappointed in the ending.
B004L03B3S|5.0|Although the Brazilin film \\"From Beginning to End\\" tackles the very controversial subject of homosexual love between two half brothers, it does not try to persuade the audience of its rightness or of its wrongness.  There is no \\"preaching\\" of its feelings.  What the film, to me, really shows is a beautiful love story between two individuals that happen to be half brothers.  Their love evolves and unfolds from early childhood with the film showing them as very \\"close\\" siblings--\\"rough housing\\", playing,  taking baths, looking after each other, etc,  The film shows a very ideal time  for them as kids and their \\"upper-class\\"  parents that only at one point question their \\"closeness\\".  The film shows their childhood kind of just unfolding as childhoods tend to do.  During this \\"childhood unfolding\\" Francisco and his younger half brother, Tom, fall deeper in love.  By the time adulthood is reached, the two very handsome half brothers (acted wonderfully and very naturally by two beautiful Brazilian actors) are in a \\"full blown\\" love affair.<br /><br />Adult love affairs tend to always have a problem or two.  Francisco and Tom are separated and their love for each other is, of course, threatened.  However, love wins out and how it wins out makes for a very enjoyable and very romantic movie that I loved.  I \\"welled up\\" with tears by the end of this very beautiful and very romantic(with a very nice sound track) film indeed.
0061537969|1.0|I fell for this book because I love dogs but once I started reading it, I realized that Stein possessed little of the \\"art\\" needed to be a fine novelist and even less of a true sense for what a dog might be like if one could actually think and talk like we do.  Stein's metaphors are off target and his attempts at symbolism are obvious and overreaching.  The weakness of featuring the dog's voice so completely in the narrative detracts from his ablity to draw his human characters adeptly.  The large font and leading should have been an immediate clue that his plot development was thin and calculating.  I actually couldn't even finish this book because I found the writing so deficient of any imaginative power.  Compared to The Story of Edgar Sawtelle, another novel featuring dogs, The Art of Racing in the Rain is a second rate effort at best.  I wish I could get my fifteen bucks back!
B000ECXWVI|1.0|This movie was most disappointing.  I thought it was going to be a story about the Navajo code talkers and their significant contribution to the war in the Pacific against the Japanese.  It never once told why the Japanese wanted so desperately to capture a Navajo in order to break the code for them.  Nor did it even delve into why this code bedeviled the Japanese.  The movie mostly was just battlefield shooting, blood and guts, and Nicholas Cage and his flashbacks.  Save your money on this one.  Buy instead the History Channel's show on the Code Talkers.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|Epic 4g: Awesome fluid graphics and fun gameplay. Wish there was more campaign levels. Really weird and random humor. Zombies!
0375703861|4.0|This is an entertaining book.  It's a shame that her others haven't been quite as good but this is definitely worth reading.
0446613444|3.0|It is telling that most reviewers who did not like the book start by saying; \\"I am a great fan of Connelly, but...\\" We don't do that for many authors: it is like Connelly has become a friend of the family. Well, it is not his best book, however close you feel to Connelly. Bosch, the detective, always behaves as he pleases and defies authority, which is pleasant, but in this book his amusing rebellion goes too far: I don't think any real police force would put up with it. In fact, I don't know any professional group who would put up with it, be it the world of fashion, lawyers, or hospitals. We all work within ground rules, even the mavericks of this world. This contributes to the many details which make the story incredible. There is something wrong in the plot with the details of this suicide turned murder. And Bosch's sex life is so random, it is really getting on my nerves.<br />What saves the book is that it is a reflection on why some people turn bad, and in this case, through multiple small touches and symbols, we get close to an answer.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Works as described, it's free and has no ads. And since it saves notes to the micro SD you don't have to worry about losing them.
B004RLN3QG|5.0|I have only been listening to JB for about a month but the rest of my music collection has been shelved, dust bowl has led me to black country communion and the vast back catalogue of joe. If you haven't listened to this guy this is a great intro and it isn't his best work but maybe his most accessible. Highly polished with great production. Many reviewers have commented on Joe's voice improving and it is more prominent and powerful on this than earlier albums. I class myself as a lover of good music and find it hard to believe I hadn't heard of a musician this talented but oh boy if you like a track with a good beat, great guitar and involving lyrics this album will lead to new education. Looking on youtube the guys stage presence is not cool to look at and that may be the reason for lack of mainstream opportunity but any lover of music will think this is cool as hell  As a reviewer stated about BCC, not a fan supergroup but a musician super group and this album showed me the light.
0307477479|2.0|After 100 pages, I gave up. Although nicely written, the characters left me cold. I couldn't relate to any of them, and some even left me wondering why they were even included. Also, the format of the book made it difficult to engage, to get that excitement from reading when you wonder what's going to happen next. With these characters, I just didn't care. I'm amazed that this book is getting so much positive press.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's a Joss Whedon production, great stuff. Funny and Smart. Quirky but yet adventurous. You will love the characters. Very unpredictable and entertaining.     I just wish they didn't cancel the show.
B0058P7KUA|4.0|My only complaint is it is too short! Well that and the flamethrower seems the most underpowered weapon in the game. It needs to be tweaked. This game is cool. More levels! Please! Finished too quickly! Really funny humor and voicework for the weapons I each period!
B0006B2A42|5.0|After last seeing this movie more than 15 years ago, I still enjoyed every bit of it. Good quality DVD, arrived on date promised, and enjoyed a super movie on a hot, hot June afternoon.
B004OR1X6A|5.0|Hey Amazon it would be nice if you put SOME info on your site. Where was the live portion performed? San Francisco I assume? What venue? What date? How 'bout a track listing? How is the packaging? Booklet w/ pics/info? What a pain to have to sift through reviews to get basic info.
0307739961|5.0|The last of the trilogy left me yearning for more.  This fast-paced story will find a home on the shelf to be re-read again and again along with my favorites by Robert Ludlum, Dan Brown, Ian Caldwell, and Dustin Thomason.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Though I prefer whetstones, this is a really handy tool for spare kits or even on the go (backpacking, etc.). Works very similar to a kitchen knife sharpener.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|I got this app on the free app of the day feature. I'd all honesty I would've paid foyer the game. Runs smooth on my phone and loads fine every time. The dialogue is a bit childish but still funny.   Controls are great but the flame thrower needs some more cajones. Takes too long for zombies to die.
B002ZG980A|5.0|I stumble upon this movie by accident and was pleasantly surprised. I saw it because I liked Jim Carey as a comedian actor and also because it had a gay romance theme which you hardly see alot of in movies nowadays. I recommend it for everyone because it is a beautiful milestone movie about the depth of love of the human spirit that crosses over sexual boundries.  Delightfully entertaining your first viewing and it was the second viewing when I totally fell in love with the film. This is when you can absorb more of it contents because it is such a beautiful spiritual complex movie. You begin to understand the character's motives for love. How he was living his life as a lie but still succeeded in living it true to himself the way he wanted even though all odds where against him. I give Jim Carey my thanks and praise for having the guts to do this film because most high profile Hollywood actors would be artistically challenged and sexually threathen playing this character. His acting and comedic skills displayed in the film makes it transcend and cross over the sexual boundries that puts all predjuices aside.  I must admit most gay theme movies do almost alway end up in a tragedy but I still feel this movie is a milestone for gay cinema for becoming more into main stream entertainment. Hopefully future gay theme movies will have happier endings that won't always fit the destined tragedy mold. I found it a must for my movie collection.  I believe this movie paves the way for more successful gay theme movie that are thoughly entertaining for all masses. It is a sleeping giant and will speak volumes in the history of gay and mainstream movie cinema.

B004E0Z4XK|5.0|You can replace the soundtrack for scenes in \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" with this album. A sacrilegious statement for any fan of Ennio Morricone but honestly it works which I consider more a testament to how how much love Daniele Luppi and Danger Mouse put into this. Seriously I am going to put a mashup of scenes with the changed score when I get the time.    Needless to say I love this album, but I knew I would before I heard it to take my rating with whatever grains you want.
B0058P7KUA|4.0|Fun game that runs well on Since.  Would recommend to others.  Controls work very well.  One of the more fun games I've played on android.
B000O8OTNC|1.0|I see I am not the only one. Wishing for a 0 star rating. Wish I'd tried them before I tossed the packaging. POS F-
B004OBK4PW|5.0|This is one of the better lesbian movies out there.  The love scenes are awesome; the chemistry between the characters is brilliant.  The movie doesn't end tragically.
B004UXUSIM|5.0|I loved, loved this movie. This is the best Woody Allen film I have seen in awhile. I loved seeing Paris in all it's glory. Owen Wilson was perfect in his role. I could see him agonizing about staying there and living his dream. I have seen this film twice and have recommended it to everyone I talk to. Very romantic and touching. It makes me yearn to go to Paris again. Were I a young girl again this is the city I would love to live in. This film is certainly on my list to purchase and watch again and again.
B002ZG975Q|1.0|I watched this expecting a frothy little film that played on the \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" theme. Instead, I saw this. The two leads have about as much chemistry as a dish of soap and a fork. It wasn't there. Vanessa Hudgens's idea of acting is to make \\"cute\\" faces and stand around staring, trying to look thoughtful or meaningful. There's no explanation of why there's a witch in the school. She's just there and casting spells. Huh? The blind teacher is another loose thread. There he is...but he does nothing except make \\"profound\\" statements every so often. Of course he has to have a happy ending at the end.    This could have been so much better, but the dialogue was cheesy, the acting was bad, and so many things seemed to be thrown in to see what would work. Save your money and rent/buy the Disney version.

0061784788|4.0|I have mixed feelings about this latest Sigma Force adventure... To begin, let me assure anyone out there looking for balls-to-the-wall action adventure that you need look no further than any of James Rollins' novels, this one being no exception.  For my money he is the reigning King of the Thriller who always delivers and seldom disappoints. This plotting, pacing, research and prose in this latest effort are all impeccable and I highly recommend it to old fans and new readers. All that said...<br /><br />I have a few issues with The Devil Colony that keep me from rating it at a solid 5 stars.<br /><br />1.The use of The Book of Mormon as a plot device is disappointing and, at least to me, the dialogue on the subject of Mormonism in general seems a bit contrived and even a preachy at times.<br /><br />2. Another alternate or secret history involving Thomas Jefferson and the Lewis & Clark expedition?! Okay, so it was well done, well researched and well plotted, but none of those factors satisfactorily mitigate adding yet another retelling of Jeffersonian mystique.<br /><br />3. The Masons as bad guys... Okay, fine, the idea is at least digestible here if only barely, but the Knights Templar?! Say it ain't so, James! (If it turns out that you are about to go boldly where no conspiracy theory novelist has gone before, then I apologize in advance. In fact, that is exactly what I hope you are up to, otherwise my previous comments stand!)<br /><br />To repeat, I highly recommend The Devil Colony and will anxiously await the Sigma Force adventure, but at the same time cannot help being a bit disappointed.
0345529057|4.0|I read a number of reviews on this that were negative and almost all of them were for the e-book which had issues and cost more than this.  This set of books, contrary to other reviews I have read is fine mechanically.  All the pages are here so far (halfway through the second book) and the story is quire good so far.  It's told through the perspective of numerous people within the story.  Despite being good, this is no LOTR or Dune, which is why it gets 4 stars.  I.E. great for entertainment purposes, but not really deep or worth a re-read necessarily. Kind of like a Harry Potter, in that regard, but with a very different world setting and is much darker. Worth a read, especially at the price.
B000AP04FG|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites of all time. It is really good and storyline is so original. ESP when two hot actors: Angelina and Brad rock in it! i thought it was going to be an usual chick flick and have a really stupid and confusing plot, but i was pleasantly surprised. i recommend it to anyone who is a brad or angelina fan!

If you choose to upgrade to SM58's in the future,  I assure you that you will Keep your old XM8500's around,  They are just too good to get rid of.  They can be depended on to do their Job, So you can do yours.
031603441X|5.0|Love the Book! This was an honest and truthful \\"Tell All\\" tale about Keith's humble beginnings and the formation of (IMHO) the Greatest Rock N Roll Band of all time. The timeline begins with Keith's early childhood and ends at where he and the Stones are today. The book is loaded with \\"inside information\\" about the love / hate relationship between Keith and Mick Jagger.  Keith is a true \\"Alpha Male\\" and has lived a VERY interesting life. Highly recommend!!
B004WCTLNY|5.0|Just a real surprise of a movie. Don't let the title throw you and watch with your girlfriend or partner, a very straightforward and satisfying story of romance. The difference between this romance and others is the sci-fi connection thriller conjured up by the author of the original 1954 short story, Phillip K Dick.  Philip wrote 121 stories over his lifetime and renowned for film adaptations of his works (including but not limited to) Blade Runner, Minority Report, Paycheck and Total Recall. Late 2011/12 is expected to see Ridley Scott complete (Blade Runner producer and fan of Phillip) the BBC  4 part min drama \\"The Man in the High Castle\\" and even a Disney release of \\"King of Elves\\" is due soon. So get in early and see this first in a wave of adaptations of Phillip's works. With regard to the lead actors Matt Damon and Emily Blunt are perfectly cast not over the top just acting as two real people in love. The Adjustment Bureau team is aptly cast with Terence Stamp and the lesser known but highly talented Anthony Mackie. If you decide to buy the movie get a Blu-Ray  [[ASIN:B004WESFZW The Adjustment Bureau [Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy]]] as the scenes are stunning along with the limited action making use of rain soaked New York streets. On another note, credit must go to director George Nolfi who maintains the integrity of Phillip K Dick's Adjustment Bureau but crafts a pleasant love story not a hard edgy sci fi thriller.
0307595862|2.0|I thought this book was kind of boring and predictable.  Henning Mankell was wonderful because he got inside the head of the lead detective.  The only new thing in this book was that the killer looked like  snowman.  Oh boy!

B002DKGWSO|3.0|Great film it kept me the edge of my couch, but not a film for children it has adult content too strong for children, keep that in mind before buying this film or leaving it laying around your home, but all an all a very entertaining film for a person of the appropriate age, the movie is also a thought provoking because in away the film asks the question what would you do if something of this nature happened to you or someone you loved? I thought all the actors did a great job on this film, and I think it's an underrated film meaning it should have gotten more notoriety then it did    Now for the blu ray quality I felt that the quality of the blu-ray format was not that much better then a standard DVD not saying the format quality was awful just saying that it could have been a little better, but the blu-ray disk was not totally bad though it would have been another plus if audio commentary was included but to my disappointment I could not find any audio commentary options on version I purchased, so if your like me and enjoy audio commentary you wont get that feature on this version but the blu-ray disk is still worth buying but keep in mind that some features are not on this blu-ray version.
0143118706|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert has an unbelievable gift of tapping into the fears, anxieties, hopes and questions of her generation. She uncovers them, researches them, and with her own personal perspective, lays them all out in the open for everyone to see and understand - allowing her generation to feel a little more validated. She sets a new tone, a new way of looking at the biggest questions in life - love, motherhood, marriage, singlehood. Amazing. A great read.

B004EPYZPS|3.0|A train derailment on the outskirts of a small Ohio town unleashes a mysterious creature.  Amid the resulting chaos, a small group of kids (Joel Courtney, Elle Fanning, Riley Griffiths, Ryan Lee, Gabriel Basso, and Zach Mills) have their own little coming-of-age drama.    For the first hour or so, I thought I was watching a 5-star film.  The kids, working on an amateur movie for a local film festival, are hilarious and touching.  Unfortunately, the quality of the film deteriorates as the conventions of the sci-fi action plot assert themselves.  The abilities of the creature are ill-defined; it just seems to be able to do whatever is convenient for the plot.  The naturalistic kids become unconvincing action movie heroes.  In this way, some of the best scenes are derailed even more spectacularly than the freight cars that kick off the whole thing.
B0041KKYEM|2.0|Nobody in this movie IS NORMAL. Portman's character is insane at the VERY least, Nina's mother is WAY over-obsessed with her child...in fact she EVEN undresses her. Her mother gave up her career as a ballerina to have Nina. It appears she is trying to live through Nina and is always smothering her. The people in Nina's life are WAY too creepy and just freaking weird. This whole damn movie felt as if I were drunk. Weird, creepy hallucinations are fun for a short while but done so much you have no idea what's real and what's not. I understand what the writers of this movie were trying to say, but me personally I don't want to view things from a psychotic dancer point of view. What's the deal with porno-type content? Seriously. Do NOT buy this movie, unless you LIKE crazy. Personally, this movie was way TOO hyped up and just doesn't come close to expectations.<br /><br />So from my perspective this gets a 2 out of 5 stars.
B0055FR5PS|5.0|How did this movie get three stars?    This movie was amazing. The honor showed in this movie was epic. It makes you wonder how we would really handle a situation like this - aliens or not. Any tragedy like this can be viewed in the same way - it doesn't have to be science fiction. People forget about katrina, all the tornadoes this year, and of course, the earthquake in Japan. How would you react in a tragedy when the only thing you could do was try to survive?    No matter if this is fake or not, it's makes you think. Anyone of us could be in a tragedy. It takes brave men and women to face it head on without second thoughts. People put their lives on the line all the time in REAL life....but let it involve aliens and people forget the real message behind this movie.     Never back down in the face of tragedy.
B003XRE6UM|1.0|I bought this Kindle edition specifically because it claimed to have all the original illustrations including the maps, plans and copies of documents. This is a false claim; the illustrations are not there. Also the formatting is odd. There are random blank lines between sentences on every page. In addition, the font size keeps changing back and forth from a very large font to a very small font. Finally, there is not even a live table of contents You would be MUCH better off ordering the free edition. Amazon should be ashamed for allowing its name to be associated with such an inferior product.
0439023521|5.0|Being the mother of two school teachers, I'm often called upon to read Young Adult Fiction.  I've read a number of series...Harry Potter, Narnia, Twilight, House of Night, Vampire Academy, Blue Bloods...and, while being entertained, have felt a bit concerned about the violence and sexuality that either creeps into series...after the first book or two...or appears in the opening chapters of the very first installment.    I understand that most of these books are recommended for older audiences, but am upset to find that many of them are being read by my daughters' fourth and fifth grade students.    The Hunger Games is a wonderful book, that I freely recommend.  It has all the criteria...likeable characters, action, plot, believable location, and a bit of romance.      It isn't scary...but it is exciting...it doesn't take place in a confusing \\"time\\" with level upon level of creature development...but does take place in an imagineable, albeit gloomy, future...it isn't overloaded with techno speak and exaggeerated weaponry...but full of pure character and plot development... and it offers up both male and female characters to cheer for...and against. The Hunger Games is just plain old entertaining!    The ending left a bit to be desired...a set up for the next book in the series...but it does stand alone.  I'm hoping the next two books in the trilogy are as easy to recommend!    I caution parents out there to read what their children are reading.  Young Adult can cover a wide range of appropriate ages...and just because a child is within the recommended reading level, or someone else is reading these books, it doesn't mean that your child (or you) are ready for some of the subject matter.    I look forward to Books Two and Three of this series and future offerings from Suzanne Collins.

B0042FZWC0|4.0|The Art of Non-Conformity is short and slightly rambling at times. It contains an important message that I have often lost in my own life - don't do things because other people want you to do them. Do things because you want to do them. Do things that make you happy. Bend the rules. Break the rules. You are not here to fit in. If you are here to fit in how happy does that make you?<br /><br />Guillebeau is an example of someone who works for himself while serving others. He seems to be happy doing what he does. How many of us can really say that? I've often wanted to work for myself writing. After finishing The Art of Non-Conformity I'm motivated to get back to that dream. In fact, based on the author's advice I'm going to cut this review short and get to work right now - read the book if you want to be motivated to pursue your own visionquest.

B00005JPFB|2.0|This movie has a lot to recommend about it. It has a good cast, beautiful sets and imagery, a budget, and an unusual setting. I don't really know any Spanish actors outside of Javier Barden and Antonio Banderas neither of whom are in this, but all of the performances are quite good. Particularly good is Viggo Mortenson who can apparently speak Spanish fluently. Who knew? The budget is really on display here. There are some pretty impressive action scenes. I particularly love the little details like how the Spanish soldiers have to keep their fuses lit since they have to use them to fire their guns. The best part of the movie is undoubtedly the cinematography. The composition and layout of the shots imitate paintings from the period which makes for some beautiful still images.<br /><br />Despite that it's not really a film I can recommend. While it seems to have all the right parts they never really come together properly. For example despite the good performances the characters are utterly undeveloped and change completely without any reason or motivation. I understand that this film is several books combined together and it shows. You can tell exactly when one book ends and another begins. This also means that there's no overarching plot throughout the movie but only a series of smaller incidents. For example, near the beginning of the film Alatriste is hired to kill two men who turn out to be the prince of England and his friend. Once he discovers this they never mention it again. Trying to keep up with what's going on is a constant effort and even when paying attention it is impossible to know why it's happening. What they should have done is pick one of these stories (they cover at least half a dozen) and spend the entire movie on it. By forcing them all together with no links they ruin any dramatic potential inherent in them. Because of this you never really care for (or understand) any of the main characters and you never really get a feel for the important events happening around them.

B004G600A4|5.0|I am a Disney fanatic and this movie has definitely earned it's way to the top of my list.  It has such pizazz and the subtle (and obvious) comedic parts make the movie.  I often think these movies are geared more toward adults, as a lot of the comedy a child would not understand.  Definitely as enjoyable for an adult as it is for a child!

076790382X|5.0|Now, in the words of Monty Python; for something completely different. Having recently read some pretty heavy `hitters' of Autobiography and ecology I reached for something lighter and re-read, for only the sixth or seventh time or so; \\"Bill Returns Home\\" as it were. In 1995 or so, after some 20 years living \\"with my wife's people\\" in England - in deepest, darkest Yorkshire, Bill Bryson returns with his family to his native land.<br /><br />This book is a series of columns he originally wrote for an English audience explaining the culture shocks of pleasures and confusions of his own `coming to America'. Whilst now a little dated - as America descends even deeper into the \\"jaw-slacked\\" adoption of opinions solely from TV `personalities' - the glee with which the author re-discovers his homeland makes for refreshingly humorous reading.<br /><br />Now in my rereading, even knowing what is coming I mentally giggle in anticipation and then laugh aloud at the conclusion of such adventures of `just seeing what this marvelous gadget of a waste disposal unit will do with a..' and his attempt to buy spackle in the half-remembered language and stores of his youth.<br /><br />An uplifting burst of wit.
B00005B36H|4.0|This album is really great. Its cool progressive metal that you can hear anytime very easily. In the beginning i didn't like it so much but after some hearing i loved it. Its an amazing album that anyone who likes metal and especially progressive should buy. Good work.
0749942169|4.0|Afterwards - by Rosamund Lupton  Afterwards is Rosamund Lupton second novel following on from the amazing success of Sister. The story starts on a normal day at a school where families are joined together to enjoy the Sports day for the Pupils at Sidley House.    Everything changes in particular for one family, the Covey Family, when black smoke suddenly escapes from the school into the sky. Grace the Mother not seeing her daughter Jenny stood with her son, runs into the fire to try to find her.    Grace recites the story of what happens next and the struggle that she as a Mother has trying to identify who was the arsonist and to save her daughter. Nothing is that simple though with many limitations in front of her.    I guess I expected a lot from this second novel as I thought Sister was a fantastic story. I did find myself trying to second guess what was going to happen and look for hidden plots because of it! You will not be disappointed by Afterwards. It is packed full of emotion and love of a family and the length any Mother will go to protect her Child. I was concerned that I would struggle to understand the situation that Grace was in whilst re-counting the story but it is very cleverly written that you believe it is possible and the part comes second to the story.    Can you really trust everyone that you hold dear to you and are first impressions really what they seem?    A \\"whodunit\\" / tense suspense thriller all wrapped into one. As with Sister, Rosamund leaves you with an amazing ending.
B0055FR5PS|4.0|This movie is like a cross of Independence Day and Black Hawk Down.  The movie follows a team of marines and is filmed from a military prospective.  After aliens invade earth and begin killing humans a team of marines is send out to extract a pocket of civilians.  While there is plenty of action, shooting and explotions, the movie also shows the emotional side of soldiers dealing with war and its effects.  It did not bother me that the movie did not go into more back story on the aliens, but I did find it refreshing to see a movie in which the honor and bravery of our military in combat is displayed.  Something I have not seen in a while.  It was a good old bad aliens invading earth and wanting to kill all humans movie with the humans winning in the end.  It did not seem to have any heavy handed political, environmental undertone that was painfully obvious in Avatar, which ruined that movie for me.  If you like action and sci fi, go for it.  If you are looking for some great story line and drama find some independent, subtitled movie.

B001GCUO5M|4.0|I didn't know too much about this movie going into it and I found it to be a pretty good movie. You follow the main character(DiCaprio) around on Shutter Island which has a hospital on it, while he is trying to solve a crime. He's going through a great deal of torment related to his personal life while trying to figure what exactly is going on at this hospital and when you get to the end of the movie you discover its not at all what it seems. Unless you are one of those people that is great at figuring out movie plot twists. I'm pretty good but I was pleasantly surprised with this one.
1594744769|5.0|From the first page, I was hooked by this book.  The writing is descriptive and interesting, and draws the reader in to a gripping, poignant and unforgettable saga.  The vintage photos of truly peculiar children only add to the fantasy and fun-house aspect of the book.  I hope this author has another book in the works.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|My husband really enjoys watching this DVD.  We like  the MacGyver series and we don't have Cable or Satalite so this comes in handy.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|First of all, The West Wing is still one of, if not the, best shows ever made. That alone should give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Secondly, this set is a must have for anyone who loves The West Wing. Other reviews here say that you scratch the dvds getting them in and out of their cardboard/folder sleeves, but just be careful, and you'll be fine. I don't know what the fuss is about.<br /><br />Every season (1-4 plus the bad ones after that) are all lined up in a convenient place, and the set just plain looks awesome. Take the leap and spend the money, you'll be happy.
0345529057|5.0|This series is incredible.  I'm a bit ashamed that I had never heard of it prior to HBO's adaptation that aired this year but I am so glad that I found it.  Thanks to GRRM's genius writing, these books read themselves.  As a slow reader I was astonished to get through all four books in little more than 6 weeks.  I found myself reading during every spare minute in the day and crushed when I got to the end of Feast for Crows and realized there would be almost 3 weeks between that day and when I could start Dance with Dragons.
0316098329|5.0|I love stories written where the narrator is a child.  It takes an accomplished author to tell a story from their perspective and be able to hold on to their honesty and innocence.  This story is haunting and the characters are ones that I will remember for a long time.  I can not wait to read Jaycee Duggards book now.  This book is amazing!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I'll start off by using the word so many have used: these books are undeniably haunting; however, despite the themes and imagery explored and used, I found myself not calling it \\"dark\\" fiction.  Lately, so many books seem light and fluffy at first but then delve deeper...and deeper...and deeper...until they get dark and torturous/creepy/frightening (see Brandon Mull's A WORLD WITHOUT HEROES).    THE HUNGER GAMES, despite not even starting light and fluffy, and despite delving, did not reach \\"dark\\" fiction.  (As I'm writing this, I can't actually find my copy of THE HUNGER GAMES, so it's been a while since I read it).  When I read fiction like this, my brain tends to \\"filter out\\" most of the blood/gore, but I found myself, despite the images used (which are not for the squeamish), not needing to do this.  And nothing inappropriate, which makes me glad.    The author also wove a masterful and compelling story, although I must confess the ending left a tad to be desired.  These books by Collins are, I have to say, inferior to THE UNDERLAND CHRONICLES, which I adored, but they still deserve five stars.    All in all, THE HUNGER GAMES were some of the best books I've read.

0385338910|2.0|Having read and enjoyed this author's latest book, This Is Where I Leave You, I picked up this earlier Tropper novel. The protagonist - our widower - is 29 year old Doug Parker, a somewhat likeable ne'er do well, who is a year into grieving the tragic death of his wife. Doug is not handling his loss well, wallowing in self-pity, (and booze), and barely paying attention. The reader spends a lot of time inside Doug's head - actually too much - co-basting in his grief, privy to his happy memories and given a front row seat to his sexual fantasies.    In the real world, Doug has a teenage stepson - the dearly departed Mrs. Parker was 11 years older than her hubby - who shares both Doug's loss and his emotional maturity level. Doug's comedic dysfunctional family is very concerned about him and in their own special way decides to help him out of his funk. This is all very reminiscent of This Is Where I Leave You. In fact this novel reads like an unpolished earlier version of that book and unfortunately, is nowhere near as entertaining.    The specific differences between the two stories are superficial, otherwise the books' plots, characters, family dynamics and even the dialog are very, very much the same. Both read like screenplays - again for the same movie - but with the Widower's protagonist less likeable; the \\"flow\\" less even and the \\"jokes\\" less funny. (The silly fairy tale ending to Widower doesn't help either.)     So my suggestion - skip this book and read the finished product, This Is Where I Leave You.
B001R10BM8|1.0|Let me preface this review by saying that I love the James Bond series and that I think that Sean Connery is the best of the \\"Bonds\\", but this movie stinks. It is by far the worst of all of the 007 movies made. The story is of course not original, it is a remake of the fantastic \\"Thunderball\\" movie, so there is nothing unique or intriguing about it.  The quality of the movie is awful, in large part because there was no budget. Sean's $1 Million dollar (1st of it's time) contract used up alot of the movie budget.  The special effects were hoakie, there was no chemistry between Kim Bassinger and Sean (She called him old in a Playboy interview, not a good start), the music was not memorable, and Sean's toupe was hiddeous. I would avoid this movie, because if you haven't seen it, you will be very disappointed and even upset if you purchased it.

B000088E6D|4.0|I very much enjoyed this CD, MB's debut.  Every song is enjoyable and I was able to let the CD play in my car over and over without skipping around.  I especially liked \\"Moondance\\", \\"Sway\\" and \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\", the latter of which is a bossa version which is very cool.  MB is the most recent in a long line of crooners in the mold of Sinatra, Como, Martin, Bennet, Darin, Connick Jr., et al.  He does a really good job with the classic swing repertoire and even does some new arrangements but he also updates the Great American Songbook with tunes from the rock and soul genres, which is most welcome.

B003Y38YFS|4.0|I just read one of the reviews here where the woman can't wear the shoes at all because of the discomfort the thong causes between her toes.  I've only had this discomfort occur when I have been using these shoes an awful lot.  However, it does occur with prolonged use so that is the one negative you might want to keep in mind.<br /><br />Everything else I have to say is positive.  The shoes are attractive, comfortable, can be worn everywhere, including to and in the pool. ( I have actually used them for water jogging and they worked just fine.) Because of the back of the shoe, these hold your foot in place much better than the backless versions.  Usually my feet are coming out of this type of show but with these my feet never move.<br /><br />Due to the crosslite material in the shoe construction, the shoes are at once very lightweight yet also very sturdy and good for your feet.  Even if this shoe does not appeal to you, the Crocs shoe line is excellent, colorful, stylish, good for your feet and affordable. There is a Crocs etail outlet online which gives you an even wider selection of the shoes.  This is my 4th set of Croc shoes and you too will become an addict once you get your first set.<br /><br />I have this shoe in the much more attractive orange and white color plus they are currently on sale at that crocs etail outlet I mentioned.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|great game played it on my droid 2, wont even load on my droid 3. hopefully they put out an update.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I tried this game on Xbox Live and loved it - when I saw it for $1.49 here I decided to jump on it. I installed it on my LG Optimus and it runs great. The only caveat is that installation on your phone takes up 70MB or so, and startup takes a bit. Other than that though there's nothing really to say; if you like puzzle/strategy games with high replay value then buy this. This beats Angry Birds in my opinion - Angry Birds gets points though because it is FREE.

159562015X|2.0|I got this book on a recommendation of a friend- and after reading the introduction I realized it was yet another hokey self-help book. I thought I'd take the test anyways, but my initial assumption was correct. The test is described in such a way as to make it seem objective, but it's just as accurate as reading the descriptions in the book yourself and figuring it out. For example, you're asked questions like \\"I work hard to include others.\\" Well, if you know yourself well enough to answer that question, then there's no need to take the test. You have only 20 seconds to answer each question, but most infuriatingly, you cannot go back and change an answer if you accidentally clicked the wrong one. And of course you can't take the test over again.   Also, there's no real guidance on what to do after you know what your strengths are. There are no suggested careers, which would probably be the most useful to the people taking the test. One piece of advice given for the \\"Input\\" strength is \\"Don't be afraid to position yourself as an expert.\\" Thanks, Strengthsfinder. I'm sure I'll use that for the rest of my life.

When told of a way to bring him back the family will risk everything to get thier son back.  Let me start by saying I am not scared very easy at all in movies.  I can count on one hand the movies that have actually scared me. Saying that the ones that have scared me include \\"Poltergeist\\", \\"Paranormal Activity 1\\" and \\" The Exorcism Of Emily Rose\\".  I say that to tell you that this movie is a lot like those three put together.  Which is why this is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen.  Take that statement as you will, but this movie had me sitting up with the lights on for almost the entire time.  I'm actually a little surprised that this movie is only PG-13, but that just shows how desensitized we are getting to horror.  One of the best things this movie has going for it is that it is scary without being gory.  This movie creeped the hell out of me, and I loved every minute of it.  Overall, I would call this \\"Paranormal Activity\\" meets \\"Poltergeist\\" mixed with \\"What Dreams May Come\\", with a dash of whatever will make you scream.  Watch this, but not alone.  I give it an A-.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - Mabye, but not soon.<br /><br />*Also try - Paranormal Activity 1 & 2 & Poltergeist

B001AQO3QA|5.0|I know that there is a scare with the blu-ray players being able to play these disks, I have a vizio blu-ray player and although it takes it 30 seconds more or so to load the disk, it eventually plays fine and all is well. If you're looking into this product, I'd be sure to know your blu-ray player inside and out. Otherwise, the movies look great. I really noticed an improvement on the first disk and it really brings all the other movies along with it. I got mine for $42.00 through a 3rd party dealer here on amazon and I'm really enjoying it. If you want to buy, go for the $42 one before you pay $95 bucks.

Another thing I loved is, it is set in a real place...I grew up on Long Island although I never found out anything about Plum Island but I certainly did after I read the book.    I love all DeMille's books..which is good and bad.  Bad because I never get anything else done and good because I am thoroughly entertained!

I glanced through reviews, careful not too read too much in case of spoilers and I recommend that. Good acting and suspense. Wished I caught it on the big screen. Appreciate that movies can be rented through Amazon now. Duncan Jones is now one of my favorite directors. He's one to watch as I also enjoyed his movie \\"Moon\\".

0345522478|5.0|I absolutely loved reading this book because it was so obvious that the author absolutely loved writing it.<br /><br />Atticus O'Sullivan was such a well balanced character with his 2100 years of wisdom and his firm understanding of the way to stay hidden in today's modern world.  I was amazed.  It almost made me wonder if such old souls actually might be living among us and I have simply never noticed.  The addition of Oberon the Irish wolfhound gave Atticus the chances he needed to be warm and loving which gave him an advantage over many of the urban fantasy characters I encounter.  The method of showing the thoughts of Oberon was also very cleverly done so that I always knew immediately when the dog's thoughts were being stated without any confusion.  The Irish legends, Celtic legends, Nordic legends, all were wonderfully explained and incorporated into the story without making my eyes glaze over from boredom.  That's quite a feat right there!  Also, Kevin Hearne didn't feel bound by traditional depictions of Atticus as a Druid or Hal as a werewolf or Leif as a vampire or the witches on both sides of the good vs evil spectrum.  He managed to make each type of character his own and gave them the characteristics he wanted them to have and made them believable for the story.  For those readers who enjoy the action aspects of urban fantasy novels rest assured those elements are found here.  But also found are times when the backstory is being filled in so the pace slows down for that information to be revealed.<br /><br />I never got bored.  I really enjoyed the characters of Atticus and Oberon so that I'm ready to move on to read the next book in the series ([[ASIN:0345522494 Hexed: The Iron Druid Chronicles]]).  I really appreciated the author's sense of humor, his descriptions of the action and sword sequences and how he had Atticus interact with all different age levels of characters because the widow Mrs. MacDonagh is superb.  In short, I think it was wonderful.

BUT...I was so happy that I downloaded Beautiful Disaster.  From the first page up until the very last word, Jamie McQuire is able to captivate her audience with every word.  I could not put my Kindle down and when I had to, I was looking for every excuse to pick it back up so I could continue to read it.  The relationship that McGuire gives to Abby and Travis is real, valuable, and fun loving.....I actually laughed out loud a couple of times when I was reading the book....which I hardly ever do.  Believe me when I say that if you love McGuire's \\"Providence\\" series, you will be in love with Beutiful Disaster....trust me, I have read it three times in two weeks....

I had read complaints about latency issues and delay between key press and response from software, but I had no such problem. If you encounter this problem, it is most likely your drivers that are the cause. Use ASIO4All drivers, and there should be little to no latency. The buttons are firm and make a distinct click noise when pressed. The keys themselves are light, but they still allow for pressure sensitivity.

The guy was supposedly born in 1964 (as seen in his passport in the movie).  Liam is just a little too seasoned at nearly 60, to be playing this guy.
B0058S0OMS|5.0|In my opinion, Halloween 2 is one of the best horror movie sequals of all time.  It is scary, suspenseful, melodic, and creepy.  Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance are both back for this one, that takes place directly after the first Halloween.  Michael Myers continues to hunt Laurie, as Dr. Loomis finds out a very disturbing secrect about Michael's connection to Laurie.  This has never really gotten a proper DVD release, and I'm so happy that it's finally coming to blu ray.  Any new transfer of the movie has to be better than what's out there now.  So, if you've never seen Halloween 1 and 2, or if your a big fan, then buy the blu ray's because everone's entitled to one good scare.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Bought this book as a read for our vacation.  I didn't take any other books with me, because I thought It would take me forever to finish as this isn't really my style book.  Needless to say, I was done with it by day 2.  It was sooo good!  I could not put it down!  Great price too!  Great Job Jamie!  Another Amazing book!
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This was pretty awesome. I can genuinely say that this was the only musical i could ever bear to sit through, and really, the songs stay with you for some time after.<br />Neil Patrick Harris and Nathan Fillion are awesome as Doctor Horrible and Captain Hammer. Felicia Day is great as the love interest. The hundreds of previous reviews have said it all ad nausea, but i just wanted to add my affirmation to this purchase. You cant help but love it.
B003VWU2WA|3.0|i'm reviewing this in the context of Mac OSX 10.5 ( Leopard);  I purchased it to control a software defined radio (SDR) application. I had moderate success.<br /><br />The drivers, which must be downloaded from Griffen's website, are extremely simplistic; they provide almost no flexibility within the context of any one application; also, there is no way to direct the knob's output to an app that isn't currently the active app. The drivers installed easily, and did not require a reboot (thank you!)<br /><br />I contacted Griffen support, and received a reply three days later which provided no useful information.  I wrote them back, it's been four days so far and no response --  I consider this unacceptable.<br /><br />Having said that, the hardware is really nice, and perhaps someone will come up with third party software to take this device nearer to its full potential. I have requested the source code for the driver and if this is made available to me, I will provide significantly enhanced functionality. Watch this review to see if Griffen steps up to the plate.<br /><br />Until then be aware that the knob can only control two parameters which are always fed to the currently active application or to the OS if no application is recognized, and these parameters cannot be changed without actually editing the system preferences. There is zero provision for feedback to the knob or the LED from applications.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Pros:   Fantastic Sound Quality  Excellent Transmision Range (I had family follow me in a different car on a highway and listen to my music)  No Batteries Required  Very Good Build Quality  SD, USB Flash, AUX IN/OUT Compatability  Remote  Any FM Station Selection  Ability to Bookmark Podcasts    Cons:  Sound is 30% quieter vs. the CD or Radio in the car  No way to separate folders for shuffle mode (at least I haven't found one)  Sometimes not the full song name is displayed (but shouldn't be looking at song names while driving anyway)  No auto-bookmark ability (if you start a song and turn off the car, next time you start up the car, song will start from the beginning unless you manually bookmark, which sometimes I forget to do)    Bottom Line: Best purchase I have made for my car since I bought it. I have tried several radio transmitters before, this is by far the best out there.

B004LWZW24|5.0|i'm a hard critic when it comes to scary movies. I dont scare easily.. but this really scared me. the reason being is.. because.. when i was a kid i actually had dreams like this. out of body experiences all the time.. people dont think it exists.. but it really does. Also the part that really scared me (being raised as a catholic) were the demons ... any kind of movie that has that kind of aspect where it has anything to do with your soul or with spirits, or demons trying to take over your body just gives the freaking creeps. but wow this movie.. very well done. i actually was scared. :)
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|Ok, I'm late...I read this one first. Even though  I found her shallow, I really liked Darcy. I didnt even realize at first that I wasnt getting Rachel's POV. I went on to read Something Borrowed aftewards. I found that I simply could not stand Rachel. This character proved to be a self righteous, spineless chick. She secretly resented Darcy for going after what she wanted and for herself not having the chutzpah to do the same. She used Darcy's \\"lifelong selfishness\\" to justify her low-life betrayal. Aside from Darcy stealing her 5th grade boyfriend and lying about getting in Notre Dame there was nothing significant that she did. Ok, yes she slept with Marcus. Rachel had no interest in Marcus, and it simply cannot begin to compare to sleeping with a fiance. Rachel was the selfish one at the end of the day. I liked that even Ethan who was so down on Darcy in Something Borrowed ended up loving Darcy. So, while it seems most are Team Rachel and glad that she ended up with Dex. I am Team Darcy and happy she came out on top! All in all, I liked both of the books but this was the best by far.

B00544L9EI|5.0|Every once in a while there's an artist that transcends their respective genre to obtain mass appeal with listeners no matter what their preferred genre is. Eminem is one of those artists.<br /><br />What we have with Bad Meets Evil (Eminem and Royce da 5'9\\") is two MCs at the top of their game. Eminem's rhymes are tighter and more complex than ever before and Royce proves, song after song, that he deserves his spot on this CD. The energy these two exude throughout the CD is amazing and the way they feed off of each others rhymes, seemingly blatantly trying to outdo one another, makes Hell: The Sequel a CD that is easy to come back to over and over.<br /><br />Eminem's Recovery, was for the most part, pretty serious. And rightfully so, he had a lot of demons to exercise and a lot of explaining to do. Now that he's done that, he's the classic Eminem once again. No one is safe on Hell: The Sequel. What I love so much about this CD is that Eminem and Royce sound so intense throughout so it gets your adrenaline pumping but when you actually listen to the lyrics they cover so many topics. From inspirational topics like not backing down, to funny rhymes about their manhood, its not just in your face hardcore topics. Not to mention that every single beat is on point and powerful.<br /><br />With this being an EP we don't get a full CDs worth of music. With the delux edition we get 11 tracks (two of which are bonuses). Out of those 11 tracks, I only skip one, Loud Noises. Don't get me wrong, it's a good song and Slaughterhouse tears it up, but I just have a hard time getting into it is all. As for the best songs, Welcome 2 Hell is an incredibly powerful opener that gears you up properly for what is to come, Fastlane sees Em and Royce feeding off of each other beautifully like I stated earlier, Above The Law sees one of Em's best verses of the CD, I'm On Everything pounds, and Lighters sees Bruno Mars belting out an emotional chorus while Em and Royce slow things down.<br /><br />I want to single out Take From Me especially. As a music lover it kills me when I see or hear about people illegally downloading music. This song, all around, is the most powerful thing either artist has been a part of for some time. Royce's verse is unapologetically harsh which plays into Em's career defining verse perfectly. Listen to the lyrics and actually HEAR where these two are coming from.<br /><br />All in all, Hell: The Sequel is far and away everything and more than I expected. For rap lovers, Eminem fans, or curious listeners, every one should take the time to give this CD an honest spin. I firmly believe that everyone can find something enjoyable in it. Highly recommended.From Me especially. As a music lover it kills me when I see or hear about people illegally downloading music.

B0000630BT|5.0|Painkiller is the best Judas Priest album ever and I rate it up there with all of the best in heavy metal music.  The reason I rate it like this is because when I listen to heavy metal music I want it to give me that feeling.  You know the one where you feel like taking a Thrusting Bastard sword onto the battle field and gutting the enemy.  Painkiller gives me that feeling.  This is why I rate it up there with all of the best in heavy metal music.
0321344758|5.0|This is maybe the best ever book about making web pages that has ever been written.  I think I found my copy in a remainder pile.  It's just over 200 pages and I found it fun to read.<br /><br />It won't tell you about how to make a web page; instead, it speaks about what NOT to put on a web page.<br /><br />Web pages they frustrate me.  My bank should hire Steve Krug.  So should the government and all those businesses who want our money and pretend to service us with their web pages without really giving us any service at all.  Often you'd think they are spy agencies who do not want you to know their phone numbers and addresses.<br /><br />\\"Don't Make Me Think\\" in a nutshell says do not put so many words on a web page that I can not find what I'm after.  It really means that if you design your web pages well enough I'll have more time to think about whatever it is that I came to your web page to discover.  Instead, badly designed web pages frustrate me so much that even if I find what I was looking for, by the time I find it, I sometimes forget why I wanted it in the first place or I'm so put off that I don't care anymore.<br /><br />People like you and I should read Steve Krug's book and then demand simple, thoughtful, easy to use web pages from our banks, governments, et cetera.  Google won the search engine war, or at least my vote, because Google lets me find stuff I want without frustrating me.<br /><br />You can read a chapter for free at his web site sensible.com.  It's worth you time.<br /><br />If I were to start a new career as a web designer, I'd probably reread \\"Don't Make Me Think\\" before and after every web site I'd design.  Steve Krug says if you can't afford a person like him to help you, at least get people like you grandmother to try to use your web site; if they can't use it, then people like you and I won't want to use it either.
B003Y5H556|1.0|Short and sweet should have read the back ground info closer the connection to Twilight would have sent me running, was looking for a good scary movie on and old theme got pale teenagers insted, to be fair I'm not a teenage girl so my pespective is not the demographic the film was aimed at.
0439023513|3.0|Without a doubt the first 2 books in this series were awesome, and as with any trilogy the final chapter is usually the worst (See: Matrix, Spiderman, every damn trilogy). I felt this book is a good read just to close out the series, but the book could have been at least 50 pages shorter. The end seemed to drag on for me, and I actually had a hard time finishing it. The only thing that kept me going was to get some closure on the story. The book started out very promising, but the author could have easily cut this book shorter and made it a lot better near the middle to end.    Overall, read it to close out the series, but just be warned that its a disappointing letdown compared to the first two.

B000FC11A6|5.0|\\"Cryptonomicon\\" is long, very long but in that wonderful page turner way.<br /><br />It covers multiple decades and some terrific heros such as a marine, a Japanese warrior, and a computer genius. All are heroes in their own ways.<br /><br />I do not want to give too much away.  There's war in the Pacific and Europe and there's our current vulnerabity to computer hackers.  WikiLeaks did not exist when Cryptonomicon was written AFAIK but one can see a definite kinship with Julian Assange and the computer genuis character.<br /><br />Author Neal Stephenson has written a tale that is equally enjoyable by computer geeks and grandmothers.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I am still waiting for the movie version.  Richard Donner is the type of superman who could produce and direct it if his health is holding up in his octogenarian years.  Jsmes Cameron could also do a fantasitc job and would not even need 3D.

B001AQT0OU|4.0|Stanley Kubrick's film Barry Lyndon is viewed by some as a slow, boring piece of work. But when you watch it via Blu-ray, on a decent size screen, the beautifully designed and photographed images of a past long gone spring vividly to life. In fact, it's almost like going back in a time machine. I don't think it's one of Kubrick's best films, but even his lesser works are better than most of the drivel that's shown in the cinemas today. This movie's exquisite images are a wonder to behold on Blu-ray. In my opinion, it's the next  best thing to watching a brand new 35m print on screen in a well equipped cinema.
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|I heard about Battle Royale a long time ago but as the years went on it disappeared from my mind. I happened to see it on Amazon and was instantly putting it in my cart. I didn't know what to expect apart from the general synopsis of the movie, so I went in unprepared. The movie completely blew me away. And it wasn't just for the original concept of school friends fighting to the death and the gory deaths. The best part is the emotional toll it takes on its characters, and how each classmate reacts to their participation in the contest. It's what transcends Battle Royale from a simple action flick to the cult classic it is today. Highly recommended to movie goers looking for something different or just looking to be entertained.
B004EPZ084|4.0|Horrible Bosses is a revenge fantasy on acid or better yet, a snort of cocaine. It's obscene. It's politically incorrect. It's boorish and absolutely hilarious. Everyone seems to have having a good time, especially the horrible bosses played by Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston and Colin Farrell. Colin Farrell seems to be channeling Tom Cruise's performance from Tropic Thunder. He's completely unrecognizable as the kung fu obsessed tool of a boss, Bobby Pellit. Of course, no one does smarm better than Kevin Spacey. He's played this type of role before but never with so much glee. As for Jennifer Aniston, she is fabulous as the nymphomaniac dentist who lusts after her hygienist.     The premise is very simple. Three under paid, under appreciated and over worked employees played by Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day decide that if they want their lives to improve, they need to murder their bosses. Thus begins the clever and very rude homage to Alfred Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train as well as Throw Mama From the Train.     It's an intelligent, witty and extremely well written movie. What made it more fun were unexpected cameos by Ioan Gruffudd and Bob Newhart. Ioan Gruffudd's scene as a potential assassin for hire is a riot.     This movie was a pleasant surprize.
0345528581|5.0|I shopped around for a bodyweight conditioning book for a while.  I'd read a competitor, but it mostly had uninspired and limited exercises with a goofy notion about progression.  This book succeeded admirably where others failed.<br /><br />Lauren fills his book with a wide variety of exercises, some familiar, some exotic.  Granted, you need to use some equipment for some of the exercises, but you won't need to go hunting for anything too outlandish.<br /><br />He suggests several programs and workouts early on, but the real meat of the book is in the turn-key programs.  They might look easy, but they can certainly take the wind out of your sails.  The best part about all of these, though, is their scalability;  this book can be done by anyone, regardless of fitness level.  It's all just a matter of finding the right exercises.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|The Hunger Games is an engaging story. However, the characters are poorly developed and the actual writing is mediocre at best.
0061990477|3.0|This is a stupid story.  It is all full of `woe is me, my life is so bad, but it can be so beautiful, but still, woe is me.'  Fiona is married to Paddy Cleary.  They live on a place in New Zeeland with five or six kids.  They struggle to make ends meet, yet there is an agreement that this is what life is to be for them.  The suffering is terrible but it can be shouldered and no one is getting anything more than anyone else.  Their daughter, Megham, is doted on, as an only daughter is, but only a little because there is no money or energy to waste.  Then along comes Paddy's sister, Mary.  She invites them to come to her place in New South Wales, Australia.  Paddy can be her head stockman and the rest of the family can help accordingly.  Being Irish, they are Catholic and the priest is ever present.  He meets Paddy's family at the train station, helps them get settled in their new home, etc.  Mary dies and the Cleary's inherit, sort of, her place.  And the rest happens.   This is a romance novel, but it is also a book of Australia and the years of 1920 to 1970.  The story may be stupid, but the descriptions of Australian life and of the war years is really something I have not seen enough of and that was interesting,   The characters are interesting enough, but to my mind seem to get stuck in muddles and strive to get beyond or above them, but can not.  They are who they are and that is all they will ever be.  The romance is so overwhelming that the people are powerless to do anything about it.  The women are very perceptive and the men are basically sticks in the mud unable to see what is right in front of them.  In fact the men are such that homosexuality is right around the corner from what they are.  It is one of the perceptions that the women make that the men would not need them at all except for not being homosexuals, so they need sex with women, or for childrearing.  Maybe this is why there has been such a general ban on homosexuality throughout history - toensure the heterosexuality of men.
B00065MDSQ|5.0|Hands down this is my favorite album, ever. I first heard it as a freshman in college. I was obsessed with Led Zeppelin and read some book on popular music that suggested that Fripp was better. Well I just had to find out, and so I borrowed someone's \\"Compact King Crimson.\\" It wasn't long before Sir Robert displaced Jimmy Page (and pretty much everyone else) in my pantheon of guitar greats. Initially the band befuddled me because its sound really changed massively over the years and I was seeing it retrospectively, but I grabbed onto Red real fast. I can appreciate all of it (well maybe not Pete Sinfield's worst excesses), but the Wetton/Bruford years are the high point of the band.     Red is a tough album. It's definitely not for everyone and there really aren't any light points. The recording is amazing, aggressive, dialed to the roof. I love Fripp's production here, too. Unlike the '80s material, it doesn't suffer from some of that decade's production monstrosities (gated reverb or flangers everywhere, anyone?) and Fripp didn't make things sound claustrophobic either, which he sometimes did with his audio verite style. Instead the material breathes... like a big blazing bonfire, but it breathes. Wetton is all distorted menace on the bass and puts in a decent vocal performance (but Crim's never been a real vocal band), Bruford beats his drums like they owe him money and sounds very natural doing it. The guest players (Marc Charig, Mel Collins and Ian McDonald) put in some really fantastic wind and brass work, which is pretty interesting given how unlikely a combination that is over ripping distorted electric guitar and bass.     The compositions are bleak, there's no doubt about it, culminating in the sorrowful intensity of what I think is basically Crim's masterpiece, Starless. Everything is on display, the mellotron intro with the twisted whole tone melody, with the middle build to the monster sax solos, Fripp's totally out of control en fuego solo, and then the reprise of the theme as an instrumental on the way out, which Fripp has the gonads not to fade, but lets die naturally. Wow. (The other tracks are pretty good, too.) My only real regret is that there aren't good live versions of this material done with this band. Crim is always better live and this stuff would have absolutely BURNED DOWN THE HOUSE. If you are a progressive rock fan, why don't you own it already? If you want to know what Crim is all about, start here. (And for a very different view of the songs, be sure to check out Crimson Jazz Trio.)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I finally broke down and bought this book after hearing so much about it and the movies coming out.  I was not disappointed one bit.  I couldn't stop reading!!! The whole premise is a little disturbing but you can't help but be drawn into this world the author creates.  The main characters Katniss and Peeta are wonderful and your heart goes out to them for what they have to go through.  I can't wait to see these characters come to life on the big screen...hopefully, they won't botch it up!  I just downloaded book 2 a few hours ago and can't wait to get started!

0307716511|4.0|I liked the first half of the book. Very suspenseful and well written. I found myself relating very well to the main character because I have a younger sister. Their stories were very much the same of how we grew up. About the time of Tess's funeral, I began to loose interest. The details became too excessive and mundane. It was also around the middle of the book that I figured out who the killer was. Never once did I waiver from my assumption, and I was correct in the end. I do not like books that I can so readily \\"figure out.\\" However, there is another twist at the end that I did not see coming. It is because of this twist that I gave the book 4 stars, rather then 3. As I said before, the book was great for the first half. I began to lose interest at the point that they buried Tess and the baby.
0007274939|5.0|When I was a boy, one of my favorite books was \\"The Boy Scout Handbook,\\" which I devoured even though I wasn't yet a Boy Scout.  It offered all kinds of tips and ideas and counsel for living in the outdoors and experiencing various adventures.<br /><br />Wiseman's text is, in many ways, the same book rewritten for adults.  I find it a great book to noodle through in the same way I did when I was a kid.  I pick it up often and read pieces of it at random.  I suppose that as a 50-something I'm the same I was as a kid, and I hope that's a good thing.<br /><br />That said, the book is of great practical import.  I can confirm that the advice Wiseman gives here is spot on.  I'm not just a former Boy Scout, but a former U.S. Army infantry officer who earned a Ranger tab and did all kinds of training in extreme environments (jungle, arctic, desert and so on).  His survival instructions are clear and incisive, from how to put together a survival kit and how to plan an expedition to how to keep one's head together (perhaps the best survival advice at all).<br /><br />I would add that he is a superb writer, at least for this task.  His prose is clear, strong, and direct; nary a word is wasted.  Illustrations and blocking are superbly done.<br /><br />In this day of terrorism and increasing risk of natural disaster, every household should own and study a book like this one and prepare appropriately.  That is, everyone should prepare a bug-out bag that includes this text.  I've certainly followed its advice by assembling a disaster-preparedness kit and plan for my family.

B0026SCMNM|4.0|This book grabbed me and would not let me go until I stayed up well into the night and gave it every second I could spare for two days running until I finished it. Even then, it had a hold on me...I re-read most of it for a couple of days afterwards. Eilis' experiences as a young immigrant and the exquisite dilemma she faces when her new and old worlds collide are written with great care and insight. Frankly, I am still a bit amazed at a male author's ability to create such a believable, complex female character. It reads like a memoir - \\"Brooklyn\\" is one of those books that will remain in my permanent personal book collection - never to be given away. You will be VERY glad you decided to read this engaging and memorable story.
4770031246|5.0|I have always loved Japanese things. Their toys, their food, their culture, their language, everything held a certain charm for me. So upon landing my first post-college job and moving out of my parents' house and in with my already employed boyfriend, my first order of business was experimenting with Japanese foods, particularly in my attempts to get my boyfriend and myself to both eat better and stop going out to lunch so often to save money.<br /><br />This book has been a godsend. Not only does it clearly explain each and every step of the preparation, it has a multitude of tips and advice for simplifying the preparation process. I just finished making a batch of rice for the coming week in fact, and have some Miso Marinated eggs sitting in the fridge, some salted salmon frozen and ready to go for Tuesday's lunch or something, and plenty of ingredients to whip up whatever I want to try for lunch. The best part is that it is super easy to expand upon the recipes; it takes no more effort to make enough for my lunch and my boyfriend's as well, and so we both get to enjoy delicious lunches freshly made every morning. In fact, his coworkers can't believe I manage to come up with new dishes and have the time to cook them every morning fresh! Guess I'd better keep this book a secret. ;)<br /><br />The best part of the book has to be the suggestions for variations after every single recipe. The variations allow for so much creativity and mixing and matching so you will never get bored or used to a dish. The recipes are very simple to make, and always have turned out scrumptious. Limiting myself to bento boxes for lunch has also helped me manage my low blood sugar--I make sure to pack plenty of filler vegetables, and my blood sugar has yet to be a problem!<br /><br />This was a wonderful investment, and I would highly recommend it for anyone who is looking to spice up their lunch routine. You don't need a fancy bento box; I pack my boyfriend's into a largeish tupperware, and it is just as good as my bento box. Don't hesitate to purchase this book, and make sure to check out the website as well for even more ideas and recipes!and it is just as good as my bento box.

0060196122|3.0|Half way through the book I figured out how it was going to end, but it was a clever ending and an easy fast read.
0307341550|3.0|The book itself is interesting to a point. I liked the way that the characters were described and how there was not an abundance of them. I had a easy time keep track of who was doing what, and who should be a suspect. The book was an easy read, and it had a lot of reasons for me to keep coming back to it.    I think this is an average novel because the main twist in the plot has done before. Sadly for me, I read a book by Agatha Christie and it had a lot of similarities in terms of the twist which I will not spoil. That brought it down to a 4/5 stars for me. This is simply because I new the twist, and when it was revealed it was not news to me.    The reason I am giving it a 3/5 is because of a certain misleading information. There is a point in the story where the author states a medical fact which is true. However, to a reader not well versed in medical science I had no that there could be an exception to the rule which would have led me to actually guess correctly on the murderer.    If you have not read this one Agatha Christie book before (sorry the name escapes me, it had something to do with blue lilac flowers), the main twist will shock and surprise you and you will enjoy it more then I did. However, I didn't appreciate the fact that the author left out a certain medical exception that would have allowed me to guess correctly.

Although the defense team has slight physical evidence, Haller works on Lisa having been set up and there being a \\"fifth witness,\\" and someone else behind the murder.<br /><br />Could there be a book with a more timely plot?  Yet rather than seeming trite, Connolly makes foreclosures a fascinating backdrop for his latest Mickey Haller book. His inclusion of detailed information on everything from the processes for foreclosures, setting up book and movie deals to pay for legal defense, and legal and police procedures adds interest and veracity to the story, as well as to the character, but can also take you out of the plot when they become overlong.<br /><br />Connolly constructs his characters very well.  Because he provides their history, there is no feeling of having been dropped into the series midstream.  You know who each character is and how they relate to one another.  There are several character threads to the story, and you care about what happens in each case.<br /><br />Connolly uses language well and writes very evocative descriptions but doesn't include enough of them.  He has an excellent ear for dialogue, occasional touches of humor such as when Mickey is asked whether the actor Matthew McConaughey would be a good choice to play Mickey in a movie--which, in fact, McConaughey is doing.  There is also a fleeting cameo by Connolly's character of Harry Bosch, Connolly's primary series, and a reference to the artist Hieronymus Bosch, after whom the character is named.<br /><br />The plot is very well constructed.  It is particularly nice that Haller, and his team, during their investigation, stay within the law.  There is no smart hacker on the side or \\"don't ask how I got this\\" moment which is refreshing.  Connolly writes the physical scenes, whether violence or seduction, well.  It was curious and apparent that he was comfortable writing a scene of graphic violence, while seduction stopped at the bedroom door.  There were very effective twists and, at one point, a good build of intensity.  The ending, with very powerful plot twists, was extremely well done.<br /><br />There were weaknesses to the story.  Connolly heavily salts the story with mini-cliffhangers which are explained soon thereafter but became annoying.  The character used the analogy of a court case being similar to the classical piece \\"Bolero\\" which consists of many small high point but finally builds to a dramatic crescendo.  The story did follow that pattern, but there were times where it felt as though it took a long time to get there.<br /><br />Keeping the audio critique separate; Mr. Giles was not the best possible reader.  His tone often sounded belligerent or almost angry, when the scene didn't warrant it.  There were a couple times where it was difficult to distinguish between dialogue and narration.  With a physical book, one can pass quickly through the detailed procedural information without losing the flow of the story.  This is not as true of the audio version.  Although the information was interesting, there were times it felt as though it overwhelmed the story.<br /><br />\\"The Fifth Witness\\" was not Connolly's best book and certainly did not come up to the level of \\"The Lincoln Lawyer.\\"  It was, however, fascinating for its timeliness and engrossing enough to keep one reading.<br /><br />THE FIFTH WITNESS (Legal Myst-Mickey Haller-Los Angeles, CA-Cont) - G+<br />Connelly, Michael; Read by Peter Giles - 2nd true Haller book<br />Hachette Audio, , ©2011, Audiobook - ISBN:  9781600247224o keep one reading.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|This is the first time I have ever written a book review or even cared to really. This book captured me from the first page and I skipped meals and sleep to finish it, I could not put it down and was sad when it ended. I found myself thinking about it even after I finished reading, this book could be true to life for some people. As obsessive as Travis is you have to root for him, he is impulsive and careless and HOTTTTT but there is something about him that makes your heart melt for him. I love that Abby has her own demons she is running from and her uncanny ability to bring Travis to his knees. I laughed and I cried and I rooted for Travis and Pidge thru the whole story. I think that this story needs to be carried on aleast for one more book, I'm not ready to have it end :(
B0056BMK6K|5.0|This is an enjoyable read, but more importantly, there is true gold here. I have a background in marketing and found myself nodding as I read through this because some of it seems so obvious, yet little of it was information I already knew or was putting into place. Interestingly, I have one author friend who is making crazy money selling her ebooks, she averaged about $20k a month for 4 or 5 months in a row and then almost hit 50k in the month of June. How is she doing it? As I read through this book, I realized that she is doing just about everything mentioned here in terms of marketing and it's working very well.    For $4.99 this book is a bargain. I know I will be rereading and implementing as many of his suggestions as possible, both as I write my books and then market them.     If you know any authors, this would make a great gift for them! I have several published author friends who have been resisting ebooks and will encourage them to read this and then go for it. We've only just begun to scratch the surface of epublishing.
0143039431|5.0|Over the years I've read and heard from many people about The Grapes of Wrath.  The comments ranged from, \\"it's overrated\\" to \\"it's the best book ever written by an American author\\".  I will not try to make you believe either.  However, this is the most powerful writing that I have ever read.  There are passages in this book that just make you stop and sit back to think a bit.  One that hit me very hard was midway through the book: \\"Pray God some day kind people won't all be poor\\".  This line was written in response to the destitute tenant farmers scrabbling for work with nearly no money putting a few coins each on a pile in front of a tent where a little boy had died of malnutrition so that the family could have him buried.<br /><br />Throughout history the American dream has had many speed bumps or as in the case of this novel, barriers. But the spirit of the American people in every instance has overcome all.  This is a book about that spirit, nearly broken, but not ever completely.  There isn't much that can befall a family that the Joad family did not have to deal with.  It's a story of persistence and overcoming all odds without losing your own humanity.  When everything is against you and you can still look at the other person as someone in more need, then you will begin to understand what made these people.<br /><br />Seventy years later, this story has as much or more relevance than the period from which it came.  The world is absorbing yet another economic crisis.  There are many differences between now and the era of the Dust Bowl and Steinbeck brings these to the foreground with his typical prescience.<br /><br />The family unit is front and center in this work.  The mother and father were so over matched by the elements of nature, progress and technology and just plain happenstance that every member of the family stepped in and picked up the entire group on their shoulders when it was needed.  Looking back at this particular element of the story by way of 2011 makes me think that as a culture, we have lost some of this most fundamental building block of society.<br /><br />As liberal and progressive a thinker as John Steinbeck was in presenting this story, I cannot help but think just how conservative his thinking by today's standards.  His use of ostracizing the children at croquet and then using a similar method on adults at the government camp would be thought to be draconian today, but in fact these were commonly used forms of punishment to protect the whole of society from those that wanted to break it down.  Are we missing this element in today's society?<br /><br />In The Grapes of Wrath, several years of dust storms and drought have brought on major changes in the way farms and farmland are owed and operated.  The big, bad corporations and banks take over the land when the tenant farmers are not able to make their payments.  Is today's economic crash much different?  Are we substituting housing for farms?  How many of those subsequent bankers lost their jobs to a different but very real economic stress in 2008 as many large banks had to downsize and re-organize?<br /><br />The relevance is real, the emotion palpable, and the understanding that it could happen to anyone is scary.  Yes, The Grapes of Wrath is as terrific as it is terrifying, real as it is relevant, and is as American as Apple Pie.  If you haven't read it before, please do so.  Instead of ridiculous demands in our schools to read Great Expectations, The Grapes of Wrath should be the book of choice.

0525951652|3.0|First of all let me say that this is a good book. A lot of people may see the 3 stars and think mediocre. I give excellent books 4 stars and there are only about 10 books I've read in my life that I would give 5 stars to. I'm not like some of the goons on this website that give 5 stars to anything they come across that seems interesting.    On to the book. What I enjoyed most about it was the historical aspect. Follett does a great job of telling the story of the nations of World War I. He really captures the views and opinions of the general public and those in the government in each of the countries thoughout this time. I learned a lot about Europe's history from this book. I constantly found myself reading a chapter and then heading to the web to research more about the Russian Revolution or Women's Suffrage or the assassination of Franz Ferdinand. These are great events in the history of mankind that few people know much about.    The story itself was good, it kept me interested. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a thirst for knowledge on the world's history, but is interested in reading more of a story than a textbook.

0307272702|4.0|I could have given this 5 stars had it not been a little long on the historical \\"background\\" of why we are fat that lasted almost the first half of the book.  However, it DID drive the message home.  Each time I \\"get\\" the message of one research/study, another one is cited.  But just like one of the admonishing nuns at private school, at the end, I'm glad I sat thru the \\"education.\\"<br /><br />Here's the first thing to note: This is not a diet book, as I thought it would be.  Duh, doesn't the title imply that already?  Now I say.  It is one book, I wish I had read a long time ago to have ended those miserable hunger periods.  I've grown to accept that being hungry is good.  A mantra I've espoused.  Hunger is good. Hunger is good. Feeling tired from hunger is good. No energy is good.  WHAT was I thinking?!?!?<br /><br />Read it.  Bear with the science and perhaps you might just find yourself redeemed from starvation \\"diets.\\"
0143039431|5.0|Enough review have been written about this book. I just want to say the following:<br /><br />This is one only about 5 books I have read in my life that I would give 5 stars to. It is more than a book, it is a statement on Americana. Steinbeck's masterpiece, every sentence has meaning. This book transcends generations. Read it!

0198326769|4.0|Whoa.  Read this book, it will take an adult reader about 2 or 3 hours will stay with you forever. Not a big detailed review I know, but sometimes there are no words.  Put this in your cart.
B000060P79|1.0|I can't believe anyone could listen to this cd more than once.  Singing about how much you hate living at home and doing your homework is just pathetic.  Even teenagers who live at home and are in bands dont sing about stuff like that.  WOW - this is simply horrible.  Simple songs, simple lyrics.  Sounds like kid bop or something, just horrible period.  This band sounds like something manufactured by disney.  Its hard to believe this is a legit band - i would rather listen to the jonas brothers.
B004UBB3KQ|5.0|Debut album is outstanding.  It's unique in that it appeals to all ages. Live show is even better.  Love the cover artwork by Japayork, Mark Fosters friend from Europe.  The music is addictive...you'll wake up with it in your head.

B0034C9CFK|4.0|I didn't realize Alan Jackson even put an album out in 2010.  After listening to the cd, I don't remember ever hearing the two singles, \\"Hard Hat & a Hammer\\" or \\"Its just that Way\\" on the radio.  This cd is probably as good as anything from the 90s, when he was in his prime.  This is better than 4 stars, but not quite 5.  I would give this 5 stars, if it weren't for \\"After 17.\\"  Songs like \\"That's Where I Belong,\\" and \\"Hard Hat..\\" are similar to \\"Little Man,\\" and \\"where I come from\\"  The song \\"Freight Train,\\" has a driving bluegrass sound that you just don't hear on today's radio.  I'm not big on slow country songs, but the cover of \\"Till the End,\\" is great.  About any song on here would've been big if it were released in the mid-late 90s.  The two singles released off the cd are okay, but \\"Big Green Eyes,\\" and \\"Taillights Blue,\\" are much better.  Anyone who likes the early Alan Jackson would really like this.  Probably not for people into 'pop' country with loud guitars and rap-like rhythm.  Steel guitars and fiddles carry this album.  A country music great making great country music.
B003NOMHGK|4.0|From the previous episode, Amy gets infatuated by the Doctor. The Doctor is interested in Amy as a platonic relationship and not sexual. He tells her this and reminds her that he is over 900 years old but Amy doesn't care. So, the Doctor gets her husband-to-be Rory to join them on their adventures.    Amy, Rory, and the Doctor goes back to ancient Venice to explore this romantic city. This trip was a gift to Amy and Rory as their marriage present. The field trip started off fun but it soon turns into a mystery. Women are being turned into Vampires and it's up to the Doctor to find out why. Towards the end of the episode, the gang discovers that the Vampires weren't Vampires at all but aliens from another world trying to populate the Earth by turning women into themselves.    I like this episode but it wasn't my favorite. I think this episode is a tribute to all the Vampire TV shows before it. It was interesting at first when the story introduced Vampires but it turned a little silly when the audience finds out that these Vampires are really Aliens. I love the introduction scene where the Doctor pops out of a large cake instead of a beautiful woman during Rory's Stag party. I also like Thomas Arthur Darvill who plays Rory. He plays Rory as this not-so-bright guy and he does it with ease.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|very fun game not to difficult, a little short.  but this is my first game i actually completed something about it held my intrest.
B000001FXX|5.0|There's nothing I can say about this that hasn't been said, nothing I can add to the critique of this cd.  One of the best of all time.  Reggae infused with blues.  This is a must have for any Bob Marley fan, any reggae fan, or anyone new to the genre looking for a place to start.  \\"No Woman No Cry\\" is one of the best songs in the history of the world, and every other track on here is exemplary Bob Marley.  Great cd, all the way through.
B003MLFVGW|5.0|This is part 2 of a two part episode of Doctor Who fighting the Weeping Angels. When the Doctor finds out that there is an army of Weeping Angels inside the mausoleum, he and his gang run for their lives. They manage to get inside the wrecked spaceship and they have only moments until they all die. When all hope was gone, an odd thing started to appear that saved their lives. A large crack in the wall that glows with light appeared out of nowhere. This crack is the same crack that Amy saw when she was a little girl back in episode one. This mysterious glowing crack seems to follow Amy whereever she goes but it's more sinister than ever. It has the ability to erase people's existance if you allow it to touch you. The Doctor uses this mysterious crack to his advantage. He tips the spaceship making all the Weeping Angels fall into the crack.    This is an awesome episode! There's a scene where the Doctor and his gang walk through a dark forest inside the spaceship. It looked creepy and the Weeping Angels looked menacing. The scarist part is when Amy was about to die because she had a Weeping Angel inside her and the only way to save her life was to have her not open her eyes. I enjoyed every minute of this episode.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|What can I say that has not come in the more that 1200 5-star reviews before me?  This book is fascinating, gut-wrenching, heart-warming, thought-provoking, and suspenseful all at the same time.  I literally could not put it down.  Incredibly well-written and should be a required read for our political representatives. God bless our men and women that fight for this country.
B000FC130E|5.0|I have spent the begining of my summer engrossed in Neverwhere, that place where the people who fall through the cracks live an enormously engrossing, challening life rich in color and adventure in the past and present.  What is figurative in this world is literal in that one because simile and metaphor give way to what is--either simply or in a very complex way.<br /><br />Neverwhere is Neil Gaiman's 1998 novel set in London Below, the alternative to London Above, where antihero Richard Mayhew loses everything--a beautiful, albeit shallow and difficult, fiancee, a job, and an apartment (oh, and his identity, for a while)--when he helps Door, an injured refugee of London Below who is being hunted by contract killers as she seeks to find out who killed her family and why.<br /><br />Richard and Door and their strange posse move across London Below in an epic adventure that questions every truth you can think of--heaven, hell, love, friendship, family, integrity--in search of a simple truth.<br /><br />The search for the truth becomes a game of survival for Richard and Door. Having survived, Richard learns that surviving is a fine thing because it took everything he had.  Falling through the cracks is a good thing if, in the falling, you find what is excellent in yourself and in someone you learn to love.  There really is no going back.<br /><br />Neverwhere is exquisitely engaging and funny, and it is beautifully written.  [[ASIN:0060557818 Neverwhere: A Novel]]
B002BU0DPE|2.0|I got this headset because the cheap headset I got with my xbox was going bad, and I needed a new one. Of course when it comes to headsets there are turtle beach and tritons. Checking this out, i saw it worked with both ps3 and xbox. After reading the positive reviews, I bought them. When I got them I wasn't disappointed. The game, the chat, and literally everything sounds better. But the very next day, the mic malfunctioned. It either would make the people I was talking to hear an echo that made me unable to be understood, and then just stopped submitting the sound to the xbox. This could have just been my headset malfunctioning, but if it is the headset design, I figured anyone who is buying this for an xbox should know.
B0050PYNO4|4.0|Part road movie, part sci-fi, part government thriller, \\"Paul\\" is enjoyable on all fronts.  The two human leads are engaging and funny, and Seth Rogan as alien Paul is funny without going overboard.<br /><br />Lots in inside jokes about famous sci-fi films, shows, and tropes.  Pay close attention to the tune the band is playing in the Country & Western bar.<br /><br />A friend loaned me this movie  (an, er, \\"advanced copy\\").  Normally I don't care for the films he likes but this case was happily different.<br /><br />The \\"surprise cameo\\" at the end isn't that much of a surprise actually, and the actress's line readings are a bit stiff (much like her performance in a recent James Cameron movie).  But everyone else is a delight to watch, especially Kristin Wiig.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B004EPZ08E|4.0|I recall reading something a year or two ago about employee dissatisfaction. It commented that it tended to increase during times of economic trouble because employees who felt unhappy in the workplace didn't have the ability to escape. They were stuck with their current jobs, since leaving might mean they couldn't find another one. They also seldom got sympathy from other people who said, \\"Hey, at least you have a job!\\" This reached its culmination for me when the place where I worked put up a motivational poster that said, I kid you not, \\"I should be grateful I have a job.\\" Indeed.    In this time of economic troubles, it's perhaps surprising that a movie like this, where three friends get together to kill each other's horrible bosses, hasn't come along already. Well, it sort of did in 1980 with 9 to 5, but that was a bit different. I don't think I recall Franklin Hart, Jr, shooting anyone.    The movie's title bosses are a corporate president (Kevin Spacey), a cokehead who inherited his father's chemical company (Colin Farrell), and, in one of the funnier performances, a dentist who doubles as a sexual predator (Jennifer Aniston). Their oppressed employees are, respectively, a man who is working hard for a position the corporate president takes for himself (Jason Bateman), a hard-working employee who loved the cokehead's father (Jason Sudekis), and a dental hygienist/sex offender who is recently engaged (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia's Charlie Day). One night while mutually commiserating with each other in a bar a plan begins to take shape. What if they killed their bosses? Soon they have a \\"murder consultant\\" in the form of one MF Jones (Jamie Foxx), and, with vague memories that confuse Strangers on a Train with Throw Mama from the Train, the make ready to make murder.    I had no great expectations going into this film, but I was surprised at how enjoyable it was and how much I liked it (also surprising? The ten-year-old boy sitting next me. Some parents...). The film is as raunchy as you'd expect any adult-oriented comedy to be, but it uses its raunch to great effect. There's the expected jokes centering around sex and bodily functions, but nothing too extreme.    I was also surprised at how intelligent the movie is. At the start I was coming up with objections to the notion that the characters needed to kill their bosses instead of just get new ones, only to find the screenplay explaining why they couldn't just up and quit. I was also greatly amused when the friends ran into a former pal of theirs who'd lost his last job with Lehman Brothers and since had been forced to resort to offering a \\"hearty handshake\\", as it were, to men in bars.    The performances were excellent all around. Spacey in particular seemed to be having a great time playing a deliciously evil man, while Aniston was clearly happy to ditch her good girl image. Day, who is a relative newcomer to film, plays a character not dissimilar to that of Charlie Kelly, proves that he can certainly hold his own on the screen with the big boys (and girl).    The movie is ably directed by Seth Gordon, who keeps the action moving at a decent, but not frenetic, pace. He also knows when to throw in a good Tarantino homage. It's produced by the somewhat infamous Brett Ratner who proves that as a director, he makes for an acceptable producer.    This isn't the best comedy ever, but it was a good time at the movies, and after a summer that's included films like the rather dull Green Lantern and the aggressively boring Transformers: Bark at the Moon, I'll take what I can get.
B004BLJQOK|4.0|Let Me In deals with both one boy's need to find acceptance, friendship and love, but also the darkness surrounding vampirism. Owen is a young boy who feels a sense of alienation at home with his parents having marital problems. He is also is the target of bullies at schools. He internalizes ideas of revenge with his tormentors at times when alone. Drawn to his next door neighbor, Abby, he strikes up a friendship with her and they begin to pal around. It becomes clear to Owen that Abby is not like other children. She doesn't seem to have knowledge of simple everyday things, and is seemingly never around at school, which gives Owens clues that there is something shady about her. He also overhears what appears to be verbal abuse in her home next door. A string of bizarre murders leads one policeman to believe some cult is responsible. As Owen longs more and more for friendship, he gets closer and closer to Abby, even while he suspects she is in some way connected with the murders.     A remake of the recent Swedish film Let the Right One In and based on the book by John Ajvide Lindqvist, Let Me In is a well-thought out, intelligent horror film that has the right balance of mood, plot and gore. Although it has elements of violence and gore, it doesn't overdo it to the point of making this the focus. There's a real understated quality to the film, especially the dialogue between Owen and Abby, but it works here because both characters are trying to channel acceptance from each other and understand their conflicted inner worlds. Both leads (Chloe Grace Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee) are solid in their roles as the two friends.     I haven't watched the original film yet, but looking forward to checking it out after seeing this. Unlike many horrors films of today, Let Me In actually makes you feel a little bit for the characters and engages you in their story.
B002ZG975Q|2.0|A rich, handsome preppie who is the son of a famous newscaster is a living megaphone for his father's callously superficial values: physical appearance and money are all that matter in life, and anyone who has them should rule the world.    I had really liked Vanessa Hudgens in [[ASIN:B000F2BNW2 High School Musical]], and I was willing to give newcomer Alex Pettyfer a chance. He certainly looks the part of a gorgeous guy, which is what the hero is supposed to be. It's just too bad that the two of them had to struggle to make something of a hopeless plot.    There have been many retellings of the fairy tale of Beauty and the Beast over the years, but many aspects of it don't translate at all well to a contemporary setting. Yes, the problem of the Beast holding Beauty captive is somewhat solved by having her be at least somewhat willing to be the captive, though she is lied to in order to trick her into being willing by her drug-addict father who basically sells her to Beast (which, of course, is not untrue to the original fairy tale, but again, is very strange in a modern setting). Secondly, it does not make the story more appealing to a modern audience by having Beast stalk Beauty before tricking her into staying with him.    One of the few things the [[ASIN:3833938447 book]] this is based on has going for it is the big reveal at the end as to who the witch truly is and what her motivation for cursing the hero is. Of all the things in the book's plot that needed to be improved on, why pick this one, which was fine? What they did to the witch instead turned the story into pure sap.    Other complaints:     Why would this superficial hero want to run for president of a save-the-earth type club? For that matter, why would any school, especially a prep school, consider such an election worth a school-wide campaign? I could see it as that important if he were running for student body president--but president of a club? What a strange, unrealistic plot choice.    The actor playing the father was not handsome enough to play a character who worshipped beauty, both in males and females.     Turning the hero into a tattooed skinhead instead of how he appeared in the book--as a furry, clawed Beast much like in the [[ASIN:B003DZX44I Disney movie]]--and then asking a modern audience to think that would get him a second glance in New York City doesn't make sense to me. Maybe if he were in a small town in the Midwest is might be a problem. But New York? I don't think so.    In the book, the Beast also had strength to go with his new look, which was also something that made sense to me, but in the movie, the Beast has no particular powers at all. He also, unlike in the fairy tale, never does anything noble or sacrificial at all.     The climax scene at the hero and heroine's school was not romantic to me. It made me cringe.     All in all, I have to say I was very glad I saw this on DVD instead of in a theater. The hero is so passive through 99% of the story, I kept falling asleep and eventually got up and did some exercise to keep me awake.
B000JQTWPO|4.0|The Moonstone is dated.  That's not surprising; it was written over a hundred years ago.  But this is the father of all mystery novels, so there's no better place to start than here.  A classic, and one every mystery fan should read.
B00004YYDI|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies ever, and watching the full uncut version is the only way to go.<br />The only problem here - the price for uncut version is almost double of the regular. Still would recommend to buy this one, because it is worth it.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|A friend told me there wasn't a song on this CD she didn't like, and she was right. An absolute \\"must purchase\\"!!
B000JSI79O|5.0|One of many great shows from the late 90s in my opinion. \\"Early Edition\\" and \\"Charmed\\" being two of my favourites. Shows combining everyday life and something supernatural, which I think is an awesome and very entertaining combination. That was a very popular trend in TV shows created between 1995 and 2000 (\\"Buffy\\", \\"Angel\\" and \\"Touched by an Angel\\" are other examples of that kind of TV series). For those who don't know what this is all about, it follows three witch sisters living in San Fransisco. They have three different powers (bring time to a standstill, see the future and move objects using only the mind), but (almost) no one except them know they have these powers or know they are witches. They have to use these powers to deal with everything from demons to more regular stuff. You can probably imagine how entertaining it is. I also happen to find Holly Marie Combs and Alyssa Milano VERY HOT! Highly recommended. I have always just really liked the atmosphere in this show.

0618918248|5.0|I feel bad for not reviewing this long ago. I loved/love this book. I read it quicker than any other book I've ever read, I couldn't get enough. It came at a perfect time for me. I get so tired of the undeserved respect that's given to false and fantastical ideas. Richard feels the same. Enlighten yourself in a non-candy-coated book of rational dialogue and the ever persistent truth of scientific evidence.
B004L3AQLU|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie! Watching it, we really felt part of it, like they were close friends of ours who deserved our support during their trials and tribulations! The story started well, held our attention the whole time, and although we knew how it would probably end, we loved how it got there! we will watch it again and again in the future.
0452286751|5.0|Wish I would have discovered this book along time ago.  The storyline of Roark and his struggles through life as he is not wiling to compromise what's important to him was a gripping read.  Actually caught myself staying up late at night trying to squeeze in just one more chapter.  Never had a book that actually wanted me to cuss a character (Elisworth)  for being such a crooked manipulative man.         While it is an incredible book that everyone should read there are parts that tend to get long it the tooth, particularly Elisworth's   Phislophy rants.
B004RC8NXI|3.0|I thought the movie was ok, but found the story line a little difficult to follow. I think we all know where this movie was heading, and I was looking forward to seeing how it got there. I wouldn`t recommend it as a guide!  Apart from this movie, I received this package from Amazon some 5 days before they told me it should arrive, so thanks Amazon, well done!
B002ZG9800|5.0|A Jim Carrey film generallly screams goofy comedy. In this case, we have goofy behavior in a \\"dramedy\\", based on a true story. The outrageous events are reminiscent of \\"Catch Me If You Can\\", but the bottom line is it's a love story. It just happens to involve gay persons. After reading some reviews, I decided to get in my own 5-stars. Carrey really centers this complex character with terrific sensitivity, as well as his requsite smarm and charm. He is the perfect choice to play this most charismatic character.  It's actually sweet natured, and, regarding the love story aspect, quite profound. Ewan McGregor looked pretty, but it wasn't too much of a stretch for him. He's always reliable. There was very little reference to gay activity, rather a simple desire of 2 people who want to be together. DVD extras are fine; there's an AIDS sub-plot that was left out, only referenced at the end. The \\"Sull'aria\\" from The Marriage of Figaro, so well used in \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\", figures in, I think, as a tribute to good prison films.This is not a prison film; it's a love story. Pure and simple. The fact that it's based on fact made it quite intriguing, at least to me.
B0042U94UQ|4.0|I've heard nothing but good things about this movie since it came out so I finally decided to give it a whirl.<br />...I liked it.<br />Lots of laughs, a great message.<br />A creative and interesting script.<br />The pacing was spot on.<br />Good music.<br />My favorite characters were the little yellow minion guys.<br />I could watch a whole movie of them interacting lol.<br />I really don't have any major complaints.<br />Is it up there with the best in animation?<br />.....I'd say it's on par with Shrek and animated films of that sort.<br />Great film, definitely worth a watch.<br />Recommended.
B0051BVQFG|1.0|The plot kinda reminds me of Independence day. Where the aliens have mothership that needs to be destroyed to disable the drones. Absolutely nonsense. Yes fastward is the way to see this movie.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Great story set during WWII and follows the lives of several men in Europe during WWII.  Originally bought this for our son and after watching the series got one for ourselves.  Haven't had anyone yet who has watched this that didn't rave about it in the end!!!  Does contain a lot of graphic war scenes as one would expect so probably not for younger viewers.
B004XN3FHA|5.0|Wow what a flashlight I received! You won't regret the purchase if you order this Fenix model. It probably delivers more light than you need at the max level (800 lumens) as I've satisfied in High mode (@ 335 lumens) in a typical use. The double switches come in handy as well. Delivery from Amazon came on time as promised. Thanks for a wonderful service.
031603441X|5.0|Fabulous book, very well written.  Keith gives incredible insights into the times - the 60's and 70's - and the impact that the music the Stones wrote had - and continues to have - on the world.  Admittedly, I'm a life long Rolling Stones fan, but anyone who's lived through these decades, and even those who haven't, will find this book an amazing read.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|This game is one of my favorites on other platforms, but on my Samsung Droid Charge any level with a decent amount of plants and zombies causes it to slow down to a crawl, then sometimes the phone reboots! Very disappointed! I really wanted this for my phone, but I've installed it.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|When I started watching this program, I intended to dislike it. This has got to be one of the few remakes (in film and television) that turned out well.    The old series was AWESOME! They shot it in Hawaii, back when the film had to be sent airmail back to LA to be shown on television. They hired Hawaiians, back when television was Caucasians only (with very few exceptions). Long before the over done buddy cop thing was all over television, they were doing it right. It was a serious program, with occasional funny parts.    The new series is very good. It is edited and paced for the FAR shorter attention spans of the modern audience. Like another good program NCIS, the crimes are secondary to the interaction between the characters. All the actors are very good, and it is a joy for me to watch the program. Danny's divorce is one malfunction after another, and you laugh because you are glad it isn't you. Chin Ho, is a very honorable man, who was accused of taking bribes, they couldn't find any proof, but that didn't stop his reputation from getting destroyed. Kono is not just a gorgeous woman and put there for window dressing, she is a inexperienced, but very intelligent woman who is more than capable of taking care of herself.... this is a rare thing on television! McGarrett is a very experienced SecOps soldier. He lacks subtlety, and tends to go at a problem head on, this drives Danny (who prefers to be quiet and subtle) nuts!    I also think it is funny that only in America can an Australian doing a very good American accent, plays a SEAL that was born in Hawaii... and the two 'Hawaiians' look suspiciously like Koreans! :)    There is very little about this series that I don't like. The new version of the theme is excellent, but they cut it too short. I hope they will have a full length version on the DVD set, as a extra.
1416550550|2.0|I dont understand all the great reviews.  For me The Forgotten Garden was boring.  It's about  finding out who abandoned a little girl and who her family was.    I guess I'm not that into mysteries and  I thought it was predictable.    I will not recommend this book to anyone.
B004GYOQ6A|5.0|I've played a few labyrinth type games and this one of the better ones.  The 3D is a little misleading because 3D cell phones are coming out and this does not take advantage of that feature.  It is only 3D in that it moves around several dimensions and isn't flat.    The game is pretty responsive and I didn't notice any lag.  The challenges are some of the better ones I've seen.  This was actually a lot more fun than other Labyrinth games I've played and it kept my interest far longer.

B00138KF6W|5.0|I needed to download the Man in the Mirror for work, but when I saw the entire bad album for ten bucks I figured what the heck and got the ablum instead.  And after all these years (decades) it is still enjoyable to listen to.  Think what you may of MJ's personal life, this many knows how to entertain and make beats that are still fun for generations.<br /><br />This is one of Michael's best albums.  We took a trip the other week and probably listened to this about fifteen times and never soured on the songs.  Bad, Man in the Mirror, and Smooth Criminal still remain favorite songs of mine to this day.  This is an album that should be in any collection, especially if you are 30+ years old.
B00005AREQ|5.0|There is no need to say more about the fastidious and phenomenal Jeff Beck. Every album is a painstakingly crafted masterpiece. This one has the Beatles' sound man (no offense meant by that term) George Martin at the helm of the affairs and that results in a clear and precise sound which is a big departure from his previous works. The sound involves funk, jazz and blues which I feel Beck was trying to move away from at this point in his career. There are very few guitarists out there who know the meaning of the term 'restraint' (Joe Satriani is another obvious example), but Jeff Beck takes it to another level in the first few tracks in this album (which includes a Beatles cover; what was he trying to do? Make the Beatles relevant to the six string community or what?). Just when you listen and settle into that comfort zone with the initial tracks, 'Scatterbrain' (a monster of a track with its intensity and humongous collage of sounds) comes and knocks you off your feet. And then the master orunds it off by some tribute tracks to his heroes. Just what you expect from a classic album; creativity, unpredictability and intensity just when you need, not scattered all around, only concentrated in some places where its really needed. Enjoy.............
B0058P7KUA|3.0|This worked great and it was fun to play for a while.  The one liners between cutscenes are actually hillarious.  It was fun but after a while it just got repetetive.  One thing I didn't like was how the buttons would move and my thumbs would keep running into each other.  I guess I should check for a setting on that to keep them stationary but I've already lost interest into the game about ten levels into it.    The graphics are okay, and the sound effects are funny.  I like how he says different things depending on which age you are playing in.  But, again, it gets rather repetitive after a while.
B003V4AK8E|3.0|Ok first of all i just got this controller from gamestop and it was the best so far. it had a rubbery grip but very very sturdy so its really horrible grip. THERE ARE NO or just a lil very  very like .000001 delay on the right analog stick. people who said there was a delay was a complete bullcrap prob from other companies trying to get publicity so they try to manipulate others going against them.     Pro:  Sturdy  Soft finish  Very sturdy and nice  grip  CAN CLOSE BY HOLDING THE HOME BUTTON OR THE PS BUTTON for thAT controller    Cons  the l2 is a lil bit hard to press to work so press hard to make it work,  many deadzones
B003Y5H5KQ|3.0|The action and fight sequences in this film are amazing, considering most of them involve a teenage girl.  I thought the acting on behalf of all the main characters were phenominal as well.  The plot kept you on the edge of your seat and jumpting through the entire movie as you never did know what was going to happen next, and when.    But when it ended, my wife turned to me and asked, \\"What was the point of that?\\"  And I had to think about it because, she was right, the action was good and the story came to some sort of closure, but there was zero character development.  Yeah, Hanna learns a few things about who she was and her past, but her character arc didn't show any growth.  She didn't have to overcome anything.  In fact, almost everything placed in her way as an obstacle seemed too easy for her to resolve.  She didn't grow any, she only learned new information going from scene to scene almost like a robot following her program.  It wouldn't surprise me if they made a sequel and revealed that she is, indeed, a robot.  (Okay, I'd be surprised, but not blown away)    And because of this, I can't give this a 5 star rating because that is a major flaw in any story.  So see it for the action.  Enjoy it for the special effects, gun fights, and car chases.  But don't get your hope high on falling in love with Hanna because she is not an easy character to identify with or root for.
B000GDH9JQ|4.0|Mikhail Baryshnikov and Gregory Hines both do a great job in this movie, and they are such wonderfully talented dancers.  The plot sounds really farfetched, but we forget how secretive and controlled the Soviet Union was during the Cold War.     The plot: Nikolai is a world-famous ballet dancer who has already defected from the Soviet Union, making him a criminal in the eyes of the KGB.  So when the plane he's on happens to make an emergency landing in Russia, the KGB won't let him leave again.  They make it understood that his options are dancing for the Russian ballet again (to make the world think Nikolai returned voluntarily and as a symbol of Soviet superiority) - or likely prison.     Raymond (Hines) is an American dancer who became disillusioned by racism in the US and traumatized by the Vietnam war - Raymond fled to the USSR and married a Russian woman.  The KGB coerces him into watching Nikolai and making him rehearse.  Nikolai and Raymond clash at first, but start to understand each other.  All the while Nikolai tries to find a way to escape . . . no easy task since it's the \\"White Nights\\", the time of year in northern Russia when the sun never completely sets and there is no cover of darkness.      Somewhat melodramatic, but it's a solid film with fine performances and some wonderful dance scenes. If this movie piques your interest about life in the 80s under Communist regimes, also check out \\"The Lives of Others,\\" a German film about '80s East Germany.
B0058P7KUA|2.0|I installed this on a HTC Incredible running CM7. I've only gotten it to run once or twice. All the other times, I just got a black screen. It needs a re-working to make it compatible with more devices. When it works, it's pretty fun. Half humor, half action.
B000002MZ6|1.0|I originally intended to write a lengthy exposition as a catharsis for purchasing this album.    Instead, I will be as laconic as possible.    This album is bad. It is the most contrived vision of serenity. There are African chants, Native American chants, boys choirs, epic-fail guitar solos, all set in a minimalist and uninspiring orchestral arrangement. It sounds dated. Like, really 90's dated. I am bewildered by the number of positive reviews.     After deciding I resented myself for making this purchase, I tried to cherry pick the songs I would add to my library, trying to salvage my spent dollars. After listening all the way through, I can safely say that I wouldn't add this album to my worst enemy's library. To say this sounds like an album you would see at the CD rack at the end of the greeting card aisle at WalMart-- the one with the push-for-preview buttons-- is insulting to the pitiful, soulless, sell outs who produce those. I fear that if I played this album for my future children (hey, it could happen), they would grow up to be Riverdance wannabe, bare-chested-white-bellowing-shirt-wearer-on-mountaintop fairies who live in a land of chastity and consider combining bagpipes and Dream Theatre-esque guitar riff crescendos the peak of Earthly bodily ecstasy.
B004OWPWEO|5.0|A must have for all fans! From the banter between Bruce and the audience to the stripped down \\"For You\\", ballad style with just Roy on piano & Bruce on vocals. Everything about this two CD set is very raw and powerful. Wings For Wheels (Thunder Road) is different than what ended up on \\"Born To Run\\", which was released six months after this performance. This is Bruce & The E-Street band pulling out all the stops! So buy this one and remember Bruce & The Band for what they were before the rest of the world knew them. Which would be as superstar's!! One of New Jersey's finest. RIP-Big Man..
B000NVIXFK|4.0|A very good but not great album by my favorite band Rush. I has elements of greatest but falls flat at times. The production is vastly improved but the songwriting compared to Vapor Trails suffers a bit here. Sure they tried a return to the past with more instrumentals but a few of the other songs just can't even compare to the past, sorry guys. It is a fine effort but misses the mark of great. I agree that some of the songs are plodding and monotonous but still there is much to like even in those for this writer. Here is a breakdown of songs and my rating :    1. Far Cry, a great opener and great on the Dvd \\"Snakes and Arrows Live. Deserving of the single opener of this album. 9/10    2. Armor and Sword, although it may be plodding musically, I do like it, musically and lyrically. 8/10    3. Workin' Them Angels, cool song and with a good chorus. Probably the best sing along song in the repetroire of this album. good musically and lyrically. 9/10    4. The Larger Bowl, a good attempt at relating to suffering. a little bit plodding and repetitive. a good but not great song 5/10    5. Spindrift, a great recovery to greatness on this cd. The most passionate song here. the imagery of waves crashing on the shore seals the deal. the first perfect 10. 10/10    6. The Main Monkey Business, The return of the keys is evident here which is a plus, thankfully.although I am really not a fan of instrumentals, Rush or otherwise, this is a perfect one. 10/10    7. The Way the Wind Blows, politically minded(pray and pass the amunition)(like we're back in the dark ages)(from the middle-east to the middle-west). a good start musically to the song, the chorus is fine except, \\"we can only bow to here and now\\" with Ged's high pitch that ruins the moment, sorry Ged. That part should have been left on the cutting room floor but that is a only a minor complaint. otherwise, good song. 7/10.     8. Hope,good but not great instrumental by Alex with a nod to David Gilmour. 6/10    9. Faithless,the third perfect 10 moment on the album IMHO. great rockin song. great imagery(like a stone in the river against the floods of spring, I will quietly resist)(like the willows in the wind or the cliffs along the ocean, I will quietly resist). that is like the Neil of old. 10/10    10. Bravest Face,a downhill slide.I sympathize with the parts about facing fear but that does not translate to a good song. 2/10.     11. Good News First, continues the downhill slide, plodding musically and lyrically. filler. should have been axed. 2/10    12. Malignant Narcissism, excellent instrumental, deserving of the Grammy nomination nod, but too darn short.9/10     13. We hold on, very good and a good closing song.an uplifting song and great Ged vocals at the end. 9/10

B000003FD9|5.0|NB: My review refers to the 2010 re-issue of these recordings in the super-bargain Sony Masters series.<br />So far as I can tell, they have not been remastered since the original 1997 RCA issue.<br /><br />Janos Starker was born in 1924 in Budapest, Hungary. Two of his older brothers perished in the Nazi holocaust, and he himself was interned. A child prodigy, he made his debut aged 11, and caused a sensation when he played the Dvorak concerto aged 14, standing in at short notice for an indisposed soloist. After the War, he went to America at the invitation of Antal Dorati, and was first cello in several prominent orchestras there before branching out as a chamber player [with Joseph Suk and Julius Katchen] in 1951, and as a soloist and teacher. He became an American citizen, and was widely recognised as one of the greatest cellists of his generation. He recorded virtually all the great works of the cello repertoire, many of them several times. He has always been closely associated with the Kodaly sonata for solo cello.<br /><br />Starker has made five sets of recordings of the Bach suites, the pinnacle of the cello repertoire, though only three have been widely available. These are the early 1950s set for Period [just suites 1,3,4 & 6], issued on LP in the UK by Nixa and re-issued by Saga; the mid-60s set for Mercury; and this version for RCA. [In addition, there was a late 1950s EMI set (1, 2, 3 & 5 in mono: 4 & 6 were recorded in stereo, but appear only in mono in a recent French EMI set), and a 1984 digital set for Sefal.]<br /><br />This set, his last, was apparently recorded in 1992, but not released until 1997, originally by RCA. In its present incarnation, it represents astonishing value for money, despite the lack of any notes about the artist or the music. His playing has gained an added nobility and patrician grandeur with the passage of time; and though his earlier recordings - especially the 1963-5 Mercury cycle - may display more fleet-footed energy and excitement, none of them seems to be currently available. In some ways the Mercury cycle may have the edge for its combination of technical brilliance and sheer musicality. Sadly, in its 1992 CD remastering, it was pitched almost a semitone sharp; and though this was corrected for the 2004 Hybrid CD/SACD re-issue, that set is currently unavailable [except as part of a 50CD set of classic Mercury Living Presence recordings].<br /><br />No-one who loves Starker's playing of these incredible works should hesitate for a moment to acquire this very special, technically excellent recording, particularly at this bargain price. If and when the Mercury set, properly pitched, becomes separately available again, that too should be acquired. In the meantime, no-one should feel short-changed by these well-recorded, golden and glorious performances. They represent the crowning achievement of his life and work.nd excitement, none of them seems to be currently available.

0553582038|4.0|After reading the 3rd book in the series, \\"A Storm of Swords\\" I was disappointed at how many main characters were killed off - some seemingly needlessly and with little reason. \\"A Feast for Crows\\" remedies this and tells a great story in the process.    The POV characters have changed a little but we get a fresh and interesting view on events of the world from these characters and - no major ones are killed off! Yay! I really think Martin must have realized he was on a course for pure disaster if he would have continued in that manner. OK, so enough about that....    The 4th book is a \\"split\\" of an originally much larger book. You will only encounter certain characters and wonder what all of the others are up to. Not to worry , they will all get their say in book 5. Although this may seem frustrating to some readers, I found it to be a good decision. It allows the reader to focus more on the characters presented here and really learn more about this specific group.     For example, you get to learn more about the goings-on in Dorne - an area only marginally mentioned previously. You get to see another side to Samwell Tarly that I really enjoyed. His character has grown and changed and I really like where I perceive him to be headed. Arya Stark also has changed in a very different way - extremely interesting - it is almost as if she is seeing the world through fresh eyes and in new ways that she never thought she would. I love that her learning experiences are so intense - her character is great.     The Greyjoys - pure awesomeness in this book. One of my favorite viewpoints. You get to see a true sea-faring clan at its best. All I can see is beware for the kraken's tentacle is about to wrap itself around the lands of Westeros and pull it down kicking and screaming! One of the most overlooked yet most interesting plot lines in my opinion. Euron Greyjoy is a truly fearsome pirate if there ever was one!    But I must say, the character whose story is the absolute mostawesome, gripping, amazing story in this book is - are you ready? - CERSEI !!  She has undergone a big change to me. She has gone from being just mean and vindictive queen to outright, flat-out, psychotic, obsessive craziness. And I love it! You'll have to read it for yourself to believe it! Her story is pure genius by Martin. I can't help it - she's just SO damn evil! :)    As long as you can read the book and enjoy it for what it is, you will be fine. Go into it knowing that it is a \\"split\\" of a much larger mega-book that Martin had originally planned and you will see why he did what he did. It just would not have been fair to all of the characters. Don't worry - you'll find out what is happening to the other characters soon enough - Martin even says as much near the back of the book!    Here is something very, very odd about the printing of the book itself - somewhere around page 565 I believe, the pages are completely out of order for about 10 pages. It jumps from 565 to 575 to 567 or some such thing. Very, very strange - poor editing perhaps? Or maybe trying to make one too many revisions before going to press?    Overall, A Feast for Crows continues the bold, rich story that you have grown to love, just from a certain select few characters.

0439023483|1.0|Im not gonna go into ripped off ideas, too brutal/not brutal enough diatribes, missed oppertunities, or my complete disregard for the world in which the characters live. All these complaints have been brought forth by many others. My main beef with this boring, unapologetically straight forward, blunt, predictable, uninspired, trite, prose-less, laughably unoriginal drek is the writing style.     Yes, Suzanne Collins has typed an entire book onto page, yes. I give her a hi-5 because I have never written a book. From there on in this book is one very simple character's view point pooped onto 200-some pages with no style, flair, intuition, love or respect for either the characters, the world they inhabit or the readers.     Example: Katniss lives in a town. They mine coal. She hunts for food, which is illegal. They are all very hungry. The Government is very bad and pits children against each other for sport. Then they go to a city. The city is bright and shiny. etc.    You are told what is happing and that is all. Is her town big? Small? How many people? There are rich and poor but do they live in different places? Is it 50% rich/poor? 20%/80%? Are there seasons and are they mild or do they change greatly? What's to stop people from leaving? Does Katniss' family live in a shack or are there multiple rooms? What kind of trees is she hunting amongst? Is it a mountainous area or just rocky? There is nothing except a moment by moment telling with little to no style, metaphor, numbers, measurement, nothing.     Any suspense is squashed by Katniss being dim and overall without intuition. It's like she has Asperger syndrome. I get that all she's done with her life is be gloomy and hunt game so the nuance of how to read people might be very alien to her. Once again however, the book just dictates terms, whether it be discerning romance or building a fire.    (SPOILERS! SORT OF! SPOILERS)    You as a reader, unless you've never read a book ever, know from page 25 that Katnissand her partner for the games are going to become romantically entangled. The book just tells you that. You never doubt for a second that he loves Katniss beacuse the book FORCES the conclusion on you. Now if he'd turned on her, that would have been a surprise. But no, what the book suggests moves along and happens just as you'd expect.     Now Im trying my best not to be a sci-fi elitest. Good books have been written in such a style, but they either have beautiful prose and imagry (100 years of solitude, any Steinbeck, Kafka on the Shore) or have socitial/cultural/political/mental boundries that shape the style of the book that way (American Psycho, 1984, any Palaniuk) but this book is wholly relying on some stuff that happened once and is told to you in this really straight forward blunt english. I know this is written for a younger audience, but does that mean you have so little respect for your audience's intelligence that \\"Cornucopia\\" is the biggest word in the book? Boring and kinda offensive.    In any case, I was aghast that instead of getting to meet ANY of the participents Katniss is up against, all you get is vague descriptions of a few of the kids. \\"Boy with a limp\\", \\"Tallest boy\\", \\"Sexy girl\\", \\"Fox Face\\", etc. You are about to be tasked with killing 23 people and you're not going to even get their NAMES? Sure, you're gonna have to kill them, Im not saying you gotta be buddies, but know SOMETHING about them! Instead the book turns into \\"11 or so die in first hour, some stuff happens, nameless person dies, stuff happens, 2 more nameless automatons die, Katniss's makes a friend, some girl from District 8 dies, blah blah blah. Wow! I wish I gave a damn about anyone in this book but I dont.     Forced love triangles, hollow nameless unintimidating villians and not a paragraphs worth of descriptive detail all totaled together makes this a really dull read. I finished, but only because it was too simple not to finish. I wanted to hold out hope for a cool ending or anything reedemable but nope. The ending sucked too.    Gave the book away. Won't touch sequels.
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|I am not well conversant with this genre of music or Jackson's total repertoire.<br />However I have a feeling, this can very much be treated as a synopsis of his brilliant musical works.<br />It has wide variation in the content, mood, treatment, tempo and composition.<br />The title aptly sums it up.<br />I feel anyone who wants to know this raw genius, can start with it.<br />An original and outstanding work.

B00049QQHI|3.0|This strengths of the movie are:  competent acting by DeCaprio and a socially useful message:  drugs ruin dreams and lives.    In the movie, DeCaprio is not a bad basketball player; he has plenty of coordination.  However,  he is not even close to the type of high school athlete who in real life would be in line for a college scholarship.  He lacks the necessary muscle mass and skill development to even be considered for that level.  So the way the movie ends up looking:  the \\"dream\\" of being a college player (or beyond) was only in his mind.  Bad casting.  He's a fine actor but this was not the right role for him.    The scenes take place without much development so that the movie has more of a comic book feel than a serious movie.
B0057IS6K6|5.0|Well, I took my family to see Kung Fu Panda 2, and we all thought it was at least as good as the first film. It is engrossing, touching, clever, and much of the time absolutely hilarious. We had seen that the critics all panned it, and had high hopes because they are quite often wrong. Of course, it depends on how you judge these things. A lot of the surprise element is inevitably lost now that we know Po is, indeed, the Dragon Warrior in spite of his ungainly appearance and humble behaviour. And it must have been hard for the director and scriptwriters to define his new status vis a vis Shifu and the Furious Five. Furthermore - as a lot of comments here have pointed out - how on earth could they follow an act as supremely vicious and powerful as Ian McShane's Tai Lung?<br /><br />All those problems are resolved in Kung Fu Panda 2 - and, I think, very satisfactorily indeed. The main dramatic engine is, of course, the villain, and Gary Oldman's rendering of the peacock Lord Shen is right up there with McShane's performance as Tai Lung. True, the peacock is not a supreme Kung Fu fighter - although he is pretty good - but he over-compensates for that by introducing mechanisation. Cleverly exploiting the fact that gunpowder and fireworks were first invented in China, the writers conceive the happy idea of making Shen set up a full-fledged production line devoted to turning out huge cannon. As Shifu and others explain, Shen's artillery has the potential to overthrow Kung Fu for once and for all - so Po and the Furious Five are fighting, not just for themselves, their friends, and the people of a conquered city, but to maintain the supremacy of their religion and their way of life. Necessarily - because cannon do not make or haul themselves - Shen commands a sizeable army of wolves and gorillas (which appear to have flat-top haircuts suggestive of the US military). So, although personally less scary than Tai Lung, he is a far more formidable enemy.<br /><br />Within the constraints of a 91-minute film, an incredible amount of action takes place. After an efficient scene-setting, in which we see Shen's falling-out with his parents and his determination to seek revenge even beyond the grave, Po and the Five are dispatched by Shifu to deal with Shen and his miscellaneous artifacts and henchthings. Meanwhile, Po reflects (in his copious free time) on the task Shifu has set him: to seek \\"Inner Peace\\". Hugely outnumbered, at a great disadvantage because of Shen's artillery, and even out-thought by the wily bird, the friends seem to be up against it. But, needless to say, at the exactly perfect moment everything comes together for Po... Meanwhile the jokes come thick and fast - although you will perhaps find the film more amusing if you enjoy running gags, of which there are plenty.<br /><br />It is certainly true that Kung Fu Panda 2 is darker, and there is mention of death. Indeed, it is central to the psychological aspect of the plot, as Po finds out more about where he came from and his parents. However, I noticed that the almost-empty cinema contained several small children - one little girl of perhaps five was sitting directly behind us with her father - and I didn't see any evidence of fear or unhappiness. Indeed, the tiny child behind us was volubly enthusiastic at the end, telling her father what a wonderful movie it had been and how much she enjoyed it. I think you have to give DreamWorks credit for knowing what people of all ages like and don't like. For all but determined critics, then, I think you will find Kung Fu Panda 2 a worthy sequel and perhaps, in some ways, even better than the first.91-minute film, an incredible amount of action takes place.

B00005JKGK|1.0|When I read the book I thought it was racist but I was just barely able to enjoy it because the writing quality was good. This just went above and beyond. If I were Tan's parents I would be ashamed to call her a daughter and she doesn't deserve to be called an Asian. Some clear examples of how this was even more racist then the book which was already pretty racist are included below.<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br />In the book the jerk who wanted to split everything was clearly white yet in the movie they made him Asian. Also in the book the woman leaves her husband who cheats on her, in the movie they reconcile.<br />*End Spoilers*
B007SPPANM|5.0|It's been a long time since I've watched this movie from beginning to end, so I decided to refresh my memory. I forgot how great and sad this film is. It has great characters that we come to love, and a powerful forbidden love storyline. In 1996, Brock Lovett and his team explore the Titanic wreckage in search for a necklace called the Heart of the Ocean. Instead, they find a nude drawing of a woman named Rose, who was wearing the necklace the night Titanic sank. Rose is now an elderly lady, and tells Brock and his team her story aboard the Titanic.<br /><br />In 1912, teen-aged Rose is a first-class passenger, and going to England with her fianc&eacute; Cal. Meanwhile, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson wins a ticket aboard the Titanic. When Rose wants to commit suicide, Jack talks her out of it, and they soon start a relationship, defying Cal and her mom. Soon, Titanic hits the iceberg and slowly begins to sink. Every passing minute, Jack and Rose try to find a way off the doomed ship together or not at all. If you're a history buff and want a smart love story, you'll love TITANIC!!!

B004KPLVW2|5.0|This is a classic movie that was ahead of the time. Regardless of how it stands up to the action of Tron Legacy, this movie is a must see so at least you'll know what the story line is. But, my review is for the the blu-ray transfer only. This movie got a HUGE upgrade in looks with this transfer. I had a VHS copy of this so as you can imagine, I was amazed. The colors are so brilliant and the images are so crisp that this movie looks as if it was made today. I mean it! The movie is fun to watch because of this vast improvement. It doesn't feel old. You know what I mean? And the sound is incredible too! If you like Tron, you have to get this!
B00408MS5S|5.0|Supertramp's sixth album entitled Breakfast in America was a perfect example of the classic Dickens quote \\"it was the best of times and it was the worst of times\\" end quote.<br />When it was released in March of 1979, the album was embraced heavily in the United States as the group had just come off the heels of their first Gold selling album with Even in the Quietest Moments, which was released in April, 1977 (Crime of the Century went Gold shortly after Even in the Quietest Monents went Gold).<br />Breakfast in America had three Top 20 hits guitarist/singer/keyboard player Roger Hodgson's \\"The Logical Song\\" (a Top 10 hit hitting #6 in the spring of 1979) and \\"Take the Long Way Home\\" (which was the band's second and last US Top 10 hit as it peaked at #10 that December).<br />Plus, keyboard player and singer Rick Davies' \\"Goodbye Stranger\\" (which was the band's second Top 20 US hit peaking at #19 that summer).<br />Other standouts on this classic are Davies' haunting opener \\"Gone Hollywood\\", which was a third person's view on the negativity of living in L.A., \\"Just Another Nervous Wreck\\" and \\"Oh Darling\\" (both also written by Davies). I also loved Hodgson's \\"Lord is it Mine\\".<br />Despite the fact that it's musically and lyrically a fun, warm and happy album, tensions between Hodgson and Davies were increasing during the recording sessions of this album.<br />The title track to Breakfast in America Roger had written when he was 19 but Rick despised it and didn't want the song on the album. He also didn't want the album titled Breakfast in America neither, Roger won out on both counts.<br />\\"Casual Conversations\\" was seen as Rick's stab at Roger and the closing \\"Child of Vision\\" was Roger's equivalent to Gone Hollywood and veiled attack to Rick with Rick surprisingly adding in his responses to Roger's accusations and featured a stellar piano workout from Rick and a burning tenor sax solo at the end of the track by saxophonist John Helliwell whom is arguably the best sax player in rock in my view.<br />Despite all the turmoil, Breakfast in America hit #1 in the US (as well as Europe, Canada, Norway and Australia) and sold over 4 million copies in America (18 million worldwide).<br />Hodgson felt that Supertramp should have ended with Breakfast in America instead of 1982's follow-up Famous Last Words although some fans disagree (like me) with his sentiments.<br />Over 30 years on, Breakfast still holds up musically today.<br />The remastered version of Breakfast which was released in June of 2002 has better sound quality that buries either the original CD or the Mobile Fidelity version.<br />In 2010, a Deluxe Edition was released with a bonus live disc which includes tracks excluded from the 1980 live album Paris which were recorded during those sessions out of a barn burning \\"Goodbye Stranger\\", a sublime \\"Even In the Quietest Moments\\", a stellar \\"Give a Little Bit\\", a nice \\"Downstream\\", the rollicking \\"Another Man's Woman\\" and a kick*ss version of \\"Child of Vision\\". Another Breakfast track \\"Oh Darling\\" is take from Miami during the US leg and the tracks \\"The Logical Song\\", \\"Breakfast in America\\", \\"Rudy\\" and \\"From Now On\\" are great live performances all recorded either in Miami OR London during the Breakfast in America Tour of 1979. Plus it comes with a stellar book featuring interviews, lyrics, original credits and the remaster is excellent!<br />Highly recommended!my view.

B0042U2HN2|5.0|There are many superb works and musicians documented in this box. You get the violins sonatas with Szeryng, piano trios with Szeryng and Fournier, the cello sonatas with Piatigorsky, and the piano quartets and the quintet with the Guarneri. Overall the performances are excellent. I particularly enjoyed the violin sonatas and the piano trios.  You also get the two piano concertos in good performances and a selection from the solo piano works. This box would make a beautiful introduction to the piano chamber work of Brahms at very affordable prices. If you are not familiar with Rubinstein, Szeryng, and Fournier it is likely to make you listen to a lot more of their recordings.

1400079144|2.0|Dan Brown can come up with a decent storyline, but he is an absolutely horrid writer! An example of his awfulness (I could have chosen many) is a scene where a blind minister lectures someone about how now that he is blind he truly sees. Ugh. The book is full of this and many other hackneyed stock high school writing devices.  But, I would be lying if I said that the book was not a page turner. It certainly is that.<br />One strength of \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is that for most of the novel it does not try to take itself as seriously as the stupid \\"DaVinci Code\\", although the last 100 pages get way too didactic for my tastes. This text is also less antagonistic to the church and Christianity than Mr. Brown's previous two Robert Langdon novels.<br />The villain of the piece leaves a lot to be desired, and his storyline is pure comic book, but if you put that aspect of it aside you can enjoy the ridiculousness of his villainy. Plus, there is a nice plot twist concerning the villain that I did not see coming, but yet if you go back and read a little closer Brown does a nice job of dropping subtle hints all along.<br />Another quibble I have is that the book is about 100 pages too long because Brown gets very preachy and heavy handed with his Masonic lessons, and because he allows almost every character in the text to pontificate at some point or another about ancient wisdom, great secrets, etc. This leads me to my biggest issue with this, and other Dan Brown, novels. It is scary that some readers, and maybe even Mr. Brown himself, forget that this is fiction. Reading some of these reviews and various other materials on the text, there are many people out there who believe this crap about ancient hidden Masonic secrets, noetic science, hidden codes in the Bible, etc. Okay folks, it's cute, it's fun, it makes for good thriller reading, but it is not more than that. Don't take it as such!<br />\\"The Lost Symbol\\" is not serious reading, but I read it in a pool, and it was fine for that.
B0043KK4N6|4.0|Great cd; great music.  Didn't realize case would be broken but could have happened in mail.  Very happy with product.
B004INHTK4|3.0|There are some great moments of humour in this book. Taken literally the author perceives herself a voice of reason in a world of parenting gone mad; a world where children are seen, heard and allowed to fritter away their childhood on having fun.    Her children are subjected to a regime of discipline and learning by rote designed to set them up for academic and musical success. And it works, up to a point.    The book's dynamic comes from the author/mother's division of approaches into Western (lax, pandering, liberal, not fulfilling the potential of the child) and Chinese (authoritarian and relentless in the pursuit of academic and musical success). Her approach is Chinese and her home is in the US, leading to friction with her children, husband, friends and colleagues.    Take it as a parenting manual and its likely to raise annoyance. Take it as the memoir of a woman who has correctly identified that she has adopted an approach many \\"Westerners\\" will find extreme, who tells her story succintly and well and who, between the lines, has an engaging take on self-deprecation and bathos and you'll probably like it.    My favourite quote from the book is...    \\"The summer after Florence's passing was a difficult one. To begin with, I ran over Sophia's foot.    \\"She jumped out of my car to grab a tennis racket while I was still backing up, and her left ankle got caught in the front wheel. Sophia and I both fainted. She ended up having surgery under full anasthesia and two big screws put in.    \\"Then she had to wear a huge boot and use crutches for the rest of the summer, which put her in a bad mood but at least gave her a lot of time to practice the piano.\\"    If that raises a smile, you're probably on to a winner.

1934429376|5.0|Todd Oldham has done a great job of paying tribute to an overlooked legend in the business. Many grew up with his illustrations as a child, and there is something simple/childlike about his illustration and complex at the same time.    This is a huge hardback book with no dust cover. The boards are thicker than normal, probably due to the dimensions of the book. The book is 425 pages and the artwork is lavishly reproduced with no printing issues that I notice. Some images are full bleed and it's just a joy to look through.    The book is divided into the following chapters:    Foreword  Conversation with Charley Harper  Betty Crocker's Dinner for Two Cook Book  The Giant Golden Book of Biology  The Animal Kingdom  Ford Times Magazine  Birds & Words  Advertising & Promotions  Mosaic Murals  Paintings  Posters    It's great this was published in his lifetime and this is a wonderful tribute. Highly recommended.

0307473473|5.0|MMP/SPOILERS: First, let me say that this was a great read. I heard so many good/bad comments about the book & I decided not to read it. Then, I was at a library sale and got an old PB copy for fifty cents & put it on my \\"to read someday pile.\\" Then, I went to the movies. I saw the trailer to the movie with The Immigrant Song, was completely mesmerized, & I decided to try it. After I started it, I couldn't put it down. There is so much to this book. It is a \\"locked door\\" who-done-it with a cast of suspects on a 40 year-old Swedish murder. The book does delve into securities fraud (which is why I didn't want to read it in the first place), but it is focused more in the end which is needed after the brutal roller-coaster ride of the murder mystery.<br /><br />  The story focuses on Lisbeth, a social outcast who has a hint of Asperger's syndrome worst than Reichs' Temperance Brennan. Her life is difficult, but she is extremely intelligent & a computer hacker. Lisbeth is an investigator who sees everything in black/white. She is socially retarded and doesn't get along with too many people. The wears black, has tattoos and piercing, has red hair that she dyes black, and looks pre-puberty. She is 25, but is still a ward of the state and, by law, is required to have a guardian. She hates authority and wouldn't report any crime to the police if her life depended on it. She is a blank emotional slate with self-destructive behavior.<br /><br />  Her life is complicated by Mikael. He is a magazine publisher and has just been convicted of libel, which in Sweden can carry a prison sentence. He is a bad husband and bad father. He is a boy who can't say no when it comes to women. His friend and lover, Berger, is his crutch. When it is all said and done, he will always go back to her. When it comes to work, he is smart and dedicated.<br /><br />  Meanwhile, Vanger, a billionaire is haunted by the disappearance of his niece, Harriet. Someone is spending a great deal of time tormenting him by sending him a mysterious annual present. Vanger hires Mikael to go over the ancient evidence and dangles a carrot that all Mikael's legal problems can go away. Mikael agrees thinking it is easy money & a solution to his legal woes.<br />  This was such a good book. I enjoyed the mystery and the background story. Two percent of the novel, I guessed correctly. The other 98% of the book, I was completely tricked by red herrings and my indecision to figure it out. Stieg Larsson did a great job telling the story.

B001MEJY8W|5.0|Wow. No, I mean WOW.<br /><br />First things first: this is positively THE most graphic, disturbing movie I've ever seen in my life. The way I felt after seeing this film was the way you'd feel after waking up from a particularly vivid nightmare. It felt like, \\"Whoa, did I just see that?\\" The monster in this film is not some deformed creature in the basement, or a supernatural hellish thing coming out after dark, or even a prowling psychopath with a taste for human flesh. The monster is very human, and very normal, and it's in a place you're least likely to find, and its motives are nothing like what you thought.<br /><br />Some people compare this to Hostel. Let me tell you... Hostel doesn't hold a candle to this. Hostel is boring, trashy torture porn. This is a masterpiece that looks deep into the human psyche, and reveals a picture that's both horrifying and intriguing. The first part is a bit predictable, but the second part... Boy oh boy. You think you know where it's going, and then it hits you over the head, makes you wish for a different turn of events, makes you want to look away over and over again, and yet you can't...<br /><br />This is a masterpiece. A gruesome and mind-bending experience, to be sure, but an unforgettable one. Watch it. If you dare.
B002SSUQFG|2.0|I pride myself in making the time to thoroughly review on-line purchases to ensure that I'm aware of what I'm buying, know the best price, plus don't waste time with product returns, but this purchase is going back. I had read the reviews from other buyers indicating that the watch occasionally lost a \\"few minutes\\" of time, but I minimized and rationalized those concerns as being from hard-to-please customers. Prior to this purchase, I have never owned a mechanical watch or one that I've had to start. I've only owned this watch for a few weeks, but my experience has been that while the watch looks great (outdoorish, military, manly-appearance), it's totally worthless when it comes to keeping time. When I would take it off at night, it would literally lose hours of time and would need to be reset each morning. No matter how good it looks, who has use, or time, for a watch that needs to be reset on a daily basis. I like the appearance of the watch enough that really want to believe that maybe I just bought a defective one and I won't have this problem with the next one, but am extremely reluctant to take that chance. As a fellow informed consumer, my recommendation to anyone considering purchasing this particular watch would be to ensure that you're aware of the return policy and shipping costs prior to purchasing so that you're able to send it back to the seller without too much hassle.
B00005OM4N|2.0|I've been a Britney fan since 1999 and have followed her all the way until her newest album (Femme Fatale). I still do not own Femme Fatale, but own every other album of hers and this one is, by far, her worst. There's some catchy tracks but for the most part, the album flops for me. So many of the songs feel like filler songs and are easily disposable (Anticipating, I Love Rock 'N Roll, Let Me Be, What It's Like To Be Me).    The songs that stand out for me are I'm A Slave 4 U, Overprotected, Lonely, Cinderella, and Bombastic Love. The rest fall in that \\"they're okay\\" category for me.    I'm A Slave 4 U - a good start for the album and a different, new sound that suits Britney. 9/10    Overprotected - good, pop song with a killer beat. 8/10    Lonely - one of my favorites off the album bummed it wasn't released as a single. 9/10    I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman - typical Britney-esque ballad, but still catchy. 7/10    Boys - boring and her vocals aren't that great, had the potential to be better. 5/10    Anticipating - easily the worst song on the album for me and, possibly, the worst song of her career (to my ears). 0/10    I Love Rock 'N Roll - terrible attempt at a classic cover. 1/10    Cinderella - the best song on the album! It's so catchy and dramatic. I love it! 10/10    Let Me Be - another boring filler song. 3/10    Bombastic Love - for some reason, I LOVE this song but wish it was a little longer. 8/10    That's Where You Take Me - a sweet, simple ballad. 6/10    What It's Like To Be Me - an easily disposable track. The album would have sounded better ending with \\"That's Where You Take Me.\\" 4/10

B003UESJF6|4.0|Wow, I finally got to watch this!  Big hit back in 2010, director Tom McGrath (Madagascar) comes out with another hit for Dreamworks.<br /><br />I really liked the animation, quite realistic.  The story starts with Megamind and Metroman, battling it out.  The thing is they've been doing this for so many years and having the same outcomes, that both are getting quite bored with the whole thing.<br /><br />When Metroman disappears, apparently destroyed by Megamind, the big blue head has trouble adjusting.  When he starts falling for the girl, things really get interesting.  The puns and parodies, like Megamind's constantly mispronouncing words, always getting it wrong, was fun but a bit overdone.<br /><br />Megamind also wants to make a hero so he can battle him and get back some of the good old days.  Unfortunately this backfires, with the former nerdy cameraman becoming Titan (or as he spells it, \\"Tighten\\") the new super villain.<br /><br />How will Megamind adjust to being a super hero?  He's not supposed to win or get the girl.  What is up with that?  And having a Marlon Brando knock-off was frankly hilarious.<br /><br />Themes:<br /><br />I really liked the theme of becoming more than you really are and being willing to make big changes in your life.  Megamind had a lot of hard choices to make.  And Roxie, the girl from Channel 8 (a clear homage to Lois Lane from the Superman comics) realizes she's been judging a book by its cover rather than seeing what lies behind it.<br /><br />DVD:<br /><br />I really liked the \\"making of\\" segment with Wil Ferrell, Tina Fey and others talking about the film and how much fun they had making it.  There are also the usual previews and advertisements on the DVD as well.  Listen to another rendition of \\"Move It\\" from Madagascar!<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Quite enjoyable homage, almost a parody in some scenes, and I think will be enjoyable, especially to comic book fans or those familiar with Superman's origins.  The movie does run out of gas in the second third of the film.  I felt the producers spent too much time on Megamind's depression rather than having some more action.<br /><br />Overall, recommended!spent too much time on Megamind's depression rather than having some more action.     Overall, recommended!

I had a hard time putting this game down, but when I did and tried to restart the program on my Evo, it would sometimes take over a minute to actually get to the menu. Sometimes the force close window would come up and then go away, but eventually the game always starts. Even with the screen full of zombies, the game runs very smoothly, and the bosses are fun to take down. I wish the game was longer, but survival mode extends the life of the game a bit. Very solid game.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|\\"The Book Thief\\" is a masterfully crafted beautiful collection of words that form a heart crushing story. Markus Zusak certainly does have a talent for words and what an amazing story! I was reduced to tears several times in this novel, but who wouldn't be in  coming of age tale set in Nazi Germany? I promise, some of the pages must be stained with tears.<br /> I remember as a very young girl one of the most heart wrenching novels I read was, \\"The Diary Of Anne Frank\\" and while I realize \\"The Book Thief\\" is historical fiction, it  still represents a terrible tragedy that engulfed our world for a period in history. The book is so emotional because not only did I feel for the characters but I was continuously reminded that people actually did suffer these injustices and there were in fact people in existence evil enough to hand it out.<br /> There is not one boring moment in the entire novel. Every story within the bigger story has a point. Liesel is an orphaned girl growing up in Nazi Germany. She forms many relationships and Zusak really help the reader feel connected to every single character he introduces. Leisel begins by stealing a book from a graveside and the entire novel is packed with clever connections to Leisel's tormented relationship with words.<br /> Brilliantly, Mark Zusak found his voice in this novel through Death, the broken tired soul collector who is surprised to find interest in a nine year old book thief, who narrates the novel. This approach was very clever especially when dealing with Nazi Germany. Death had eloquent lines about picking tired souls up and carrying them in his arms. So tender, so unlike our dark and grim pictures of death.<br /> Zusak even managed to create and include a fairy tale, or fable, that had my eyes swelling with tears. Max's book within a book was another great idea...but I could go on and on forever about Zusak's wonderful talents. I could write pages and pages but somehow I will contain myself.<br /> One of the most touching relationships in the book is the one I see Liesel form with Mama. I know this is slightly shocking as Papa is the more obvious choice, and believe me I felt for him too. But unlike Papa, I really saw Liesel turn her opinion of Mama into an intense love that she realized was equally reciprocated. I think Liesel was more like Mama then should would have wanted to be.<br /> \\"The Book Thief\\" should be on everyone's reading list. Regardless of age, this is a novel that everyone should pick up. I love that through every experience Liesel manages to trudge through she always realizes the power of words and I feel like that is what Zusak has given us. We must never forget the tragedies that occurred in this world, if only so that we many strive to be better and never repeat past mistakes.tionships in the book is the one I see Liesel form with Mama.

1416562605|2.0|I wanted to read this novel because I had heard that it is about the poors' struggle in India. I know from personal experience how the well-to-do treat those at the bottom in India, and elsewhere. So, my expectation was that the writer would take a fair position and speak for those whose voice barely gets heard. He does that to a certain extent. The irony is: he does not seem to have escaped the vicious cycle of humiliation and subordination. What I mean is, he seems to buy the stereotypes that exist in society against certain people, rather than attempting to question them. I don't understand why he picks Nepali characters to stand in for \\"guards\\" and \\"prostitutes\\" in Delhi, and gives the impression that Nepal (or Russia) exports only these people to India, and nothing good. This is not only his problem, though. Kiran Desai does the same in \\"The Inheritance of Loss,\\" Bharati Mukherjee in \\"Jasmine,\\" going all the way back to Nehru in \\"The Discovery of India,\\" even though Nehru is more sensitive in his representation than Adiga and his ilk.<br /><br />If you want to speak for the under-represented, then better look at Ngugi's \\"Devil on the Cross,\\" or Achebe's \\"Things Fall Apart.\\" You can do so without degrading and humiliating other peoples or cultures. The only reason I gave it two stars is because its prose is rich and the narrative technique is novel. I was hoping to read this novel in one of my undergraduate classes, but now I am very hesitant. But, I will not bother to read another work by this writer for sure.

However, within about two or three weeks of receiving this item, the speakers began to die out-- and did so very quickly.

B000N7KTBU|5.0|Already had one, and just bought two more - one for my daughter, and another one for myself. This is a much more economical way of getting a good external/backup drive for your important files.  Additionally, these enclosures are designed to work in conjunction with a free software package that you can download from the manufacturer's site. That software allows you to turn the drive into a one-touch backup device using the button on the front of the enclosure.  My youngest daughter is about to go off to college, and I set this up on her laptop with the software and am very satisfied that she now has a simple and reliable method to keep her data safe.<br /><br />My first one is about a year old, and I recently bent the connecting USB cable (which is why I bought this second one for myself), but I have used it almost daily for keeping and transferring files from one computer and location to another.  I highly recommend it.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|As Susan Tedeschi somehow rose from her roots in Martha's Vineyard to become one of the best modern blues singers, I often wished she would team up with another artist who could provide more depth on guitars. Not that her band wasn't adequate on guitars, but a little more just might launch her major label career. At the rate Jonny Lang was going, I was sure he would blow out his voice early on. Seemed like he was straining too hard to get the \\"authentic\\" blues sound. That seemed to be an idyllic combination, just waiting to happen. Tedeschi's husband, Derek Trucks, was gaining popularity, bouncing between a few smaller labels, then onto Sony records. As a carry over from when Columbia owned the label, only the best recordings were issued on Masterworks. Sony kept that tradition alive, releasing the efforts of Tedeschi's and Trucks' combined bands on Sony Masterworks. The album definitely holds up to the expectations I had of the Masterworks label. The instrumentation is expertly crafted. Vocals, primarily by Tedeschi with harmonies where appropriate, fit the music perfectly. If you have no albums by either group, this would be a fantastic introduction to expertly crafted modern blues.

B002SJIO5E|5.0|Combining two genres that previously, I never thought of blending, socially-consciens and alien lifeforms, \\"District 9\\" brilliantly brings to life a gripping tale that is very realistic, but also heartbreaking all in one.<br /><br /> Featuring relatively unknown actors, \\"District 9\\" takes place in Johannesburgh, South Africa, where the legacy of Apartheid lingers on across every sector of the nation's societies, regardless of wealth or race. A large alien spacecraft parks itself above the city's skyline, and hovers over the place for many years, doing virtually nothing. To the dismay, amazement but also fear of the citizenry, a large colony of alien lifeforms, who exhibit sentience, find themselves stranded on Earth.<br /><br /> Due to fear gripping the city, the alien lifeforms are herded into slum villages with one becoming known as District 9.<br /><br /> This is a marvelous movie and one I highly recommend.

B00005CCA9|3.0|I admit right away that Martha Argerich - just like Cherkassky, Pogorelich or Richter - is one those a piano mavericks about whose artistry I have never much cared. However, this is not to say that I don't admire these great artists. Indeed I do, for everybody who has the courage to be so tremendously personal at the keyboard deserves a great deal of admiration. In general I would gladly give Martha five full stars for that alone, for example to her great [[ASIN:B000001GQJ Debut Recital]] (including the wild Liszt Sonata which is NOT part of this recital but was coupled with it on the DG Originals series). As Harold Schonberg put it, her playing may be undisciplined from time to time, but it is always of interest. Strangely enough, this is not at all the case with this recording, especially not with Rachmaninoff's Third Concerto.    To begin with, the performance is nowhere near as spectacular enough, purely technically, as many people may lead you believe. With but few exceptions, Martha is not at all faster than the young Horowitz or Rachmaninoff himself - and yes, in the exceptions, such as the notoriously rushed opening of the third movement, she is too fast and distinctly less musical than pretty much anybody else; if you agree with the eminent Rachmaninoff scholar Barrie Martyn that this opening has no melodic significance, you may like the rush, but I don't. In fact, there are far too many passages (including the first movement cadenza and almost the whole second movement) where Martha is positively sloppy, if not technically, at all events musically. Besides, to equal virtuosity with speed is a very superficial notion. Martha may have very deft fingers, but she certainly lacks brilliance and bravura: her sonority is just as colourless and limited as the muffled and distant orchestra under the timid and cautious baton of Chailly. How much of it is live remains obscure and the early digital sound (1982) is quite a bit subpar, but these are both totally irrelevant matters. The recording is, above all, artistically flawed.    In short, interesting performance but, in comparison with others, perfectly dull almost all the time. If you want real virtuosity coupled with superior and really original artistry, like it or not it doesn's matter, there are Horowitz in any of his three official recordings (1930 with Coates, 1951 with Reiner, and 1978 with Ormandy, live), the blistering performance of Jorge Bolet in the Indiana University (1969, also live) or, of course, the powerful rendition of Rachmaninoff himself (with Ormandy, 1939-40) which completely transcends whatever sonic shortcomings the recording may have. If you are keen on more musical and less dashing approaches, there are Bolet's late recording for DECCA (1982, with Ivan Fischer) or Ashkenazy with Fistoulari (1963) or Previn (1970-71) for the same label. Interestingly, all of these recordings but the last one include the less difficult cadenza, which is also the one used by Martha here. Yet, neither here nor anywhere else does she do anything memorable enough to put her in the exalted company of the aforementioned artists. Nor does Chailly, for that matter.    The Second Suite for two pianos fares much better, though this is doubtless due to the fact that it is much less popular and hence less frequently recorded. Nevertheless, Marta and Nelson (Freier) are a most interesting alternative to the rather more restrained (in the best sense of the word) Ashkenazy/Previn duo. This recording is the same that is coupled with Ravel and Lutoslawski on this CD from PHILIP's The Originals series that has a cover with which every hard rock band would be proud, showing Marta and Nelson in the company of strong light and cigarette smoke, standing against each other, as well as against the concert grand, and ready to fight. Judging by Rachmaninoff's Second Suite, the [[ASIN:B000PMFTEA disc]] is well worth hearing and I don't mind telling you that it is this recording which contributes most to the three-star rating. Martha's Third Concerto will hardly bear repeated listening.    P. S. By the way, the booklet contains a simply disgustingly purple ''essay'' by Bryce Morrison who is so amazingly over the top and wide of the mark that I am astonished that his crap was published at all.
0316069353|5.0|Although The Fifth Witness isn't in the masterpiece category of the first Haller novel The Lincoln Lawyer it's easily the best sequel of the four novel (so far) series. It works because it's unlike the former two sequels it's not trying to satisfy Harry Bosch fans by including him, except for a paragraph or two where he makes a cameo appearance at a party.  Sure I like Bosch novels too, but when I pick up a Haller novel, it's because that's the character I want to read about, and that's what we get in The Fifth Witness, which is a good old court room based for the most part novel, where Mickey Haller must outwit and out play the prosecution, with the help of his legal practice staff some such as his driver and Cisco, his main research man, coming from unconventional backgrounds.<br /><br />This time round, Haller's up against a prosecutor and police force who seemed to have put blinders on, in their rush for finding and putting away their suspect just to save tight budget money. They believe without a doubt that Lisa Trammel is guilty of murder. She's already a client of Mickey's due to his representing her in a house repossession scheme against the very bank where the CEO has just been murdered in the car park. Although Mickey doesn't initially believe in her innocence either (he's not going to ask her as that's irrelevant to his job), he can't go along with the house being repossessed argument the prosecution are relying on for motive, as he knows he was about to expose fraudulent practices going on within the bank in the other upcoming trial and it was a slam dunk that Lisa would have been keeping her house for at least a few years to come.  Both Lisa and the bank knew this, as he'd informed the bank hoping to avoid that trial with a favourable compromise with for his client.  Lisa is also adamant that she has been framed by the mortgage industry due to the fact she is the spokeswoman for a protest group of thousands of other people in the same situation as herself.  As Haller starts to build her defence and has a run in with some thugs warning him to back off, it's looking more and more like she's onto something, and there's a more obvious but potentially politically troublesome company that the police seemed to have ignored completely, which has a bigger motive and should have been the main suspect all along.<br /><br />Although it's not the masterpiece that the Lincoln Lawyer is, The Fifth Witness is still a great high quality can't put down read.  The only thing I thought was a bit out of place was the inconsistency of Haller's daughter's age.  At the start Hayley's so young she doesn't understand about mortgages and banks repossessing houses, and needs her father to explain it in very simple analogies comparing mortgages and repossession with things a little girl would be familiar. However later in the book in a minor scene, she's acting like a teenager demanding both parents stay out of her room and is doing advanced algebra.  Surely if she's old enough to act like this and do complicated mathematical exercises, she's going to understand what a mortgage and a house being repossessed is.  This very minor inconsistent daughter age thing though doesn't interrupt the flow of the story though, or affect it's extremely high quality, it's just something where an editor maybe is too scared to do their job due to how big a name their author is.  The Fifth Witness is a great read, one that fans of the original Lincoln Lawyer aren't going to want to put down once they've started.Haller starts to build her defence and has a run in with some thugs warning him to back off, it's looking more and more like she's onto something, and there's a more obvious but potentially politically troublesome company that the police seemed to have ignored completely, which has a bigger motive and should have been the main suspect all along.

B00001IVQT|4.0|I have never heard Ashkenazy's digital recordings of Rachmaninoff's concerti with Haitink, but I have certainly heard the [[ASIN:B00000427L ones]] with Andre Previn quite a few times. To cut the long story short, both the Second and the Third concerto with the same soloist have definitely been better served elsewhere.    Ashkenazy himself is rather consistent and, indeed, considering that these recordings were made in 1963 when he was but 25-26 years old, his playing is quite remarkable and mature. (As a matter of fact, however, the remakes with Previn were recorded only seven or eight years later, in 1970-71.) This Third Concerto is actually even preferable to the later recording, for here Ashkenazy chooses the easier cadenza in the first movement, whereas in the recording with Previn his rendition of the more impressive cadenza sounds a bit laboured.     The conducting and the sound are what, for me, downgrade this recording to four stars. Both are fine and both are inferior to the later remakes. Kondrashin and Fistoulari are dependable fellows, but neither of them is any match for Previn in terms of sonority, dynamic range or clarity of detail. DECCA should have done a better job, too. The sound is a little brittle and harsh, occasionally with some rather jarring climaxes or high notes on the piano. Considering that DECCA were one of the pioneers of the stereo, and that in the early 1960s (and even in the late 1950s) they recorded Karajan and the Wiener Philharnoniker as sumptuously as never before or since, the sonics here are distinctly inferior, even for their own time.    That said, the recording is well worth having for there is a great deal to enjoy here. But if you already know these marvellous works with Ashkenazy and Previn, you may as well be prepared that neither the sound nor the orchestras are on the same level here. But since both are serviceable, and Ashkenazy as great as always, the disc is worth having, especially considering the low price. And if you have never heard Vladimir Ashkenazy playing these works, this is an excellent introduction to his impersonal yet unique vision of Rachmaninoff. The indifferent liner notes by Bryce Morrison you may skip without fear of missing anything of any importance.

B004SUDPXW|5.0|The third season of \\"Breaking Bad\\" doesn't take any half measures. Much like the first two seasons the taunt, suspenseful series continues to built towards a fiery conclusion for Walt (Bryan Cranston) and Jesse (Aaron Paul) who have moved up in the world from crystal meth makers for low level crazy drug kingpin Tuco to working for the biggest distributor (Giancarlo Esposito) of drugs in the lower half of the U.S. Both Walt and Jesse find themselves in the crosshairs of Tuco's enforcer cousins and all those around them may become nothing more than collateral damage if someone doesn't stop them.<br /><br />As with the previous two seasons Emmy winners Cranston and Paul are only the tip of the superb acting iceberg with Anna Gun, Dean Norris, Betsy Brandt, R.J. Mitte, Bob Odenkirk, Giancarlo Esposito (a terrific actor that I've followed since the lamented quirky TV show \\"Bakersfield P.D.\\") all worthy of Emmy recognition as they dig deeply into their characters to provide us with new shadings with each episode. This could only happen with the terrific writing of creator Vince Gilligan (\\"The X-Files\\") and his team and kudos to the directors and D.P. for bringing a unique look, burned look to the series.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks even better than the HD broadcast of the show which I wasn't sure would be the case; there's richer gritty detail in evidence watching the Blu-ray.<br /><br />The 13 episodes receive a nice selection of special features including commentary tracks on episodes \\"No Mas,\\" \\"Mas,\\" \\"Sunset,\\" \\"One Minute,\\" \\"I See You,\\" \\"Kafkaesque,\\" \\"Fly,\\" \\"Half Measures,\\" and \\"Full Measure.\\"<br /><br />\\"Better Call Saul Commercials and Testimonials\\" allows Bob Odenkirk to riff on his sleazy lawyer on why he should represent YOU. \\"White Heat\\" takes us behind-the-scenes on a dangerous stunt done for the third season.<br /><br />\\"Inside Breaking Bad\\" are the web featurettes.

B004EPYZUI|2.0|I've seen \\"The Crow\\" and \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\" and loved them. I also saw this MTV video of a movie do its best to emulate, pay homage and one up those movies. Sorry, but it falls short on every level but the most superficial. Its a visual powerhouse, but that can only keep people who said things like this about it enthralled : \\"This is an excellent movie, very original and imaginative.\\" - No,its not. \\"Black Swan\\" was original and imaginative, sexier too. Oversaturation is like eating ice cream all day, it loses its appeal after a while. Here's another gem from a fan of this movie : \\"The action and special effects are off the hook it all looks and sounds amazing. This movie is kind of like a comic book and video game mashed together.\\"  I concur the visuals are exceptional, but that is where the budget for the writing went too. Special effects does not a movie make. The characters and dialogue are banal, albeit visually captivating, its not enough to give them substance. Finally : \\"Some say it was a waste of film but I feel they just expect too much now a-days.\\"  I don't think its a total waste, but it certainly could have polished some of that visual power into the characters and script. I don't expect anything from hollywood anymore but shallow sex driven, effects abounding, explosion laden forgettable turds, i.e. sucker punch. Occasionally I'm surprised and a great film comes along once in while. I'm still waiting...
B003UESJ9M|4.0|-------------------------------------  \\"Country Strong\\"  (Sony Pictures, 2011)  -------------------------------------  Though generally compelling, this movie is dramatically split between its strengths and its flaws.  It's a meditation on fame -- the intense, instantaneous, under-the-magnifying-glass, hothouse fame of the modern era -- set against the backdrop of the contemporary Nashville country music scene. Its strengths are in its presentation of how that fame feels to the performers under the spotlight - the overwhelming rush of applause, the blinding lights, the prying reporters, and how those intense emotions can both seduce and terrify those with talent.      Gwyneth Paltrow plays a Martina McBride/Sara Evans-level country superstar wrestling with alcoholism and self-doubt; Leighton Meester is an up-and-coming, radio-ready pretty girl who is her rival in more ways than one.  Meanwhile, Garrett Hedlund plays Paltrow's rough-hewn, Waylon-esque protegee, a simple country guy who lives for the music, man, and not the fame. This is where the film falters: although the characters have unexpected ambiguities and flaws and the script takes some interesting turns, the dialogue is just terrible, full of leaden, naked exposition, where the plot is constantly explained to us in the most over-obvious terms: \\"Honey, you can't make that bad decision because then you will lose your dream and everything you ever worked for.\\"  That kind of thing.  Hedlund's character is the weakest link in the film - he's pure and uncompromised, a talented musician poised on the brink of fame, but with clear enough vision to see how celebrity and show biz politics chews people up and spits them out; he'd rather keep singing in bars rather than go for the brass ring, even when fame is given to him on a silver plate.  It might look good on paper, but rings a bit false when seen on screen.      Nonetheless, this movie is better than many other entries in the somewhat-thin genre of country musicdramas -- not as gritty as \\"Crazy Heart\\" or \\"Coal Miner's Daughter,\\" but better produced than, say, \\"Songwriter\\" or \\"Honeysuckle Rose.\\" Overall, I'd guess that this is a fairly accurate portrayal of what it's like behind-the-scenes on a modern country tour, with a few extra layers of melodrama on top.  Throughout, the made-for-the-movie music is top-notch, a completely convincing mix of revamped outlaw/honkytonk music and bombastic, hi-tech Nashville pop: any song in this film could easily be a radio hit. It's an okay movie, with some forced dialog and schmaltzy, on-the-nose plot points, but still with real country soul.  Worth checking out... I'd give it a 3.5 if I could. (Axton)
0553382179|5.0|I have purchased MANY self help organizing books in the past, but this is by far THE BEST BOOK! IF YOU BUY ONLY ONE BOOK PURCHASE THIS ONE!! What makes this book so differant is the author lays out VERY managable step by step things you can put into practice in your life (not to mention she is very funny), I can tell she's been there. I feel as if she is right with me almost taking my hand (and although she can't do it for me) guiding me the whole way.

0385528752|5.0|I've been studying the roles of the conscious and subconscious minds for some time, and Chip and Dan Heath use the best analogy I've heard to date.  Our subconscious is an elephant, and our conscious mind is the rider of the elephant.  The rider can control the elephant to a certain extent, but it's exhausting, and can't be done forever.  So motivating the elephant (as well as directing the rider and clearing the path) is critical.<br /><br />I've applied what I learned in this book to my business, as well as my personal life.  It's really shed a lot of light on why we do the things we do (or why we fail to do the things we know we should do).  This book is a quick and enjoyable read, and you'll find yourself referring back to it over and over.

B001HN694K|3.0|I used to be a huge Tim Burton fan, but like many directors and writers he lost his edge somewhere along the way. In the late 80s and early 90s he was responsible for some of the most creative, visually stunning and most interesting films I had ever seen; now he is often at the helm of some of the most boring.  Tim Burton has oftentimes had success creating bleak and somewhat depressing tales for children that also appeal to adults and he usually drags Johnn Depp (and in recent years Helena Bonham Carter) along for the ride, so it was really no surprise when I found out he was doing Alice and that it would star who it did, but based on other recent collaborations between the three of them I remained skeptical of what the end result would be.  Here is my main thing: When CGI is done properly it is a thing of wonder and when it is done poorly it can ruin an otherwise acceptable film. The CG in this movie is overwhelming and more-often-than-not, overwhelmingly bad. I am a little confused by why they didn't just make this an animated film, because they chose to animate just about everything. Even things there was no reason to CG! Like the knight's horse. There is no reason on Earth why they couldn't stick a man on a real horse for a few galloping and rearing scenes. Instead they chose to stick him on a horribly unrealistic looking CG horse whose leg movements do not even attempt to mimic those of a natural horse. Same with the bloodhound. and the CGI work on Helena Bonham Carter's character is so poor I'm not even going to get into it in detail in this review.  However, I can't complain about all the CGI. The backgrounds and landscape of Wonderland are, for the most part, beautifully done and embodies the artistry and imagination that made Tim Burton so exciting in the first place. The scenery made me want to explore Wonderland.  Another thing I didn't like was the over-the-top changes in the basic structure of the story of Alice in Wonderland. I think that the originalstory was interesting enough and, in my opinion, a lot of the \\"depth\\" he tried to bring into it ended up detracting instead. But I know most others disagree with me there.  That said I really loved the tea party scene. Even though it was a much darker take on the original, it filled me with nostalgia because the tea party has always, to me, been the creepiest and most unnerving part of the book and I think Tim Burton perfectly recreated the way I always sort of envisioned it as a child.  Depp, of course, saves this movie. While I don't like some aspects of his costume (make-up, etc.) his performance is the strongest of everyone. He really throws himself into every role he does and while I might not like every film he's in, no matter what role he's in he always manages to truly become that character. He always looks like he's genuinely having fun and The Mad Hatter is no different. It's nearly impossible to avoid getting sucked in by his enthusiasm for being the Mad Hatter and I enjoyed that quite a bit.  That said, I do find his accent(s) to be somewhat confusing. He seems to randomly slip in and out of a Scottish accent and I can't tell if that's purposeful for some reason or an accident. But that's a minor point.  Bottom line: Like much of Burton's recent work this movie is interesting to watch and it has a lot of imagination, but poorly executed CGI makes it feel cheap and shoddy. In some places I feel like he tried to be weird just because he is Tim Burton and he knows people expect it, so at times the movie felt forced and tired. Danny Elfman's soundtrack compliments the film and is beautiful, as always, but is also pretty typical of the work he usually does for Burton and in that respect can be a little stale at times.  Is this a bad movie? No. Would I watch it again? Probably not for a very, very long time.
B003Y5H51K|1.0|Rent this - do not buy this.  This is one of the worst acting jobs of all time.

B004SGWYVA|5.0|I am a huge fan of George A. Romero style zombie action. This show takes that style and makes it it's own. There is plenty of eye candy in the form of guns, blood, and lots of T&A. The story is not overly complex. A group of high school students are looking for their families in the middle of a zombie (and eventually nuclear) apocalypse. The team consists of the protagonist, his love interest, the gun otaku, the very tsundere class rep, the sexy kendo girl, the ditzy school nurse, a little girl they rescue, and the dog mascot named Zero. Most of the time it is a fast paced zombie murder extravaganza. When the action slows down it becomes a blood rushing t&a grope fest. That is not saying there is no real story or character development, it is just very shallow compared to a lot of anime I usually enjoy. That is not a complaint mind you. It would have been nice to have the ova on the blu ray, but again I am not complaining as I did not enjoy the ova near as much as the rest of the series. There are no extras whatsoever, but the blu ray is nice. It is crisp and clean. The English dub is not too bad as far as dubs go. I prefer watching it in Japanese with English subs, but that is just a personal preference. People who prefer dubs will not be disappointed. I love this series and recommend it to everyone. Even if you don't watch anime, you should check this out it may surprise you.
B0041KKYGU|1.0|Goes to show no matter how bad a movie is, there's still some senseless people that think it's good or were high on multiple meds. This movie was horrible (similar thoughts about Green Lantern). It was not funny, it was not witty or clever, and no way was it worth the ever rising theater price.     Everything was just plain boring and mind numbing-ly plain. Cameron Diaz isn't laugh-out-loud funny and making her the main character only made that fact clearer than ever. Justin Timberlake also stars in the movie, but the attempts to make the things he do or say funny failed. Only die-hard fans that would jump off a bridge if these two asked would root them on. Snooze-fest alert. Making Cameron Diaz the main star in a comedy type movie is almost as bad as when they put Gerald Butler in a past comedy movie with Jennifer Aniston as a couple, Bounty Hunter, which was a major fail. Gerald Butler in a comedy? Jokes aside please.     Now for possible movie spoilers to back up some of the stuff that I'm saying.     SPOILER ALERT!    1. Timberlake is a nice, fun guy. This movie, in my opinion, made him look bad. Not a funny kind of bad, but that of an insulting nature to the point where it was starting to disgust and annoy me. Maybe even to the point where one would ask themself \\"maybe this is how he is in real life off camera?\\" He received corny, stale dialogues and actions throughout the movie. Example would be at the bar where he sung that stupid rhyming song. I know it was meant to be funny and to poke fun because we all know he's a great singer, but I could only manage a mild awkward smirk. It just wasn't laughing material, it was sad really. Another mention goes out for the scene with them at the attempt of making love with clothes on, funny, but mostly awkward of the lowly nature. Trying a bit hard to get the laughs in are we?    2. You sort of get the feeling that the movie was steering Diaz away from Timberlake and more towards the gym teacher (whatever his name mightbe). However, there were no real strong scenes to show that. Her interest slowly switches but there were no strong scenes to give reason to that change. Sure they ended up talking to each other more, but that's pretty much it, small chit chats here and there.    3. The conflict between the main character and her rival is rather boring because if you think about it, they're both bad teachers who seem to pay more attention in getting at each other than their student. One's a plain out bad teacher and the other one is a closet psychopathic B. Now who do we REALLY root for? Of course Diaz since we know her better. It's more like \\"which teacher do we hate more?\\"     The movie is not only NOT funny, but there's nothing to get out of it either. No morals, no real objective, nothing. It's movies like this that give further reason why people are pirating and downloading illegal movies more and more everyday rather than pay money to watch it. People are afraid to spend REAL money to watch a FAKE movie. It's more of a gamble nowadays to find a good movie in the theater and I might even add a bad gamble. I wouldn't even watch this movie with my enemy so why would I even consider bringing a friend? If a friend made me pay to watch this with them, I would have hated them almost as much as my empty wallet would if it could speak. Only I alone should suffer, I'm the guinea pig of movie watching.     Movie industry against pirating and illegal downloads? Solution? Make better movies and lower theater/dvd/bluray prices. Sounds simple but obviously very difficult or probably impossible. Making us pay top dollars for a crappy product...I'm pretty sure they're thankful to all those people out there that can't tell the difference between something of acceptable quality and total and utter crap.    I can be for certain when I say there's probably countries that are using movies like this as torturing methods.    SUM IT UP!    Movie failed cause of two main factors:  1. Boring plot littered with tons of worthless scenes that add little to nothing to the general storyline.  2. Actors that were NOT suited for the movie and therefore did not feel natural. Diaz as the main character to a comedy? NO. I love her and Justin, but they were not meant for this movie.
B004G600A4|5.0|Ok - I'm a 43 year old, married female with no kids. My mother used to use me as an excuse to get HER into see animated films at the theatre, so you see the family heritage here. I have no kids to drag along, so I drag my husband instead. Felt that background was important to note.    I was moderately interested in Tangled, and we ended up renting it on DVD. I thought for sure this would be a movie he wasn't particularly interested in, but he decided to give it a go with me. We both laughed until we cried. The next day I ordered my copy on Amazon. What a delightful, humorous twist on this classic story.  If Emmys could go to animated characters (who are also non-human), the horse gets my vote. Yes, he acts more like a dog than a horse - just don't over-analyze and enjoy it! Great music, great villain in the \\"mother\\", and highly recommended as a great choice for family movie night.
B004EPYZPI|4.0|Judge David Johnson, DVD Verdict -- \\"You know what The Lincoln Lawyer feels like? Old school. I have a difficult time putting my finger on why I feel that way, but it just seems we don't get a lot of movies like these out of the studios these days. There are no visual effects, no bombast, no 3D gimmicks. It's just an actor and a story cleverly told. Credit to McConaughey for bringing this guy to life. He really is electric here, further bolstering his impressive portfolio of attorney roles; he's got that way of being slick and in command and approachable without coming across as a douchebag--vital ingredients to pulling the Haller character off. And though we may be deprived of a neck-twisting Primal Fear-like twist, the thrills are still potent and the payoff is rewarding. Extras are headlined by three HD featurettes: an overall making-of documentary, a tour of LA with Michael Connelly, an interview with McConaughey conducted by Connelly, and a handful of deleted scenes. The 2.35:1, 1080p transfer is a great piece of visual fidelity, and we get a 7.1 DTS-HD audio mix! I thought those were extinct.\\"

0375413405|5.0|After watching the movie \\"Julie and Julia\\", I decided to launch my own mini-project this summer of cooking a wide selection of recipes from this classic.  My family has been thrilled, needless to say!  Every few days, I try something new and it does not disappoint.  The recipes are extremely well written and if you read over them in advance and follow the directions, you simply cannot go wrong.    I considered myself a halfway decent cook before experimenting with these recipes.  Now, I am gaining confidence and doing things in the kitchen I never imagined--- I can now clarify butter, truss a chicken and make a killer hollandaise sauce.    I love the fact that not only do you get the recipe to help you in the moment, but you get thorough explanations as to different cuts of meat (and their names in English), as well as wine and side dish suggestions that are truly spot on. Julia and Simca are experts in the techniques you need to know to make a wonderfully authentic French meal for your family and friends. As Simca would say, \\"elegante Parisienne\\" all the way--in other words, the recipes here are about elegance and incredible flavor.    Some of my family's favorites include the incredibly fluffy Quiche Lorraine, the veggie-filled Soupe au Pistou and of course, Coq au Vin.     Get this book--you will not be sorry.

I received this movie well packaged to prevent damage and I received it very quickly after it was converted because for many of the movies I want I have ordered and been placed on a waiting list.

He is carried by the fantastic acting of Paul Giamatti, as the inspector and by a very strong script. Norton's clever dialouge also helps make the movie, as his words to the inspector have alternate or hidden meanings. Norton attempts to win his childhood sweetheart from the prince as she was torn away from him in his youth due to their class differences. This is a movie you must pay attention to and watch closely in order to get the full effect. No fast forwarding allowed. It was currently in the Wal-Mart $5.00 bin and used ones are even cheaper on Amazon. This one is a keeper.

159514188X|5.0|My husband gave me this book as a gift. When I saw the cover I was immediately pulled in, then I flipped it over and read:    You can't st'p the future.  You can't rew«nd the past.  The only way to learn the secret  . . . is to press pl>y.    Now, not only did I want to read it, but I needed to start reading it right then.     Jay Asher's debut Novel, Thirteen Reasons Why, was simply brilliant. It provides you with the thoughts of not only the person who committed suicide, but also one of the people affected by their decision. Asher shows how your actions can affect others in unexpected and sometimes deadly ways. I loved the use of audiotapes. It was such an irreplaceable part of the book because when I was reading it I felt as if I could not stop reading for the same reason Clay could not stop listening - he needed to know why Hannah committed suicide and how he may have led her to that decision. I also loved the way he ended the book, which I will just say was wonderfully inspiring so as not to give the ending away.     While I understand that the topic of suicide is hard for many people to stomach it also is a very real issue that lots of people know little to nothing about, especially teens. I believe that this will be a great book for generations to come because it opens the door to conversations about the hard truth that some people do consider and even commit suicide. Thirteen Reasons Why was an eye opening look at how we impact others and some of the signs of a person crying out for help. I would definitely recommend this book to others!

B004VUP8WK|1.0|Morbid Angel is THE band that got me into extreme music oh so many years ago with their underrated, \\"Blessed Are the Sick\\".  For them to come out with this album after so many years on hiatus, is more than a travesty; It is more like a mockery of themselves and all of death metal.  My title for this review says it all.  David Vincent has spent way too many years involved in his wife's idiotic band (yes, IDIOTIC) and it clearly shows with this release.  Somehow, he managed to convince the rest of Morbid Angel that this was the direction they were supposed to take.  It just makes no sense to me.  If they were this money-hungry, could they have just not taken the hiatus?<br /><br />Now for my review of the CD.  First of all, this is not modern death metal.  This is lighter than pretty much all death metal released over 10 years ago.  David Vincent was never known for his deep growls and this CD shows him continuing this trend and getting even weaker on his growling ability.  His growls are more like a mid-range rasp.  Lamb of God has heavier growls and heavier music than this, and they aren't even death metal!  The next problem with this CD is the music itself, which has been dumbed down to a point of boredom.  The music is very simplistic, repetitive, and old-feeling.  I mean, why does \\"Too Extreme!\\" have to be over 6 minutes?!  The song is bad enough as a 1 or 2 minute song, but 6 minutes of it just makes the listening Morbid Angel fan want to throw the CD out the window!  Anyway, the riffs are very groove oriented but not in a compelling sort of way.  Some of these riffs, I have DEFINITELY heard before.  The song structure is so simplistic, I still can't believe this is Morbid Angel I am hearing?!  The addition of techno elements to the music (clearly ripped off from David Vincent's experience with the Genitorturers) shows just how far Morbid Angel have strayed.  The techno does fit the music, but that is because the music is not death metal and sucks badly!...  Come on, if your girlfriend listens to this CD playing and breaks out in a club dance, you'll understand exactly what type of CD this is (yes, my woman broke out in a dance to \\"Destructos VS the Earth\\"! :-(  ).<br /><br />Now for my least favorite part of the CD, which is the lyrics and song titles: HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE!  David Vincent was never a poet, but I never thought him a retard either.  That is, until now.  I can't even decide what lyrics I hate the least, because they are all that bad.  There is nothing deep, dark, or thought-provoking on here.  It is all bad and retarded; it is worse than the mall-core crap I hear blaring at Hot Topic.  FAR WORSE!  David Vincent should not be writing lyrics.  I have no idea why Trey would allow him to contribute lyrically to this?!<br /><br />Well, there are two decent songs on this album and they are \\"Blades For Baal\\" and \\"Nevermore\\", which most people already know by now.  Both still don't blow me away.  Almost everything else on this CD is really, really, REALLY bad.  This CD will not enter my car CD player, nor will I give this CD any more repeated listens after I finish typing this review.  The only other redeeming quality I can think of for this CD is that the few guitar solos that are on this CD are good solos.<br /><br />So, if you are a retarded mall-core moron, buy this CD and claim how heavy and cool you are.  Otherwise, consider this the \\"St. Anger\\" of death metal and hope/pray for a redeeming CD in the future.  I really wasted my money on this.  Honestly, this is probably one of my most disappointing CD's in all of metal!  Perhaps, Metallica's \\"St. Anger\\" is actually heavier and more compelling than this?  I think I'll go back and give it a chance.  It can't be as bad as this garbage...if your girlfriend listens to this CD playing and breaks out in a club dance, you'll understand exactly what type of CD this is (yes, my woman broke out in a dance to \\"Destructos VS the Earth\\"! :-(  ).

0393324818|4.0|An engaging read. Picked it up at the library as I hear it will be a movie starring Missouri Guy Brad Pitt. Had heard it was about numbers, like it was a stat sheet so I wondered how it could be a movie. It is well written, engaging as the author is embeded in the Oakland Athletics baseball club for a year. Tells the story of Billy Bean. Suprised to read the scouts look at ballplayers and decide if they can play based on what they call a 'good face'. Pathetic. See how many #1 draft picks don't make it, it's a big number.        Billy and his crew THINK they have a magic formula to acquire ballplayers.  Their team wins regular season games but Billy admits,\\"My (stuff) doesn't work in the post season.  Hmmm.        I became a believer in his idea about walks, they do matter, saw Jon Rausch go CRAZY when an umpire would not call a strike.  Listen to a game, on 3 ball two strike counts the hitters usually hit into an out. Homeruns are ralley enders, umnless they are back to back.       They were also against stolen bases, felt they were ONLY sucessful 70% of the time. Hmmm, which created outs, which are the enemy, which is true.  Stressed the importance of having just 27 outs, so they are important. Heard an announcer talking about how important the final 6 out were. They all are important. Saw one day in the paper where of all the games played on one day, only one team did not win that had the most walks. Interesting. The next day it was about 50/50.       Billy throws a phone, Billy swears, ye ha. Unfortunately, many of their players did not pan out. It is a tuff game, that is why they get PAID when they are good.

B004RLPWXS|5.0|I LOVE THIS ALBUM FROM START TO FINISH! IT'S SO HOT WITH THE COOL BEATS, MELODIES, & LYRICS. SIMON LEBON STILL HAS A GREAT BEAUTIFUL VOICE, NICK STILL HOT ON THE SYNTHESIZER / KEYBOARDS & JOHN WITH THE COOL BASS RIFFS. AMAZING, COOL, FUN, PHENOMENAL ALBUM. I LOVE DURAN DURAN'S MUSIC FROM THE 80'S TO NOW, THAT I JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT. DESPITE THE FACT I DIDN'T GROW UP IN THE 80'S BECAUSE I WAS JUST BORN AT THE MID-PEAK OF THEIR CAREER (1985) I'M GLAD TO BE A NEW YOUNG FAN OF THEIR MUSIC, IT'S SO COOL THAT I LOVE LISTENING TO IT ALL THE TIME.<br /><br />MY FAVORITE SONGS ARE: GIRL PANIC!, OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES, MEDITERRANEAN, TOO BAD YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL, RUNAWAY RUNAWAY, ALL YOU NEED IS NOW, BEING FOLLOWED, LEAVE A LIGHT ON, & BLAME THE MACHINES. REALLY THE WHOLE ALBUM ROCKS ANYWAY! SINCE I AGREE WITH MOST FANS ON HERE, THAT THERE ISN'T A WEAK SONG ON THE ALBUM. THIS IS EVEN MORE OF A STRONGER COMBAT ALBUM MORE THAN THE RED CARPET MASSACRE. WHICH WAS OK, BUT NOT AS HOT AS THIS ALBUM. THE ASTRONAUT ALBUM WAS COOL WITH SOME GOOD SONGS, BUT NOT AS STRONG AS THIS ALBUM, BECAUSE IT DIDN'T CAPTURE THEIR UNIQUE NEW WAVE SOUND ALL THE WAY, LIKE THE ALL YOU NEED IS NOW ALBUM. I LOVE ANYTHING THEY MAKE ANYWAY. DURAN DURAN ROCKS!! I LOVE NICK RHODES THE BEST IN THE GROUP, BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH HE DOESN'T SING BUT HE SINGS THROUGH HIS PLAYING ON THE SYMPATHIZER / KEYBOARDS WHICH HE MAKES AN INCREDIBLE AWESOME SOUND WITH. THAT'S WHY I LOVE NICK RHODES FOR THAT REASON BECAUSE HE'S SO TALENTED FOR IT. SINCE IT REALLY SHOWS ON THIS ALBUM, JUST LIKE IT ALWAYS HAS FOR MANY YEARS NOW SINCE THE BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER. ALL OF THE MEMBERS ARE AMAZING MUSICIANS. I LOVE DURAN DURAN!!!
0756405890|4.0|This high fantasy novel breaks high fantasy tropes/cliches while still remaining high fantasy.  It succeeded, but the first hundred pages are rough and amateur.  Once I hit page 170 though, I finished the book in one day; it became engrossing, quality work.    Still what makes the initial impression?  Rothfuss starts the story well, and up to about chapter four it's good, but then he starts using the 'nested story' technique.  I hate nested stories because as soon as I achieve immersion in one story, I want to keep reading that story, not start a separate story from scratch.  (If I wanted to read another different book, I would, no... I'm reading your book, not your encyclopedia of mythology.) Rothfuss did an excellent job tying half of his nested stories together, but I still had that annoyed 'What does scene X have to do with story A?' vibe three times.  I skipped a chapter about \\"the Chronicler\\", because when your new perspective character is a job title, he isn't interesting or dimensional.  A section 10 pages long about his world's creation myth (Demon Dark Ecc-somthing falls from heaven) that had nothing to do with the characters, made me put the book down.  Three days later I tried again, and soon I skipped a similar creation myth about the Chandrain.      Twenty pages later, I had to go back and re-read the Chandrain myth, because it was story-relevant.  This made me think 'maybe Rothfuss does know where the story is going and only appears disjointed'.  Rescued the novel.  The first creation myth though, put me out of the story, and should have been cut.  Additionally the introduction of the Chronicler with the highwaymen should have been cut or rewritten with more characterization.    Anyway, after finishing the book, it is an excellent start for a high fantasy franchise.  The magic and characterization is top-notch.  But it's a first novel, and I've seen dozens of first novels implode on book two because the author spent years polishing book one and doesn't have the skill to make book two shine in the publisher's time frame.  \\"The Name of the Wind\\" gave me a bumpy-first-novel-start into a meticulously drawn masterpiece, but I then read an author interview where Rothfuss says \\"Assuming I had any sort of plan at the beginning is a big mistake. I just started writing. I didn't have a plan. I didn't know what I was doing.\\"  Yeah, it's extremely obvious.    I'm not ready to love \\"The Name of the Wind\\" until Rothfuss can deliver a sequel that isn't a meandering mess.  (Keep in mind I haven't read *anything* about book two yet.)  Excellent start, but I can't recommend the series based on introductory volume one barely scratching the surface of Kvothe's legend.  I hope book two is more like \\"The Two Towers\\" and less like Wheel of Time -- Book 8.
B0053F042G|3.0|This movie is above-average compared to a standard action/bomb movie.  I'd recommend this to you if you were kind of bored, looking for a fun movie.  As a bonus, there are a few moments that cause you to think and reflect on your own life.  I wouldn't say it's groundbreakingly good or anything (I don't see why RottenTomatoes gave it 91% fresh, this is more like a 60% fresh movie to me), but it did keep me entertained for the full duration.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|Paid money for this app since the free one on the google market didn't work.  This app doesn't work either... what's up with that?  How are going to charge money for an app that doesn't run?  EPIC FAIL!
B0029QRA1U|4.0|First off, I haven't used the USB conversion yet so this will be based on just the table performance as far as playing records.  I was rather impressed for $60.00-ish (amazon needs to explain why prices rise and drop constantly). I'm sure there are better tables, but this is the best for the price. The hook up is simple and easy, and operation is fairly simple (just need to know how all the parts work).  Although I do recommend that buyers should upgrade to a diamond tip needle rather than the sapphire tip this one comes equip with.  I think a previous comment actually points this out (replacements are like $20.00).  I've had this player skip on a few occasions, but that because some of my records are EXTREMELY dirty, so I suggest either buying some cleaner, or washing them by hand and wiping them down with a lint-free clothe to make sure the grooves are extremely clean.  This player does not hook up to a phono input.  The guide really should explain that before they go blow out their receiver.  Otherwise, decent buy as far as playing records. I really would like to see how this performs as a converter.
0307279189|3.0|The book as a whole makes an interesting point. We do better without all that highly cushioned footwear. In short, we only need our heels for standing. As a man with chronic foot pain I am trying out his propsition; I am sick and tired of orthotics. Now you know the point of the book. McDougall tends to romaticize his characters too much, but there are a few interesting characters in the book that make it a good read, but as a story it is just couldn't get absorbed in it.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I Thought the movie was very entertaining.  It was great to see Cher back on the big screen.  Her solo of \\"You Haven't Seen The Last Of Me\\" was one of the movies highlights.  Christina sounded great as usual and the dance numbers were fantastic.  Enjoy this movie for what it is, Escapism at it's finest!
B003KGBISY|5.0|I never thought you could make a b&w movie look so good but they have done it one of the greatest movies ever made  even better yay
B0000A5A0T|5.0|I'm no expert on jazz by any means, so I am not qualified to evaluate the \\"greatness\\" of this album or anything like that. All I can say is: I like the music. It is interesting from start to finish, with inventive solos, good tunes, and all the musicians seem to be working together well.<br /><br />So you don't need to be a jazz insider to like this. Of course they probably appreciate it more, but for the rest of us, it's just good music.
B004SBQAN8|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and thought that Alex (the Star) did a fantastic acting job.  The pace of the film is exciting and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  For a Sci-Fi film, it is a terrific one and I would recommend it to anyone who loves good sci-fi.
B004VQRCF0|4.0|this is a great show for ANY yes fan. unfortunately it's only in DVD format. that's not why the four stars though. that's because it is only a partial show. they AT LEAST left ut Jon's solo (soon) and Lift Me Up. i have this show on CD format and it was a three disk CD job. still...great show
0307719774|5.0|I love to buy journals but often have trouble writing in them after just a few initial entries.  It could be that life gets too busy or that there seems to be nothing in particular to write about that I will want to remember later.  This journal has solved my writer's block by providing questions at the top of each page.<br /><br />Pros<br />- Each page is dated with the month and day (January 1)<br />- There are five spaces below for the year \\"20__\\" so that you can start on the correct date you get the book.  You do not have to wait until January to start your journal, but you can, if that's what you would like<br />- There are four lines to write your answer so you will have to be concise<br /><br />Cons<br />- the binding is tight and the pages are rather small so you have to hold the book open to write in it (so it does not lay flat on it's own)<br />- there is gold foil which lines the outsides of the pages.  It looks fantastic now, but I don't know how much it will hold up over the next 5 years<br />- the cover feels a little more like cardboard so the photo is a little misleading, but it is hardcover and sturdy<br /><br />Something I wish I knew when I purchased it were the types of questions it would ask, so below are a sampling of the types of questions in the book.  Some are more exciting and some are more boring but at least this gives you an idea.<br /><br />Sample Questions:<br />What is your mission? (January 1)<br />Did you kiss someone today? (February 14)<br />Did you sleep alone last night? (March 3)<br />Who are you fooling? (April 1)<br />If you could travel anywhere tomorrow, where would you go? (May 25)<br />What makes a good friend? (June 9)<br />_______ is funny. (July 4)<br />Write down your last sent text message (August 9)<br />What shocking news have you learned recently? (September 22)<br />Halloween plans?  What's your costume (October 31)<br />What was the last risk you took? (November 28)<br />Write down five days that describe today(December 25)<br /><br />I would definitely purchase this as a gift for a friend or anyone who loves to write.  I think when the journal is complete it will be really interesting to see how much your answers have (or haven't) changed over five years.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book's been getting a lot of buzz....and believe me, there is a reason for this.  Beautiful Disaster is an unbelievable read.<br /><br />Although some categorize this one as a young adult read....please don't let that deter you.  This book reads like an adult contemporary romance.  The characters are in their first year of college and this book will definitely  bring you back to those days!<br /><br />Some people say that this book is a character study for a co-dependent, obsessive, dangerous relationship.  Although I can understand this thought process, in my fantasy world, this one pushed all my right buttons!<br /><br />Travis is an underground \\"fight club\\" champion.  Men fear him and women want him.  He is covered in tattoos and has a very untouchable demeanor.  Abby, our heroine, comes onto the scene and is unimpressed by Travis.  Instead of throwing herself at him as most all women do, she remains aloof and hard to get.  Travis is attracted to this immediately and begins to woo her into a friendship.<br /><br />I loved the fact that this relationship develops.  Travis is accustomed to one night stands in which he doesn't care, never calls, and barely remembers.  Abby (nicknamed \\"Pigeon\\" by Travis) breaks all his rules by becoming someone that he respects and cares for before their relationship turns sexual.<br /><br />What really sets this book apart, and what the buzz is all about, is Travis's obsession with Abby.  She becomes his entire world, his conscience, his guide, his EVERYTHING.  The intensity with which Travis loves Abby is downright uncomfortable at times.  In real life, if I knew someone was in a relationship like Abby and Travis, I would be calling for an intervention.  However, there is safety in fiction, and I loved every moment of his obsession.<br /><br />I have not been able to move past this book.  It's been difficult to match it, and to be honest, I've stopped trying.  There is only one Beautiful Disaster and only  one Travis Maddox.<br /><br />Read this book!
B000OVLBHG|5.0|I had to laugh at the review mentioning Caspar Van Diem's acting ability - there is one brilliant scene to illustrate this, when he is heading down (WARNING: MANY PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD!!!) 'washout lane' only to see everyone else running towards a giant screen - see how he runs, blow wave staying firmly in place. This is one guy I will take a punt wasn't picked for his convincing jogging abilities. A part in Swan lake, perhaps, but not as a kick-ass grunt fighting bugs. The little lady in KICK ASS had tons more pizzazz and KICK, to illustrate my point.    Having got that off my chest, this is one brilliant, brilliant film which takes a pot shot at everything - militarism, brainless conformity, a pro-gun culture, wading into the unknown then getting slaughtered and wondering why, military planners' stupidity and callousness (treating enlisted soldiers little better than pawns, or bugs); the horror of atomic weaponry, the vapidity and shallowness as to what true beauty is all about, I could go on and on.    Those viewing this as just a rip-snortingly great sci-fi jaunt with extraordinary special effects are absolutely correct but have entirely, entirely missed the subtleties and the main point of the Director. I imagine Vorhoeven (pardon me if I misspelled the surname) laughing even harder when told audiences took the whole thing literally. It is one of the most devastating critiques of militaristic societies I can think of - that he managed to get it made and released all over the world is testament to his brilliance and perhaps the superficiality of censorship and studio priorities and benchmarks.    Sure we've got Denise Richards being draw-droppingly cute and buxom, plus a host of supporting actors ready to drop their togs, but Richards' character turns around and dumps Rico (van Diem) to 'go career'. That sends Rico careering into a spiral of anger and despair yet at the same time transforms him into the leader he immortalized being the character played by MichaelIronside, who comes up with the immortal line 'whatsa matta, do ya wanna live forever?!'.    I get the sense this review is meandering all over the place, but the central point is that this is a highly intelligent and devastating critique of, yes, the human race, and how brutal are our impulses which are in direct inverse proportion to our understanding of the world around us, in my humble opinion.    But there is much to enjoy just from the extraordinary production standards and the simply wonderful special effects - the scene where the troops land at a deserted outpost, only to find the troops guarding it have been massacred, coming across a coward of a general who has lost his mind and took refuge and was found cowering inside a cabinet before being discovered, with the contempt obvious from the infantry witnessing the sorry spectacle - then only to be confronted by a massive bug attack that fills the valley before them - that really is as good as it gets in my book - capturing both the stupidity, meaninglessness of war but at the same time the incredible bravery and resilience of those sent to do the bloody work.    I had reservations when I was walking in to see this in the cinema when it was first released, feeling a little silly, and I am happy to admit partly what drew me in was the review I watched of rather comely young lasses jumping around in rather tight-fitting spacewear. But the film blew me away. 'Would you like to know more'?    A last comment - don't be too hard on Caspar Van Diem - his character Johnny Rico - whose name says it all - is none too smart, and comes within a whisker of being sent home in disgrace, but van Diem is smart enough to play the role to perfection. Granted, I can't get over the blow-dried hair running sequence but he keeps his helmet on mercifully for much of the rest of the picture, but his story is about giving it a go, making mistakes, not giving up, and making something of one's life. He pulls it off rather nicely, as allthe high school friends drift apart, coming even to despise one another to an extent based on their choices - each starts to grow up a bit.    But a BIG warning - I realise teens these days think they have seen it all, but here the violence is graphic and hard to watch, including decapitations, brains being sucked out, arms being torched, bodies being hurled into space, commanders being cut in two by sliding doors, many scenes of dismemberment by those nasty bugs that have pincers the size of caterpillar machinery, and what I would classify as a borderline torture scene when Richards is pinned through the shoulder by a bug in a cave. But, of course, this is Hollywood, so five seconds later she is incongruously bouncing along chatting to her buddies....    In that respect, I'd recommend parents watching this film with their young charges - there are many comments made about any wealthy society and the choices people make, ethical dilemmas and all the rest - that are worth considering so the impressionable ones amongst us do not walk away interpreting this masterpiece as just the superficial 'bug hunt' some celebrate it for being. Sure, there is a lot of humour, and black humour, but this film also has a darker message, and quite a controversial one, espoused by a Dutch-born auteur who is looking on America as an outsider. As an Australian viewer, I found myself thinking about all the messages that can equally be applied to my country, its myths, hubris, military celebrations, thirst for foreign 'adventures' that translate into bloody morasses....I'll leave it at that.    While I'm here, those who can't cope with a reviewer injecting a contemporary take on a film that has perhaps political, cultural and sociological comments included, may I subtly suggest you are deluding yourselves and have swallowed the lie - hook, line and sinker. Film is a cultural document. Whether by omission or inclusion of particular themes and messages, every Director by the very choices they make is making a political statement. To not overtly criticise society but to do so in the construct of an over-the-top teeny-bopper sci-fi extravaganza is a political choice made by the Director. To live in a free society is to be able to discuss and openly debate such themes and issues, rather than be howled down by others who seemingly can't cope with being shifted outside their comfort zone. Here endeth my epistle.     Yet highly original touches, like the massive beetles that send missiles hurtling into space from their rears...reminiscent of the giant hamster in The Nutty Professor (No. 2 I think)...    Yet one thing the Director is not doing is taking the Mickey out of sci-fi as a genre or movies as a format for delivering powerful messages - as Goebbels knew only too well, cinema can master the mind of any viewer, and Vorhoeven (i know I'm not spelling that correctly...) is a master of the craft, here at the top of his game.
0425241505|5.0|For me, a book must hit certain marks to qualify for 5 star status.<br /><br />Here are my criteria:<br />-must be almost impossible to put down<br />-must have characters that I love and enjoy reading about<br />-must have a believable romance<br />-must evoke strong emotions in me<br />-must be re-readable<br />-must be memorable<br /><br />Dragon Bound definitely qualifies as a 5 star read!  I am so excited to have a new paranormal series to get excited about.<br /><br />Being the first book in the series, there is a fair amount of world building going on.  I loved this new world because it incorporates dragons, fae, gryphons, goblins, elves.....ect.  Dragos is the stuff that real heroes are made of.  He is the most powerful of the Wyr, and is feared by everyone.  He is definitely alpha of his clan of warriors, and answers to no one.<br /><br />Pia dares to challenge this warrior from page 1 and never backs down.  I loved her tenacity and her sense of humor.  Dragos is instantly attracted to Pia and it doesn't take him long to claim her as his own.  I loved this.  His attraction, commitment, jealousy, protection, and attention that he lavishes on Pia gave me goose bumps throughout, and I have found myself re-reading many parts of their interactions since finishing this book.<br /><br />There are a tons of really awesome guys in this series...all just waiting for their books.  Tiago is next and then it's Rune.  I for one have already pre-ordered and am eagerly awaiting the release dates.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B001DJLD1M|3.0|The Matrix franchise is, in retrospect, a fascinating exercise in flawed sci-fi film-making.  In 1999, when The Matrix was released, it had the simultaneous advantage and disadvantage of going up against the highly anticipated Star Wars: Episode One.  It had the disadvantage in competing with an established sci-fi franchise, but it also had an advantage in riding the wake of backlash against Star Wars, when Episode 1 turned out to be the worst of all 6 Star Wars movies.  It wasn't long before disgruntled fanboys would turn from Star Wars, and hail the Matrix as the new savior of sci-fi.  It was understandable, having left the theater myself after The Phantom Menace ended, with the distinct thought, \\"what the hell was that?\\"  Yet, in retrospect, the Matrix franchise can't really be viewed as competing with Star Wars, Star Trek, or the yet-to-be released Lord of the Rings Trilogy, despite the pundits' need to set up some sort of \\"creative struggle\\" between the franchises.  Unfortunately, a few of the people involved with the Matrix didn't see it that way, especially visual effects chief John Gaeta, who would take multiple opportunities over the years to comment on The Matrix's supposed superiority to its erstwhile competition.  Without giving too many points away, The Matrix franchise is better compared to more standard action movies, mixed with an anime sensibility, as opposed to franchises that establish distinct and memorable universes.<br /><br />At its best, the Matrix franchise offers stylish action, with a slightly intellectual bent, and scenes such as the Morpheus rescue mission, the Burly Brawl, the freeway chase, the chateau fight, and the final battle between Agent Smith and Neo all illustrate how entertaining the action can be.  At their worst, the films are loaded down with bad acting, poor dialogue, pretentious \\"edgy attitude for its own sake\\", and characters that just aren't that likeable.  It's the last problem that, in my opinion, is the biggest offender.  Star Wars (well, with a few exceptions), Star Trek and Lord of the Rings have all featured protagonists you can feel for, and get behind.  On the other hand, even the original Matrix, which is considered the best and most consistent film of the franchise, loses sight of this important quality by the last third of the movie, when Neo seems to toss aside his humanity, in favor of being an unemotional killing machine.  As the franchise progressed, Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith, the principal bad guy, became more likeable than the erstwhile \\"heroes\\".  Other frustrations include a promising twist at the end of \\"Reloaded\\" never really being followed up on, the obvious cribbing of aesthetics from both the Aliens franchise and the Terminator movies, and moments where the Wachowski Brothers feel the need to club the viewer over the head with exposition (e.g. the captain of one ship feeling the need to reiterate how well Niobe can \\"drive\\" a ship at least twice.....even though we can see for ourselves at that same time).<br /><br />That being said, the sum total of the movie's strong points makes it at least worth buying at this price point.  While this is a rather bare-bones collection in terms of extras, hearing John Gaeta go on about how awesome his work is isn't something I'll really miss.  The \\"true\\" bonus here is the inclusion of the Animatrix, a collection of animated shorts in several different styles that explore various \\"side stories\\" in the world of the Matrix, including the Second Renaissance, a two-part, anime-style exploration of the rise of the machine AI during the height of mankind's decadence.  Overall, it's more consistent than its live-counterparts, if a bit more grim (but this is, after all, a rather bleak franchise in tone).  Like most of WB's other \\"4 Film Favorites\\" movies, this comes on 2 double-sided DVDs, with one movie per side.  For the price, this collection is worth picking up if you aren't a big fan of the Matrix, but find parts of it entertaining nonetheless, or are a complete newcomer; just don't go in expecting anything close to flawless, and you won't be too disappointed.s, or are a complete newcomer; just don't go in expecting anything close to flawless, and you won't be too disappointed.
B0053F042G|1.0|Do yourself a favor and don't watch it. Bad acting, no plot, predictable and just terrible. Whoever wrote the script and directed this movie needs to get fired.
0061537969|5.0|Wow, once started you cannot put it down and if you own a pet, you start looking at your own differently.  I can imagine mine saying, thinking and doing the same things.      You laugh, cry, be stunned in parts.  This book is #1 for all to read.  I wanted to have the dog whisperer talk to my one dog Alex and this fit the bill.  I wish I could have afforded it but I also hope he comes back as a person and comes to me.  He's very welcome to return as all of mine are.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|We all have those books that we read that we can hardly put down, the ones that consume our thoughts when we aren't reading them and stay with us long after we have finished them. The ones that ruin all other books for us because, they will never be as good as the one we just put down. This book? This book was that book for me.<br />I had read other reviews about this book, saw lots of 5 star ratings and thought to myself, \\"oh no, not another one of those books that will never live up to all the hype. Do I even want to read this?\\"<br />I have been so burned by books that people are raving about, the ones that they promise are all that and then some *cough*thegirlwiththedragontattoo*cough*.<br />Thankfully this wasn't one of them. I truly liked this book, heck I LOVE this book. In fact I am having a really hard time keeping myself from not start it all over again I liked it that much. In fact, I know I will re-read this one...soon, very very soon. And the real kicker about this book? I got it for FREE months ago for my Kindle.<br />I love that the characters in this book are so real, someone we would be friends with, someone we would fall for. I love that they have problems we could have and parents and friends that aren't perfect, the fact that they aren't perfect and know it.<br />This truly was a great book and now, now, I have the hard decision of finding the next book to read and hoping, that I can put all my attention into it because this one is still stuck with me.
B004QNN1UI|5.0|I have loved Simply Red for years. This CD is the best one I have heard (my husband and I can listen to there music over and over and never get tired of it). This CD is definately a keeper!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I seriously think I loved every single thing about this book. In fact, I had an extremely hard time putting it down, something about it just captured my attention and demanded to be read. When I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it.<br />In fact I was sad that it ended and wanted to turn around and start reading it all over again, it was that good.<br />This was my first book from the author that I have read but it certainly won't be my last.
B0007P0LO8|4.0|This is one of the better Madam Butterflys' that I own.  I liked the young Domingo's voice and acting capabilities. I have 10 copies of the complete opera and 2 copies of different videos and this ranks right up there with the best. The rest is subject to listener/viewers taste.
0553582038|2.0|I've enjoyed all of the books in the series up to this one.  It was boring and lost my interest.  I didn't even finish reading it.  Hope the next book is better.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|First of all, don't watch this film if you get nightmares.  The head-on collision scene will haunt you.<br /><br />Yes, there is a lot of dialog, and at no point does it sound fake or forced.  I'll take good dialog over acres of broken glass any day.  Kurt Russell in the role of his career, and Zoë Bell is unforgettable.
B004SBX112|2.0|The game is fun and 4 or 5 star worthy, but I am getting video ads after levels. That's pretty ridiculous to pay, but still get ads.
B004HD61KE|2.0|I am a huge Rollins/Sigma fan and I have read all of his books and would still consider Mr. Rollins one of my favorite authors. I now understand why they had to postpone the release of this book for multiple rewrites. With that said don't waste your money on this book. The world is ending and every situation the teams get themselves in hopeless and like 2 against 30 and of course they come out on top every time. He just took it to far on this one and I can only hope that he gets back to the old ways before he finishes the next piece.<br /><br />As for everyone complaining about the price just go buy the Hardback or wait for the Kindle price to drop it will in 60 days or so they always do.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have enjoyed this app since it was the free app of the day over a month ago. It is very addictive and I played it all the time until I beat it.  Those who complain about the storage size should expect that with larger, more advanced games. For those who are mad it is a port - did you want them to remake the entire game just for Android? I am very happy and was glad it worked flawlessly on my DROID X.
0062060554|5.0|I was up all night.  Could not put this great book down until I had finished it.  That is all I can say is WOW!  One of my all time favorites. It is hard to believe that this is the first book this person has written. But it or borrow it.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I first heard this album by borrowing it, and the first two, from a friend. This CD was my favorite of all three. During that time in my life, I was feeling a little down and realized that Linkin Park was very relatable. They sounded even more messed up than I was feeling, and so I didn't feel so bad. The entire album seems to be kind of depressed, as if these people are all at dead ends in their lives in every single possible way and made all of that into songs. I bought this CD because it became such a big part of my life. I listened to it countless times.<br /><br />My least-favorite song is The Little Things Give You Away. It's just too long and drawn-out, and the last two or three minutes all are very similar with a repeating chorus.<br /><br />My favorite song is Leave Out All the Rest. I felt like it was a message to me from a kid that I had known before moving away. I would have to say this is what the band's sound in Minutes to Midnight is like.<br /><br />It's a great album, and the most successful one for Linkin Park. This is how they became mainstream, and why they became the second best new rock band of the 2000s (the decade), after Coldplay.
B004LWZW2E|5.0|At last a horror movie that's actually scary and creepy. I loved this movie its brilliantly directed and suburbly acted. It's been a long while since a horror movie actually made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up! Don't miss it
B0036EH3UC|5.0|Not much more to say than has been said in previous reviews--this package has all the episodes plus Razor and The Plan. BIG FYI: Razor has its own case, but The Plan is not marked on any case. It is hidden in the case for Season 4.0 disc 4.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|Heard an interview on Public Radio and was impressed. I had forgotten that Natalie Merchant sang with the 10,000 Maniacs. Purchased the double CD package and have been playing it every day. Even read and played some of the pieces to 3 of my young grandchildren. My wife also loves this. Anyone who loves poetry should buy this. Anyone who loves music should buy this. Anyone who loves children should buy this for themselves and then read other similar pieces to their children. Did I say my wife loved this - we don't always agree on music but we do on this. Marvelous is too mild a word. Even the darkerside of some of these pieces seem gorgeous in this presentation. Very well done.  Mannington Phil
0385333846|5.0|Billy Pilgrim, the main character of this story, was a soldier in World War 2, a time traveller, a visitor of a distant planet, a husband and, among other things, a proud father. He was also a living witness of the tragic bombing of the city of Dresden. What else could have happened to this man? A lot. And everything is told in an incredibly simple but profound way, full of irony and wisdom. The author shows he's a master in blending humor and tragedy, always paying deep respect for the victims of war's horrors.  So it goes.
0891419063|5.0|This was a wonderful book. I do not know much about the battles of the Pacific Theater. Sledge did an amazing job of not getting too technical but still describing the battles and misery of the soldiers who foughtPeleliu and Okinawa. I have such an appreciation for the Marines and the job they did. You have to wonder about McArthur after reading the book. What a waste of life. So many young men who gave their lives at Peleliu and for what.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|I love this game! Funny script, amusing gameplay, decent graphics! OpenFeint Achievements make the replay value great for me!    Runs great on my HTC Thunderbolt!
B004UXUSIM|3.0|There is no doubting Woody Allen's talent but recently his films have not measured up to his talents.  Midnight in Paris is his most recent effort and clearly a vast improvement over his previous ones.  The movie is well written --  at least the flashback scenes -- and the cinematography outstanding.  The film itself reflects Woody Allen's love affair with the decades between the end of WW I and WW II.  He showcases some of the litierary and artistic luminaries of the period although he presumes his audience is not only familiar with the works of these characters but of their peresonalities and history as well.  Consequently this film is probably wasted on much of todays audience who probably would not know who Zelda is much less her sad history or Gertrude Stein as well.  However, the Hemingway character is not only well done and well acted but gives some humor and authenticity to the flashbacks.  The lead character in the film does a good job but seems an unlikely candidate as an author of any talent or motivation.  But as usual in films coming out of Hollywood there has to be a villain and that villain must be a businessman and a Republican -- preferably some sort of extremist totally out of touch with civilization and taste. Woody just couldn't try something original like making the villain an extreme liberal so he throws in references to the Tea Party and Republicans as the Neanderthals they are in the eyes of the East Coast and Hollywood liberals  - real villains in his eyes.<br /><br />The movie itself gets off to a great start with an unlikely premise of time travel but that creates problems with the ending.  It seems obvious that whole point of the movie was to bring some of these characters to life in a contemporary environment but that complicated the ending which seemed very forced.  Overall this was a great improvement over recent Allen efforts.  It is enjoyable but not worthy of seeing a second time.
0743270754|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin does a masterful job on this book about our beloved sixteenth President and his adversarial peers.  Lincoln's honest and sincere character shines through on each page.  His political genius is very apparent and shows why he is our countries greatest President.  There is so much to learn in this book-it should be near the top of any one's reading list on U.S. history.  A very complex and incredible tale.  Highly recommended!
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I have been disappointed with several inferior products that I have purchased in the past to use with my iPhone without having to remove my Otterbox case.  Some that will charge but not play on my dock...or play but not charge.  I had resorted to using travel speakers plugged into the headphone jack and keeping it plugged into the wall to keep it charged rather than being able to use my Onkyo system and iDock that has a much better sound.<br /><br />This pass through lives up to everything that it was advertised to do.  Right out of the box I saw that the quality of the product was above expectation.  This is hard mold acrylic rather than soft shrink wrap protecting the components.  The base is wide to offer stability when your iPhone/iPod is docked and lessens the stress on the connection.  The product charges and plays as indicated in the description.<br /><br />I am very happy with this product and will recommend it to everyone I know who doesn't want to have to remove their case to use their dock systems.
B005529BDK|4.0|simple game, easy to grasp. works great on the galaxy tab. only complaint is a lack of more modes, there are four modes, but all four are fairly similar.
B000I0QM04|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this, but my family and I loved it.  The visuals are amazing, pure vintage sci fi.  Gorgeous!  Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow and the other actors are so much fun to watch in these roles and they are also easy on the eyes.  This is a really fun, really beautiful movie to watch, and the technology behind it is fascinating.  Rent it on the cheap, you'll have fun.  We bought the blu ray version on sale and it really enhanced the visuals, if that is your main interest.  Highly recommended!
B003YFIUW8|2.0|This book was difficult to get into.  I couldnt read it for more than 20 minutes at a time, due to it being told fro. the kids eyes.  It is an neat approach, but did not live up to all the hype.
B000PD3LIA|5.0|Like many others, I heard about this band from the Kill Bill credits.  I picked it up expected more like Malagueña Salerosa and got it!  The sound this band puts out is, as I describe it, flamenco/rock.  Three or four guitars -- electric, classical, acoustic, and bass -- feature prominently in their songs.  There is only one English language song on the album with the rest being in Spanish or simply instrumental.    The guitar work is clearly something they're quite proud of, and deservingly.  Like many other guitar bands, they often channel harmonizing guitars individually to the left and right channel.  I quite enjoy the vocals provided by Alex Ruiz (of Del Castillo).  He's got a nice voice and sings both languages quite well.    I have 2 gripes about this album.  The first is on the song \\"Mexican Sausage Link.\\"  The trumpet player is too loud and trying to be loud in it.  The offending part is only about 1 minute of the song, but that makes it my least favorite song on the album.  The second is that the album is too short.  Clocking in at a little over 45 minutes, it leaves me wanting a few more tracks before the album rewinds to the beginning again.    In summary, with 10 2/3 of 11 tracks being excellent, outstanding guitar and vocal work, and a fantastic flamenco/rock sound, I highly recommend this album.  Here's hoping they make a second album.
B004XQO90E|4.0|Watched Source Code earlier today, the only regret I have is that I did not see it on the big screen for the full effect. I could not look away, it held my attention from beginning to end, every time Colter went through the 8 minutes, I did too.  It was not repetitive, the science may be unrealistic but isn't that the definition of science fiction?   I hope there would be a sequel since the ending itself took a final twist but I hope against hope because unfortunately the movie reviewing public is too caught up in being challenged by special effects via 3d movies or mindless sequels. We've become too lazy to used our brain cells for movies filled with good story telling and good acting.   I am showing my age but it did remind of the Hitchcock movies with the great music and the way the audience knew before the character did.  I wanted to tell Colter no, no, its ......!    Job well done Mr. Jones, your Dad I'm sure is proud.

0880793589|5.0|I'd recommend these cards to anyone wanting to increase their creative output. Or anyone just needing a jog in the right direction.    These cards are a condensed summary of Roger's work, and give you must faster access than having to go diving into a book every time you want input.    According to Roger, the are four creativity archetypes:    . Explorer  . Artist  . Judge  . Warrior    And these outline the main approaches to creativity. The color of the cards indicates which aspect is being used, but you it's not easy to recall...
B001AGXEAG|5.0|The movie was in perfect condition when I got it, and it was exactly what I had on mind. For 5 dollars I definitely can not complain!
0061784788|4.0|This was a pretty good read overall.  If you like the other Sigma Force novels (or any James Rollins for that matter), that is, books with a National Treasure/Indiana Jones type spin on them then they'll be right up your alley.<br /><br />Many have gone into the plot so I won't bother to summarize that here.  Some have said it's the best Rollins novel yet, some didn't care too much for it.  It is what it is.  I found it to be a middle of the road type book.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the mixing of science with the historical aspects of the novel.  Nanotechnology, the founding of our Nation, ancient Native American Tribes gone missing, prophecies of doom, moles in the government, crisis with earth shattering consequences; nobody does this quite like James Rollins.  What you end up with his a continent spanning mystery thriller with lots of action.<br /><br />I did have a few issues with the book though.  Sometimes I found it a little flat.  Not the best description I can come up with but it seemed like the villain was rather boiler plate.  A dark figure from a secret society bent on finding the very same thing the protagonists are trying to find, both for very different reasons.  The villain in this book, while a pretty evil son of a gun wasn't quite fleshed out enough.  Sure, his methods were extreme and his motivations were made clear, we just didn't know enough about the man himself to really feel him jump off the page.<br /><br />Another issue are the impossible situations.  I know they're a staple of this series but sometimes they just come off as a little obvious in that we know what's going to happen before we read it.  Really, just my two cents.  As I said, it's something I can't quite put my finger on.<br /><br />Overall though I thought the book was good and worth the time to read.  The science fact and historical facts alone are worth the read.  Truly there was a lot going on during the founding of our country that isn't exactly taught in social studies ;)

B004EPYZUI|2.0|Very disappointed when I watched Sucker Punch. I was expecting a lot more action and story. You should know before hand there absolutely no plot to this film. And you will be watching the movie just for eye candy alone. Unfortunately there was not enough action scenes to qualify the movie as an Action movie. It's very slow moving and very bad acting. It's so bad in fact it's actually annoying every time an actor speaks. I give this two stars because their some nice visuals. Overall I would not even reccommend watching this movie.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|No one sings like Susan and no one plays like Derek. They have put together one hell of a band.
0062073567|4.0|Reading this book felt like playing the board game Clue on the pages -- was it Mr. White in the dining room with the dagger?<br /><br />When Dr. Sheppard's friend Roger Ackroyd is murdered, everyone is a suspect. Hercule Poirot comes on the scene and the reader is drawn along, seeing only what Dr. Sheppard sees and never fully understanding what the miraculous Poirot is about to uncover. Dr. Sheppard's sister, the village gossip is a welcome, light-hearted addition to the story. Blackmail, drug use, neighborhood snoops, mysterious phone calls and betrayal all play a part in this wonderful mystery.
B001HN69AY|5.0|If you're a fan of Terry Gilliam films, you will not be disappointed. Heath Ledger worked with Gilliam on The Brothers Grimm, leading them to this wonderful fantasy. Sadly, Heath passed away during the production of the film. Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell stepped up to the plate, helping to finish the film in a very unique and creative way! It is well worth watching and yes, it is an odd film. Weird is good.
B0006Z2KYI|5.0|...And I've watched it a dozen times.  Lubitsch shows his incredible comic range, as masterful at black comedy here as he was at touching romantic comedy in \\"Shop Around the Corner.\\"  Benny's greatest performance, and Lombard is at her best as well.  A must see.

B0034G4ORC|4.0|This movie rocked!  Very simple story line.  We are attacked by aliens because of Earth's resources.  The concept of how they arrived, and started kicking butt was great.  The FX on this movie were incredible.  If you like lots of action and special effects, fight for survival, this movie is for you.  If you are looking for complex story line, then watch something else.

B003E6K1VK|5.0|I have a 2007 vintage Intel Core 2 Duo Macbook laptop.  I tried the FiiO E7 and found it greatly improves the sound when I listen on powered speakers or my AKG Q701 headphones.  When I plug into the Macbook's headphone jack, the sound is tinny in comparison. I set the bass control on the E7 to +1, and that works fine for me.  My only comment, is it would be cool if someone came up with a slick way to attach the E7 to my Macbook when listening, as there would be one less thing dangling.  The E7 did come with a rubber strap to make attachment to an iPod or iPhone easy (via an optional connector).
0062060554|3.0|The situation in this novel is unique---the narrator as an amnesiac who has little to no short term memory. I did, however, figure out what was going on a little more than halfway into the novel. Also, the ending ties things up a little too neatly---on the order of a Lifetime movie or one of Sidney Sheldon's novels. This book was entertaining. I finished it within one day.  However, don't read it expecting anything deep.
B002IFT1ZA|3.0|There will be no sugar coating in this review. After the first episode, I had to take my rose colored glasses off. Judging the series on its own merits. It deserves the criticism of being politically correct. Spoiler alert: I found it extremely distasteful to turn Renly gay. Obviously, HBO injected a truckload of money into the production and it shows. That money could not overshadow some of the horrid acting in this series. Compared to the novels, the story is pretty accurate except for the lack of wolves. I have no doubt that this series will be lauded not by its own merits, but by the strength of the novels.
B004VUP8WK|3.0|First off, Illud should be rated by itself as an independent work from Morbid.  Don't bother evaluating it against any previous CD or any other of Morbid's line-up, it's a fallacy from the start and disappointment will probably result.    Illud is refreshing in the sense that it distinguishes itself from the repetitive overly commercialized version of death/black metal spewing world-wide as something unique, artistic and talented.  While listening at least three different moods evolve throughout:  Speed, Angst Melody and Power Tension.      On the downside, and what I can only attribute as originated from the recent inclusion of Yueng and the reintroduction of Vincent, there are several points that stand out as being forced layering or overproduction.  MA should have put it all down after the last mix, and went camping for a couple months before returning to sign-off with a fresh pair of ears.  For example, Blades for Baal is bifurcated in an attempt to produce a thematic rendition where Marduk meets the symphony, but Vincent can't even pronounce Baal correctly.      And that opens up another issue, the ego is so thick throughout Illud that a listener has to ask how they made it through, but then the overproduction/engineering is probably the bandaid.  Destructhor?  When a man hits 30 it's time to leave the cartoon nicknames behind and represent yourself, stand or fall on your laurels without hiding behind a moniker to entice sales to a pre-teen market.      Some of Vincent's lyrical content at times appears forced to fit around Yeung and Trey, but it's simplistic approach at rhyming the last word of each phrase with the prior only served as a distraction from the other's.      Immediately prior to Illud, Trey was death metal's number one guitarist; Yueng the top drummer; Vincent top vox and with Illud they are stepping all over each other's dicks trying to assert who has the biggest when less would have been more.     This is a good CD by some great, talented musicians.  Perhaps if they can survive a tour and their respective egos, maturity will bring out another piece of work that truly represents their talent.     FYI:  Touring in EU and Central America before America sucks balls in my opinion.  Where were the EU fans in 1989 when the US fans carried MA, held MA and stood by MA????
B004LROMSO|4.0|Underrated is the best description of this series. There has been so much hatred compared to Game of Thrones. There is no disputing the superior story of the latter. This series however has better acting and actual intrique. The changes are refreshing. There is even a taste of T&A tossed in for good measure. I will admit that the season finale was not thought out. The journey was quite entertaining.
B000002LND|5.0|All Madonnas greatest hits. the quality of the CD is \\"good\\", not excellent, but well worth the investment if you are interested in her music.
0670215821|5.0|Robert Mason puts you with him in the cockpit of his Huey during months of combat flying in Vietnam.  I did about three years as a Marine grunt officer in country and I knew I hated being in a bird but the reading of this book leaves me wondering how any Army Warrant Officer Huey pilot survived his 12 month tour.  This is the best of the books I've read by the guys who did this work.  The valour of these guys was made tragic by a nation of politicians who never had a plan for victory and just required the slaughter to go on rather than take up their responsibility to weigh what COULD be done and the value of that against the price in death.
0307272702|5.0|After fighting the weight problem all of my 69 years, I had rather low expectations from still another author/expert! Yet, Mr. Taubes demonstrated rather quickly how wrong the conventional thinking and teaching has been for so very long. I started following his suggested changes to my eating habits with an anticipation not present for years. During the past seven weeks, I have never felt hunger and yet have dropped 22 pounds....the rate is now about 2-3 pounds lost per week. I couldn't be happier and my copy of the book is continually loaned to friends (I'll never look at suger the same way again)! Thank you, Mr. Taubes.

B000E33W1C|1.0|This review is only for the disc, not the movie.<br /><br />I bought this DVD back in 2009 and left it sitting unopened on a shelf with my other DVDs. Last night I finally opened the package for the first time and tried to watch it and the disc wouldn't even play. Started stuttering in the opening scene and never got better. After 5 minutes of the movie stuttering and jumping around I finally turned it off. Very aggravating.<br /><br />Thinking it might be the DVD player I got out my old DVD player that I'd recently replaced with a blu ray player and tried to play it on that one as well with the same result.<br /><br />Bottom line, the disk is defective/poor quality. Seeing as I bought this 2 years ago I'm not very confident that Amazon would even consider replacing it so I'm just going to have to eat the loss.<br /><br />Can't recommend this product at all. I'd give it zero stars if possible.
0545265355|5.0|SOMETHING ABOUT THIS SERIES STUCK WITH ME FROM THE OPENING LINE OF THE BOOK TO THE VERY END OF THE LAST BOOK. I GOT THEM ONE YEAR FOR CHRISTMAS AND HAVE READ THEM THREE TIMES SINCE THEN. AMAZING BOOKS AND IF YOUR LOOKING FOR SOME EXCITEMENT IN YOUR LIFE YOU SHOULD PICK THEM UP NOW. CANT WAIT FOR THE MOVIES TO START COMING OUT
B001MEJY8W|5.0|I watched this review from an interesting viewpoint. I'm an adult female, early 30s, who happened to be very alone in a dark house in the mountains when I saw it. I knew what was coming because I read the synopsis before viewing. It STILL changed the way I look at the genre.<br /><br />**moderate spoilers**<br /><br />\\"Torture Porn\\" is a perjorative term.  I think there's no way you can separate having to see the torture. It's effective. We're not talking about a pack of savages or thugs a la I Spit On Your Grave - the protagonists in this movie were executing this nastiness from the same pedestal Eli Roth's hostel elite operate from. That's what makes it terrifying. Old, rich European people are supposed to be eating crumpets and passing their grandkids off to nannies. But I say that because I'm American. That angle actually makes this movie more terrifying for me.<br /><br />**spoilers over**<br /><br />This one will stick with you. If you have a problem with torture, gratuitous violence, force feeding - don't watch it. If you have a high moral compass to the point where you find watching something you don't agree with is going to make you have a Billy Graham hissy fit Amazon style, don't watch it. But if you decide to, know this movie is going to push your boundaries and - if your experience is anything like mine - it'll keep you looking over your shoulder when you walk through the yard at night by yourself. It's profoundly challenging, hard to watch, and extremely disturbing.<br /><br />That being said, I made it through the whole thing while sitting by myself, alone in a house in the woods on a dark night. If I can do that without fast forwarding through the worst scenes, you know you're not really dealing with A Serbian Film or anything. But regardless of how you feel about Martyrs at the time, it will absolutely stick with you. It's haunting. Don't say I didn't warn you.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|THE BEST ALBUM BRITNEY AS PUT OUT IN ALL HER CAREER AND I LOVED EVERY ALBUM BEFORE THIS BUT THIS ONE JUST STANDS HIGH ABOVE THE REST...EVERY SONG COULD BE PLAYING IN A CLUB RIGHT NOW OVER AND OVER..MAKES YOU WANT TO DANCE AND HAVE FUN FROM THE START TO THE END. DONT THINK TWICE ABOUT GETTIN THIS ONE CAUSE ITS WELL WORTH THE MONEY WITH THE EXTRA SONGS ON IT. BRITNEY'S BEST AND IF YOUR A TRUE FAN YOU WILL GET IT
B001EAWMGA|1.0|A delightful premise, and one that could have been very rewarding had there not been an utter lack of skilled directing , plausible dialogue and even the most marginal of competent acting.  Well, by that I mean everyone save the protagonist who behaved as if he was reading his lines off a teleprompter for the very first time each scene...everyone else did much better.  But really, deplorable...and such a shame too, as they obviously had some money to play with, but it truly was a complete, tragic mess.
B004LWZW24|5.0|Me and my sister watched this the other night and was scared to death after it. I usually dont watch a movie if it says its supposed to be the scariest movie since The Exorcist...but believe me this passes that movie and every scary movie by a mile. Watch it and keep the lights on when you do
B0052VUNHC|3.0|This book was OK.  The story was not your average relationship between two people.  It's refreshing to see something different for a change.      Travis really reminded me of one of the boys from the Jersey Shore with his sex with different women every night.  I, personally think that is disgusting, so I did not really care for the book in that sense.  But, over all, it was a good story line.  I really hated the ending though...that was just dumb. I would recommend someone else to read this book if you are a fan of sex and violence.    I do not understand how the picture cover fits into the story.  Would anyone like to explain?
B0041KKYDI|5.0|Just finished watching this film . I wanted and needed to distance myself from the film until now . I was too aware of Aron's story to be interested in a fictionalization . I'd read it all (journalistically) . I'd seen Mr. Ralston on the talk shows . Danny was a known to me . I'd seen and loved his 28 DAYS LATER in theaters and loved it . I quite enjoyed SUNSHINE when i saw that in movie theaters . My wife had introduced me to the very good MILLIONS , which is one of her favorite pictures . I'd only chozen to see Mr. Franco in the first SPIDERMAN film (owing to Willem Dafoe's participation). The 2nd and 3rd of those films held little interest for me (save Alfred Molina) in the 2nd film . I had high expectations . The critics had planted them there . In my opinion , this was certainly one of the five best mainstream pictures of it's year of nomination(s) , non genre . DO check it out when you're ready . Excellent .
B0042816YK|2.0|I just read the book and went right out and got the movie hoping that it would enhance my experience reading the book.  I am so disappointed.  The book is funny and the people are likable.  This movie is heavy, slow and so sad.  I was bored and a few times so tired of Julia Roberts (even though I like her).  This is a hollywoodtised book/movie that does not work. Sorry, I really wanted to like it.  Loved loved the book.
B00006LLLN|5.0|This double cd was well worth waiting for. I was totally blown away with its content and would certainly recomend this cd to be added to any collection one would have.
B0041KKYGU|3.0|I had fun watching \\"Bad Teacher.\\" It's not a great film by any means, and I don't plan on repeated viewings, but it was enjoyable to watch once.<br /><br />What's interesting about the film is that it's about a character that is completely morally reprehensible, and yet still comes across as likable. Much of this probably has to do with Cameron Diaz, who is just such a likable actress. She's a beautiful woman with a knockout figure and a mega-watt smile, and yet she's so goofy and willing to make fun of herself that even when she's playing nasty characters it's hard not to find her charming.<br /><br />And boy is this character nasty. She's greedy, she's lazy, and she's selfish. She lies, she steals, she manipulates. What's also interesting is that the storyline of the repugnant central character, Elizabeth, does not fall into either of the two clich&eacute;s that you'd expect from a Hollywood film:<br /><br />1) She does not end up finding herself inspired by the children and discover a love of teaching, revealing a heart of gold hidden beneath her prickly exterior.<br /><br />2) She does not find herself getting her comeuppance for being such an awful human being.<br /><br />If anything, the characters in the film who are depicted as truly pathetic are Elizabeth's sincere, hardworking fellow teachers. Is this a dubious message? Perhaps. But the performers are all so funny and likable (Lucy Punch and Justin Timberlake are both hilarious) that they manage to make up for the film's many flaws.
0981951244|5.0|This is an incredible book if you are like me and want to eliminate the bad habits that are holding you back from achieving your goals fast and using your full abilities.  God gives us unreal capabilities, some follow the devil and get on drugs, others follow the books recommendations and soar beyond their wildest dreams.  I prefer to soar rather than sleep in the shadows, high on drugs.   Not a book on drugs, but it saddens me to see all these drug addicts on the streets when they have been given great capabilities.    The negative reviews must be from the author's competitors because I have read a lot of goal/motivation books, and this one is the best.   I really like the forms that are on his website that have helped me to focus and eliminate bad habits so I can achieve ANY goal!  It is sad that some people, probably competitors, give this book a bad review.    NOTE:  Those with bad views have no Amazon Verified Sale (I doubt they read the book), but those like me, with positive reviews, have an Amazon Verified Sale!
B004XIQIPQ|2.0|I was a bit underwhelmed by AM's latest release. The album as a whole has a 'feel good' bubble gum sound that does little justice to the talent in the band.    I really enjoyed the first three albums. In particular, the last album, Humbug, had a slew of richly layered tracks such as Dance Little Liar, Secret Door, Jeweller's Hands, Cornerstone just to name a few. In stark contrast to the musical depth and raw energy of its predecessors(especially Humbug and Favorite Worst Nightmare), 'Suck it and See' reminds me of dime a dozen American bands dotting the alternative rock landscape. Apart from the first track '....Thunderstorm' and 'All my own stunts', the rest of the album is pretty bland.    AM are an incredibly talented band and can do much better. I can only hope the band will regroup and bounce back with an album that matches the quality of it pre-2011 albums.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I grew up watching the original Hawaii Five-O in the 1970's. It has always been one of my favorite shows. I was a bit skeptical when I heard a new version of the show was coming out. But to my surpise, it has turned out to be a great Tv show. Of course things are more updated than the original show,  but that is to be expected. If you are a fan of the original series, I think you'll like the new version as well.
014028009X|5.0|A must read.  One of the first in an emerging genre of women's literature, spiritual autobiography.  Another wonderful read which takes this genre to even greater heights is \\"How the Universe Made Love to Petal Andersohn.\\" Highly recommended!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I have a heck of a time waking up even when I get a full night of sleep. I always hit the alarm and go back to sleep without even remembering I had woken up. This lets me wake up to any song I want on my phone while I solve a handful of math problems. It is very customizable. Several snooze/shut off methods and alarm sound options. So thankful for this application.
B005529BDK|2.0|What else can I say? It was fun the first few times, but then it got boring and didn't work well.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This thing is amazing! I also sharpened all my serrated knives too! This sharpener does the job quick and to the point! Lol. Buy it- it's inexpensive and it works perfectly.
1607886278|1.0|This is a review of the audiobook only.     I wanted to like this. I really did. The trouble, for me, was the shrill, overly earnest, 'childlike' voice of Jack. It was like listening to someone's outgoing voicemail message recorded by their kid. Only a thousand times worse. It has the arch, knowing quality of an adult wrapped in the faux innocence of a little kid's falsetto. Perhaps other people won't have the same problem, but for me, it was like nails on a chalkboard. I gave up and ejected the CD after 10 minutes. Too bad I didn't order the book instead.
B0058P7KUA|3.0|at first I thought this would seem like a nice game but.. its not working at all. don't know what's up but im sure this game is awesome!
0316067938|5.0|LOVED,LOVED,LOVED this book, just as I LOVED Twilight , New Moon and Eclipse!!! I am a person who reads books to escape reality and enjoy happy endings, so I am estactic that everything worked out for everyone.  I LOVE that Bella got it all, and that things will work out for Jacob also. I don't get the negative reviews...this is fiction.  This is not suposed to be reality.  Don't we get enough bad news and sad stories in real life?  Thank you to Stephanie Meyers for an AWESOME ending! I just wish Mrs. Meyers would continue to write about these caracters I have come to enjoy so much...maybe about Jacob and Renesme and a conflict with the half human/half vampire male? And definitely please publish Midnight Sun! Don't listen to the negative reviews, READ THIS BOOK!!!
B000TLMWMY|5.0|This dvd brings back so many memoires when I was a child. My family never were country music lovers but we never missed The Johnny Cash show. The Man In Black was the ruler for wich all others was messured. This is a wonderfull dvd. A must to have!
0307454541|3.0|I liked the story, it's interesting and fun to read. I always wanted to know what happened next but there are 3 things I didn't like which made me give it only 3 stars.<br /><br />1) The story was kind of predictable. It's not that I knew from the beginning what was going to happen but I had a good idea of how things would turn and I was right.<br />2) The part I like the least is how so many things that happen, if not almost everything, are too unrealistic. To name a few, Blomkvist's daughter religious involvement, Lisbeth's \\"photographic memory\\" which actually doesn't exist in real life as presented in the story, the way he was able to recognize every single blurry face in the pictures he had. Also there are too many unrelated, unimportant, and barely mentioned events that are extremely important for the mystery to be solved, Lisbeth's previous sexual assault, etc, etc, etc. All those things just came out of nowhere were never mentioned again.<br />3) The other thing I really hated was the author's advertising throughout the book. I already don't movies like that, now I really hate reading it. I really don't care knowing what the characters' laptop brands are, which programs they use to do their jobs and their respective website, or which email provider they use. Not only did I not like it but it really annoyed me. This is something that wanted to make me stop reading.
B000LB7G00|5.0|I've owned one of these for years and now I can't run a CAD without it. I was first introduced to a 3D mouse when I was interning in college. After that internship I was never able to navigate a CAD without one. I ended up purchasing a few of these for work and home. If you are into 3D design or 3D CAD this device is a must.
1609419693|4.0|I enjoyed learning about Tina Fey's family, especially her father. Interesting to find out how she got into tv work and what improv is all about.   The CD is good for traveling to work or for a long car trip.
1594744769|5.0|This book was just fabulous. It was a complete surprise and I found it incredibly refreshing. The book combines actual antique photos with a fantastically woven storyline. The peculiar children grabbed onto my heart and lead me through each page. I highly recommend it!
0545128285|5.0|Loved it! Loved it! Loved it! Rowling did not disappoint this Harry Potter fanatic, but it is hard to live up to such high expectations.<br /><br />It was interesting to see fairy tales from the wizarding world. Children are brought up to believe in the wonderful happy ending of fairy tales instead of the true lessons they are meant to teach. That is what Rowling does with this book.<br /><br />She allows readers into the mind Dumbledore in a way that we have never been invited. Not only are we privileged enough to read the wizard fairy tales but also Dumbledore's personal thoughts on them.<br /><br />It was just enjoyable. I also enjoyed Rowling's art work. It isn't professional level, but I found it more personal.
B00501X6YG|4.0|What does Fly From Here sound like? Does it sound like Close to the Edge, Relayer, Going for the One, Drama, or 90125? Does it matter? To fans of Jon Anderson and/or Rick Wakeman and/or the \\"classic line-up of the such and such era\\" it probably does matter, however these fans will most likely not be swayed no matter what. Due to the time wasting arguments and squabbling between the members of Yes and the even more nasty squabbling between the fans about the viability of a Jon Anderson and/or Rick Wakeman-less Yes on fan sites and message boards, not to mention cancelled tours such as the More Drama or the Close to the Edge and Back tour, I was becoming weary of being a Yes fan. I just did not think they had it in them for another recording no matter who was playing on it and even if they did, I doubted they would ever get it together to make it a reality or even moreso that I would want to listen to it.    And now we have Fly From Here. As stated above, when asked \\"What does FFH sound like?\\", well, it sounds like Yes in 2011! People will hear snippets of various line-ups and recordings (I hear snippets of Drama, a bit of 90125 and Big Generator, with some of the pop sensibilities of Asia). Once you listen to FFH, you will come up with your own ideas of what era/line-up it reminds you of.    Although FFH does not achieve the musical or popular heights of either the Fragile/CTTE or 90125 era, it delivers a sturdy set of quality songs that comprise a thoughtful, consistent offering that I had no reason to expect to be as good as it is. The FFH suite (based on the Drama-era song Fly From Here) is cohesive if a bit lacking in instrumental virtuosity as the instrumental fireworks of the 70s era (remember 'Soundchaser'?) are not as present on this cd. Instead of striving for who can outdo each other with instrumental virtuosity within a song (and stepping all over each other in the process), the emphasis is on economy (IMO none of the songs or musical ideas overstay theirwelcome), and the melodic flow of the songs themselves. Part I 'We Can Fly From Here' is as gorgeous as anything produced by the band from 1997 onwards. All of the themes in the Overture (note the snare drum rolls of reminiscent of 'White Car' midway through), are revisited throughout the suite and the lyrics about aviation and relationships make a nice theme to base this musical suite around.    Strangely enough, the songs I find myself gravitating the most towards on FFH are the straightforward, soothing pop of both 'The Man You Always Wanted Me To Be' co-written by Chris Squire and 'Hour of Need' written by Steve Howe as they just sound 'different' to me for some reason. In a sense, some might say these songs are representative of the pop sensibilities of the latter-day reunited Asia being interpreted in a Yes context. No matter, I just hear some lyrically thoughtful compositions with some gorgeous chord progressions and melodies. These songs are not the pop found on 90125 as they tend towards a current, mature MOR sound more than 80s pop (or even 70s progressive rock for that matter) which leads me to wonder what else Steve and Chris could have come up with for Yes in this setting. 'Life on a Film Set' was written by the Buggles themselves, and although the first half of this song plods along a bit slowly, the second half is a joyous dance. Steve's solo piece 'Solitaire' while skillfully and very tastily executed lacks some of the energy of his other solo pieces such as 'Second Initial' or 'Sketches In the Sun' (not to mention 'The Clap' and 'Mood for a Day').    The dipthong bass pedal sound from 'On The Silent Wings Of Freedom' from Tormato makes an appearance on 'Into the Storm', the cd's energetic closer that may remind some of 'Tempus Fugit'. Benoit David, instead of trying to be Jon Anderson, actually finds his own voice within the band and if comparisons must be made, Benoit sounds more like Trevor Horn than Jon. Speaking of Trevor Horn, getting him to produce this cd (as well as having Geoff Downes rejoin the band) was nothing short of genius. Trevor's production gives the songs room to breathe while adding some polish and sheen without being overproduced.    If this is to be Yes' last recording, then this is a very worthy effort as such (well, for me at least). Although there might not be the one or more songs that just 'blow you away' on the first listen of this album, I will trade that for the consistency, economy, maturity, and thoughtfulness of FFH's set of songs. If you are able to embrace the concept of Yesmusic being more than the specific line-up of who plays on a specific recording in a specific time period, hopefully you will too!
B003EVFHYG|3.0|Few film scores work as standalones, and this is no exception. The usual bombast with a few interesting passages... Track 9 has a nice Irish step dance feel.
0060245867|5.0|My kids and I loved the book from the first time we read it !!!. I have been buying it for all my friends even for my 30 year old sister who has no kids yet but I knew she'd love it and she does. Simple, catchy, funny and very entertaining
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I admit I found this book very entertaining. A great summer read with some amusing takes on the now-familiar supernatural romance genre.  I appreciated that the female lead was an adult woman with her own life and abilities.    Disappointingly, despite her intelligence and alleged athletic ability, the main character was constantly swooning and needing rescue by the male lead.  (I'm being deliberately vague here to avoid spoilers)  This is a pretty tired way to write a romantic heroine and I'd hoped for better given the set up.  I also saw no point in the abstinence theme.  I hope the author gives her main character a little more oomph in later installments.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|One of the most memorable heroines and most engaging anti-heroes I've ever read!  I could not wait til this book came out, and it didn't disappoint!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Pros:  -Carbide Slot: This stripped the metal very quickly off my knives, which was exactly what I needed. It gave a paper-shaving, sharp edge to dull knives, some of which were duller than a butter knife.   -Ceramic Slots: This slowly strips metal off the edge, so it's good for knives that need a light touch-up.   -Diamond Rod: This is supposed to sharpen serrations. I haven't had to use this feature yet, but if I do, I'll make an update.  -Versatile: with the three functions above, it seems like this can give a basic sharpening treatment to virtually any knife.   -Portable: This thing can literally fit in my pocket, so I can take it anywhere I go if I wanted to.  -Effective: I sharpened a few really dull knives with this to the point where they could pass water bottle cutting tests and where they could shave paper.  -Price: I think this was a very good purchase, especially for the price I paid, which was less than $10.    Cons:  -To use this, you need to have good endurance for your fingers and strength to keep this from wiggling around as you drag your blades through the slots. It gives a somewhat small area to grip it, which is why it may be a little awkward to use. However, remember this is because it's supposed to fit in your pocket.    Overall, this thing got the job I wanted done, and I think a sharpener like this for less than $10 to maintain my knives indefinitely is a pretty good deal. Plus, it's very easy to use, and virtually anyone should be able to use this, even if they have no sharpening experience. Personally, I've had no sharpening experience, but I like how this product was designed for anyone to maintain their knives. Thumbs up to Smith's Abrasives.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|Over all I like the watch and it works well. I have only two complains. One it is rather big for me and doesn't fit very well (I am 5'8'' 125lb). And second the battery drains rather quickly if you don't leave it on the dock, I didn't turn off the GPS though.
B002QW7AJY|5.0|To qualify a review, it is often helpful to know a bit about the reviewer. I am a 40 something male, technical professional, former engineer, military historian (amateur), science fiction lover, future-war fiction afficionado (Tom Clancy, et.al), and I dig a good romance. I play an occasional mainstream survival-horror video game.    My opinion is that this movie was very entertaining to watch.  I have not read many other reviews posted here, so I am not choosing a camp.    I liked mainly the concept of what the colony ship was, and the interesting premise of the scenario confronting the crew. It is clear that the plot was very specifically intended to be confusing until the situation reveals itself. I can certainly see that someone might be a bit overwhelmed by that, but it should be understood that was the POINT. So, if you DO feel overwhelmed, it worked. And if you turn the movie off before the very end, you'll NEVER get it.  People are, by culture, extremely impatient.    The movie is a combination of Alien, Memento, Fight Club, and any of the zombie films, real psycho-horror.  I am a sucker for heavy sci-fi which this certainly is.  I also like that it is a microcosm of evolution and survival of the fittest (though it is easy to question the logic of the situation, it is what it is, and who is to say what is reasonable) but some of the continuity may not hold up to scrutiny very well. I can't say too much more without spoiling it, but, there are many, many parts of the movie that would require explanation, that aren't explained.  But that is what makes it art. Just because there IS an explanation for it doesn't mean we understand it, and have the correct explanation, much like our own existence.    It would be interesting to see a movie that continued the story.
B002XMGGK6|4.0|This was a much better revenge film than I thought it would be.  Lots of twists and turns that I was not expecting from the Butler character.<br /><br />I like Gerard Butler, Jamie Foxx, Colm Meaney, Bruce McGill and Josh Stewart, which were all the main reasons that I watched this film.  And I'm glad that I did because most of the actors turned a mediocre plot into a good movie.  Butler was great in his role as the vengeance-driven engineer with a secret past.  Foxx was not so great - wooden, one-dimensional (if he'd been on the top of his game, this would have been a stellar movie).  The others were great in their supporting roles.<br /><br />The ending could have been more fitting to the direction the rest of the film went but I enjoyed it.<br /><br />NOTE:  Lots of violence, rape scene, language, torture.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|What can I say?  Some will hate her because of her success and some will love the messages she gives through song.  If you love to hate her that's fine too .... but she will always have dedicated fans such as myself.  Love it !
B002ZG98C8|5.0|I love Danny Trejo as a character actor and have for years.  It's about time that he got a lead role - and I'm glad that it is in \\"Machete\\" - a role that fits him perfectly.<br /><br />What a rock 'em, sock 'em, cut 'em up movie - loads of grindhouse fun.  Trejo was perfect as the ex-Federale vigilante freedom fighter.  Oh, and of course, ladies' man!  The cast is full of big names and beautiful women.  The dialogue goes between bigoted, political vitriol and over-the-top sound bites.<br /><br />Violence - and I do mean violence which includes blood, GUTS, and everything in between; nudity; drugs.  Do you get the hint that this isn't a children's film?<br /><br />But I loved it for what it was - a tribute to drive-in movies, splatter films, Mexploitation films, maybe chambara films.  And let's have Trejo in more lead roles!
0553381695|5.0|Perhaps some of my enthusiasm is coming off reading this immediately after watching HBO's terrific adaption of Game of Thrones, but I enjoyed this even more than the first. The book is denser, and definitely grander in scope, with the final third of the book culminating in war. If you loved the series, but didn't read the first book, I guarantee you can jump right in and know who everyone is without missing a beat. For me, this series is shaping up to surpass Tolkein's classic, 'Lord of the Rings', or Robert Jordan's epic, but bloated Wheel of Time saga.
B004EPZ070|4.0|Part of me doesn't want to admit that I really enjoyed this movie, mostly because of the cheating involved.  I read some bad reviews but had wanted to see it before that, so I went anyway, but didn't expect much.  I ended up REALLY enjoying it!  It was funny, had really interesting relationship dynamics I thought, including great chemistry between Ginnifer and Colin. The Office guy was hilarious!  I didn't know what was going to happen, so it was kind of an emotional roller coaster the first time I saw it (went twice in theater which is rare for me also).  I read the book after, and actually didn't like it as much as the movie.  Definitely buying it!
B002ZG976U|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. My husband liked it. I love Cher & Christina Aguilera as singers. Christina isn't going to win any awards for her acting but it wasn't so bad that I couldn't get into the movie. I loved the songs & dancing. I love burlesque anyway. It is exciting. The plot is predictable but I wanted a fun and lighthearted movie. I just wanted to be entertained and that was accomplished.
B004EJ14V2|1.0|I saw this movie on amazon instant and it cost me $4 and I wish I had my money back. I was a waste of both my time and money.
1401207529|5.0|There's really not much to add to all the excellent reviews by the other people here, but I'll put in my 2 cents.    I used to be the kid that, whenever I was at a book store with my parents, I hopped over to the comic book section and just read away, not caring about continuity, and not buying either. Flash forward years ahead into my 1st year of college, I happened to be at Barnes and Noble waiting for something (I forgot what it was). I went to the comic book section and there it was, Batman: Year one.    I was captivated from the start. I remember having to leave the store part way through the book, but all I could think about was how good it was. I eventually came back about 15 minutes later and continued reading it. The time came when I HAD to leave, but I still wasn't done! So I bought it! This became the turning point in my life where I started really getting into comic books and ordering trade paperback after trade paperback from amazon.    And to this day, I can honestly say that Batman: Year One is my favorite Batman story, and I've read a lot.
B001E75QH0|5.0|It brings all of the Indiana Jones movies even the least one which is great. If you are a fan of Indiana Jones like me than this a great gift for you or anyone who is a movie fan. Plus the packing is awesome.

B004SBX112|2.0|Update to my original review.... This will install with 3G etc even though you may get a message stating it won't. If you DO install that way, the ads will be there. If you install via Wi-Fi, they won't. If you have already installed it and have adds, go to the AppStore with your phone, choose settings, choose update tab and re-install.... that will fix it.    Ordered this but have ads??? Why? Anyone have any suggestions to fix this. Was going to uninstall then reinstall but cannot find a place to download again w/o paying again.

0743437497|4.0|I've read this novel four times now, and didn't notice until this time around a somewhat hilarious piece of inexplicable business that I'm going to leave to you to figure out. It has nothing to do with the supernatural and everything to do with the logic of everyday life, and I'm pretty sure King kept the scene as-is because he needed several things to happen plot-wise and couldn't figure out a way to have them happen otherwise. Think of it as an Easter Egg.<br /><br />The Shining was King's first foray into a ghost story at novel length, and its many strengths epitomize King's own strengths over the years, most especially the sympathetic characterization of his main characters and the verisimiltude of their reactions to supernatural phenomena. The basic set-up -- telepath (or 'sensitive') vs. haunted house -- comes directly from Shirley Jackson's classic horror novel The Haunting of Hill House, a novel King has his characters explicitly mention during the course of The Shining. Here, though, the telepathic character -- five-year-old Danny Torrance, gifted with the telepathic gifts similarly gifted hotel cook Dick Halloran calls 'The Shining' -- is able to contest the haunted house, and not be seduced by it as in Jackson's novel.<br /><br />The Overlook Hotel, way up in the Rockies and apparently next door to Hell, is a great character in its own right, a malign entity with no clear origin for its evil (in the movie, the hotel's malignity is attributed to that old chestnut, the Indian burial ground; here, as in other King works like \\"The Monkey\\" and Christine, there is no clear cause for the malice of this particular inanimate object: it just is, a productive evocation of Ramsey Campbell's dictum for good horror, \\"Explanation is the death of horror.\\"<br /><br />King conjures up a terrible sympathy for failed writer Jack Torrance, plagued by alcoholism and the memories of his physically abusive father, and eventually tested to destruction by the hotel, eroded into a killing machine aimed at his own wife Wendy and son Danny. Our more recent knowledge of King's struggles with substance abuse until the 1990's lends extra poignance to the novel, even as one also notes that Torrance, with his somewhat unpractical writing aims (he's a playwright and high-end short story writer) and literary pretensions (he dismisses Edgar Allan Poe as \\"The Great American Hack\\") is most certainly not a King-surrogate. But this novel is also about Danny's courage, and the growth of his mother Wendy into someone who can oppose both the horribly undone Jack and the hotel itself.<br /><br />The building of dread is this novel is skilfully accomplished, with some truly startling set-pieces of horror. King goes a bit over the top towards the end, though a lot of what happens can (as in Jackson's novel) be explained as malign hallucination rather than actual physical attack. In any event, this is one of King's novels that, warts and all, rewards multiple readings.t his own wife Wendy and son Danny.

1400052173|1.0|At the beginning I had expectations to learn about immortal cell line and interesting science facts behind it. As I was reading this book it became obvious that for every passage about science there was about a chapter about Henrietta's life and racial struggle of the past. Great biography but everything stretched out and was plain boring.
160788657X|3.0|This is just another of a long series.  OK, but not great.  The audio on the audiobook is distracting.  The female voice sounds like it came from a telephone with poor fidelity.  The backgroud sound is so different from the rest of the audio that it breaks the flow of the story.

B004J4WN0I|5.0|I was looking for something new to read and this title popped out at me.  After reading the summary I decided to take a chance and buy this book for my Kindle.  I am so glad I did!!  Great story, engaging cast of characters and Oberon is a fantastic character with lots of personality.  Atticus is a kick butt Druid, he reminds me of Harry Dresden (Dresden Files, Jim Butcher). Atticus has a cool attitude, and great lines.  I highly recommend picking up this book.  I'm about to go buy the second book.  Buy it - You won't regret it.

B004LWZWE2|4.0|I had this in VHS format years ago, but a friend never returned it - so I held out, as I knew a remastered version was comming out - that was 2 years ago. I have to admit, I love the way the movie looks and sounds. This movie is not sanctioned by AC/DC, as an outside filmer is responsible for it. It was done right after Highway to Hell, only a few months later Bon Scott would be dead. I think it was released right after that horrible occurance.      I gave it 4 out of 5 stars as I am disappointed about the packaging. I think it should have had more in it. The booklet is small, the pictures are small too and the guitar pick is a joke.     But the DVD - I love it, you know? That is where the 4 stars comes from. It is funny at times, this band is SO HONEST, the best Hard Rock band of all time - and I sincerly mean it !     There are new features on the DVD, guests, fans and contemporaries give an insight of the film, and AC/DC.      I do not regret getting this package mind you - I just think it could have been better - but get the DVD by itself then and save the $ 25.00.But get the movie, even the old version - it is a MUST for any Rock Fan !!      Really !

I'm sure you know that Battlestar Galactica is awesome; that's why you're looking to buy it, right?<br /><br />The Complete Series set that I received was perfect. Each of the four seasons (plus Razor) is set in its own casing, and each disk has its own mini case. Just how God intended complete series to be distributed. I couldn't be happier with it.

0199267170|4.0|Well edited and well brought out on high quality paper.<br />However, when you consider buying a complete Shakespeare, think whether you want one with explanatory footnotes or not. If you do, buy the Norton or Pelican edition. If you want the bare text, buy the Oxford or Arden, which have a brief lexicon in back.

B0050CQY1W|5.0|\\"4\\" is a more mature album but yet has enough songs that she can make videos and appear on 106 and Park with the kiddies to pacify them. The writing is superb and there is great production put in place.     \\"I AM...SASHA FIERCE\\" was not a good album to me; though I thought \\"Dangerously In Love\\" was awesome, and was a big fan of \\"B'Day\\" but again \\"I AM...SASHA FIERCE\\" only had about less than a albums worth of good music.     My faves on \\"4\\" are:     Miss You- ohhhh this song can just rock you to sleep its so smooth.    Best Thing I never had- It really makes me think about the frogs I had to deal with to get my prince, I have seen the video and it makes perfect sense.     Party- Andre 3000 and Beyonce' on the same song with good production from Mr. Kanye West (he's not an artist I like) but he is a more than decent producer. I mean even the people on Columbia had to know how special this song was; she submitted over 70 songs and they picked this and Andre 3000 is the ONLY featured artist on the entire album...    Rather Die Young- OMG ladies this woman LOVES her some Jay-Z! LOL! It's okay because you are supposed to love your husband; so I truly understand her words and feelings in this song.    Love on Top- This sounds like something a Young Michael would have sang with the Jackson 5; very upbeat but a really great song!    Countdown- Just listen there is nothing not to like about this song! NOTHING!    People just buy the album; you will NOT be disappointed! I love how people dismissed the whole album as a flop before it was even released because they didn't like ONE single! I personally didn't like it either; I thought it was too easy but this appears to be the bait for the younger people to buy the albums ie: Single Ladies for her previous album and the other meat and potatoes on the actual album. I think she has at least 6 or 7 singles on this album and I look forward to hearing each and every one!     I would personally love to hear the other 60 or so songs that she made for this album that did not get selected to be on the album; I am sure they are good as well!    Go B!

B00320L00O|5.0|I had never heard of Helene Hanff until several years ago when I chanced upon this little gem of a movie that has stayed with me ever since. I have watched this movie often since then, and find delight in it every single time. Also, I have read Helene Hanff's book of the same title, and it makes for a wonderful read indeed.<br /><br />84 Charing Cross Road is a love story of sorts - of two people brought together [though they live on separate continents] by their love of books, it is also a love of the old-fashioned way of correspondence, through letters, and a love of the written word. It also heavily alludes to a strong affection felt by the two leads for each other - Helene Hanff as portrayed by the wonderful Anne Bancroft [aka Mrs Robinson of The Graduate], and Frank Doel, the manager of the London bookstore, Marks & Co. at 84 Charing Cross Road [played by well-known thespian Sir Anthony Hopkins, a much younger Hopkins at that].<br /><br />The story focuses on these two characters who lead different lives on different continents - one in NY and the other in London, yet share a mutual love for books and the written word. Ms Hanff, a struggling writer finds it difficult to obtain obscure works of English literature in New York ['doesn't anyone read English Literature in New York?' she asks at a reputable bookstore] and decides to send out a plea for help to an English bookstore, Marks and Co.. Frank Doel, the manager of the store seems delighted by the request and obliges Ms Hanff with a few volumes as requested, and thus begins a wonderful friendship that lasts almost 20 years.<br /><br />What I loved about this movie was the contrast between the two leads - the New Yorker with an acerbic wit who is always very vocal, and the mild-mannered English gentleman. This is done with such finesse that you don't feel like its a cliche at all - thanks in large part to the wonderful 'chemistry' between the two leads, and their acting prowess.<br /><br />A story of true soulmates, brought together by a mutual love of books. This is a movie that will appeal to all bibliophiles and Anglophiles [and Ms Hanff is certainly both] as well as those who have a penchant for literary movies.ual love of books.

B001O54NL2|5.0|I remember when this album hit the stores. It was a sell out, and it was awhile before i got my copy. I've never seen this guy before, but i do remember hearing the Arthur Theme on the radio. And it was a smash for Christopher Cross , and he won a lot of Grammys for the album doing that time.  But i love this album , Mostly all the songs were hits. I bought this cd because i have it on vinyl and needed a cd copy because i truly love this album. I became a \\"CC\\" fan after this album....and it's a keeper.
B000784WMW|4.0|I've read \\"Jane Eyre,\\" and while I didn't enjoy the novel as well as a lot of people have, the gothic romance which takes place in its pages is simply one of the most memorable in English literature. I've seen countless reproductions of \\"Jane Eyre\\" on the screen and have always been somewhat disappointed in them: they either did not stay true to the story (granted, it is a long story!) or the character of Jane Eyre was overly pretty.     I really enjoyed this mini-series! This production stayed very true to the novel and managed to capture the overall feel of the author's words. Jane is very \\"plain\\" and demure, yet she has that quiet strength about her. She is calm and resourceful and as inviting as a calm meadow. She is not flashy, but she is some one you want spend a good deal of time with.    Mr. Rochester is way, way too good-looking in this version. However, that is easily overlooked by his gruff and rude demeanor, and the way he manages to treat everyone cruelly - even Adelle.     This production was filmed in the mid 1980's, and it does show. It is a video tape, so it has that quality of a soap opera, and not a modern movie. For me, personally, I like the aspect of sort of watching a stage production. I much more enjoy plays than movies, so I enjoyed that. Others might not.    Some reviews bring up the idea there was no \\"chemistry\\" between Jane and Rochester. I got that from the book as well. My belief is that in movies today, so much is put on the screen there is little left to the imagination. Jane was quiet and demure and reserved - that was her upbringing. And evidently, Mr. Rochester admired what he saw in that. To me, the relationship between Jane and Mr. Rochester worked in this production as, again, it mirrored the novel.

0345522478|4.0|This was an enjoyable read. Atticus is smart, sweet, sarcastic and sexy. I want his dog Oberon, who is a simple and loyal friend. In Hounded Atticus uses his wits and his charming personality to defeat a powerful enemy, proving that it's not always greater strength that prevails. I loved the fact that Atticus owned his own shop. I dream of owning my own store someday and I enjoy reading about characters who own their own small shops. I kept wishing that Hearne would tell us more about Third Eye Books and Herbs because I thought it was fascinating!<br />I was slightly disappointed with Hounded, but only because this book reminded me a lot of Jim Butcher's Dresden Files. That was a good thing and a bad thing. I love the Dresden Files, but when you read as much as I do you're always on the lookout for something different. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about a smart and sexy hero and loves being drawn into the lives of characters in a witty and well-written novel.<br /><br />If you like this book you may want to read:<br />Storm Front by Jim Butcher (Dresden Files book #01 - ISBN: 978-0451457813)<br />Hexed by Kevin Hearne (Iron Druid book #02 - ISBN: 978-0345522498)<br />[...]
140053271X|4.0|They cost about the same and use similar eInk technology. They are basically quite similar devices.<br />My primary use is going to be reading product manuals and datasheets that are as a matter of unwritten<br />rule in the PDF format. My secondary use would be reading ePub books, I have a large collection.<br /><br />The reason chose the Nook Touch over the Kindle were:<br /><br />+ support for open ePub format.<br />+ expandable storage with SD card slot<br />+ touch works better than Kindle's keyboard<br />+ I can root the Nook and install a proper browser<br /><br />Sure, there are minus points for Nook too:<br /><br />- Amazon has many many more bestsellers and newspapers last time I checked.<br />  This does not really matter to me.<br />- No option for 3G. I would have got a Nook Touch 3G were it available.<br />- No media player or audiobook support in the Nook Touch.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />1) After using the Nook for (almost) one one year, and probably 50,000 pages on the Nook, I am convinced that ebooks are the way forward. Ebooks reduce paper consumptions and save trees. Governments should subsidize ebooks if publishers don't bring down the prices. It is a shame that the price difference between a printed book and its Kindle copy is hardly USD 2. Is that the benefit of trying to save the planet?<br /><br />2) Those of you who read IEEE papers on their ebook readers may find the free program K2pdfopt from willus.com very useful.<br /><br />3) The only thing I miss on all the current generation ebook readers is the ability to take notes on the margins. I tried using the cell phone for that but came back to notepaper and pencils. Stylus support (like the Samsung Galaxy Note), handwriting recognition and voice recording should definitely be on the planning board.

030746363X|5.0|I've lost 30 pounds in the first 45 days after picking up this book and I loosely follow the diet but stick to the main items. Eating eggs, beans, veggies 30 min after waking up has been the biggest change in my lifestyle and it is for the better. I'm stronger and faster thanks to the kettle-bell routine and in two weeks abdominal muscles started to visually form from using the BOSU ball. I love the binge day as it works with my sweet tooth and is a good reward for me at the end of the week but I absolutely freaked out the first few times as my weight went up but the nice part was it was temporary and my waist-line shrunk which is way more important to me than how much I actually weigh.  After reading some of the sex tips I tested these on my wife with huge results and I agree that if you do certain things the way the book suggests you can end up with sore abs and a satisfied woman.

B004TTMYQG|5.0|This app has the best user interface of any calendar app out there.  In other words, it's the simplest to use.  Instead of a simple week view you can choose how many dates.  Also being able to instantly select which calendars to view using the favorite calendar buttons at the bottom is just genius.  The 4X1 Agenda widget has a really clean look showing the next three appointments with the option to open the weekly view or the monthly view based on whether you click on an appointment or the date icon.  Also, the weekly view is a little special in that you highlight the dates you want to see in the month view by sliding your finger over them.  So if you want to see from today until next Wednesday, highlight those dates and the \\"weekly\\" view will show all of those dates regardless of whether it is three days or 11.  The only complaint I have against this app is the lack of google tasks support.  Jorte, a free app, allows you to view your tasks on the date they're due on the calendar itself.  However, Jorte doesn't quite have the user interface of this app, so I use both together on my phone.  Great app and definitely worth $5 if you didn't grab it on the free app a day deal.  Droid X.

B00006RU5B|4.0|I bought this album from a Barnes & Noble store. One of my friends told me he listened to the album and was disappointed. I disagree. I listened to this album and found it to be very good. Chris Cornell, as always, hits those high notes like a speeding bullet. He is, in my opinion, one of the greatest singers in modern rock history.    And the rest of the band is Rage Against the Machine without Zack, basically. Tom Morello on guitar, Tim Commerford on bass, and Brad Wilk on drums.    I would say, the musical highlights on this album are Tom Morello's guitars and Chris Cornell's vocals. Tom Morello is always doing these effects on his guitar to make it sound unique. Listen to Rage Against the Machine's \\"Guerilla Radio.\\" Specifically, the guitar solo. Morello made it sound like a harmonica.    My favorite track on the \\"Audioslave\\" album is the third track \\"Gasoline.\\" Listen to Tom Morello's guitars. He's got an awesome-sounding echo thing on his guitar. I don't know what it's called cuz I was never good with the technical stuff. But I know how to describe the stuff.    The only thing I would object about the album is that the last half of the album is really dull and forgettable. But the first five or six tracks are some of the hardest-hitting rock songs I've ever heard.    Buy this album now.
0061784788|5.0|After slogging through The Mask Of Troy, by David Gibbins, this was such a breath of fresh air. It reminded me of why I love thrillers in the first place. Ever since I met James years ago, I've found him to be one of the guys I can count on to deliver the goods. He, like me, loved the old Doc Savage series and has taken that same spirit to the next level with a well plotted and well researched story that kept me entertained from start to finish.<br /><br />He spends a lot of time researching before he puts it all down on paper (or I should say, laptop) and he comes up with some highly imaginative storylines. I'm not usually a fan of a bibliography for a fictional story, but in this case, it really works and is a great supplement when you get to the end of the story. It is full of factual surprises.<br /><br />The usual cast of characters are back in the Sigma fold, including the mysterious Seichan. I'm glad he brought her back as I think she is cool to have around. My only beef this time is that some of the characters personal lives make the story a bit messy and give the impression that they may not be around for the next one. That drama distracted from the main story. I know it is supposed bring character depth to the story, but I don't think it really helped things. It wasn't enough of a detour to take away a star. Also, that whole intense scene with Gray and his crew didn't help Painter when it counted. Instead, it ended up being important in a roundabout way.<br /><br />The story had plenty of twists and left room for more. Unfortunately, I'm not sure who will still be around to carry the torch next time.<br /><br />As usual, the writing style was top notch. Very easy to read, the chapters and scenes were not overly long, the paragraphs were a breeze to get through and the dialogue well written. There was a bit if head hopping here and there, but I didn't find very many problems with editing and such. He has a great team of beta readers behind him.<br /><br />Yes, James is one of my all-time favorites and this book didn't disappoint. Highly recommended.s and this book didn't disappoint. Highly recommended.

B004A8ZX2S|1.0|The new Malick film - in production for several years, leaving Malick fans desparate for information for just as long - finally gets its release, six years after The New World. Allegedly working from a script that Malick first drew up a few decades ago (originally titled Q) it sounded very grand altogether, the most ambitious and explicitly existential of anything he's done so far. I think many waited in delight and confidence that Malick could pull off another cinematic masterpiece, maybe even his ultimate project. For a film maker who'd only made four features before this he had garnered a huge amount of critical and cult acclaim, not unwarranted. Days of Heaven is a cinematic masterstroke, a film so exquisite the plot is largely irrelevant. On the strength of his previous work I never feared that The Tree of Life could be a disaster. When it was subject to a hugely polarized reception at Cannes it was an indication that maybe not all was well; the films fans seemed to say nothing of import (either Malick sycophants or the waffly, pretentious bunch) and its detractors were fairly consistent in why they disliked it. That was a bad sign. The Tree of Life is a ridiculous splatter of simplistic and poorly executed drama. A painfully overreaching and shockingly unsatisfactory debacle.     It's such a shame. The film manages to feature some majestic images - some of the space imagery and much of the 1950s Americana environment - but in trying to tie them together the films often visual beauty gets subsumed with a boring, self indulgent flop-around in sentimentality. What is most surprising about the failure of this film is that the editing is incredibly amateurish. Even for the films topic it is far too long and repetitive, but also it cuts-to-black on so many shots, which has a very jarring effect. I can only assume this was a conscious decision (a planned editing style) but it is totally wrong. Why Malick didn't realise this and take the whole film and spend more timeediting it in a different way is beyond me. There is a bizarre amount of very brief scenes that seem to be just thrown in for the sake of it, as if the editor didn't want to spare them because they looked nice. The film's original score is unremarkable, but some of the other music featured is pleasant, like Henryk Gorecki's Symphony No. 3 II lento. The actors for the most part do a good job, except Pitt is fairly wooden and Penn probably shouldn't have bothered turning up, an unflattering gig for him. Chastain is lovely but has very little to do except look graceful and stay mute. The voice overs are stupid. McCracken is a good young actor and someone who probably has a decent future ahead of him. And the in-your-face Christian magniloquence? Uncomfortable to say the least.     Now this is saying a lot. The best part of the film is a brief line near the start. The mother is being consoled by an undoubtedly Irish neighbour over the loss of one of her three sons; the neighbour is confirming to the mother that life goes on and says \\"Sure ya still have the other two\\". I had a great laugh, unlike the other cinema attendees. That's all I got from The Tree of Life in the end. Malick aimed very high, obviously even too high for him. A monumental let down. But I don't fear for Malick's future; if he takes on more subtle projects he can recapture his magic. He may do that with his next film, he may not. Regardless The Tree of Life is a waste of time.
0439023491|5.0|Oftentimes, sequels to a bestselling book disappoint. This sequel to the \\"Hunger Games\\", however, the second in the trilogy, is just as good as the first, as it seamlessly picks up where the \\"Hunger Games\\" left off. The author is a born storyteller, and she weaves a story that, while simply written, is thematically complex.<br /><br />The author continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, who along with the other tribute from District 12, Peeta Mellark, has survived the \\"Hunger Games\\". While on a whirlwind, governmentally mandated victory tour, Katniss and Peeta see portents that all is not well in Panem politically and signs of unrest and dissatisfaction with the despotic rule of President Snow are becoming all too apparent.<br /><br />Suddenly, the stakes are raised, and the victorious tributes find themselves challenged in ways that they could never have anticipated. In fact, the author has come up with another ingenious plot that will keep the reader riveted. I could not put the book down, reading it in one sitting!  So, again I find myself, running down to the local brick and mortar bookstore to buy the third and last book, which I simply cannot wait to read!
B000H2N6GQ|5.0|I love this book, and looking back, I appreciate it even more as it was written before 9/11 and yet has the same \\"feel\\".  This, and Without Remorse, are my two favorite Clancy novels.  Okay, Red Storm Rising too.  This book has intelligent and realistic scenarios that keep the reader interested and excited cover to cover.  Definitely a keeper.
0439023521|5.0|My daughter recommended this book, telling me how she totally loved it and that it was part of a trilogy. I was a little skeptical at first, especially as it is touted as being for young adults, and I am anything but. Still, my daughter was so enthusiastic about the book, I decided to give it a chance.<br /><br />Well, I was totally blown way by this book. I could not stop turning the pages. What a great story! Though similar to \\"Running Man\\" by Stephen King in some ways, in that it involves a televised fight to the finish in a post-apocalyptic world, it is much more compelling.<br /><br />The author is a born storyteller, seamlessly telling the story of Katniss Everdeen, a sixteen year old girl living in the country Panem, in District 12, which used to be part of the United States of America. The people in District 12 are very poor, and they are ruled by those who live in a part of Panem called the Capitol.<br /><br />Every year there is a televised event called the Hunger Games, in which all children of a certain age group in each of the twelve districts of Panem are entered. Two, a boy and a girl from each district, are chosen to participate, and participate they must. The winner, and there can only be one, as it is a fight to the finish, is then supposedly set for life.<br /><br />This is definitely a plot driven story, and what a great plot it has, with many twists and turns! I was riveted from beginning to end. In fact, when I finished the book, I immediately ran to my local brick and mortar book store, just to be able to get the sequel immediately. I simply could not wait to continue with the story!

B0058VW36U|1.0|This is one of my all time favorite games on the I-Phone.....<br /><br />It is a great (and deviously difficult) game.<br /><br />Getting all the stars is where the real fun (and challenge) come into play.<br /><br />Sadly this version does NOT support multi-touch which turns a lot of the fun into a frustrating experience that relies as much on luck as anything else....<br /><br />The issues caused by the substandard controls are seriously compounded by the placement of the menu and retry buttons. On the IOS version (which does support multi-touch) its not really an issue because you are allowed to cut ropes and pop bubbles or pump the airbags simultaneously.<br /><br />If you never played the immensely superior multi-touch enabled IOS version you may enjoy this one.....<br /><br />But if you have the option to play the I-phone version you should.....<br /><br />Heck.....its worth buying a I-phone just to play this great game as it was meant to be played.<br /><br />1 star because its just isn't anywhere near as fun as  it should be without multi-touch.
B000A158TC|5.0|This is a Sony Playstation Portable (PSP) UMD (Universal Media Disk) copy of the Anime Classic Ghost in the Shell. Easily one of the greatest Anime and for that matter animated films of all time. This film was part of the movement that started Cyberpunk and in my view transcends mere animation and becomes art. If you want to view the beginning of the phenomenon that is Ghost in the Shell this is it.     Having a portable copy of this science fiction classic to watch anywhere is simple awesome and this is one of the first films I added to my growing collection of PSP UMD disks. I can't give a product for the PSP a higher recommendation. If you have a PSP and you love anime as I do then buy it! You won't be disappointed.

What a beautiful performer; Elvis is a lucky \\"SOB\\" and we all hope to have her with us for many more memorable performances. I'm a huge fan!

B0050CQY1W|4.0|Turning 30 at the time of her 4th regular longplayer, Beyonce's status as one of few superstars born and raised in the 2000's needed to be cemented with this 2011 album. The style of R&B had recently met with the identity crisis, including lack of good songwriting and few novelty ideas in arrangements. The singer was announcing in advance that the \\"4\\" will be a merger of genre and styles - however, this is not really the case. It's still a pop/r&b record and although some enrichments are present (and welcome), the record is not as risky as the 2006's bold B'Day (embraced more by critics than by fans).    On the positive side, \\"4\\" is not as uneven as the 2008's \\"I Am/Sasha Fierce\\" (embraced more by fans than by critics). For a bigger half of the record, Beyonce was able to infuse the songs - especially production-wise - with a sort of inner tension, lending the tracks the restless, positive energy that was here at \\"B\\"day\\", but mostly missing from \\"I Am/Sasha Fierce\\").    A good example of this approach is the sublimely understated  \\"Miss You\\", followed by the feisty, although rather conventional \\"Best Thing I Never Had\\". Kanye West/Andre 3000 collabo \\"Party\\" gets more fun to the mix, while the (lyrically) rather extremist \\"Rather Die Young\\" keeps the quality flag high, as well as \\"Start Over\\". The old-school vibe in \\"Love On Top\\" runs a bit counter against the whole thing, as it rather sucks out the record's momentum. This returns with \\"I Was Here\\" and the minimalist feminine-power closer \\"Run the World (Girls)\\".    Still, the \\"4\\" is mostly a satifying and cohesive listen, not the breakthrough masterpiece Beyonce would have liked, but a decent addition to her discography. It is a good statement of current chart-projected pop, with the impact on others than her fans slightly dubious (she cannot catch up with current popularity of Adele or GaGa). All this said, fans of r&b and pop should not be offended at all with \\"4\\". Although one cannot help the feeling that if a group of 60 songs was streamlined to 12 for this record, the results should have been more impressive.    (The deluxe version is bound to satisfy only Beyonce's most devoted fans, no song from the bonus CD would be terribly missed from the standard album.)
0316098329|1.0|I do not recommend this novel at all.  I bought this book because I saw the positive reviews on Amazon.  I have no idea why this book got positive reviews!  This is like the Jaycee Dugard story from the perspective of a child that uses broken English.  I did not enjoy the way the book was written.  The story was drawn out way too long with a description of how they lived in the shed in the backyard.  I was bored of reading what they did on a daily basis!  Bottom line - I regret having purchased this novel.  I only finished it because I paid for it.
B0052VUNHC|2.0|It's obvious that this is a self published book. I did enjoy reading it though, but I felt as if I was reading a book that seriously needed to be reorganized. If this book tried to find an agent, I know why it failed. As a writer myself, I found the characters and premise interesting and it did hook me. I was eager to read, but a part of it was to see what the heck was going to happen. I wasn't even half way through it and everything that should have happened in the length of a book happened in the  first six chapters basically. It should have been two books, one with Abby and Travis getting together, and then another with what happened afterward, vegas, etc. I also felt like travis' dialogue was very weak for what should be a strong and powerful character. Again, I really liked the book but its not polished to be published. It has several climaxes that threw me off because they weren't positioned properly. I also felt as if the characters were in HS not college. Nevertheless, the tension between Abby and travis was good. This book was good, not excellent or amazing, but it has a lot of potential. I'd read more of her books to see if they follow the same structure or if they follow proper format or writing.

B0001RVTXO|1.0|Buy them all.  Seriously.  Call me a fanboy but I'm saving you time here.  Just buy all the Pixies CDs and be done with it.  Buy this single CD and there are consequences, okay?  The obvious being you'll miss out on the rest of their music.  Why do that to yourself?  You're a nice person, you deserve better than that.  If you did buy this cheap single CD, how do you think people you admire, like and respect will think about you?  That's right, they'll know you're a jerk.  Really.  They'll see this in your collection and not say anything but the next day they'll talk to each other plus there'll be someone there you really like but haven't gotten round to asking out yet and they'll overhear when people are saying, can you believe it?  Only the Best Of?  What a jerk.  And the person you really like who overheard that conversation will be like woah, I'm not going there.  You'll miss out on not just great sex but possibly the love of your life.  Do you want that?  Honestly?  Christ, even your parents will give you one of those looks, and then just turn away without saying the obvious, which is you are such a jerk.  These people raised you!  You want to disappoint them like that?  After all they've done for you?  Good grief, they're at the end of their lives and you do something like this?  And don't say, oh no, I couldn't afford them all because we'll all know - that's right, everyone one on the internet will KNOW what a jerk you are because you can buy all the Pixies CDs second-hand and it's totally affordable even to a homeless person with a major addictive and psychiatric illness.  If a person like that, struggling on every level, can manage to own every Pixies album, what kind of low-life creep are you not to have made the effort to click a few damn buttons? You know what?  Why am I bothering with you?  Go ahead.  Buy the damn single CD and spend the rest of your life wondering what happiness could've been like.  Jerk.
0812550706|5.0|If you want an exciting read in a futuristic sci/fi book, I highly recommend Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card.  Just get 3 or 4 pages into it and the book will take you away.  The plot is full of surprises and twists.  I wonder how the author can write so convincingly about someone with superhuman intelligence, unless he himself possesses a similar level of intelligence.      In the world of the future, the Earth has nearly been destroyed by an alien race of \\"bugs\\".  All of mankind has had to put aside their differences and squabbles to fight the invader.  Earth's government knows it needs to breed a leader with intelligence to match the enemy's.  Ender Wiggin, may be that leader.  Follow him as the Earth's powers put him through test after test.

1594202710|5.0|A Review of Henry Kissinger's On China<br /><br />America is interested in China. Intellectuals have long criticized the citizenry of the United States for being self-absorbed and comparatively uninterested in world affairs. Many Americans have only given close attention to international events that directly impact them. In the case of China, it seems that Americans are deeply concerned not about what has occurred, but rather about what may come.<br /><br />Henry Kissinger's book On China is an excellent primer for any person who wants to know more about China.<br /><br />There is much here for the beginner, and also a number of items of personal interest for the scholar of modern Sino-American relations.<br /><br />Here are thirteen ideas from the book which sparked my thinking:<br /><br />1- Exeptionalism and Singularity<br /><br />Americans often talk about exceptionalism, the things that make the United States different from other nations. For the Chinese, the foundational concept is singularity. This may sound similar to exceptionalism, but it is almost the opposite.<br /><br />Where America sees its founding coming after long millennia of human history, benefiting from the experiences of historical civilizations and rising above all of them, the Chinese notion of singularity stems from the view that China has no founding--that it has existed longer than written history, that it maintained a long set of traditions from before recorded annals to the present, and that it is the only modern civilization to have done so.<br /><br />While many Americans claim universal principles of freedom that all nations should adopt, China claims universal principles of society that it has always used.<br /><br />2-Language<br /><br />The Chinese language is as old as written history.<br /><br />According to Kissinger, its characters were developed at about the time of ancient Egypt.<br /><br />While the Western nations have used and then moved beyond ancient Egyptian, Greek, Latin, and the numerous European languages, China kept and deepened its language.<br /><br />Only Hebrew, of all the Western languages (if Hebrew can even be considered Western), is as old, and its spoken form had to be resurrected in the twentieth century.<br /><br />While the culture of Western Civilization has used many languages, the Chinese Civilization has used basically one written language. Our Western classics, myths, and major political documents are mostly translations from a host of languages.<br /><br />Chinese classics are nearly all studied in the original.<br /><br />The result in China is a profound sense of continuity with the past and a closer connection to its traditions than experienced in any Western nation. It is hard for Westerners to even grasp the lasting significance of this reality.<br /><br />3-Dynastic History<br /><br />The Western political experience includes a long cycle of declining current powers eventually replaced by rising new powers--Egypt, Israel, Greece, Rome, Spain, France, Britain, and the United States, to mention a few.<br /><br />Each rises, leads the world for a time, then declines. A new power seems to arise every couple of centuries.<br /><br />In China, where history goes back past the time of the Egyptian dynasties, the cycle is different, and the differences drastically impact the way Chinese leaders view the world.<br /><br />The Chinese cycle includes a period of internal division and inner conflict, then an era of unity and dynastic rule, then another time of division and conflict.<br /><br />This cycle in China usually takes three to nine hundred years to run its course, and today's Chinese see themselves just sixty years into a new dynastic rule that will once again put China at the center of world power--for the next five hundred years or more.<br /><br />4-The Center of the World<br /><br />Until the nineteenth century, China never had to deal with a civilization or nation of \\"comparable size or sophistication....As late as 1820, it produced over 30 percent of world GDP--an amount exceeding of Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and the United States combined.\\"<br /><br />It has historically always considered itself the center of the world and felt deeply humiliated by its loss of dominance to Western powers in modern times.<br /><br />5-Secular Empire<br /><br />According to Kissinger, China has always been a secular empire.<br /><br />Unlike the West, religion, religious wars, and conflicts between major religious views have played little part in China's political history. Spirituality has historically centered on restoring the principles and ideals of a Confucian-style past \\"Chinese Golden Age.\\"<br /><br />Learning was seen as the key to this objective, and also to personal advancement. The goal of Confucian-Chinese spirituality, learning, and politics has usually been \\"rectification, not progress.\\"<br /><br />The main principle in this order was to \\"know thy place.\\"<br /><br />The pinnacle of society was the Emperor, who was both a political leader and a spiritual-religious symbol. He was considered \\"the Emperor of Humanity\\" on earth and \\"Son of Heaven\\" as man's \\"intermediary between Heaven, Earth and humanity.\\"<br /><br />This tradition of the great Emperor above all mankind, his bureaucracy to maintain order in all things, and each person fulfilling his proper place in society created a certain kind of culture that has lasted for a very, very long time through various outward governmental structures and forms.<br /><br />Most Americans disagree with the basics of this model, but we must not discount the power of its history and tradition.<br /><br />Kissinger wrote:<br /><br />  \\"If the Emperor strayed from the path of virtue, All Under Heaven would fall into chaos. Even natural catastrophes might signify that disharmony had beset the universe. The existing dynasty would be seen to have lost the `Mandate of Heaven' by which it possessed the right to govern: rebellions would break out, and a new dynasty would [eventually arise to] restore the Great Harmony of the universe.\\"<br /><br />Government was supreme.<br /><br />6-Monarchy and Aristocracy<br /><br />Where the West was dominated by aristocrats in nearly all countries, with a host of peasants and occasionally powerful kings, China was run by an Emperor and his army of bureaucrats (mandarins).<br /><br />The provinces (cantons) were likewise ruled by the mandarins, and the outlying (non-Chinese) nations were considered tributaries to the central Emperor.<br /><br />Kissinger doesn't mention that these are the two great types of historical governments:<br /><br />*  Monarchy ruling through bureaucratic management<br />*  Aristocracy ruling through class dominance.The American founding created a third system:<br />*  The Federal Democratic Republic ruled by constitutionally separated branches and levels of government all limited by checks, balances and periodic elections.<br /><br />7-Sino-centric World History<br /><br />Many modern Chinese see the history of the world as three distinct eras:<br /><br />*  China's world prominence until the nineteenth century<br />*  A \\"century of humiliation\\" from the early 1800s until the communist revolution in the 1940s<br />*  A rebirth of China's proper world role beginning in the 1940s and still developing today<br /><br />8-China's Grand Strategy<br /><br />China's grand strategy has traditionally revolved around playing foreign powers against each other.<br /><br />During the modern era, Britain, Russia, France, the United States, Japan, the Soviet Union, Korea, Vietnam and India have all been impacted by the Chinese strategy of \\"using barbarians against barbarians.\\"<br /><br />Through it all, China has held mainly to its traditions rather than joining the West (or attempting to join it) like most nations have done.<br /><br />For example, while most Westerners might agree that with three superpowers during the Cold War an alliance oftwo would be the strongest position, China followed its traditional non-Western approach by keeping the U.S. and USSR strongly pitted against--and focused on--each other rather than China.<br /><br />9-The Communist Era<br /><br />The pain of the communist era in China is felt by nearly every family and person in China. All suffered. Communism united China under central control, leading to increased power. But the pain of totalitarian communist rule created a modern generation hungry for freedom and economic opportunity.<br /><br />This era also changed the Chinese psyche from \\"fit your place in the system\\" to one of regaining China's place in world prosperity, power and leadership.<br /><br />10-Leadership through Symbolism<br /><br />Chinese leadership often operates with an emphasis on making impressions rather than literality.<br /><br />This tactic includes attempting to make things seem a certain way as a means of influence--regardless of whether or not the reality actually resembles the perception.<br /><br />In short, symbol is often more highly prized and utilized than the literal reality in Chinese culture and diplomacy.<br /><br />Western leaders and citizens who don't understand that most Chinese leaders assume the symbolic over the literal frequently misunderstand Chinese motivations, actions and words.<br /><br />11-Contemporary Chinese Literature<br /><br />Two current Chinese-written bestsellers (in China) include China is Unhappy: The Great Era, the Grand Goal, and Our Internal Anxieties and External Challenges by Song Xiaojun (2009) and China Dream: Great Power Thinking and Strategic Posture in the Post-American Era by Liu Mingfu (2010).<br /><br />Kissinger comments:<br /><br />  \\"Both books are deeply nationalistic. Both start from the assumption that the West is much weaker than previously thought, but that `some foreigners have not yet woken up; they have truly not understood that a power shift is taking place in Sino-Western relations.' In this view it is thus up to China to shake off its self doubt and passivity, abandon gradualism, and recover its historic sense of mission by means of a `grand goal.'\\"<br /><br />Liu advocates a Chinese return to a `martial spirit' and a military rise along with its economic rise.<br /><br />Liu wrote:<br /><br />  \\"If China in the 21st century cannot become world number one, cannot become the top power, then inevitably it will become a straggler that is cast aside.\\"<br /><br />Kissinger writes that these books:<br /><br />  \\"...could not have been published or become a national cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre had the elites prohibited publication. Was this one ministry's way of influencing policy?\\"<br /><br />He notes that official government views differ from the tone of these books, but doubts that this debate is over in China.<br /><br />12-War on the Economic Front<br /><br />Still, Kissinger says:<br /><br />  \\"A country facing such large domestic tasks is not going to throw itself easily, much less automatically, into strategic confrontation or a quest for world domination....The crucial competition between the United States and China is more likely to be economic than military.\\"<br /><br />After the Great Recession, this may be exactly what has so many Americans deeply concerned.<br /><br />As for the rise of China, Kissinger wisely suggests that America has the ability to substantially determine its own future regardless of what China does.<br /><br />We should worry less about China than about how to overcome our own nation's challenges.<br /><br />Peace and cooperation between these two cultures and nations is, as Kissinger puts it, \\"inherently complex.\\" It is important to the future of both nations that our citizens and leaders approach relations wisely and in principled fashion.<br /><br />13-A War of Ideals<br /><br />Kissinger suggests:<br /><br />  \\"The United States bears the responsibility to retain its competitiveness and its world role. It should do this for its own traditional convictions, rather than as a contest with China. Building competitiveness is largely an American project, which we should not ask China to solve for us.\\"<br /><br />I agree. Our biggest problem is Washington, not Beijing, and if we as the American citizenry handle Washington correctly, China will never be the threat it could become if Washington is insolvent or weak.<br /><br />As I said above, Kissinger goes into depth on a number of additional topics, all of which are valuable to the American citizenry.<br /><br />These thoughts are just a few of the many covered in On China.<br /><br />As a group, we don't know enough about China. Kissinger's analysis is astute and timely, based on both research and long personal experience. This is an important book, and it is a valuable addition to the prudent citizen's reading list on China.wer. But the pain of totalitarian communist rule created a modern generation hungry for freedom and economic opportunity.    This era also changed the Chinese psyche from \\"fit your place in the system\\" to one of regaining China's place in world prosperity, power and leadership.    10-Leadership through Symbolism    Chinese leadership often operates with an emphasis on making impressions rather than literality.    This tactic includes attempting to make things seem a certain way as a means of influence--regardless of whether or not the reality actually resembles the perception.    In short, symbol is often more highly prized and utilized than the literal reality in Chinese culture and diplomacy.    Western leaders and citizens who don't understand that most Chinese leaders assume the symbolic over the literal frequently misunderstand Chinese motivations, actions and words.    11-Contemporary Chinese Literature    Two current Chinese-written bestsellers (in China) include China is Unhappy: The Great Era, the Grand Goal, and Our Internal Anxieties and External Challenges by Song Xiaojun (2009) and China Dream: Great Power Thinking and Strategic Posture in the Post-American Era by Liu Mingfu (2010).    Kissinger comments:        \\"Both books are deeply nationalistic.

Liu wrote:        \\"If China in the 21st century cannot become world number one, cannot become the top power, then inevitably it will become a straggler that is cast aside.\\"    Kissinger writes that these books:\\"...could not have been published or become a national cause célèbre had the elites prohibited publication. Was this one ministry's way of influencing policy?\\"    He notes that official government views differ from the tone of these books, but doubts that this debate is over in China.    12-War on the Economic Front    Still, Kissinger says:        \\"A country facing such large domestic tasks is not going to throw itself easily, much less automatically, into strategic confrontation or a quest for world domination....The crucial competition between the United States and China is more likely to be economic than military.\\"    After the Great Recession, this may be exactly what has so many Americans deeply concerned.    As for the rise of China, Kissinger wisely suggests that America has the ability to substantially determine its own future regardless of what China does.    We should worry less about China than about how to overcome our own nation's challenges.    Peace and cooperation between these two cultures and nations is, as Kissinger puts it, \\"inherently complex.\\" It is important to the future of both nations that our citizens and leaders approach relations wisely and in principled fashion.    13-A War of Ideals    Kissinger suggests:        \\"The United States bears the responsibility to retain its competitiveness and its world role.

B004HO6I4M|5.0|AWSOME MOVIE  BEST MOVIE EVER  RIO HAS EVERYTHING THAT AN ANIMATED MOVIE HAS TO BE  I CAN'T WAIT TO BUY THIS MOVIE IN BLU-RAY
B004G600A4|5.0|This movie is an entertaining and adventurous take on the Rapunzel story. Around our house, kids (boys and girls ranging from 3 to 13) and adults alike enjoy it.     Now I'll let you hear from my twelve year old sister, the most ardent fan:     \\"I LOVE this movie so much that I got the junior novelization book, a poster of Flynn and Rapunzel, the Wii game, a coloring book, and downloaded the album. ...And I'm wanting SO much more!!!!!\\"     (Think someone has a crush on Flynn/Eugene? ;-D )    Yep, Tangled is a hit!
B0055FR5PS|5.0|From a military standpoint, this movie is great.  The dialog was exactly what I expected.  I admit that it was kind of like Independence Day, but that's not exactly a bad thing.<br /><br />Camera is a little shaky at times, but it's fitting when it is.  The visual effects are good/decent or on par with movies of today.<br /><br />People who are complaining about the Dialog...what did you expect?  It's a pure action movie and they did great on at that.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I bought this for our exchange student for Christmas as she got hooked on the show when she was here.  Loves it
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I bought this for my cousin for her birthday after we watched my own copy and both got hooked.<br /><br />It shipped very quickly and was in excellent condition. The DVD itself has a few fun special features, though nothing astounding.<br /><br />This show is funny and heartwarming without being cliched or saccharine. It's incredibly intelligently written for a network show. I'm a college student and pretty much everyone I know in my generation who has seen it loves it.<br /><br />Basically, a white 30-something lawyer gets caught with a fake diploma and gets stuck in community college. There he joins a Spanish study group and gets stuck with a bunch of goobers. You'll recognize some actors from their other work, but everyone does an excellent job so there's no reason to judge the cast based on its most famous members.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Multiracial cast that isn't a bunch of stereotypes. After watching shows with all-white casts it was refreshing. The characters are of different races and come from different religious backgrounds, but it's handled in a way that isn't cliched or preachy or offensive.<br />- It's a genuinely funny show.<br />- If you're into self-aware or \\"meta\\" stuff, this is 100% up your alley.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The first few episodes start off somewhat slow. It takes the show a bit to find its footing and a couple of the characters (most notably Troy and Abed) change for the better after the first several episodes.<br />- It leaves you wanting so much more (is that really a con, though? haha)<br /><br />I haven't seen season two (yet!), but I recommend this DVD 100%.
142314189X|5.0|I remember my friend recommending me the first book in the series. At first, I was kind of lazy and I didn't want to read it since I wasn't a big fan of reading books. But, once I checked it out the library and started reading, I was really entertained and the book kept me going. I finished the book in about two weeks, reading from time to time and I was really hungry for more. I checked out the second book and read that book in about a week. After I returned the book, I decided to search online and buy the whole complete series. When the product arrived at my front door, I was really excited to open up the third book and continue reading. Over all, I read the rest of the books in less than a month. I really enjoyed this series and it turned me into a reader, now I am currently reading \\"The Lost Hero\\" by of course Rick Riordan, and am close to finishing it. I seriously recommend this series to any new or old reader, you will love the action, mystery, romance, and so much more! The product was in great condition when I received it, so I was quite happy to have it on my table. It's in a very clean condition and I could not be any happier.
B0052U59F4|5.0|Ana is a young woman in every sense of the word. She's graduating, is about to move to the big city, searching for a job and is about to meet the love of her life. Her first love. An enigmatic 27 y/o male Christrian Grey, with a troubled past and mind, who worked hard ensuring wealth, security and control but never allowed himself to love.<br />They meet and an intriguing journey begins.<br /><br />A lot of firsts shared between them, it is obvious this will be the real deal, but can Christian give up his need to controll? And is Ana willing to submit to his needs without 'losing' herself.<br /><br />Strangely, as a reader you feel almost an intruder; reading about their struggle of feelings, their heated conversations, passionate lovemaking, especially the scenes in the RRoP and witty emails of these two. You want to read more because it's so honest and captures your heart and you are drawn in, to never let go of these two.<br /><br />The sex is of course hot but I think it's mostly about restoration and love with a huge touch of humor and wit.<br />i.e. Ana's innergoddess and subconscience will make you giggle snort and seeing Christian on this freeing journey will make your heart warm and insides tingle.<br /><br />A must-read!
B003XE3G0Q|5.0|If you love Crocs but have a narrower foot you are going to love these. I usually buy the Mary Jane Crocs but I have not been able to find them. I decided to try these instead. I love the fact that the back strap in part of the shoe and doesn't move. They also seem to have better cushioning than the regular Crocs. I did get a blister on the inside of my foot where the strap is attached.

B0041KKYCY|4.0|I finally watched the re-make of I Spit on Your Grave...<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />*Sarah Butler was the only decent actor in this film. She shines during the second half of the film, which she is out for revenge. My personal favorite scene is after the rape when she is walking away. I don't know what it was about the walk, but her walk away was almost as emotional as the rape scene for me.<br />*The way she revenges the rapes would make Saw creators envious. Each individual man was murdered in the exact same way that they assaulted her... I would try to explain it more, but it would give away too many details about the juiciest part of the movie.<br />*There was a lot of emotion in this movie. You could see on the faces of the men that were raping her some sympathy... It almost made me feel like they were thinking, \\"I really don't want to do this, but since they are why not.\\" Maybe mixed emotions is what I should call it; one minute they have this slightly disturbed look on their faces, the next they are doing horrible, horrible things to her.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />*I felt like a lot of the actors in this movie over-acted in attempt to get noticed at how great their acting skills were... and maybe get more jobs. I don't know. And I have bad news for almost all of them; their acting was sub-par at best. It's like a bad B-movie where the actors give it their all and it becomes forced. In a way this isn't really bad, considering I enjoy B-movies because I get a kick out of it.<br />*Throughout the whole entire movie I found myself thinking the same thing every body thinks when a female in a horror movie does stupid things. \\"Why did she go out there alone?\\" Why did she keep going outside in the middle of the night to lock the shed? And of course, while running through the woods (without any pants on, which I didn't understand) she falls. I guess this is just me griping... I would say that I wish there would be one horror movie where the female wasn't as smart as a 5 year old, but Jennifer makes up for this when she murders her attackers.<br /><br />The Ugly:<br /><br />*The rape scene was a little more shocking than I would have expected for a newer release. Most, especially compared to the movies in the 70's and 80's, are not as gruesome as the originals. Towards the end I did have to shield my eyes, because I actually put myself in her shoes. They treat her like an animal, literally.<br /><br />All in all this movie was interesting. I got it used so I saved a few bucks, which makes me not regret purchasing it.smart as a 5 year old, but Jennifer makes up for this when she murders her attackers.<br /><br />The Ugly:<br /><br />*The rape scene was a little more shocking than I would have expected for a newer release.

0525425578|4.0|This was good read, as usual by Grisham.  It was different in the respect it was  written from the view point of a young boy.
B001B1UO6W|5.0|I was very young when I first watched Child's Play... most would say far too young to be watching it. But times have changed, and in my day my father didn't know about the possible psychological effects a killer doll might have on a child.. (HAHA) I came across the 20th Birthday Edition when browsing through Amazon when looking to add to my collection of horror movies... What a gem to find, especially at this price!<br /><br />Child's Play was just as scary as I remember, and still got my heart racing. Not to mention this amazing find; this set offers many bonus features. I would highly recommend for those who remember watching it in the past, or are looking for a classic horror movie.
B00454U1O2|1.0|I've made two attempts so far to purchase this CD.  The first time was in a store and the warning label was covered up by the price tag, so I bought it thinking it was a \\"clean\\" version.  I was sadly mistaken, but the store kindly accepted it back even though it had been opened.  I then attempted to buy a clean version via amazon.  Unfortunately, though it was technically \\"clean\\", the songs sound ridiculous because there are big pauses where the foul language is deleted.  I wish that I could find a copy of the songs that are played by the radio stations.  Those seem to have alternative lyrics rather than awkward pauses.

0316067938|2.0|THE BREAKING DAWN BOOK WAS INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTING TO ME.  THE FIRST THREE BOOKS WERE FANTASTIC.  THE LOVE STORY BETWEEN EDWARD AND BELLA AND THEN THE TRIANGLE CREATED BY JACOB WAS RIVETING.  I ATE UP EVERY WORD.  THEN CAME THE LAST BOOK, BREAKING DAWN.   IT FELT AS THOUGH IT WAS WRITTEN BY SOMEONE ELSE. I ACTUALLY ENJOYED THE BIT IN JACOB'S VIEWPOINT.  BUT THE BOOK WAS ANTI-CLIMATIC AND THE SWEET TENDERNESS OF NEW LOVE THAT WAS THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THE FIRST THREE BOOKS WAS WATERED DOWN TO NOTHING.  PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND STOP AT ECLIPSE IF YOU HAVE NOT READ BREAKING DAWN.
B001EKP5FK|3.0|I ordered this three-pack of Barbra Streistand movies thinking it was a good deal.  I could not remove the subtitles from \\"The Way We Were\\" and the Spanish subtitles from \\"The Mirror Has Two Faces.\\"  I tried and tried and it was annoying to watch these films with subtitles - English and Spanish.
B0019N8P2W|4.0|The case the DVDs came in was cracked.  It arrived in only a bubble envelope with no other cushion wrapped around it.  Other than that the product arrived promptly and was watchable.
B000NIWI9K|5.0|The main attraction of this performance of Cosi fan tutte is not so much the vocal performance as the theatrical performance.  The interpretation of the music is fairly conventional and likely to please most people, but I would have preferred singers with a bit more vocal heft to really make the music shine.  However, the singers pull off very emotionally-convincing portrayals of their characters, and so the overall experience is very satisfactory.  Though this is not perhaps my ideal Cosi staging, this DVD is definitely worth buying.  If you are not yet familiar with this opera, this is probably one of the best productions to view, as the staging is never pretentious, nor does it interfere with the emotional impact of the music, and the sound quality is quite good, making it probably the most approachable interpretation of this work available on DVD so far.
1442419814|5.0|I couldn't put this one done. Read it in two days when it usually takes me a month to get through a book.
B003UV8TFE|3.0|This is a well-written book to whet your appetite for physics, if you know nothing at all about physics yet have a burning desire to learn about X-ray astronomy. I would think that narrows the audience a bit.    Physics was my favorite subject in college, and I have continued to read books for the layperson (Hawking, Greene, Kaku, etc.). Those authors have a way of explaining new leading developments in modern physics in a way that speaks to the non-scientist. Lewin has a way of explaining basic, established Newtonian physics that is easy to understand but won't appeal to many of us who have had a college course or two in general physics, or even a really good high school physics course. The best audience might be high school students who are about to take their first physics course.    This first part of the book takes on a conversational tone, talking down a bit, taking pains to reach us on our own level, almost like Mister Rogers if he had taught physics. (\\"See how revealing good measurements can be?\\")    The first two-thirds of the book covers a range of interesting topics, although I think that one of the author's favorite topics is himself and his wonderful teaching style. He has received countless accolades for his classroom presentation, and cares about teaching a lot more than many physics professors who phone in their lectures while focused on research, so he deserves credit. But he really wants us to know that he is able to get his students to roar with laughter, or shriek in delight--\\"The students' eyes widen....As you may imagine, it's really very dramatic and my students are always quite shocked.\\"    The oddest thing about this book is the bulk of it talks about fundamental physics, but then he launches into a long section on his own research into X-ray astronomy, his various misadventures in launching and tracking observational balloons, and his important discoveries. This second section takes on a completely different tone, with more advanced subjectmatter, and seems aimed a different audience than the first part.    This is a very accessible book for general audiences but depending on your interests and background you will probably just skim over one half or the other.

B004132HZS|5.0|Loved this series: the concept, the execution, everything. I've already pre-ordered Season Two and it's not even coming out in Britain until September.<br /><br />This is a series that is true to Arthur Conan Doyle's Holmes, not like some reimaginings (ie, books) where things just don't fit.<br /><br />My least favorite episode was The Blind Banker. It was a little slow, but I enjoyed it nevertheless. The other two episodes were brilliant and I have watched them multiple times.<br /><br />Benedict Cumberbatch is a perfect, perfect Holmes. To me, or at least in this role, completely asexual, self-absorbed, deadpan and autocratic.
0756405890|5.0|In the interest of being brief, my opinion of this book (and the sequel for that matter) is summed up in the title. If you are a fan of fantasy books at all (or any sort of adventure book), I recommend this book highly. The characters (especially the main character) all display a wide range of emotions, with virtually no reactions that are \\"uncalled for\\" (compare to Harry Potter where he lashes out at the only people trying to help him in every book for no apparent reason.)    The magic is intriguing and self-consistent. The descriptions are detained enough to have a vivid picture without being convoluted enough that you stop reading for boredom.     One of the best parts is the humor. While not every chapter will have you laughing, there are a good number of times where I found it extremely hard to hold in my laughter.     (A word of warning though, the second book, about 3/5 of the way through, is probably not good for younger audiences.)

B003UYV08E|3.0|As mentioned by some of the other reviewers one's ability to even finish a movie is a clear indicator of how well it is working for the viewer; this movie was balancing on the edge of rejection but managed to hold on well enough to get me to finish it. About mid-point I was almost ready to stop the movie when I decided to give it a little more time to develop. I'm happy to report that it got better in the second half and became easier to finish.<br /><br />As with any relatively new DVD, the quality of both the video and audio is very good; the problem is the story and the character were limping along at a marginal pace. It was difficult to relate to any of the characters and one became disinterested in what happened to them, especially in the first half; after that the action improves and the story becomes more interesting.<br /><br />I definitely recommend watching this movie before you buy it, it may work better for you than it did for me but I'll probably not watch it again. There was a trailer which suggested a sequel; the jury is out on that one.
1603090002|4.0|This is another good installment in a series that never quite lives up to its promise.  At least there is less of Moore attempting to write prose \\"in the style of...\\"  What I like about the league is the sheer intensity of the references - surely a mocking joke on post-modernism and the pastiche as well as a celebration of them.  The series on this level does not write down to its audience and Moore cleverly blends high and low cultural elements.  These books are for well read readers and don't pander to popular taste however the story Moore builds out of his splendid box of tricks could have sprung from any pulp writer of the last two hundred years and I know this is part one and some development into a more interesting plot is evident  but the fact is part 2 set in 1969 will involve pages of new characters and new references leaving Mina and Alan's development almost non-existent.  That said it is good fun and I love the addition of Carnacki and Raffles (a particular favourite of mine).
1594744769|5.0|This book was magical for me, along the lines of Alice in Wonderland meets Harry Potter. I feel that this book also will become a wonderful classic. Many kudos to this author and I can't wait to see what he has in store for us next!
0071762345|5.0|Dave Kerpen's \\"Likeable Social Media\\" is the kind of book you might start reading again once you've reached the end; I for one did. The author's effortless prose, ease of storytelling, and expert personal insights help make this a quick and enjoyable read as much as a must-have manual and reference guide for anyone involved in business and social media. The beauty of the author's lessons are their universal applicability; they are as relevant and pertinent to interactions among friends, spouses and family as they are to conversations between businesses and their consumers. In other words, even if you're not a tweep, a blogger, or a Chief Marketing Officer, this book will still come in handy.    Before meeting Dave Kerpen and reading his book, I thought I knew how best to leverage social media and interact with potential fans and customers. I was wrong. Truth be told, the fan base for my company has more than tripled in the 6 weeks since I finished reading the book. And to illustrate the power of WOM Marketing, I've told everyone I know (more than 1,500 people) to buy and read this book (if I haven't bought them a copy yet myself). If you're smart and savvy, you'll go do the same!
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|This new album they have made together in amazing. I have seen them live over 20 times between the 2 of them. Derek Trucks Band, Susan Tedeschi and Soul Stew Revival, along with the Allman Brothers of coarse. So I knew this CD would deliver everything I expected. This new band has some of our favorites that we have seen along the way with them, and some new additions that make this whole ensemble a CD that you can't pass up. Don't miss them live when they come to your area, you won't be disappointed!
B004RPRM46|5.0|Great audio to listen to especially while driving, which is where it works for me. Much practical and helpful advice which can also be challenging. What is life without some challenge and overcoming some of it?!
B00004CXT5|1.0|Apparently, \\"this disc cannot be played in your region\\". I can't believe Amazon allows stuff like this to happen. Yes, I noticed the SMALL red warning, not nearly noticeable enough. I am really upset that after waiting and specifically choosing a seller one state away from me to get it sooner, this DVD won't play. Why would a DVD seller from the states make DVDs formatted for South Africa? Amazon should look into a better way of warning it's buyers before purchase of regions. I wasn't aware that they even existed. Now I have an open DVD that the seller probably won't even take back because the seal has been broken. I always shop through Amazon, but am seriously doubting them after this inconvenience.
B0058P7KUA|3.0|Gameplay consists of what you would expect out of a dual stick shooter. You run Barry around, shoot everything that moves, and do everything you can to survive. halfbrick mixes things up a bit by changing the way health is handled in the game, as instead of a single hit resulting in death, Age of Zombies plays more like a modern first person shooter. As you take damage, the edges of the screen get red. If you're able to blast yourself a clearing and get away from whatever is chomping on you, your health regenerates and you're back to slaughtering everything in your path. I actually like this quite a bit because you only die when you're completely overwhelmed instead of biting the dust when you make a stupid mistake (which i do often). The controls are not ideal for small touch screen phones but you get use to them. The story mode is filled with swearing, toilet humor, and time traveling. In all, Barry will visit five different areas starting with battling prehistoric cave men zombies all the way up to the terrible zombies of the future. Each setting plays similarly, but it's nice to mix things up. Bosses also appear in game, but they don't really have any unique properties to them and instead just seem to serve as massive bullet sponges before finally falling over. The reward for playing through the single player is a survival mode for each time period, complete with online leaderboards using OpenFeint. Age of Zombies is not the best shooting for Android it just an okay game that i got tired of pretty fast. If you can't get enough of shooters, you'll love it.
B0017SXHR2|1.0|I was looking forward to a clean enhanced digital copy of my favorite Hitchcock movie. I have 20 year old VHS copies with a better picture than this DVD. As far as I can tell the only thing enhanced, is that they zoomed in on the movie to fill a wide screen. In doing so, the picture is pixalized/fuzzy, and the audio is poor. I do not suggest  you buy this DVD.  Dave
1569242739|5.0|It's a book about cupcakes! What isn't to like? My family and I have enjoyed every cupcake we have made for the last 4 years; chocolate, vanilla, gluten free chocolate, gingerbread(!!), chai, boston creme, and all the different frostings that go with.    As a note to future vegan bakers, it is very easy to overmix vegan baked goods. Mixing by hand is all that is needed, stand mixers and hand mixers are overkill on batter recipes. It took us a couple of batches of vanilla cupcakes to work it out, and the results were well worth the effort!

0061714372|3.0|I ordered this book for my brother.  It arrived in only a day or two in the mail after I ordered it, and was in the condition as advertised.  When it comes to books, and finding relative bargains compared to bookstore new hardback prices, Amazon is hard to beat.  Thanks, Amazon!
B004VRK3ZU|4.0|Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />I was disappointed in the video quality.  It just wasn't that good.  I kept thinking that it wasn't much better than the DVD.  I only give it an 8.0 on a 10.0 scale, with 10 being the best.  Aspect ratio was 1.85:1, so there were no black bars on the top and bottom.  I wish it would have been 2.40:1.<br /><br />The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack was pretty good, great in parts.<br /><br />This is a good movie, that I have always enjoyed watching.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Nothing spectacular or overwhelming, just the Foo's getting back to hard rock at it's best. For a fan it's difficult to evaluate, but I like the direction they took!
B000UX6OHK|2.0|it is really delicate. i had the watch for two days and i noticed this huge scratch across the face of the watch, and i dont do anything rough like banging into things. its just really sensitive.  overall, it looks really nice, but for the price i paid, i would have liked more durability.   also, to adjust the wrist size is not so simple. its not just taking out links by yourself. i had to take it in to a place to get it adjusted to my size, and that was another 10 bucks.

B002EEP3NO|1.0|This was my most disappointing Amazon purchase ever! Bought it for a nice discount on Amazon Warehouse Deals, and like many of the Lego deals available the box was re-sealed due to damage. But unlike many of the other sets we enjoyed, we were terribly shocked to find out that ALL THE MINIFIGURES HAD BEEN STOLEN! Henceforth, if we ever buy discounted Lego sets from Amazon, we'll try to open them up soon enough to check for missing parts while we can still get a refund!
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This is absolutely wonderful!  The cast that performed did a very good job, particularly Jean V.  It was great when the 2 London casts and the original cast performed together.
B005529BDK|4.0|I tried this on my Viewsonic gtab with stock rom and it worked good. Okay graphics and sounds. This really isn't my type of game, but decided to try it out. People who like this type of game should download it.
B005529BDK|4.0|The controls are set up such that they interfere with gameplay. You need to tap the screen to shoot, but tapping the screen also flips the pieces! Also, a storyline would greatly enhance the game.  Good puzzle game overall though!
0142429112|2.0|The idea is cute, but the story is too long and filled with plenty of unnecessary details. I liked both Diana and Matthew, but they never fully come to life for me. The ending is abrupt though the story was dragging itself for about 20 hours... But it looks like it's the first book in the series. I doubt I will listen to the following books, though I wish the heroes the best on their journey and the quest for the right to love freely.<br /><br />Victoria Evangelina
1936719118|5.0|Seven bucks and two hours is all it takes to consume Derek Sivers's book 'Anything You Want.' That's time and money well spent if it changes your life--and it very well may.    'Anything You Want,' and The Domino Project that it is a part of, points out that just because many business act in one way it does not mean that yours has to. And just because many people act one way, it does not mean you have to.    Sivers's stories are short, easy to understand, and make their point well. Some of the stories have been on his blog for a while, but are actually easier to consume in book form. Like that story? Here's another. Like that one? Here's another. An hour later and you're smarter and astounded at what just happened.    The second part is tougher: Use what you have learned to break out of your box (or perhaps `poke the box' would be the better term), give the book to someone, talk about it, do what you want--anything you want--but do something.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|A friend of mine introduced me to the game and we cannot stop playing.  The great thing about this game is that it is different each and every time.  The game board is never the same so your strategy will change from one game to another.  This is a game that doesn't get boring.  Would definitely recommend.

0345308239|2.0|Tuchman is a talented story teller and fluent writer.  She plays the role of the public intellectual who takes an intelligent and well-educated, if nonspecialist, audience for granted.  As I understand it, her essential argument is that \\"folly\\" occurs when (1) a country follows a path that is demonstrably counter to its self interest at the time and (2) a feasible alternative path is available.  She argues that, defined in this way, folly is a persistent part of human history and sets out to demonstrate this with a Trojan War \\"prototype\\" and examples from the Protestant Reformation, American Revolution, and Vietnam War.  For my money, her presentation of these demonstrations fails to frame her hypothesis in an orderly enough way to test it.<br /><br />My principal problem is that she takes a very old fashioned view that individuals in power commit folly if they act in ways that do not promote their country's interests.  In effect, she argues that \\"good\\" men--and it is almost always men in her examples--have a moral obligation to favor the interests of their countries over their self interests.  She then demonstrates over and over how men have acted in their own self interests, as they perceived it at the time, and in so doing directed their countries down undesirable pathways.  She suggests that, even if an action will hurt a man who takes it, the man commits folly if he does not see his morale obligation and act for the greater good.<br /><br />Does a truly \\"feasible alternative path\\" exist when individuals must deny their self interest to ensure that a country follows that path?  I am trained as an economist, so perhaps it is not surprising that such a path does not appear feasible to me, especially when many \\"good men\\" must deny their self interests for the alternative path to prevail.  What she calls \\"folly\\" looks to me like the unavoidable consequences of the very complex games that people play in their every day lives, at all levels in a country.  Saying thatwe cannot avoid \\"folly\\" without heroes leaves me wondering what useful, operational meaning \\"folly\\" really has.  Plans that only heroes can execute are rarely viewed as realistic or useful, except in the most desperate times.<br /><br />My economic training tells me that another way to approach her demonstrations would have been to explore how, in each case, a country might have aligned the interests of those she asks to do the right thing with their countries' interests.  If she could show how that might have been done, in the prevailing cultural milieu of each of her demonstrations, two benefits would arise.  First, she would verify in a constructive way that the alternative paths she presents are as plausible as they are \\"feasible.\\"  Second, and more important to me, she would give us specific suggestions on how to avoid, in our own life times and day-to-day decisions, the \\"folly\\" that she has observed in the past.  Because she never explains how an alternative path could have been realized by normal human beings, I am left asking how it is helpful to call something \\"folly\\" if we could not have avoided it.<br /><br />I have a second concern.  In each demonstration, she meticulously documents that intelligent, well-informed people knew at the time that the policy that a country was pursuing was not consistent with its self interest.  Again, her approach feels terribly old fashioned.  Well-intentioned, well-informed people can disagree and often do.  After the fact, it is easy to choose the people whose position is borne out by history and say they knew the truth at the time.  Well-intentioned Englishmen were convinced that losing the 13 colonies that would become the United States would seriously damage the British Empire.  They turned out to be wrong.  Serious, intelligent patriots in the U.S. who had seen Communism spread from the USSR to China in 1949 were convinced that the domino effect was real enough to demand U.S. action to stop it.  They turned out to bewrong.  But in each case that she examines, no one had an obvious monopoly on the truth in the heat of the moment.  Her treatment of the domino effect is especially egregious in this respect.  Page after page, she simply assumes that the intelligent, well-educated audience she takes for granted *knows* that the domino effect was balderdash and that people like them would have known that in the 1950s and 1960s.  She apparently feels no need to explain how they would have known that, because she never does so.<br /><br />I am tempted to think that she is speaking inside the old clubhouse of the the well-to-do Northeasterners who once thought they had the moral obligation and the right to lead the nation and to do so in the right direction as they saw it.  That is not the world that we live in today or that anyone lived in during the periods that she describes.<br /><br />So, she tells engaging stories about each of the four cases she examines in depth.  These stories may be worth reading for their own sakes.  But her story telling does not provide solid analysis.  She fails to link the four cases in convincing ways.  And so, she fails to make her broader case that each offers a distant mirror of our own time *and* that these cases can help us learn from history and avoid the folly of the past.  I wish the world were so tractable.
B001FHNWXY|3.0|It's the first word that comes to mind. This book is a great quick read and has plenty of twists and turns. It is EXTREMELY sexual, so do not let kids read this book, and almost pornographic at times, but it has some fantastic one-liners and quotes. It follows Victor Mancini a recovering sex addict and his struggles. Victor PURPOSELY chokes in upscale restaurants for two reasons: 1. He wants people to save him. He wants people to feel like saviors, heroes...because he can't. 2. He needs the money. The people feel like saving him are a part of their lives forever. They can't forget the man they saved. So because of their pride they send him money and cards and check up on him. That's only part of the strange but exciting plot. Trust me, there's big surprises hidden in this book. I love Palahniuk so this isn't one of his extraordinary works but nonetheless a DAMN GOOD BOOK. So some guidelines: If sexual content offends you DO NOT READ THIS BOOK, if death puts you off NEIGH, and if you like bright HAPPY TIME books DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.<br />Okay any survivors? Good. You'll like this book, maybe even love it.
0385732554|3.0|I have to admit, I was a bit disappointed by this book. I understand that it is intended for a much younger reader than myself. Still, it seemed incredibly simplistic to me. For one thing, Lowry does not give many details about how the society has come to be, or how it really functions. Despite that I thought it was a great thought-provoker for younger/more reluctant readers, and provided some truly chilling scenes. One more quibble: the ending was open-ended and unsatisfactory. I know, I know, it's supposed to make the reader think. But, argh.    [...]
0307454541|5.0|I have heard all of the hype about this book, and found myself a bit skeptical when I picked it up.  Forty years ago Harriet Vagner disappeared on a \\"closed\\" island during a family reunion.  Despite the limited number of suspects, the mystery has never been solved.  Reaching the end of his life, Vagner is desperate to uncover what happened to his niece.  Blomkvist, a recently disgraced journalist, his hired to write an autobiography of Vagner and secretly try to unravel the mystery of Harriet's disappearance.  Reluctantly, Blomkvist begins delving into the massive number of documents and information that has been collected about Harriet.  Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo, is a genius computer hacker, yet lacks basic social skills.  Hired by Blomkvist, the pair continue to unravel the mystery and find out more than anyone bargained for.<br /><br />Well-paced, the book slowly unravels the mystery while keeping the reader wanting more.  A beautiful balance between suspense and revelation is maintained throughout the entire book.  I really enjoyed reading The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and am eagerly waiting for its sequel to arrive in my mailbox.  Overall, I highly enjoyed this book, and would highly recommend it to others.
B0040ZA2D6|4.0|I surprised my 9 yr old son with the CD after watching him sing along to the songs while watching Big Time Rush on TV. He loves the songs! He added them to his MP3 player and listens to the CD at bedtime.<br /><br />As a parent I am not a big fan of the TV show, its a little ridiculous (in my opinion) - but my sons loves it and the songs aren't that bad. There is nothing negative in the songs, so I feel comfortable having him listening to them.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|Maybe you've never seen or read \\"Memento\\"--It's not required to get the gist of this review.  \\"Memento\\" is about memory loss and so is \\"Before I go to Sleep\\". I bought the book because of the possibilities of the subject matter.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan  and his brother who brought the concept of short term memory loss to the page and screen. \\"Memento's\\" protagonist must record memories within minutes via tattoos and Polaroids because his memories are lost to him every ten minutes.  In this novel, Christine also suffers from memory loss and records her memories daily in a journal to preserve her memories knowing she will awake the next day as a blank page.  The concept of memory loss is provocative and full of conceptual possibilities.  \\"Memento\\" delivered on the possibilities 100 Percent.  This book, not so much.<br /><br />I bought this book because the subject matter has so many fascinating ways of being played out.  It could have been extremely engrossing but instead was  very repetitive, slow and oddly emotionionless.  The characters were never fully flushed out.  I felt almost nothing for anyone in the book, including Christine.  The ending was somewhat satisfying but only marginally.<br /><br />This was the author's first novel so I give him big snaps for his first effort.  It is easy to criticize but hard as hell to actually deliver.<br /><br />I would give this author a second chance.
B005529BDK|4.0|The game seems like any regular shooter, but the flipping adds another dimension. I didn't expect it to keep my interest so quickly and so long. Definite must have.
0553381407|5.0|The discussions of different types of abuse and manipulation are masterful: clear, witty, with many helpful, real examples from the author's practice as a therapist.  One often hears that abuse is abuse and that the effects of psychological/verbal abuse are the same as the effects of physical abuse, but it sounds like a lot of self-indulgent nonsense (everyone's a victim).  Until you read this book, which really shows--instead of just tells--the truth that abuse is abuse, period, and that all forms of abuse have a lot in common and can be understood.  Meaning that your parents aren't just \\"difficult\\": don't just write their toxic behavior off  like everybody does with George's parents on \\"Seinfeld.\\"  No, something concrete and comprehensible is going on and this book will truly help you figure out what it is.  More important, the book will help you see it's effects on you and your family.  I would give the \\"diagnostic\\" parts of this book six stars.    That said, I do think that the author is a bit too hopeful about toxic parents themselves and the benefits of confrontation, having it out.  Truly difficult parents are usually set in their ways: their toxic behaviors have become reflexes and if my and my friends' experiences are any guide, just cannot be rewired.  As important, most toxic parents seem to thrive on confrontation itself, on the drama, on role-switching from victim to savior to judge and back again.   Of course, the author gets this.  She presents having the will to engage in a serious, calm confrontation as a revolutionary step, the best way to claim your own life and perspective, finally to cut the umbillical cord--whether the confrontation changes your parents' behavior or not.   But I'm not so sure, it seems like just another battle in a war of wills.  The thing is not to fight, to let the drama go.
B0058P7KUA|1.0|I really tried to give this a chance before leaving a negative review.  now that I've had some time with this to TRY to play I feel it's fair to write this.  concept seems like a great game, but that's where the good ends.    now on to the major problem.... this game is apparently so poorly written that it doesn't work and constantly f/c.   I tried everything from rebooting phone to uninstalling the apk and reinstalling to get this one to work.  for the entire time I've had this on my phone if gotten the app to work.... twice.    There's no reason this shouldn't work for my phone.  I run the HTC Thunderbolt rooted running CM7 mod.  this is a flagship device and runs EVERYTHING that you throw at it.  Please don't blame ME for writing a negative review because an app is broken and does not run.    Since this is back to  bing a paid app now I would highly advise against buying this one.  Look at all the other reviews out there talking about the same problem.  Save your money and spend it on something that actually works.

193659451X|5.0|Although I am an English major and have always loved reading, I confess that when I picked up Persuasion, it was the first Jane Austen book I had ever actually read. Watching the films had made me love the stories, but I had never truly experienced the original text. This is the only one I have read so far, and so declaring it my favorite seems a stretch. However I can say with confidence that at this moment, I can't think of another book I've read this year that I liked half so well.      The characters in the book have personalities that range from immature to mature, logical to illogical, playful to disdainful, and shallow to deeply heartfelt. Jane Austen has a true talent of capturing real people, in moments of weakness, in strength, and just about everything in between. Anne's sister Mary is one who feels that the world is never quite kind enough to her, while her father feels a lack of need to be terribly kind to the world. Lady Russell, a friend and mentor of the heroine Anne, is logical and sensitive to family connection so much so that occasionally she cannot see the inherent flaws in those whom she is trying to reconnect. The main character, Anne, is a complex creature through whose eyes it is fascinating to watch the world. She is sweet and humble, yet occasionally sarcastic and unfailingly realistic.     Another aspect of the book is the implicit value of integrity. Anne does not do anything which she feels to be untrue or unworthy, and she stands up for what she believes in despite the disapproval of her worldly father. One example of this is when she decides to visit an old school mate who has been both widowed and crippled instead of going with her father and sister to visit Lady Dalrymple, a distant cousin of the family who hold a title of nobility. Consistently throughout the book, there is a deep and unwavering determination to do the right thing.   Jane Austen is able to capture the complex relationships between people and the intricacies of humannature in beautiful and captivating language, and her skill of tone allow the reader to be completely transported and involved in the world she writes from. I look forward to reading the rest of the books as soon as I can, for through fiction she seems to speak poignantly about my life in a way I couldn't. Sometimes she goes against the adage of \\"Show don't tell,\\" by summarizing conversations and describing peoples attributes without allowing the reader to see them in action. However, this is a matter of style, and no great downfall for the book itself.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I could not put this book down!  I was captivated by the nature of the story, the characters and the drama.  I loved every minute of the book.  This book is a winner for those who enjoy suspense, romance, drama, and life-altering experiences.
B0051BVQFG|2.0|In a word, this movie is ANOTHER cgi driven, alien invasion, battle flick. Nothing new to see here, move along. While I like the main character, he was not quite what I envision is a marine sergeant killing the baddies, especially when the baddies are outta this world. So, the movie bogged down in places, upon which I promptly fell asleep. Further, some of the one liners were so cliche they were almost offensive. If you want an alien invasion flick, ID still does nicely. This movie doesn't get close to ID's standard.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|Just as important as how John sold over a million books in five months is the info on what did NOT work.  This is worth the price of the book alone!  I cannot tell you how much money I've wasted in the past advertising my businesses and all the other stuff I bought into because \\"that's the way it is done.\\"  John Locke probably saved me thousands of bucks not putting into action some of the plans I had to help my book sales along.  While even he admits he got lucky with his blog about the coach, I do see the value in blogging.  Thanks John for taking the time to share the info and your stories.  I'm a fan.

1594202842|5.0|I loved this book. It reminded me of me and my sister, who follow the 'model first child, rebellious second' pattern Chua so cleverly outlines.     Being half Asian, I was also raised with half the strictness and structure that Chua's daughters were raised with. I too took piano lessons, practicing sometimes up to five hours a day, with my father insisting on Chopin or Beethoven. I wasn't even allowed to listen to the Beatles when I was a little kid. I didn't know they even existed. I actually learned 'Hey Jude' on the piano before I even knew who the Beatles were. I ended up in med school at 19, of my own accord, not anyone else's, so I guess I turned out alright. My sister is a lot like Lulu, gave up piano for painting--something she loved, and won many awards for--also of her own accord.     I know a lot of people are angry about this book, probably because the Wall Street Journal provocatively titled their article on this book \\"Why Chinese Mothers Are Superior.\\" That is NOT what this book is about; this is a memoir and it is not telling people how to raise their children.  Any advice is given in a sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek manner and is not meant to seriously offend anyone.      This book is really about two parents from totally different backgrounds, both trying to do what's best for their kids, even though their views are radically different.  Ultimately, they come to an understanding and acceptance of their children's individuality.  It is an entertaining read for a summer weekend.

0920668364|5.0|This book touched my heart the first time I read it.  It makes me cry now when I try to read it outloud because my girls are grown and I miss having them with me.  It's a story telling children that no matter what, Momma will always love you and you will always be her baby.
B0034G4ORC|4.0|I don't have much to add that the title doesn't say.  I thought it was great as a gritty war movie.  The acting was good, action was great, effects were good, suspense/drama very good.  I wish I would have caught it in the theater, would have been cool to see on the big screen.<br /><br />Ryan Hoover, author of Immortal Implements
B005529BDK|5.0|If you like Bejewelled or Tetris, you'll enjoy this. A blend of Bejewelled, Tetris, Bubbles and others, but unique in itself. Good graphics, well implemented, challenging, and a variety of ways to play it. Works great on the Xoom. I got it as Amazon's freebie of the day, but it's worth paying for.
B001AP11L6|5.0|I told my husband, what I like about the White Stripes is the storytelling.  He replied, \\"Oh sure, 'Seven Nation Army' [the white stripes most popular radio hit] involves lots of storytelling.\\"  But I beg to differ (and delineate my point a little).  It's not just storytelling, it's storytelling with a twist.  Jack lets you know that the person speaking is a screw loose in album the opener, Seven Nation Army; mental instability is at the forefront of one who says, \\"I'm talking to myself again because I can't forget...Back and forth through my mind behind a cigarette.\\"    Perhaps there is a more precise word than storytelling.  For in the bits of stories told, the perspectives are never straight, they are always corkscrewed through the mind of the one who is telling it, so that you can't exactly trust what's told because of who's telling.  Each song stays true to its perspective, not stepping outside the speaker's thoughts to say, \\"Wait, I am really quite off,\\" but he allows you to figure it out what's wrong all by yourself.    And why should the speaker be allowed to have a self-aware moment?  No one who's crazy realizes it, even as they rail, their voice cracks, and they break down in their own self-trumpeting song.    Although my husband refuses to listen to the music for the pure sound of it (in the same way someone refuses to try a bite of something that has once made them nauseous), to me its sparse arrangement and disharmonious sound is a further artistic reflection of the storyteller's mind.  A guitar in the hands of the storyteller becomes an instrument of psychosis, the notes playing like a discordant brainchild.  It can be jolting, yes, but then there are also moments when the speaker tries to to lull you, although it's always made known, through little phrases here and there and a cracking in his voice, something's a little bit off.    Around the time I first bought White Elephant, I read a book called \\"Why Does He Do That?:Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men\\" by Lundy Bancroft.  Several of the songs on the album describe this kind of control.  The song (the title within quote) \\"You've gotta keep her in your pocket, where there's no way out,\\" is gently sung as if to lull the listener, and is about confusing control with love.  The other tracks step into the first-person narrative, telling of self-centered expectations, from obnoxious egomania in \\"Ball and Biscuit,\\" to humorously pathetic in \\"I wanna be the boy to warm your mother's heart.\\"  There the whining singer is completely blind to his own faults, nonetheless clings to high expectations: \\"I'm inclined to go and finish high-school, just to make your mom notice that I'm around.\\"    Even if the sound isn't initially ear-appealing (though many are thrilled by this sort of music), I have found its quirky storytelling worthy of many listens.

B0001E5TSS|1.0|I was extremely disappointed. Amazon sent me a DVD that is supposed to be used in another country. It would not even work in my DVD player so I don't know if the movie was any good or not. They made a big mistake at my expense.
B0009P66TK|5.0|I am a fan of special watches, looking for pieces that that not everybody has;  As such I own a Vostock Rocket N1 GMT , a Junkers JU 52 cockpit GMT , and owned a Panerai Luminor GMT (44) that was stolen  I also own a Victorinox Swiss Army GMT and a Timex Expedition which can show 3 different timezones, although analog  You have now guessed that I am a dual time zone fan.   I was looking to replace the stolen Panerai but since I have the mentioned GMT pieces, was looking for something different and was aiming at the Luminor Destro ; the price however killed my interest and surfing the web I came across the U Boat watches and loved the Flightdeck model, noting that several movies starts, including Stallone ( a Panerai fan ) and Schwarzenegger wear them; the price again was an issue and suddenly I came across this watch which had features I was looking for, big, rugged style,with a robust leather strap with stitches ,for leftahanders , in addition with a chronograph , which none of the above mentioned collection has; and the price via Amazon was unvelievable ( USD 189 against MSRP 4995 !! ). I oredered it immediantely amd am enjoying wearing and using it; I am not a lefthander and waer it on my left wrist; it looks great and allows easy manipulation of the crown and the chronograph buttons  The only features that can be questioned are the luminiscence ( you have to plkace it in front of a strong light in order to glow in the dark for a short while, and that the chronograph is not \\" rattrapante type\\", where you can time 2 events ate the same time  But with the look, the features and the price, the mentioned issues become peanuts   The watch looks great, so far works great and has increased my collection of non expensive nice watches with special features

B00005214X|5.0|I recently purchased this and listened to it for the first time. Aside from Phil Spector's crowded &#34;wall of sound&#34; production, I was astonished. The songs are every bit as good as those put out by the Lennon/McCartney team that everyone loved so much during the Beatles' heyday. The production unfortunately dates the recording and takes away from the gorgeous melodies and arrangements that make up these songs. It's a travesty that these were leftovers from when George was in the Beatles. Lennon/McCartney and George Martin were probably not into the whole spiritual vibe that George put into these songs and therefore blocked him from including them in Beatles' albums.<br /><br />I think that George had come well into his own eons before he was given credit. If you listen carefully you can hear some of the detail that he put into the other two's compositions from listening to these songs. The cord changes, simple, direct and beautiful melodies are all here. He has often been credited with being the creator of the &#34;Beatles Sound&#34; as their musical director. His lyrics are a little too simple sometimes, but that's what he was about. About living your life simply and uncluttered. The message in this is so much deeper than the pseudo-mysticism that he put into WITHIN YOU WITHOUT you or his other Beatles songs dealing with spirituality. I just love this album. George was truly an old soul with a heart of gold. He could've fleshed out the remainder of the underdeveloped &#34;White Album&#34; if some of these wonderful gems were added. All of the songs are highlights and most of them range from excellent to outright classics. It's only fitting that he enjoyed the amount of success that he did with this album. John and Paul should've been ashamed to take advantage of George's passive, loving personality to deny him the recognition that he deserved while still in the Beatles.at he deserved while still in the Beatles.

B002ZG975Q|3.0|After having read the book by Alex Flinn, I must say, I had high expectations for this movie. I rented it, and I was sadly mistaken- the movie took out soo many important parts from the book and I was disappointed, to say the least. The part of the mirror was not in the movie at all, the online chats with Kyle's friends who were like him (mer-man, frog man, etc) was not in the movie at all either, and this was an important part because it helped Kyle deal with his \\"transformation\\" better than he could have alone, without any moral support. The part with his ex-girlfriend was not in the movie, when she came over to his house and was scared of him because of what he looked like.<br /><br />The book made Kyle seem that he was a beast- it stated that he was growing hair on his back & arms, and in actuality, he stayed the exact SAME as he was before, only with a disfigured face because of the witch's curse.<br /><br />I would say this movie is mediocre at best- but definately disappointed that the movie wasn't like the book AT ALL.

0061714372|5.0|I was there, (kid in the 80's) & heard all the rumors and picked this book up to check out Daves side of the story.Very detailed about the Metallica breakup and goes beyond..to his emotions & feelings. Everything from hair to hightops it was a great read & nostalgic to anyone in the 80s thrash scene.   The kids of today, who love heavy metal, will like this book.    Ive seen Megadeth around 10 times thru the 80s & Mustaine was nothing but a ball of anger. This book tells why. He tells where hes failed & admits to his faults & how hes made amends. Some if it must of been hard to him to write about... the disgusting things he did in his addictions.   The end was something I did not expect. He was nothing but a walking dead man who hurt alot of people.When Dave came to a fork in the road of life, he blazed his own trail through the middle, breaking all the rules to continue doing what he loves. His strength & hard core spirit,to keep writing & playing, is MOST inspiring.  His decision to write this book, to reach out to others like him, was a great idea.   Im just like him, and it helped me to stay on the path Im going.  The only disappointment in the book was it ended where it did.  I hope he writes a sequel because what he is doing now must be VERY hard & in all rights, most would quit.   I know he is reading these reviews, so, WRITE A SEQUEL DAVE!!!  Some of us ARE LISTENING!!

B003Y5HWGI|3.0|Update: ABC has cancelled this show, announcing it in August 2011. My review, posted before the announcement follows.<br /><br />I watched this show this season.  I liked it the least of the seven seasons. This show used to have great writing but now the dialogue and plot developments are straight out of afternoon soap operas. Also, the characters who are being emphasized are ones who are now driving me crazy.  And boy, does Teri Hatcher, as Susan lead that pack!  I just wince every time she comes onscreen.  I find her goody two shoes act really tiresome at this point.  Ditto her marriage with Mike. (I used to like him but now I can't stand him either because of her.)<br /><br />I could have done without Vanessa Williams.  If she is supposed to be the new Edie, that didn't pan out.  She's playing a very similar role to the one she played on UGLY BETTY.  Just like Susan, she too is super tiresome. She is a woman used to living in New York who is now living in the burbs and it just doesn't make any sense that she is.<br /><br />The other three are better overall. They are pretty much the characters they have always been. Bree is dating a man much too young for her.  Gabby finds out she has a daughter who is being raised by a lower class Mexican family. Felicity Huffman's Tom becomes a raging success and she can't stand it.  Although this wasn't groundbreaking material, it was at least more like the other six seasons.<br /><br />In an act of pure desperation, Paul Young is returned to the show.  He wants revenge on everyone on the street for being instrumental in sending him to prison. His feud also continues with his arch enemy, who is still in prison.  This is the woman whose sister he killed for being instrumental in his wife's suicide.<br /><br />And on and on we go. I think we are close to the end of the road here and that Wisteria Lane is due for some demolition work, like razing it to the ground, if the writers don't get some better material going with a focus on the remaining three housewives of interest.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B004VBAHG6|5.0|I can admit when I'm wrong. I dissed this CD in the comments of a negative review, essentially affirming the criticisms based on brief clips. I had said that Peter's voice is tired, that this music is bland, that it lacks the anthemic power of \\"Deep\\" (the favorite among Murphy fans).     Well, I couldn't resist Amazon's fantastic price and bought it anyway.    BOY, was I wrong. About everything.    Let me start over: Peters voice is not only NOT tired, it's really freaking STRONG. Listen to the refrains of \\"Prince and Old Lady Shade\\" and that raging, psychotic howl in \\"Uneven and Brittle.\\" This is Peter at his prime, not at his end.   The music is exceptional--Murphy rocks on this one. Guitars cut and claw through the songs, and the whole thing is beautifully produced--there's a depth of sound here. Play this one on good speakers.     I'm still not always sure what Peter's lyrics are about (what the heck is \\"Shick Shack\\" in \\"I Spit Roses\\"? The song describes Murphy's feelings about a schism that formed during the recording of Bauhaus' \\"Go Away White,\\" when he actually confronted his bandmates and, well, spit rose petals at (on?) them. The lyrics describing a mutiny and the ship he'd though had sunk are metaphors to Bauhaus' final demise). \\"Secret Silk Society\\" throws a bone to his goth fans with a gorgeous, creepy, sinister, stalking minor key melody and Murphy at his growling, dark best. Heck, I'll come right out and say it: \\"Ninth\\" is what the final Bauhaus album OUGHT to have sounded like. Normally, I favor the Love and Rockets side of things, but in this case I gotta give it to Peter--in any dispute about where the quartet's musical direction ought to have gone, \\"Ninth\\" closes the case.

B004EPYZP8|4.0|Matthew McC does a very good job as the lead, the best since he played the religious leader in CONTACT. He is a defense attorney, more likely to be defending Hell's Angels than the hoi polloi.  All that changes though when he gets the scion of a Los Angeles real estate family.  This good looking defendant is played by Ryan Phillipe who is fast becoming a pro at playing creeps. He does a good job but I hope he gets another kind of role soon.<br /><br />My problem with this film is with the women and specifically the mother of the defendant, played by Frances Fisher. Fisher does a fine job.  However, I read the book years ago and I seem to remember that the mother's role is a lot more complex than the way it is presented in the movie. In fact, the mother's role in the book is a doozy.  So I did not like losing that aspect.<br /><br />I'm not sure how many more of these ex wife type of roles Marisa Tomei can play.  I think she may be reaching the end of the line with these roles and needs to start looking at more mature parts.<br /><br />Essentially in this film we have a client, Phillipe, taking over the case by taking one step after another to back his attorney into a corner. Worse yet, the lawyer has a small daughter and has to worry about his client using his daughter's safety to control him.<br /><br />If I had to choose between reading the book and watching the movie, it would be no contest.  I'd pick the book.  However, if you have no intention of reading the book, the movie is well worth watching and Matthew McC does an excellent job as the lead.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00003CXA6|5.0|Gettysburg is one of three planned films arising out of the three book series by Jeff Shaara.  It was the first film made from the second book in the series and depicts the battle that is generally considered to be the real turning point in the Civil War.  For those who simply want action, comedy, or drama this will not satisfy.  The reason is because the film is an excellent portrayal of the real people and events.  Unlike so many other Civil War films, all the main characters in this film were real historical people.  All the events were real historical events.      God's and Generals was the second film made, arising out of the first book of the series by Shaara.  It too was excellent.    My only disappointment is that the I have heard the producers have decided to not move forward with the third and last film in the series.  That is a real shame.
0062060554|3.0|Before I Go To Sleep was interesting, but ultimately not as compelling as I was expecting.  The premise is fascinating.  How do you go about living your life when you have to start over building memories each day?  The sheer weight of that and the impact it would have on an individual's health and well being is enough to generate many stories, but when you add in the feeling that the people in your life are not being honest with you and you begin to doubt your own sanity, then you have all the makings for an intense psychological thriller.<br /><br />I never felt much for the characters in this novel, simply because it is hard to flesh out characters when the narrator doesn't know much about them either!  The pacing often felt excruciatingly slow. The author doles out clues at such a slow rate, that I initially thought that the things that weren't making sense were indicative of a plot problem.  It turned out that these were clues to solving the mystery.<br /><br />I think anyone who picks up this book will know that something is off right away.  I figured it out pretty soon, and ended up reading the last part of the novel just to make sure I was right.  I really did not feel compelled to get all the details by that time.<br /><br />The author is a fine writer, and I appreciated this glimpse into the nature of memory and the role it plays in forming who we are.  She provides some marked insight, and Christine's emotions always felt authentic. Ultimately, I think the story itself was just not as unique and thrilling as I was expecting.  I have been wavering between a three and four star rating, but I believe just ok best describes this effort.  An ok read to while away an afternoon, but it won't knock your socks off.
1595826971|5.0|If anyone want's to know what is inside this book, it is essentially a ton of ideas for the new game Alice Madness in art work form. What is excellent about this book is it is virtually stunning and visually Macabre yet has that somber beauty of classic art work shown in mesuams. Each photo has a few descriptions of ideas that were either too scary, or just would not fit at all, plus it also has BETA photos of the planning stages for American Mcgees Alice Madness that goes into detail of the jumping and platforming etc.     Overall i liked the book, i might be complaining about something small but the pages seems to be greased a tiny bit, like if i touch the page even after i have washed my hands with soap and dried them off it has a small bit which can leave residue but that is very small considering the pages are complete black it is hardly noticable at all. I would tell anybody that this is worth a buy due to the fact that now a days, we do not have that much oldschool games that come back and look better than ever, even in art work form.
015204907X|5.0|I love to read this book to my one year old. It introduces so many things: high and low, near and far, skinny and wide, colors, music, brave and scared, stars and moon, etc. A great way to teach and a fun story as you search for the green sheep throughout the story. Highly recommend this book!

B00008YJH5|5.0|I recently discovered the Pixies, first with Doolittle, then Surfer Rosa. As with Doolittle, I didn't fully love this album at first. After the first 10 or so listens, I began to get somewhat bored with it. But I kept listening, and my dedication paid off. It's so consistent, I can just pop in either album and 35 minutes later I'm filled with adrenaline.   I've listened to Doolittle about 60 times, and this about 30-40 times, and I plan on listening to it a lot more.     Favorite Tracks: Bone Machine, Break my Body, Broken Face, River Euphrates, Where is my Mind, Oh my Golly (Play this track LOUD! It's amazing)    [[ASIN:B000003TAR In Utero]]

B00127RAJY|4.0|I just finished my first workout of the DVD - I loved the length of the workout. I got my heart rate up to 183(max) with an average of 144.  The music was upbeat and fun, Jillian really stressed correct form to prevent injury, and pushed users in a very positive way.  My favorite part of this workout was how important form and injury prevention are to her - she does this by showing modified exercises, as well as the full blown move.  The only thing I did not like was the lack of stretching at the end of the workout. To get a good stretch you need at least 30 seconds per stretch; I feel she rushed through the stretches and did not stretch all of the target muscles we used. Other than that she was techincally correct and very motivating!  I would recommend this to anyone, just make sure you stretch a little more after the workout is over!
0385484518|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! Very inspirational and touching. I read it while going through a hard time and surprisingly it helped me out a lot. I would recommend this book 100%.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|The title Sucker Punch, as in didn't see it coming, makes sense. I expected nothing from this little movie except some eye candy and maybe some silly video game scenes- but it actually has a story which draws you in and makes you feel for the characters- if you let it. In between the CGI, eye candy, and the music is a little layered story of suffering and sacrifice, and (spoiler)....... in the end Babydoll doesn't get her wings of freedom but through her sacrifice perhaps earns a spot in a different 'paradise' (future angel?). You can make from this movie what you will, a lot, or a little which is part of its charm.<br /><br />As far as story telling goes this movie is great. It's paced well, has excellent music, and lots of good trippy visuals. It was a suprise to me. Instead of laughing at it I really enjoyed it. For its entertainment value alone I think Sucker Punch will likely end up a cult classic.<br /><br />The theatrical release is a must have on Blu Ray, especially if you have a home theatre, well worth the money.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|I've never chuckled so much at a simple little game like this. I would have paid three dollars for it, had I not gotten it for free.
0307477479|3.0|I'd heard such good things about this book and was really disappointed.  It's decently written, but none of the characters are at all sympathetic or even particularly interesting.  I wish I'd checked it out of the library and not purchased it.
B000002IOY|3.0|This album has literally been decaying in my collection for years.  It was pretty experimental for it's time period because previous to this album Overkill played a pretty straight forward brand of thrash.  However, in the year 1989 Overkill were quite cognoscente of the fact that thrash was evolving in more progressive/experimental and technical directions.  They decided to straddle the line between the evolution of the genre, and still tried to remain gridlocked to it's more dirty and gritty roots.  The formula for this album is 100% attitude and 35% quality, and what I mean is that the riffs don't really deliver, and they often sound like they are stolen and recycled from other thrash bands of the time period.  Perhaps the fact that this was the last album to feature Bobby Gustafson on guitars was the real issue.  The band has never quite recovered in that department since his departure but that is another story.  No, instead I would suggest that Gustafson was either bored of playing thrash by the time this rolled around, or that he he lacked the commitment or skills it would have taken to give this album a more lasting quality.  Bobby Blitz is the definition of thrash attitude, his vocals are raunchy and his lyrics border on the asinine.  He is the attitude of this band, and even though I found the majority of the lyrics on here laughable, I must concede that he displays all the necessary posturing to make himself a great thrash frontman.<br /><br />The album starts off quite weak with the \\"Time To Kill\\", a by the numbers thrash song that has no business being an opener.  \\"Elimination\\" features blatant rip offs of Metallica and a horrid chorus from Blitz.  \\"I Hate\\" is a laughable thrash \\"anthem\\", I suppose Blitz envisioned a pathetic sing along for the live shows with this one.  \\"Birth of Tension\\" is a speedy but tired and boring by the numbers thrash attack.  As for the standout tracks, \\"Playing With Spiders/Skullkrusher\\", is probably the best Overkill song of all time, which is ironic considering it has a doom laden atmosphere that crawls into your brain.

B003YBNRHU|5.0|Being a long-time fan of the Doobie Brothers I could not wait to get my hands and ears on their latest recording, World Gone Crazy. Whenever the band is near my home, I am in the audience. Whatever they record, I want to own it. The redo of \\"Nobody\\" that appeared on their website prior to the record release was a prelim of great things to come. I love that track. It is so typical Doobies, and nobody can recreate THAT sound (no pun intended). I bought the CD I put it in my car CD player (perhaps the best place to listen to any new CD) and was completely knocked out. There simply is not a bad cut on it, the collaborations are tasteful and not overdone, the singing is better than ever (Patrick Simmons' voice has not lost once ounce of sweetness and Tom--what can you say about Tom? He is the voice of the band isn't he? And he writes anthems!) Hook after hook is memorable. All the writing and playing is superb. And you know what, we saw them play 4 cuts live in April of this year and the live reproduction was flawless. My hat is off to you guys. It is simply, in this war baby's view who owns all your records, arguably the best thing you have ever done. You have not lost a step since the 70s. My suggestion to Doobie fans, both ardent and casual, run, don't walk to a store and get this CD. You will wear it out. The more you listen the better it gets. My only criticism--the fact that the record is not getting the play it deserves and may go unheard by so many. Oh what has happened to the radio market that showcases sheer talent? \\"WGCrazy\\" should be a million seller easy. And, as Tom often says, \\"that's a fact people\\".

0307716511|3.0|\\"Sister\\" is the debut novel from Rosamund Lupton, a screenwriter who lives in London with her husband and two sons.  The novel has been highly critically praised in the United Kingdom, and has achieved bestseller status there.<br /><br />New York resident Beatrice gets a call in the middle of Sunday lunch: her younger sister, Tess, an impulsive, penniless art student/waitress, has gone missing.  So Beatrice, English born and raised, boards the first flight home to London. But as she learns about the circumstances surrounding her sister's disappearance, she is flummoxed to discover how little she actually knows of her sister's current-day life--as, for instance, the fact that Tess was pregnant, and lost the child shortly before disappearing.  The police, Bee's fianc&eacute;, and even the girls' mother accept they have lost Tess but Beatrice will not; until Tess's body is found, an apparent suicide.  Once again, everyone else accepts the suicide hypothesis, but Bee will not.  She moves into her sister's damp, disorderly, pokey basement flat, and starts to investigate Tess's life in depth.  Needless to say, she gets more than she expected.<br /><br />Lupton is a good writer, and does an able job of giving us London in its several seasons.  Her narrative and descriptive writing are good, her dialog fine, and her plot satisfactorily complex.  I did, however, have some problems with the book.  Most importantly, I thought the character of Tess, the younger sister, to be quite clich&eacute;d.  I also found that the combination of Bee, the older sister, serving as both main actor in the story and narrator was somewhat claustrophobic: this feeling was only deepened by the fact that the author chose to tell her story in the form of letters from Bee to her deceased sister.  I just wish the author had let in more of the world.  The focus upon the relationship of the sisters was much too intense for this reader, and took the book too uncomfortably within the territory of chick lit.  But what can I say, I've only got a brother, and, yesterday, while he was staying here, we happily occupied ourselves by assembling a new office chair for my husband.  Guess this brother-sister pair has a completely different, much understated dynamic.  At any rate, SISTER made me rather uncomfortable.ve only got a brother, and, yesterday, while he was staying here, we happily occupied ourselves by assembling a new office chair for my husband.

B002ZG98FU|4.0|I did not remember seeing any movie by Rachel McAdams before, but she was great in this movie.  Both Diane Keaton and Harrison Ford are great actors, and I like them both.<br />At first the movie is little slow, but once the tiny network starts to compete on air to get their ratings up, it gets funnier.  I wondered if there are people like Mike (Harrison Ford's character) in real life.  Nobody would question the existence of petty rivalries in the work environment.<br />One more thing: I would not over analyze or take this movie too seriously.<br />This is a good comedy to watch with the whole family, hope you like it.

0937381888|4.0|How To Brew is a great book for beginners.  The detail in the book is very good and there are a good numbers of pictures and graphs to get each point across clearly.  I would definitely recommend this book for someone looking to start out in the wonderful world of home brewing.
B004J4WQ46|5.0|I listened to this album in my car the 1st time, loved just about every song.  The Strokes have such a unique sound, it has really grown on me - I was thrilled to see they had a new album out. This CD did not disappoint. They're the only band that can make the songs like that, they are really in a catagory of their own. I played it later for my husband, he didn't like it like I did at first -but now he does! The more you listen the more you love it! I always put 5 CDs on random & whenever one of the Strokes tunes from this album comes on he'll mention what a great song it is - this CD is loaded.  I definitely recommend.
1558216847|1.0|I agree with the objections of Mr. Dunn, who points out several flagrantly impossible feats presented as fact.  I, too, have spent a lifetime backpacking all over the world, and for a true outdoorsman it is impossible to suspsend disbelief sufficiently to take the author at his word.      Nevertheless, many of the anecdotes seem too vivid to have been completely fabricated.  Perhaps the author needlessly embellished an already amazing story to ensure a book deal?  Perhaps, for example, they received quite a bit more help & guidance than the author lets on?    It rather reminds me of \\"A Million Tiny Pieces.\\"  The author could have saved everyone a lot of trouble had he merely published it as autobiographical fiction rather than an autobiography.

Equal parts of hardship, injustice being masterfully balanced out by victory and redemption was simply brilliant.

B004Q7DQLS|1.0|When I first saw this book, and read that it was going to be about dragons - one of my favorite things to read about - I was excited and anxious to get my hands on it.  Then the awesome reviews started...just one or two here or there.<br /><br />Then the flood came.  Review after glowing review saying this was the best thing since the literary version of sliced bread.  Me, being well me, I became skeptical. I just couldn't believe that something that had NO (at the time) critical reviews pointing out anything that was wrong could possibly be true. I tend to avoid trends, fads, and anything that gets glowing praise unless it's from a good friend that knows my tastes. It wasn't until several people, whose opinions I usually agree with, gave it fantastic reviews that I decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />It started off fairly good, and I was excited again. Pia, a good girl caught in a bad situation, is running for her life. She made the mistake of trusting an ex-boyfriend and everything is now spiraling out of control.  Dragos, alive since the forming of the universe apparently, has a ton of power, money, influence...and is bored out of his mind. That is, until someone breaks into his very guarded horde and steals something from him.<br /><br />After that it started to go downhill. I think the biggest problem for me was the characters.  Pia and Dragos just never completely settled into character. Pia switched from being submissive, scared, unsure of her place to yelling out orders, smoothing things over, and generally becoming a 'queen.'<br /><br />For example - she's just been brought to Dragos' penthouse. She's not sure of her place there, is she a prisoner or a guest. She's naked in bed with Dragos, conflicted about how she feels in his arms. The \\"breakfast fairie\\" (no I'm not making that up) busts into the room to deliver their morning meal, sees them in bed (why isn't the bed in a separate room?) and Dragos FLIPS out about Pia being seen in bed in a less than ideal state. He's growling at the fairie who is stammering out apologies. Pia just takes over. Calms Dragos, apologizes for him to the faerie and asks her to knock before coming in next time.  Her FIRST morning there.<br /><br />Dragos went from very wooden thoughts, actions and dialogue - to slang, street-talk, and things I'd equate a teenager saying. In addition he was a bit too possessive, demanding and protective. Almost the entire 2nd half of the book takes place in Dragos' Cuelebre Tower....and the one time Pia decides to leave it, well of course she gets kidnapped.<br /><br />The mystery of what type of Wyr Pia was intrigued me for a little bit, until I realized that the first thing I guessed was the truth. Dragos apparently didn't know until she'd changed though. That doesn't do a lot to convince me of his superior intellect.<br /><br />Then there's the whole problem with the evil Dark Fae King. He's supposed to be smart, ahead of the game, and calculating - apparently evading Dragos for a very long time. Yet Pia manages to fool him, outright lie to him, escape from him (in a very unbelievable scenario) and get almost all the way home before he catches up.<br /><br />Lastly I'm going to address the dragons (and gryphons, thunderbirds, and harpies) that make up most of the shifters we've met to this point. There's nothing especially special about them. They're like every other shifter I've read - that's not a bad thing necessarily, but it doesn't make them special either.<br /><br />In the end, I think part of my grade is because of the insanely high expectations that all the glowing reviews set for me. If I had gone into this book with normal new-to-me-author expectations I may have thought it a good book.  As it was, it felt fairly average with little to make it stand out from the crowd.<br /><br />Though I probably will check out the sequel because Tricks was the one character that I thought was supremely interesting.eal state.

It is rare for a book to be so good that it affects me thus.<br /><br />Buy it. Read it. Love it. :)<br /><br />Alex

0316069353|3.0|In what is arguably the weakest book in a series that began with \\"The Lincoln lawyer\\" criminal defense attorney Michael Haller takes on the murder case of Lisa Trammel.<br /><br />Lisa Trammel was already a client for Haller's exploding business of stopping foreclosure. It is not work Haller likes but the criminal stuff was in short supply due to the bad economy. That same hideous economy created a huge foreclosure business caseload and that has kept things goings for his law practice. Abandoned by her husband and with a nine year old son, Lisa had come to him desperate to save her three bedroom house from being taken in foreclosure by Westland Financial. Lisa has not been the best client Haller could have wanted. Instead of quietly sitting back and letting Haller do the work in court, Lisa has become a publicity hound. She started a grass root internet campaign against those involved in the foreclosure crisis, led demonstrations outside the bank, and in general has refused to take direction from Haller while annoying him with constant questions involving the strategy of her case and other issues.  Among many of her targets is Mitchell Bondurant senior vice president at Westland Financial.<br /><br />In charge of the mortgage loan mess at Westland Financial, his name is on all of Haller's court paperwork. As far as Haller knew, Lisa Trammel did not know Bondurant and was obeying the restraining order the bank had gotten by staying away from their property. Now the man is dead in a parking garage and Trammel has been arrested for murder. As in earlier books in the series, Haller continues to preach his philosophy that in his role as defense attorney he does not care if his client is innocent or guilty and does not want to know. He does not want anyone involved on his legal team to \\"grow a conscience.\\"  The job of the defense is to plant enough seeds of doubt with the jury during trial, if it gets that far, that the jury will not find his client guilty. Innocence or not has nothing to do with the case or his actions.<br /><br />In between defending Lisa Trammel and discovering dirt on others involved, Haller spends a large portion of the book lecturing on the foreclosure crisis currently still gripping the nation. One sided at best, such ranting lectures will no doubt polarize readers as well as pad the word count while stopping the story dead in its tracks. These information dump rants are numerous and repeatedly kill any movement of the story forward while also greatly over simplifying the situation. Story momentum is also frequently stopped dead by Haller's constant self-references as well as public statements to others on his team that as a defense attorney he does not care if his clients are guilty or innocent. A theme that has been hammered to death for several books now.<br /><br />A theme that is also blasted apart in the last dozen or so pages when Haller does something so unbelievable it creates a laugh out loud moment for many long time readers of this series. The result is a read that is average at best and one that is far below the good quality novel readers expect from the very talented Michael Connelly. While an average read created by Michael Connelly is far better than a lot of what is out there these days, this book is a real disappointment as the author can and has done so much better in the past.<br /><br />One hopes this is not a sign of things to come where this author is weakened by the current state of publishing today that demands major name authors to crank out multiple books in multiple series faster and faster. That short sighted publishing philosophy weakens the quality of books in general and harms readers in the long run.<br /><br />Material supplied by the good people of the Plano, Texas Public Library System.<br /><br />Kevin R.

B000002LHX|5.0|Anyone knows that after \\"Purple Rain\\",\\"Under The Cherry Moon\\" etc, as far as soundtracks go, Prince was bound to bust out with something spectacular, contraversial and jammin. \\"Batman\\", the soundtrack was just that. With hits like \\"Electric Chair\\" & \\"Scandalous\\", it's awesome for dancing, or just listening to. And the cd cover makes a nice screensaver...LOL. Another great addition to any music collection. After all, it's PRINCE!!

B004SBX112|2.0|Latest update causes it to crash on load of summer. The website says to make sure you have a connection before the first load. That fixed it for the first load, but now it crashes even with a signal.  An app as popular a this has no excuse for such a big bug. The fact that they haven't fixed it right away is unbelievable. Even if it means removing ads until they have a fix, which is likely the cause of the problem.

0399250573|5.0|The way I think of Alex Rider books are that they are thrillers for teens. Alex has been through a lot in his life, and for people that have read the previous 8 books, you know that. Highlights in Alex Rider's spy career in MI6 include encounters with the terrorist organization of Scorpia.    In this book, Scorpia is back. The mission: Kill Alex Rider.    While a bit slow at times, this is a book that had me reading for hours at a time. I could barley put it down, and the final few chapters were so exciting I was litterally getting goosebumps. You can actually sense the way Alex has grown from the boy finding out his uncle is dead to the boy holding a gun taking down terrorist organizations.    Every loose end from previous books are tied up in excellent fashion, and the ending also holds a reveal for a main plot point in the book. Awesome way to finish off a series that managed to stay on top of it's game for 9 books, something not many authors can do.

B004FGMDOQ|3.0|First of all, there should be a warning when a book is obviously intended to be the first in a series, not just a story within itself. I resent getting through over 300 pages only to find out the story isn't over. That aside, this is an entertaining and well-written read that ultimately feels a little too familiar. The pictures are definitely intriguing and Riggs certainly knows how to turn a phrase. But it lacked the originality and the magic I was hoping for. Also, warning to Kindle users: the photos don't look so great on the screen. Better off buying the actual book.
B004G6009U|5.0|We had very low expectations for this movie after seeing the pathetic trailer. But everyone we knew that had seen it just loved it so we gave it a chance. We watched the Blu-ray on a great system and were just blown away! The movie is fantastic and easily up there with Beauty and The Beast and Little Mermaid. The best \\"classic\\" Disney tale of the CG age! If you've seen the horrible trailer with a Prince on a Horse asking Rapunzel to let down her hair and then get clobbered by the mass of hair - hilarious right? No. That is NOT in the movie and was designed as the centerpiece of the brilliant (not) marketing plan.     No spoilers here - just watch the movie! Watch the Blu-ray if you can... surround sound even better and enjoy the ride: laughs, suspense, drama, love, great music and songs and superb animation!

0525425578|4.0|I was in the airport book store and selected a paperback John Grisham novel to read on the plane.(The first Theodore Boone book) After reading awhile I realized it was for young people, but I enjoyed it anyhow. As a former teacher I always liked sampling literature meant for young people. My husband also read and liked it too. So I was happy to order and read the second book in Grisham's kid lawyer series, \\"The Abduction.\\" It was as good as the first. I am glad Amazon brought it to my attention. Grisham has created quite a young character. I am saving the two books for our grandsons to enjoy next year when they visit. The ten year old should be ready now. Good for all ages, say 10 to 90.
B0051BVQFG|5.0|It's a reminder that one of the amazing things about people is we are often at our best when things are at there worst. As others have said this movie is nothing new. However, the Marine platoon perspective is great. It's the small battles, the individual effort that can turn the tide of the war. It's also a great reminder of our men and women over seas who have been seemingly forgot by the American people.

B000GH2YPG|5.0|...almost as good as \\"Frenchman's Creek\\" and \\"The House on the Strand\\" which are my DuMaurier favorites. Definitely a 5 star novel!<br /><br />I just got the book \\"Blind Windows\\" by Edwina Levin MacDonald via Inter Library Loan and was in vain searching for ANY slight similarities with \\"Rebecca\\". The book was sooo boring (it takes place in New Orleans) that I stopped after 50 pages. There are some old books from the early forties or thirties that are definitely worth reading like \\"The Woman in Red\\" by Anthony Gilbert or \\"The Blank Wall\\" by Elizabeth Sanxony Holding and even \\"Now Voyager!\\" by Olive Higgins Prouty, but \\"Blind Windows\\" surely is not one of those, believe me: it is plain boring. Period.<br /><br />After 50 pages of Southern atmosphere I finally gave up (what a waste of time!), because my hope to discover anything that reminds of \\"Rebecca\\" was not fulfilled.<br />So now I can understand all that fuss about plagiarism (sp?) even less, because it does not even have any similarities with \\"Rebecca\\".<br /><br />And even if the similarities would start showing up somewhere on page 100+, why did Mrs. MacDonald even bother suing Daphne DuMaurier for plagiarism???<br />\\"Blind Windows\\" was released in 1927 (was it even released in the UK?...as far as I know DuMaurier never put her foot on American soil before the late forties when her American publisher invited her to the US...but o.k. lets suppose she got a worn out copy of \\"Blind Windows\\" while she was in Egypt with her husband in the mid thirties and homesick for Cornwall and got a little inspired by this novel...who cares???).<br /><br />So by the time \\"Rebecca\\" was published (1938), Mrs. MacDonald had already sold her book many many times and it was rather unlikely that the publication of \\"Rebecca\\" took any readers/profit away from her.<br /><br />Read \\"Rebecca\\", don't waste your time and money on this one (or only request it at the public library).
B004A8ZX28|5.0|Exciting, action-packed, with more twists than one. I became a pretty big fan of Liam Neeson after watching Taken. Basically this movie will not only keep you guessing what is going on, but it provides one big twist in the end. I can usually figure out the plot line of most movies today, but this one threw me for a loop. The setting is in Berlin, Germany and Liam Neeson's character knows who he is, but why does no one else? It seems an impostor has taken over his life and convinced his wife and countless other people that Liam isn't who he claims to be. How will he get out of this mess? Not only does he not have the answers, his life is at risk, someone is trying to kill him. Definitely worth the watch and worth buying if you're a fan of Liam like me.

B0051OZ564|5.0|The movie is visually stunning. Its the attention to detail that puts it over the top. I have to admit that it is confusing at first to grasp the premise. But the movie just gets better as it goes. I'm rarely impressed by the soundtrack of movies in this genre but ir was done artistically and made the movie more appealing. The way the story is told In this movie is what I would expect from an action oriented film. Its a must see in my opinion.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|First off, I would like to state this book was absolutely incredible. The beginning of the book began a bit slow. It began with her dealing with the consequences of stabbing the beast in the last book and how it affected her. After moving on from the death of the beast, she then begans her quest again of trying to capture the Sinsar Dubh. She get helps from an unlikely enemy. Overall the book is a complete shocker. You find out who killed Alina and the reason why. Also, you discover a few dark things about Mac and v'lane. Overall every question you have been waiting to be answered will be in this book. The ending of the book took me for a complete surprise even though a year ago I had guessed a shocking secret about one of the main characters. I was surprised because I didnt expect to be right. I was so rooting for V'lane to get with Mackayla. However, I know realize that will never be a possibility because of a big surprise. I would highly recommend this book to anyone. If Karen Moning writes more books, I will be the first to purchase them without a doubt.

B003Y58CKS|2.0|I beg to differ with all those who give this dvd 5, 4, even 3 stars. To say that I was disappointed is to put it mildly. Based on the strength of the cast, I thought that this would be an excellent addition to my collection. Instead, I kept wondering why I wasted my money on this dvd. Having just heard barely three weeks ago a wonderful staged performance of Rigoletto--sung by two unknowns who can put both Lucic and Damrau to shame-- I must conclude that some singers have better luck than others.    Let's not dwell on the shortcomings of the production, which are plenty. The nudity in act I is unnecessary; the blue cubicle in the second part of the same act is distracting and the embrace of the Duke and Gilda during the quartet in Act III is totally absurd. Also ludicrous is having Gilda sing the entire finale standing up, when she's supposed to be dying! It's not as if Diana Damrau doesn't have the breath control required to sing sitting or even lying on her back, as she demonstrates during Caro Nome. Gilda herself comes across as a spoiled brat, not as a sheltered, naive young girl. It may be that Damrau sees her as a stronger personality that we are accustomed, but I don't get the feeling that she identifies with the part. And the masks!! I found myself laughing out loud at times. Frankly, I think this production is pathetic.    But opera is after all about singing. On that score, I find that Lucic never rises to the part. While he has a beautiful voice, I don't think he \\"owns\\" the character yet--or at least did not when this video was recorded. His \\"Si vendetta\\" lacks force, to say the least. Damrau's singing is perhaps not as sweet as I expected; however, her technique and breath control are admirable. Florez, while in splendid voice, seems ill at ease most of the time,which detracts from his performance. Zeppenfeld has the dark bass for Sparafucile but his acting makes the character seem like a madman, which Sparafucile is not. Maddalena acquits herself decently. The minor characters I found sub par.    I'm fairly certain that I will not be watching this Rigoletto again. Perhaps if I just listen to it, it may sound different. But I give it only 2 stars, which I think is more than plenty.
1572814748|3.0|I use the regular sized Universal-Waite deck and thought having a small version to keep in my purse would be great.    As another reviewer mentioned, this deck has a grainy colorization to it. To me, it is as if I am looking at the card deck while wearing a pair of sunglasses or looking at it through dark tinted glass. The colors are more washed and a little deeper. The colors are bright but dark at the same time. Whomever the printer was, needed to turn up the brightness and saturation on these images!    The cards themselves seem only slightly better than the feel and thickness of an index card or Rolodex card. I have to admit I was expecting more.    This deck will grow on me. I don't hate it but don't love it. I just wish the colors and quality of card stock was as nice as they could have made it for the amount I paid for them. The box is nice and holds the cards respectfully, which I do like.

1419336916|5.0|This was a pleasant surprise for me.  I had read and watched a couple of other things by McEwan before.  I found his writing a bit cold and contrived, containing somewhat cynical explorations of the dark side of things and the tendency of people to eventually reveal their real, ugly, animal natures.  This was something very different - a long and detailed romantic and family drama, set in the period shortly before and during World War II (and in which the war plays a big role).  It is something of a psychological thriller as well, and turns on a young girl's identification of a man who supposedly molested her.  Unlike some of the author's other things, this deals with serious issues in a serious way.  It is also very carefully and evocatively written, and Jill Tanner's precise reading is a perfect fit for the material.    Young Robbie is a student at Cambridge.  He is the talented son of working class parents, and he lives adjacent to the estate of the upper class Tallis clan, where his father was a gardener.  Tallis pere is a government minister, and he is sponsoring Robbie's education.  Of course, he knows the whole clan, and he and his fellow Cambridge student, Cecilia Tallis, have long harbored a repressed and secret attraction to each other.  The action takes place during a summer gathering of relatives and friends at the estate.  McEwan painstakingly outlines the goings-on, particularly from the viewpoint of 11(?) year-old Briony Tallis, Cecilia's sister, a girl of dramatic sensibilities who is planning to put on a play she has written for the group, using her young cousins as cast members.  Robbie writes a lusty letter to Cecilia which he never intended to send to her, but he accidentally substitutes it for another letter.  The expected rejection does not take place, and instead Robbie and Cecilia start getting it on . . . at which point the story takes a dark turn.  There is a sexual molestation, and someone, possibly the wrong man, is blamed.      The action then shifts to the war, in which Robbie is a soldier, part of the retreat to Dunkirk.  The two sisters are both serving as military nurses in London hospitals.  There is a lot of description of the war, and of life (and death) in the hospital.  As the action draws to a climax.  Briony, now a well-known professional writer in 1995 and looking at the end of her days, reveals what really occurred and what the attempted atonement is.  There is a sad note here, as the reader realizes that her attempt to set things right cannot fully exist in the real world, where justice and fulfillment are ultimately elusive.  This book makes me think that McEwan may very well have developed quite a bit as an artist over the years, and that a number of his other books might possess the level of virtuosity that \\"Atonement\\" does.  If so, they are very much worth a look.

B003I87O2I|5.0|I saw them live about a year before this album was released and I was amazed at Kelly's vocals. Dare I say it but I think he is actually a better vocalist than the great Lou Gramm.  He has awesome range and can sing in a slightly higher octave and still hit all the low notes.  I think Kelly is one of the best singers in rock and roll and Mick Jones certainly picked a gem to replace Gramm.  The band sounded great as they played all their hits and I eagerly anticipated new music.  This CD is very good.  Yes, it has a few too many ballads but the production, songwriting, playing, singing and most importantly the hooks are all there.  \\"Can't Slow Down\\" is a strong rocker to open the album.  \\"In Pieces\\" is a very good power ballad follow up and I think a better choice for the first single compared to the boring \\"When it Comes to Love.\\"  Then my favorite song \\"Living in a Dream\\" is next and it is full of hooks and one of those I can just listen to over and over.  The intro guitar sounds like classic .38 Special.  The remaining tracks are all pretty good and even the rehash of \\"Fool for you Anyway\\" from the first album is an improvement form the original.  Buy this CD if you like melodic rock and I hope they continue doing new music and don't just tour on the old stuff year after year.

B0001HLVS2|4.0|The year was 1805 at the height of the Napoleonic Wars.  France and England were in a seemingly relentless life and death struggle for control of the seas.  In those days the oceans were where the major battles were fought.  Captain \\"Lucky\\" Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) has drawn an especially difficult assignment.  As Commander of the British man-of-war \\"Surprise\\" he has been ordered to pursue the bigger, faster and highly elusive French privateer \\"Acheron\\" and \\"burn, sink or take her a prize.\\"  Furthermore, unbeknownst to his crew Aubrey has been ordered to chase the \\"Acheron\\" all the way to Brazil and beyond if necessary.  \\"Master and Commander:  The Far Side of the World\\" is director Peter Weir's unforgettable account of this high stakes game of cat and mouse.  This is not the kind of film that I ordinarily enjoy very much but much to my surprise it worked for me on a great many levels.<br /><br />As the film opens we find the \\"Surprise\\" under attack by the \\"Acheron\\".  In the course of this battle royale the \\"Surprise\\" is severely damaged and its rudder disabled.  Although I am not usually a big fan of special effects I thought that they were used quite effectively in this film.  I definitely got the sense of what it must be like to be a participant in such a battle  It was painfully realistic I thought.  Meanwhile, in retaliation \\"Surprise\\" manages to score several direct hits on the French boat.  Unfortunately the cannon balls were unable to penetrate the hull of this newly designed ship.  If it were not for the fact that the \\"Surprise\\" was able to manuever itself into a foggy patch this ongoing battle would have been over right then and there.  Much to the chagrin of his crew Captain Aubrey vows to track down and capture or destroy his nemesis \\"no matter the cost\\".  Many of the men complain that this is a suicide mission and want no part of it.  We follow the crew of the \\"Surprise\\" as it pursues the \\"Acheron\\" down the east coast of South America.  One of the things that is most striking about this crew is that many of the sailors appear to be just teenagers.  In fact there are a few young boys on the ship who seem to be only 12 or 13 years old!  I simply cannot imagine being placed in these kind of circumstances at such a tender age.<br /><br />Along the way we meet other members of the crew.  Paul Bettany does a workmanlike job in his portrayal of Dr. Stephen Maturin the ship surgeon.  Maturin is a close personal friend of Captain Aubrey and is not afraid to tell the boss when he is convinced that he is making the wrong decision.  We also catch a glimpse of how the officers and crew spend their down time.  We discover that Captain Aubrey enjoys playing of all things the violin!  My wife especially enjoyed the work of James D'Arcy as First Lt. Thomas Pullings and Edward Woodall as Second Lt. William Mowett.  She is a big fan of Charles Dickens and noted that these colorful charactors could have been created by Dickens himself!  One of the most poignant scenes in \\"Master and Commander\\" is when Captain Aubrey has to make a split-second decision to cut loose a young sailor who went overboard while trying to repair a sail.  It seems that the mast snapped and fell over dumping the young man into the sea with it.  Tragically, the weight of the mast threatened to capsize the entire boat and so the decision was made to cut the mast loose to save the crew.  It was a heartbreaking moment to say the least.  Oh, the burdons of command!<br /><br />The pursuit of the \\"Acheron\\" continued right around Cape Horn at the bottom of South America and right on into the Pacific.  Before the final climactic battle the ''Surprise\\" stops at the Galapagos Islands.  While there we catch a glimpse of some of the exotic birds and mammals that are indigenous to this island.  For just a brief moment you get the feeling that you are watching some kind of sci-fi flick. Dr. Maturin has been waiting all his life to see specimens like this but duty calls andthe Captain orders the ship onward and outward in pursuit of its real prize.  Before long the pivotal final battle will take place.<br /><br />I was quite surprised to learn that \\"Master and Commander\\"  The Far Side of the World\\" is one of the most expensive movies ever made. This film was nominated for an impressive total of 10 Academy Awards including \\"Best Picture\\" and came away with two awards.  I thought that the photography throughout this film was magnificent.  Meanwhile, I would be remiss if I failed to make mention of the incredible music score much of which was written and perfomed by the noted Australian violinist Richard Tognetti (no relation).  In fact,  Mr. Tognetti acually coached Russell Crowe on how to play the violin in preparation for this film.  One final word.  \\"Master and Commander:  The Far Side of the World\\" is a great family movie.  Just be prepared for a couple of scenes that feature some very necessary but gruesome medical procedures performed by Dr. Maturin.  The good doctor even assists in surgery on himself!  As the President might say this could be used as one of those \\"teachable moments\\" to explain to your kids about the horrors of war.  \\"Master and Commander\\"  turns out to be a film that greatly exceeded my expectations.

B002JCSWV6|5.0|It has been an awfully long time since I have been wowed by a movie.  But that was precisely my reaction to the new Clint Eastwood film \\"Invictus\\" which debuted in theaters across America today.<br />\\"Invictus\\" recalls the 1995 Rugby World Cup tourney which was held in South Africa.  The World Cup was the first major sporting event to take place in South Africa following the end of apartheid.  But this is by no means a movie about rugby.  Rather it is the compelling story about the courage and vision of two men....two very different men.<br /><br />Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) was the recently elected President of South Africa.  Here was a man who had spent most of his adult life courageously opposing the entrenched system of legal racial seperation in his beloved homeland known as \\"aparteheid\\".  Mandela had certainly paid a stiff price for his divergent political views.  In the late 1950's and early 1960's he was an anti-apartheid activist, and the leader of the African National Congress's armed wing Umkhonto we Sizwe.  Mandela was loathed by the entrenched British establishment that was searching for ways to get rid of him once and for all.  Mandela was tried and conviced of sabotage and other crimes against the state by the prevailing National Party back in 1963.  Despite persistent calls for his release from political and religious leaders and from governments around the world Mandela would spend the next 27 years of his life in a prison cell.  While incarcerated Mandela read extensively and had plenty of time to ponder his philosophy of life.  He envisioned  that one day South Africa would become a color-blind \\"Rainbow Nation\\".  Mandela was finally released from prison in 1990 and in 1994 he was elected President of South Africa.  Shortly after his inauguration  President Mandela cast about for innovative ways to bring his disjointed nation together again.  He determined that the 1995 Rugby World Cup tournament to be held in his homeland to be the perfect vehicle to achieve his lifelong dream of a truly united South Africa.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Francois Pineaar (Matt Damon) was the captain of the South African Rugby team known as Springbok.  The team was not very good and there was but one black man on the club.  Springbok's prospects in the upcoming tourney were dismal.  Yet with the odds clearly stacked against him Mandela decided to  gamble most of his political capital and personal prestige and made it a national priority to win the World Cup.  He met with Pineaar several months before the competition.  Although from very different backgrounds the two men quickly discovered that they were kindred spirits.  Each was bound and determined to make this \\"impossible dream\\" become a reality.<br /><br />Although Matt Damon's star shines brightly in \\"Invictus\\" Morgan Freeman clearly steals this show.  I found it to be be one of those rare performances where I could simply not take my eyes off him.  He was that compelling!  I would compare Freeman's performance in this film to Jimmy Stewart's in \\"Rear Window\\" or perhaps more precisely to George C. Scott in \\"Patton\\".  \\"Invictus\\" is an extremely well-crafted and uplifting film that should earn numerous Oscar nominations. Clint Eastwood has outdone himself this time.

B002XMGGK6|2.0|There's something to be said for a movie that's exactly what it advertises itself to be. I loaded up \\"Law Abiding Citizen\\" because all the trailers had promised me a gloriously shlocky revenge caper combining the revenge elements of Death Wish with the over the top planning of the Saw series.     And it does have some of that style. Cars are attacked with weaponized bomb squad robots, government officials get killed through wacky cell phone bombs, and other over the top methods of destruction. In the style of many hokey violent movies, a character exists purely to give a speech on how thoroughly trained and bad ass Clyde Sheldon is.     But oh lord does it lose steam every time it thinks its making an interesting point. The movies notion that the justice system isn't working because it just isn't brutal and vengeful enough is never given enough teeth to be meaningful. The way Sheldon's family is murdered in the beginning is nonsensical and is never given much context. Bad men enter his house and kill people, because old men firmly believe that this is a thing that happens all the time. Wouldn't reprisal have represented a more compelling reason? Evil men don't deliberately murder your family without some sort of pretext. Maybe his sketchy military weapons history would have inspired it? But no, they're evil bad men who did it because they're drug-using criminal scum.    He loses of course, because that's how it has to happen in a Hollywood film, but the moralizing delivered by Academy Award Winning Jamie Foxx feels like a lazy bit of tacked on finger-wagging.    I think this movie would have benefited from going either more exploitive or more poignant. The belligerently conservative Old Testament God moralizing about the judicial system seems weird and clumsy, and doesn't match well with the ludicrous plot twists necessary to make the trashy narrative possible.    Make a point. Make entertainment, but don't half-ass both.

Buy or rent the DVD, you will not be dissapointed. I hear that the actor who played Spartacus (Andy Whitfield who was amazing) was unable to revise his roll due to an illiness. There is no one that can play Spartacus like he did. But I will try to like the new person that they have now in the roll to be Spartacus. I know the series is still going to be good even without the Andy in it. I hope to see him in something soon and I pray that his recovery is going well and maybe he can come back if Starz pickup another season may 4? Manu Bennett(Crixus), AHHH!, what can I say, he was fantastic in his roll too. I am a big fan of his also and all the cast were awesome. I also ordered the prequel which I believe is due out in September. I can't wait to get it. Now awaiting for the new series to begin.    Long Live Spartacus(Andy Whitfield) !!!       G.A.B.

B003UBTX72|5.0|I was very surprised to find that I liked this so much -- Keith is a fabulous, hilarious storyteller, and an insightful observer as well as participant in many of the massive cultural changes that occurred in the latter half of the 20th Century.<br /><br />As a Stones fan I also enjoyed his behind-the-scenes accounts of the recordings of so many great songs and albums, in addition to the usual tour stories and excesses galore.<br /><br />I will say that Keith remains in denial about certain events in his life, and doesn't seem to want to admit that his drug/alcohol habit was responsible for much of the chaos in his life.<br /><br />Still, it's his book and he's entitled to view his life and Mick any way he wants.<br /><br />He managed to produce a great autobiography, one that sets the bar high for the many copycat accounts that are sure to follow.
B003EQN6C6|5.0|I don't know what got me to look to see if Linda Perhacs had ever been re-issued ... but I was shocked to see it. The only reason I even heard the LP when it came out was I happened to be in a hippie-dippie record store at the time and it was on the PA. I bought it then and there. But the album seemed to disappear overnight as friends that liked the LP couldn't find it.  It faded quickly, but remained a treasure in my collection ... along with incredible gems such as \\"Miraculous Hump Returns From the Moon\\" by Sopwith Camel, and Zephyr's \\"Sunset Ride\\" ... LPs that disappeared and tantalized my friends. No I won't loan it out! ... The songs on this album showcase remarkable talent and sensitivity. I was surprised that there was nothing else.  She is in a word ... like her song ... \\"Delicious\\"
B0011U8NZ2|4.0|Back we go to another legendary performance by the Doors! Morrison's vocal antics and Manzurek's organ make the entire CD a rock-n-roll delight! Some rare Doors finds like 'Away In India' and 'Someday Soon' will only make you chuckle regarding Mr. Mojo Risin's pre-occupation!
B0021L8V0W|5.0|If you are a fan of Jolie's action characters, you will like this movie.  I believe the movie is well made, as well as great acting.  Of course, it is a stretch for reality...but, very entertaining.  And, I was on the edge of my seat for almost the entire movie.
031603441X|5.0|What am I going to do now that I've finished this book! I'm going to be missing my daily dose of Keith.  I loved it; It was written in a very conversational style.  I felt like Keith was accross the table from me, sharing a drink & telling me all his good stories.  I'm sure there's parts of his life he's kept completely private, doesn't tell - but he tells enough to interest the average Joe, like me.  Got to say, I've always loved the Rolling Stones and been a big fan, but I didn't know much about KR; after reading I found him not only a really likeable guy, I really admired his unapologetic telling of his story, not that he doesn't say he didn't screw up here and there, but he didn't let that define him & carried on w/Life. I found myself listening to old Stones songs, like \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\" to figure out the nuances of sound he writes about.  I think if you play the guitar, you'd really enjoy reading how he describes songwriting & find rhythms.  If you're a Stones fan, I think you'll really like this book - if you've never heard of Keith Richards - you'll like this book - after all, I said, \\"he's a likeable guy\\".
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|I ordered this Bluray after I read a lot of buzz online indicating it was a good film.  I was not exptecting much from the film as I expected a low budget quality.  I was, however, surprised with how well the fill was made.  Also, the film kept my interest throughout.      It makes a nice addtion to my Bluray collection.
0439023521|5.0|I had a feeling that I was expecting too much out of this series. For its huge popularity and a movie coming out, I thought that it might be too hyped up. However, I was surprised to see how much I truly enjoyed it.   There are only a handful of books/series that I stayed up all night reading. The Hunger Games has made it on that list. Once I opened up that book, I never put it down until the very end. It was so different from anything I've ever read and had such a suspenseful atmosphere. It's hard to find a book that grabs your attention immediately and successfully keeps it, but The Hunger Games did just that. If you miss that feeling of being so into a story and wondering \\"What's going to happen next?\\", get The Hunger Games. Once I finished, I immediately went to a store to get the second one.
B004A8ZX2S|5.0|How we are initiated into the World, make sense of this fleeting Dream, rumbling under the echoes of where we've come from and to where we go, all ripple through this brilliant testimony of the Opening Heart.  Loved this movie.
0316098329|5.0|Room, a fantastic story, is the first I read from Emma Donoghue's stories. I never knew about this author, but when I read the back cover at the mega-store, I felt the plot had action that will please me. In fact, it was probably the book that dragged me and could not escape. I found myself sleeping 4 hours late than the time which I usually sleep at, that's because I was reading Room. Not only was the plot dragging me, it was the simple language that came from the protagonist, Jack, a five-year old that made the story easy and entertaining to read. In those 4 hours I have read almost half the book, but then I realised I have to leave some for later!!!!    Anyway, great book. Would recommend it to young adults and everyone else! Great book, very fresh ideas! I thank you, Emma Donoghue!
0312600844|2.0|Previously I have really enjoyed Oprah Book Club selections.  This one, not so much... which makes me wonder who, or what the qualifications are for the list ($?).  This book left me wanting.  It was so long and drab that I had to break it up and read things in between.  I have about 20% left (I have it on my kindle), and I don't want to give up but it's such a chore!  Total disappointment.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|where is the Zen garden. please add it pop cap! that was a fun distraction after beating the game. I'm not seeing it.
B0051T46XM|5.0|Troll Hunter is the best 'found footage' movie yet IMHO.  5 Stars for a movie with beautiful scenery, a good story, and some very humorous moments.
B000002HO3|5.0|If you enjoyed the CD and or the DVD \\"Home\\" in Sicily, you will love this CD. Every song that isn't on the \\"Home\\" CD you will find on this CD and it is wonderful. You can't help but sing to all of Mick's songs.  He puts so much into each song he sings, you know that he is definately feelings the words that he is singing.  Favorites like \\"Holding Back the Years\\", \\"Night Nurse\\", \\"Thrill Me\\" and \\"Fairgrounds\\" are among the favorites on this CD.  Buy it, you'll be glad you made the investment.
0439023521|5.0|I had originally decided to read this book because I saw that a few of my friends had started reading it.  As soon as I started reading the Hunger Games, I couldn't stop.  I read the first book that day.  The next day I bought the second book to the series and read that the same day.  The following day I finished the third and final book of the series.  This is honestly one of the best books I have ever read.  It is action-packed and has an interesting and original plot.  I've recommended this book to my friends and they are all hooked on the Hunger Games!
1400052181|4.0|Rebecca Skloot's book gives science a human face.  All too often we forget that science is created by individuals, and Skloot restores that aspect.  Henrietta Lacks was victimized by poverty, racism and medicine.  I especially enjoyed the way that Skloot weaves the story of her own research into the story.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I'd never read \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but I happened on this British TV miniseries. It's funny, poignant, and suspenseful: an absolute gem.<br /><br />I knew that I had seen the female lead somewhere before. She was in the 2005 science fiction movie \\"Sound of Thunder.\\" That was pretty good, too.
0399536108|2.0|Chris basically organizes the ideas of non-conformity in a hodge-podge way. His attitude is very clear and it seems that he was one of the fortunate people on the planet to be in the right place at the right time, which he does not mention at all as actually being a factor in the ability to accomplish their dreams and really live a life that does not conform to the status-quo. This was surprising to me, since in a universe and a world that is constantly moving and changing being at the right place at the right time is everything. So yes, get this book if you don't know how to make yourself happy and are just another person oblivious to how exciting life can really be, but how would you even acquire or know this book exists if you were such a person. Since you found this book on amazon and are reading this review, trust me, skip this one and look for something better. You will agree with most of his ideas since you know them in your mind already. By being interested in non-conformity itself you already are a non-conformist. This book helps you a little bit to hone your non-conformity skills, but doesn't really give you anything rock solid since Chris' life doesn't really seem that much better than your own. If this was written by someone with similar dreams as me I would enjoy it more. He seems to live a life that really doesn't have any other purpose than not having an boss and/or any real job skills other than how to write a book and a blog and travel which anyone can do. He writes about living your dream life but it doesn't seem like what Chris is actually doing was a dream of his, he kind of just made big changes in his life without really having it planned out as his life goal. His book deal and blog kind of fell into his lap, and then goes on to tell you about how to structure life goals and be very specific about your dreams and goals... kind of contradicting the way he went about getting to where he is in life. He seems to be more of an anarchist than a non-conformist at times.
0307716511|5.0|I consider myself a thriller snob. I have read so many that I usually either figure out what's going on too quickly, or the conclusion is so far-fetched and ridiculous you are sorry you wasted your time on the book. This book, however, is intelligent, well-written, sensitive and interesting. It is not just a whodunit, the author actually takes the time to develop three-dimensional characters you grow to care about. As an American, I also found the tid-bits of British life interesting and engaging. Even the ending is pretty good. A winner all around!
B0002DRDBE|3.0|This is one of those movies that anyone can make and it's so simple, yet, it's amazing. In my opinion it's Kevin Smith's best film to date.<br />This edition is a three disk set with:<br />Disk One-<br />Clerks (Theatrical movie)<br />Classic Commentary Circa '95<br />\\"Clerks\\" The Lost Scene<br />The Flying Car<br />Trailer<br />Music Video<br />Clerks Restored intros<br />Original auditions<br />Disk Two-<br />Clerks The First Cut (The movie, but with added scenes and has all the grain from the original version of Clerks before it was bought by Miramax)<br />All new video commentary<br />Disk Three-<br />Mae Day: The Crumbling of a documentary<br />10th Anniversary Q&A<br />Outtakes from Snowball effect<br />Still photos<br />Original Kevin Smith Journal<br />Articles and reviews<br /><br />This edition, from what I know, is just a bulky before Blu-Ray DVD package. I've heard that on the 15th anniversary edition (Blu-Ray) there is more, but it's also the same features as this one.<br /><br />Now about how I received it; when I opened it, it was perfect. Not opened, or anything. Then on closer look, it looks like someone dropped it down 50 stairs. The disks are fine, but the package was dent and cracked. Disappointed at the way it was shipped.<br /><br />So it's worth it only if you don't have Blu-Ray, or if you, Like me, Collect limited editions and Blu-Ray Editions.<br />I give it three stars (This product should have a four star rating, but I was displeased with shipping.)
B004FEJ3VY|3.0|Gave this to my son for his birthday to add to his collection. He liked the toy and it was not difficult to learn the transformation. He did have one complaint regarding the lack of the sword as shown in the movie. He also thought some sounds would have been nice but he loves transformers so he's good
B0000640SA|5.0|This movie is brilliant. 'Nuff said. Now about the DVDs. They are confusing on their own. I recommend going here: [...] only because you will need it to access the menus. They are confusing.<br />Some people hate the movie for the fact that i'ts too confusing, but if you want, if you insert disk II you can watch it in chronological order. Here's how:<br />* Select clock (third row, third column)<br />* Press &lt;Enter> or click \\"C\\" (five times)<br />* Select pictures in order 3-4-1-2<br />There now you have an Easter egg version of Memento in chronological order like you've probably heard of. Well, it's not a myth.
B0034G4ORC|1.0|Just like district 9 this movie sucked. The acting was first a horrible job. And why do you think no great actors were in this movie. Because the plot was bad. The movie had little story to it and the action that did take place was lame. I really wish i did not waste a hour and a half of my time watching it.
B002ZCY7SW|4.0|Overall, the DVD was great.  There was one in the set that apparently had scratches or someting because it kept stopping and starting, so only got to watch about 1/2 of that episode.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|this collection has everything that fans of the movies could ever hope to have and the remastering is bright and vivid showing the original aged very well!
B002TLSSXO|5.0|I like the look of these but it helps that they are also functional. Keeps the mess off of the counter which is great. I wasn't sure about the price but when just shopping for new spatulas noticed that these are priced pretty right on with others.
B003UYUR10|4.0|Our video came with a warning that it was for 12+, and I strongly agree and caution parents. While this is a Disney product, it is NOT as light hearted or cartoonish as the Pirates of the Caribbean series. The violence and Foley effects (sound effects) of squishy stabbings are a bit too gruesome.<br /><br />The plot centers around three brothers, sons of a King of an ancient Persian Empire, who uncover sedition on their boarders, and invade a Holy City, which enrages their father the King. One son is the first-born heir, the other a military general, and the third a loveable rogue, who was adopted by the king for an act of bravery in his adolescence.<br /><br />The Holy city holds a mysterious secret, and a beautiful girl who guards it, and provides a wonderful McGuffin of button-button-who's-got-the button for the rest of the romp.<br /><br />The acting is fine, and there are characters by the dozens. Lots of elements are heavily borrowed from Raiders of the Lost Ark, and similar action adventure stories, but the plot never drags and the hero and heroine have an amusing friction as they fall in love through their trials.<br /><br />Sadly, Ben Kingsley's make-up makes him look odd, but it was delightful to see him and he does his usual excellent job. Jake shares his chiseled good looks and apparently does a lot of his own stunts, it was only afterwards that I learned the film is a derivative of a video game, but many of the intricate acrobatics make sense once you learn this.<br /><br />The movie is quite long, but doesn't really flag. Our 12-year-old daughter and my wife both enjoyed it, although you would have guesssed the film was pitched for teenage boys.<br /><br />Once again, be very cautious on the violence, this is not for the eyes of those in their tender years.<br /><br />Final word, we are a very conservative traditional Catholic family, so we are cautious about movies with to much \\"magic\\" in them and distortions of the supernatural. While there is a strong element essential to the plot that involves \\"the [g]ods\\" within the context of the film it makes sense and while I did discuss these elements with my children, they had the good sense to recognize the difference between the film's structure of fantasy and reality. But not every parent, particularly conservative Christian parents increasingly concerned about our continually coarsening world where the demonic is accepted as normal, would come to the same conclusion. Pre-screen everything is always my advice before letting your kids watch anything.ds\\" within the context of the film it makes sense and while I did discuss these elements with my children, they had the good sense to recognize the difference between the film's structure of fantasy and reality.

0740797719|5.0|Simply put, this book is an unreal bargain for the information contained inside.  IF you have not (like me) attended formal illustration classes at a top art school, you MUST OWN THIS BOOK, AND READ IT COVER TO COVER.  It will be worth the $17 pittance even if you get 1/10th the information it contains.  BUY IT.
B005529BDK|4.0|different from other shoot em up and match 3 games because you can flip the coins. smooth gameplay, nice graphics, different characters, cool game all around. Optimus V.
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|Please note, the bonus features are mostly just documentary footage about the artwork and the music and what makes it Final Fantasy. Not much else.<br /><br />This is a good movie, but the game is much more enjoyable, and you do not want to watch this until you play through the entire game.
B0058VW36U|3.0|Cut the rope is an enjoyable game that makes you think and helps you experience success through multiple failures. The game takes too long to load and often fails to load even after several attempts.
B004WESFZW|4.0|I'm not a big Matt Damon fan, but I did like this movie. Kind of a mix between chick flik and action movie. Good premise and good acting. Ending was pretty obvious, but all in all I'd recommend it.
B004EBUXI0|5.0|That is the best cpu i have ever own, low power consumption, runs very cool at max load 46 degrees Celsius (i think it could be 10 degrees less) when fans is max. I use my built in graphics card to play games and runs great. No lags no problems, (then again i have not max the game settings). I convert movies and play games at the same time still no problems. Movies convert in 25 mins or less. When the pc is idle.    I love this cpu. I cant wait for the ivy bridge to come out and to upgrade.     But honestly i would rather the i72600 100Mhz X4 faster.
0307477479|4.0|I'm not kidding - this book should not make sense. The narrative voice changes with every chapter, it's hard to tell who the main characters really are, and it jumps around chronologically. Despite all that, or maybe because of it, A Visit from the Goon Squad is a great book.    The book is loosely based around Bennie, a music executive who is losing his street cred, and his assistant Sasha. And when I say loosely, I mean loosely. The book contains exactly one chapter told from each of their respective perspectives. Every other chapter is told from the perspective of someone who played a role in one of their lives, both big and small. Each chapter's narrator has a unique voice and style, including PowerPoint presentation, reflective of their character as opposed to Sasha or Bennie. On top of that, the \\"present\\" in this book is constantly changing - some are set in the 1980's, some are in the 2000's, and some are in 2020's. Despite the choppy chronology and shifting narrators, the chapters told by the people in Sasha and Bennie's lives show you much more about who the two main characters and how they came to be who they are, than you learn through their own chapters. Despite not really being about Sasha and Bennie, they fill in the gaps on Sasha and Bennie's lives until you end up with a pretty complete picture of who they were and what they've become.    The theme holding these disparate stories in A Visit from the Goon Squad together is how our lives and dreams shift as we age. When we're young, we start out with big dreams but as we get older we make choices that push our original dreams further away or change our dreams completely, until eventually our older selves and our younger selves seem like two different people instead of two sides of the same person's coin. This sounds like a depressing idea, but in Egan's hands, it's not. She just makes it seems realistic and mature and natural, that given the change that occurs in a typical life, our dreams would changetoo. And since the music industry tends to draw in the dreamers and spit them back out a bit more mangled, it's the perfect vehicle to deliver her point.    In a nutshell: A really good novel despite almost being a set of short stories. Four stars.
1416550550|5.0|This is book our Book Club recommended for our reading.  It is the best book i have read in a long time.  It keeps you supended as to where the story will go.  Very easy reading.  The narrative makes you feel you are there. A book you can't put down.
B003ES5ZPK|4.0|The only problem I had with this is that it's a ittle thick for my TV but after a while it didn't give any problems
0312323867|5.0|I have to admit, after reading Something Borrowed, I really didn't like Darcy. So, reading a book that was based on this character was bumming me out. But I started reading it, and really, really enjoyed it. Emily Giffin is a talented author, and I have now read all of her books...and thoroughly enjoy them!
0061784788|5.0|Scary - not just the supervolcano under Yellowstone, nor the fact that Merrriweather Lewis was actually murdered AND had a buffalo hide but the nanowhatchacallits will scare the life out of you.  I've seen programs on the volcano at Yellowstone since reading the book.  Ready to explode at any time.  I also saw a Decoded program on Lewis - excellent research Rollins - as usual.  This man is a genius and I will read anything he writes - even a cereal box.  Put it on your save shelf.
0446691437|5.0|I'm at a loss for words. It took me a long time to read this little book, because there are so many powerful points along the way that I needed to keep putting it aside to let things really digest. It's not as if none of this has ever been said before, but he's put together important spiritual/emotional truths that are ordinarily not brought together in this way - and yet, it's perfectly practical. I've been giving copies to friends and recommending it to everyone, regardless of whether they think of themselves in terms of art or creative activities. I really wish this book had been marketed better and that the publisher would rethink their approach - it deserves a lot more attention, and not only from artists but from anyone.
0062060554|5.0|Before I Go to Sleep is an absolutely absorbing read. It is one of those books that you really need to clear some time for, because once you begin, you will not be able to put it down.    Christine wakes each morning with a clean slate. Her memories of her life and herself over the last 10 years are gone. She wakes up to a man she doesn't know and the mirror reflects a face that she can hardly recognize. Every morning her husband Ben explains her life and her accident. She begins to take solace in a journal that helps her to remember/record her daily life. Ben is her lifeline to the outside world - but in her journal she finds the words \\"Don't trust Ben.\\"     This is the crux of the elegantly unfolding mystery. The author deftly leads you one way, and then another. You, much like the main character, are never quite sure who, and what memories you can trust.     This is a quick and absorbing read that is perfect for the beach or travel. You'll never notice the minutes tick by!
B004SKQAJI|4.0|To start off M.F. is up to his high standard of dance.  He is totally rocking it once again!  I have the original Lord of The Dance on VHS and the Feet of Flames.  Sorry but Feet of Flames is the best out of the three it gets a 5 star! This newest production would have been awesome to watch if it wasn't for some of the camera angles and way too many cut a-ways at very integral moments in the dances.  The slow motion shots are really annoying. It also seems to me that this is not just one show that was shot.  If you watch closely you will see Bernadette Flynn on the stage left then all of sudden she is stage right before coming to dance in the middle. Also on the \\"Planet Ireland\\" performance she seems to be missing in some shots then back again.  As I was watching it all the way to the end I was wondering where the \\"Siamsa\\" number was.  I found out it is a DELETED SCENE!  Why?!  It is one of my favorite parts.  For those who have never seen one of the Lord of the Dance productions it is a really good start. I encourage though to get the older ones too.  Guess I have been spoiled with the previous ones.
