0321356683|5.0|A great book that you'll go back to time and again as you encounter the various scenarios addressed in the book.  I recommend scanning the TOC every few months to see what's suddenly relevant because of your current project.  A great companion to Java Concurrency in Practice.
0307394549|5.0|I have bought 4 copies of this book to give to friends because I love it.  It is the perfect gift for anyone who likes to bake.  I have been baking one new cookie every week with my son and daughter since we got this book in the summer.<br />What I love is that there are all types of recipes, simple ones and more complex, with a wide variety of flavors.  The book is divided by cookie categories: Light and Delicate, Soft and Chewy, Crumbly and Sandy, Chunky and Nutty, Cakey and Tender, Crisp and Crunchy and Rich and Dense.  Each category is accompanied with beautiful photos of the cookies, which are all shown in the table of contents.  The book has beautiful layout (as always for martha books) and easy to follow recipes.<br /><br />Enjoy!

B0016Q2D5M|3.0|It is a good movie for the family although it was a little difficult to keep the 3D glasses on for the whole show.  It was better in the regular format.  My granddaughter liked it and I would recommend for a family movie.
B000MQ58VS|5.0|Finding Neverland is one of Johnny Depp's best performances.  Why?  Because you look at him and really believe that the dreams of a child still dwell within him.  That's part of the magic of Finding Neverland.  The blu-ray edition is beautiful to look at.  All of the make-believe sequences really stand out.  The audio is solid.  It only contains the special features from the regular DVD, but that's not a big selling point for me.  What is a selling point for me is that even in the face of adversity, this movie reminds you that you can believe whatever you want and make it real.  Watching the expressions of the children during the opening night of Peter Pan made me weep.  It was so wonderful to see the hope and joy in their eyes.  As an adult it's easy to get lost in the minutiae of everyday life, but this movie (as does The Diving Bell and the Butterfly) allows us to be as free as we want.  Imagination, memory, and will are all we need, and we can then go to Neverland.
031606792X|5.0|Stephenie Meyer is truly gifted. She speaks directly to my heart. I had given up on fiction - save Nicholas Sparks and JK Rowling I thought good fiction and esp. good Romantic fiction was dead. Bella and Edward ascend to new heights and you enjoy the ride for most of the book - with some major challenges along the way.  Most romances string you out with the same plots and suddenly they passionately love each other in the last 12 pages and everyone lives happily ever after. (I'm selfish, I want more!). Stephenie isn't afraid to describe their happiness and their one-ness and with a style that you could read hours and hours on end - I was breathless to see what happened next.  Thank you Stephenie, I can't wait for Midnight Sun and I hope Breaking Dawn becomes a movies a movie along with the first three!
B001LA3LYU|5.0|Every single song of the CD is replete with Jeff Beck's peerless guitar ingenuity and dynamic, live concert riffs. Nobody can master the fretboard like the inimitable Jeff Beck. Brilliantly psychedelic and sonically explosive instrumentals on this CD include \\"Beck's Bolero\\", \\"Scatterbrain\\", \\"Big Block\\", \\"Brush With The Blues\\" and the exquisite \\"Blast From The East\\". Jeff Beck classics such as \\"Led Boots\\" and \\"Behind The Veil\\" are performed wonderfully much to the audiences delight. Jeff Beck can also summon the most tender and aching guitar tones evidenced by the poignant \\"Cause We've Ended As Lovers\\", \\"Angel (Footsteps)\\" and the incomparable \\"Were Were You\\". The frenetic jazz fusion of \\"Stratus\\" is still another audio treat. Beck's sterling rendition of \\"A Day In The Life\\" is beyond enthralling. I purchased this CD and can attest that every single song is a guitar instrumental treasure to cherish. Page, Clapton, David Gilmour and Brian May have all stated that Jeff Beck is the best living guitarist. Les Paul also revered him.
0930289234|5.0|Okay. It's NOT a comic book.  It's a graphic novel. Had to get that out of the way.<br /><br />But the truth is, it IS a novel, and a really good one at that.  Just because there are pictures doesn't diminish the superior plot or well drawn (get it?) characterizations in \\"Watchmen\\".<br /><br />I'll admit I bought this book out of sheer curiosity, having seen the trailers for the upcoming movie on Rotten Tomatoes, and wondering WHAT THE HELL THAT was all about.  And why was everyone so excited that a movie was coming? AND that their only concern was that the movie couldn't possibly be as good as the novel.  The bloggers all said that \\"Watchmen\\" (the graphic novel) was the best of its genre, and was in fact one of the best novels of our time.  Could such hyperbole POSSIBLY be correct? I had to find out for myself. So I bought the book.<br /><br />Now I'm sorry.  Sorry that I waited 23 years to read the best SciFi and one of the best EVER novels that I have ever laid my greasy little hands on.<br /><br />Not to say it is without flaws.  Mommies, you probably ought to know that Watchmen is bloody, intense, and, well, relentless.  There's nudity and sex. Lots of senseless killing (or is it senseless?- That's kind of the point...) There's a big blue guy who is running around as naked as the day he was born (or is 'synthesized' a better word?).  Maybe 12 year olds ought to find something else to read.<br /><br />And if it's closure you want, you probably ought to be reading Barbara Cartland or something, cause there ain't none here.  Who wins and who loses?  Aside from Richard Nixon, it's kind of hard to say.  The only character who remains true to his ethical code is certifiably insane, after all.<br /><br />But if you want something intelligent, something thought provoking (e.g., if there WERE superheroes, what would comic books be about?), and something downright fun, Watchmen may be for you.  Try to get it before 030609.<br /><br />And don't wait 23 years to read it!

B001FOR5XU|5.0|\\"On those cloudy days, Robert Neville was never sure when sunset came, and sometimes they were in the streets before he could get back...\\"<br /><br />First off, let me start this review by saying: Do not let the god-awful recent cover or the terrible movie adaptation prevent you from reading this story. Really, the only thing that the recent blockbuster movie and this classic piece of literary fiction have in common is the title and the main character's name.<br /><br />Yes, this book rests in the horror section, but don't let that deter you either. Written in 1954, this dystopian novella was and is a literary achievement and beyond brilliant in its allegorical portrayal of the evolution or rather the devolution of society.<br /><br />In the mid 1970's, the aftermath of war brings sandstorms to California and with it a plague. Over the next few years time, the world is cast back into the dark ages, and the entire population is decimated, leaving in its wake legions of vampiric creatures, stalking the night in search of fresh blood. Robert Neville is immune and the only survivor.<br /><br />Now what makes this story so absolutely brilliant is that the focus is not on the creatures but on the psychological drama that unfolds as Robert Neville not only tries to survive but tries desperately to maintain his sanity and his humanity. Robert Neville is not some highly educated scientist with a high-tech lab in his basement. He is an average man, with conflicts and limitations. Page after page, we feel his struggle. We feel the hatred building within him, we feel the loneliness, and we feel the futility. We relive Neville's shattered life through his heart-wrenching reminiscences, and we desperately reach for hope through his interludes of madness. This is an age-old story: Man's search for the Grail. Human need fuels Neville's quest - He needs to know how and why this happened. He spends his days in the library and his nights performing crude experiments. Is the vampire legend real? Is it a virus? Can he stay alive and lucid long enough to find out? Neville is a man obsessed, tormented by the very idea of his own existence. He must hunt them by day and kill every last one of them to stay alive, but in the end, Neville finds that the world has changed around him: a world where he is not the hero but the monster.<br /><br />I can't reveal too much without spoiling the end, but the title of the story has profound significance. Matheson is one of the finest fiction writers of all time and has influenced many other writers including Dean Koontz and Stephen King. Those of us who love the literary aspects of the horror genre will find no fault with his work. I would even put this story up in the ranks with Frankenstein or Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde simply for its profound social commentary. I am Legend is truly the essence of Dark Romanticism with Poe and Lovecraftian elements weaved throughout. The writing is quick and engaging, very up close and personal, subtle, and not graphic. This is after all a character study. Neville's internal struggle is palpable. The depth of emotion is mortally wounding, and the philosophy - terrifying.<br /><br />Other books by Matheson that have had truly spectacular movie adaptations made of them are: Stir of Echoes and What Dreams May Come. Both are favourites of mine. Sad to say that the movie versions - all of them - of I Am Legend just don't even come remotely close to the true essence of the story. If I had to say, 28 Days Later is by far the best and most psychologically accurate in it's adaptation of the work, but with writing this good, who needs a movie.he stay alive and lucid long enough to find out?

B001C08RHA|3.0|I'm a fan of comic book adaptations but i have to say Iron Man just did not do it for me. I felt that nothing new was added to the comic book adaptation genre, not in plot, screen writing or even special effects. It looked to me like it has all been done and seen before. I did not quite understand what all the hype surrounding this movie was about Robert Downey Jr. was not very convincing as a good guy i liked him better when he was selling weapons and couldn't care less about anyone else, his good side felt to me as somewhat forced on him, didn't believe it. Although i love Gwyneth Paltrow i hated this part for her, it was just meaningless and very secondary, any up and coming actress could have done that role. Paltrow should have never agreed to it.<br />All in all i do not think this movie has what it takes to be on the top ten list of best comic book adaptations.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|First off \\"brilliant\\" The television show was so addicting that I was going through a withdrawl waiting for the next disc to come in the mail.  It's like reading your favorite book that you cannot put down!  I highly recommend this season for people who love twists, action, and a little romance.    I give Lost, season one 5 stars!
B001EOQWEO|5.0|Leave it to Pixar to make us fall in love with a trash compactor robot. Wall-E is innocent and adorable, his obedient ways break your heart and instantly draw you in. The movie is exciting and funny, morale of the story is: get off your lazy behinds and take time to smell the roses. And more importantly to love and care for our planet because taking it for granted could lead to devastating results. Animation is riveting. A must have for all!
B000YAA68C|4.0|True romantic's movie. Loved it! Wish the end was different but in all great as we say chick flick.
B000J10EQU|4.0|Superman is by far my favorite superhero and best onscreen adaptation of all the comic book characters. I have been a fan of the original Superman and was quite skeptic of this movie knowing that the great Christopher Reeve will not be Superman, but the movie did justice to the originals. It is visually stunning and has everything a Superman movie should have. Brandon Routh had an eerie resemblance to Reeve which mad him totally convincing as Superman almost immediately for me. Also Lex Luthor played by Kevin Spacey was genius! This movie is definitely a great addition to the Superman legacy.

One month later I received the video. I am sending it back to Amazon.    I have ordered products from amazon in the past and never had this problem.  I'm afraid to order stuff for Christmas from amazon due to this experience.
1591841992|2.0|When I bought this book I thought it was going to be enlightening. Instead I found this book to be very dry and very boring.    The tone and pace of the book is all wrong. The explanations are too drawn out. I believe 20-30% of the book could be culled out and it would not lose any of its value.    In the end the biggest problem is how hard it is to take something away from this book. I want to feel like I learned something and I don't feel that way with this book.
0393327655|3.0|The End of Faith is one of a growing number of books that are taking effective counter-punches against religion based lunacy in the world. In this erratically researched book, Sam Harris is at his best when he is revealing underknown facts about the brutal, dehumanizing, and devastating effects that organized religion, particularly the people of Abraham (Jews, Christians, Muslims)have often had on the human pursuits of life, liberty, happiness, and knowledge.  Though Dawkins, Hitchens, and others are doing their best to bring inquiring minds up to speed fast, there is no doubt whatsoever that the general public is underinformed about the detrimental aspects of organized religion, and vastly overinformed about highly doubtful benefits of same.  No intelligent discourse about the future role of religion in human life can be held when there has been such a whoppingly lopsided bias towards faith as a basis of government and policy; Harris' book goes a long way towards allowing informed debate to take place.<br /><br />That said, this is an oddly incoherent book.  It starts out detailing the abuses of the Inquisition (impressive!), moves towards an emotionally charged, less well researched, and (I suspect) fear-based editorializing about the Great Satan of all religions (from Harris' point of view):  the Muslim faith.  Harris' discussion of Islam veers from descriptive to invective, and never lets up.  Though he mentions a few Islamic apologists, he does so in the same way that Dr. Evil, in the Austin Powers movies, talks to his teenage son Scott:  Zip it! Zip it! Zip it!.<br /><br />Harris' discussion about terrorism is right at the level of luminaries like Rush Limbaugh, Donald Rumsfeld, and our esteemed George Bush, taking an analytical line that I would call sneer, fear, and smear.<br /><br />Finally, Harris veers into an inconsistently informed discussion of what constitutes consciousness in humans, and attempts to resurrect a type of spirituality that lauds meditation and the loss of the concept of self. Whatever sense of peace his new spirituality gives him, it doesn't prevent Harris from routinely exploding into lizard brain rage on the topic of Islam.<br /><br />My own take is that the book took a swing and a miss at what impedes human progress.  Blindly held beliefs, be they religious or otherwise, result in human catastrophe.  The largest human killings in history were perpetrated by secular leaders (Stalin's 10 million deaths, Mao Zedong's 80 million deaths, Pol Pots Killing Fields).  Harris' disingenuous response to these facts simply overlooks the fact that DOGMA, uncritically held and revered, religious or secular, results in horrendous grief for this barely sane human race.<br /><br />The overall effect of wading through The End of Faith, a book that is more a collection of essays than a coherent approach to a topic, is like eating a delicious bread pudding and repeatedly encountering jarring bits of walnut shells or olive pits.  It has definite nutritional value, but take care not to choke or break a tooth on the junk in the mix.<br /><br />Finally, get the paperback version, Harris has included a very valuable update to FAQ's and challenges regarding the hardcover edition.the concept of self.

B001GKJ2E8|4.0|Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) lives a pathetic life.  He just goes through the motions of each day to get to the next.  That is until fate pairs him with the sexy yet deadly assassin Fox (Angelina Jolie).  Wesley soon learns that he is the son of a professional hit man and that he shares his father's superb killing abilities.  He then believes that it is his destiny to become a member of the Fraternity, a thousand year old society of assassins.  But, Wesley may have gotten more than he \\"Wanted\\" out of the deal.    In order to fully enjoy \\"Wanted\\" you must suspend disbelief as many of the action scenes will leave you saying \\"that's not possible.\\"  But, that's why it's a movie.  It doesn't need to be realistic in order to entertain.  In fact the sheer impossibilities of the action sequences in \\"Wanted\\" is the majority of the fun.  The action is extreme and is like a constant adrenaline rush.  If you thought \\"The Matrix\\" broke new ground, \\"Wanted\\" takes it to another level.  The display of visuals from slow motion to fast and vice versa, and the close ups of bullets entering and exiting their victims,  is absolutely mesmerizing.    \\"Wanted\\" is a thoroughly entertaining action film.  It has so much working for it that makes it worth watching, that after it's over you'll be wanting more.  Get a hold of it.
B001GAOY5U|5.0|By far Journey to the Center of the Earth (2-D and Limited-Edition 3-D) has the best 3D experience I have had in comparison to the limited selection of 3D titles available. This movie is a must see, pure family enjoyment and yes I was thankful that 4 3D glasses were packaged with the Bluray disc, no one felt left out and we all enjoyed the movie immensely.
B000E1MTZE|5.0|Just as I expected ... the Matrix on HD is like seeing the movie, not only for the first time...but in a whole new light.
B00009NH5W|5.0|This album is further proof that TTD (I'm not calling him Sananda) is one of the best songwriters/musicians of our time.  I've been with him since Hardline (though I primarily listen to hardcore metal) and think this is by far his best work.  His voice is better than it's ever been (and that's saying A LOT).  I prefer his softer, slower work that really showcases his vocal ability as opposed to the distorted/processed songs like on Vibrator.  This album is the exact opposite of Vibrator.  My favorites are \\"O Divina\\" which is beyond infectious, \\"What shall I do\\" which is breathtakingly sweet and sincere, \\"Shalom\\", \\"Girl\\", which couldn't be any more smooth, \\"Sweetness\\", and \\"Some Birds\\".  \\"Goodbye Diane\\" is the only faster/harder song that I REALLY like (though everything on this album is great)  If for whatever strange reason this album cost $100 it would be worth it.....it's that good.  This thing is on a whole different level.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|Wall-E is wonderful.  Amazing story line, little words are needed to get the message across.  Companionship, being resourceful, environmentally conscious, having hope to be something better than where we came from.  Everyone should see this movie at least once, even if you aren't big on anime.  Its in the level and up there with Spirited Away and Cowboy Bebop.
B000068FY0|5.0|This album, along with \\"Even in the Quietest Moments...\\" is simply amazing. The song order is brilliant, and I could listen to the title track over and over (I have it playing as I write this!) Supertramp has always had some of the best instrumental segments in many of their songs, so multilayered and pleasing to the ear. My favorites, along with the title track, are \\"If Everyone Was Listening,\\" \\"School,\\" and \\"Bloody Well Right.\\" A bloody good album indeed.

B001C46P2A|5.0|Australia is the followup to Moulin Rouge but bigger antecedecents lie behind it, Gone with the Wind, Titanic, Doctor Zhivago, Reds, big pictures told on a national scale.  In fact I wonder what Australians make of Australia, which seems to involve just one patch of the continent (the Northern Territory), when you would think it would be possible to involve all the Australian states?  Anyhow the story is pretty vast as is, and basically it's held together by a pretty tough racialized storyline involving the \\"stolen generations,\\" aboriginal children claimed by the state and brought up in orphanages away from their families.<br /><br />The story is told largely from the point of view of Nullah, son of an Aboriginal mother and a white dad, and therefore left feeling that he belongs nowhere.  Watched over from afar by his grandfather, little Nullah has a vague, pagan sense of cause and effect; for an American speaker his imagery of singing and fate and a violent liberty seems intoxicatingly difficult and offkilter, and maybe this soupcon of the unknown (even the \\"exotic\\" if you will) gives the otherwise stock romantic plot between Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman a new dimension.  After all, one can no longer believe that the romantic trials of a drover and an aristocratic Mrs. Boss should take central stage when so much else is going on in the world--so much injustice and so much bigoted cruelty.<br /><br />Kidman's character arc as Lady Sarah Ashley is like something out of an 80s'Goldie Hawn movie--pampered princess learns about life as it's lived in the dirt--but I suppose it was Scarlett O'Hara's too, tearing into the earth for a single turnip and swearing never to go hungry again.  Meanwhile a parade of Australia's top actors, including Jack Thompson, Bryan Brown, David Wenham, and even David Gulpilil (from Walkabout, The Last Wave, Rabbit-Proof Fence and Crocodile Dundee) take minor and major roles, so the movie also has some of the fun factor of George Stevens' Greatest Story Ever Told, with John Wayne as the Centurion.  There isn't one thing about Australia I didn't love--except for the horrid Elton John song that plays over the final credits.  Why, Baz, why, was this some secret gay tradeoff?  Outside of that gaffe, I spent the last hour and a half of the movie in tears, it was like the heavens opened and rained on my face, and I can barely remember a time when I did not live in Darwin and squadrons of highly trained Japanese pilots were not pouring down colorful bombs and destroying every evil person in town and breaking the prisons wide open.<br /><br />There weren't too many people in the theater when I saw Australia and I hope this isn't a sign of the movie not doing well.  It has had some totally unfair reviews.  Then I recall that the third, fourth, sixth, seventh and eighth times I saw Moulin Rouge the theater wasn't all that packed either.<br /><br />Those reviews made me think, going in, that I wouldn't be enjoying the film, and I can report that this was not the case.  It was fantastic and beautiful and wonderfully done.  OK, it's not for everyone.  But for me, it was the movie of the year and I only wish that Elton had just said, no thanks Baz Luhrmann.r Told, with John Wayne as the Centurion.

B001CN2WXM|5.0|I remember the first time I saw LA Confidential in the theater. It was at a matinee. Usually, matinee crowds are noisy, but you could hear a pin drop except for two moments in the film when everyone gasped in shock. I have watched it on videotape and DVD, and each time it's like watching it for the first time. It is truly an ensemble piece with not one performance out of place. And it is one of the tightest bit of direction and writing I have ever seen because if you blink you miss important details. The acting, directing, writing, cinematography, and music are top notch. And being from Los Angeles, I thought it captured the feel of the city in the 50's and the lighting of the city. It is \\"LA Film Noir\\" and \\"Cop Film Noir\\" at its finest.    This 2-Disc Special Edition DVD was a surprise with not only extras from the previous DVD, but also recent interviews with some of the cast and crew, an interactive tour map of LA locations used in the movie, and the Music-Only Track of Jerry Goldsmith's score. This edition was truly worth it.
B001GKJ2FC|4.0|This movie makes up its own set of rules and generally follows them, and super-assassins have the ability to do amazing things, including curving bullets.  Wesley Gibson is living a stereotypical uneventful life, working everyday in a cubicle.  One day, he's targeted for assassination and along comes Fox (Angelina Jolie) to save the day.  From here, he learns how to become a superhuman, basically, able to react at rates far beyond the norm.  While the story is ridiculous, it remains interesting throughout.  The movie features a strong cast, including James McAvoy, Angelina Jolie, Common, Terrence Stamp, and Morgan Freeman.    The Blu-Ray features a beautiful transfer.  It really shows off the city of Chicago, as well as the other sets.  The audio is excellent as well.    The extras aren't bad.  There's an extended scene that is unfortunately not in HD.  I never understand why they do this, but they do.  There's also a few behind-the-scenes featurettes that are fairly standard on movies like this, but do show how they filmed things like flipping cars.
006082543X|4.0|1.  This is not the novel.  This is a comic book adaptation of the novel.  That said, it's very well done, but you need to know what you're getting.    2.  I have some issues with it.  It's mentioned several pages in, that it's a very cold summer and that Coraline has to bundle up, but she's drawn wearing T-shirts and short shorts and flip flops.      3.  Second issue.  Coraline also takes \\"the key\\" with her to the other side, but the Other Mother sends a rat to get \\"the key\\" from Coraline's apartment.  Then the Other Mother locks the door.  It's mentioned that there is only one key.  That confused me.  Plus, Coraline eventually uses her own key to escape.  I'm not sure if this discrepancy is in the original novel or just in this comic book version.
B0016Q2D5M|3.0|Firstly, I did not watch this in 3-d which might have improved my rating from a three star to a possible three and a half star.  Brenden Frasier lacks some of his charm in this movie; the lines seemed to be flatly delivered.  His co stars are okay, not exactly memorable but not how-did-they-get-the-part bad.  What I did find enjoyable was the basic story of getting lost in the depths of the earth, finding all kinds of weird things there and the struggle to escape. I particularly liked the crazy flying fish scene and imagine that it would have been cool to watch in 3-D. The dialogue is lacking but the thrills make up for it.

My 10 year old son now has his eye on the LT because one of his friends at school was talking about it. Both boys are talking about Greek mythology to eachother and a teacher has started reading Greek myths aloud in the classroom because of the sudden interest.
B0011Z3334|4.0|I bought and actually like this album. Its catchy- its got lots of good lyrics and a decent band! At first I was skeptical but I listened to the album several times and I like it! If they keep on the Misery Business, Crush Crush track they will be a great band. The rest of the songs are great- its just those 2 stick out.
B00008G9JM|5.0|\\"A Passion Play\\" can be loved or hated. I happen to love it. It is basically a \\"one\\" song album with a break in the middle. Full of amazing rythym changes and melodies within melodies. I would bet that every instrument within eyesight was used on this album. It took a few years to know this album intimately. When I got comfortable knowing where the musical changes were going I could relax and... take this awe inspiring 40 something minute epic in. Simply put, it is one of rock great triumphs. Not because it IS an epic but because once the listener get's this into perspective the treats and jewels whiz by at the speed of sound. Catch them if you can. Highly recommended
1592332803|5.0|Really great book filed with easy recipes. I am very pleased with this purchase and has turned into the cookbook I used most. It provides a great deal of information about what can be used as different substitutes. Also all the recipes are simple and made with things you are likely to already have in your home. I have never had to go on an \\"easter egg\\" hunt to find some bazaar ingredient.
B000SO7OMA|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my teenaged grandaughter, who is a vocalist and also plays guitar in a band. This is an introduction to Loreena McKennitt's music and it will be a journey for my grandaughter. I know she will also love this DVD.
0312370849|4.0|I thought the book was amazing! While I do agree that once all of Sarah's storyline came out, the book was a little easier to put down (not as gripping) I still found it compelling and great.  A must read!

B001M5U5NY|5.0|This is Dan Browns' first novel so don't compare this to DaVinci Code. I like the thriller and suspense with a strong female lead. I'm just very happy to have it on my Kindel. I have all four novels downloaded.    I highly recommend this book for a good read.
B0018CAAN6|5.0|I have to say that this is her best album.  I find so many of these songs to be top notch.  And I give her a lot of credit for exploring so-called \\"hip-hop\\".  She clearly takes it to another level.  I'm not a huge fan, by any means, but I think that in the final analysis, this is a much better record than \\"Music\\", \\"Confessions\\" or \\"Ray of Light.\\"
B001G7SS96|1.0|How do you give the 'ultimate collector's' treatment to an 'ok' sci-fi flick. There's no big fan following for this film. It's easily the worst adaptation of the I AM LEGEND story. Last Man On Earth is the best one and even Omega Man is more fun to watch. If you're going to go collector's on this, why not tie into it the short brilliant story by Matheson...perhaps print a small version of the story as a booklet, detail the parts where the writers took from the novel, where they strayed off. Include Last Man on Earth and Omega Man as discs into the set...make it a collector's tribute to the I Am Legend story. This movie alone is just an 'ok' sci-fi flick...nothing profound or cultish about it. And in this era of great special effects, the creatures were no better than video game quality (and even sub par from that at times). You can clearly see that the creatures and Will Smith did not occupy the same space on screen. I'd only get an ultimate set of this if you include the short novel, Last Man on Earth and Omega Man...the creature designs by comic legend Ron Garney AND the comic adaptation by Steve Niles as well...then you'd have an ultimate I Am Legend Set. Get on that asap.
037582913X|3.0|I recently read The Monster at the End of This Book, by Lovable Furry Old Grover. I picked it up on a lark, figuring it would by a typical horror/thriller throwaway. It followed a pretty obvious course through the old cliches of the genre most of the way through, but the ending threw me for a shock that had me catatonic in existential malaise for weeks afterwards.    NOTE: DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU DO NOT WANT IT TO BE SPOILED!!!        When I found out that the monster in the book was indeed Grover I thought, \\"My god... it could be any of us.\\" Yes that's right, the narrator of the book, the kindly and gentle guide through this thrill-ride, was indeed the monster of which he spoke.     This raised many, many questions. It seems from reflection that Grover himself was unaware that he was the monster. However, in the modern and postmodern likelihood of unreliable narration, it seems that it could just of easily been a clever deception by the monster, to lure the reader into his confidence before springing his trap. But the question remains. Does a monster know he is a monster? Or does his twisted logic somehow rationalize his monstrosity and allow it run rampant? Also, if this physically harmless appearance could harbor the monster of the book, doesn't that mean that anyone could be a monster? That \\"evil has no face\\" as they say?    Ultimately, it brought me to reflect that one may be a monster and not even be full conscious of the fact. That one may be revealed to be monstrous, but only at the end of a mysterious and terrible life of lies.
B001ED7C5I|5.0|It is seldom I purchase a CD and immediatley LOVE everything on it.  Tracy Chapman's Our Bright Future is truly a rarity.  The music and the lyrics are emotionally intelligent...hard to find these days.  If she was not already one of my favorite artists, she certainly is now.  If you like Tracy Chapman, you will love this CD.  If you have never heard her but like soulful, thought provoking music with a purpose, this CD is for you.
031606792X|1.0|I read all four of the books in this series (I categorically refuse to call them a saga) this week.  I wanted to like them - I'd heard the phrase \\"move over Harry Potter\\" on numerous occasions; I was actually excited.  I have an open mind when it comes to teen lit.  I don't expect Hemmingway or Hardy; I can overlook certain....holes in writing technique.  But I've read Harlequin romance novels that were better written than this tripe.     I almost don't know where to start with all of the problems with this book.  I sort of enjoyed the first three.  As I said, I'm generous with these kinds of books.  They were a bit short on plot for me to have really become a fan, and the Edward/Bella romance fell way short of believable.  Ms. Meyer never actually explains why they love each other.  The best we get is that Bella intrigues Edward because she smells good and he can't read her mind (!!!???!!!) and Bella loves Edward because he's BEAUTIFUL.  Right.  OK.  I can live with that kind of shallow simplicity.    What I can't live with is that Ms. Meyer suddenly changed all the rules that SHE set up.  I'm supposed to believe that Edward is suddenly capable of FATHERING A CHILD.  He has no blood, he has no heartbeat.  He doesn't even have to breathe, but he has live semen?  You have to be joking.     Next and worst of all is what happens to the characters.  They are barely recognizable in book 4.  Bella is not interesting as a vampire.  Her character is difficult to like to begin with.  The fact that she is clumsy, drives an old truck and plays maid for her father isn't anywhere near enough to make up for the fact that she used Jacob's love as a sort of....painkiller until Edward came back.  Maybe it's just me but I found that dynamic dreadfully cruel and I already disliked her for it.  But as a vampire she is just unbearable.      Frankly, I don't understand why Bella had to be so...infallible.  Ms. Meyer spent chapters describing in detail that new vampires turn into monsters- only to have Bella completely escape such a fate.  In fact, she maintains almost all of her humanly characteristics (well, except her personality.  That most definitely goes by the way-side) after she becomes a vampire.    But Ms. Meyer's worst crime is against Jacob.  His is the only character that I actually genuinely liked.  And in order for everyone to have their happy ending, he imprints on an INFANT for crying out loud?  BELLA'S infant.  Yuck.    Breaking Dawn is poorly written, the plot is nearly non-existent and it completely ruins anything that had been good about the first three in the series.  Save your time - I wish I had.
031606792X|4.0|Okay so here's my spoiler free review.  I went and saw the movie and immediately afterwards, I ran out and bought the first book Twilight.  I'm so glad I did. Meyer's writing is captivating and the book was a page turner.  Less than a week later, I had managed to read all four.  In Breaking Dawn there were twists and turns all the way through. Parts I loved and parts I hated but I hung in there like a faithful fan should. The first three novels thrilled me and touched me in such a way that I almost felt that I could just forgive a disjointed ride through a fourth. I'm already zipping through the first three books again. If the early books have done anything similiar for you, go ahead and commit to the fourth and make your own judgements.       I will tell you as a thirty-something teacher that I want to encourage parents to consider reading it through before you let your pre-teens read it because it is a departure from the first three books in terms of introducing some adult themes and content. In defense of Meyers,  I think she handles these themes with a huge amount of decorum and sensitivity for her teenaged readers. In any case, judge for yourself if it is appropriate for them to read or if it may require some discussion. Sorry, that's just the high school teacher in me.
B0009A40ES|5.0|Because I enjoy Christian Bale's work very much, I was anxious to see this film. It is admittedly violent and edgy, but if you focus on the nuances that make up an actor's craft, you will see this young man is extraordinarily talented. He worked very hard to get this role and is ideally cast in the film. I can also recommend 3:10 to Yuma if you can concentrate on his underplayed performance and ignore Russell Crowe and his gang. Bale was the believable character.   American Psycho is NOT for the immature viewer, but if you are interested in dissecting characterization and film performance, this is a most worthwhile addition to your collection! - Elisabeth Fuller, Windsor, VA

B0016Q2D5M|5.0|Been a fan of Brendan Fraser for many years, and this movie is Brendan at his greatest. His deliverance of the one liners I laughed so much!  I've never seen a movie were Brendan made me cry, in one section of this movie, He brought tears to my eyes. It's a must watch for all Fraser fans.<br /><br />It's a fun film for all ages Fraser fans or not.<br /><br />This product comes with both 3D and normal picture which was a bonus,<br />I saw the movie 3D at the cinema  and was so looking forward in getting it home, the only thing that I must say I HATED the glsses that came with the movie, I wish it came with the glases that we wore at the cinema. The 3d effects still work but I feel the clour is all wrong.

B001JOIEZ4|5.0|For a pop album is great, but if you really love soundtracks buy the score, is much better.    I don't said the soundtrack is not good, I really like it, but had the sense it's not a soundtrack, the only one is Bella's Lullaby and is part of the score too.     So my final coment is that is a great compilation of pop song that goes wonderfull with the movie.
B001GQACGO|5.0|I can't really put my finger on why this record is so good..    I think it shows that there is more under the hood -- that she's not just a pretty face... I am completely down with this whole thing about changing your name- -like the way Eminem is also Marshall Mathers... and how Garth Brooks is also Chris Gaines...    Oh.. what would be really kewl is if Beyonce calls herself Shelia Surrender on the next record.. that would be kewl.. just keep changing her name each album...  (You have to hear the CalPOP Best Record in the World album to know what I'm talking about)

B001F0VHEM|4.0|It's really too bad record labels don't actually listen to the artists opinions in the mainstream nowadays. Songwriter this, producer that, marketing execs all over the place! Most new acts don't even have the advantage of crafting what THEY want to, even if they do want to, and if they don't they can slink along with formulated garbage & still sell a couple million records. But for every one of those artists, we have true talent in the pop world. Yes, it's hard to find, but it comes around once every year or two & it's name is P!nk.<br /><br />Throughout her decade-long career, this lady has went from something worse than a gimmick - a bad gimmick - on her first album, to a complete turnaround with her second & corresponding albums. From the moment she yelled \\"Get the Party Started\\" on her sophomore effort, you knew she was going to do it her way, and her way is indeed the way pop music should be done.<br /><br />P!nk scored some points critically with her third release, Try This, but failed to make an impact commercially. Such is alwasy true with great music: it gets ignored 99% of the time on the radio waves. The follow-up, I'm Not Dead, rejuvenated her career in a way, becoming a sort of crossroads between her artistic ability & her mainstream propularity. And oh yeah, in the midst of it all she got married...and now she's divorced. Thus we have the latest offering from P!nk, the \\"breakup record\\" atrociously titled Funhouse.<br /><br />This brings me back to the first sentence of this review: it's too bad the labels don't listen. P!nk originally wanted to title this project a much different way. That title, Heartbreak is a M*********er, oddly enough would've described the album PERFECTLY. Instead the label didn't want controversy, so the very misleading Funhouse takes it place. Let me be clear here, people, this is not a \\"fun\\" album. It has it's moments, but there is more heartbreak than good times, and more reality than fantasy. Whatever label exec made the decision to rename this disc NEEDS TO BE FIRED IMMEDIATELY!<br /><br />But back to the album: what a platter of emotions this is! If it weren't such a bold statement, I'd compare it to another powerful female record, Alanis Morisette's multi-platinum Jagged Little Pill. Except this one is 80% less anger-driven, and has more a sense of loneliness & confusion than the confidence displayed in Alanis' work.<br /><br />Yet everyone whose anyone listening to FM radio heard \\"So What\\", the braggadocious breakup jam & lead single off this set, and thought of how \\"fun\\" this \\"house\\" could be. Skip to tracks 2, 3, 4, & 5...you'll be realizing the truth of the matter. P!nk is obviously heartbroken, but desn't quite know where to place her feelings. Is she resentful or is she glad it's over? Is she lonely & depressed or bustin' out her \\"rock moves\\" at the nearest bar? The truly fun part of this album is that you never quite get the answer to any of these questions. She knows she contradicts herself, and quite frankly, she doesn't give a damn.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong, I think this album is excellent, I just think the portrait of what the label & most media outlets would have you believe is not the portrait of what this album really is about. There is a bit more fun, in the form of \\"Bad Influence,\\" the awesome decleration of P!nk's love for parties, and the funky title track, in which she declares \\"this used to be a fun house / but now it's full of evil clowns\\". She even declares to \\"burn the ****er down\\" when referring to her \\"funhouse\\" on the same cut. So regardless of it being upbeat or not, P!nk can't help but to throw some bitter reality into even the breeziest pop tune. At least this time around, anyway.<br /><br />Bringing us back to the original title, that's really the gist of the whole LP: heartbreak IS a **********er, and this girl's obviously had her fill of it. Only about 2 or 3 songs on this set are about topics other than breakups & rocky relationships, but that can be forgiven when you look at how entertaining the overall package is. The lyrics are meaningful, the melodies are either very catchy or sometimes haunting (ex: \\"Crystal Ball\\"), and you come out feeling exactly how P!nk wanted you to in the end. Just as in touch with the sobering realities of life & love as you could possibly be.overall package is.

1416594884|3.0|John Le Carre's A Most Wanted Man begins strong by introducing us to a multi-faceted and realistic description of Melik and his mother's life as Turkish immigrants in a post 9/11 Europe. And complicating this precarious situation is Issa, a Chechen stowaway who forces himself into their lives, leading to unwanted complications. The novel then introduces us to the other main protagonists, Annabel Richter, a human rights lawyer for a non-governmental organization and Tommy Brue, an English private banker. They get involved with Issa, and eventually the heads of British, German and American intelligence services since their mutual client (Issa) is a suspected terrorist.     Essentially, the novel depicts the machinations of the different intelligence services in the war against terror and the mostly undesirable repercussions of their policies among bystanders and innocents. It is an interesting read by itself, given the depth and insightful descriptions of Brue's and Richter's motivations and doubts, but since it comes with the marque of John Le Carre, the reader is expecting more. What we get is a fairly humdrum, ordinary snapshot of what happens to ants when elephants dance, with a lot of repetitive descriptions of the characters inner musings and flaws.     A Most Wanted Man is a novel of contradictions. It's a profound character study but the plot is quite shallow. It's short but it tends to be drawn out. It begins strong and ends weakly. It is a novel by a master but comes off like a novice.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|Another year, another Idol competition...and now another debut album! As of the last two seasons of America's favorite talent show, many critics are doubting the starpower of the actual winner. Ever since Daughtry broke the mold, outselling everyone in not only his Season 5 alumni, but almost every other Idol period, the top spot isn't as important to some as it used to be.<br /><br />I'd call those people cynics, because if you look at the numbers, it breaks down like this: every Idol winner has had a successful career at least up to their first album. That is except for Taylor Hicks' dead-on-arrival career. Some have done much better than others (Underwood, Clarkson) but Ruben Studdard, Fantasia Barrino & Jordin Sparks still racked up a good bit of success with their respective first albums.<br /><br />All of that aside, maybe the real problem with Idol winners is not their commercial success, but rather the quality of their music. Has their ever been a flawless debut from a winner? Of course not. Those kind of pressures are probably what make artists over formulate their projects (ex: Sparks' debut) or completely rebel against the norms & ruin their career in the process (ex: Clarkson's last offering). No matter what the trials & tribulations of Idol debuts, the bar was set ridiculously high for this year's champ: David Cook.<br /><br />So how could a soft rocker, whose specialty on the show was reworking pop classics into modern rock material, craft a great album? With the help of Rob Cavallo, of course! One of the greatest producer's of modern rock helped Mr. Cook morph his thoughts & feelings into this 13-track masterpiece. And no, that was NOT as typo, I did call this a MASTERPIECE.<br /><br />What this guy has, that none of the other Idol singers had this season, is the complete package. Great vocal ability, a likeable personality & probably the most brains of any Idol contestant ever. He could've released an album full of pop covers, like his emo take of \\"Hello\\" by Lionel Richie, and did just as well. Instead he put some real effort into it, and we got something more than just another Idol record. This is a mix of active rock, stunning ballads & some great instrumentation throughout.<br /><br />The powerful opener, \\"Decleration,\\" sets the stage for what this album is like. Very, very, VERY catchy hooks & lyrics you can actually relate to (espicially in a jam like \\"Daily Anthem\\"). If the first couple tracks don't catch your ear, Cook's explosive vocals on the Soundgarden-esque \\"Light On\\" or the all-out rocker \\"Bar-ba-sol\\" are sure to do the trick. Even the mid-tempo's (\\"Life on the Moon\\", \\"Mr. Sensitive\\", \\"Come Back To Me\\", \\"I Did It For You\\", etc) have such compelling hooks they can't be ignored. By the time you get to the album's two best offerings, the winning Idol tune & Adult Contemperary hit \\"Time of My Life\\" & the simply astonishing power ballad \\"Permanent\\", it's almost unbelievable that the disc is so good.<br /><br />I'll tell you first hand, from someone who also had high expectations for this project: Cook did an amazing job, and there is nothing bad to say about this album. A minor technical glitch comes in the form of a 10-minute space between \\"A Daily Anthem\\" & \\"Kiss on the Neck\\", which should have been seperated into two tracks, but that is barely worth mentioning. Even if there were 10 minute breaks in-between every track, I'd still listen through them for such great material.<br /><br />Only time will tell if David Cook will have the kind of commercial success previous Idol winner's have, or if he will fall into obscurity as some have also done. No matter what, though, his music is \\"permanent\\"; it's what we should really remember...and dammit this is one album that'll be hard to forget.just as well.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|Turn the dial back to 1991 for a minute. That's the year Metallica's hit \\"Enter Sandman\\" and Nirvana's \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" both stormed on to the charts.     It was a turning point for rock music.     The former track marked the high point of popularity for a band that had dominated the metal scene for much of the previous decade with epic albums shot through with equal measure of dark lyrics and face-melting musicianship.     The latter song defined a just-budding decade and launched a million garage bands who hoped that a surplus of angst and flannel would make up for their meager repertoire of guitar chords.    Within one year, Cobain's catchy hooks and stripped-down act seemed to make the brooding extravagance of Metallica and other metal bands irrelevant.     The rest of the decade saw Metallica struggle to define itself and its direction. Although \\"St. Anger\\" was released in 2003, the album shared more in common with its lackluster predecessors from the 90s, \\"Load\\" and \\"Reload\\". The musical malaise of the 90s had carried over into the new millennium.    Fast forward to 2008. \\"Death Magnetic\\" hits shelves in September and the cosmos are set right again.    Under the mystic direction of production druid Rick Rubin, the band has crafted 10 songs that harken back to their glory days, when fans threw the horns to epic tracks like \\"And Justic For All\\", \\"Master of Puppets\\" and \\"Blackened\\".    This is also one of those rare cases of an album not having any bad songs. None. Even \\"Unforgiven III\\", dismissed by many critics as \\"unnecessary\\", would more than hold its own as a standout hit track on a lesser album.    There are, of course, genuine standouts, starting with the opening trio of songs -- \\"That Was Just Your Life\\", \\"The End of the Line\\" and \\"Broken, Beat and Scarred\\" -- that form an intro that must surely rank as one of the best ever.    Other tracks of note include \\"The Day That Never Comes\\", \\"All Nightmare Long\\", \\"Cyanide\\" and \\"Judas Kiss\\".    It's clearthat Rubin succeeded in drawing out the best in each band member. Singer/guitarist James Hetfield's urgent snarl is in full force; Kirk Hammett's intricate noodling proves he's still one of the finest lead guitarists out there; Lars Ulrich's dual bass drums are like twin howitzers blasting away at your eardrums; and Robert Trujillo proves his mettle by serving up meaty basslines that bind the songs like steel bands.    One of my favorite one-sentence summaries of the album was given by a DJ on Seattle's KISW: \\"It's an album that punches you in the face repeatedly, and I mean that in a good way.\\"    This is an amazing album that instantly revives old-school Metallica and proves Tenacious D's memorable adage: You can't kill the metal!
B0011UBDTK|4.0|If you're reading this review, you probably already love the series. And having it on DVD is great - especially compared to watching the watered-down version on broadcast TV.    My only complaint is how grainy the images are, at least through the first season or two. I know this is probably how it was shot, and not the fault of the DVDs, but it is still annoying. Not enough to not recommend the discs, but be aware of this before you buy.

0061122416|5.0|A friend of mine at work began telling me about Paulo Coehlo's book, \\"The Alchemist,\\" and the next thing that I knew, he loaned it to me to read over this past Thanksgiving weekend.    I love adventure/inspiration books like Jonathan Livingston Seagull, so I devoured the book quickly, with tears in my eyes in several places as I journeyed with Santiago in my own mind.    The parable is compelling: Santiago's growth from a boy into a man, understated by the author, complemented the change of scenery from meadow, to town, to oasis, desert and back home again.

0007144369|5.0|Oscar Wilde is a master and writing is his art. His works--and indeed words--contain the many shades of humor, poetry, psychology and philosophy. He has a tongue-in-cheek way of narrating stories, usually keeping the reader on their toes (except when they're rolling on the floor laughing) but never alarming or abandoning them and never for a moment causing them to wish to put the book down. He is a legend, and his works are undeniably classics.    In this one book is contained all his life's works: prose, poetry and even essays. However long or short, all his writings are really fun to read. He has a way with words--his signature style, if you will--that not even a handful of other authors in this world can mimic. In that regard, he is second to none. The book also features several (black and white) photographs of Oscar Wilde as a bonus.     I highly and wholeheartedly recommend this book for every library and every fan of classic literature. I also suggest you buy the hardcover version of this book for just a couple bucks more if you're worried about wear and tear.

B0015RDGD0|3.0|Overall I give this animation/movie the following scores:<br /><br />Animation  A+/Blu-ray B-/Video On Demand<br />Writing  C-<br />Acting  C<br />Story  B<br /><br />The movie honestly is a pleasure to watch, but please note that to get the best effect you should purchase the Blu-Ray version, otherwise the score goes from A+ to about a B- since it stacks up against any average animation.  My first mistake was getting it via \\"Video On Demand\\" and what a terrible mistake that was.  Watching it in HD made all the difference.<br /><br />However, the writing and acting was very disappointing as it reminded me of some of the things I used to read from my friends in Junior High School.  It's really at that level in my opinion.  It all felt very forced and bland in that respect.  But, then again, the HD continued to captivate me especially since I enjoy anime.
B000KSAZ8Y|4.0|The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie - what a treat. Miss Jean Brodie teaches at the Marcia Blaine School for Girls in Edinburgh. Miss Brodie is in her \\"prime\\". And as such all who know her during her prime should feel in some way privileged.<br /><br />Miss Brodie has selected a number of girls whose parents are either uninvolved, too dumb to notice or liberal and enlightened to be \\"her girls\\". The Brodie set as they are known are given special attention by Miss Brodie. In the course of their relationship the girls begin to come into one's own - of course under the approval of Miss Jean Brodie. She doesn't make the girls do things necessarily, but she discusses what she likes and what she doesn't and what is becoming and what is not, and the difference between little girls and a woman in her prime.<br /><br />The girls are rather devoted to Miss Brodie even though at times she comes across as quite ridiculous. Miss Brodie has also attracted the attention of two male teachers at the school. One of whom she is most ardently in love with, the other is simply fulfiling a need. The man she loves is married and she stays away, but never too far. The man she doesn't love she keeps at the end of a rope about arms length away.<br /><br />The headmistress has been trying to sack Miss Brodie ever since Miss McKay came to Marcia Blaine. And she goes after Miss Brodie through the girls.<br /><br />At some point Miss Brodie is betrayed (you do find this out rather early in the book). What I can never figure out is do I like Miss Brodie, is she ridiculous, is she a good influence, a bad influence, is she too be pitied. She's very hard not to like.
0920668372|1.0|I don't know what makes people think this is such a wonderful book. It's really *weird*. The mother creeps along the floor of her sons room at night to crawl into bed with him. Then, when he leaves the house as an adult, she drives across town with a ladder, and climbs up into his bedroom window at night while he's sleeping. It's CREEPY. Don't buy this book thinking it's \\"all nice and stuff\\". It's not, it's downright weird.
B001EYGOEM|1.0|Taylor Swift may be a sweet girl.  She looked sweet at the Country Music Awards a few days ago, but she can't sing.  She needs a vocal coach in the worst way.  I suffered through the program hoping to hear Sugarland before it was over.  J. Nettles can sing.  Pickler can't, nor Swift.  Are big blonde hair and big white teeth and tight jeans and boots (oh please, some of the ugliest I've seen) all that matter anymore in Nashville.  And the red carpet preening?  How many layers of lipstick do you reckon Carrie wore throughout? And false eyelashes?  And her last dress made her look like an over-stuffed crow, with all those black feathers blown by the fashion-fan. It was more Hollywood--no, Bollywood-- than Nashville. But I guess that's what so-called country music has become, or so it seemed, until Jennifer, who lets her hair do what it wants and wears practically no make-up.  Face it, girls, a good voice and a good song---that's what it's all about.

B000HBKCDC|5.0|This album is the opposite of the piped-in Muzak at the mall. There's real emotion and feeling here, not a Santa Claus or snowman in sight: these songs focus on the emotional aspects of the holiday. If you love \\"The Little Drummer Boy\\" and \\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\"  type of carols, this might not be for you: too moody and introspective. But if you're looking for Christmas music that isn't the usual background \\"sounds of the season,\\" you might wind up loving this.

That way, I don't have to wait six months.  It's out mid-January 2009. [Rubs hands together!]<br /><br />About the book, what can I say that others haven't:  Stieg Larsson's untimely death at age 50 in 2004 is a tragedy.  His manifest talent fairly explodes on these pages.  Every aspect of his background - financial journalist, crusader of violence against women, fervent exposer of Nazism, a person with a deep understanding of IT and data security - combines on these pages to make a gripping read that you can't put down.  465 pages never went by so fast.
0783225482|4.0|One of the best 'big' special effects comedies of the 1990's...fantastic support from all the main stars make this a cult classic i feel, which didnt do as well as perhaps Zemeckis other work at the box office..still a great, deliciously dark and witty comedy.     Now for the minus star...why has this not been re-released on DVD with a widescreen, HD like transfer, full surround sound and extra features???? Very dissapointing Universal....
B001CC7PP8|5.0|XXXXX<br /><br />Early in this movie the viewer is told that a boy's best friend is his mother.  Is this true??<br /><br />This movie is a suspense/horror/the first psychoanalytic thriller directed by the \\"master of suspense\\" himself, Alfred Hitchcock.  It is based on the novel \\"Psycho\\" by Robert Bloch, which in turn was inspired by the crimes of Wisconsin murderer Ed Gein.<br /><br />Briefly, this film depicts the encounter between secretary Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) who is hiding in a motel after embezzling from her employer, and the motel's owner, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), and the aftermath of their encounter.<br /><br />Look for Hitchcock's traditional cameo that appears early in the story.  (Note that it is difficult to find.)<br /><br />The now famous motel mentioned in the summary above is called the \\"Bates Motel.\\"  It's sign is first seen just over 24 minutes into the movie.  We learn later that business is bad at the Bates' Motel since it has \\"twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.\\"<br /><br />About 28 minutes into the movie, we encounter Norman Bates.  He lives with his mean, emotionally unstable, possessive, invalid mother in a now famous sinister-looking house (dubbed the Bates' Mansion) on top of a hill near the motel.  His hobby: taxidermy (that is, \\"stuffing things.\\").  He also stutters when under pressure.<br /><br />This movie has several scenes that are legendary but perhaps the most famous is the shower scene.  It occurs 46 minutes into the movie.  This unforgettable scene took seven days to film and required about seventy camera set-ups.  It lasts three minutes.<br /><br />The performance given by Anthony Perkins (as Norman Bates) is incredible.  Janet Leigh (as Marion Crane) also gives a decent performance.  In fact, both performances were so good that they both suffered from typecasting after this movie was released.  (Also look for Hitchcock's daughter Patricia and Ted Knight, best known for \\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show,\\" in bit parts.)<br /><br />This movie is open to many interpretations especially psychoanalytic ones.  For example, the Bates' Mansion has three floors paralleling the three levels that psychoanalysis attributes to the human mind:  (1) superego (first floor) (2) ego (ground floor) (3) id (basement).<br /><br />The background music is incredible.  It effectively adds to each scene.<br /><br />This movie had four Academy Award nominations.  It also spawned several sequels and a remake, all of which are generally seen as works of lesser quality.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD itself (the one released Oct. 2008) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has many interesting extras.<br /><br />In conclusion, you have to see this movie to see why it's regarded as one of Hitchcock's best films and highly praised as a work of cinematic art by international critics!!<br /><br />(1960;  1 hr, 50 min;  wide screen;  black and white;  27 scenes; 2 discs)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXXr />This movie is open to many interpretations especially psychoanalytic ones.

B00004RF9B|4.0|In 1956 MGM released Fred Wilcox's Forbidden Planet. Originally conceived as a B-movie the film has taken on a personality and a cult status that brands it as one of the most unique American films made. The film has been the inspiration for Star Wars and Star Trek and just about every modern space opera references it.    The story is not a simple one and a great deal of Cyril Hume's screenplay is exposition that manages to take somewhat complex themes and make them accessible to a Saturday afternoon audience. A space cruiser piloted by Commander J.J. Adams (Leslie Nielsen) lands on the planet Altair 4 and meets the mysterious  Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) and his daughter Altaira ( Anne Francis). Morbius is studying the artifacts of a strange civilization called the Krells. The Krell civilization was incredibily advanced. It had wiped out war, disease and had explored the universe 2000 centuries ago before it was itself wiped out.     The story is a reworking of Shakespeare's The Tempest and the story hold up quite well after 52 years. The special effects were amazing for the time period and the matte paintings used for the backgrounds still look fantastic. The film was nominated for the 1957 Oscar for best special effects.    If there is a problem with Forbidden Planet it is that the story of Monsters of the Id is somewhat dated. The film needs to be seen for the special effects production that it was. It does not need to be analysed for its story telling ability.    The edition I viewed was the single disc  released by Warner Brothers. There have been at least two editions released since mine came out and I understand are much more complete. The picture, while not perfect, is quite good. There are scratches and abundant markings for reel changes and the like but they do not really mar the viewing experience. The sound is a standard mono mix but is easy to understand. The disc does not feature any special features other than the trailer. The trailer features a floating yellow scroll that was duplicated to great effect in the Star Wars movies.    Get yourself some popcorn pop this one in and enjoy the golden age of sci-fi moviemaking.
B000001EG6|5.0|This is it! Perfect from start to finish, from the heard-it-zillions-of-times-and-still-moves-me Your Song to The King Must Die! As a kid I used to wonder how could someone (Bernie Taupin) write such powerful lyrics and hearing the Greatest Discovery again brings me back those teenage memories. Not to be missed! If you are a huge fan you might want to buy the 2-disc special edition. Enjoy it 60 years on!
1439136653|3.0|Ram Mohammad Thomas is a boy from the Indian slums who has entered a \\"Who wants to be a millionaire\\" style television quiz show.  Despite his lack of formal education, his life experiences have perfectly equipped him to answer each question that comes up.  Because the show's organizers are sure that he must have cheated, they ask him to explain how he was able to answer such difficult and obscure questions.  Each chapter deals with another question and answer, and as the book progresses his very colorful life story is also gradually revealed.<br /><br />This is not the most well written book I've read, but the way that the plot unfolds is very clever and keeps the reader's attention throughout.  As each question is revealed, you can't help thinking \\"okay, now how is he going to integrate THIS into Ram's story?\\" and it's fun to see the way that he does, while also advancing the central plot.  Slumdog Millionaire tears along at a quick pace: some parts are very amusing while others are very sad, but Swarup doesn't dwell on either.  The way it all comes together at the end is highly contrived, but does make for a satisfactory conclusion.<br /><br />If you enjoy books about India, there are other books that are more realistic or better written (I especially recommend the wonderful and highly moving novel \\"A Fine Balance\\"), but this is an easy and entertaining story that captures much of the essence of this fascinating country.<br /><br />UPDATED 12/27: I have now seen the film Slumdog Millionaire.  While the film has the taken the central theme and structure of the book, it also has many differences - for starters, the hero's name.  Many plot elements of Ram/Dev's life story are entirely different in the film vs the book.  Essentially the film is a very simplified version and hinges on the romance with Latika, which is not the case in the book.  For me, the film works brilliantly, but it is not a slavish adaptation.  This book is more \\"the book that inspired the film\\" rather than \\"the book of the film\\".f the film\\".
B000W91RUG|5.0|I watched my first episode of The Big Bang Theory on a plane. It was the episode (The Fuzzy Boots Corollary) where Leonard, Sheldon, Wolowitz and Raj were playing a MMORPG (a fitting tribute to World of Warcraft or any similar online game) and they ended up fighting over the Sword of Azeroth, a rare/unique weapon, which ended up on eBay. Within those first few minutes, I was SOLD!<br /><br />The Big Bang Theory chronicles the lives of 3 main characters, i.e. Sheldon Cooper, Leonard Hofstadter and Penny. Sheldon and Leonard are gifted scientists (though Sheldon claims he is way more gifted than Leonard) and housemates. Penny is the lovely blonde who has moved in next door, much to Leonard's delight. However, neither Leonard nor Sheldon have much luck with women and watching Leonard's attempt to win over Penny is comical and hilarious. The 2 other characters (Wolowitz - the horny jew & Raj - the computer pro from India) are also amazing, and complement the main cast very well.<br /><br />I guess what draws many to this series is how easily we can relate to the characters (it shows you that there are way more nerds and geeks out there ;)). The cast are fantastic, particularly Jim Parsons who plays Sheldon. Not only do they fit their roles really well, but after a couple of episodes, you can't help but feel that no other actors would do quite as good a job.<br /><br />This DVD set contains all the 17 episodes from the first series with not many extra features but watching and laughing through each and every episode makes the collection a worthwhile purchase on its own. If you're a geek, a nerd or anyone who just wants a good laugh, this series is for you! :)

B00005JPS8|5.0|This review is not lengthy description of the plot of Iron Man, it is simply written to tell you that this is by far the best Super Hero movie made in a very long time.  I originally thought it was going to be another corny over the top Super Hero theme flick that is entertaining because of the action but leaves you empty.  This movie has decent acting, by far the best Robert Downy Jr. movie I have ever seen and he made me want to watch more.  Gwenyth Paltrow plays a simple yet crucial role and provides an excellent counter part to Downy Jr.    This really is a must see and you will not be disappointed by the pick.  As long as you are looking for a high action entertaining choice, Iron Man is the way to go!
B001BFFTO0|5.0|I bought these boots and I just love them. They are comfortable out of the box, well made, with nice arch support. They are warm, but they allow your feet to breathe. I would not use them as a work boot, but they are great for trudging around the park with the dog. They are also light and very nice looking.<br /><br />I'm very pleased.

The people in the cards are monster like, but most of them are smiling and telling a story. These cards speak to me, some more then others because of the artwork and symbols that are not as complicated as other decks can be. Some people at first glance would think the deck is haunting, but if they looked closer they would see it is a useful tool to explore and strengthen the psychic mind.
B001CTA1RK|3.0|\\"Transporter 3\\" is an action film in every sense. A brain isn't required to watch it, and I have a feeling there wasn't much of a brain at work when making it. Does that make it worth seeing? Not really. I'll be the first to admit that mindless action can be a fun, harmless distraction. Consider this summer's \\"Wanted,\\" a film I recommended not for its story, but for its stylish comic book excess. It was meant to be preposterous. \\"Transporter 3\\" doesn't have the same appeal. It feels forced, contrived, and desperate, as if the filmmakers knew right from the start that they didn't have much to work with. Maybe it's become tiresome to once again watch Jason Statham play the exact same role. Or maybe it's the fact that the plot is paper-thin, awkwardly humorous, and oddly derivative of older James Bond films. It could be any number of things. All I know is that, even for something that's purely escapist, it isn't trying very hard.    There are, however, a few interesting ideas at work. Having moved from Miami back to the South of France, professional Transporter Frank Martin (Statham) has the odds stacked against him when an American assassin named Johnson (Robert Knepper) forces him into moving a package from Marseilles to Odessa. The package: A beautiful, if sulky, Ukrainian woman named Valentina (Natalya Rudakova), the kidnapped daughter of Leonid Vasilev (Jeroen Krabbe), the head of his country's Environmental Protection Agency. In order to ensure compliance from both Frank and Valentina, Johnson has each fitted with a special bracelet that will explode if they step more than seventy-five feet away from Frank's car, an Audi A8 W12. But you know Frank--he doesn't even follow his own rules, let alone rules that are imposed on him. So just imagine all the eye-popping visuals and impossible stunts that are in store for you.    Here are some examples. (1) On a long road in the middle of nowhere, Frank is speeding away from a pursuing car. Up ahead are two slow-moving eighteen-wheelers, which, for reasons known only to the filmmakers, are going in the same direction while occupying both sides of the road. In order to escape, Frank has to go between the trucks. But how can he when the gap is so narrow? Somehow, he manages to tilt his car to one side, balancing it only on the left-side wheels. (2) After driving his car into a lake, Frank uses the air from the tires to inflate large orange balloons, which, of course, returns the car to the surface. After he somehow gets the engine restarted, he drives to a bridge, zooms off, and lands on top of a speeding passenger train, where poor Valentina is in Johnson's evil clutches.    Yes, it's all in the spirit of fun. Even so, something was missing. I couldn't suspend disbelief as easily as I could for films like \\"Wanted.\\" It could be due to the character development, which is not normally associated with mindless action films. Consider Valentina, always moping, always aloof, always thinking about death. Yet at the same time, she yearns for Frank's affection. I think it all began when Frank found himself in hand-to-hand combat with a group of Johnson's thugs in the middle of a mechanic's garage. In that particular moment, Frank's fighting style can essentially be described as an aggressive striptease, his jacket, tie, and shirt removed at one point or another. Needless to say, Valentina liked what she saw. She uses it against him later on after grabbing the car keys, exiting the car, and moving away; she won't give Frank the keys back unless he removes his shirt.    And as for Frank ... well, there really isn't much that can be said. Twice before he's been a monotone, wisecracking, testosterone pumping, seemingly indestructible action hero, and he remains one in this new film. Of course, the fact that he's always so serious and professional doesn't stop him from falling for Valentina, which is hard to understand given the complete lack of chemistry between them. It probably would have been better had writers Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen hadn't made an attempt at character development. Don't expose Valentina's frailty or even her uncanny ability to tell Frank where in Europe to find the best food. And don't have her and Frank fall in love. Love is too deep and meaningful for a man that transports things for a living.    The comedy relief--for lack of a better term--mostly comes from the interactions between Frank and his long-time friend, Inspector Tarconi (Francois Berleand). At the start of the film, they have a spirited debate on whether Jerry Lewis was funnier than Dean Martin. Tarconi, true to his French upbringing, believes Lewis is a comedic genius. Frank takes the opposite approach: \\"Anyone can fall down and get a laugh, but a real genius does it while drinking and smoking.\\" This is, we eventually discover, a parallel to a later observation made by Tarconi about why Russians are always so morose: \\"I remember reading Dostoevsky and thinking, `Don't these people ever laugh?'\\" Maybe they do and maybe they don't. What does it matter? It's an amusing line, although I wonder why there needed to be a sense of humor at all. Who made it a rule that action films had to be funny in order to be entertaining? Normally, all you have to do is give me something good to look at. Unfortunately, for everything \\"Transporter 3\\" could have been as an escapist action film, it just didn't live up to my expectations.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|I've been a fan of Alan Ball since [[ASIN:B000HEVZBW Six Feet Under]], so I had to watch this. I never read the books, but plan on it, knowing it's different from the series a bit, according to other reviewers.<br /><br />This show hasn't been released on DVD yet, and people have been reviewing it since the first episode. I've seen them all, especially the 12th one, and am very excited about what's been going on. Alan Ball has another hit on his hands. I have no doubt that the DVD release will have tons of goodies for fans.<br /><br />My only gripe is with the cliffhanger at the end...why do that? CSI did it (as I'm sure many other shows have), and [[ASIN:B001FA1OTU Deadwood]] did it too (to be fair, Deadwood was cancelled after the 3rd Season, and a shame too!)! You make people crawl the walls in suspence and then leave them hanging there. I'm sorry, Alan. I blame you for this since you wrote & directed the last episode.<br /><br />Overall, though, it's a really great show that adds a new flavor to the vampire world, something I haven't seen before. And it's got a really neat opening theme too!!
1596912863|5.0|I've recently started to read \\"Jane Austen sequels\\" and this is one of the books that kept popping up, along with [[ASIN:0452289726 Confessions of a Jane Austen Addict]].  I read \\"Confessions...\\" first and was greatly disappointed.  Then I picked up this one.<br /><br />As I mentioned in my review of \\"Confessions\\", this isn't exactly a \\"Jane Austen sequel\\" but I'm going to lump it into that category.  The main character in this book goes on a vacation to an estate that essentially mirrors one in Austen's time (thankfully with modern bathrooms though!).  She's obsessed with Mr. Darcy from [[ASIN:1438242816 Pride and Prejudice]], and with Mr. Darcy/Colin Firth from the movie version ([[ASIN:B00005MP58 Pride and Prejudice(A&E, 1996)]].  Who can blame her really?  But the problem is that she's compared all her relationships to the perfect gentleman, which she may never find.<br /><br />I, like many of the other reviewers, am enchanted with the idea of an estate where everyone eacts like ladies and gentlemen in Austen's time.  The problem the main character has is that she can't figure out what is real and what is not.  Who is an actor/actress, and who is simply on vacation like she is?<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book, especially after \\"Confessions...\\".  This book started a bit slow, but once our heroine reaches \\"Austenland\\" (as she calls it), everything starts to pick up.  I was sorry to see this story end, and though I don't expect it, I'd love to see a sequel with others visiting \\"Austenland\\".
B001EIOOV8|5.0|A near flawless film.  Many probably don't agree, but I do place this one, 1 notch above Goodfellas.  Don't get me wrong, Goodfellas is a great film in it's own right, but for me Casino takes the cake.  For a 3 hour film it passes quickly and is wholly entertaining.  One of my favorite aspects is the performances.  I am not a huge Sharon Stone fan, but Martin manages to get a full out dramatic performance out of her, definitely her best role in her entire film career to date.  I can watch this film once a year and never get bored and I always watch from beginning to end.  I believe this is his most underrated mob movies, which is unfortunate, because it is definitely my favorite.

B000QXDED6|5.0|Based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley, 300 takes over the screen like an invading horde. With all the gushing blood of a horror movie and the scope of a classic epic, the second film from Zack Snyder (who helmed the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead) is an impressive visual spectacle. Gerard Butler plays Leonidas, the king of ancient Sparta. The city is famous for its warrior philosophy, and Leonidas won't kneel to the demands of Persia's King Xerxes. Instead, Leonidas leads his 300-strong army against Xerxes's army of millions.<br /><br />With its gore and scale, 300 marks director Snyder as a possible successor to Peter Jackson's throne.  The huge fights in 300 rival Jackson's efforts in the Lord of the Rings films.  Though the cast doesn't boast any A-list stars, the actors ably fill their larger-than-life roles.  Though there are scenes that demonstrate the humanity of the characters, 300 is undeniably about bravery and blood, and it succeeds because of the stylish depictions of both.
0345495004|2.0|I felt the author wanted me to sympathize with Mamah, but I just couldn't. She was completely spoiled and selfish. She wanted to live her life the way she wanted with no consequences for her actions and choices. She CHOSE to marry Edwin, and not as a young, just-out-of-high school girl, but as a woman of 30. By that time she should have had more of an idea of what she wanted from life. Rather than deal with her choice, she abandoned him and her two children.  He had done nothing to her - he wasn't abusive, he didn't mistreat the children. He just wasn't exciting enough for her, nor did he flatter her into thinking she was just so extremely intelligent the way Frank did. Then when she again CHOSE to leave her husband, she complained about the consequence of losing her chidren as a result. Even then, she took no steps to correct the action. Instead, she just whined about missing them. If she missed them that much, she could have gone home.    Frank was just as much, if not more, of a selfish narcissist as she was. With these two as main characters, it was hard to get into the book.  My favorite scene was when her sister told her off. Lizzie, the one who had chosen not to get married because she enjoyed her life the way it was, was practically forced by circumstance to step in when Mamah ran off. Because Mamah wanted the freedom to make her own choices, it in essence robbed everyone else of their choices.    Even at the end, I felt great sympathy for Edwin, but very little for Frank and Mamah. I even felt more sympathy for Gertrude than for the ho and her pimp. That's what Mamah and Frank were to me.
B0014DZ2VO|3.0|\\"Quantum of Solace,\\" the most recent vehicle for perennially stylish MI-6 operative James Bond, is the immediate sequel to the previous film, \\"Casino Royale.\\"  By immediate, I of course mean that the time-span between the end of the last film and the beginning of this one is somewhere around ten minutes.  Director Marc Forster (\\"Finding Neverland\\") opens up the action from the first frame, as Bond (Daniel Craig, \\"Layer Cake\\") powers his Aston Martin down a narrow Italian mountainside road, fleeing those seeking to deprive him of his quarry.  Despite enduring several collisions, a maelstrom of bullets, and the unfortunate loss of his drivers-side door, James overcomes his enemies, and delivers his prize to M (Judi Dench, \\"Notes on a Scandal\\").  Viewers are barely allowed a single breath before the \\"prize,\\" an agent (leader?) of an elusive organization known only as \\"Quantum,\\" proves that even MI-6 is not above infiltration--a double agent posing as M's bodyguard nearly kills her before fleeing the scene, provoking a rooftop chase sequence that'll keep you from blinking for five minutes.<br /><br />From there, Forster keeps up the pace, sending James to England, Haiti, Austria, Italy, Bolivia, and Russia.  He endures gunfire, knives, explosions, betrayal, and the loss of his credit rating with nary a grimace.  Decked out throughout in exquisitely tailored suits--designed to make the fabulous crew on Bravo nod with approval, or your wife glance over at you in disdain--Bond never appears as if he is engaged in anything more stressful than a moderately-challenging game of racquetball.  He evades Quantum agents, a power-mad Bolivian general, MI-6 (which thinks him a rogue agent), and his near-overpowering grief, ever-present since the death of Vesper (Eva Green).  He enlists the aid of former enemies, and finds a spiritual, rather than carnal, connection in the person of Bolivian secret service agent Camille (Olga Kurylenko).<br /><br />The endless debate regarding \\"the true spirit of Bond\\" rages on, but like it or not, Craig is here to stay as 007.  Buff, blond, and brutally effective at opening up universes of hurt upon any opponent, this Bond appears the antithesis of the previous parade of well-manicured, hedonistic incarnations.  Indeed, some detractors of the new protagonist raise fears that the entire franchise has been distilled down to base elements, becoming an ordinary action series.  \\"They\\" state that--without the gadgets, half-coy/half-annoying humor, or absence of real danger or emotional connection in the character of Bond--the last two films are not \\"real\\" Bond films, having lost some ineffable \\"essence\\" present in the original films.  Honestly, to heck with the first twenty-odd movies--their day has come and gone.  Change is good, and it was long-past time to overhaul the slightly effeminate, always well-adjusted, and unfunny quip-maker who never seemed to mind after he trashed yet another beautiful bit of automotive genius.  What kind of man wouldn't weep after destroying a Vanquish?  Let's be real to ourselves here, folks:  the James Bond of yesterday wasn't someone who was very believable.  Craig plays an angry, obsessed, and dangerous man who--unfortunately for his enemies--also possesses the ability to kill via penlight if need be.  Because of, rather than in spite of, these emotions, he seems a bit more human to us in the crowd.<br /><br />Never fear, as there still remain elements which set apart the series and make it recognizable.  James Bond still obtains miraculous invitations to fabulous parties that most likely not one in ten-thousand Amazon customers would ever attend.  His service weapon bears a familiar snub-nosed appearance.  Gorgeous women, muscular cars, free airline tickets, exciting chase sequences, and fantastical plots for world domination by nebulous organizations still make regular appearances.  James Bond is always, always in control of every situation, even if he wasn't aware he was even in a situation.  His many fitted suits have surely resulted in thousands of illegal text messages being sent to the online warehouse of Armani during showtime.  There is enough action to satiate even the most adrenaline-challenged among us.<br /><br />Perhaps unsurprisingly, this is the portion of the review which contains a few \\"and yets.\\"  This movie, and indeed most \\"Bond\\" movies, is most likely superior to the best efforts of other directors--and yet, it is still not a great 007 film.  The plot is a maddeningly paced affair with multiple betrayals, reversals, and feints--and yet, the ultimate scheme of Quantum is still, it pains me to say, rather silly.  The movie continues the intriguing arc set up in the first movie, turning the series into more of a serial--and yet, so few morsels are given up that the filmmakers risk losing the audience's commitment to unraveling the \\"big picture.\\"  The cinematography of Siena, Italy is so fantastically gorgeous that most viewers might seriously consider giving up all of life's pleasures just to contemplate the sheer beauty of the city in the vein of a monk mediating upon a koan--and yet, did James really have to travel to Italy twice?  We race along with Bond as he dodges foe, MI-6, and the CIA--and yet, how many times does the \\"rogue agent on his own\\" story have to be thrust in our faces before it is just boring?<br /><br />I highly recommend giving \\"Casino Royale\\" another viewing prior to seeing this movie, as many prior events and characters are reintroduced.  Ultimately though, \\"Quantum of Solace\\" doesn't add much to the series.  The film gets three stars for a well-shaken but poorly-stirred effort.fitted suits have surely resulted in thousands of illegal text messages being sent to the online warehouse of Armani during showtime.

B001M6KTLG|1.0|Plain and simple, yes, it's really that bad. I thought that maybe I was remembering the originals to be better than they really were. So after seeing this in a theater I watched the first three again over the next couple of weeks. Sure enough, I wasn't imagining it. They were a hundred times the movie of this one.     This new one was like one big joke. A fridge protecting you from a nuke blast? Swinging through the trees with the monkeys? Does Shiloh The Boof REALLY have to be in this movie? Come on. This was a half-way serious adventure-danger series with some sarcastic fun thrown in here and there.     For crying out loud the second one was so intense they invented the PG-13 rating just for that movie. Sure, the third one had a little more humor but was still very serious in parts. A UFO? Come on. A big plastic head that looks like something from Spenser Gifts? Come on. Even the Mummy sequels with Brenden Frasier were more serious adventure movies than this joke.    On that note, there is a very funny Southpark episode this season that focuses on how bad this movie really was. Check it out.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I'm a fan of everything Metallica does, including the \\"Load\\" and \\"Reload\\" albums, and even \\"St. Anger.\\" While I did enjoy many parts of \\"St. Anger,\\" I can admit it was easily the group's weakest album. It's biggest problem is that it didn't seem inspired, and at times it felt like the band was just making an album for the sake of making an album. This theory is only strengthened when you see the \\"Some Kind Of Monster\\" documentary showing the band in a vulnerable and dysfunctional state while making the album. But the band conquered its demons, went out on a successful tour, and looked confidently into the future.<br /><br />When it came time to make this record, Metallica knew it was time for a change, and they started with replacing long-time producer Bob Rock with the legendary Rick Rubin. Bob Rock is an amazing producer, but many of Metallica's critics have blamed him for commercializing the sound of the band. Rick Rubin was able to come in and give the band the kick in the butt that they needed (since Bob Rock had become more of a friend than a producer). Rubin told the band to find the hunger and the passion that they had on early albums like \\"Master Of Puppets.\\" So it became Metallica's goal to find their old drive and spirit without doing what had already been done. I'd say the band did exactly that. \\"Death Magnetic\\" stills sounds similar enough to the band's last 4 albums, but it has a lot more attitude and intensity than anything the band has done in 17 years. The band hasn't played this fast or this crazy since the 80's, and while the songs are heavy and riddled with dark lyrics, you get the impression that the band was really having a lot of fun making this album.<br /><br />The album beings with \\"That Was Just Your Life,\\" a dark and creepy guitar intro that eventually leads to the band rocking out \\"And Justice For All\\" style. James sings fast and the music is intense. The next track is \\"The End Of The Line,\\" and it's nearly impossible not to play air-guitar along with it. \\"The Day That Never Comes\\" might have puzzled a few fans as the first single, since it's mostly a slow jam and everyone kept hearing about how old-school this new Metallica album was supposed to sound. While the song could pass for something from the \\"Load\\" era (similar to \\"Unforgiven II\\"), it also has a lot in common with \\"Fade To Black\\" and \\"One.\\" Really great tune overall. Then there's \\"All Nightmare Long,\\" and all I'll say is that this is the best Metallica song in 17 years. It's fast, catchy, and everything I love about the band. \\"Cyanide\\" didn't really do much to grab me on the first listen, but later it really began to get stuck in my head. \\"The Unforgiven III\\" is easily the weakest song on the album in my opinion, and it's not as good as either of the previous 2 Unforgiven tunes. I like that a piano was used in it to change things up, and it has a cool solo, but otherwise the song doesn't do much for me. \\"Suicide & Redemption\\" is an instrumental jam that the band seemed to have fun with. The album closes with \\"My Apocalypse\\" and it's probably my 2nd favorite song on here. You can almost imagine this song being on \\"Kill 'Em All\\" if James had his old 20-year-old voice and a lot more reverb on the instruments.<br /><br />In case you're wondering, Kirk Hammett is indeed back to doing guitar solos. In fact, I'd say this is the best guitar work Kirk has done since \\"The Black Album\\" if not longer. Lars' snare drum no longer has the tin-can sound either. There have been some complaints that the sound production on this album is bad. Personally, I think people are just running out of things to complain about. When I listen to this album on my iTunes, it sounds louder and fuller than almost anything else that I have. However, I can agree that at times the drums seem to have been mixed a bit louder than they should be. But there's nothing wrong with the sound quality. I can't understand why someone would say that \\"And Justice For All\\" is one of the best metal albums ever, and then turn around and say that \\"Death Magnetic\\" sucks because of the sound quality. \\"Justice\\" was a great album, but THAT was bad sound quality. This album is loud, heavy, and it'll do for you what a Metallica album SHOULD do. Best album of 2008!nd then turn around and say that \\"Death Magnetic\\" sucks because of the sound quality. \\"Justice\\" was a great album, but THAT was bad sound quality. This album is loud, heavy, and it'll do for you what a Metallica album SHOULD do. Best album of 2008!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I've never seen a movie like this. The movie has a beautiful aspect (especially the end). And there are a few chuckles as well. Contrary to the more critical commentary, there is depth and complexity to the story that kind of requires you to see it more than once. I'm no genius, but what I gathered the basis of Donnie Darko to be is about our part in the deliberate DESIGN of our destiny, and I catch more each time I watch it.<br /><br />Regardless of anything, sincere thought and expression went in to the making of Donnie Darko. Mixed with skill and technical ability = Art.<br /><br />A WORK OF ART! In the top 100 movies of all time in my opinion.
0375757856|3.0|I was ambivalent about how many stars to give this book (3 or 4), but decided on the lower number, which I will get to in a moment.  First things first: if you are expecting a gothic, atmosphere-laden British detective novel, this isn't it. At all. In fact, I think this book is most aptly categorized as a satire, although it contains some classic detective novel features.  (If you want Collins in Gothic mode, check out \\"The Haunted Hotel\\").    As the product description is a little sparse, I'll try to give a plot synopsis as succinctly as possible.  During Britain's colonial takeover of India, a soldier steals a valuable diamond as a trophy of the conquest.  Because the diamond was part of a religious artifact, it is said to be cursed, and also has 3 attendants to guard it at all times (however ineffectually).  The diamond and it's Indian guardianship is passed down over several decades until the 18th birthday of Rachel Verinder, who is to inherit the diamond as part of a dubious bequest from her outcast uncle.  But on the night of the party, the diamond is stolen, and everyone in the house has an opinion as to who took it, and where it will eventually turn up.  The novel unfolds as each member of the household (and others) tell in turn their own stories relating to the theft of the diamond.      This telling of the story in turn (meaning shifting first person point of view) is pretty unique in the annals of mystery writing, although Ian Pears did it masterfully in \\"An Instance of the Fingerpost\\", and to my knowledge this is the first time such a technique was used in English literature.  Afterward it found favor with Faulkner and others, so this is significant from an historic standpoint, and offers reason enough to buy this book.    So, will you enjoy this, and should you buy it?  I think most people would enjoy this book, unless their taste is pretentiously high-brow.  There's a lot of humor in this book, so maybe save it for a rainy day.  Likewise, Collins doesan excellent job of keeping the reader in suspense about what happened to the diamond, and the device of telling the story in turn is fairly ingenious and well done.  However, two things about the book lowered it in my estimation.  One was that this book was originally serialized, and the text suffers from a kind of \\"tune in next week\\" syndrome, rather than moving at a steady pace.  The book is longer than it needed to be as a result.  The second thing that detracted from the experience for me was the ending, which I feel was a bit contrived.  All in all an enjoyable read, just not a productive one if you're not specifically studying the narrative technique.
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|I absolutely LOVE Brendan Fraser so I HAD to have this movie...<br /><br />The 3d effects are great! I get motion sickness so I had a problem leaving the glasses on for the whole movie. But as long as you can focus just on the movie it should be fine. I am just strange so LOL.<br /><br />But I highly recommend this movie for the whole family!!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This book was my favorite out of the Twilight Series. I loved the others, but I could not put this one down.  I wish they'd make a movie out of it, although it'd have to be 3 hours long and difficult to make.<br />I am not able to get this book out of my head... it was definitly the best book I've ever read.
B00003CX95|5.0|I ordered a copy of this movie from a reseller and I am very happy with the purhcase.<br /><br />As for the movie, you don't need my review...This movie is great both historically and aesethically.<br /><br />A+++
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This masterpiece is absolutely brilliant from start to finish just like Batman Begins. I give major thanks to Chris Nolan and the entire cast:)
0375842209|4.0|I was initially intrigued by the idea of death recounting the story of the little girl known as the \\"book thief.\\" That is what drew me to this book.     I don't read many novels anymore, but when I do, I hope to find something entertaining. Or perhaps it could offer a refreshing new style (e.g. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time). Ideally, I also want to learn something new about the world around me, such as a historical period, a certain culture, or the human condition.    I found the plot of The Book Thief engrossing. The mind boggling cruelty that humanity inflicts upon itself is well articulated here -- so is the saving grace of friendship and love.    As for the style, it is quite original, but there are also points where descriptions are too long and far removed from any obvious meaning or emotion. In such instances, a reader like myself is apt to skip over countless paragraphs. No big deal, but still, I kept thinking \\"why be so wordy?\\" This book could have been edited to far fewer than 576 pages without sacrificing the depth of the storyline.    Beyond the style, The Book Thief offered a refreshing perspective: that of ordinary German citizens during the Hitler regime. Countless books have been written about the atrocities of the holocaust, but here we also get to glimpse the trials and tribulations many Germans had to endure. This was the part of the book I was most glad to discover.     All in all, an entertaining, although quite depressing, read.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|When I was a kid I was taken by the tales of courage and bravery that the movies and books feed people. I read about the fighter pilots and the Commandos. War was all excitement and friends looking out for friends.<br /><br />Then one day the theme music of The World at War came on, the program launched straight in to archive footage of real battles, all the horror of mangled and mutilated bodies. I was mesmerized and that was the end of my warm and fluffy view of warfare. You only need to see a little bit of the real horror of war to know that it's not something good.<br /><br />As I watched the series I saw the terrifying assault on the world, the invasions and destruction, the displaced people and the dead. Germany and Japan sweeping over the face of the earth spreading fear and disaster. Then they were held and pushed back. But there was no great joy in the victories, they came at too high a cost. And yet in the end it had to be done and was worthwhile. But at what a terrible cost. This is one of the very few places you will see that cost.<br /><br />This production pulls no punches and Olivier, as a former member of the Fleet Air Arm, probably brings the true emotion of personal loss to this production, as well as his amazing voice. A modern voice might have trouble appreciating what it was really like to be involved in the desperate struggle of a World War.<br /><br />Now, so many years later, people forget. So I am buying this to casually watch while my 15 year old does her homework. So she'll get a less sterile view of history and maybe learn why my teachers were so utterly grim. I was taught by men who had fought through North Africa and Italy, who landed in France on D-Day and who slogged through the jungles of Burma. People need to know what it was really like and this is as good a way as still exists now that most of the veterans are old or dead.
0061341029|5.0|A must read for non profit Boards and Management. However you do need to read Good to Great first.

0142000663|5.0|The Grapes of Wrath tells the story of one family's journey from the impoverished state of Oklahoma to the promised land of California. Having lost their land to creditors and pressed to vacate, the Joads watch helplessly as land held by their family for repeated generations is unceremoniously uprooted and industrialized. With little left to their name, the dispossessed Joads set off on a westward journey in search of a better life. On the road they are joined by many thousands making the same trek, and soon new connections and kinships are formed. Their journey consists of hardships, deprivations, and death, pushing the Joads to their outer limits of endurance. However formidable their journey to California was, their toughest challenges still lie in wait beyond the Mojave Desert...<br /><br />Brilliantly woven, John Steinbeck's novel is a must read. I found it both inspiring and depressing; capable of imposing both grief and hope simultaneously. The Joads tragic losses will have you mournful one moment, while the next will find you filled with a hope that their undying resilience inspires.<br /><br />READ THIS BOOK. You'll be glad you did.
B000148KK2|3.0|A Jazz CD Not Just For Jazz Lovers    Diana Krall has made a bold move with this CD, veering away from the American Song Book she typically adheres to, and I am glad she's done it. Although originally attracted to her laid back reading of the standards, this gives a whole new dimension to her talent. The song on the CD that first caught my ear was \\"Narrow Daylight\\"--all about reading between the lines, such as:     \\"I walked through halls of reputation, among the infamous too  As the camera clings to the common thread, beyond all vanity  Into a gaze to shoot you through\\"    I wonder to myself, is this the photographer's point of view?  I decide it is, and that he or she is commenting on the vanity of those of high reputation and essentially ripping their vanity away.  Stripped down to the \\"common thread\\" which shows they are just people, despite their resplendent attire ...The photographer's lens sees their foibles.      I am deeply moved by the line in Narrow Daylight,  \\"washing away all the sadness and tears, that will never fall so heavily again\\", not so much by the words but my Ms. Krall's typically restrained and yet simultaneously deeply passionate reading of the line.    And I could go on song by song about the meaning, passion, and the always subtle play of the lyrics, Diana's relaxing voice and reliably top notch musicians blending into a combination of vivacious tunes, tales of love lost, and coursing through the entire collection of songs, the rousing song of a mature women:  One expressing her freedom and power, all on her own, not as a man's women--but as creator of her own art and excitement.  Listen to \\"I'm Coming Through\\", all about moving on, lonely or not.      Those faithful to the standards will be happy that Krall returns to them in subsequent releases, but I for one hope to hear more along the lines of \\"Girl in the Other Room\\".

0321344758|5.0|Until very recently, the subject of `usability' remained arguably as one of the `most' talked-after and yet `least' understood topic in the field of web designing.    Till Steve Krug came with his book `Don't Make Me Think'. He made it clear from the title of a book that essays on the importance of offering a web user with the opportunity of easy navigation. And he shows us the way to negate every chance where subjugating a visitor to ponder on the points of `what' and `how' is no less than a crime in the world of web.    We at Synapse Communications know how plentifully the book has helped us in the times of need. If today we are amongst one of the leading Indian companies in the arena of we development, books like this, wonderfully serve as the guiding force ahead of each of our steps towards delivering efficient web development solution to our clients world-wide.    I am thankful to Mr. Shamit Khemka, the CEO of Synapse Communications, for introducing me to a book that is so excellently simple and yet explicit in elaborating the subject of web usability.    Be it Synapse Interactive or Synapse India - the two sister concerns of Synapse Communication; for all the individuals associated with the company, `Don't Make Me Think' helps us to think right and put all the essentials into practice.
B00006I53S|4.0|If you are looking for one lens for your D-SLR this is the one to purchase.Image quality is excellent except (as usual) at extremes of focal length.  The IS works very well and really does allow you to shoot at least 1 and often 2 stops higher.  It is larger and significantly heavier than the kit lens but after a few days you don't really notice it.  As others have noted the lens does extend under its own weight when carried on a neck strap but it does quickly snap back wnen needed.As an amatuer photographer I don't see any need to purchase any other lenses in thes focal range.

0670020745|5.0|I first came across Jill Bolte Taylor, Phd when her speech at TED (an annual conference devoted to Technology, Entertainment, Design) went viral. In it, she describes how she witnessed herself having a stroke and the subsequent feeling of peace that enveloped her when her logical left brain shut down and her right brain became dominant. I became intrigued after watching the video and then read the book.    The book expounds on her experience while having the stroke and her subsequent recovery. It was amazing on many levels:   (1) She gives a 1st person narrative of her experience of the stroke and recovery but she doesn't portray it as something we should all pity and feel sorry for. Instead, she lays it out not unlike an explorer discovering new territory, full of suspense and wonder.    (2) She gives incredible tips on how to communicate with and care for stroke victims. For e.g., some people would yell at her after they saw she didn't understand what they were saying. However, she wasn't deaf. She could only process one word at a time. If those people would have spoken more slowly rather than loudly, she would have been able to understand them. This is something that would never have occurred to me if I hadn't read this book.    (3) She takes us on a tour of the 'mystical' right side of her brain which little is known about and whose capabilities in today's world seem to be dismissed. She says the right side of the brain is the gateway to enlightenment and nirvana. She shares tips on how to 'tend the garden of your mind' and to interrupt or stop those stories we all tell ourselves over and over again (usually about how we are deficient, not good enough, etc.). She calls them loops.    Dr. Taylor's tips about how we can all achieve nirvana by accessing the right side of the brain as a conscious process is worth the price of the book many times over. We all have a \\"loop of deep inner peace\\" wired into our neurological circuitry in our right brain and we can consciously choose  to run this loop whenever we wish.    Closely related to this topic are books by Ariel & Shya Kane. They've written three outstanding books: [[ASIN:0071601082 Working on Yourself Doesn't Work: The 3 Simple Ideas That Will Instantaneously Transform Your Life]], [[ASIN:0071601104 How to Create a Magical Relationship: The 3 Simple Ideas that Will Instantaneously Transform Your Love Life]] & [[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]]. The Kanes have been teaching about accessing the magic of the right-side of the brain for over 20 years and their book is chock full of tips, and stories on how to recognize those loops Dr. Taylor talks about and how to bypass them. If you're serious about getting enlightened, get Dr. Taylor's and the Kanes'  books NOW!

6305428352|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, I was a young teenager visiting my grandparents. It was coming on TV one night, and my grandmother mentioned that I would probably most enjoy it. As always, she was correct. Mr. Holland's Opus is, by far, one the BEST movies ever made!!! There are so many personalities exhibited; full ranges of emotions explored and expressed. It is amazing to watch the unfolding of a person's life. And it is truly wondrous to see how so many small actions and events affect so many people. This movie particularly touches my heart because I am currently seeking teacher certification. It is movies like Mr. Holland's Opus that encourage me, and prove that an individual, or more personally, a teacher, can make a tremendous impact on a child and/or community. I, in turn, encourage you, the reader, to watch Mr. Holland's Opus, and be moved in the same ways so many others have.[[ASIN:6305428352 Mr. Holland's Opus]]
0671027344|5.0|It's been awhile since I read Perks, and I don't recall when I first started reading it, but I distinctly remember the night I finished it.  I couldn't put it down, reading until the middle of the night, out on the couch while my husband slept.  And that's where he found me, sitting with the book in my lap, crying deeply.  Stephen Chbosky created a protagonist who's adolescence was incredibly real and familiar, and in Charlie's story I saw my own high school memories -  of being taken under the wing of an older crowd, and of being left behind as they graduated.  The novel, written in the form of Charlie's anonymous letters to 'a friend', creates an interesting format for the narrative and truly reveals the author's gift for natural voice.  We are voyeurs, reading letters not meant for us, written by a high school freshman who perhaps feels things too deeply.  And maybe that's why I was so moved by it - because as I read Charlie's letters about his own life, I got to know him, and care about him, and relate to him in a way a third person account, or even a standard first person account wouldn't have facilitated.  I'll surely reread Perks every few years, when I want to remember the good and bad of high school and shed some tears, the way you do with an old box of letters you keep under the bed because they mean too much to throw away.
B000EJ9VUW|3.0|While a lot of the percussion is interesting, this just isn't an album that I ever want to sit and listen through all the way.  I admire a lot of what the band is trying to accomplish on this album (which is why I gave it three stars overall), but I can't say I enjoy listening to all of it.  So 4 stars for performance but 2 stars for likeability averages out to 3 stars.
0743298020|4.0|Margaret is a biographer who works in her father's bookshop.  She loves all things books and reads constantly.  But she isn't one for popular fiction.  However, when she is contacted by a famous author who wants Margaret to write her biography, Margaret is intrigued.  The author, Vida Winter, is one of the most popular fiction writers of her time and Margaret has never read any of her work.  She settles down to read Ms. Winter's collection of short stories which is supposed to consist of 13 tales.  However there are only 12.  And they haunt Margaret who sets off to learn the truth of Vida Winter's background.  What Margaret discovers is a long story with twists, turns, secrets, and ghosts.      This book is a great example of fine storytelling.  The author weaves and winds through the plot brilliantly and keeps the pages turning.  At the same time, it is a sophisticated plot and not the type of suspense novel that is typically called a beach read.  My only complaint is that there are times when it drags a bit, but still you are intrigued enough to keep going.  Good surprises along the way make for a very good novel.

0316017922|5.0|\\"Outliers\\", like other Gladwell books, is very enjoyable. It offers some interesting perspectives about what makes some people more successful than others, with particular emphasis on those who far exceed expectations. Many of the book's criticisms focus on what the book is not. I think that is a mistake. This is simply a fine book, a very thoughtful and easy read. The book goes into how one's ethnic roots and specific opportunities set the stage for dramatic success, then working hard takes over. For example:<br /><br />1. An ancestral emphasis on community involvement can lead to health results which beat the odds.<br /><br />2. The date of one's birth can affect athletic and academic success, as the oldest in a group of youth, will lead to the 'Matthew Effect', better coaching/teaching, more games/practice, etc. There is an accumulative advantage. On a list of the wealthiest people of all-time, besides opportunity showing up with so many from America, among that group, being born around 1835 and around 1955 stand out, to take advantage of when railroads and Wall Street emerged and when computer time-sharing emerged, respectively.<br /><br />3. The 10,000 hour rule. Gladwell thinks about 10,000 hours of concentrating at a skill is necessary to excel at something.<br /><br />4. Whether it is height in basketball or IQ, just being tall enough or intelligent enough is all that really matters, same with colleges as long as they are good enough. Practical intelligence, knowledge and savvy are what really counts and family background is the key to having those. Parents should be involved with their children, with lots of negotiating and expectations of child talk-back, necessary to cause a child to develop a sense of entitlement, maybe not the most moral approach, but extreme success madates that.<br /><br />5. Jewish immigrants had advantage of occupational skills, like in the garment industry - enterpreneurial skills versus other immigrants like peasant farmers. Work was more meaningful. Their offspring saw this, plus NYC public schools were probably the best in the world at the time.<br /><br />6. Harlan, Kentucky is an example of herdsmen settlers, with a culture of honor from Scotch-Irish ancestors, influenced descendants, Gladwell saying that crime in the South more influenced more by personal than economic reasons. Certain 'insult' words have bigger effect.<br /><br />7. Plane crashes are more from human errors in teamwork and communication. Cultural respect for authority a big factor; can keep a subordinate from directing a superior in an emergency. Plus, 'mitigated speech' can be a problem. Can be remedied by training in 'Aviation English'.<br /><br />8. Asians being better in Math, likely related to ancestral tradition of rice paddies, which are complicated and require hard work throughout the year. Western farming is more mechanical with usually an off-season with little work. Here again, more meaningful and hard work. Plus, Asians learn to count faster because of language differences for numbers.<br /><br />9. K.I.P.P. Academy in the Bronx, charter middle school, is successful because it has long school days and short summer vacations, with students who commit to work hard. Studies have shown schools generally do well when they are in session, the problem are kids losing ground without good parental involvement during summer vacation. So, it is possible to make up for poor childhood family situations. Makes school meaningful. Incentives, rewards, fun and discipline is the formula.<br /><br />A terrific book.this, plus NYC public schools were probably the best in the world at the time.    6.

B001J2WNE4|3.0|There are a couple great songs on it, and a lot of ok songs....i think it works better as mood music to be played lightly in the background rather than at full volume to listen to all the words. Its great for when you are sitting in the car having a conversation with a girl, but gets long in the tooth quickly when you are driving around actually listening to the album.
B001DHXT20|3.0|The Incredible Hulk is a better version than Ang Lee's Hulk which was released a few years ago. This particular movie is more lively and exciting but it is not a perfect action flick. Edward Norton and Liv Tyler make a lovely couple as Bruce and Betty and William Hurt is pretty flawless in terms of acting. Stan Lee makes a cameo apperance while Tom Roth once again steals every scene, he is truly creepy in this. Good solid movie with excellent special effects.
0743289692|5.0|A truly fascinating and inspiring autobiography of a true human rights activist and a truly courageous fighter who has survived the victimization of Islamists and their despicable leftwing backers, for speaking the truth and standing up against evil and abuse of women.<br /><br />The author talks of her childhood and youth in Somalia, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia and Kenya,and of the narrow minded bigotry of the Muslim world today.<br />She recounts the horrors of genital mutilation in Somalia, the racial prejudice in Saudi Arabia against non-Arabs (especially Africans), the complete hatred and Nazi-like brainwashing she witnessed in Saudi Arabia against the Jews (which takes place in most of the Islamic world: \\"In Saudi Arabia everything bad was the fault of the Jews. When the air conditioner broke, or suddenly the tap stopped running, the Saudi woman next door used to say the Jews did it. The children next door were taught to pray for the health of their parents and the destruction of the Jews. Later when we went to school, our teachers lamented at length all the evil things Jews had done and planned to do against Muslims...Sister Aziza told us about the Jews. She described them in such a way that I imagined them as physically monstrous: they had horns on their heads and noses so monstrous they stuck out like great beaks. Devil and djinns literally flew out of their heads to mislead Muslims and spread evil. Everything that went wrong was the fault of the Jews...The Jews controlled the world, and that was why we had to be pure, to resist this evil influence. Islam was under attack and we should step forward and fight the Jews, for only if all Jews were destroyed would peace come to Muslims\\".<br /><br />The author describes the slow opening up of her minds against Islamic bigotry and enslavement of the spirit.

031606792X|5.0|I discovered this saga about a week into November, it took me about 2 days to track down a book store that sold the books.. (I live in Jamaica, the Caribbean) and they only had books 2 and 4 .. imagine how crazy I was, but I begged around til I found a few friends (far and wide) who had one or two, so I could borrow and read. I think I sat down and was done in one day, my eyes puffy and my throat sore. I laughed with Bella, I cried with Jacob and my heart ached with Edward!     As a 'struggling young writer' of many out there, this book, aside from my lifelong fascination with vampires, which to my delight, I could get into (matter of fact, screw Hollywood's version .. I want a Cullen!) the humanity (for lack of a better word) of the Cullen family is practically something you see yourself drawn to.. Growing with Bella from her first day in Forks to her last day (in the story) in that fated meadow, you don't want anything to happen to her, but at the same time you know something must happen for her! It's like fate (no longer a flimsy thread, but golden sinew) she's literally the ugly duckling, and ends up the most graceful Swan (pun intended) ever! (I think Mrs. Meyer had a reason for the last name too!)     But all in all, if you've forgotten what love felt like, or never knew what it was, you'll be just a bit more jealous of the pages of that book, the characters, the suspense, the intensity.. and just about leaves you wondering .. \\"what if?...\\"
B000W8OM2C|3.0|This sequel is not nearly as funny and clever as the first one.  The main male character was a sleazy jerk, and the dynamics between the characters was dull and cliche.  There were a few funny moments so it was still worth seeing.
B001GQACGO|1.0|First off she has a wonderful voice and talent. However, she also works for macdonalds, some credit card company, and direct tv to name the ones i've seen. Music fails to be art or even true expression when it is used to fuel and persuade millions of fans to buy buy buy. It's sad to see true talent taken and bastardized by corporations for their own gain, and at the public's expense. As Deltron states, \\"Upgrade your gray matter, cuz one day it may matter\\".
0060935464|5.0|If you haven't read this book yet, stop whatever it is that you're doing, go immediately to a book store, and pick this up.  To Kill a Mockingbird is among the best books I've ever read.      For those that haven't read this, or haven't seen the film version with Gregory Peck, which is also outstanding, To Kill a Mockingbird is about the Finch family.  Atticus Finch is a lawyer and widower in a small Alabama town during the Great Depression.  He has two children:  Jem, an 11-year old boy, and Scout, an 8-year old girl.  Their lives are turned upside down when Atticus is appointed to represent Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman.  The story is told from Scout's perspective.    While the story is framed around social and racial issues in the South, it's really about much more than that:  primarily, it's a story about growing up.  The Robinson case makes the transitions that Jem and Scout go through much more dramatic, but they experience the same kind of wonder and confusion that all of us experience as we move from childhood to young adulthood.      Atticus is exactly the kind of person we aspire to be:  honest, caring, understanding, moral, and unflappable.  You sort of get the impression of Atticus as the last righteous man.  Atticus lives his philosophy:  \\"The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience\\" (p. 120).  In short, Atticus is the emodiment of human dignity--not just for himself, but for others too.  If you aren't moved by his closing argument in the Robinson trial, you may be in a coma.    I thought it was odd, and somewhat revealing hearing the kids, especially Scout, describe their father:  \\"Atticus was feeble:  he was nearly fifty.  When Jem and I asked him why he was so old, he said he got started late, which we felt reflected upon his abilities and manliness....Our father didn't do anything.  He worked in an office, not in a drugstore.  Atticus didn't drive a dump truck for the county, he was not thesheriff, he did not farm, work in a garage, or do anything that could possibly arouse the admiration of anyone.\\"  Ouch.  But this is Scout with a child's perspective; her growing maturity changes the way both she and Jem see their father.    Harper Lee never wrote another novel; she grew up with and remained a close friend of Truman Capote's until his death.  Harper Lee and Gregory Peck also remained close friends until his demise; Peck's grandson was named Harper in her honor.      To Kill a Mockingbird won the Pulitzer Prize for a reason:  it's a masterpiece.  Its warmth, compassion, comedy, and tragedy are rendered with such humanity that it honestly blew me away.  I can't recommend it enough.  Read it today.
B001GKJ2E8|2.0|Okay, let me start off by explaining the two star rating.  I'll give it props for not putting me to sleep, it accomplished that much.<br />Now for the cons:<br />I would like to dedicate this review to everyone who thought this movie was great and who slammed on other reviewers who complained about the R rated content.<br />First of all, this movie should have been rated PG13.  They should have cut some of the language and gore effects, and it would have done just fine as a PG13 flick similar to Mission Impossible, Bourne, and Transporter.  When I was watching this movie, I felt the vibe that this should be a PG13 movie.  The trailers made it look more like it would be a PG13 action flick and not R, it just wasn't dark enough to be R.<br />I felt that most of the strong language was out of place and the writers stuck the words in there just to have them there, no other reason.  The dialogue did not flow well, and the language used did not feel like it would have been said naturally in an office setting or even in every day life.<br />Also, the violence.  Yeah, I'm a guy and I like violent films, but this was so overdone.  I felt that the writers and directors went out of there way to try to make the gore as bloody and unrealistic as possible for the R rating, same with the language.  Before someone starts running their mouth at me, I will say that I enjoy many R movies.  300 had a lot of gore, but that movie was meant to be R from the beginning, most war movies are.  Shooter was an R movie with a lot of violence and some strong language that did not go over the top.  The producers did not have to go out of their way to try and make Shooter R, it was simply the rating that came naturally.<br />Anyway, this movie was poorly executed, poorly targeted, acting was okay, but not great, dialogue was really weak, the plot was typical, go kill everybody.<br />Oh yeah, one more thing I have to mention, you had to have that stupid line at the end \\"What the F*** have you done lately\\".  Dumb. LOL.  James McAvoy is a joke, Mark Whalberg has him owned!James McAvoy is a joke, Mark Whalberg has him owned!
0440242576|5.0|Luther and Nora Krank's daughter, Blair, has decided that now, after graduate school, she will join the Peace Corps and head off to distant Peru.  Blair departs just after Thanksgiving, leaving Luther and Nora with a heavy sense of empty-nest syndrome.  Luther doesn't know how to face Christmas this year without his daughter.  Digging through his past records (he's a Tax Accountant by trade) he realizes that last year they spent $6,100 on Christmas and have nothing to show for it.  So this year, he decides to skip Christmas and take Nora on a ten day tropical cruise instead.<br /><br />Nora, at first, is reluctant but finally agrees.  There's so many things to miss; the gifts, the shopping, their home party, office parties, the decorating, the food, the donations, the policeman's and fireman's funds, the parade, and more.  It becomes tougher and tougher for Luther and Nora to stick to their guns, especially when the entire world thinks that they've gone crazy.<br /><br />With each new assault on his right to do as he pleased, Luther becomes more determined to ignore Christmas.  Friends and neighbors, the whole town, act as if they'd discovered a new variety of sin.  (Nora's bikini story at the tanning bed, where afterwards she runs into the minister of their church, is hilarious)  They're decision even attracts the town's small newspaper.  Despite the aggravation and opposition they face, Luther and Nora are ready to embark on a whole new phase of their lives.  Until Blair calls home, with some startling news.<br /><br />'Skipping Christmas' a short but very well written story filled to the brim with the brighter and darker sides of humanity, friendship, and frustration.  There's plenty of humor along with the nuisances, some when you least expect it.  The characters are fully fleshed, and could be your very own neighbors.  This is the perfect little volume to give as a Christmas gift, heartwarming and whimsical.  I highly recommend this book, especially during the Holiday Season.  A solid 5 stars.  Enjoy!5 stars.  Enjoy!

B001GKJ2E8|4.0|Not a great movie but an entertaining action movie. Recommended and worth seeing if you like action and special effects. Again nobody gives a great performance but overall the acting was acceptable. If you are looking for realism or a strong plot then probably not for you.   I looked at some of the negative reviews and obviously some people missed the point of this movie. The point is entertainment! This movie is based on a comic book! It is not a documentary! One reviewer was looking for \\"genuine emotion\\"? They should have done more research before seeing the movie.
B00000IREA|5.0|After hearing about this film for years, I finally decided to give the dvd a watch. I honestly didn't know what to expect, but I really didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did. I was familiar enough with the plot, which is \\"Barbarella gets into trouble, loses her outfit, then ends up getting it on\\". I just didn't think it would come together this well.<br /><br />The charming Jane Fonda stars as a space navigatrix who must go to a far off and \\"barbaric\\" planet in order to discover what has come of the scientist Duran Duran (the 80s band that came along later named themselves after this scientist). Her quest is to discover what he's done with his deadly weapon, a weapon that could put to end the peaceful existence of Earth. Along the way she has several erotic encounters with various men along the way (and one near encounter with a woman).<br /><br />The film may have been made to be thrilling at points (not in a sexual sense), but the film mostly comes off as a comedy. The sex scenes are equally amusing with some of the after effects being hilarious. (Barbarella's hair curls after one particular orgasm.) The sex scenes are pretty tame by today's standards, but there is a bit of nudity throughout the movie. (The film actually begins with a striptease to the movie's themesong.) Even with the numerous flaws, the film shines as only a cult classic can. This film is definately not for everyone & I'd honestly recommend that most people rent it before they but it. Some will watch it & buy it without hesitation, but some will find it's not to their liking.<br /><br />5/5
1568987846|3.0|A Year of Mornings: 3191 Miles Apart is a photographic collaboration between Maria Alexandra Vettese (Portland, Maine) and Stephanie Congdon Barnes (Portland, Oregon). The two met online and discovered that each had interests in crafts and a passion for simplicity in images. After a series of discussions, they embarked upon a year-long project in December 2006, in which each agreed to take a photo every morning for a year and then post that photo onto a shared blog. ([...])   They uploaded photographs that are posted as diptychs, and time after time had uncanny resemblances. On certain days, I wondered if the two discussed what to photograph--such as subjects, angles, etc. For example, the first set of images were both of eggs. There were also diptychs in which comparisons of colors were made--like green grass with a white ladder compared to a pair of green socks with a white embroidered design. Not all of them have such obvious comparisons, but still make for interesting diptychs.   I do have some complaints about the book. First, the paper that it is printed on dulls the colors, and I would've liked to see these images in their true colors, not a muted representation. Second, I wish that they would have showed all of the images from that year instead of just selections, and much larger than thumbnail sizes.   Overall, I think that the idea of the collaboration, as well as the content displayed on the website, was a fantastic idea that was poorly represented in the form of a book. Perhaps it would have been better left as a digital project.
B000002MU3|4.0|R.E.M. used to be a band that shunned spotlights in an almost perverse fashion, to the point that they refused to even show themselves in their videos. Yet after the successful trilogy of albums [[ASIN:B0006IIPEY Green]], [[ASIN:B0006ICF9A Out of Time]] and [[ASIN:B0006ICF9K Automatic for the People]], they'd become one of the biggest rock bands in the world, scored number one albums, top ten singles, the cover of the Rolling Stone, and sold out world tours.

Yet when \\"Automatic\\" came out, it was almost a reaction to the onslaught of grunge.

Cobain's 1994 suicide laid those plans to rest, and his ghost haunts many of the songs on this CD. In particular, the eulogy of \\"Let Me In,\\" a feedback and organ drenched song worthy of Jesus and Mary Chain, pays tribute to their lost friend, while the piled on overdriven guitars show how much Seattle influenced the Athens boys this time around.<br /><br />Success also is a running theme. \\"I'm not commodity\\" bleats Stipe on \\"King of Comedy.\\" Questions of how much the public gets to know about the men who make the music run prevalent in \\"I Don't Sleep I Dream,\\" \\"Star 69\\" and \\"Circus Envy.\\" The whip-crack of Peter Buck's guitars (esp on \\"Crush With Eyeliner\\" and \\"Circus Envy\\") are the hardest head ever played until [[ASIN:B0013BNY2Q Accelerate]] some 14 years later.

Nathon Fillion (captain Hammer) was also excellent and fun and the songs were, once again, well written, appropriate for the scenes and moment, as well as the great music. No dance numbers, but we didn't need them. This was really a work of art. I just love it, and I want more from Joss. God Bless Joss Whedon!     HOWEVER, I don't know for something so short should it be worth $10+. We already paid for it on iTunes. A price of around $5.99--at least-- would be a little more worth it. But I am grateful that it is on DVD, but that may be a tad pricey. Thanks anyway Joss!
0061122416|5.0|This book is my all-time favorite.  I have read it more times than I can count and it never loses its charm.  There have been times when I have finished reading the last page only to turn to the beginning and immediately start reading it all over again.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to people of all ages and backgrounds.  This beautifully written simple tale is inspiring and uplifting in a subtle, refreshing way.  If you are the type of person who believes in fate, following your heart or that everything happens for a reason, you will absolutely love this book!
B0001I561E|1.0|Do not buy from this seller - false ads and bogus copies.  I ordered what was supposed to be a NEW DVD and instead was shipped a BADLY BURNED COPY.  And the seller never replied to my email - fortunately, Amazon has wonderful customer service.
B001ED7C58|5.0|This soundtrack is excellent and has a variety of genres represented! The songs were not exactly what I \\"pictured\\" when I read the books, but almost all of them enhanced the scenes they were in, particularly Supermassive Black Hole (the baseball scene), Never Think (Port Angeles dinner), Eyes on Fire (Bella looking for Edward), and especially Flightless Bird, American Mouth (Prom). The one disappointment for me was that Let Me Sign, which played during a pivotal and beautiful part of the movie, was left off the soundtrack. I highly recommend purchasing it!
B00007GZR5|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I highly recommend it to anyone that is looking for humor, suspense, and a great love story.
1416511946|5.0|I purchased this Book for my 15 year old Daughter and ended up getting into myself. It is a very interesting look into the life of Nikki Sixx during the mid to late 80's. Very good book. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Motley Crue. The book arrived very quickly. I was very please with the whole order process
B0013FBS20|5.0|I have the Charlton Heston version of this film, titled \\"The Omega Man,\\" and can say that \\"I Am Legend\\" is a great remake of the story.  While TOM was more religious in nature, which was accepted at the time (it was in essence a Vegetable Myth story,) IAL takes a more objective view of the story.  And the approaches to the theory behind the approach that the writers took, with the research into the development of mutations of viruses made it the more believable.      I applaud the believability that the writers presented.
B001EYGOEM|4.0|From beginning to end this album sparkles with fine ballads and funky country pop.Sweet girl who has shown her writing skills pretty well here.Pretty mature, musically for an eighteen year old girl.Her debut was fine,but to me,she shines more on this effort.Fearless,Love Story,White Horse,Breathe,You Tell Me Why,You're Not Sorry & Best Day are my faves.If you bought her self-titled release,there is no reason to stop there.Go out and get Fearless,now...You won't be disappointed.
0316113506|5.0|Outstanding service.  Got the item I ordered in a short amount of time, and it is exactly as described.  Thanks!!!
0439813786|5.0|This book is geared toward young adults, but don't let that stop you.  Selznick offers an exciting story in a novel format.  The book is neither traditional novel nor graphic novel: Selznick mixes pages of text with pages of wordless illustrations which flesh out characters and advance the plot.<br /><br />Hugo Cabret is an orphan who lived in the train station, where his uncle keeps the clocks running.  But his uncle has disappeared, so Hugo keeps the clocks going while trying to fix a mysterious automaton his father left behind.  Add in a toy peddler, an audacious young girl, a bookseller, and an adolescent cinephile, and you have a recipe for success!  (And we learn something about early cinema to boot.)<br /><br />Although the book is 550 pages, it took about two hours to read (due to all the picture pages): It was the most pleasurable and easy two hours I've spent in a long time!
B000002GBB|3.0|By the time \\"Pieces Of Eight\\" was released in 1978 Styx were on a roll.  Their previous album \\"The Grand Illusion\\" had been both an artistic and commercial success and \\"Pieces\\" would prove to be another multi-platinum seller.  The album's two big hit singles \\"Blue Collar Man\\" and \\"Renegade\\" were both Tommy Shaw penned hard rock songs that featured the band at their heaviest.  In fact Shaw really has most of the best moments on this album with the folksy \\"Sing For The Day\\" being another highlight.  The Dennis Deyong tracks don't fare as well.  \\"I'm Okay\\", \\"Lords Of The Ring\\" and \\"Queen Of Spades\\" don't really work as either progressive rock epics or rockers and end up falling a bit flat.  The title track fares a bit better, and is a decent albeit short progressive rock song.  James Young's contribution \\"Great White Hope\\" is not one of his better one's either and is ultimately forgettable compared to many of his other compositions.  This album has not aged all that well and comes across as quite dated in spots.  Overall \\"Pieces Of Eight\\" is an average Styx album and worth owning, but is not nearly as good as it's predecessor \\"The Grand Illusion\\".
B00005MEW1|4.0|Nosferatu: The Gothic Industrial Mix is definitely worth a look and I rate this DVD at four stars for being very entertaining. Although this film is scarcely new news, watching it convinced me that this old production deserves credit for being something otherworldly and very special. It was a film with all the virtues of the old silent cinema which had to rely on \\"over the top\\" acting to make up for the lack of a soundtrack. The make up, acting and body language of Count Orlock were great, and justify the mystique associated with this grand old film.
B00006I53S|3.0|Purchased June 24, 2008    A little disappointed so far.    The lens creep is more like a lens drop!     The outside shots are very good for the most part (how much is me or the lens!) I have some beautiful shots of weddings and outdoor events on bright days, but hit and miss indoors.     Autofocus not quick indoors and I had expected more from the IS feature.    In a brightly lit gymnasium, the shots were very dull and lifeless and I was unable to get anything good with movement of the subject. Wish I had had my 1.8 50mm Canon for that event!    I will probably sell and look for something else.
0143038419|1.0|Had thought I would like to read this book, but once I read the premise reconsidered. Realized she wanted neither a child nor her husband...divorced and  transformed into a hedonist. GROTESQUE! Spiritual? Baloney. Serve in a soup kitchen. Life isn't all about self. A little less navel gazing, PLEASE!
B001H5X7I4|1.0|\\"Tropic Thunder,\\" the movie critics darling from the summer of 2008, suffers from the massive sin of being slightly amusing and painfully disappointing (once you've seen the trailer there's no reason to see the rest).    Critics drooled all over it because Director Ben Stiller skewers Hollywood insiders and there's nothing that movie critics fawn over more than a movie that savages directors, actors, agents, and filmmaking (because they all secretly hate the business). Besides, the critics can actually understand the in-jokes.    The movie was a huge marketing success - web sites, viral videos, and a massive push by \\"insiders.\\" It raked in more than $110 million to qualify for blockbuster status. The hype was that \\"Tropic Thunder\\" was raw and controversial (mental health advocates gave the film an enormous boost when they protested against the depiction of mentally-handicapped people in the film).    Unfortunately, \\"Tropic Thunder\\" is an overhyped dud done in by a lame plot, variety show quality gags, and the seriously defective acting of one Ben Stiller. And the supposedly no-holds barred gags? Saturday Night Live is more controversial.    Here's the concept: a group of self-absorbed A-list actors are filming a Vietnam movie. Losing control of the movie, the director decides to take his pampered actors into jungle for some guerilla filming. A landmine kills the director and the actors - left on their own - are attacked by real drug-dealing rebels (and think the action is part of the script).    Bored yet?    The plot, of course, only works if the characters are idiots - which they are.  Stiller has the acting range of a turnip. Like his character in \\"Zoolander,\\" who uses the same pursed-lip expression in all of his photo shoots, Stiller plays the same character over and over and over again. He's the Groundhog Day of actors.  This time Stiller plays washed up action star Tugg Speedman (a cross between Rambo and Tom Cruise). He's hopelessly insecure and utters dialoglike: \\"Somebody said they were close to me?\\" And, of course, he pouts like only Stiller can pout.    Every time Stiller is on screen is a grating experience. You want to scream: \\"Stop the madness!\\" at the top of your lungs.    Robert Downey Jr. fairs better as the Oscar winning method actor Kirk Lazarus. Lazarus has a skin pigmentation process so he can play a black sergeant - and is completely in-character throughout the film. Unfortunately, the role limits Downey's maniac comedic skills - and he ends up being a one-trick pony. The gag is funny - for about five minutes.    Then there is Jack Black, who is completely wasted as the drug-addicted \\"fat\\" comedian. The role is a cliché wrapped in a stereotype and delivered as a typecast. He actually bites a bat in half because it \\"stole\\" his drugs and is thrown half-naked over a water buffalo. Cheap gimmickry at its finest.    But the real problem with \\"Tropic Thunder\\" is the stupidity of the plot. Nothing makes sense. Once the actors get in the jungle, the film plays like a series of skits cobbled together with duct tape. It's hard to watch without that sinking feeling in your belly that you have been duped.    The real pain here? \\"TopicLink Thunder\\" was so successful that it will probably spawn a sequel.    \\"Stop the madness!\\"
B001FSDOZO|5.0|Another great album from a great band, although there were times Chad sounded more like James Hetfield with a touch of glam/pop.    I love the ballads and \\"this afternoon\\", but i hope they stick to the genre they've started on their next album. Sounding so \\"POP\\"py would turn away fanatics.
0596007124|5.0|I have been doing c# programming for about 3 years now. Mostly I did web apps and some utilities, but did do a few larger applications. For that entire time, I could never get my head wrapped around interfaces. I knew how to create them, but not really why, so I just never used them. By the end of the first chapter in Design Patterns, it all finally `CLICKED`. On thinking back on some of the projects I did, if I had this book to begin with, the projects would have gone smoother, especially when requirements changed.    The way O'Reilly's does the Head First series is absolutely amazing. I already have the OO Analysis & Design book that is next on my list. After that, I think I will give the javascript book a shot, as that is something that always seemed to cause me grief, but if that book is anything like the Design Patterns, I don't see not being able to fully grasp it.
B000A6CLL0|5.0|Long time Trek fan. I've seen all of the movies and every episode of every show (even every Enterprise - how many Trek fans can say that?), and the Xindi season probably stands as the most solid overall season of a Trek show (though a few DS9 seasons come *really* close). I have to hand it to them for pretty much ignoring Trek lore and trying something outright new after 2 shaky seasons under their belt and, other than a few references to existing canon and Andorian appearances, this season can stand well on its own as a good science fiction story arc even if you aren't familiar with Enterprise or even Trek itself. Some Trek fans didn't like that, I thought it was brilliant.    Once you get past the inane premise of Starfleet being made aware of the Xindi threat by their making a direct attack on Earth as a preliminary test for their doomsday weapon (actually happened as the finale of season 2), the rest of this season unfolds in a well paced and laid out storyline, with even the diversion stories meaning something in the end. The concept of the Xindi themselves, 5 different species (humanoid, arboreals, insectoid, reptilian, and aquatic) all originating from the same planet and evolving together (and a 6th technically, avian, though extinct and didn't make it to the present time of the story arc). Very diverse and conflicted, yet all unified in a common bond - the destruction of Earth and the (future) Federation which they have been led to believe will destroy them. The effects are top notch, especially considering all of the Xindi races have their own technology and look as well. The aquatics alone, as a non humanoid species living in water, would have been impossible to do on a tv budget even a few short years earlier. The Enterprise itself even takes progressive damage throughout the year - none of that \\"all fixed, everything is better\\" at the beginning of the next episode - they are forced to deal with their damage and limitations while cut off from most all oftheir allies while in the Xindi Expanse.    Go for season 4 of Enterprise if you're looking for more true canon prequel Trek (esp. the Mirror Universe eps featuring the Tholians) - if the first two seasons had been anything like the last season (4), or the third season of Enterprise had been the first, the show might have gone to 5-7 seasons.     As it stands though, if you just want to give Enterprise itself a try, go with season 3. It'll stand on it's own.
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|This movie was awesome I really enjoyed watching the movie it had a lot of action in it and there's going to be a Wanted 2 coming out in theatres and I can't wait to see that one but this movie had a lot of action in it I don't really go to a movie theatre that much instead my dad and I wait for them to come out on DVD and then we buy them and this is one I definately wanted to purchase and I would Recommend this movie to anyone who likes action movies like I do
0143038419|4.0|I did enjoy this book. I'm a fan of Travel and personal Memoirs. Although the author didn't manage to grip me passionately with her account of Italian life, Italian cuisine, or it's people she did reinforce the idea that the Italian language may just be the most beautiful language in the world. I had plans to learn either Italian or Spanish, quietly debating this decision for the last year or so (enough time to be fluent in either!). Of course one should learn Spanish, far more useful, but I just adore the sound of Italian. So after reading \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" I loaded my Learn Italian CD onto my IPOD and I've been happily listening to it, and (talking back to it when solo) at night and even at the gym while on the treadmill.  Apart from the travel aspect of the book which was great reading and very interesting, I appreciated her telling of her personal journey through depression. Her account offers insight on self-help techniques for overcoming depression, and how she used them. I've recommended this book to friends since reading it.

B001ED7C58|5.0|OMG, this CD is amazing.  It has awesome songs on it, and it introduced me to alot of songs I'd never have listened to if it wasn't for them being on the twilight soundtrack.  It's definately not preppy pop stuff so if thats all you listen to and you hate anything else then stop reading this review right now because your not ready for this CD but if you like Paramore and Linkin Park (and the other people on this CD) then buy this CD because it is truly amazing!!  And to me the songs scream TWILIGHT!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I really love this DVD. I worked out before using it, but never pushed myself too hard. Jillian makes me want to work hard and push myself through the workout. Level 1 is probably too difficult for a beginner, but some movement modifications are shown throughout. Anyone who needs a good, tough workout, should use this DVD.
B0000009SI|4.0|Apostrophe captures Frank Zappa right after releasing his incredibly diverse, whacky, energetic and exciting \\"Over-nite Sensation\\" album.  While Apostrophe doesn't quite have the same high points THAT album has, it's still pretty good.      Lyrically, like always, they are interesting and twisted, in *only* a way master Zappa knows how to create them.  I wouldn't be able to write lyrics this good in a million years!    The title song is absolutely great, and is a jazzy instrumental guitar jam, filled with memorable solos and neat fills and all those things a Hot Rats fan would probably like IMO.    There's a more distinct funky feeling in this album compared to previous Zappa releases, and I guess that's a good thing (I'm a fan of funk- just not a LOT of funk at once).  The lyrics will grow on you, and so will the whacky vocal melodies.  Frank Zappa is one of a kind, and this album shows you why.  The guy has a bunch of albums though, and I recommend \\"Over-night Sensation\\" before this one because that album is a little bit better if you ask me.  Still, Apostrophe holds up pretty well too.
B000EBD9TY|5.0|Elia Kazan's screen version of Tenessee William's firey work is a non stop emotional ride.  Marlon Brando revises his stage role as Stanley Kowalski, a working class man who lives in New Orleans with his wife Stella.  There life is a roughly passionate one which intensifies when Stella's southern belle sister Blanche DuBois arrives.  Blanche, portrayed so beautifully and truly by Vivien Leigh, that her husband Sir Lawrence Olivier once commented on how it almost broke her to play this role.  Blanche is mentally unstable, broken by the world and by distorted ideals.  Stanley immeadiately loathes Blanche and all that she pretends to be, allowing this hatred to consume him and become an animalistic urge that explodes at the end of the film. In all this film displays both the beauty and horror of human kind, it is a must see for all!
B001DHXT20|4.0|Fun movie and great watching but I still prefer the orginal over the new movie.
B001ED7C58|4.0|The music put together for this movie was awesome. It helped that Stephenie Meyer actually has playlists for each of her books to help guide the soundtrack of the movies. The is music that I wouldn't normally think of listening to, but I was surprised by how it works well together.  Bella's Lullaby was beautiful, and Rob Pattinson's song is amazing. If you adored the movie, then I think you need this soundtrack.
B001GKJ2E8|2.0|Edit 12/04/08: Based on comments regarding the movie's value and receiving unhelpful votes, I'd like to clarify a couple points.     If you justify the storyline being poor by saying \\"it's a comic book movie\\" or \\"you have to appreciate the special effects,\\" that's pretty ridiculous. For people to have had interest in the comic book (therefore inspiring a movie), it would have had an interesting and believable storyline. The movie should follow the same standards. There ARE good comic book movies with plots that aren't easily criticized. This movie is not one of them.    Second, if all you care about is action and special effects, why don't you just take the best of The Matrix, Lord of the Rings, Spider-Man, Fast and the Furious, Pirates of the Caribbean and any other movie you worship, mash all of the action scenes together, and watch it? At least then you wouldn't have to think about a plot. That's what you're getting at, right?    Finally, just because you liked the movie and I didn't doesn't mean it justifies a negative, unhelpful vote. I appreciate a good debate and constructive criticism, so leave me a comment if you think I'm out of line with my review. I'd love for you to tell me what I can do to improve my review.     ----    I remember when \\"Wanted\\" was in theaters. My boyfriend had an initial interest in seeing it but after several weeks, he forgot about it... Until the DVD release date came around! Never one to miss a DVD release, he picked it up and we had a movie night with \\"Wanted.\\"    What I \\"wanted\\" to do was roll my eyes. If you've seen any Angelina Jolie action movie (Tomb Raider, Mr. and Mrs. Smith), you've seen this movie. It's a lot of cold-faced staring, squinty-eyed scowling, puffed-out pouting and dramatic pew-pewing. I suppose for some people, Angelina Jolie is reason enough to watch a film!     The movie started out convincingly enough, with anxiety-prone loser Wes (McAvoy) giving us a glimpse of his mundane life. Soon enough, Fox (Jolie) steps in to recruit the spastic twenty-something to The Fraternity, an age-old clan of assassins trained to bend time and defy the laws of physics. The point: to avenge his late father, who possessed the same abilities his son would soon learn about.    I'll give it to them - the special effects, the chase scenes and the series of events leading viewers through Wes' training was pretty amazing. But it's nothing you haven't seen before - a la \\"Matrix.\\" However, when they mentioned Wes' room was his father's, the commentary and hilarity following that scene never ended. \\"I knew at that moment I had to train harder than ever before, know every move he ever made, etc. etc...\\" It was over for me.     After that, the movie was about as cliched as can be. Token gunfights, a betrayal, hot naked lady scene, and a not so surprising \\"twist\\" at the end. SPOILER: The \\"villain,\\" as his life is about to end, tells the protagonist Wes, that he is actually his father. Oh dear. First off, didn't see that coming (wink). Second, if you've chased a guy through God's creation, to hell and back, what are the odds that you're actually going to believe him?     Unfortunately, the movie's only good for eye candy and nothing more. My suggestion: borrow it from someone, enjoy the action shots (and let's not forget the Angelina), and pat yourself on the back for not wasting nearly two hours of your life.    Alternatively, my boyfriend thought it was \\"awesome.\\" Of course, that's what demographic this movie \\"Wanted.\\" Go figure!
B001DTPZNY|4.0|After a 15-year hiatus, Harrison Ford has reprised his best role as the swash-buckling, fedora-wearing archaeologist/university professor Indiana Jones.  This time, Indy's up against Russian agents led by a sword wielding female commander, played by Cate Blanchett.  The two groups are in pursuit of a crystal skull, which has powers related to a mythical city of gold.    Indy, along with his partner Mac, were captured by the Russians in Mexico.  Upon returning to the U.S., Indy and the Russians head to Roswell, New Mexico, site of the infamous \\"Area 51\\", which is loaded with secrets.  Indy is forced to locate a box containing the mummified remains of an extra-terrestrial who crashed in the desert.  But, Indy has a surprise in store.  After managing to escape from the Russians, Indy wanders into a specially-constructed city with mannequins designed to measure the effects of an atomic blast.  Indy manages to save himself by hiding inside a lead-protected refrigerator.  But, the adventure's just beginning.    Indy is then convinced to head to Peru at the behest of Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf).  Mutt's friend Professor Oxley, played by John Hurt, has been captured because he knows the location of the crystal skull. Oxley is also a colleague of Indy's.  It is said that whoever finds the skull and returns it to its rightful place will gain knowledge beyond their wildest dreams.  But, the Russians are on to the skull as well, and its a race between them and Indy to find the skull first.  Along the way, Marion Ravenwood, Indy's original love interest from \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" returns, played once again by Karen Allen.  Marion holds a revealing secret that surprises Indy.  Marion has softened somewhat over the years, but she still holds a spell over Indy.    Harrison Ford is once again at his swashbuckling best as Professor Jones.  Indy has become Ford's signature role over they years; even above his role of Han Solo in the first \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy.  Karen Allen is verygood as the gutsy but softer Marion, and Shia LaBeouf does a surprisingly good job as Mutt.  There is lots of great action scenes throughout: I especially liked the scenes with the giant ants, and, of course, there's some great comedy from Indy, too.  This film might not stack up to the first three movies in the series, but it is still very good and definitely worth watching.    I highly recommend this action-packed movie.  Its a must-see for Harrison Ford fans and fans of the first three Indiana Jones movies.
0446605409|4.0|This was my first DeMille book and I really enjoyed it.  I liked John Corey and want to read more books with him as the lead.  I also think the book dragged on a bit when persuing the murderer, but it was not enough to change my opinion that it was a really fun to read.

1595141979|5.0|I am a 23-year old young adult librarian, and all the teenagers these days are loving vampires, so I've found myself reading several of the different YA vampire series, and this is by far one of the best ones. They just keep getting better too. Shadow Kiss was wonderful---as in it was engrossing and emotionally exhausting. Rose really begins to question her relationship with Lissa, and her purpose in life and place in the world. Her relationship with Demitri deepens. I love Rose, I really do, she's tough and ballsy, qualities I wish I had more of, but she's a really good person too. Plus, Rose and Christian become better friends and do some serious damage to some Strigoi, which I loved. And at the end of the book, something horrific happens, that leaves me anxious and eager to find out what's going to happen next!
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Wow. I was lucky enough to see this at a screening in Pixar studios, and now I've just bought the DVD and watched it again. Wall-E harks back to the days of the silent movie, when dialog was not used as a substitute for story unfolding visually, and it succeeds triumphantly in reeling in the audience. Not only is the central relationship both touching and funny at the same time, it's founded in a very dark future where humans have trashed the earth and live lazily on an off-planet ship. To succeed in combining these plotlines shows how mature Pixar has become in creating compelling stories, and making movies that both kids and adults both enjoy.<br /><br />This is Pixar's best film to date (not that any of their previous movies have been anything less than outstanding), and it speaks to their remarkable talents that the 5-minute Presto short before the film is more entertaining that most live-action films have been this year. I think this is also Pixar's most technically advanced animation to date, in terms of simulating camera moves, lighting and art direction from live action science fiction.<br /><br />If you haven't see Wall-e already, this may be the best $15 you spend this year!<br /><br />(PS - As an aside, Ben Burtt is a very nice guy - the BURN-E noise is an electric shaver and the laser gun effects were made using a Slinky. :-))
B000006UNG|5.0|this is a great musical piece, and to my opinion the best of talk talk . romantic and emotional. pure music.
0618918248|3.0|I found this book to be a very interesting read. When the author remained on track with biological and other scientific arguments, the text flowed in a balanced, persuasive way. When Dawkins, however, strayed into excessive rallying for atheism, I thought he was protesting a bit too much. The book is well done, entertaining in parts, instructive in others. But, in the final analysis, I thought he waved the flag for the \\"cause\\" a bit too frenetically which, in my view, tended to diminish -- not his biological or even his sociobiological knowledge -- but his overall attempt to speak to those not in the choir.
1594201927|5.0|Ferguson deserved considerable credit in Colossus for suggesting that a reckoning was upon us.  In this book, written before the real calamity hit, he points to the assumptions that have been made leading to the crash.  It's plain that no there's no quick fix, that problems are deep, but not without precedent.  His breadth of erudition comes through as always but his voice as a writer has continued to strengthen.  He's smart, doesn't talk nonsense, and clearly articulates the false premises in our recent past and suggests what should change going forward.  A far better book than say, Bad Money - less Bush bashing, better focus on the longstanding issues.  Or Disaster Capitalism - which is so polemical.  Why not get the story from a professional academic?
B000MMN6YS|5.0|German born director Tom Tykwer slows things down quite a bit in PERFUME: THE STORY OF A MURDERER. Those in the know are probably aware of Tykwer's ultra-fast paced [[ASIN:B00103584Y Run Lola Run]](1998) in which the action never stopped. But here in Perfume we get to see a completely different Tykwer, one with an eye for beautiful camera shots, incredible vistas, and stunning cinematography.<br /><br />Problems with the film became apparent, however, before the film ever got green-lit. Several directors considered the project before opting out. Among them were such notables as Ridley Scott, Tim Burton, Martin Scorsese, Milos Forman, and even Stanley Kubrick (may he rest in peace). But fate - or karma or whatever you might believe in - intervened and plopped it in the lap of Mr. Tykwer, who quickly decided to make this feature event a spectacle beyond most imaginations. With an incredible budget of over $65 million (the largest ever from a German production company), the film was shot with an eye for artistic quality along with a flowing script. And it worked. It worked very well.<br /><br />The dark sets of 18th century France come alive (and frighteningly so) thanks to the shadowy sets and creepy main character of Jean-Baptiste Grenuille (Ben Whishaw, [[ASIN:B000IFQLG4 Layer Cake]]), a man with a gift for smells. Born to a careless and soon-to-be-dead mother, Jean-Baptiste's life is put under the microscope for the entire audience to see. Since being born on the streets of France (literally), Jean-Baptiste smells all of its greatness and stench. Being shuffled first to an orphanage where he fights for his infant life, to his life as a tanner, to his eventual acceptance into the business of a down-on-his-luck perfumer named Giuseppi Baldini (Dustin Hoffman, [[ASIN:B00168OINK Kung Fu Panda]]), Jean-Baptiste demands more and more from his marvelous sense of smell. In fact, he wants to be able to bottle the smell of glass and other intangibles. Maybe even capture the scent of ...life? Beauty? Oh yes, even that.<br /><br />During a visit to the streets of France, Jean-Baptiste encounters his first truly magnificent smell, that of a lovely redhead. But her fear of him leads to her death and Jean-Baptiste worries he may never get that scent back.<br /><br />His fears are side-stepped, however, when he learns how to capture the smell of beautiful women, but only after killing them. Dread grips the countryside as women of all socio-economic classes are found murdered.<br /><br />A man with an acute sense of danger named Richis (Alan Rickman, [[ASIN:B001BN1ZHW Sweeney Todd]]) realizes the danger his only daughter Laura (Rachel Hurd-Wood) is in and decides to flee with her across the country. But can distance save her when a human bloodhound is on your trail?<br /><br />Jean-Baptiste needs Laura in order to finish his scent de excellence and nothing appears to be able to stop him ...except for himself. His life has been a pursuit that no other person can share, and this has made him a truly lonely figure ...if not a non-entity in terms of humanity itself.<br /><br />This film came very close to being one of my top ten favorites, but fell a tad short thanks to what many call \\"the orgy scene.\\" Although it was a nice twist from what I thought was going to happen, it really, really, REALLY stretched the imagination beyond any possibility of realism. Even so, it was filmed exceptionally well.<br /><br />Most surprising to me was that I hadn't realized how long this sucker was. At nearly two-and-a-half hours, it whizzed by; that's how engrossing much of the production was, including the acting, the (amazing) sets and costumes, and the sumptuous cinematography (pay particular attention to the red hair, especially when Laura is fleeing on horseback with her father).<br /><br />I intend to buy this film and keep it in my DVD library.e?

B000IFS0HM|2.0|I read this story for a book club, and that sense of accountability was the main reason that I finished it.<br /><br />The McCourt family's life did not have to be so bad, and the children did not have to be malnourished.<br /><br />I know we have no right to judge others, but how could the parents keep spending what little they had on alcohol and cigarettes and give the babies sugar water to quiet them when they were hungry?  Didn't the children deserve some kind of priority?  Didn't this constitute child neglect?<br /><br />Some of the children did make it, but oh, things didn't have to be that bad.<br /><br />I must say, this book was depressing.  Although, more power to the author for ending up alright despite his childhood impoverishment and neglect.

B001G5ZKZS|4.0|All 3 of Rush's recent live DVDs (Rio, R30 and Snakes) are outstanding and worth owning.  It's simply amazing how guys their age can still put on as lengthy and energetic of a show as they do.  Whether buying a concert ticket or DVD package, you always get your money's worth.    From an audio standpoint, this new release is the best of the 3.  Just the 2-channel PCM mix blew me away with its clarity, balance and punch.  The picture is stunningly sharp, as good or better than R30.  There are plenty of cameras on hand to capture the band's brilliant stage set (love those descending lighting rigs).  A few too many S&A tunes strung together in set 2, but plenty of gems like \\"Witch Hunt\\" and \\"Bangkok\\" help balance it out.    The main problem with this DVD?  Editing.  It's good for the most part.  But there is one camera angle from crowd/floor level that the editor WAY overuses.  Frequently, this camera pans directly behind a row of heads in the audience, obscuring your view of the band on stage...sometimes even when Alex is soloing!  Once or twice during the show might not be so bad.  But as many times as it's done, it becomes distracting and highly annoying.  Seriously, I see the backs of peoples' heads enough when I'm AT the show; please leave that shot out of the DVD that people are paying $20+ for.  Also, the mix of shots is sometimes a little extreme.  One second, we're on a closeup of Geddy singing...the next second, we're in the very back of the hall and can only hear him singing.  I like active editing to a point, but this one occasionally jumps around too wildly at the wrong moments (R30 is superior from an editing standpoint; the bonus Atlanta clips are also better edited).  The closeups of the band playing though (when we get them for more than 2-3 seconds) are excellent, so like I said, it's good most of the time.
B0015XHP4K|2.0|The only reason this gets 2 stars is that First Blood is a decent movie.  The other two are horrid examples of sequels gone bad.  Putting them on BluRay is like putting lipstick on a pig.... No matter how red those lips get, it's still a pig.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This was perhaps the most entertaining movie or show I had seen in a long time. Wonderful!
B0010X745K|1.0|The movie was actually pretty good up until the last few minutes.  Before the ending, the movie was about struggling for survival and using everything you've got to protect the ones you love (yes, that includes not abandoning your own child to walk a woman home in monster filled mists).  The ending changes the message, making the moral of the story: sit on your [...] and if you aren't killed by the crazy religious nuts, random people will swoop in and rescue you.  As an added bonus, apparently will to survive only lasts for a couple of hours.  Then you just randomly give up.

1594481717|5.0|I am always looking for ways to be more productive. Being left-handed I became interested in this book when I saw the sub-title \\"Why Right-Brainers Will Rule The World\\". I thought: \\"finally, my day has come!\\".    What I found was not quite a \\"recipe book\\" for success but rather a new and different way to look at the world.    The book is replete with references to resource materials (many of which are found on the Internet free of cost). Now on my second reading I am taking the time to visit these resources to take my understanding of my fledgling new skill set to a deeper level.    When I really like a book I buy extras to give to friends.  Of the five extras that I bought I have given them to; a school superintendent, a financial services businessman, a nurse nearing retirement, a newspaper editor and an attorney.    If you want to learn what you will need to do differently or better to excel in our changing world this book is for you.
B001GKJ2E8|4.0|The '08 action/adventure `Wanted' is a totally unrealistic but thoroughly captivating, non-stop adrenaline rush that throws in a little subdued romance ala James McAvoy and Angelina Jolie. What really made this film for me was the cleverly constructed ongoing inner dialogue within the mind of former passive account manager now would-be-assassin Wesley Gibson (McAvoy) who finds himself in an underground world of trained killers known as \\"the Fraternity\\" who have been orchestrating the balance of power in the world for a thousand years. This interior conversation and analysis of life as Wesley perceives it is dark comedy at its best and adds a dimension to the story line that sets `Wanted' apart from most other films that fall within this genre.<br /><br />Another fascinating aspect of this film is the manner in which it subtly develops a more personal, intimate story within the context of the greater adventure drama exploding before the viewer. In an unexpected way Wesley Gibson's life story becomes a reflection of everyone's daily struggles, doubts and dreams. The financial hardships, the dead-end job, the harassing supervisor, the disloyal best friend and the dysfunctional romantic relationship all play their part in the unfolding drama and are important components in the evolution and maturation of the main character.<br /><br />`Wanted' succeeds in keeping the viewing audience entertained and focused despite the absurdity of many of the on-screen antics and will leave a smile on your face and maybe even elicit a chuckle or two at the very end. I love a movie that's willing to laugh at itself.
0765348276|4.0|I picked up a copy of \\"Old Man's War\\" last month and added it to a pile of books I intended to read before Christmas, needless to say one I started this fantastic tale I coudn't put it down. This one one great read, not a classic like Dune or LOTR, but OMW is one of those kinds of books that just grabs you and won't let go. Very well written with great, realistic characters and a story that could be all to real in our future.     A great mix of comedy, realism, and combat action, all from the perspective of an old man in a young mans body. I'm not usually sorry to reach the end of a book but with OMW I was left wanting more. Highly recomended.
0891419195|5.0|The late Mr Sledge 'hammer' wrote this compelling and often brutal account of his experiences during the grim and bloody battles on Peleliu and Okinawa. He was one of a scant handful of Marines that made it through both battles without a wound. His first hand account draws the reader into the daily routine of Marine life but also splashes mud and blood into your face when he lands on the two contested islands. Although a 60mm mortarman, he shared many of the same brutal conditions the infantry did: enemy snipers, artillery, personal misery, mud and incredible filth. Sledge writes in a straight forward style and a few times, he himself mentions that we was confused and puzzled about just where he was during advances and barrages, bringing this story to an even more personal level.<br />One of the best WWII related memoirs you will read, right up there with 'Storm of Steel' and 'Goodbye, Darkness'. Powerful, gripping, head-shaking and amazing are a few words to describe his experiences amid slashing shrapnel, Nambu bullets, artillery fire, carrying loads of ammo and hauling wounded Marines in knee-deep mud. Some scenes are horrific and brutal, just as they happened to him and his buddies. Well worth reading and you will not soon forget his book.<br />Sadly, Eugene Sledge passed away in 2001.

B001EOQWEO|5.0|Pixar has done it again, the love able Robot Wall-E can now be yours on DVD. I highly recommend this DVD, if you're a movie, disney, or pixar fan I definitely say buy the three disc DVD. The second disc of this edition contains some great special features not included on the single disc. \\"The Pixar Story\\" is an incredible documentary on the development and creation of this incredible animation studio.  This is a great DVD for all ages.

B000JLTRJ0|3.0|So I had seen this movie a while ago in theaters. I've always liked Oliver Stone films (i.e. Platoon, J.F.K, and Born on the Fourth of July). I thought that this film was a little under rated. Granted it's not his best, but is still one of Stone's better, recent films. The film has a lot of heart, and celebrates the American spirit on a day when it seemed like it was almost lost. A very moving, and touching film.

6305744793|4.0|Ever since I was a kid, I've really liked this movie. I also remember at the beginning of the movie when they show Thing walking, when I was a kid I thought Thing was gonna come out of the tv and get me. It has a really good storyline. Abigail Craven and Tully Alford plan to steal money from the Addams estate. They use Uncle Fester to go and steal it. Fester had lost his memory and doesn't know he's the 'real' Fester. Soon, Fester starts to feel like part of the family and doesn't want to go through the plan. I love how everyone in the family is gothic! Morticia is extremely sexy!  If you love the comics or tv series, you'll love THE ADDAMS FAMILY!!!
0066620996|4.0|The research behind this book is impressive and the theories are engaging.  On the whole, it's well written and it all makes good sense.  Most of these firms have done well over time, while some have not (e.g., Fannie May, Circuit City).  What Good to Great does not cover is the role of serendipity and changing market conditions.  Nor does it focus on customers.  You may want to check out Firms of Endearment for another perspective.

0385340990|4.0|I really enjoyed this book because of the history it presented.  The characters were delightful. A very enjoyable read. I had no idea that the channel islands (off England's coast) were so isolated during WW2, nor that the German's had taken it over.  There were many surprises and several quirky little stories to delight the reader.
0446528056|5.0|Great character building. Story pulls the reader in throughout the entire book. Best book I've read in a long time.

B0013FSL3E|4.0|Wall-E is as good as anything Pixar has done to date, even if it lacks the subtlety of previous pictures.  The characters are memorable and adorable and the story is appealing to tots and parents alike.

B00004STPT|4.0|Wonderful soundtrack.  You can definitely hear Klaus Badelt (Pirates of the Caribbean)in some of the tracks - so much so that it sounds a little \\"pirate-y\\".  Badelt co-produced this with Zimmer and did some additional music and arranging.  Interesting list of names in the thank you list: includes Harry Gregson-Williams (Narnia soundtracks) and John Powell (Bourne soundtracks).  You can't lose with Zimmer.

1564148793|5.0|I enjoyed this book. Jason Miller lives in the real world, a world where a good deed and intention is often not enough to keep one from harm. In his book he describes many techniques from various well researched and cited sources ranging from classic to modern magickal thought and theory.<br />The techniques presented are easy to understand and are written in a conversational tone. His style of magick is eclectic to the point of almost being Chaos inspired. I recognized many of the sources he cited and was introduced to new ways of thought on protection and reversal magicks.<br />Though he works primarily with Hekate the rituals presented are easily adapted to your own needs and trads. I can hardly wait to see his next book as hinted in this one.<br />My favorite quote from this book is: \\"Okay, so it's a comic book series. If  you can't get around that, then you won't understand Chaos Magick.\\"<br />I highly recommend this book to practitioner who wants a thorough investigation into a technique that has been largely untouched many occult writers.
B001M6KTLG|4.0|I liked this movie but I bought it for my wife who still has a crush on Harrison Ford even at his advanced age.  The characters in this movie are diferent but the plot is about the same as all of the other Indiana Jones movies.  Unfortunately, there are no real surprises left in this long runing series.  However, if you have the other 3 movies, this one is a must to complete your collection.
1433502410|3.0|It just plain ok.....  You don't need to rush out and by it like I did.    With all the hype from Mark Driscoll and John Piper,  with big name editors like Packer and Grudem, I was expecting  something stunning....    Not just fancy paper and typefaces and illustrations, I was  expecting a theological hurricane and all I just was a light drizzle.  The notes are vague and vanilla. It is bigger than it needs to be.    I would get the Reformation study bible (ESV) or Spirit of the Reformation (NIV) to get some clear direction in the text from a historical point of view.
0930289234|5.0|This graphic novel is unparalleled by other works in the medium.  The psychological profiles of the characters are deep, the story is intricate, and the art is spectacular!  It brings up issues of right and wrong, black and white, the greater good.  No other graphic novel is this deep or well written!  The book is, however, fairly dark and not very appropriate for younger readers.
B0017XOF5A|4.0|Seeing on Blu-Ray was worth it. As others have indicated, this movie was enjoyable for true fans of the show. Seeing the entire cast back together felt right as did the level of the story for a semi-wrapup of the Bal story arc.  I liked the extra feature about the onsite shoting in the artic.

B001GKJ2DY|5.0|This movie was about the most fun I have had in a long time.. I was not an ABBA fan, I was into Country music in the 80's, but this music is so bubbily that you can't help but enjoy it!  I came out of the theatre so happy!   It does have some adult jokes, I attended the movie with all women in their 40's-50's (my hubby tagged along also) we all enjoyed it, even the hubby! The jokes were not appropiate for young teenagers but funny for us. I would have felt uncomfortable to watch it with a younger teenager.  Overall though the movie was a lot of fun!!!
B001ED7C58|4.0|The \\"Twilight\\" CD is an excellent companion to a great film, and also a great stand-alone collection of music. The songs are a mix of electronic/indie/alternative rock, and for the most part, they're all pretty fantastic. Highlights include the pulsating \\"Supermassive Black Hole,\\" the powerful \\"Decode,\\" and the gentle \\"Flightless Bird, American Mouth.\\" I was also pleased to discover that the theme \\"Bella's Lullaby,\\" my favorite melody from the \\"Twilight\\" score, is included on the soundtrack as well. I am very pleased with this CD.
0307269752|3.0|The story plot has been summarized in many reviews so I won't recap. Mysteries and bestsellers and mystery-bestsellers are not my favorite. For me, it is problematic in these two regards: 1) about two-thirds through the book there is no mystery. Some implausible event / occurrence /conversation happens that is there specifically to drive the story forward. I can spot it right away and it takes me out of the story. And, 2) the villains are the villains. No subtlety, no subtext.<br /><br />This book is predictable in that fashion. One more thing, it feels a little bit 'dated' because it's 2002 or perhaps that's the translation.<br /><br />Still, in spite of those detractions, it's a pretty entertaining read with a definite has narrative drive.  There are some interesting tidbits about Scandinavian society, misogyny, corporate evil. Read it for that if not the mystery part.<br /><br />There are two mysteries that are my gold standard in that each was completely entertaining from page 1 to the end: Smillas Sense of Snow by Peter Hoeg and Conspiracy of Paper by David Liss. If you've read either of these two books and agree that those are 5 star, then this would rank as a 3 star.
1595141979|5.0|Grrrr!  It is so frustrating to be in the middle of such an absolutely amazing series and have to wait for the next book to come out.  Hat's off to Richelle Mead because she does a fantastic job of making her worlds and characters so realistic that I feel torn apart when I am removed from them.  This story is filled with adrenaline pumping action.  It was literally not possible to put the book down.  I stayed up till 2:00 in the morning so that I could finish it.  On a work night.  Even so the next morning I woke up and all I could think about was the book.  I reread certain parts over and over, trying to suck the marrow out of the story.  Rose is really growing up, becoming more of a woman and less of a teen in each and every book.  I love to try to predict where stories are headed, and I am usually right, but Richelle Mead always seems to throw me for a loop.  Please read this book, and well, this series if you are at all a fan of adventure, romance, fantasy and fun.
B001FOPODS|5.0|\\"Peter And The Wolf\\" (2008)<br />Technically stunning, and thematically dark, this amazing adaptation of Sergei Prokoviev's classic children's piece, features marvelous stop-motion animation from director Suzie Templeton.<br /><br />The film places \\"Peter\\" squarely back into its Russian origins, but rather than an idealized rural-agrarian past, it places the story in a more modern setting, amid glum, drab, rundown shacks and tattered forests, a grim vision of a Soviet-era or post-Soviet Eastern Europe, complete with gun-toting thugs (the hunters of the original story here seem more like cold-hearted militiamen) and the nearby village appears as a rundown, dismal cinderblock outpost. Amid this crushing gloom, Peter finds wonder and joy, unlocking a secret garden where he and his friends the bird and the duck (both crippled and unable to fly) are able to play and forget the bleakness around them.<br /><br />While this may sound a bit miserable, the film itself is a marvel: the amount of work that went into this film is amazing, with Templeton devoting a full five years of her life to completing the piece. Equally engrossing are the added special features, including a making-of video and interview with Templeton and her cohorts that gives a sense of the sheer scope of their project, and the level of detail that went into this production. While the film itself may be a bit dark for smaller children, it will enthrall older kids and adults alike... This is a real class act, a film worth having and viewing for years to come.  Recommended!  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)
0385512058|5.0|Keith Ferrazzi takes networking to a whole new level of interpersonal relationships.  A lot of the concepts in this book are reiterated from books written in the past about networking.  Every time I read the same concepts from other authors I am more opt to put what I've read and learned into action.  There are techniques that he uses that I don't think I would try but there are more ideas in this book that opens your eyes to explain why he's so successful at what he does.  This book isn't the fastest read but a lot of the stories and personal experience are touching and worth reading.
0316017922|3.0|I'm a big Malcolm Gladwell fan. I think his research and writing skills are sublime; however, in Outliers, a book about about men and women who do things that are out of the ordinary, he gets carried away.<br /><br />While his objective was to have Outliers do for our understanding of success, what Stewart Wolf did for our understanding of health (closely examining personal choices or actions in isolation by looking beyond the individual), he delves far too deep in his supporting content to make a point (e.g. The Three Lessons Of Joe Flom and especially The Ethinic Theory of Plane Crashes).<br /><br />Unlike The Tipping Point, one has to sift through Outliers to find the extractable and relevant content that can be applied to your life. This is not say that it isn't there; Malcolm Gladwell always delivers in that regard, but in this book the delivery is slow in comparison to his previous works.<br /><br />Some of the book highlights include information on divergence and convergence tests; backgrounds of Bill Joy and Bill Gates; Lewis Terman's Termites; Annette Lareau's concerted cultivation and intensive scheduling; Robert Sternberg's practical intelligence; accumulated advantages; the reasons why students from Japan, South Korea, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan score in the ninety-eighth percentile in math in comparison to other Western industrialized nations that rank between twenty-six and thirty-six; and the 10,000 hour rule. These topics alone make this book worth having, but you could probably conduct independent research on your own via Google to get in-depth information on these people and subjects.<br /><br />The message of Outliers - in the words of Malcolm Gladwell - is that people don't rise from nothing. It makes a difference where and when we grew up. The cultures we belong to, the legacies we were passed down by our forebears shape the patterns of our achievement in ways that we can not imagine. No one - not rock stars, not professional athletes, not software billionaires, and not even geniuses - ever makes it alone.<br /><br />Ironically, that's why I purchased Outliers; I wanted my favorite researcher to expand upon the ingredients of success in ways that I could not imagine. In the end, Malcolm Gladwell's sprawling thoughts are enlightening and sometimes inspiring, but overall it lacks the coherence and impact that normally characterize his books.and not even geniuses - ever makes it alone.

B00007K02F|1.0|(Spoiler alert) I recently read \\"Jane Eyre\\" and was very excited about watching the several film adaptations of this most wonderful book.  I am very disappointed with this version of the film (Hurt & Gainesbourg), so much so that I have not yet tried to watch any of the others.  Having read the book so near to the time that I watched the film, I was aghast that so much of the story was ignored!  Jane's time spent between leaving Thornfield and going back to Mr. Rochester was COMPLETELY skipped over.  Much of her childhood was likewise left out.  The cruelty that Jane experienced at the hands of her aunt and cousins was only briefly touched upon, and hardly any attention was given to the relationships she cultivated at Lowood School.  Perhaps most diappointing, the relationship between Jane and Mr. Rochester was hardly developed at all.  There were no moments when the viewer felt an unspoken yearning or tension between them that would foreshadow their union.  There was simply nothing going on between the two characters that would hint at love or interest in each other, making the proposal scene (a very beautiful scene in the book!) very, very lackluster.  Furthermore, the actors, in my opinion, did not truly portray the characters as they were written.  While young Anna Paquin is quite talented, I don't feel that she gave the best portrayal of young Jane (this is probably the fault of those who counseled the actress), because she portrayed Jane as insolent, sullen, and mouthy.  The child Jane in the book is none of those things.  Charlotte Gainesbourg gave a fair performance as the adult Jane.  But, as much as I admire William Hurt's performances in his countless other roles, he was simply NOT Mr. Rochester.  Hurt displayed none of the dark brooding and sharp wit that the Mr. Rochester in the book displayed.  This adaptation is very disappointing, and I would urge those who love the story to choose another means in which to waste 2 hours.
B0018RWD1S|5.0|While Back To Black shot Amy into superstardom, her jazzier 2003 debut Frank is the superior album. Don't get me wrong. Black is one of the best albums out there, but her voice had more agility back in the day and the production on her debut was retro yet modern.<br /><br />The second disc of the deluxe edition includes demos, some remixes of songs on the first disc, and a few jazz standard covers. The woozy cover of Round Midnight is intoxicating as well as Fools Gold (an original demo), Teach Me Tonight, and Someone To Watch Over Me. The live version of Take The Box proves that Amy's voice used to have such power that could rival Christina Aguilera's. Great remix of In My Bed too (CJ Mix)! More B-sides like Do Me Good and Procrastination would've been nice since the demos and live versions of certain songs got repetitive, but it's a small complaint. Can't wait for some new material, Amy!
B001GQACGO|2.0|B'Day was MUCH better than this album. Disc 1 has a few slow songs like \\"Halo\\" and \\"Disappear\\" that are good, the others are irrelevant, and I don't see how \\"If I Were A Boy\\" related to her in any way, shape, or form, especially since she's married to Jay Z. I'm sure he never treated her like that. I like when artists sing/rap about actual true life experiences that we know about, that makes the song more real and personal. (for instance Britney Spears and the \\"Blackout\\" album..). Not saying Beyonce has never been through anything, but I feel like the song would have been sung more passionately and more deep had it just been \\"more real\\". I feel like she's tryin to speak for the other women out there who have been through things like that..<br /><br />Disc 2 (which is pointless to have 2 of them...what a waste of money), has \\"Single Ladies\\" and \\"Hello\\", the others ones??? [...] I'm not sure what's going on but they don't sound like something Beyonce/Sasha would sing ever. I think she tried a little too hard on this one... keep letting The Dream and Ne-Yo do their jobs with the song writing..please!!!
B00139W3NE|5.0|The Golden Compass is a great film that is based upon a awesome book trilogy. This film stars Nicole Kidman, Sam Elliot, Ian McKellen, Dakota Blue Richards, Daniel Craig, Philip Pullman, and Ian McShane.    While some of you may disagree with me, I liked this movie better than Narnia. There is supposed to be a sequel coming out 2009 and I can't wait to see it! Though there is some protests against a sequel (mainly the people of the Catholic Church), but I doubt that those \\"highly\\" religious people will stop the making of the sequel.    With a great story, special effects, and actors & actresses, The Golden Compass will eventually become an instant classic. I suggest anyone who wants to be entertained to buy this DVD. It's affordable and entertaining.    Either way, you always get your moneys worth in the end.
0446579939|4.0|Nicholas Sparks has written another hard to put down page turner.  The concept of a Marine in Iraq finding a photo of a woman, considering it a good luck charm and seeking her out in person is intriguing.   We know before they even meet that Logan will fall in love with her; after all, Sparks female protagonists are all \\"extraordinarily beautiful in a natural way with no real major character flaws.\\" I didn't buy it that he walked all the way from Colorado.  That seems borderline to me. It would have been more believable if he had started out from, say Alabama, or would have picked up an old junker to drive from Colorado. I can buy the obsession with looking for her but not the walking cross country bit. The zany Nana gets a bit too much as do the constantly repetitious times Ben and Zeus play together (does this kid ever have homework?) This story has a lot of parallels with an earlier Sparks novel \\"The Guardian\\" (the lovable dog, the evil antigonist). I liked the alternating chapters based on the viewpoint of Thibault, Beth and Clayton. All in all a good read, not just for women but for men too.
0765316897|5.0|Sanderson set up some far-reaching challenges for himself and his readers with the first two Mistborn novels, and he meets every one of them in this spectacular finale!    The entire saga is creative, intelligent, complex, profound, consistent, and amazingly fun! The denouement is artfully paced--the unravelling of each secret at the end of the book as well as the revelation of each twist are not simply dumped upon the reader's head nor are they stretched out to the point of boring us. The first two books are wonderful, and the third of the trilogy is the perfect capstone.    As with the preceding two books, I love the unique magic system. The cinematic storytelling brings it to life beautifully and adds intensity to the action scenes.    Here's hoping the author maintains his quick publishing pace so we don't have to wait too long for more of his excellent work!
B00068TJM6|5.0|This watch is the best value for the price. Its size and weight are ideal. It has the feel of a Breitling or Rolex and gets just as much attention. I've had the watch for less than a week and I have been turning heads every where I go. People have been asking me where I purchased the watch or how much did it cost. Since it is reasonably priced I am reluctant to tell them since it is easily accessible and I do not want people that I know with the same watch as myself. I would highly recommend this watch to anyone who has an ounce of style or class when it comes to their wrist wear. The different functions, I must admit are not necessary for me on a daily basis and I will probably never use anything except the alarm (maybe). But the gauges are cool to have. All in all it is an exceptional piece, all I need is a G5 to match!!
B00000K0EA|2.0|The final half hour is an overwrought shoot out aboard a stealth craft that is too long by 25 minutes. Nothing happens except a lot of fake bullets fly endlessly. Otherwise, the plot, thinly disguised as a spoof on Rupert Murdoch, involves the usual megalomaniac -in this case, a media mogul - bent on creating world havoc for his own gain. Brosnan is cool in the early going, and the opener, involving an arms bazaar and a nuclear bomb carrying jet fighter is great, as usual with Bond films. The story line overall is just so-so. The title track by Sheryl Crowe is one of the better Bonds.

B0011ZNAIC|1.0|I guess I watch more kids movies now because I am a parent. It has opened my eyes to the fact that most kids are propaganda movies forged to give kids political/social views before they're old enough to really understand such things. If you were to watch Bee Movie you would see what I mean. It will explain to you everything that's wrong with our country. I suggest you watch it under the heading of \\"How far America has declined.\\" I like the part where the bees explicitly blame white people for oppressing them. Or the parts where the bleeding heart liberal woman makes her husband out to be a jerk because he tries to kill a little harmless bee. Yes, I thoroughly enjoyed this propaganda movie.
B000654YRY|4.0|Dire Straits is an amazingly synergistic band, led in subtle ways by superb guitarist, composer and musician Mark Knopfler.  Though primarily a rock band with lots of electric guitar, there are quieter and deeply moving parts as well.  Overall, it is very musically diverse and interesting.  The show itself, lights and effects, is remarkably well done with professional, tasteful, artistic camera work through out.  Well worth adding to your musical video collection.
B001ECQ6YW|3.0|I like this movie and thus bought this DVD. But the DVD case looks pretty cheap, which made me wondering if I over paid for it.
031606792X|2.0|I gave the book two stars because the author knows how to write and how to entice a young audience by using \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" for her outline, but other than that, the series is all fluff and doesn't even include accurate information. For instance, who ever heard of an elk bull (not buck--that's deer) with two dozen points (and they're tines, not antlers)? Unbelievable! Someone needs to do a bit of research before they write stuff like that. Since it's a fantasy romance series, it really doesn't matter whether or not an imaginary vampire can impregnate the main character, etc., but at least the author should get real facts straight.    Other than that, everything in the story is predictable, the main character is so stupid, whiny and fragile that you want to slap her, and like other people mentioned, there's really no appeal to her whatsoever, so why would the other characters in the story find her so alluring? I hope teenage girls are smarter than this and don't look to this character as a hero.     The sad thing is that teenagers will infer from the book that people are liked because of their looks and not because they are of strong character or because they can communicate effectively with others. The lack of communication within relationships in the story was quite disturbing, but apparently that's why romances sell so well.
0956010903|5.0|Holy flying bludgers Harry!  If you even remotely consider yourself a Potter fan then this is a must for you.  Besides the fact that it has collectors prints of some of the hand drawn art from Jo and looks like the 7 original versions that she wrote (don't worry though only the intro is hand written) this is a wonderful, heirloom quality book.  I have a feeling I'll be reading these stories to my kids when I have them.  I will cherish this edition as long as I live.  Plus you get a warm, fuzzy feeling knowing that the money is going to a great cause, the Children's High Level Group.
B000SO7OLQ|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised at how good this cd is. It's full of tasty riffs, speedy arrangements and time changes galore. The production is suitably 80's Thrash which only adds to its charm. The band know their business and are a chaotic/tight unit. It reminded me of Exodus, Kreator, Anthrax, Megadeth and bands like Hallow's Eve in their heyday. Fueled By Fire are great.
0545128285|5.0|For many years I have enjoyed Beedle the Bard and wished I could share it with my muggle friends. Unfortunately, as I was in the possession of a special edition that had been handed down through my family complete with moving drawings I couldn't share it. So it was with great delight that I went into a muggle bookstore to purchase a perfectly non-magical version for my friends. The cover has a nice soft feel with splendid illustrations. Inside, there is an introduction by J.K. Rowling and seventeen illustrations draw by her too. Each chapter is accompanied by a commentary written the late and beloved Albus Dumbledore. The font is the same as in the Harry Potter series that muggles have grown to love so much. J.K. Rowling has also kindly saved me from explaining various terms such as 'squib' to my muggle friends by putting foot notes under Albus Dumbledore's work. As for the actual stories, they need no explaining. Each one is just like my own book and all wizarding children will recognize them with glee. But as Beatrice Bloxam will tell you, they can be very gory at times and not always suitable for the youngest crowds. Most of the stories do not end happily ever after.  Overall, I am very happy with this edition of a favorite book and I am glad to share such wonderful stories with muggles and wizards alike.
B001GQSY5U|2.0|I've spent hours in line waiting to see the various Star Wars franchise films.  While \\"Clone Wars\\" filled in some gaps in the history, the film has several fatal flaws.    The war's between the Republic and the Separatists.  The Republic, led by Kenobi and Skywalker, are trying to rescue Republic forces trapped by the Separatist clone army. They are also trying to rescue Jabba the Hutt's kidnapped son to form an alliance with the Hutt Tribe.     I enjoyed the characterization, particularly the introduction of a female Jedi Knight.  Ahsoka (voiced by Ashley Eckstein) is the typical mismatched pair with Anakin (voiced by Matt Lanter).     I've got a few major complaints. First, John Williams' music is gone.  The opening narrative just wasn't in line with the pyramid shaped crawl the other films start with.     Second, the CGI animation was stellar in places and dreadful in others.  If they can make a spaceship look real enough to look like regular film in places, they can remove the jagged edges from the character's faces and give them more than molded hairstyles.  Kenobi's beard looked more like an Egyptian carving.     Finally, the clones weren't an enemy.  They were more like a clown force.  Their interaction made the whole story more or less pointless.     On the other hand, the cartoon network show is great.    That works, the movie just doesn't.     Rebecca Kyle, December 2008
0439023483|4.0|This book is geared towards young adults, but I was so intrigued with the plot that I decided to read it myself (I'm 30).  One of my favorite short stories is \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\" and I felt this book embraced a lot of its ideas.  The story takes place in the future under a totalitarian regime that rules with fear.  The Hunger Games are an annual event that pins teens against each other as they fight till their death until there is only 1 survivor.  The book follows the main character, Katniss, and her journey to stay alive.  I recommend this book not only to adolescents, but adults as well.  It's a provocative story line that will keep your interest.
B000Q6GUTI|4.0|The film opens with two US troops being abandoned by their commander. They are not in authorized space.  When asked why, the commander said something to the effect that the men were well trained and they would find their way home.    We know one of them did, because we see him years later.  Bob Lee Swagger (Wahlberg) has nearly gone off the grid.  It's just him and his dog living in a remote cabin.     When he's approached by Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover) to help foil a plot to kill the US President by determining how the shooter is going to do it, he reluctantly accepts the job.      When the fated day arrives, it's actually the Archbishop of Ethiopia who is shot and the crime's blamed on Swagger.  Swagger goes on the run, trying to find out precisely what happened.     \\"Shooter\\" is a smart paced and intelligent conspiracy thriller taken from the pen of Stephen Hunter. Excellent acting on the part of the whole crew.  This multi-faceted film is well worth owning.  You will want to see it again.     Rebecca Kyle, December 2008
B00000JPH6|5.0|AWESOME collector for the generation who grew up with the Muppets, no doubt.... However, this movie may need to be carefully reviewed by parents before young children watch it.  I was born in 1979, very young when The Dark Crystal was big. My mother watched EVERYTHING before she let me view any movie or TV show to understand the point that was trying to be made and whether she felt the subject matter was appropriate for me. (This is what parents SHOULD do). Instead of just thinking, 'Oh, Muppets... Jim Henson... Must be OK for her to watch,' she previewed it and was surprised by the angle of the film. Well, the angle of the Skeksis (sp.) anyway.   The idea of sucking out 'The Essence' of small, inferior creatures to maintain life and youth was a message my mother didn't want me to be exposed to. Now that I'm an adult, I don't believe I would want my kids to see the movie at a very young age for the same reason. Plus too, that part of the movie is kind of scary, you have to see it to know what I mean.  I don't take a single bit of credability away from Mr. Henson and his group. For that time, they did a tremendous job on the production of this film, considering what we know today about special effects and so on.  I love this movie, I recommend it to anyone ages 15 and up. And parents, PLEASE monitor what your children are viewing and use the ratings system, but most importantly, use your best judgement on what you feel you want your children to learn from the media. PLEASE WATCH RESPONSIBLY!!! May you rest in peace, Jim. You made my childhood a memorable one!
0956010903|5.0|I am shocked at the incredible awesomeness of this collector's edition!  I am actually jealous of my daughter because it is a gift for her.  I had to open it, ummmmm, just to make sure all the parts were there!  Yeah, that's why!  I wish so very badly that they had these kinds of things when I was younger.  For any fan of the Harry Potter series this is an absolute must have!  It is a true treasure!  Well worth the $100.  I got $100 worth of entertainment just opening the box and looking at it.  The actual stories are just a bonus!
B000HIVOI2|1.0|I bought the blu-ray edition of the movie and was blown-away at how horrible the picture looked.  I'm not sure how they transferred the film to digital but the blu-ray looks worse than DVD copies of the film I've seen.  You'll be looking at the TV wondering if its on the fritz becuase there's so much snow and artifacts in the picture - and no I don't mean archeological artifacts either.  Avoid the blu-ray version!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|True Blood is an absolutely compelling show.  Well writtten and well cast it is truly a seductive thrill.  Through the years I have always been fascinated by vampires...starting with Dracula.  True Blood has all of the elements that keep one involved.

0345495004|4.0|The book is a well written historical novel. Although it is fictional, the story appears to be thoroughly researched and documented. Based on this documentation, including letters, newspaper articles, etc., the author presents an intimate picture of Wright's relationship with his Soul Mate, Mamah Borthwick Cheney. Wright is so passionate and focused on his work and career success, that it is surprising to see how much he cares for Mamah.   This account of the lives of two intelligent and very conscious people is told from Mamah's heart and not from Wright's perspective. Their \\"affair\\" is tabloid fodder and out of sync with the social and moral double standards of the era in which they lived. Inspite of this continual pressure, Frank and Mamah try to live their lives based on their own strong beliefs and desires.   The novel is a unique historical snapshot of the most moving events in the lives of two people who are bound together in a complex, multi-layered relationship. Although Wright went on to have other affairs and marriages, his final request was to be buried next to Mamah.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie & the soundtrack is excellent. I couldn't wait to buy this cd. There's lots of great songs on it, my absolute favorite is 'Go All the Way' by Perry Farrell - I'm playing it over & over again...I also love 'Tremble for my Beloved' by Collective Soul (been a fan of theirs since their very first album), I love 'Supermassive Black Hole' by Muse, and a delightful surprise is the songs by Rob Pattinson (Twilight's sexy vampire lead) - 'Never Think' & 'Let Me Sign' - he has a fantastic voice & a wonderful musicality. I look very forward to hearing more of his music. I highly recommend the soundtrack, it's got a great variety of songs, I love pretty much all of them, and it's a cd that you can listen to over & over again...<br /><br />Rai Aren

0385491026|5.0|Warning: my review has spoilerish parts. I didn't know how to express myself without hinting at them, sorry.<br /><br />There is no torture more harrowing than the psychological torture inflicted upon little girls by each other. What adults see as children playing is, to a young girl, a cruel circle of social politics that, even years later, we as women look back upon with varying amounts of pain. In Cat's Eye, the main character, Elaine describes how her disturbing relationship with her best \\"friends\\" affects her thinking as a mature adult.<br /><br />This is the second Margaret Atwood novel I have read, and like the first one (The Handmaid's Tale), I couldn't put it down. It is not a pleasant novel to read; it left me with a lump in my throat. It brought back the feelings of shame and loss of control I myself had as a 13-year-old; the aching memories of being bullied in the 7th grade, by the girls I now realize were themselves sad and abused.<br /><br />Elaine is not a hero, but a survivor. She does not tell the story with the purpose of being admired (actually, there were times when I wished I could reach into the book and smack her). She is more of a character to be understood and related to. She tells her story in increments, going back and forth between her life as an adult and her life as a child.<br /><br />Cordelia, the ringleader of Elaine's social circle, is also very complicated character. Reading her interactions with Elaine really hit home. It is hard for anyone to read this book and NOT realize that they, too, have either known a Cordelia or been a Cordelia- or both. Elaine's fear of her is palpable and understandable. Yet, in a character that could easily be portrayed as one- dimensional, Atwood has created her in a way that you can see, even through the evil, the pain that lies just beneath Cordelia's exterior. Cordelia gets hers, eventually, but I don't see that as a great victory.<br /><br />I'm not sure whether or not the ending was a happy one. Rather, I think it was more true to life.... the story itself is a series of Elaine's victories and failures. In the end, the overwhelming feeling that I had was of loss, for Elaine and Cordelia's happy end.life.... the story itself is a series of Elaine's victories and failures.

B001C46P2A|4.0|saw australia over thanksgiving weekend.   liked it but not quite raving over it.      australia is sort of self-conscious and manipulative, with formulaic plot -- civilized woman adjusts to wild land and tames wild man and he tames her and together they battle the bad guys and keep the farm.  it milks sympathy for little smiling aboriginal kid (who is a good actor and scene stealer, btw) and brings home the history of the racial issues that australia faced.  it tries to sweep audience off its feet with big love story and nature scenes.   a modern aussie western and war flick all rolled into one.    movie shamelessly draws on GWTW and the wizard of oz (ironic given australia's nickname), both out in 1939, when movie starts, it takes place from 1939 until december of 1941.   shows sweeping vistas of australian outback, cliffs, waterfalls, and dusty cattle stations. and big final scene, japanese air attack   on darwin, which followed pearl harbor, is a spectacular and loud finish.     hugh jackman's main function in flick is to take off his shirt and bare his pecs and abs.   unfortunately, that is not nicole kidman's.   she plays \\"lady ashley\\" a \\"fiercely independent\\" spunky brit with beaucoup baggage full of unmentionables far from home, come to mind her late husband's cattle station.   hugh plays \\"the drover,\\" whom \\"nobody hires and nobody fires\\" until he meets you know who and helps her realize she doesn't need all those unmentionables down under (sorry for that one...).       they had pretty good, not great, chemistry; have commented on hugh's buffness, and nicole is as tall and thin as olive oyl, though, and seems to want to be known as a serious actress, even when the scene calls for her to be funny.   jane seymour is more my idea of what lady ashley ought to be, but she ain't an aussie, so nicole it is.    i recommend australia and give it four stars.  it is worth seeing even though it probably won't go down in history as another GWTW    see it in a theatre rather than renting it and watching it on a smaller tv if you can.
B000KRNCYY|4.0|Ordered this CD on a preview of the \\"Spanish Woman\\" track. Oops..    Spanish woman was my favourite from the DVD. Why would they not put it on this CD, and why don't they mention that it does not include all tracks?
1401300529|4.0|This book is not so much a history of the Korean War but more a meditation of the role of the war in the development of America's response to the cold war. There is a outline of the operations of the war but most of the narrative deals with the early battles and China's intervention. The last two years of the war are dealt with very briefly indicating that the Americans were able to develop tactics to use their superior firepower to turn the conflict into a draw.     The attraction of the book is that it deals with the historical context better than previous narratives and looks at the American response as something which was flexible rather than fixed and unchanging. It was in response to the Korean war that containment became working strategy of the cold war rather than roll back.     Halberstam sees the war as a disaster for the Democratic Party. The war seemed won after McArthur's landing at Inchon, but the American advance to the Chinese border that seemed to be able to achieve the liberation of the north failed. The Chinese counter attacked the strung out UN troops inflicting a huge initial defeat. This on top of the victory of Mao in China meant that the right wing of the Republican Party was able to tar the Democrats as poor, possibly traitorous defenders of the free world.     The problems of the Democrats was worsened by the actions of McArthur the highly egocentric theatre commander. After General Ridgeway was able to stabilize the UN front and to start inflicting very significant losses on the Chinese McArthur seemed to become jealous and unhinged. He started to call for an all out war against China and suggesting that the Truman administration was cheating the American people of a potential chance to roll back communism in China. Eventually he was sacked by Truman.  Not only did Truman seem to have lost China and overseen a huge initial American defeat but he then ended up sacking a national hero. McArthur then attempted to position himself to run for the presidency but things fell apart following his evidence to a Senate inquiry when he revealed himself as an unrepentant idiot.      Halberstam is an admirer of Eisehower and sees him as being a moderate voice that was able to govern the Republicans from the centre and to set in train a response to communism that was rational and measured. When the Democrats again won power under Kennedy they felt that they had to re-fight the battles of the Korean war and show that they were not soft on communism. The Vietnam War arose as a public relations demonstration that the Democrats were not foreign policy push overs rather than a measured examination of the situation on the ground.     At the time the elephant in the room was of course that America decided to fight a full scale conventional war against China. Yet in those days this was never acknowledged or talked about. The discussion was about fighting the North Koreans and supporting Chinese volunteers. Part of the confusion was of course that \\"China\\" to the Americans at the time was the Nationalist regime which only controlled Formosa. The enemy was not even recognised as an official entity.     Eisenhower was nothing if not a person who had an open mind and could think. His conclusion from the Korean war was that the US fought under considerable disadvantage. Communication and supply were difficult for the US. Asian powers had large populations which meant that they could fight wars of attrition. He thus formed the view that the US should not involve itself in Asian ground wars. The Vietnam was being a war when one side was able to suffer immense losses of manpower but to continue fighting an attritiononal war that was eventually successful.
B000BVEKO0|5.0|After listening to this CD the first time I only liked about 3 songs. The singles and \\"politics\\". I love every song on this album. The first 3 tracks on the bonus disc are awesome as well. The CD is great. Guitars are powerful and drums are awesome as well. Favorite tracks: Liar, Hyporcites, Open up, and politics. These were probably the tracks I liked first. The bonus disc is awesome I don't like the Twisted Transistor remixes but the other songs are AWESOME.

This young group is talented, vibrant and mature including social issues such as child sexual abuse as a cause is just very heart-warming. DVD with behind the scene is well done. Music and lyrics are excellent.

0307387178|3.0|An intriguing and thought provoking read. This book is more than just a biography or epilogue on the life of Chris McCandless. The author does a great job of tracing the last 2 years of McCandless' life while also setting other examples of man vs. wild at counterpoint.    Writing Style  Krakauer has a fabulous eye for detail, a great vocabulary, and his writing shows an intense passion for the outdoors. The descriptions of places, people and events were so vivid and engrossing that I feel as though I have a personal familiarity with many of the locations and events portrayed in the novel.    Even though Krakauer obviously has some of his own opinions and thoughts about the events, he did a fairly good job of presenting the work without too much intrusion of authorial bias. Actually, I felt that having Krakauer as author and narrator actually brought more to the story through his personal insights and bias. If the story was truly told by an absolutely non-biased author or by an author less passionately involved in the wilderness, I believe a lot would have been lost.    I also really enjoyed the use of quotations at the beginning of each chapter. Some of the quotations were pulled from passages found with McCandless while others were likely researched and input by Krakauer to add emphasis to his narrative.    Voice & Narrative  Krakauer's narrative voice was subtle and accessible and provided an excellent unobtrusive narrator for the course of the book. His passion for the outdoors in general and for hiking in particular was evident, especially in the chapters he devoted to his own experience.    At first I was taken slightly aback at the author's biographical interruption with his own climbing experience. On one hand, it felt somewhat egoistical to place himself in the same category as the numerous other anecdotal stories he had cited. As I thought more about it, however, it felt perfectly natural that he include his own experience. Firstly because the experience was just as good a parallel as any of the other stories he had researched and shared. Secondly, because it did expose the authorial bias that Krakauer did have towards McCandless and explained exactly how it was that the author truly could and did relate to the subject.    The Story  While there may have been times that Krakauer imposed some bits of fiction into the biography, he tries hard to present all of his writing either as fact based on findings or research or as his own opinion and he is careful to identify passages that are his opinion rather than documented fact. In a story such as this, there are times when educated opinions are the best we can hope for, and I think Krakauer presents himself as a viable source for potentially valid opinions.    While the central focus of the story is the last two years of Chris McCandless' life, that is not entirely the heart of the message.    As I started reading, I didn't know much about McCandless other than that he hiked out into Alaska and was found dead a few months later. I'd read some Jack London in High School, but even then, I wasn't entirely sure how this story was going to become a full book. It was exciting to find that the book explored more than just his final days in Alaska. It provides a rich biography of a young man searching for something and having many exciting and interesting experiences along the way.    I enjoyed the biography of Chris' life. It's easy to look at him and call him a \\"whiner\\" and condemn him for not just accepting the \\"good life\\" that was handed to him on a silver platter. It's harder to pull back the layers and actually examine the motives that drove him to the behaviors and actions of his life and death. Krakauer does a good job of investigating his life thoroughly and exposing the impetus for his journeying.    Overall  I think the heart of the story was outlined towards the end of the book. At one point, Krakauer and some of his friends go to visit the bus where Chris was found. In that chapter and those around it, Krakauer explores the psyche and motivations of Chris McCandless.    To paraphrase my take-a-way, he seems to suggest that everyone has a desire for adventure, excitement and to conquer the unconquerable...to push ourselves to the limit and to find (and push beyond) the extent of our capabilities. Krakauer makes the point that as we mature into full adulthood, we tend to restrain the wreckless abandon of youth, but if we're honest with ourselves, we can look back to our youth and see our unbridled passions chomping at the bit for the next great adventure.    In the case of Chris McCandless (and numerous others described in the book), the adventurous spirit full of wanderlust and excitement was never restrained. And in the case of Chris, he took it beyond the teenage spirit of \\"fast driving\\", \\"raucous partying\\", or just plain \\"outrageous living.\\" Chris McCandless pushed himself farther and harder because he had an insatiable desire to do so. Whether that is born of an innate desire to discover the greatness of the human soul or out of stifled inferiority complex in his life, we may never know and truly it doesn't matter.    While we shouldn't go out into the world and recklessly throw ourselves in the path of disaster, I think the heart of this book is telling us that we need to examine our behaviors and explore the limits we have imposed on ourselves. Some limits may truly exist for our safety and our own personal improvement. Others may simply exist because of fear and timidity. The latter should be tossed away so we can truly live.    ***  3 stars
0545128285|5.0|This book was released today and my doorbell rang at 9 oclock this morning with the cutest little package that had Wizard speak on it!!! The book itself is beautiful. The craftsmanship is way beyond the price payed for it and the creative work is amazing. Not even through the Introduction and I was back with an old friend. For any harry potter fan or fan or magic in general this is a MUST BUY! Will be putting money aside to buy the $100.00 Edition asap.
1593080255|4.0|I knew relatively little going into this book...and what little I did know was from less than 100% accurate retellings such as in League of Extraordinary Gentlemen or references from cheesy shows or horror flicks (I think perhaps there was a reference in Scooby Doo somewhere?).  I had the basic gist...there's a guy, Dorian Gray, who has some magical painting that ages while he stays young and wonderful forever.  Not much to go on, but I was still excited to read it.  I was pleasantly surprised that the book had much more depth to it.<br /><br />&lt;u>Plot&lt;/u><br />The plot is intriguing and has been used in other stories, though I think this one has more depth than I've seen before.  Essentially, Dorian makes a wish that he will be forever as pristine as the painting made of him and that instead the painting will take on it the toils of his life.  Whatever supernatural forces allow this to happen are irrelevant...the wish is granted.<br /><br />It's more than a simple \\"young forever\\" contract.  Although age plays into the plot in a couple of places, the primary things that distorts the picture are the vices that Dorian engages in.  The first transformation of the painting happens after an intense argument with the first woman he loved.  It was interesting to me how quickly Dorian recognized the cause of the change for what it was, but had he belabored the motive for too long, the pacing of the book would have stalled and become unacceptable.<br /><br />Dorian uses his \\"power\\" to be ruthlessly reckless in his living.  Dorian Gray becomes entirely uninhibited, taking everything to its limit, seeking absolute pleasure.  He even sneaks out at night (so as not to tarnish his pristine reputation) to the \\"bad side of town\\" and lives a sort of double life in opium dens with gangs and prostitutes.<br /><br />In many ways (perhaps because I so recently read it), I felt many similarities to the morale commentary presented in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  I felt that Wilde did a better job of delving into the psyche of the hypocritical character, largely because we were able to get into Dorian's head and think and feel with him, while in Jekyll/Hyde, we were kept at a distance by a third person narrative.<br /><br />&lt;u>Characters&lt;/u><br />There are three pivotal characters in this book.<br />The first, obviously, is Dorian himself.  For the first many chapters (perhaps nearly the first half of the book in fact), I wasn't terribly pleased with Dorian as a character...he felt very flat to me.  He was basically a mirror to one of the other primary characters (Harry) and didn't ever show his own opinion.  He was hailed as pure and beautiful.  Perhaps it's all the art references in the book, but I often felt as if Dorian existed more as a classical statue than as a living, breathing character.  As his interaction with the 'picture' progresses and once he takes some rather unexpected steps, he became a deeper character and a lot of fun to be with.<br />The second primary character is Lord Harry (or was it Henry...blast those Brits for swapping those names interchangeably so often *grin*).  Harry exists as the provocative, cynical, always-with-a-comment-about-anything mentor to Dorian.  Harry is absolutely encouragable and a lot of fun to listen to.  His speeches often have to do with the pursuit of pleasure at any and all costs and the hazard of a virtuous and peaceful life.  His influence over Dorian is profound.  As I mentioned above, it often felt as if Dorian existed merely as a mirror for Harry's advice.  Harry didn't seem to follow all of his own advice, but Dorian took it readily to heart and strove to live a 'come-what-may' existence.  Harry had some of the funniest and most profound comments of the entire narrative.  He's a fabulous character.<br />The third character I want to point out actually existed as more of a background character, but I feel the need to call him out merely because of his pivotal involvement in the plot.  Iactually can't even remember his name now...but it will suffice to call him, \\"the artist.\\"  He's the one who paints Dorian's picture.  He's the one who introduces Dorian to Harry.  He's the one who tries to give Dorian good advice to counter all the reckless advice that Harry poisons him with.  The artist was kind of like Dorian's \\"Jiminey Cricket\\"...his conscious that was often (always?) ignored until it was far too late.  He showed up in surprisingly few scenes considering the huge importance he had to the plot.<br /><br />&lt;u>Style, Pacing, etc&lt;/u><br />The language used in this book was truly beautiful.  Wilde wrote flowing, vivid descriptions of characters, places and actions.  At times it was very poetic.  It may be a bit too flowery for readers who don't enjoy that sort of description...it came very close to being 'over the top' to me in a few places.  Still, I generally enjoyed the formality of it and the life it gave to the text.  The first dozen or two pages were tedious to me...whether because of the language or just the style and thematic pacing, I'm not sure.<br /><br />The pacing was a bit slower than I would have liked.  The main difficulty I saw was that Wilde was trying to present so many themes that he often had to result to lengthy passages praising or condemning one thing or another.  There were often very long monologues by one of the three primary characters mentioned above.  Harry's were generally offset by bits that made me laugh by their extremity while speeches from Dorian and the artist sometimes made me want to slap them and tell them to shut up.<br /><br />&lt;u>Overall&lt;/u><br />I was a little torn on my overall feeling for the book.  It took me a while to get into it and there were long passages that were drudgerous to push through.  However, from a high level, this is one of the better books I've read this year...or even for numerous years.  It had a plenitude of intriguing themes that left me thinking in between readings.  It had a lot of humorous quips and paradigms as presented by Harry that I laughed out loud at.  It had surprising twists and tension that left me curious as to the true outcome (as opposed to that from rip-off stories).  There are a couple of spots that could be considered \\"climax\\"...the confrontation with the artist is the main turning point in the book.  Personally, I would have rather seen more pages after that turning point than before it.  I think the last 1/3 of the book was far more engaging.  At the same time, the buildup was necessary to promote the intended mood.<br /><br />Overall, this is a book I definitely recommend, with the caveat that you should be aware that it does slow down at points.  Just push through those.  The overall work is worthy of a couple of slow zones.  In fact, perhaps those slow zones serve the purpose of allowing more pondering.<br /><br />****<br />4.5 starsll him, \\"the artist.\\"  He's the one who paints Dorian's picture.

B00195BM3Y|5.0|I've just listened to this album for the first time though, I had heard of the Chameleons from friends and also through limited radio play. This their first album is for me still ahead of its time by a good ten years. It pokes fun at later cure albums and of course runs parallel with new order for darkness and sublime lyrics. \\"View from a hill\\" is the standout track for me written about Tandle Hill a place special for me from Sunday visits wth my mum and dad.Later also with my first daughter and my wife.<br /> The rest of the album is cracking and is well worth the price. I must admit to not being a fan of live tracks however, the ones included on the second disc are quite revealing and provide an insight into the bands sound and cohesiveness.All in all its top!!
0375842209|4.0|I really didn't know what I was getting into when I bought this book based solely on the buzz I was hearing about it. I had heard it was set in WWII Germany and the narrator was Death. With that very small introduction, I dove into the book.    Writing Style  For the most part, I really enjoyed the writing style.    The descriptions were vivid and gripping. The language was fluid and natural while also being engrossing and emotional. I often felt very connected to Liesel and her community.    Having Death as narrator provided a non-human view to the grotesque inhumanity that was World War II. Death has a sacrilegious, sarcastic and cynical tone to many of his comments, but his voice is also dripping with sincerity and depth.    My main complaint is that death had no sense of tension or foreshadowing. Far too often I found myself reading with some anxiety or curiosity only to have Death comment on it by telling me exactly what was going to happen in a few months or years to finalize the drama of the situation. At other times, the thought of possible conflict/drama/disaster hadn't even crossed my mind when Death brings up the possibility and immediately tells me how it's going to end. I would have much preferred a bit of solid foreshadowing rather than explicitly telling me the future.    From an authorial standpoint, I suspect the author had Death explicitly diffuse the drama in an effort to keep the book more light hearted despite the heavy overtones. Still, there are things I would rather have experienced in their due course along with Liesel rather than already knowing the outcome.    Characters  The characters are amazingly full and exciting. Zusak really fleshes out the characters through many very simple means. He provides us a ton of small, intriguing quirks that make each character vivid and real. Papa is the accordian playing, cigarette rolling house painter with a ton of compassion. Mama is the large foul mouthed deep snoring woman who stands by her familyno matter what. Rudy is the kid who paints himself black and runs around the track like Jesse Owens while commentating his own race. And the Liesel is the hurt, confused, lover of words trying to find her place in the world.    And then, there's the narrator...Death. We don't learn much about the physicality of Death, but we learn a great deal about his perceptions of life, earth, and humanity in general. Death is a very vivid character and is used very well to turn a mirror on our own lives and make us think about our behaviors and attitudes.    Plot/Pacing/etc  As alluded to, the plot of the book is heavy and difficult as is understandable considering the setting. Still, things are kept light thanks largely to the narrative style and to Liesel's overarching power to overcome and persevere despite the darkest situations.    There were a couple of times where I was briefly confused as to where I was and where I was going within the plot. For example, the first time we meet Max, I was thrown completely off balance and read that initial page/introduction a couple of times to make sure I didn't miss anything. I was quickly set back on track, but I was still confused for a moment. That was one time that I felt the narrator didn't tell the reader enough about what was going on as opposed to telling us too much.    It was also refreshing to find the story taking paths differently than I anticipated. Without spoiling the plot of the book, I will just say that there were many times I expected stereotypical WWII style occurrences and was strangely and pleasantly surprised when things turned out differently.    Overall  As I mentioned, I went into this book largely blind based solely on some good buzz. And I came away anything but disappointed. In fact, this is one of the better books I've read this year. The story was refreshing (yes, some will tell you that it is a depressing story...and to an extent, they're right...but the tone is light enough to counter the dark material). The narrative voice was honest and thought provoking. The characters were real and engaging. This is one of those books that I'll remember and think about for years to come.    3.5 stars  ****
B001DJLD1M|1.0|When Amazon listed a MATRIX with a 2007 release date in a  keepcase I thought for sure Warners would use the 2004 remaster. Seemed logical-no new content-why go to the work of changing the cover-even the © 2007-just print the cover in a keepcase, Theye  even gave it a new Cat # Why? This is the same old 1999 transfer  I mean, why sit on it. WRONG-and they took pains to hide this-they know they are guilty    When you stick this in  your computer, and the disc icon mounts on the desktop, usually you can open it and see 2 Folders:  AUDIO_TS ,VIDEO_TS and inside  .vob, ifo bup files WITH CREATION DATES.  Not this one-BLANK! huh...never seen this before-I use this as a guide as to when a transfer-NOT a pressing batch date, was done. This issue came out a month ago-and you say they still use the 1999 transfer-sad  Bright idea-Right clicked on \\"Get info\\" (mac) whoo boy- FILE CREATED August 2, 1999    I thought it looked dismal while viewing-wondering what the raving of the 2004 remaster was out     The disc and boxcover had differing Cat #s the box listed ©2007-no location of manufacture; (thought this was law)  The label  had no dates, or \\"made in\\" just the unmatching cat #  I hold it up to the light-the inner ring reads \\"Made in Canada\\"  I was enraged. Legally of course caveat emptor-still WARNER usually has high integrity about these things-a 3 year old remaster should have been on this disc. After all, im sure  yet another remaster will be done for BR-and yet another SDVD issue. or maybe not
B001F7MSFW|2.0|I've been a a fan of the comic Hellboy for a long time and I enjoyed the first movie so I was set to really dig this one. I thought that Del Toro could do no wrong after HB 1 and Pandora's Box. How wrong I was. What we got was a \\"Evil\\" elf straight of of Lord of the Rings who was about as evil as and altar boy next to Rasputin in the first movie which manager to balance the darkness of H.P. Lovecraft with the levity of the comics (but not too much like HBII)<br /><br />Overall, HBII was a mess and was matinee kiddy-fare with hardly a chill in sight except for the tooth fairy's who were still too bloody cute to be scary. Add to all this mess the comedy routine between Abe and HB and it was mostly a loss. I was bitterly disapointed after walking out of the theater.
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|First off, I don't get why people keep thinking this movie is \\"Cheesy\\" or \\"campy\\". THAT WAS THE WHOLE POINT. This film is meant to be over-the-top and cheesy. If you can't tell from the opening scene where the assassin flies from one building to another and shooting 3 people in the process, you obviously are dumb and uninformed. This was meant to be a satire of most action movies that are over the top.<br /><br />On top of that, I saw this film in the theater on Canada Day and it was amazing. One of the year's best action movies! I loved every minute and just didn't want it to end. The over the top action, the sultriness, the cool story and great special effects were enough to satisfy me. The movie is filled to the brim with great action scenes, blood, and Angelina Jolie- That's a sign for a good moviegoing experience. And now today, watching it again on DVD for a second time was a good time again.<br /><br />So Wesley Gibson (McAvoy) is a depressed office worker. He feelss useless, his boss is treating him like [...] and his girlfriend is cheating on him. He has constant anxiety attacks and feels he has no purpose in life. Ready to give up, a very sexy assassin named Fox (Jolie) steps in and gives him something to live for: The Fraternity, a clan of assassins. This gives him a chance to escape his depressing life and job, and this leaves him one task: Kill the man who killed his father.<br /><br />THis movie is awesome- it's bloody, sexy, and action packed. McAvoy gives a great perofmance, Angelina is HOT and looks incredibly bad[...] with the tattos. Anyone looking for a fun time should watch this movie!
B000UNYJXQ|3.0|The American health care system is, by common consent, dysfunctional. It presents an easy target for any campaigner to scandalize us with its sometimes corrupt, arbitrary and venal practices. However, to be persuasive, the arguments need to be accountable, honest and evidence-based.<br /><br />Michael Moore's production is gimmicky and superficial. Moreover, it is shamelessly manipulative, treating us to heart-jerking scenes of tearful, hopeless cases bankrupted by medical bills or grieving over someone who died from treatment refused. He then tours other countries health systems viewing them without exception through rose-tinted spectacles. As grateful, sobbing American patients scoop up cheap medicines in Cuba, he comes to the conclusion that \\"socialized medicine\\" not only can work, it is to be welcomed.<br /><br />But the truth is that no country has a fully socialized system and those that are closest to it (like the UK) are also approaching melt-down. Every advanced country in the world is wrestling with the intractable problem of finite resources colliding with infinite demand.<br /><br />American insurance companies need to reduce the number of policy-holders falling sick, and of ex-patients having relapses. They therefore have a powerful incentive (not present in socialized systems) to undertake sickness prevention programs.<br /><br />The big diseases that health systems have to deal with are eminently preventable, in fact they are self inflicted: cancers, heart disease, osteoporosis, diabetes and so on. I, as a nutritional anthropologist and a Brit, find myself frequently commissioned by the American health system to give courses to doctors and their patients, something that never happens in my own National Health Service - or \\"National Sickness Service\\" as some wags call it.<br /><br />Michael Moore certainly gives many good reasons for not falling into the clutches of the American healthcare system: the politicians in the pay of Big Pharma and the Insurance Companies, the arbitrary nature of health cover, the total absence of cover for many citizens. But the bigger message is that it is no fun for anyone to fall sick wherever they are in the world - and it is possible, in large part, to avoid it! Check out, for example:[[ASIN:0757001424 Deadly Harvest: The Intimate Relationship Between our Health and our Food]].

B001EO2UKO|1.0|I loved Dido's 1st 2 cd's...I practically wore out \\"Life for Rent.\\"  Now, after the huge wait between that cd and a new release....we get THIS???  Part of Dido's appeal is her melancholy lyrics and hooks, but this is downright suicidal depressing!  I realize she has gone through some rough times recently, but come on.  Every song sounds the same as the last...too slow, too wallowing in sadness.  What happened to the Dido that wrote the sassy \\"Hunter\\" and the hopeful \\"See the Sun\\" ??  I listened to it twice (just to make sure I was missing something), then threw it in the corner. :(
B0013FSL3E|5.0|The geniuses at Pixar have done it again with this extremely cute, touching, and socially conscious movie. Wall-E--short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class--is an adorable, vaguely ET-like robot whose job is cleaning up trash by pressing it into cubes. Since the future Earth he inhabits has been rendered uninhabitable by enormous garbage heaps, Wall-E has only a cockroach for companionship; all humans have fled the planet on \\"space vacations\\" and have remained in space for 700 years. In the course of this long absence, they have grown used to an effortless yet artificial existence and have forgotten all about their once-beautiful home, but a miraculous discovery gives Wall-E a chance to bring them back.<br /><br />One of the most unique accomplishments of this movie is the characterization and animation of Wall-E. Although he is very much a robot, Wall-E endears us with his very expressive and human mannerisms. He is full of robot wonder at the things humans have discarded, adding his favorites to a collection, and he falls in love with another robot, EVE, who visits the planet in search of signs of life. What is especially impressive is that all of this takes place with very little dialogue. Throughout the movie, Wall-E only learns to utter a few words, but he still \\"says\\" very much.<br /><br />Beneath the cute love story is a message about the effects of unbridled consumerism. Not only has the planet been overrun with waste, but the space-vacationing people have been made so lazy by technology that they are morbidly obese and unable to get out of their hover chairs. As their spaceship (owned by the mega corporation Buy 'n' Large) runs on autopilot, they simply sit and float, scarfing down food shakes from the Regurgitated Food Buffet and chatting via video screens. So wrapped up are they in these activities that they forgo not only exercise but any sort of interaction with each other.<br /><br />This is yet another wonderful family movie from Pixar. No matter your age, it is impossible not to fall in love with Wall-E and with this magical film.impossible not to fall in love with Wall-E and with this magical film.

B00192KCQ0|4.0|I've been a metallica fan for a long time. I've always been more for thier pre-black album thrash sound but then again i really like the heavy sound of black album as well. After St. Anger i wasn't sure what to expect but, being metallica, i bought the album and stuck it in my car. Once the main riff of \\"That was just your life\\" started I thought \\"Ohhh yeah, this is gonna be good.\\" and i wasn't wrong.      You will hear the trademark sounds of Metallica though out Death Magnetic. It gives us a little bit of everything. You hear a little bit of Justice as well as Puppets but also Black album and St. Anger. Now many Metallica fans were not happy with St. Anger but they have brought the musical exploration they did in that album into this album to give it a modern feel but with all the loveable metallica sound that many felt was lacking in the St. Anger album. Personally, i like it a lot.     This is a good album that is UNDENIABlY metallica. If you like Metallica, be it mainly the black album or all the 80's thrash, chances are you will dig this album. I don't give it five stars because it isn't a masterpiece but it is definately worth putting in your collection.    put it in, crank it up and bang your head.

0316017922|3.0|Ease of Understanding: 8/10: The beauty of the book is how Malcolm Gladwell made the book become like a series of short stories. Every chapter is focused but you will find occasional twists throughout the book. You might not be familiar with lives of Jewish immigrants or Asian rice fields but Gladwell could elaborate them thoroughly.    Distinction: 9/10: There are books which are on many issues of this book. There are books on IQ. There are books on Bill Gates and Silicon Valley. There are books on culture, randomness, talent, honour, you name it. However, this book is on another level by the approach the author used to look at those successes. Malcolm Gladwell connects those things and look through to another layer, opportunity and legacy. All the stories have been told but I believe that this is the first time they are tied and thread together.    Practicality: 2/10: This book is not a self-help book. Do not expect to take anything from the book and make use of it. You cannot really create opportunity and legacy; they are mostly external. However, if you are reading this book at the age of ten to twelve, you might still have time (one point for this). Or if you are going to have or have a child, the book might be slightly helpful (another point for this).    Credibility: 2/10: As intriguing as it might seem to be, do not take it too seriously. The theories of this book lack exceptions (which were present, apparently). The sample size is one or only a few which are not statistically reliable to construct a theory out of each successful story.    Insight: 7/10: Although the number of cases representing each \\"theory\\" is too small, the author could elaborate each example in details and all of them are explained with lots of fascinating facts. The researches are quite deep into each topic and many of them are from the nineteenth century which are fascinating.    Reading Experience: 8/10: This is one of the most fictional non-fiction books! Malcolm Gladwell is a geniusin writing, to be specific, in storytelling. He made some boring and usual stuffs (like Asian's math skill, public school, or Bill Gates!) interesting and made your brain tick all the time. You will feel like you are reading a book from a fiction section rather than what you normally find in Business & Investing section in Amazon.com.    Overall: 6/10: If you read the title \\"Outliers: The Story of Success\\" and focus on the word \\"success\\" and hope that you can become successful as well, I give you a warning, you will not like it. However, if you concern more on the \\"story\\", this is definitely a book for you. Don't get me wrong, the stories are remarkable and I do not regret reading the book at all. There are some wonderful knowledge that I will not forget. I enjoy every minute reading the book. Nevertheless, I am clueless on how to become one of them.    Viriya Taecharungroj  [...]
0525478183|5.0|Margo Roth Speigleman is one popular girl. On the outside she appears to have it all, the looks, the friends, the personality but in all honesty her inside is a mystery to the world. Margo is especially a mystery to Quentin, or Q, who's been her neighbor ever since they were little kids.<br /><br />When they were young they used to do everything together. Some may have even considered them to be best friends. Now though they are about to graduate high school and they barely even acknowledge each other's presence. One night though Margo appears in his window dressed as though she was ready to go rob a bank.<br /><br />She's on a mission to pay back all the people who have wronged her and she is determined to complete her list before the next morning. Using Q as her mode of transportation, she gives him the night of his life. Then she disappears and is now an even bigger mystery to him. Leaving him few clues and a lustrous heart Q is determined to find Margo, and maybe even himself.<br /><br />John Green has done it again, except maybe even better then the last two times. Both his other books have always been near and dear to me, but this one was particularly special. It was compiled of all the classic Green elements of, nerdy guy wanting amazing girl, girl being a little out there, guy finding himself on the way to getting the girl, but it also had this extra wow factor included that easily made it his best book yet.<br /><br />I could really feel not only the characters emotions, but also the author's in every sentence. Many times I found myself laughing along, feeling upset, or just plain frustrated with the events in the story and started wondering if this was a real life experience. There was such truth and purpose to each word that the book seemed alive in many aspects. The characters had real personalities and it was easy to imagine them as real people and these characters dealt with mostly real life situations that I could easily picture myself in. I loved how everything felt so real and alive that most of the time it was excruciatingly hard to come back to reality.<br /><br />For me the plot line was very original and compelling. It was also really easy to relate to. I know in this case that everyone can find someone in the story that they know. Whether it be yourself or a really good friend, you're sure to find someone similar enough for the story to really hit home. I know in my case I was really able to see where the very complex and interesting Margo was coming from. She reminded me a lot of a close friend and helped me see where she might be coming from. It was very evident that the author put a lot of time and effort into developing his characters, which I know as a reader is the mark of a truly great author.<br /><br />This book is one of the deepest and quickest reads you'll find. You'll never want it to end and you'll find great meaning in it. Paper Towns is truly an unforgettable book that is easily the best of the best. With no doubt I am sure it is the best book of 2008 and one my of my new personal favorites.live that most of the time it was excruciatingly hard to come back to reality.

B000UAE7RW|3.0|Chinatown is a unique film in many ways and is considered a classic. It is generally deemed to be a film noir but i have to admit I had a little trouble seeing it. Many of the plot elements fit the film noir genre but visually it was a little harder for me to see. I enjoyed watching the film but the ending changed my opinion a bit. First of all, the plot and dialogue was very intelligent and I really like that about it. I'm not surprised that script won an academy award; it certainly deserved it. The casting was also very good. Nicholson and Dunaway had a unusual but strong chemistry and the supported cast helped build a believable world around them. Again, as far as considering it a film noir, much of the film didnt feel like one. It had the fairly typical detective plot but so much of the film was shot in bright, outdoor scenes. My major problem with the film was the ending. In a largely objective way, it was okay. I did fit certain themes of the film and brought an odd sort of closure to the plot. But personally, it was too disappointing for me. I just have trouble enjoying a story that ends too negatively. In the end, i think Chinatown was a very intelligent movie that kept my attention but i cant say that i want to watch it many more times.

B000UFAURI|2.0|Have you ever enjoyed a really good meal (e.g. lobster, prime rib and a good wine) and just at the end you have a \\"vurp\\" (that's a vomit burp, where that acid comes up and you have to quickly swallow it, leaving you with that nasty taste that completely ruins your dining experience)?  Well, that's what this CD is like.  Let me explain...<br /><br />Track one rocks and gets you into a rocking mood. Track two follows it with an even more hard-hitting-turn-it-up-to-10 \\"Let it Die\\".  But then track three comes on and it's the \\"vurp\\".  Whoa!  Just as I'm ready to  tear it up and put the pedal to the metal, this horrible Erase/Replace comes on.  Whoever arranged the songs on this CD should be slapped across the face with an soiled adult diaper.  The rest of the album is mediocre at best and very mellow.<br /><br />If you must own this CD, rip the tracks to .mp3 and then re-burn the cd in a different order.  When I did, I didn't re-burn Erase/Replace because that song is so bad.  Do yourself a favor and read the other two star reviews and you'll understand what I mean.

0545128285|4.0|The book was decent, in a cutesy kind of way. It is a very quick read -- somewhere around 100 pages. Being in my twenties, I think I was probably a little older than the intended audience. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed the Harry Potter series, but with one caveat: Don't get your hopes up too high. It's good and provides some insight into \\"The Deathly Hallows,\\"  but it's no Harry Potter.
B0001US62I|2.0|One of the rules of screenplay writing is that you don't change the rules in the middle of the game.  Going in, a movie makes an implied contract with the viewer.  If it is going to break the laws of physics, perhaps introduce space aliens or ghosts for example, the viewer must be informed of the fantasy rules straight away.  This film begins as a \\"noir,\\" complete with the stereotypical cheap detective working out of his Nick Danger office in 1954 New York City. The ending does a switcheroo to a world in which voodoo works, devils are real, and Faustian contracts are in force.  I felt betrayed and cheated.    The movie does have a quality film noir look and feel to it, and the acting is top notch. Micky Rourke and Robert De Niro delivered the compelling performances that we have come to expect from them.  The film caused a sensation when released in 1987, because 20 year old Lisa Bonet, who played the wholesome Denise Huxtable on the Bill Cosby TV show, bared her all in a bloody sex and violence scene.  Actually, she only bared her most.  The movie was reportedly re-cut to avoid the dread \\"rated X\\" stigma, but the scene is quite gruesome none-the-less.    The \\"No Comment Commentary\\" feature with Rourke is good for a chuckle.  He was quite obviously not happy with the assignment, and gave only marginally polite short answers and grunts to a frustrated interviewer, while petting a small dog.  How did he prepare for the shoot?  He learned his lines and showed up, he said.  He explained that it was at a time in his life when he didn't really care to be making films.  There's another feature on the \\"real\\" face of voodoo, that is not worth the mouse clicks it takes to navigate to it.
B001CJJWV6|4.0|When I saw this was coming out on Blu-Ray, I had to have it. I was more interested in hearing the upgrade in sound than seeing the upgrade in video. Like Luis (previous reviewer) I too was annoyed with the black bars and that this wasn't truly in widescreen. Alot of TV channels do the same thing and it's just a shoddy, cheap way to do HD. However, I changed my settings on my TV to zoom and it filled the screen nicely. When the menus pop up things are a little off on the zoom setting but it works nicely overall and I would not let the bars keep you from getting this.    Picture doesn't really look much better than the DVD. Hey, it's an old source (over 40 years) and you can only expect so much. When they filmed these shows they had no idea how important they would become. It looks as good as its going to get. Far from anything of recent vintage but you can't expect that. However, you can see everything very nicely.    Extra features... Good enough. I'm not into extras that much but what's here is nice. Some good perspective on the Monterey Festival, multiple camera angles on some songs, some good liner notes. Sadly, no commentary that was on the Criterion release, but still no big deal.     I'm pleased to say that the audio is excellent. Truly a good mix with great separation and rich, full sound. Yes, I would say it's an upgrade in audio. So overall, I'm pleased. I think you make this purchase with the music in mind and on that score they've done very well indeed. No excuse for the black bars but again the zoom feature on your TV will take care of that adequately.
0307269752|5.0|What a loss and a shame that Stieg Larson has passed on!  His talent for keeping one hooked from page to page is extraordinary.  The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is very well written with intricate twists and unforseen turns and a book I found nearly impossible to put down.  I was quite impressed and am now anxious to read The Girl Who Played With Fire.  Highly recommendable!

B00068V384|4.0|Suppose you already had a dozen recordings of the Mozart Requiem, and I came to your house and picked one out at random and played it without telling you which performance I had chosen.  Honestly, most of us could not identify it, and that is simply because so few conductors have anything unique to say about a work in the standard repertoire.  But the chances are good that you could identify Sergiu Celibidache's recording.  His interpretations of nearly everything are unique and identifiable.  Question is, does it work in every case?  Not always, but in the case of the Requiem, I think what you will hear is the power of a great intellect at work.  His deliberate pacing and thoughtful lingering over each note give insights that you probably will not hear elsewhere, and the Requiem deserves such a performance.  I'm not sure it's my favorite Requiem, but I am sure glad I have this recording.
B001DHXT1G|3.0|I never had issues with Ang Lee's \\"Hulk\\" besides some minor ones with the silly dad-made-him story and the goofy looking flashbacks that seem to belong in an Oliver Stone film. More-or-less though, I liked it.<br /><br />The one problem, no sequel. After all, the point of the \\"origin\\" film is to set up at least two sequels, so you accept the slow pacing and the emphasis on how and why knowing that the set-up will pay off in the second film. But, what if there's not a second film?<br /><br />Now the \\"Hulk\\" is \\"Incredible\\" and they're correct, I don't quite believe it. I've read that Norton envisioned a longer, more emotionally complex film and the studios, in typical studio fashion, slashed and burned it. So what is left?<br /><br />While the new Hulk still looks a little too waxy on the skin to be alive (why is it only George Lucas can make completely CGI characters that truly blend?) his emotions come through better thanks to Norton acting out all the scenes for the animators (including a new, hi-def 3-D motion capture for facial expressions) and the result is a more engrossing Hulk character. Unfortunately he has little to do.<br /><br />The film is a simple, long chase. The only twist is that the person doing the chasing is an aging commando who wants a \\"gamma\\" induced boost, which he eventually OD's on and becomes a monster. The result is the obligatory clash of the titans, a destroyed NY city and a finale, almost. The films doesn't want to explain or tie up anything and that's a problem. Once again, there's no end, and no planed sequel.<br />The film shows a third possible mutation / nemesis for Hulk, but only for a second and never returns. Meanwhile the big, bad second hulk monster is not killed, and doesn't return to human form, and is simply unconscious when last we see it. So the movie is supposed to be about Bruce Banner finding a cure, he doesn't and the Hulk defeating the bad guy, he doesn't, and a love story, unresolved, and a chase thriller, that stops chasing, then stalls.<br /><br />The movie lacked the depth needed to carry such an open ending, and with no sequel in site (the movie made scarcely more than Ang Lees but was far more expensive) all that's left is a second origin film and no end in site.e lacked the depth needed to carry such an open ending, and with no sequel in site (the movie made scarcely more than Ang Lees but was far more expensive) all that's left is a second origin film and no end in site.
B0014DZ2VO|3.0|Love Bond movies, but this was way too frantic. Relentless action scenes, almost a video game in some ways. Where has Q gone? Where has the style and poise gone?

B0011KQSZ4|5.0|Not usually a fan of British humor, but this was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  My hubby and I were on a plane when we started to watch it and had people in the surrounding 10 rows wonder what the hell we were laughing so hard about.  A must see!
0345444051|5.0|Arthur C. Clarke's early science-fiction classic is a study in juxtapositions and contrasts: Simple, extremely-readable prose describes complex, mind-blowing concepts; broad, epic chapters on the fate of mankind alternate with cozy scenes set at intimate cocktail parties; the peace and simplicity of commune life in the tropics precedes descriptions of sweeping alien landscapes almost too big to fit in one's head; and, finally, the entire mind-boggling package takes the form of a compact, non-threatening 250 page or so book (depending on what edition you read).<br /><br />This isn't one of those science-fiction novels that tries to speculate where mankind genuinely might be heading.  Rather, to use a phrase probably a little casual for this great work but useful for our purposes here, the story more closely falls under the category of \\"wouldn't it be neat if...\\"  That is, the novel, like so much great art, is ultimately more about itself than being something as mundane and banal as a simple editorial statement on its ostensible topic (in this case, mankind, our foibles, and our place in the universe).  Look at the epic, sad, moving, awe-inspiring (it's all of those things) conclusion, and see if you agree.  If it wasn't before, is the book really about anything other than itself at that moment?<br /><br />And that's fine.  Because a creative work mostly about the wonder of its own imaginings in many ways still reflects the world of its birth, magnifying and questioning and critiquing aspects of that world.  And \\"Childhood's End, as fresh today as when it first appeared in the early 1950's, does all that and more.  So much more.<br /><br />In other words, if you thought the Arthur C. Clarke/Stanley Kubrick collaboration \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" was off-the-charts \\"out there\\", try a little Clarke in its pure, unblended form.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I missed this show when it was (briefly) on Fox.  Big mistake. But I thought \\"An on board prostitute?  AND a preacher? And a doctor in space? Sounds stupid.\\"  Like I said, big mistake.    I encountered \\"Firefly\\" again a few years later when I read a news article on the web about the \\"Browncoats\\" in Boston having a Firefly festival or something. I don't remember the specifics, but I was so intrigued by the song they were singing about the \\"Hero of Canton\\" that I wanted to check it out.  I checked my local library, but then I saw that the price for the WHOLE SERIES on Amazon was under 30 bucks, and I bought it, having never watched a single episode.    Once the familiar smiley faced-box arrived, I opened it up and popped a disk in the DVD.  My son (about 15 at the time) asked what I was watching.  \\"Firefly.\\" \\"Oh,\\" he said, \\"I used to watch that.  It's pretty good.\\"    An understatement.    It's hard to explain.  A Western set in space.  Hard core pirates that you really, REALLY love. A captain who acts like Han Solo would have if he had had a pair.  A beautiful Amazon warrior-princess who marries a pasty white boy (hope for us all!).  A charming, innocent mechanic who can make an ancient POJ spaceship sing. A gigantic bully who names his guns (VERA?).  A snobby surgeon-on-the-run and his lovely demented sister.  And then there's the preacher and the prostitute, who becomes the moral center of the whole show. A crew that is constantly in conflict, until there's an outside threat, when they will fight to the death for one another.    In short, a family.    (WHY was that kid watching this without me??)    Joss Weadon has created a shabby, mundane, future populated by people that seem like old friends.  The witty dialog, the intercut Chinese swearing, the plot that never slows down and always surprises, these things come together in a delicate tapestry that is Firefly.  I'm not exaggerating when I say this show makes Star Wars seem shallow and Star Trek (all versions) seem insipid.  This from a dyed in the wool Trekker.    I watched the whole thing (six+ hours) in one sitting.    So I went to work the next day and I couldn't resist.  I told Tanya, who borrowed the DVDs, and then bought her own and loaned them to Tim who loaned them to Kevin and Cassie, and so on.  I knew I was the Firefly Evangelist at work when John (my boss' boss) saw me working in the lab with blue gloves on (yes, I'm a science nerd), cocked his head and said, \\"Two by two; hands of blue.\\"  His wife had given him the DVDs for Christmas, because he had watched Tanya's.  He loved them, too.    So I went to the office Halloween party this year (2008) as Mal (Mal after a prosperous 20 years or so, I suppose). Also in attendance were Zoe and Jayne.  We shot the rest of them with our nerf guns.    Watch it, get it, and you will be singing the same song as the rest of us:    You can't take the Sky from ME!      One note on the movie \\"Serenity\\", based on this series:  It's good, but... try the TV show.  It's GREAT.
B0013ND30M|1.0|Like many people in Latin America, I grew up watching some great Disney movies. I believe that what really made them such hits with Spanish-speaking audiences (back then) were the great dubs (doblajes) of the time.   I was really excited when Disney started advertising this new special anniversary edition, restored and full of goodies. However, disappointment struck when watching the movie I realized that they had decided to re-dub the whole movie.     Now, one of the reasons this movie was brought back is to show off the potential of a fully animated Disney classic on Blue-ray. Nevertheless, if Disney wanted to advertise tha package as fully restored, they also had to do the so for all non-English tracks (French and Spanish). However, the classic dubs would cost too much money to be restored. Thus, Disney decided to ditch the old and bring in the new. So they just re-recoded everything in 5.1 DEHT and started advertising it as such.    Maybe Disney doesn't understand this, but the old dubs have become inseparable parts of their movies. To me, this is not the same movie that I grew up with and came to love. And hence, the bad grade.    If you don't mind the cheap voice-overs that come in 5,1 DEHT, then this DVD is for you. But if you appreciate good acting, good translations, or just simply want to relieve a really good movie and share it with a new generation of youngsters, then, by all means skip this one.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|I have to say, I wasn't a Terminator fan before seeing this show. I started with episode 1 of season 2 and have been hooked since.

0375826726|2.0|What a waste of a weekend.  I was so upset at the end of this book when NOTHING HAPPENED.  All of a sudden I'm as the end of the book and I realize that the only knowledge gained by this book was the key to Galbotrix's power.  This book drug on and on with battle after worthless, meaningless battle.  There were some interesting parts to the battle scenes, but as a whole the book got no where in the series.  SPOILER ALERT: The other egg is still there, Arya and Eragon have made no progress in their relationship, and there were no great defeats.      And when did this Trilogy become a saga?  I was under the impression that this was going to be a Trilogy and I feel as though Paolini has wasted our time with a book of filler in order to write and sell a fourth book.  I would highly recommend skipping this book and waiting for the fourth to come out.  You won't miss out on much.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Quite simply, Lonesome Dove (1989) is one of the best westerns of all time.  Even the minor characters are multi-dimensional and fully developed.  All of the acting is top notch.  The direction is superb.    But, this story is really about the relationship of two men: Captain Woodward Call (Tommy Lee Jones) and Captain Augustus McRae (Robert Duvall), retired Texas Rangers.  Call, the stoic, is the polar opposite of McRae, a fun-loving \\"philosopher.\\"  Their poignant farewell is one of the most touching you will ever see on film. (Duvall said this was his favorite role.)    I rank this film right up there with The Searchers (1956) starring John Wayne.
B001CU1RRW|5.0|THE ESSENTIAL 3.0 BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN (ECO-FRIENDLY PACKAGING) is an exceptional upgrade to the previous ESSENTIAL BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, this time in environmentally-friendly packaging. The songs are basically the same, but the sound quality is even better, and it's easier to store. Springsteen's advocacies of sanctions on countries that falsely convict foreign tourists, increased funding for law enforcement, and high-school community-service requirements make this anthology, as well as the original albums, essential purchases for both your ears AND your conscience.

B00004XPP0|4.0|I have been a Star Wars fan for as long as I can remember. I have seen all three of these films so much I can quote along with the movie word for word. When I got this for christmas a couple years ago, I was ecstatic. However, when I found out they were the new special editions, I got slightly annoyed.  Don't get me wrong, I still love the new special edition films. The additions and changes don't detract from the enjoyment of the films. They just seem to be unnecessary. Why mess with something that has become such a staple of our society?  Like I said, the additions and changes are minor, but they are still unnecessary. Like the whole music video type song they added in Return of the Jedi. It is all in a made up language anyway so it didn't add anything to the storyline at all. And when they add the jawa getting bucked off his mount. Its just unnecessary.  Some of the additions were more tied to the storyline. Such as the scene where Han first talks to Jaba in A New Hope. They actually filmed that with Harrison Ford originally but didn't include it into the actual movie because they didn't have the technology they needed to insert Jaba into the scene. That scene gives you a little bit more of a look into Han and Jaba's relationship.  The digital remastering is very well done also. The picture clarity is significantly greater in the special edition.  For those of us who still have a VCR and love the Star Wars Trilogy, this boxed set is a good buy. Even though it doesn't have that same raw sci-fi feeling, its still a quality classic set.
0060007737|4.0|This book is not quite as revolutionary as \\"The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing\\" was,  but it still should have a place on your bookshelf.  You won't get a lot of nuts and bolts about building a solid and powerful brand, but you will get the big concepts and basic theories in easily digestible chunks.<br /><br />I've got to grin now though. Earlier in the week I received a review copy of a new book due out in January, \\"Brand Immortality: How brands can live long and prosper\\" that talks about how brands can live indefinitely by effectively breaking free from dying categories and this flies in the face of Immutable Law #21, The Law of Mortality. Such conflict!  I love it. (I'll keep you posted when I'm done with the new book.)<br /><br />Overall, definitely a great book to have.  You won't get much more solid information about basic brand building.

031606792X|5.0|I made the mistake of reading a lot of the reviews of this novel before it finally arrived in the mail. The conclusion I've come to is this: If you are fully engrossed in this saga, then Breaking Dawn will be a book you'll really enjoy. If you are of the mindset who read the stories in this series very critically and you are looking for things wrong, then that is all you will find.    I enjoyed this read. I liked the changes in the characters and the atmosphere. Meyer's writing was much tighter too. Even the ending wasn't as poorly done as so many have alluded to. My only wish is that the book didn't end. There is so much potential for more stories here and I hope Meyer will continue forward in that regard.    So ignore the bad reviews here and give this one a chance. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. I know I was.
B001ED7C58|4.0|When I first got this for my birthday four days before I went to see the movie, I was disappointed. The music didn't seem to fit. I didn't care for any of it at all really. Then I went to see the movie, and the music fell right into place with each scene. I went home and listened to the soundtrack again, this time with images of the movie scenes in mind, and I loved it. I read on here that a lot of people didn't like the music choices, because the music should be a lot of slow and romantic stuff, and that's exactly how I felt. I still think Crush by David Archuleta and Love Story by Taylor Swift should have been in there somewhere, but hey, there's three other movies and plenty of time for other music choices. But so far, they're on the right track. But seriously, before you judge the soundtrack, see the movie. It makes a huge difference, believe me.
B00005ABX0|5.0|Just a comment on editorial reviewer Jerry McCulley's description above of Smiley Smile as an album that was inadvertantly \\"schizophrenic\\" in its approach.  Not only does this poor choice of words betray the common erroneous use of this word to connote \\"divided\\", it also unfortunately presents an embarrasing affront to Brian Wilson who, sadly, suffers from the aformentioned psychiatric condition.  It is a tribute to Brian that he manages to display his musical genius in spite of his problems throughout these 2 wonderful CDs.

An action sequence should be an understandable series of several threats/resolutions, with a mounting overall threat finally overcome with a clever, satisfying possibly surprising solution. Throw in some minute side stories to provide humor/expansion of the theme/ character development. Yes, I know there is a car chase, yes I know there is a chase and a fight...but they are just blurs, confusing and uninvolving. And since when does a Bond action sequence have to be cross-cut with a horse race to make excitment? Next take out the scriptwriters for making a robot out of Bond (Absolvement: Wade and Purvis probably under duress from the producers mesmerized by the Bourne francise/boxoffice). 1/2Bourne+1/2Bond=full bad. Especially sad: as a nod to the blowing up the bad guys HQ at the end Bond thang, they blow up a cardboard modernistic Motel 6. Craig is good, I like the tough guy unstopable force thing. The bad guy goal, to control the water supply of Bolivia?...oh the humanity! Judy Dench is great as M, a perfect mix of brains, management and iron. The two Bond gals are long-legged and yummy. So now Bond is a pilot, and can jump into a 60 year old DC-3 and rip up the skies? The title track was drivel, please don't assign this important task to the flavor of the moment rock star. Does anyone remember the Bond title track by \\"Garbage\\"? The poor British gal, killed by oil, her shining black body draped across a bed...Auric Goldfinger would have approved.
0743496736|1.0|When I first read one of her books \\"My sisters keeper\\" I was completely in awe. I loved it, its actually one of my favorites. I , then , when on to read \\"keeping faith\\" and<br />\\"the pact\\". I loved those as well (all of the endings let me down though). Nineteen Minutes was the ONLY book from hers that I anticipated and I was completely let down. I purchased this book on the day that it came out and i'm STILL struggling to read it....more than a year later. It SUCKS. It beyond sucks.<br />I guess I just found it to be really boring, I dont have enough of an interest in it to keep reading -- at all. I dont think she did a good job with developing the characters, and I didnt wanna sit through an entire 400 & something pages just to be let down by the ending again. This will be the last book from her that i'll ever read. I'm getting a little tired of the court scenes and the new england area.
B001GV09FS|1.0|Can't believe I bought this! Only wanted it because of the extra tracks - I do, I do, I do and Chiquitita - and they're not there. Should have been included from the beginning as should Waterloo.<br />And the DVD featurette is nothing I haven't already seen - except fore some additional photage from the recording sessions it's the same as on the DVD edition.<br /><br />Anyways, if you don't have this soundtrack it's definitly a must. Haven't stopped playing it since I saw the movie the first time last summer. Otherwise, let's just say it's wasted money.
0312360266|2.0|I have read dozens of young adult, urban fantasy, fiction, etc novels about vampires. Yes all of them seem similar, all of them may have semi-predictable outcomes after reading so many for so many years, but Marked is one of the books I had high hopes for, only to be disappointed.  There's plot, action, originality, but to be totally honest the writing style did not do it justice.  I felt like i've read fanfictions that were more engaging, this just seemed to combine pure chick lit with vampirism.  Decent for a start, but out of all the books my sister has let me borrow, this is the only one I haven't read, and one of the only books I tell people to think twice about reading.
B000Y7U98C|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie.  Even though it was largely panned by critics, I fully expected to like it.  \\"Uneven\\" is the word that comes to mind.  For every thing that it does right, it does something else horribly wrong.      I won't get into the details of the plot, as those can easily be found elsewhere.  I will say this: the film starts off well enough and genuinely seems to be going somewhere.  Then the plot holes become too large to ignore and it quickly turns into a steaming pile of feces.  When I say \\"plot holes\\" I am not referring to the absurd notion of the Sun dying out in the next 50 years.  I was more than willing to overlook that in the name of a good movie.  Unfortunately, Sunshine is not a good movie.    It's hard to say much more without giving the story away, but let's just say that a major curveball comes flying out of left field about 2/3 of the way through the movie, and it totally ruins the picture.  It turns what was a semi-interesting, quasi-metaphysical sci-fi movie into a standard issue (i.e. bad) action flick.  It's so beyond plausibility that I was just left shaking my head.  I couldn't believe any of the supposedly intelligent crew members weren't asking: \\"How is this even possible?\\"  They just accept it without any questioning whatsoever.  I thought these people were scientists?  Shouldn't they be, you know, asking questions and trying to find answers?    That leads into my next major gripe, which is the crew of the spaceship.  While the acting is generally very solid, the crew seems pretty weak when you consider that this is mankind's last chance to save life on Earth.  You would think that they would assemble (whomever \\"they\\" are; I don't recall it even being alluded to) a top notch team full of the best and the brightest.  So how come I kept asking myself: \\"These are the best people they could find?  Really?\\"  I understand that a crew full of braniac nerds spewing scientific jargon would make for a horrible movie, but this leans too far in the other direction, IMHO.  It seemed like they picked a crew full of fresh college graduates.  While I'm sure that appealed to the film studio's target demographic, these are hardly the types of people qualified for a mission of this magnitude; they all come across as more book smart than they are reliable and experienced.  Some might consider that a nitpick, but it certainly didn't help create a sense of realism, which is what this film desperately needed.    I know this all sounds like I hated the movie, but it did have several memorable scenes.  Again, it's hard to say much more without revealing certain story elements, but there are some interesting moral choices that have to be made by the characters.  While they are admittedly cliché, they are also the most gripping and enjoyable scenes in the movie.  That probably says more about the rest of the film than it does of those particular scenes, but they were enjoyable nonetheless.    One gets the feeling the filmmakers were setting out to make their own mind-bending sci-fi epic in the tradition of films like 2001 and Solaris.  The ideas are generally good and Boyle and Garland's hearts were certainly in the right place, but the putrid third act kills whatever momentum the film had.  The conclusion becomes rather formulaic and predicable as a result.  What could have been a great movie turns about to be exactly what most critics said it was: a big swing and a miss.
0956010903|5.0|I think this is lovely. I bought it for myself, but if I was given it as a gift I would absolutely adore it.<br /><br />I think the attention paid to detail is amazing and, for me, it is a great way to end a book series that I loved very much. And, most importantly, you are helping a charity.<br /><br />If you just want to read The Tales of the Beedle Barb, then stick with the regular edition - the book is a short read. But if you want to hold something in your hands that will take you right back to reading those last few chapters of the Deathly Hallows, this is for you.
B000000W6R|3.0|Pisces Iscariot is a little disappointing because its sound doesn't reach the height of emotional communication that the real albums have. However, you can find a few great songs here including Frail and Bedazzled, Whir, Pissant, Landslide, and Blue. These songs sound at least as good as the non-hit songs on the real albums.
B00014TJ7K|5.0|I have a confession to make: When Harrison passed away back in 2001, I didn't think too much of it because I wasn't introduced to George Harrison until a co-worker (die hard fan of the beatles) played some of his songs to me. Then about 2 years ago I bought one GH album because I thought he was good. Then I purchased 2 more because I thought he was great. Now I have about 6 GH albums including Cloud Nine, so right now George Harrison is one of my favorite singers. Not so much of the fact that he was a beatle, rather, his post-beatle music, leader of the traveling wilbury's and might I add a fine man. Granted it took me a while to get to know George and all of his hard work, but once I did I considered him as one of my favorite singers.      The songs on this album I rate as favorites of mine:     1. Got my mind set on you  2. devil's radio  3. zig-zag  4. this is love    Bottom line, I'm glad I have this album and I'm glad that I've gotten the opportunity to learn about George Harrison. Thanks George!
1400064287|3.0|How do you communicate so that the message is remembered? The authors have many good ideas. The question is broad so anyone can take something away from the book. You don't have to be a marketer or Powerpoint presenter to get value of the ideas. (You can get the whole content of the book by reading some of the longer reviews on amazon!)<br /><br />This could have been a very nice book if they wrote 80 pages (like the 1 minute series). Now it is just repetitive and bloated. The ideas are good, but it is very tedious to wade through the pages.
B000VWYNOG|5.0|If you are new to Van's music or have no albums, this is a great place to start. If you own almost all his albums, like I do, then this is a great place to reexplore some amazing music in a new context and with better sound quality than some of the older CDs. Sure we can all whine that our favorite song or two are not here, but hey you read the song list before buying. This is the rare full album, 21 songs, of dreamy perfection and leg jumping inspiration. Just enjoy what it is, all of Van's music is a beautiful vision. Dont gobble down a cheesburger, sit down relax and enjoy the perfect 21 course meal. I highly reccomend this album to all music lovers of all ages, it doesn't get much better.
1400067936|2.0|The main thesis is that people underestimate the importance of random events. The book is very timely when I read it after the crash of 2008.<br /><br />My key problem with the book is that the author beats around the bush all the time. It is not clear what his specific arguments are. Since the specific arguments are not clear, it is impossible to think about counter-arguments. And then he moves onto the next chapter and the same structure repeat itself. This kind of tires the intellectual part of my brain.<br /><br />For my non-intellectual brain I do like reading the book, or skimming it. Taleb provides some stories that gives you insight into the lives of traders. I don't find the author unbearable as some reviewers do. Actually I find it nice that he has a strong voice and trashes other people. Like when calling Wall Street economists for entertainers. That makes it more interesting. But the author is always careful not to trash any named individuals. That is not very brave, but I suppose he doesn't want to burn any bridges.<br /><br />The takeaway of this book is: \\"I need to read some more books so that I have a better understanding of the issues in the book\\". Had I read ten books in the areas I would be in a position to rank this book. If you haven't read anything in the area, I would still recommend this book. It should sell well at airports, but I am sure that there are better books out there. Recommendations appreciated in the Comments section!<br /><br />Update: I have read Taleb's \\"The Black Swan\\" and that is a much better book that covers the same ground, but in a much more rigorous manner. Taleb is still unfocused but it is a much better book and I can recommend it.
0316067601|2.0|Ok, I'll probably get flamed for this but let me play the devil's advocate here. Many call this story unbelievable and I really think it is. Remember...he is the LONE survivor...that means he can write anything he wants and nobody would know any better. Here's what makes me question his version of events.    The compromise of the mission. Ok, I've heard this story a few too many times before. Did he read \\"Bravo Two Zero\\" or see the movie by any chance? Well, it's about a SAS team that gets compromised behind enemy lines by, guess what, a goat shepherd. Well, they decide not to kill him and end up in a world of hurt. Sounds familiar? There is also a very similar story about a Special Forces \\"Scud Hunter\\" team being compromised by playing children with the same result. Not saying this can't happen again but it just sounds sooo familiar. Anyway...why does he insist that the only two options were to kill them or let them go and be screwed? How about binding them, stuffing their mouths to buy a little time and getting the hell out of dodge? The mission has been compromised regardless, only thing left to do is to exfiltrate in a hurry. Instead, they let them go and wait...for 30 minutes or more if I recall correctly...doing nothing. Didn't they have a Sat Phone that miraculously worked later? Ok, lets say all this happened, do you really think they sat around and took votes? Do you really think they sat around and discussed what the \\"liberal\\" media would think? Come on! Does nobody else think something doesn't sound right? I am by no means a liberal but I got tired really quickly of him blaming everything on the ROE and the liberals. Of course, this is a wonderful story for all the neocons that are just eating it up.   He is the only one that really knows what happened and I don't believe the story as it is written. Whatever happened, he'll have to live with it for the rest of his life. I have the utmost respect for the military, especially the Special Operations community and I think he is doing them a disservice but profiting from this tragedy and using the story to tell us about his political views. To all the brave men that died in this failed operation...R.I.P. Whatever exactly went wrong that day we'll likely never know but I agree that all involved are/were true heroes. Even the Lone Survivor.
B00065MDSQ|5.0|Robert Fripp would be the first to tell you that the awesome, often terrifying power of this incarnation of King Crimson was never really captured in the studio. For the real story on King Crimson '72-'74 (which is IMO the finest band Robert Fripp has ever been a part of), you should buy U.S.A. or The Night Watch, two superlative live albums from 1974 and 1973 respectively.  Those two discs will give any new (or old) listener an accurate understanding of what these guys were really aiming for with this band: tightrope ride improvisations alternately terrifying and touching (\\"Asbury Park,\\" \\"Trio\\") surrounded by achingly melodic ballads (\\"Exiles,\\" \\"The Night Watch,\\" \\"Starless\\"), ironic art-rock curate's eggs (\\"Lament,\\" \\"Easy Money\\"), and the occasional WTF-I've-never-heard-anything-like-this-before-in-my-life instrumental tour-de-force (\\"Larks' Tongues Part II,\\" \\"Fracture\\").    But Red contains music which never made it out onto the road, and explains equally as well why musos obsess endlessly over this band: talent at EVERY position, at-will improvisational skills, and spectacular songcraft. Red itself is every bit as angry and malevolent as its name suggests: its title track and \\"One More Red Nightmare\\" are conceptually built around the Devil's Tritone, while \\"Fallen Angel\\"'s dire tale of a brother gone wrong and the live improvisation \\"Providence\\" send tingles up the spine.     And it all ends with \\"Starless,\\" which begins as a nihilistic lament and ends...god, how to do this justice?  Okay, here's my half-arsed hyperbolic attempt: the second, instrumental half of \\"Starless\\" is perhaps one of the most emotionally exhausting pieces of rock music I've ever heard, building tension (with a ONE-NOTE guitar solo) to an absolutely unbearable level before shattering it in a desperate, clawing recapitulation of the original theme.  Tension, and release: that's an eternal verity of music right there, and you won't find a more impressive example than \\"Starless.\\" It's up therewith The Rolling Stones' \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want,\\" Genesis' \\"Cinema Show,\\" and The Who's \\"Love Reign O'er Me\\" as one of the most exhilaratingly intense musical experiences I know.      And the sad thing is, my description is utterly inadequate.  You just have to hear the song in all its 12 minute glory to understand.  Look, there's a reason this is not only the greatest King Crimson studio LP, but also one of Kurt Cobain's favorite albums.  That's because the music here is timeless in its invention and execution.
B00079ZACM|4.0|While the 2002 version had the great battle scene of the breaking of the British square, the 1939 version remains my favorite.  Strong cast, a solid focus on the main theme, and a dry humor that sets it apart from other versions.
B000002KNY|4.0|It could have been Talking Heads' best album. You have to admire the conceit, at the very least: 11 songs all about different sorts of fears, from the obvious (\\"Animals,\\" \\"Drugs,\\" \\"Life During Wartime,\\" the insanity of \\"Memories Can't Wait\\") to the metaphysical (the indelible \\"Heaven\\"), to the paranoid (\\"Cities,\\" and the hilarious \\"Air\\").     The lyrical themes are always important when considering the Talking Heads, but what makes this stand out from the rest of their albums is that several of the actual SONGS are better-written, catchier, and better-performed than any others they came up with. \\"Cities\\" (in particular the alternate version available on the new boxed set) witnesses David Byrne stretching his voice like a rubber band in the most gymnastic vocal performance he ever gave, while the deceptively relaxed ensemble playing of \\"Heaven\\" reveals layers upon layers of frustrated, achingly-calibrated tension hidden underneath the surface which only bubbles up during the last chorus (listen for Chris Frantz shouting in exasperation in the background).  Plus, as an admirer of Robert Fripp, I'm naturally drawn towards his work on the opening \\"I Zimbra,\\" which steps aside from the album's themes and looks ahead to the polyrhythmic, surrealistic future of the band lurking around the corner.    But alas, Fear Of Music is also saddled with more undistinguished filler than any of the other albums from the \\"classic quartet.\\"  Perhaps this is the price to pay for the new heights of melodic and conceptual inspiration on the best songs: by pouring all of their great ideas into the standout songs, they were left with some others whose main purpose is just to fill time on the album.  \\"Mind,\\" \\"Paper,\\" \\"Electric Guitar,\\" all fit the theme quite well lyrically, but musically?  This stuff is distinctly second rate for the Heads.  (You won't find anything this indifferently unmemorable on More Songs About Buildings And Food, for example.) \\"Animals\\" boasts an intriguing 7/8 meter and some hilarious lyrics (so true, so very very true) that get it across the finish line, but \\"Drugs\\" too is a bit of a disappointing bore as the album closer.  (The alternate version on the boxed set, with Robert Fripp's queasy guitar overdubs, changes my opinion of this song RADICALLY, but that's not the version we have here.)     I want qualify my criticisms by pointing out that none of the tracks I object to are BAD.  You won't hear these songs and think \\"dear god they've lost the plot.\\"  But you won't be blown away the way you were when you listened to \\"The Girls Want To Be With The Girls\\" seguing directly into \\"Found A Job\\" either.  Buy Fear Of Music to experience its high points: you won't hear many Talking Heads songs better than \\"Air\\" or \\"Heaven\\" or \\"Memories Can't Wait\\" or \\"Cities.\\"  But also understand that, taken as a whole, this is a bit of a dip in between two giant peaks in their discography.
B0013L2EDQ|3.0|OK so being a biologist, it is always a bit hard for me to overlook the semi-factual and outright nonsense in books of this ilk. But once you do, it is an entertaining read. My advice is to treat this as an X-files saga or maybe a comic book without the artwork. As such, try and ignore the inane dialogs and general cliche of the characters. If you go into it that way, you'll be entertained.
B00004TJWE|5.0|You want to know how to recognize the pioneers? They're the ones with the arrows in their backs. In late 1967 The Pretty Things struck out into a whole new realm, taking a suicidally daring chance by forsaking their R&B roots to plunge into psychedelia and create the FIRST EVER \\"rock opera\\" (a full year before The Who ever released that pinball opus of theirs)...and were roundly ignored for all their troubles.     Because everybody remembers Tommy, and nobody remembers its inspiration S.F. Sorrow, about a dreamy little fellow who wants to fly himself to the moon. Now perhaps it's down to the fact that nobody expected this coming from a band that previously had more in common with Them or The Rolling Stones than Pink Floyd. But it's certainly not because of the music itself, which is gorgeous, enveloping, fully-realized and touching in its idealism and ambition. Somewhere God is flogging an angel because of the fact that \\"Trust\\" was never a hit single.
0670020745|5.0|This book has great insight and understanding of a person who is brain injured. If you know someone who has had a stroke and cannot communicate, this book helps you to understand what the person needs to heal. The only thing I found to be negative for me was the scientific explanations for everything that was hard to understand and not fast reading.  The actual story of Jill's experience is fascinating.
B000002KO3|5.0|I initially resisted Remain In Light, because of its intimidating reputation for genre-transcending weirdness.  In fact, I'll be honest and say that I still think that general critical opinion overrates it (More Songs About Buildings And Food is a better album.)     But this is a no-brainer five-star album nevertheless, and I really want to  emphasize that it's not just one of those albums that snooty hipsters try to convince themselves they like without actually enjoying.  The appeal to me of Remain In Light is NOT its exoticism, which is indeed upfront (while also being a natural development out of songs like \\"I Zimbra\\" and \\"Cities\\" from Fear Of Music), but rather how it manages to slap crazy polyrhythms onto winkingly chintzy synthesizer loops and licks, and ties it all together with massive pop hooks to create music which is both avant-garde AND accessible at the same time.     It doesn't always succeed, but when it does, look out Cleveland. \\"Crosseyed And Painless,\\" \\"Houses In Motion,\\" and \\"Born Under Punches\\" are zany surrealistic delights (TAKE A LOOK AT THESE HANDS!), to be sure. \\"The Great Curve\\" is even more impressive, building from a brisk earth-mother fertility incantation (\\"world moves on a woman's hips\\") into a delightfully intricate three part tribal chant. (Let's just boil it down: you WILL shake your butt if you play this song loud, even if you're sitting down.) But \\"Listening Wind\\" is irksomely flat in its pitching, and the entire premise of the album almost falls apart disastrously on \\"The Overload,\\" just when it should be building to a final triumph.    And it all comes together for the single greatest moment the Talking Heads ever put to vinyl, \\"Once In A Lifetime.\\" More than anything, it's this miraculous piece of genius which ultimately earns Remain In Light a space in rock Valhalla.  The instantly recognizable lyrics (\\"MY GOD, WHAT HAVE I DONE?\\") are clever in their refusal to be parsed literally, but I've always imagined this song as the Talking Heads' elitist rewrite of Kafka's Metamorphosis: David Byrne awakes one morning to find, much to his horror and dismay, that he has been transformed into a perfectly ordinary guy. Lyrical concerns aside, the song has a brilliant rhythm track. Frantz is all over his kit, getting a beat that Jaki Liebzeit would tip his cap to, but notice how Tina Weymouth plays the same two bass notes the entire time, without once deviating? THAT, my friends, is fearlessly brilliant minimalism.  That, along with Brian Eno's sturdy backing vocals on the chorus, help the song engage every part of your brain at once, which is why it's an instant classic.  The album needs to be heard if no other reason than that.
B001LPWGE6|4.0|This series will be fantastic in blu-ray. It is already the best spy series of the modern film era. I can't wait to enjoy it in high definition. This is a must-buy!!
B00065MDRW|5.0|Year Zero for progressive rock. Ridiculously complex song-structure? Check! Pratty, regal-voiced lead singer later to join one of the Seventies' more dire groups? Check! DUAL Mellotrons? Check and check! (These being Mellotrons, the second \\"check\\" is slightly out of tune with the first one.) Lyrics written by Pete Sinfield? Check! Robert Fripp? Aye, mate, and how so!    Actually, Fripp's involvement with In The Court Of The Crimson King was actually surprisingly small. He wasn't the bandleader he later became, nor the main songwriter - he was just the quiet, eccentric lead guitarist who insisted on sitting down during gigs. Which is probably why Fripp, who went on to be the last truly revolutionary guitarist in rock history, still holds such a soft spot in his heart for this incarnation of the group he would later go on to become synonymous with: it was a true collaborative effort. Fripp sprays his first definitive guitar moment all over \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" and decorates everything else with laudable restraint. Lake comes up with the bulk of \\"Epitaph\\" and brings his icily patrician vocals to lyrics which need exactly such an approach to not sound ridiculous. Michael Giles drums with a combination of metronomic precision and free-flying expressiveness that would become an inspirational touchstone for future progressive drummers, while also thinking up the great 1-2-3 stairstep chord progression that caps the main riff of \\"Schizoid Man.\\"  Sinfield writes, for the first and last time in his career, a set of lyrics whose cod-mystical literary pretensions are both checked by self-restraint and matched flawlessly to the music.  And finally, the quiet man...Ian MacDonald, who burned with the inner mounting flame that truly fired the first edition of Crimson.      Nowadays everyone thinks of King Crimson as Robert Fripp's band.  Surely that has a measure of truth now, but Fripp would be the first to tell you that back when the Crimso monster first got underway KC was, if anything, Ian MacDonald's band.  Not only was he the band's primary Mellotron player (and remember: it was this album that would inspire a rush on Mellotrons from a hundred aspiring bands - in fact, Genesis actually acquired THEIR brilliantly-deployed Mellotron from Crimson), his reed playing (saxophone, flutes and various & sundry woodwinds) also dominates the album, featuring on every song.  And the range he displayed with these instruments was stunning: yeah, there's definitely some airy-faerie folky flute playing on In The Court, but the lasting impression is given by the psychotic free jazz sax solo on \\"Schizoid Man\\" and the swirling Mellotron assault of the title track.      MacDonald wasn't just the most important player in the early Crimso.  He was also the key creative contributor.  Most of the songwriting was done by Ian MacDonald, and the power of his work on pieces like \\"Schizoid Man\\" (which is SO hard that it will shock you even today: not just loud, but irresistibly grotesque), \\"I Talk To The Wind,\\" \\"Epitaph,\\" and \\"In The Court Of The Crimson King\\" is so undeniable that it boggles the mind that THIS IS THE MAN WHO LATER WENT ON TO FOUND THE BAND FOREIGNER.     Lily-gilding commentary aside, I wouldn't consider any music-lover's collection complete without this album, and not just because of its historical importance. It's because it's one of the most simultaneously shocking, ravishing, stately, and aggressive things laid to wax. A record which announced \\"YO BUDDY - THE 1960'S ARE OVER\\" just as surely as Led Zeppelin's debut ever did.  And now, with this current CD version taken from the (finally unearthed) original master tapes, the best-sounding copy ever available on CD.     If you don't own it, blush.
B000WS4OZM|5.0|Johnny Cash was one of those musical giants who transcended the genre into which he was pigeonholed by the recording industry. Yeah, he was country but he was so much more than that and on American III: Solitary Man he proves it for the umpteenth time.  I bought this CD back around the time it was issued, dutifully listened to and enjoyed it, then put it on the shelf to be somewhat forgotten as I had so many other CDs coming in that demanded my attention. But recently I have been pulling such CDs out to rediscover the pleasure they once gave me. In so doing I came to appreciate not just the bleak expression of Cash's muse but also his droll humor.  My favorites here are the renditions of Tom Petty's I Won't Back Down; a despairing take on Neil Diamond's Solitary Man; a standout cover of U2's One; a chilling cover of Nick Cave's The Mercy Seat; and a sadly hopeful spiritual standard Wayfaring Stranger. I also like the humor of Nobody, Country Trash, and I'm Leavin' Now.  There are many people around who can't stand commercial country music yet they love Johnny Cash. I think that is because the honest emotion in Johnny Cash's voice draws the listener in regardless of what else he/she listens to. I own the entire \\"American\\" series recorded by Cash in his waning years and think that its close to being the best of them. If you have not heard this yet, you owe it to yourself to add it to your collection.
B00007KWHN|5.0|Yeah, I have no idea what the heck these songs are about, either. Anybody who claims to draw deep spiritual meaning from Jon Anderson's lyrics has either taken a lot of drugs in their youth or is putting you on. But the music speaks to you on levels other than the literal: soaring, ebullient, noble, and challenging...and all held together by the debut of one of rock 'n' roll's most commanding guitarists, goofy-toothed self-taught string-bendin' genius Steve Howe.      \\"Starship Trooper\\" is a star turn worth enshrining, \\"Clap\\" is the concept of \\"chops\\" boiled down into 3m17s of acoustic honky-prog perfection, the filigrees on \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\" singlehandedly prevent that song from sagging under the weight of its running time, and while I might argue that \\"Perpetual Change\\" is an awful lot of the former and not nearly enough of the latter, everything comes together for \\"I've Seen All Good People,\\" where these five snooty prog-rockers manage to combine all of their various ideas and influences into a fittingly joyful 6 & 1/2 minute celebration of arty accessiblity.  If you're new to Yes and wondering where to begin with them, look no further: you begin here.  Fragile probably gets more good press than this one (because of the addition of Rick Wakeman on keys), but this is their most immediately welcoming album.  What's more, its immediacy isn't merely ephemeral; you can (and hopefully will) go on to buy many more Yes albums to hear the full sprawl of their career, but I guarantee that you, like me, will keep returning to this jolly little stolen moment from 1971.  A time when progressive music sounded so fresh and outrageously memorable precisely because nobody knew what the boundaries were yet.  This might not be Yes' most \\"accomplished\\" album, nor contain their single greatest song...but if I conclude that on The Yes Album, early into their career, they put out their most truly definitive work, understand that theirs is no disgrace for it.      So who cares if you can't make heads or tails of most of these lyrics?  Jon Anderson has always argued that most of the time he meant his voice to function as a mere instrument in the ensemble anyway, singing contrapuntal melodies to strengthen the overall harmonic musical structure, and that the words were often chosen with that in mind.  (To be perfectly honest, the only major progressive band you should be listening to strictly for the lyrics is Genesis, and then only during the Gabriel years.)  Yes has always been about the MUSIC, and the music on this album is the sweetest and most joyfully energetic affirmation of their stated goal available.
B001M6KTLG|2.0|Ouch.... this was painful to sit through.<br /><br />I wanted to like it, I really did.  The original RotLA was intense and exhilirating, with a great plot and storyline.  I thought the last one released, where Indy's dad (Sean Connery) participates, was getting a bit hokey, but this last one was hopefully really the last one.<br /><br />Shia LeBouf as a 50s tough?  Snort<br /><br />This film was actually an exercise in how much really lousy CGI the studio could cram into its time frame.  The entire thing was so patently unbelievable and cornball that any attempt at suspending disbelief was simply out of the question.  For this we waited so long?<br /><br />No more please.  Indy has jumped the shark and the sun is setting.  This is what happens when people make movies only for the money.
B00006AW2J|5.0|a.) QUESTION: How could you tell that Brian Jones, who was having trouble staying upright at this point, was also having difficulty adapting to the arrangements on Beggars' Banquet, the Stones' return to their blues-based roots? ANSWER: The wackily inappropriate Mellotron on \\"Stray Cat Blues.\\" (Listen for it! You'll never be able to ignore it again!) QUESTION: What counterarguments could be made?  ANSWER: The magnificently patient slide guitar on \\"No Expectations,\\" where Jones manages to conquer a musician's natural instinct to rush the beat, and lets his sighing, resigned playing act as musical commentary on the lyrics.    b.) \\"Salt Of The Earth\\" has GOT to be the world's most amazingly insincere, unrighteous anthem to the masses I have ever heard - completely cynical, phony, and full of scat - and therefore absolutely brilliant. Nothing more perfectly encapsulates the Stones' discomfort with the \\"revolutionary masses\\" than this totally bourgeois hymn to them. Listen to those lyrics: \\"As I look out into faceless crowds, swirling mass of greys and blacks now, it don't look real to me, in fact it looks so straaaange...\\" This is so great; would we really want a truly compassionate anthem from The Stones? Of course not. So we get a song that sounds like a populist ode at first, but on closer listening turns out to be something quite different. And it has these wonderful images of rich people drinking wine trying to come up with toasts to the common people. They're \\"raising a glass\\" to the hard-working people. They certainly don't seem to be hard-working folk themselves. And as the song progresses, they seem to run out of good things to say about the common people, and start talking about stay-at-home voters, and those faceless crowds....here's to the bourgeoisie!    c.) In fact, Beggar's Banquet as a whole holds together lyrically much better than many of their other albums. All the songs seem to alternate between demonism (\\"Sympathy For The Devil,\\" \\"Stray Cat Blues\\")and world-weariness (\\"Jig-Saw Puzzle,\\" \\"No Expectations\\") and some seem to embrace both (\\"Street Fighting Man\\"). It seems to me that they're obviously becoming tired of that demon life that's got them in its sway.
B00180R06I|2.0|I was recommended by none other than the Wall Street Journal recently that this was the \\"scariest movie ever\\". Not. Want scary?  Avoid this over-hyped trash with all its subliminal scary faces and rent \\"The Exorcist\\".  Or, go to youtube and watch the Mumbai attacks for real fear.  This movie is not scary!  It is stupid.  Even \\"Dracula\\" wth Bela Lugosi was at least far more interesting.  Put a stake through this one's heart.
B000002UJQ|5.0|What can anyone say about OK Computer more than ten years after the fact that hasn't been said a thousand times already?  Probably nothing, but heck - that's never stopped me before.<br /><br />Discovering OK Computer back in 1997 was like waking up one morning to find a Triceratops lumbering around in your garden, munching lazily on your begonias and knocking shrubs over as if nothing was out of the ordinary: \\"Uh, mom?...Yeah, there's a dinosaur in the backyard...I know ma, I thought they were extinct too.\\"<br /><br />I'm betting a lot of folks who were paying attention back then remember where they were when they heard OK Computer for the first time. It's the musical \\"where were you when Kennedy was shot?\\" of my particular generation.  I remember driving to meet my friends for dinner, having bought this disc at Best Buy, and being so floored I was late to the meal because I had to drive around and listen some more. Back then I was intensely skeptical of the value of \\"modern music.\\" Furthermore, it typically took ANY album several listens to sink in for me.<br /><br />But OKC still stands out as one of the most instantly accessible albums I've ever bought: perfectly tuned in to my psychological and musical channel-settings. All kinds of details which normally take months to emerge leapt out at me. The opening five seconds of \\"Airbag,\\" with that monstrous riff that resembles a viola staplegunned to a surly guitar, sealed the deal on the spot. Then \\"Paranoid Android\\" - King Crimsonesque prog-rock by any other name, and all the better for it: beauty and horror seamlessly melded together.  \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien.\\" \\"Exit Music.\\"<br /><br />Blow by blow they came to me as I puttered aimlessly around that afternoon, each song building upon the momentum of the last. And then, most mindblowingly of all, \\"Let Down.\\" I listened to that song for the first time, back on that slate-grey cloudy day, with a fully slackened jaw. The music sounded like it was being played backwards, sucked down by the riptide of its own current (technically speaking the effect comes from the clashing 5/8 meter of lead guitar played atop the relentless 4/4 march of the rhythm section).  The lyrics evoked that same sense of desperate technological anomie that I had begun to feel but lacked the skill to put into words.  And the melodies...oh how they soared and swooped, splitting into harmonies and dovetailing effortlessly until the whole thing ground to a computerized spark-spraying halt, leaving a lonely acoustic guitar to peter the churning riff out on a grateful, exhausted A major ending.  Musical DRAMA, my friends.  Holy guacamole.<br /><br />Understand: I didn't think people MADE music like this anymore. Melodic, emotional, complex, psychologically profound, and most of all, unabashedly, luxuriantly beautiful...everything was in its right place. Thom Yorke's voice was something I thought dead in rock music: a voice unafraid to EMBRACE its own beauty, rather than reject it petulantly a la the grunge and metal fashions of the day.  It turned out that that every musical value *I* held dear was shared by this somewhat esoteric British art-rock act I'd previously associated with an early-90's novelty hit.<br /><br />I - we, all of us who chanced upon this record ten years ago - had discovered a magical secret in OK Computer, a well-known record that still felt like a private, intensely personal keepsake.  And even if that blush of first love has long since faded away (honestly, Kid A is a better album), I will never forget how this record forever changed the way I heard music.  In all seriousness: thanks, Radiohead.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|Hello God, it's me.......ummmm, I can't really remember my name right now. I just watched the biggest mind f@#* of my life last night and still can't shake it from my head. Not really sure what to write other than the fact that I was pretty sure that I had seen it all, but I guess it's good to know that there are some things in this world can still shake you to your core.....for better or for worse.           All I know is that if I was ever abducted and locked away for 15 years....trust me, I wouldn't have been able to handle it quite as well as Oh Dae-Su.           Nothing I could write down here should be able to influence you as to whether or not you should see this movie. If you've got a strong stomach and a good moral center than you should be able to walk away from this movie somewhat numb but knowing that maybe your life isn't really that bad after all.            However, if you've ever really hurt somebody in your life, maybe not physically or even intentionally, to the point where they have dedicated their whole life to making yours a living hell.......then might I suggest that you sleep with one eye open.....          I think maybe I'll go to church today, something I haven't done in years. And I'm not saying that to be funny either.
B00009P1O0|5.0|Neil Young's finest album by a fair margin. It's ungimmicky and aggressively uncommercial: let's see, we've got 3 or 4 twelve-bar blues songs, one banjo-pickin' slice of the Ozarks, two straight folk songs, and one ponderous ballad. Not exactly Harvest, Part II.    This is the album where Young finally learned to just not give a dang what anyone else thought he should be doing with his music. \\"Walk On\\" is a stoic but upbeat kiss-off to the people who'd claimed Young was artistically 'dead,' and it's intentionally mirrored in the last song on the album, \\"Ambulance Blues.\\" The point of \\"Motion Pictures\\" has little to do with movies and everything to do with the lines \\"All those people think they've got it made/But I wouldn't buy, sell, borrow, or trade/Anything I have to be like one of them/I'd rather start all over again.\\" Similarly, the cryptic lyrics of \\"For The Turnstiles\\" (which showcases one of the most taut, finely-calibrated arrangements of any Young song, period) are clarified by the final verse, where the narrator passively observes the fickle crowd abandoning its team, leaving them to \\"die on the diamond\\" while they scatter for the turnstiles.     As for \\"Ambulance Blues\\" (the best song) it may be poor taste to go directly after your critics, but the resigned manner in which Neil does it is absolutely essential to the concept of this album, whose overriding themes speak about strength through irony and wry detachment, and about throwing off the crippling yoke of others' expectations.    So I wonder if the symbolism of the title & cover isn't often lost on people. While most of these songs may sound extremely doomy, Neil is ON THE BEACH: he's come through the fire and made it to the water's edge.  This shouldn't be heard as a dark and depressing musical experience, but rather as a passionately redemptive one.  Which is why, if you buy into the confessional ethos of the singer-songwriter genre in the first place, this should be your alpha-omega album.  Whatever it is you're looking for emotionally: it's in here.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I read Bob Lefleur's take on this set. He was there, in the real battle and we mere mortals can only imagine the Hell they went through during WWII. My dad and uncle were there. They had some very amusing stories about the great group of GI's they fought with, but some very grim details about the actual war. So, I want to thank Bob Lefleur and all the vet's that were there. Without them, things might be much different, in this world today. As for the Band of Brother's set? It is THE most realistic series about WWII ever produced. If you want to see how it really was, get this set, as it is awesome to watch.
B00000255F|4.0|A monolith of 70's music, this is Springsteen's attempt at summarizing everything that was good and pure about the previous two decades of American rock 'n' roll. \\"Thunder Road\\" alone spikes a tap deep into half a century of post-war American folk and teenage mythology, with its casual references to Roy Orbison, Robert Mitchum films, prom-night fantasies, country porches, dusty beach roads and adolescent \\"Leader of the Pack\\" ghosts.<br /><br />It's a very calculated album, though, and I confess that this premeditation hurts it when compared to the more spontaneous \\"noble savage\\" vibe of The Wild, The Innocent & The E Street Shuffle.  Some of the music on here is actually rather generic for Springsteen during this era: \\"Night\\" is Boss-by-the-numbers, seemingly written as a means to a conceptual end, and \\"She's The One\\" fails to deliver on the promise of its Bo Diddley necromancy. (Try to check it out live, however...the performances from Springsteen's 1978 tour, with \\"Mona\\" interpolated, finally pull it off.)<br /><br />As proof of how naked and daring Springsteen's stylized ambitions were on Born To Run, realize that \\"Jungleland\\" -- with its star-crossed \\"Magic Rat\\" and \\"Barefoot Girl,\\" musical gangs full of kids who \\"flash guitars just like switchblades,\\" and midnight shoot-out leaving the hero dead while the Girl mourns -- is nothing more than a goofy 1974 rewrite of that hoary Broadway chestnut West Side Story.<br /><br />And as proof of how well he managed to pull all this off?...well, why don't you just admit that most of y'all have been hearing this song for more than 30 years now without making that connection.  Pretty good job, I'd say.  But still, Born To Run is too consciously artifical in its construction to rank as Bruce's best.  On later albums, the seams, joints and bolts of his assembly didn't show nearly as much.  On earlier ones, the act of creation was more organic.  I can't remotely conceive of anyone being disappointed if they buy this album (for god's sake please do it...it's much more than just the two radio hits), but it's not his finest work.it...it's much more than just the two radio hits), but it's not his finest work.
B001H5X7I4|5.0|I'm not a big fan of Jack Black or Ben Stiller, although his Focker movies were pretty good.  I got this movie not knowing what it would be like.  For me it was  a shot in the dark.  It turned out to be a hilarious surprise.    Robert Downy Jr. complete steals the show in this movie and was the prime source for everything I was laughing at.  He was perfect.  The makeup was perfect and he acted so well that to hear his real voice while in makeup looked extremely odd.    It's definitely a movie to re-watch!
1593080891|5.0|Emma Woodhouse, \\"handsome, clever, and rich,\\" is the 21-year-old daughter of the elderly owner of Hartfield, the largest estate in Highbury. Though only a couple of hours away from London by carriage, Highbury regards itself as an isolated and virtually self-contained community, with the Woodhouse family the center of social life and at the top of its social ladder. Emma, doting on her hypochondriac father, whom she represents to the outside world, has grown up without a mother's softening influence, and at twenty-one, she is bright, willful, and not a little spoiled.<br /><br />Having too little to do to keep out of trouble, Emma's hobby is matchmaking, \\"the greatest amusement in the world.\\" Unfortunately, her sophistication in the social graces does not extend to much insight into human beings.  Taking Harriet Smith, a young woman of \\"questionable birth\\" under her wing, Emma makes Harriet her \\"project,\\" educating her in the social graces, convincing Harriet not to marry farmer Robert Martin, who has courted her, and ultimately persuading Harriet that the vicar, Mr. Elton, is falling in love with her.<br /><br />Bored and without a large circle of \\"suitable\\" friends, Emma is an incorrigible meddler, playing with the lives of those around her, snubbing those she considers inferior, gossiping about others in an attempt to divert attention to herself, and misreading intentions. Only Mr. Knightly, sixteen years older than Emma and a friend of her father, stands up to Emma and tells her what he thinks of her behavior, and it is through him that she eventually begins to grow.<br /><br />Love and the formal protocol of marriage are a major focus here, with marriage more often a merger of \\"appropriate\\" families than the result of romance or passion. Class distinctions, acknowledged by all levels of society, limit both personal friendships and romantic possibilities, and as Emma's matchmaking fails again and again, causing grief to many of her victims, Emma begins to recognize that her pride, willfulness, and love of power over others have made her oblivious to her own faults. Austen shines in her depiction of Emma and her upperclass friends, gently satirizing their weaknesses but leaving room for them to learn from their mistakes-if only they can learn to recognize the ironies in their lives. Though Emma may be, in some ways, Austen's least charming heroine, she is certainly vibrant and, with her annoying faults, a most realistic one.

B001DDBCUA|2.0|Not sure what I didn't like the most - the bathroom \\"humor\\" - what was that all about? Huh?? or the Jennifer Hudson addition - could have lost that entire character. So Carrie has these treasured friends but finds \\"the answer\\" about love with somebody she has known for a minute? And then gives her this tacky handbag as a measure of her self worth  . . . oh please! I would rather watched more of Mario Cantone and Willie Garson - they were in the movie mere seconds. This could have been done SO much better and really I expected it to be from SJP.
B001ED7C58|5.0|Muse's \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\" rocks and was perfect for one of my favorite scenes from the movie...the baseball game!  It has definitely introduced me to different genre's of music than I normally listen to and I love the diversity of the music.  The more I listen to it, the more I love it.  Of course, I'm a HUGE fan of the books and the movie itself.  I'm a true Twilight Mom...what can I say :-)
B001H5X7I4|3.0|Tropic Thunder is the tale of five typecast actors(the action star, the comedian, the intellectual award-winner, the hip-hop artist and the newcomer) who all end up getting more then they bargained for.<br /><br />When the scenes just aren't making the big boss happy, the director decides to film the entire movie guerrilla style and unknowingly drops the cast in the middle of a field of real land mines. After the director meets and untimely death the cast of actors can't figure out if all this is just a set up, or if they really should be scared for their lives.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. gives a routinely dazzling performance as Kirk Lazarus, an Australian actor who has gone under a controversial surgery to play an African American Sargent.  Ben Stiller also holds his own as Tugg Speedman, the action star trying to re-vive his dwindling career.<br /><br />It's not as hilarious as it could of been, but there are a handful of excellent scenes with an overall creative storyline; worth at least one viewing.

B0012QE4Q2|4.0|Look at the thirty minutes of out-takes and deleted scenes in this DVD's extras and you'll see that many of the best, explanatory, and touching scenes (mostly involving Mary Boleyn) were chopped out. All because some idiot wanted to keep this film to two hours.    What remains is visually breath-taking, thought-provoking, and intense. Cinematography is outstanding. This film stayed in our thoughts long after my wife and I left the theater. Philippa Gregory, in many of the DVD's extras, gives much commentary and describes the film as \\"beautiful.\\"    I agree that this film is best approached as a stand-alone movie. Through the decades, generations of readers have expressed their disappointment at films based on the book. GONE WITH THE WIND was not as good as its book. When it was released, THE WIZARD OF OZ was considered mediocre and unlike the J. Frank Baum book on which it was based.       Still, THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL should be seen, if not in this version then in its British version. Why? Because of Anne Boleyn's historical significance. If not for Anne, there would be no Queen Elizabeth I. If not for Elizabeth, there would be no push for English colonization and no English-speaking North America. Then you couldn't read this review, because I can't speak French!
1582701709|1.0|I've been into the self-help books since I was 20, today I am 34 and I've read 200 (or more) books of this kind (including almost all books from \\"the law of attraction\\"), so after so many years reading so much rubbish my mind was very confused and my life too. On the financial realm, I got a enourmous debt, on the professional realm, I got only stress and more stress and a unhappy job, the more I \\"tryed\\" to use the secret and others \\"tools\\" (like Dyer Japa meditation to manifestation...) the more my life sunk. One day, in deep depression I collapsed, and I did what I should have done 10 years ago, going to a psychologist, a real professional about our mind health.    Only when I started to visit a \\"real\\" psychologist, my life startet to turn to a \\"real\\" good life, a better work, making theaters clases to learn how the be an actor (what a always wanted since I was 16, but never had the courage to do it), and so on. Today I can say I have a happy life, because, and I quote, I live in the \\"real\\" world right now, I am working hard to change my financial situation, and I know it will take a long time to fix the mess I made following so many self-\\"help\\" books.     Do you know what the secret really is? And nobody from the self-help business want you to know??????    YOU DON'T NEED THEIR BOOKS TO HAVE A HAPPY LIFE!!!     If you are confused about your life, or you don't know what path follow to have a better life as I was so many years ago, instead of reading this \\"be happy now\\" books, go to a psychologist, or to a certified life-coach, and you will see that after fixing the mess you have in your head, your life will be \\"the mirror\\" that will reflect a better life for you, in the \\"real\\" world.    The only self-help books I found very useful after all this years of research, are from Dr. Martin Seligman, Dr. David Burns and Tony Robbins, they talk about the real life but even their books won't replace any therapist.    This kinds of books are like the tv comercials that say\\"lose weight fast and get a body like this in 10 days!\\", are you really sure you want to put your mental health (this books cause depression in the long term) in risk and spend your time trying this? It's very attractive to the people that feels lost, but thanks to God there are people that \\"really\\" know how to help others.    You could ask me, do you have a explanation for the people that get \\"lucky\\" and win the lottery for example? No, I don't have it, and honestly, I don't think any of us could \\"really\\" know about it, but the real question is: from the people that have a happy life, 90% worked hard to get it (to have a healhy body, financial stability, loving relationship...), and 10% got \\"lucky\\" (won the lottery, etc...), so if you were in a cassino betting your life, in which place you would bet? Why try the path of the few winners??? Why don't try the path of the people that with patience and endurance works for a better life for them and for others around them?    I hope this review is helpfull to you trying to understand what is all this fuzz about this book and dvd.    God bless you all.

B0019M06JS|5.0|There are stories that only become better with time. Depending on who tells them, of course.<br />Eliane Elias is not only a talented pianist, but also a wonderful singer, reminescent of Astrud Gilberto, but in her own right.<br />This disk has such wonderfully fresh takes on classic bossa nova as \\"The Girl From Ipanema\\" and \\"Desafinado\\", as well as jazz standards like \\"They Can't Take That Away From Me\\" or \\"Day By Day\\". And even a great version of Stevie Wonder's \\"Superwoman\\".<br />Also pay attention to Ivan Lins, brilliant as ever, in \\"I'm Not Alone\\". Another special guest star is Toots Thielmans and Oscar Castro Neves is an exceptional guitar player.<br />This is music both for bossa nova lovers and those who have never even heard of it before. After listening to it they are going to become obsessed with the music.
B001GKJ2FC|5.0|I didn't know this film was so crazy. It reminds me of Chinese Action/Fantasy films. After all the attempts, this film gives you that 'nutty' mix of serious 'ballistic action, gore, romantic fantasy, comedic, time shifting characters with a destiny' story that the West has been trying to replicate.<br />The Blu-Ray A/V quality is the best so far, and more so. System threatening sound.
031606792X|5.0|This is the best series I have ever read, and I can say that having lived through nearly all 4 sagas myself, I have come to appreciate Stephenie's compassion for her characters through writing.     Breaking Dawn encompasses the Love that was chosen from book 3, and committing to it. There is an endless array of emotions in this book, and I feel the older audience (or younger adults in their early 20s such as myself) would appreciate it a greater deal than the younger readers would.     Overall, the delicate details of this book is highly impressive, and I suggest you read it yourself before going with all the naysayers who honestly, may not have reached that stage in their life to appreciate the completeness of this last book.
0671027573|5.0|I read this book years ago but wanted to say, from what I've read, that this is one of Linda Howard's best novels.  Mr. Perfect is full of great lovable characters, especially the 2 main ones- Jaine Bright and Sam Donovan, racy love scenes, tons of humor and wit, mystery, suspense and an interesting plot.  I personally, felt that if I had a neighbor like that myself, I would be doing the same exact thing that Jaine had done.  I felt that I could emphazise, for the most part, with the heroine and was drawn completely into the story.  I couldn't put down the book until I was done.  Get a copy today and it won't disappoint!
B000WZAE1I|5.0|.... and I RARELY say that about films.  Almost never, in fact.<br /><br />This movie has it all: romance, action, clear cut good guys and bad guys, adventure, a little bit of magic, you name it.  As a genre I would say it's like a Grimm's fairy tale adventure with a hint of fantasy.<br /><br />As others have said in their reviews, the trailer did not do this movie justice.  I remember watching it and seeing two blond women and the guy talking about a two faced dog and then saying \\"wha...?\\"  My friend dragged me kicking and screaming to the theaters to watch it.  After my first viewing I ended up seeing it five more times in the theater alone.<br /><br />I found Stardust to be both charming and refreshing.  Being a musician, I instantly appreciated the fact that the background music was composed FOR the movie.  This is very rare to see in cinema these days and I can't tell you how much it added to the film.  The characters and plot were also simple and straightforward.  I'm sure the critics would say this is \\"cliche.\\"  But you know what?  I'm ok with a well done cliche.  There's a reason why people like dashing heros and damsels in distress.  It transports us to a better, more idealistic world.  Stardust does not try to bog itself down with cornea fusing special effects, shaky camera motions and questionable \\"plot twists\\" that seem to be a depressing theme in most movies these days.<br /><br />The best way to describe this movie is \\"it's fun.\\"  It really is.  You feel like you've had a good time once you've watched it.  You don't walk away from your tv thinking \\"wait, what happened at the end there?\\"
B000N2HBSO|2.0|Goodwin sees history through her own prism.  She depicts history to conform to her preconceived notions and to preserve her progressive perspective.
B00005ASGG|1.0|There is reason to believe that the conjecture of the reviewer M. S. Anderson, who awarded this film three stars, is right. He thinks that the professorial class is keeping this movie alive. My own experience confirms that suspicion. I have lost count of the number of journal articles and encyclopedia entries that contain unrestrained praise for this film and especially for its signature clich&eacute;: the solemnly ironic line about printing the legend when the legend becomes fact. As if newspapers routinely print the truth!<br /><br />Yet one searches in vain--either in academic analyses or in the three-hundred-plus four- and five-star Amazon reviews--for references to the film that point out that the sets look like fiberboard structures on the studio's back lot, that characterization is shallow and predictable, that the script is trite and sits clumsily on the tongue, that O'Brien and many other supporting players are inadequate or worse, and that Stewart and Wayne are not alone in being almost thirty years too old for their parts. Fortunately, the video's production, while by no means outstanding, is acceptable enough to give first-time viewers an adequate sense of what a theatrical showing would, for better or worse, look and sound like.<br /><br />Rather than conventional villains, John Ford's best movies tend to have characters whose principles and actions, while often reasonable and defensible, clash with those of the hero or heroes. So what, then, is to be made of Liberty Valance (played by Lee Marvin), a two-dimensional villain if ever there was one? He is so evil that he dresses entirely in black and even carries a whip. One might reasonably ask whether Ford expected audiences to tremble or to laugh at him. Clearly, the character of Valance was in the director Elliot Silverstein's mind when, several years later, he cast Marvin in an Academy Award-winning double role in the still amusing [[ASIN:B00004TJQK Cat Ballou]]. Yet none of the admirers of Liberty Valance have drawn attention to this connection, which is surely worthy of some note.<br /><br />Many of those who first saw The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance in its initial run fifty years ago (I was one of them) judged it an undistinguished movie, less an ornament than an embarrassment to its director and stars. It should be permitted to ride off into the sunset, never to be heard from again. Yet the members of the professoriate, the radical environmentalists of American popular culture, insist that it be forcibly recycled through the captive minds of America's young, a large number of whom seem now, alas, to be devoted to bestowing five stars on one-star films and to proclaiming unhelpful those who disagree with them.have drawn attention to this connection, which is surely worthy of some note.<br /><br />Many of those who first saw The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance in its initial run fifty years ago (I was one of them) judged it an undistinguished movie, less an ornament than an embarrassment to its director and stars.

And, the avante garde stuff, like his version of Billy Jean, which often spiced up other dreary AI performances are absent.  Don't expect a rock album with jaw dropping good instrumentals, this is for vocal lovers only.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I have read the books and I must say the first season lives up to it quite well.  YES- there is a different direction taken for the supporting characters.. but you have to remember that the book was written in the FIRST person with ONLY Sookie's point of view known to us- so from that we can only imagine what the other characters were doing at the same time.  I think HBO did a great job filling in the blanks by giving ALL the characters a story line and their own LIFE.   It's OF COURSE going to differ from the books- to add suspense for the avid readers who already know what's going to happen.  However I do not feel that Sookie's story line was changed at all.    I *LOVE* this show, as well as the books- and I would recommend this series to anyone who loves Vampires!    CHECK OUT CHARLAINE HARRIS - Great author who wrote the Sookie Stackhouse Series.
B001M5UDGS|1.0|In a nutshell, boring.  A poorly written, stupidly cliche plot attempting to make light of itself and supervillans everywhere.  The title alone tells you absolutely everything about this monstrosity.<br />If you are a fan of humor that is completely spelled out for you in excruciating detail (ie. the onion) then you will love it.  If, however, you prefer not to be beaten over the head with a premise that is the only joke... you will turn it off after about 2-3 minutes.  We get it, you're making fun of a cliche.  Now what?<br /><br />Now I go watch something else.

I was hooked from the first page and found myself wanting to play hooky so I could go read.  Scalzi must have a heck of a college degree becuz he anticipated tiny details of what life might be like 200 years from now.  And you just gotta love the characters.  You didn't want any of them to die, they were written so good.    The main guy is 75 when he joins the colonial forces and we follow him through the process of getting a new body and training.  Then we follow him and his freinds into the far vaster universe than we ever imagined.  It is great and will appeal to readers of every age becuz the interactions are so human and real.

B000QQFKYE|5.0|This is really good.<br /><br />Yes, three hours is a long time to sit still so I would recommend watching it in small doses and letting it work its way into your imagination a little at a time.<br /><br />First of all this is the work of a master interrogator of the subconscious. What Lynch captures is the way the subconscious constructs its own realities and selves out of the strata of inchoate memories, feelings, and desires. But the self is never altogether stable nor completely secure for those memories and feelings and desires are always shifting and giving way to new memories, feelings, desires and selves.<br /><br />In reality creative people (writers, directors, actors, painters, poets, ...) are always constructing and exploring the virtual worlds and selves that they create. This is their status quo. But what Lynch does is create a kind of paranoid fantasy world where his main character, Laura Dern, experiences multiple versions of herself amid multiple narratives. And she is powerless to choose between her actual self (if any version can be considered the authentic one) and the virtual self (or selves) that she is enacting or simply witnessing (its unclear whether she has any agency in this). All realities are equally real to her and as the film progresses she becomes more and more lost to any singular originary self.<br /><br />One of her selves is a smoldering 1940's femme fatale that she is cast to play in a film within a film and another is a prim and pregnant barefoot housewife and another is a call girl in what looks like a Fiona Apple video but all are emanations from \\"Laura Dern's\\" own fragmented consciousness. Her 1940's self is helped along by a film script directed by film within a film director Jeremy Irons that requires/allows her to play the part of an adulterous southern belle but this is more than a mere role for the playing of it is informed by very real desires to rebel against the constraints and pressures of her more subdued self/reality and to enjoy in the hidden country of cinema and art and dreams what is taboo and what is forbidden without any inhibition whatsoever. But one or two selves or realites will not suffice...<br /><br />Under her own watchful gaze her selves and realities continue to multiply. Almost like an audience member, or some impassive spectator to her own multiple performances, she witnesses her life become a kaliedoscopic swirl of virtual selves and realites with no actual center.<br /><br />Identity crisis has never been so inticing, so sexy, so dangerous, so dizzying, and so creepy.<br /><br />Lynch even throws in some Bunny theatre for good measure (perhaps as a kind of meta-comment on arts inability to make heads or tails of our chaotic existence).<br /><br />This is intensely enjoyable for lovers of the avant-garde and/or lovers of psychological horror films like Polanski's Repulsion, Roeg's Don't Look Now, Kubrick's The Shining, and Lynch's own Mulholland Drive.en country of cinema and art and dreams what is taboo and what is forbidden without any inhibition whatsoever.

0446579939|3.0|I just finished Nicholas Sparks latest book and okay I'm in the minority here but it was just so-so. IT seemed very much like some of his other books.  Guy meets girl under interesting circumstances; there's a child and dog of course.  They fall in love but the guy (usually the guy) does something upsetting and they separate only to get back together at the end or one of them dies. It's a given someone has to die.  Maybe not always one of the couple but at least one of the main characters.<br /><br />I found Logan a likable character and also Beth's son. Beth is somewhat annoying!  I never could warm up to her a lot. She doesn't like any military man because her brother was killed by friendly fire?  Okay that's real mature! She falls in love with Logan and though he has done nothing but help her and her grandmother and her son, it seems like she's always trying to find something wrong with him and when her sleeze of a husband tells her Logan has carried her picture and came there to find her, she takes this as gospel and she tears Logan apart even throwing a vase at him. Again very mature! She won't even allow him to explain.  I think I would have found it quite romantic if a man had carried my picture and walked across country to put a real person to that face.  In no sense did he ever act like a stalker.  So by the next day she's ready to forgive him. Oh how big of her.  If he had told her in the beginning she would have had the same reaction and then Logan would never have got to know the family or help her and the grandmother.  Oh there wouldn't have been a story either.<br /><br />Then the ending leaves a lot. There is no explanation of what happened in the river during the storm. Two men are drowning and the next chapter is the Epilogue.  What happened in the water??  Then suddenly this sleeze of a husband is a great guy?  Huh!<br /><br />On a more positive note, I do appreciate the fact there is a lack of profanity in Mr. Sparks books and though there are love scenes they are not graphic.  I do think Mr. Sparks is a talented writer but was just a bit disappointed in the development of especially Beth's character in this book. I did think this book was rather wordy with whole chapters of someone's thoughts. I guess that was to get to know that character better but I found myself skimming at those points.<br /><br />It's not really a bad book and someone else may look at the characters differently than I, so I would still recommend it as a good read.raphic.

Presently I much love Sharon Shinn's Thirteenth House series. I find Paolini's series most interesting and am amazed at how so young a writer can do so very well. I think, like others, that there is too much violence in this last book but over all, I am kept interested and have found it quite enjoyable. This young man has a great future ahead of him.

3527406018|5.0|Griffith's book is a straight-forward and easy-to-follow introduction to particle physics. The book doesn't require the reader to have much background in particle physics, mostly just quantum mechanics and Lagrangian physics. Quantum field theory is definitely not necessary to learn from this book, although it'll probably be helpful.<br /><br />The book focuses more on \\"how\\" rather than \\"why,\\" so it's a great starting point for experimentalists. Griffith's writes in a very casual and simple style; you won't find much mathematical jargon here. I'd recommend this book over [[ASIN:0471887412 Quarks and Leptons: An Introductory Course in Modern Particle Physics]]. Once you learn from this text the basics of the Standard Model and how to calculate amplitudes, cross-sections, decay rates, etc., you'll be ready to move on to more theoretical material (such as [[ASIN:0471887412 Quarks and Leptons: An Introductory Course in Modern Particle Physics]]) to answer the question of \\"why.\\"
0143142356|4.0|My wife and listened to Pillars of the Earth on a long road trip in March 2008. We were both completely enthralled, and we knew as soon as we finished it that we had to listen to the sequel.<br /><br />World Without End is read by the same actor, and he is wonderful. Great voices, perfect delivery. I couldn't ask for a better reader.<br /><br />The story, however, leaves a bit to be desired. The first thing you'll notice is the similarity between the characters (love story between a kind-hearted builder and a rebellious, intelligent woman; a wannabe knight with no conscience; a conniving religious leader taking advantage of his role). Also, the political maneuvering seems to come naturally to most of the characters, which somehow makes the conflicts less interesting (in Pillars, I liked seeing Tom and Philip learn how to work the system in ways that didn't really seem to match their personalities).  And, Follett seemed a little more afraid to take risks in this one (there were sections of Pillars that were so bleak they almost made me want to stop reading, but even the plague isn't that bad in World Without End).<br /><br />Having said all that, it's still very enjoyable. I care about the characters in this book as much (or almost as much) as I did about Tom, Ellen, and Philip. If you haven't read Pillars, don't even think of reading World Without End until you've read that first (not that there's lots of connections; it's just better). But if you have read and enjoyed Pillars, you'll probably like World Without End too.
B001DCQIAU|5.0|Admirers of Karajan will probably own most or all of these symphony cycles from what was probably the pinnacle of the conductor's prolific career.  However, if you are unfamiliar with Karajan's work, or well enough acquainted with it to desire further exploration, then this amazingly inexpensive anthology can be enthusiastically recommended.  I purchased all of these sets when they came out in DG's previous mid-priced \\"Karajan Symphony Edition,\\" and I can testify to their consistently oustanding quality, both as performances and as interpretations.  As recordings, however, it must be admitted that the sound is of variable quality; sometimes admirably vivid and well balanced, but frequently tending toward harshness, even garishness--particularly in those which come from the early digital era (cf. Bruckner's symphonies 1-3).  Too bad Universal didn't see fit to give this magnificent legacy a sonic facelift.  Still, the performances are sufficiently worthy of your attention to warrant purchase regardless of these sonic limitations.<br /><br />Here is a brief rundown of the symphony cycles included in this box:<br /><br />1.  Haydn \\"Paris\\" and \\"London\\" symphonies (nos. 82-87 and 93-104):  We don't usually think of Karajan as a great Haydn interpreter, but the evidence belies that impression.  His recorded legacy contains quite a lot of the composer's music including these two symphony sets, two versions of *Creation* (DG), *The Seasons* (EMI) plus some miscellaneous symphonies (82, 83, 104, also for EMI).  The Haydn symphonies included in this box are, to be sure, given the \\"big band\\" treatment; nevertheless, they have a spring to their step as well as a warmth and, where appropriate, a dramatic urgency, which mostly keeps them from sounding turgid or languid.  Karajan generally favors upbeat tempos and though, as we might expect, textures are blended and phrasing smooth, Haydn's wit and sparkle survive intact. Only the slow and stately  Menuettos might prove controversial, though many modern-orchestra conductors, such as Bernstein, Dorati and Solti favor a similar approach to these movements. In the end, Karajan would not be my first choice in this repertoire:  I prefer the earthier Bernstein in the Paris group and the leaner, more vibrant Solti in the London.  But Karajan's Haydn is not to be dismissed; he brings a combination of majesty and elegance which is often surprisingly convincing.<br /><br />Mozart Symphonies (33, 35-41):  I am less enamored of Karajan's Mozart than his Haydn.  The conductor was at his best in Mozart in his younger days; his finest batch of Mozart symphonies come from Vienna and the Philharmonia in the 1950's (check out EMI's omnibus Karajan edition for these).  Those earlier performances have a vitality and leanness of texture which the DG performances from the 1970's lack.  On the other hand, it is possible to enjoy, even revel in, the glorious sounds of the BPO while disregarding the overly sleek, and sometimes bloated, textures Karajan evoked in later years.  Again, not a first choice in this repertoire (I prefer Beecham, Klemperer, Walter and Szell), but worth hearing.<br /><br />Beethoven Symphonies 1-9 and Selected Overtures:  DG have given us the 1977 cycle here, not the better-known and more commonly recommended cycle from the early Sixties.  In all, Karajan gave us four Beethoven Symphony cycles:  One for EMI (with the Philharmonia, in Mono), and three for DG (one from each decade after 1960).  He also recorded miscellaneous Beethoven symphonies in Vienna during the late '40's.  In general, I prefer his earliest efforts in Beethoven, which have a clarity and incisiveness Karajan would only intermittently realize in his two stereo and one digital Beethoven cycles.  Yet there is no denying that the 1977 cycle is an remarkable accomplishment.  In many ways the interpretations seem fresher and more spontaneous than those from the early '60's.  In 1977, the *Eroica* blazes fiercely at somewhat hectic speeds in the outer movements and the Ninth is nothing short of overwhelming in its elemental power.  The Sixth is definitely more congenial in 1977; the earlier Berlin version sounded uncomfortably rigid and businesslike, at very brisk tempos.  Otherwise, there's not much difference between the two Stereo cycles, except that the interpretations in 1963 seem less focused, or fully formed, than in 1977.<br /><br />Schumann Symphonies 1-4:  If you were introduced to Schumann's chimerical muse through Bernstein's classic set of the four symphonies, Karajan may strike you as too level-headed, even stuffy.  He certainly doesn't convey the manic-depressive qualities in Schumann's music as effectively as Bernstein.  On the other hand, Karajan does convey a breadth and almost Brucknerian majesty in no. 2 that is quite unique.  A glorious performance.  The Fourth is also superlative--the only version that can seriously rival Furtw&auml;ngler's classic account for its control of tempo, transition and texture.  The \\"Spring\\" and \\"Rhenish\\" are also very fine: sumptuously played, beautifully crafted, intelligently structured--but wanting in spontaneity.<br /><br />Mendelssohn Symphonies 1-5:  A surprise, perhaps, that Karajan should prove such a sympathetic Mendelssohn interpreter, but so it is.  This is, in my estimation, the most involving Mendelssohn cycle ever recorded; it easily surpasses Abbado, Dohnanyi, and Sawallisch (among those cycles with which I am familiar).  Karajan evokes playing from the BPO that is little short of glorious in all five symphonies.  His tempos seem just right (not too breathless in the Scottish and the Italian) and his strong advocacy of the two lesser-known works (the early c-minor, no. 1, and the once-popular *Lobgesang*, no 2) may convince you that their relative  neglect is unwarranted.  The *Lobgesang* in particular is given an affectionate, expansive, and--in the Choral finale--exultant reading that makes it a prime recommendation for this work.  Only the \\"Reformation\\" disappoints on account of its rather inflated rhetoric--though no more so, perhaps, than many other versions.<br /><br />Brahms symphonies 1-4, plus Tragic Overture and Haydn Variations:  Brahms was one of Karajan's specialties; he recorded at least four complete cycles plus numerous miscellaneous versions of particular symphonies at different times in his career.  The cycle included here probably represents his most mature thoughts on a composer for whom he had a particular affinity.  These are warm, yet dramatically compelling accounts, in which every detail takes its place within a clearly-articulated structure.  The same goes for the Haydn Variations and Tragic Overture.  If, in the end, Furtw&auml;ngler, Klemperer and Walter brought special insights to these works that Karajan's more generalized interpretations cannot match, Karajan is certainly leagues ahead of the many faceless or tendentious Brahms cycles that have come our way since the 1970's.  A strong recommendation, then, even though one might want to supplement these recordings with those by the conductors listed above.<br /><br />Bruckner Symphonies 1-9:  For a more complete exposition, see my Amazon.com review of this classic Bruckner cycle for the older \\"Karajan Edition.\\"  Suffice it to say here that Karajan was one of the half-dozen greatest interpreters of this composer.  His Bruckner tends toward the Olympian in its loftiness, grandeur and spaciousness.  Though by no means chilly, Karajan's take on this composer is neither intimate nor humane, but rather stresses the sublimity, even the remoteness, of these vast symphonic mountain-peaks.  He is at his best in 1, 4, 5, 7-9.  The others offer superb playing, but are either subverted by strident early-digital recording (particularly atrocious in the case of no. 3), or compromised by a less than fully sympathetic interpretation (2 and 6).<br /><br />Tchaikovsky Symphonies 1-6:  Karajan recorded Symphonies 4, 5 and 6 somany times one loses track of them all!  If nothing else, this proliferation of recordings indicates that Karajan took the composer seriously; not for him a condescending attitude toward Tchaikovsky!  Among his many versions of the Final Three (and I have heard most of them), my preference would be for those with the BPO from the 1960's (one traversal for EMI, another for DG, as I recall).  Karajan peaked as a Tchaikovsky interpreter during that decade; thereafter a certain staleness crept into his renditions of 4-6, for all their rhetorical power.  On the other hand, Karajan's only recording of the three early symphonies, also included in this complete set, represent a fresh encounter with the music, and for this reason they sound as vital and atmospheric as one could wish.  Indeed, these are among the very best versions available of the \\"Winter Dreams, \\"Little Russian\\" and \\"Polish\\" symphonies.  Some critics have found them more \\"Teutonic\\" than \\"Slavic,\\" but I tend to disagree.  If by \\"Slavic\\" one means \\"prone to emotional extremes, darkly brooding and effusively sentimental\\"; and if by \\"Teutonic\\" one means \\"given to rigor, order, and discipline\\"; then the foregoing assessment is based on cultural stereotypes not responsible criticism. In fact, Karajan's renditions of these early symphonies are both emotionally charged and intellectually rigorous; an ideal combination, in my estimation, and one that reveals Tchaikovsky as a master symphonist even at this relatively early stage in his career.<br /><br />In sum, then, this massive box provides a superb survey of Karajan's genius at full stretch, warts and all.  The recordings do not always fall pleasantly on the ear, but the BPO's collective virtuosity, beyond praise, amply compensates for sonic limitations.  And the price is definitely right.

Peppered with witty lines and anecdotes, the main story line will literally cause you to laugh out loud one page and cry uncontrollably the next. Written for young adults, it is still a treasure for an older crowd and will bring you back to what its like stumbling your way through the real world, but may also bring you new discoveries about yourself and how you see the world. Now stop reading this review and go read the gosh darned book... Seriously...
B00001R3HX|4.0|This 1993 release seems to be a bit overlooked and I am not quite sure why; all of the elements of the Porcupine Tree sound are in place.  Come to think of it, in that Up the Downstair (1993) is still more or a less a Steve Wilson solo album, this is somewhat surprising.  I actually like this release quite a lot and certainly rank it right up there with great albums from the \\"space-rock\\" period like The Sky Moves Sideways (1995) and Signify (1996).<br /><br />Up the Downstair was \\"programmed, produced, and performed\\" by Steve Wilson (lead vocals, acoustic and electric guitars, synthesizers, keyboards, drum programming, and drums).  He is however, helped out by Colin Edwin (electric bass guitar on Track 4) and Richard Barbieri (synthesizers on Track 5), both of whom would join Steve full time on The Sky Moves Sideways.  Other additional musicians include Suzanne Barbieri (voice on Track 5).<br /><br />The ten tracks on this Delerium Records release range in length from the spoken word introduction (0:58) to 11:06 (Burning Sky) - the tracks bleed into one another, so there is the sense that this one large Up the Downstair \\"suite\\".  Musically, this is probably the spaciest album in the entire Porcupine Tree discography - large sections of the album are dominated by ambient soundscapes generated on synthesizers.  There are a few relatively heavier moments too when all of the instruments are going ahead full steam, but not so heavy that they stand out.  Intermixed with the instrumental passages are fairly nice and gloomy \\"songs\\" that feature great vocals from Steve, influences of groups such as The Orb, and other effects including snippets of pre-recorded passages of spoken words.  The introduction is a good example whereby a somewhat dry male voice indicates that \\"this is music played by musicians under the influence of a mind-altering chemical called...\\".  Unfortunately, a few holdovers from the previous album Sunday of Life (1991) pop up here and there that do not sound as organic as the rest of the material, including the drum programming.  These moments are far and few between, so the listening experience is not affected.<br /><br />This Delerium Records release is pretty good and features good sound quality and an insert that features the lyrics to each track along with personnel listing.  I like it enough that I have not bothered to get the remastered 2 CD version. Total running time is 47:54.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great album that marks the emergence of the definitive Porcupine Tree sound and is recommended to those folks that like the spacier sound of early albums such as The Sky Moves Sideways and Signify.he rest of the material, including the drum programming.

1440423911|5.0|Dickens, it's said, created the British image of Christmas.<br /><br />It would be a ridiculous but interesting challenge to name the world's most successful or influential work of fiction, but if it were attempted, this novella would be a strong contender. Crafted with all the brilliant wit and imagery of which Dickens was capable, it chronicles the redemption of an aging skinflint, rendered bitter and cruel by his passion for money, to whom life has become a trudge towards the grave.<br /><br />Joy and love Ebenezer Scrooge has barred from his life, and for this, as his dead partner's ghost warns him, he is doomed to wander the Earth after death, chained by his hoarded loot. Yet he is to be rescued by the spirit - spirits actually: three of them - that burn hot and bright with forgiveness and hope amid the snow and of this darkest, final month.<br /><br />Dickens wrote this tale as a protest in 1843, against the even then growing obsession with material wealth, and neglect of life's freely given riches. Tnd today its message is as strong and apt as ever. To me, Christmas has not arrived until I've seen it told yet again in one of its many film adaptations, be it the black & white 1951 version starring Alastair Sim, or one of the later versions in which George C. Scott, Albert Finney, Patrick Stewart and many others have portrayed the old miser. This rich and unashamed snatch at our heartstrings never fails to pluck mine.
0670034711|4.0|Interesting, insightful and honest.  Easy to read.  Women are often accused of being self-absorbed when they simply are living for themselves.  Who else should she live for?  Self-centered is not a bad thing, if the self is striving for truth and happiness.  And look what she achieved in the process: a home for her Balinese friend, a book enjoyed and loved by many (even if reviled by some), enriching experiences for herself and many of the people with whom she formed bounds on her journey.  Would her time have been better spent working for a corporation, having and caring for a baby she didn't want? Being true to yourself seems a better choice.
0316113506|4.0|Spark explains the burgeoning research into how exercise is one of the key ingredients missing in the modern Western lifestyle. The author uses numerous anecdotal, statistical and research based examples to make a compelling case for improving quality of life during any phase by simply moving.<br /><br />Depressed? Exercise! Injured? Exercise! Obese? Exercise.<br /><br />Spark is an important book because the idea that you might just be able to replace your Lexapro prescription with an hour of Dance Dance Revolution per day is hugely important. The idea that your brain chemistry and your ability to feel good is largely based on how much you move is hugely important.<br /><br />I happened to find Spark about a year into a rejuvenation of my own health through exercise so let me add my own anecdotal evidence - exercise can and did allow me to get through depression, panic attacks and has helped me with what is probably a mild case of ADD or ADHD - conditions I once scoffed at as made up.<br /><br />Spark is a convincing tome. If it cannot get you to stop popping pills and start exercising ever day, nothing will. I did not give Spark five stars because some of the explanations of how brain chemistry works are a little complex for the general reading public.

B000002LKF|5.0|I remember buying this album in high school in early 1990. I haven't had a copy of it in ages, but I recently purchased it again, along with one for my mother as a christmas gift. I like Paul Simon's lyrics especially, because every song sounds like a story being told. I love \\"world\\" music, so this one along with Graceland really keeps my attention. Timeless!

0307455874|5.0|I was very interested in this years presidential race, because of the problems that this country faces. Back when the candidates were first vying for position, it was exciting to watch who was rising to the top. At the beginning I didn't think Mr. Obama had much of a chance being that he was young, unknown, inexperienced, etc. The more that I listen to him talk on the TV and the radio the more I become convince that this was the person, out of all the others, who had the character and the savvy to lead and remake this United States of America into a country that we all can be proud of again.     The book helped me get into his mind and way of thinking a bit. A very fast and insightful read. I would like for him to write more books while in the presidency so we could get  more of an in depth analysis on the working of government in action as he sees it happen in real time, but I guess we will have to wait until he leaves office, because maybe President Obama is going to have his hands full of other pressing matters.

The cast is absolutely amazing! Anna Paquin as Sookie and Stephen Moyer as Bill have so much chemistry that they pretty much explode on screen.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|I do not usually write review;however, this is the best miniseries i have ever watched. HBO always has great shows and movies, but with this one i was  upset when it was over, i wanted to watch more. The acting is great, and the story is unbelievable, you learn a lot about the history of the United States, and especially John Adams, who does not get as much credit in the role of our country's history as he deserves.     If you like history, or just a great story, i would pick up this box set. I bought it when it was almost 60 dollars, now its 39.99, very god deal.
B0016OMFPW|5.0|As soon as I heard the first few bars of the first track on this CD, I knew I was going to love it. I've been a fan of trumpeter Roy Hargrove's for some time now and while this is a very different from the last album of his I bought (2003's hip-hop influenced [[ASIN:B000084T3J The RH Factor: Hard Groove]]), it has that beautifully delicious blend that I adore when it comes to modern jazz; great songs played by quality musicians, putting in quality performances, without trying to be too clever or excessively complicated. These guys don't give the impression of wanting to talk down to the target audience - whether deliberately or inadvertently. (And yes, Mr Redman, I'm talking to you).<br /><br />The album sounds like it was a lot of fun to make. It's definitely a lot of fun to listen to and you don't need a degree in music to enjoy it. Indeed, on the inner-sleeve notes, Hargove describes \\"Earfood\\" as \\"Sound Nutrition\\" and says the recording 'was made to bring sonic pleasure to the listener'. He's more than achieved his aim as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />The quintet is made up of Hargrove on trumpet & flugelhorn, Justin Robinson on alto sax & flute, Gerald Clayton on piano, Danton Boller on bass and Montez Coleman on drums - brilliant musicians all, and they give some absolutely beautiful solos.<br /><br />I love the kicker album opener, \\"I'm Not So Sure\\" (written by Cedar Walton); the ballads \\"Brown\\" (Hargrove); \\"Starmaker\\" (Lou Marini) and \\"Joy Is Sorrow Unmasked\\" (Hargrove); the upbeat \\"The Stinger\\" (Hargrove); \\"Style\\" and \\"Divine\\" (both by Hargrove), another two fine ballads; the intriguing \\"To Wisdom The Prize\\" (Larry Willis) and \\"Speak Low\\" (Kurt Weill & Ogden Nash) yet another ballad that almost reduces me to tears every time I hear it. A live performance of the Sam Cooke oldie, \\"Bring It On Home To Me\\" rounds off the CD brilliantly. (I don't know what happened but my copy does not contain the song \\"Yemenja\\" listed up there. Maybe it's only available on the MP3 album? I don't really care).<br /><br />And I almost forgot \\"Strasbourg / St. Denis\\". While a lovely song in its own right, it always makes me smile because I have very fond memories of the Paris neighbourhood and Metro station from which I presume it gets its name.<br /><br />But really, this is all good. 13 great tunes, produced by Larry Clothier and Roy Hargrove, and recorded & mixed by the legendary Al Schmitt. I just love it. I reckon it's my favourite jazz CD of this year.eally care).    And I almost forgot \\"Strasbourg / St. Denis\\".

031606792X|1.0|The only time Bella really suffered was when Edward left in New Moon and during the birth scene. I admit that I only read mostly 2 out of the 3 parts of Breaking Dawn but I know everything that happens. However the book is awful. I have the same problems that all of the negative reviewers have, but I have a problem with something else also. The whole series is a dud. Nothing really happens. No one suffers (besides the two exceptions that I noted above). Every book follows the same pattern. 9/10ths of the book is eye candy and infaturation between Bella and Edward. During this, the story builds up to villain confrontation. Then the \\"Epic\\" battle scene takes place and lasts for only a few pages. It felt like Meyer swinging the baseball bat to strike a homerun but it ends with a bunt. After 500 pages, villains and heros take each other on, but it ends quickly. Meyer seems to only introduce her villains near the end rather the beggining. If she did introduce them in the beggining, there would be more struggle in the story and will keep the reader totaly hooked. Ex) \\"OH my gosh will the Human Torch prevent Dr. Doom from destroying the world?!\\" Have you ever been addicted like that to a tv show, movie, or book before? Probably. Have ever felt like that with Meyer's books? Did you ever feel an adrenaline rush and your own heart racing while watching a car chase scene? Did you ANYWHERE in Meyer's books? Did you feel and share the same feelings of victoy and suffering with characters like Bella or Charlisle? Most people don't in Meyer's stories. Meyer loves her characters too much to let anything exciting or dangerous happen to them. I'll give you an example. Edward constantly says to Bella that he can't be with Bella because that he is a \\"Vampire\\" and that he might try to suck her blood. This NEVER happens in the whole series. What if Edward really did attack Bella or even her father Charlie? This would have created so much healthy conflict for the story and would really improve the plot. The fact is that readers can't trust Meyer. It would hook them if Meyer actually proves that Bella and her loved ones are in fatal danger from her relationship with Edward. This would help the Twilght series live up to the title of \\" Forbidden Love\\".
0956010903|5.0|Oh, don't listen to the naysayers.  This is a gorgeous reproduction of the original 7 hand-sewn books.  Did I expect it to be 'worth' $100?  Of course not!  It's a fund-raiser for a very worthy charity. As a HP fan and a book artist, it's a lovely Christmas present to myself.  My son, also a Harry fan, will get the standard edition, and we will enjoy reading the stories and commentaries together.
B001GQACGO|2.0|There's something rather camp about Ms Knowles' new album. From the title and cover imagery that scream drag queen alter ego (at least to this gay man), to the rumours that she'd recently been visiting gay clubs incognito, just to check out how men who dress up as women pretending to be her actually carry it off, the album definitely has the suggestion of some acculturation - at the very least, in terms of her musical and stage persona evolution. A woman ostensibly learning moves from men who would want to be women? I find that interesting.<br /><br />Even the lead single \\"If I Were A Boy\\" has elements that make it interesting in terms of sexual politics. When was the last time we heard a dude singing about what he would do if he were a girl?<br /><br />Ms Knowles explains it differently, of course. \\"There's my personal life, my sensitive side, and then me as a performer, sexy and energized and fun,\\" she said in a recent article in \\"The New York Times\\". So it probably won't be a surprise to anyone reading this that the album is a two-disc set. Disc One (\\"I Am...\\") is a set of ballads, and although they are well sung (with a surprising lack of vocal acrobatics) and well produced, I found them immediately forgettable. Some of the songs - \\"If I Were A Boy\\", \\"Disappear\\" \\"mash Into You\\" and \\"That's Why You're Beautiful\\" - are slightly less forgettable than others but still. One track, \\"Ave Maria\\", did stand out but for all the wrong reasons: it made me cringe. It wasn't bad enough to propel me from my seat to go push the forward button but I was definitely willing it to end. Not a good sign.<br /><br />Disc Two (\\"Sasha Fierce\\", which takes its name from Beyonc&eacute;'s well publicised onstage alter ego) is more upbeat and much more like what I've grown to expect - or even want - from a Beyonc&eacute; CD. Tracks like \\"Radio\\" and \\"Diva\\" strive to make their mark with beats made popular by people like T-Pain and Lil Wayne but to me it's all very predictable and samey-samey, almost to the point of tedium. \\"Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)\\" is decent enough and I can already imagine that one going down a storm in the clubs. Check out the YouTube clip of Shane Mercado dancing to the tune and you'll see what I mean. \\"Ego\\" threatens to be a good song but never quite delivers. It's all a bit of a let down, really.<br /><br />Musically, I find this album heartbreaking. Good melodies seem to have been consigned to the history books. I was beginning to think that I was just too old for this kind of stuff now, that younger people and the trendy iPod & BlackBerry set would probably love it. After all, for instance, when she sings suggestively about being watched on a videophone on the annoying, headache-inducing song \\"Video Phone\\", I thought to myself surely you'd have to own one of those to be in on the joke? I don't, on both counts.<br /><br />But apparently, judging from some of the other reviews of this product, this is not about age. It seems it would be about music that just isn't that good. It would seem that this album is not being received very well by the buying public in general.<br /><br />I read in the aforementioned article in \\"The New York Times\\" that Beyonc&eacute; wants to 'reach out for a wider audience' - to fans of people like John Mayer and Carrie Underwood with this album and by that I guess she means people who wouldn't ordinarily check out the r&b stuff she's made her name with. I like Beyonc&eacute; and so I hope it works out but personally, I would be very surprised if this album outsold any of her previous ones. It entered the album charts here at a slightly disappointing #10 and has since slipped to #21, so from this side of the Atlantic it's not looking too good at the moment. (\\"If I Were A Boy\\", which I concede is a thought provoking song with a cool, thought provoking video, did make the #1 singles spot for a week but has since been knocked down to #2 by Take That's \\"Greatest Day\\". Just imagine).<br /><br />The NYT article also implies that there are influences from Etta James on the album (Beyonc&eacute; is due to appear in a movie based on the legendary singer's life called \\"Cadillac Records\\") but personally, I hear no evidence of that. Playing the role may have given her the confidence to venture outside of her comfort zone though, which sits well with her claim that she wishes to reach a wider audience.<br /><br />What is difficult to argue with is the assertion that the role made her wish to express herself more directly and honestly. \\"I was a lot more bold and fearless after I played Etta James, because of course some of the character stays with you. Some of the music I would have been afraid to make, I wasn't. I got more guts, more confidence as a human being,\\" she said later on in the article.<br /><br />More power to her. Beyonc&eacute; is credited as co-writer on almost every song, with no fewer than 32 songwriters and 19 producers also credited. On paper, it looks like a massive undertaking. To me, it just doesn't amount to much. And interestingly, there are no guest performances, not even from hubby Jay-Z.<br /><br />Beyonc&eacute; Knowles is obviously a very talented and hard working young woman and I can do nothing but respect her. With this album though, I am decidedly underwhelmed.(Beyoncé is due to appear in a movie based on the legendary singer's life called \\"Cadillac Records\\") but personally, I hear no evidence of that.

B001GQACGE|5.0|I was disgusted to read some of these comments... You all knew how many tracks there were before you bought the 2 cd set - yes they could all fit on one cd... but you should have known.    Im reviewing the music - not the marketing.    Sure, some of the tracks are not going to be on my playlist... thats normal when buying an album... but for those tracks i like and some i love - its all worth it. I will also add... some of the tracks i did not like on B-day turned out to be fantastic when performed live ( where she really shines )    She is one of the best young talented artists out there - lets not forget that.    Please think before you review.

This fabrication along with the spotting of the abominable snowmen makes me think the book is longer on fiction than fact, although the premise may be absolutely true.    It was still an enjoyable read if inconsistent with reality.
1595141715|4.0|... and you'll begin the story that may very well change your outlook on everything. When Clay Jenson comes home to find a box full of cassette tapes on his doorstep,with no return address, he can't help but be anything but eager to find out what's on them... that is until he presses play. Hannah Baker is dead but that doesn't mean she's left us behind entirely because that's exactly who's on the tapes~speaking to him.<br />This story takes readers on an all night rollercoaster ride of pent up emotions. Hannah may have killed herself, but was she really the cause? Could you have knowingly or unknowingly contributed to the too early departure of someone you barely knew? That is the lurking question throughout this thought-provoking debut novel by Jay Asher. Readers will identify with both Hannah's yearning to belong candidly disguised by her cynical humor and Clay's ever present curiousity that won't allow him to stop listening to the dead girl speaking to him.<br /><br />By the time that you close this book you will think twice about everything you say, and the way it will inadvertently effect someone else. From starting a rumor, to betraying a friend, this book covers things that are so prevalent amongst today's youths. Though knowing the end of this sad story before you even begin to read, with Hannah's voice hauntingly speaking within the pages,\\"Thirteen Reasons Why\\" makes you hope, believe, and pray, that somehow someone,ANYONE, will be able to save her. This book is definately one for anybody who has ever considered themselves unimportant, because it proves that we have the ability to ultimately influence the actions of others around us.

B0013D8LOK|4.0|Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp), a barber embittered by the destruction of his family and his own unjust imprisonment, returns to London filled with bloodlust and anger, thirsting for revenge against the man responsible for his family's downfall (Alan Rickman).  While waiting for his big chance, he slaughters scores of customers, who are then recycled into meat pies served by Todd's accomplice and would-be lover, Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter).    Once again, director Tim Burton has found a fitting subject for his unique sensibility.  His London is a dark, creepy warren of twisting back alleys and dank sewers.  He does not compromise the basic savagery of this story, presenting a musical that features more blood than most slasher films.  The reprehensible nature most of the characters is not prettied up for the screen; each of them is taken to their logical extreme and meets a richly deserved fate.  I haven't seen the show as presented on stage, so I can't comment on how it compares to this compressed version, but I found the film to be quite satisfying in its own right (with the exception of one \\"surprise\\" that I saw coming from a mile away).  The actors, who are not noted for their singing ability, acquit themselves well with Stephen Sondheim's excellent score.
B001DTPZNY|2.0|Without giving away the end i will just say you are better off passing on this movie. Indy has always been my fav movie charecter but this movie ruined the memory.  I even thought George Lucas was brilliant for his historic films. Seeing this i realized what a 1 trick Pony he really is.   I wanted to give it 1 star. I have waved all my friends/family away. There is a reason the movie is already in the Budget Bin for a new release. It gets 2 stars for nostalgia only.
B001K7IHYS|5.0|While I haven't read it yet, I can tell already it was worth every cent. It is absolutely beautiful. I never take time to review a product, but this one really does have that WOW factor that makes you want to tell everyone about it.
B00003CX9E|5.0|I watched this movie for the first time in english class. I had to write a paper of 8 pages about it. I was amazed by all the elements and interested in what \\"Rosebud\\" was. I will admit that I still cry at the end of this movie because like Kane, some of us has lost a something so precious when we are kids that even when the money we have now, we cannot replace it. The music score doesn't help to hold the tears. Just magnificent how a man that was thought to have everything had nothing.
B001E7OO2I|5.0|I LOVE THIS CD...can't stop listening to it.  No it's not your typical R&B CD...don't think that's its intention. But it's definitely FRESH AND NEW...and if that's what you're looking for...with some AWESOME lyrical content...you have it with EVOLVER! There's a nice blend of ballads, mellow and uptempo songs.  My FAVORITES are...YOU LOVE, I LOVE...gorgeous melody, it draws you in. It's one of those \\"song cries\\". Quickly, is another one I like alot.  I mean...my 6yr. old nephew LOVES this song...remembered the lyrics and the song track #. I was thrown off at first to hear Brandy...but she's grown on me.  I LOVE THE LYRICS.  It's a listener from beginning to end.  Be open, relax and enjoy!

B001GKJ2DY|5.0|I love this movie! As I sing the songs with my daughter, holding Hannah Montana microphone, and dance around the house, I am giving birth to me that once was. The fun girl, the out of control, fully alive girl. I have not been alive for the longest time and this movie rejuvenated me back to the book of living.  It was 1974 when ABBA first touched my heart and got me dancing to the incredible beat of Waterloo. Then the words meant nothing to me as an 8 year old me hadn't yet been introduced to the secrets of a proverbial heart. It was simply innocence in motion as I flew around my uncle's house affirming that ABBA will win the Eurovision song contest and they'll be huge. A few hours later my prophecy came to be.  33 years later that song means something to me. Even better \\"The winner takes it all\\" is my life in a song,\\"SOS\\" pleads my pain and confusion and \\"Slipping through my fingers\\" makes me weep like only a mother can. My life unfolds as I emerge into this corny yet so fascinating and skillfully cast musical of pure bliss and pleasure.  The young man,Sky,gets my heart racing but the sight of Colin Firth,Stellan Skarsgard and Pierce Brosnan brings me back to my age, with passion, and I see the threaded years becoming more appreciated as I drool over the older guys. It is great to be a mature woman and have these boyish and still hot as heat hunks enchanting all my sense buds from here to heaven. I am in love with all three of them, at the same time.  For all you hopeless romantics, once hurt twice-shy or simply the ones whom just want to enjoy a moment in time when everything else stops and bliss and sheer, bubbly fun takes over the whole body and sets you free to be silly,corny and goofy. Enjoy with all your might and keep on going back to that happy place over and over again.  I have passed on to a new generation of ABBA fans, my daughter is 6 years old and enchanted by this music.

The craftsmanship is excellent and it makes the perfect addition to all of my other special or limited edition Harry Potter books. Sure, I could have lived with the standard edition, but this looks great on the ledge in the study next to my other limited edition copies. Thank you Amazon!
B0000DJE9R|4.0|This is a great album for Michael Jackson's best hits.  There was only one problem that really annoyed me: it sounds like they tweaked the beginning of \\"Thriller.\\" Instead of the usual \\"footsteps\\" intro, it starts with a synthetic-sounding version of the opening trumpet fanfare.  Honestly, that ruined the whole song for me.  I can't believe no one else has mentioned this...
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is one kick-butt workout.  It has to be hard to give you the promised results of losing 20 pounds in 30 days.  I am 100 pounds overweight and barely ever workout and have been doing this workout for the last 3 days.  It is hard!!!  The first day I made it through not even 10 minutes of it and just sat and watched the rest, but I am already seeing an improvement in my strength and endurance.  It is so easy to squeeze a 20 minute workout into my day and this workout really makes me feel like I have done something.  I am looking forward to seeing what kind of results I have at the end of the month (even with the holidays).  There are modified ways of doing the exercises for beginners and those who are more advanced.  If you want a workout that will challenge you and get you results NOW then this is the DVD for you, but be warned it is hard.  I love the circuits to this DVD (3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio, and 1 minute of abs).  It's easier to get through because you can think the whole time I only have to do this one exercise for 1 minute or 30 seconds.  This is make you hurt and you will feel it the next day.  Good luck!
B000002UBB|5.0|I listen to \\"Serenade\\" as I write this : simply classic.<br />Don't miss this!  Torrent most SM -- buy this one!
B001GKJ2FC|4.0|Video: 5/5<br />This bluray looks incredible. A nice transfer, it just looks really good.<br /><br />Audio: 5/5<br />The sound is crisp, and hits hard. A good choice to showoff your surround sound system<br /><br />Movie: 4/5<br />The movie is actually fun to watch. Not for the serious, picky people, but for the ones who seek instant action.
0385340990|5.0|Lovely enjoyable book!  Characters are so real you wish you could become their best friends - or worst enemies! (for the evil characters!)  It also brings history home in such a human way.  The characters do remind me of so many real people I know and are dear to me.  Makes me want to take the real people and hold them as close to me as I do this choice book.  Such an affirmation of the human spirit and just a good happy cry book.  Everything that I love in a good book.  Read it, you'll love it as much as I did.
0316286850|5.0|You need this book! It is a bible to make-up artists, drag queens and anyone who wants to know how to put on make-up.  everything is covered and explained from the tools you need, the make-up types and plenty of classic looks along with beautiful theme looks.  Everything is laid out and made simple with diagrams and easy to follow instructions.  Sit down with your make-up, a jar of remover and practice and follow.  You'll become quite practiced.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This show was one of those that I found after all three parts were up online.  I watched it right away, anything with NPH in it, or make by The JOSS is a must see.  I've bought it on iTunes and now this one for my Christmas present, so I can share it with others.  Joss has this amazing ability to be funny but still be real, and no matter how far-feched his characters, there is a ringing of truth behind it.
0812548094|5.0|This book was even better than book 1 of the series. Lots of magic, character development, and unexpected plot twists.     Down sides were there was a bit more \\"refreshing your memory\\" about book one than I think was really necessary, and some plot lines dragged on for a bit too long (enough of the mud people!!), but all in all it firmed up a plot that I will be following through the entire series.
031606792X|1.0|The beauty of Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse was the developing love, devotion and relationship between a vampire and a human.  I loved Bella's flaws all-- of them.  They made her endearing...human    I loved Edward's strength of character, maturity and his internal conflict in loving Bella.  I loved his commitment to protecting her at all cost.  I also loved the fact that he wanted Bella to live longer, to enjoy many human experiences that she would lose as a vampire.  And I loved the sacrifices and dangers each of them face each day to love each other.  It made their love and commitment special.   It's what made the series so compelling.      All the things I loved about the Twilight series were sadly lacking in BD.  I think Bella became a vampire too quickly and she lost all of the qualities that were so endearing.  I missed her clumsiness and penchant for getting into trouble.  I missed Edward's maturity and broodiness from the earlier books.   The Bella and Edward that emerged in BD were not the couple that kept me hooked on this series.      BD was just too long and too confusing at times.  The book introduced too many characters and twist and turns.  I eventually had to skim through pages just to finish the book.    BD really missed the mark with Bella and Edward.  I missed the interaction, love and growth of Bella and Edward as a couple.  There were so many plots, twists and turns that Bella and Edward's love story became secondary to everything going on.    This book was a big let down to me.
0446310786|5.0|This book captivates the mind with its wonderful adventures and adorable characters. Seeing the world through the eyes of an eight year old may sound dumb, and not a great way to spend you time. On the contrary, the memories that you had as a chold growing up emerge from a long sleep and you start to remember your adventure. Remember the haunted mansion down the street? the old man who murdered his wife? Well, this story talks about those stories, and more. It talks about matters that even most adults don't approach in the modern world. The setting is in the depths of the Great Depression, and it takes place in little Maycomb County, Alabama. The story weaves in and out of race, caste systems, and everyday life alongside fun in an \\"in-depth\\" story. This book has much more depth than when first read. Many chapters that seem random aren't that strange for they all have a meaning. I personally loved this book. I read it at school and it brought so much fun while reading it. It also brought the thrill of watching a trial through the eyes of a child. We as the readers are made to think in this book, but not so much that it's hard. Because our lives have progressed so much we see that her world is very different from ours right now. But similarities are still there. A couple of chapters in this book represent how even though something looks like it has been uprooted from our world (ex: racism), to get it to go away, you have to dig it up from it's roots. One major theme in this story is Roots and History. It even has a little tale of puppy love! (Remember those first crushes?). I realize that I make it sound bad, but that is because in class we do tend to overthink everything. That's why if you're an intellectual reader or just someone who likes books or to pass time, no matter what genre you like, this book will appeal to you. Buy this book or borrow it from a library or a friend and read it, because it will touch your heart as a great book and warm your heart as a humanbeing. The movie though... Well, that's another story.
0452284937|5.0|This book has quickly risen to my top 5 favorite books of all time. It takes a lot of brilliance and entertainment to sit alongside George Orwell, and Chevalier delivers. The 17th century Dutch landscape is described with as much depth and attention to detail as its most famous artist. The novel's protagonist and Vermeer's muse is the enigmatic girl from the painting, \\"Girl with a pearl earring\\". Chevalier masterfully blends art history and fiction to make this a delicious read. Chevalier's greatest gift lies in her ability to literally flood the reader's senses. I can still feel the thick smoothness of home-made colors between my fingers, and the warmth of the sun on my face from the windows of a solitary studio.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|It is said that Joss Whedon's favorite episode of Buffy was the musical episode.  You know the one I'm talking about, the one with the guy in street exclaiming in song \\"THEY GOT THE MUSTARD OUT!\\"    As the title says, this is Joss at his finest.  This film has it all:  action, romance, and, of course, music.  It is a testament to the low budget indy film.  Niel Patrick Harris, Nathan Fillion and Felicia Day all give stunning performances in what should be a classic.    Kudos, Joss.  You've made a gem.
B001H5X7KC|5.0|This is the single greatest movie ever made, or ever will be made.  From the guns to the decapitated heads to the explosive ending, there is zero chance that anyone who enjoys cinema would not appreciate this instant classic.  Or, should I say that if you don't enjoy this movie, please stay away from me, because life is too short to be around people that can't appreciate comedy like this.  I bought the BluRay and it's worth every penny.
B0016MJ6HY|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, definitely slower and more contemplative than some of the other genre pieces you might be tempted to compare it to, but then, that might be part of what makes it so much more meaningful.<br /><br />Each character seems to be mostly passed over by the world living with shallow and ultimately superfluous relationships while letting work or addiction wash life by them.<br /><br />As the film progresses some of the characters are abruptly thrown into situations force in meaning to their lives and slowly, inadvertently help Elizabeth, Norah Jones' character, find meaning in her own.<br /><br />The film is also very good artistically, particularly light and color of the cinematography is superb.  The performances all hold up well and I think it it may be one of both Jude Law and Natalie Portman's best.<br /><br />Great movie and far too underrated, you really should take the time to see it if you get the chance!
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I mean, what fun is a musical, if the directors and cast commentaries are not in harmony, right?
B00123MBGA|5.0|This group of recordings is probably one of the most definitive pieces<br />done by the band containing one of my all time favorites,\\"Morning Dew\\",<br />which due to unknown circunstances was dropped from their LIVE LP(GoldenGate Park recording) to which warranted much nasty response from some( me for one,many letters to Warners) and of course Good Morning Little School Girl demonstrating the bands ability to adhere to standard rocknroll as well as the intricacies of jazz and bluegrass.
B001GQACGO|2.0|I can appreciate Beyonce exploring new musical challenges, however  I just felt most all the songs fell flat to my ears.  Better luck  next time B.  You had me becoming a fan with B-DAY, but I'm skipping  you this go round.
B000Y1ZXUM|5.0|Love the concert in blu-ray, seen it 100+ times, picture is detailed and sharp, sound in LPCM multi-ch is full and clear, watched this on 55\\" plasma and 100\\" projector screen. Best concert on blu-ray I own. Shakira is a Goddess!!!!!!!! I wished it had English subtitles!
B001ILHY2C|5.0|The movie focuses on the Terminal Island Prison, which broadcast \\"Death Race\\" to the world via a popular paysite on internet. Death Race is not only a race to the finish line, but a battle pitting car against car.  Jensen Ames (Jason Statham) is framed for his wife's murder on the same day that the steel mill he works at closes; the murderer is actually a masked intruder that points a finger-gun at Ames as he leaves. Ames is sent to prison where he is coerced by the sadistic prison warden, Hennessey (Joan Allen) to become the new driver of Frankenstein's Ford Mustang. She tells Ames that she knows of his baby that was left in foster care, and that prisoners are freed upon winning five Death Races, but since he will take on the mask of the legendary Frankenstein, who had 4 wins at the time of his death, he will only need to win one race. The races are broken apart into three stages: Stage 1 and 2 are races in which the driver must survive, and Stage 3 you must win the race in order for it to add to the count towards freedom.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Again...not much more detail I can provide in a review....<br />These are the real deal and built well by Sony.<br />Amazon pricing is much better then retail...and with low shipping costs and savings on TAX...this is the place to buy em.
0596009208|1.0|Perhaps if you're a total beginner to programming and probably more so you're under 15 you'll like this book.  For me I just hate it, I know this is one of those reviews that is just the out lier to the negative but I would honestly warn people away from this book despite the copious amounts of good reviews on here.  Basically I enjoy a book that is straight to the point and condensed.  Also I enjoy a book that gives correct terminology and sticks to using it.  This book spends pages to explain basic concepts and wastes large amounts of page space on pictures and cartoons so you end up just flipping through multiples pages just searching around for the useful information.  In one night of light reading and scanning I've already moved to page 173 and every new page just annoys me more.
0440539811|3.0|'The Illuminatus Trilogy' by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson, is a cult classic of speculative fiction. 'Trilogy' implies three books and in fact the novel was originally published as three volumes to save on printing costs (cf. The Lord of the Rings) but is really one continuous story. The three parts are:'The Eye in the Pyramid', The Golden Apple' and 'Leviathan'. The novel, published in 1975 is a satire of modern conspiracy theories.   It is a difficult read as Wilson and Shea shift characters, scenes and time frames continuously, often in the same paragraph. Added to that are a multitude of characters and references to events and people that have passed out of popular consciousness over the last 25 years since the book was published (Wikipedia is your friend here). The novel is very much of its time with a definite early 70's 'counterculture' vibe. My advice is to just go with the flow and not worry too much if you can't follow the plot or remember who a specific character was, since that is not the aim of the authors. Instead the novel is a vehicle for Shea and Wilson to satirize the paranoia and conspiracy theories prevalent in the late 60's and early 70's, as well as to espouse their political and social ideas. When I chose to read ' The Illuminatus Trilogy' I was expecting a classic conspiracy thriller like 'The Da Vinci Code'. In fact this novel has been described as the grandfather of conspiracy fiction. However it becomes clear quickly that the authors don't take the Illuminatus conspiracy very seriously and in fact are pushing conspiracy theory to absurd lengths in order to make their points about modern society. Many of their ideas are interesting and the book definitely has had a deep (albeit narrow) influence on popular culture
B00005JPO1|5.0|And he's still kicking some behind like only he can!!    Personally i loved the movie and it only gets better with more viewings. I know some had some issues with the alien twist, but for me it made sense that as an archeologist, Indy would have to deal with this issue sooner or later. One only has to look at ancient civilizations to realize the tremendous impact the 'Gods' had on many of them. And those 'Gods' came from the sky... people can draw their own conclusions on this. I did find it refreshing that they just didnt make the aliens little green men from mars. They were interdimensional beings, and i loved it. I've always been fascinated by UFO's so i guess that's why i had no issues with this story for Indy.    As for the dvd itself, it has many fantastic features that touch on the different aspects of making this movie, and a brief look at the history of Indy.    Overall, i highly recommend the movie and the 2 disc version of the dvd.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I felt that I just had to add another 5-star review to help this show/movie/whatever-it-is along. I'll update this review once I get the DVD to talk about the extra features, but for now I'll simply talk about the 42 minutes of wonderfulness that is Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog.<br /><br />Update: This DVD has the best extra features I've ever seen! They are simply spectacular. The musical commentary is ridiculously funny and the songs are just as catchy as in the actual thing. I can't believe they took the time to give us another 42 minutes of excellence. It's astounding. Also, all the other extra features are cool. It's fun to learn about how they made the music and the show and everything. The creators and actors are all interesting. But one more thing puts these extra features into the upper echelon. There are hidden features! There are puzzles scattered throughout the DVD(one of the easy ones is that some credits have yellow letters that spell out an action) that, when you decipher them, tell you to perform certain actions at certain times. When you do, you get to see tidbits of bonus content. The DVD is like an extra musical and a game all in one!<br /><br />This stand-alone story tells the tale of a sort of sub-par supervillain and his attempt to enter the Evil League of Evil. The supervillain, Dr. Horrible, lives a mostly normal life when he's not being villainous. In fact, he even has a crush on a girl he always sees at the laundromat, Penny. Unfortunately, Dr. Horrible's nemesis, the just and righteous Captain Hammer also has \\"feelings\\" for Penny. And the whole thing is filled with spectacular songs! The songs are catchy and amazing, the acting is superb, the story is both hilarious and touching, and to think that all this was done during the writer's strike by a few talented people and with their own funds.<br /><br />So if you think that watching a supervillain/hero love triangle musical sounds like an amazing experience, this is for you. It's filled with parody and wit, some of the jokes are spectacular, and the entire thing is memorable. If you're like me, you'll find yourself watching this over and over, showing it to everyone you know, and reveling in the fact that you can't get the songs out of your head.<br /><br />Other things:<br /><br />1. You can watch this for free on hulu.com, but there are advertisements. I bet that if you see it there, you'll like it enough to buy the DVD.<br />2. This format is something extremely innovative and interesting. By buying this DVD and supporting Joss Whedon's new idea and format, perhaps more of these creative endeavors can come into existence. This is sort of a trial, and it's up to us to show that a short, small-budget, well-acted, well-written piece of work is worthwhile. Plus, Joss funded the entire thing himself, and I think of it as a sort of shareware. Buying this DVD is my way of saying \\"Thank you. I do in fact want to own this. Great Work.\\"<br />3. One reviewer complains that the DVD is a DVD-R, which is a little sketchy. This is only because the whole production value was in the low hundreds of thousands of dollars, perhaps not even 200k. The people behind this wonderful work are doing their best to provide us with something great, and this DVD will be just that, great, no matter the format.<br />4. Finally, I have nothing to do with Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog, other than that I am a rabid fan. My plug for the DVD is entirely based on how creative and worthwhile it is, so I hope everyone buys it and enjoys!some of the jokes are spectacular, and the entire thing is memorable.

B000092ZYX|4.0|When this album first came out, I didn't really care for it.  Maybe I just wasn't ready for Radiohead at the time.    Now, however, it's easy to see this album DOES have some very good songwriting, and not only that, but the album has a distinct sound that only Radiohead can pull off.  I don't know why I thought this album was nothing but a failed experiment back then- clearly that's not true because there's quite a lot of melodic ideas on here.      There's not many innovative bands out there today capable of creating their own sound and identity, but I believe Radiohead is a major exception.      These guys CLEARLY have their own sound, and if you happen to be in the same category as me (someone who struggles getting into new music) I believe with time (and maybe even a little bit of patience) give the songwriting a chance to grow on you, and you'll see why people are enjoying and supporting Radiohead and consider them one of the all-time greats.
B000002GB4|5.0|\\"Crystal Ball\\" would be the first Styx album without the original lineup.  John Curluiski would leave the band prior to the album's recording to be replace by guitarist, vocalist, songwriter Tommy Shaw.  For many Styx fans this is considered the classic lineup for the band and would be the group that would have by far the most commercial success.  Shaw has an excellent voice and basically gave the band 3 lead singers.  His songwriting prowess was also given free reign right from the start giving the band 3 strong songwriters as well.  In my opinion \\"Crystal Ball\\" is one of the band's best albums.  There really is not a bad song on it as Shaw, Deyoung and Young all shine here.  Deyoung had not yet slipped into sappy ballad land yet and still knew how to rock.  Shaw brought in a folk-ish element and Young gave the band a metallic edge.  The formula would go on to sell millions of records, and create a unique dichotomy within the band that made Styx sound like no one else.  Of this lineup of the band I think that \\"Crystal Ball\\" is second only to \\"The Grand Illusion\\" in terms of quality.  This one is a must own for fans.
B000001FTA|4.0|Bad Reputation is a bit of a strange album.  For one thing, people tend to ignore it, and it doesn't deserve to be ignored.  But the other thing that makes the album weird is how much of it rocks very hard, maybe even heavier than the Johnny the Fox album, and yet, the songwriting is either a LOT better than the Johnny the Fox album, or a LOT worse.  Very strange.      They weren't able to combine the heavy guitar tone with solid songwriting for this one, so you're left with the feeling the band members weren't on top of their game for this release.       To be fair, a weak Thin Lizzy song isn't necessarily bad- just forgettable, and this album has a couple of those.  This is the first Thin Lizzy album they made that has some filler IMO.    But, ignoring the filler, 70% of the album is still really good, such as the opener, with an anthem rock guitar riff taking place for the entire 5 minutes, and pretty good vocals (even though there's not a lot of vocals on this track, for some reason- guess the band members wanted to jam a bit).    The title song also cooks.  Love that mean sounding chorus and convincing lyrics.   What a great lead singer this band had.      \\"Opium Trial\\" is a song I really don't care for.  The vocals do nothing for me, and there's nothing appealing about this track.  I'm a bit surprised by this.  \\"Dancing in the Moonlight\\" is groovy and AWESOME!  I love that chorus and the entire atmosphere of this song.  Thin Lizzy was experimenting here, and it works great.    \\"Killer Without a Cause\\" has a great guitar riff and more enjoyable vocals.  A great song.  \\"Downtown Sundown\\" kind of smells funny, haha.  I don't really like the way the verse melody is sung, for whatever reason.    But, the album gets better again with \\"That Woman's Gonna Break Your Heart\\", which has a mighty fine chorus.      Overall, yeah, Thin Lizzy must have been going through a dry spell with this one.
B0006AAS5G|4.0|Ok, now a Rolex is a Rolex. So if you want one you gonna have'ta come up with the cash. If you want to have people think that you own one, then this is the one you want. As for the watch I have to agree with most of the reviews that it looks much better than the picture, and it is heavy. The Chronograph though does not work. I tried it so many times but I never got it to adjust like the manual says. I do have to agree with the reviews before me too about if looks matters with you, then this is it, because the Cronos are worthless. I can't give it a 5 star because it is not fully functional like it claimed, but I just can't get my self to drop it to a 3 star cause it sure feels like a Dytona ;)
0956010903|4.0|It met all my expectations for this wonderful author. My only complaint is that soon after I started reading, and really started getting into it, I turned the page and found only the back cover.  It was far too short and leaves one hoping for another installment in the HP series.  I can only hope this was the author's intent.
0956010903|5.0|If you're a Harry Potter fan and a bibliophile, get this while you can.  I just finished reading the first tale, and assuming the rest are like the first, it's worth the read.  Plus, the binding is well executed in leather for the book and faux-leather (but still tasteful) for the slipcase.  Worth the money.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I gave birth just slightly over 8 weeks ago and was anxious to get back into my pre-pregnancy clothes so that I didn't have to buy anything for the winter season (I'm in Arizona, so I can hold out for a long time). I'm breastfeeding and in spite of watching what I eat, I have not and cannot decrease my calorie intake all that much. Consequently, dieting alone is not the answer for me.  So I bought this video along with a couple of the biggest loser videos. I started out with the biggest loser videos for about 1 week, but it was Jillian's Shred video that really got me sweating. I've done the workout for 14 days, only taking 2 days off in that time. This workout, as many others have commented, is intense. The order of the exercises can really work certain muscle groups to exhaustion.  The 3-2-1 concept is brilliant and Jillian's compound exercises, working more than one muscle group per exercise, really gives you a full workout. I've worked out for years and frankly nothing has made me sweat like this video. My husband, who is also extremely fit and been put through intense workouts as a result of his profession, has commented that he has never sweat like this before and that he never, ever expected such an amazing workout from a dvd.  And while I haven't lost a single pound (and don't really expect to until I stop breastfeeding -- breastfeeding has not resulted in weight loss for me as it does for many moms)I am feeing much more toned all over. My lower abs are perhaps my weakest muscle and so when doing the ab exercises I do a bit of a modification so as not to strain the muscle. But other than that, everything else is completely within my capability. I don't think it is a video for someone completely new to exercise as it is really tough. Today I tried on my pre-pregnancy jeans and a pair of dress pants, and was able to get them on -- they are very tight, but I imagine after another 2 weeks of doing Jillian's workout I will be able to wear them comfortably. Thankyou Jillian -- you are one tough cookie, but completely amazing!!!!
0618918248|4.0|I've just finished this book (audio book version) and must say its one of the most thorough dismantlings of belief in god I have read. It might come across as too \\"scientific\\" and complicated for those ignorant of logical principles or short on common sense but then again, this is largely why people believe in fantasies like gods to begin with.    Dawkins again shows us that the rudiments of rational thinking and deductive logic bring us to the inevitable conclusion (if we are intellectually honest with ourselves) that god simply cannot exist. It also highlights the absurdity of contemporary, mainstream Christianity. Furthermore we are shown that belief systems arise as much through Darwinian natural selection as through cultural evolution.    Highly recommended for spiritual fence-sitters and hardcore religionists alike who are not afraid to listen to a voice of reason.
B000025H0Q|5.0|I first  listened to this album some 25 years ago in college.  As I said in the title it was great then and its still great now.
0061537934|5.0|Wow!<br /><br />This is not the genre that I usually read.  This book was very moving and I could not put it down.  I really did laugh and cry.  I have given my copy to 3 others who raved about it and bought 5 other copies as gifts.<br /><br />I emailed Mr. Stein and he was very appreciative.  He even mailed me a book plate to put in the front of the book.<br /><br />It is nice to have such a talented author take the time to respond to his fans.
B000Q6GUTI|1.0|I almost didn't write a review for this film since there are already plenty of bad reviews here.  I have a major gripe with Hollywood these days.  Movies like Shooter are happening all too frequently.  This movie could have been good, but it is not.  How did they get Mark Wahlberg, Danny Glover, and Ned Beatty to make this movie?  Ok, Glover and Beatty are probably just happy to be working, but that doesn't excuse Wahlberg.      This movie makes Rambo look realistic.  If you are able to throw out reason, don't particularly care about a plot or story line, and enjoy watching a one man army, you might enjoy this movie.  The government \\"bad guys\\" (Glover and Beatty) are so over the top it's nearly comical.  Actually it's rather sad to see real talent wasted like this.  How does a movie like this even get made?  There is no difference between Shooter and some straight to video low budget shoot-em-up staring no-names.  If only the movie would have been scaled back and feature realistic dialog and situations, it might have been interesting.  Unless Amazon sells this movie for $1, it isn't worth the price.
B0007P0LO8|4.0|This isn't a full review but a response to the other reviews here - I read all of them. The singing is excellent and listening to it with the video turned off is not a bad idea as some have suggested. The visuals are not uniformly bad. There are bad moments - I agree with those others have noted. Few have noted the good moments - there are some! One example is the morning scene after Butterfly has waited all night for Pinkerton to return. It is a lovely movie moment. There are lots of moments that are perfectly fine - like the flower scene in the garden - not great movie-making, but perfectly fine. Most of the scenes in the movie fall into the \\"more or less good\\" category. Of course it is the embarrassingly bad (or just puzzling) ones that stick in the mind of most reviewers here. If you watch this movie, bring a big helping of forgiveness for the visuals and you'll enjoy it. If something offends you, close your eyes and enjoy the singing!
B001E1DPWE|4.0|This book is based on an affair Frank Lloyd Wright conducted with a married woman, Mamah Borthwick Cheney, whose home he designed. Some surprises here. Mamah was an early feminist, a translator of the works of Swedish author Ellen Key. Both were highly motivated, interesting people, but having an affair in the early 20th century was scandalous, and led to loss of commissions for Wright, and harassment by newspaper reporters who wanted to get scoops. Well-written, gripping story, with a surprise ending.
B001KZVQJI|5.0|First of all,slamming a bluray release and giving out false facts about the movie make's the reviewer look stupid!! The true is the bluray release will feature the original version that was seen in the theatres and the extended cut on one disc and DTS HD Master Audio soundtrack to boot. This release will be fully loaded with special features at $20-$25 price tag!!! You can't beat that at all.
0316035904|4.0|Mr. Sedaris little book of Christmas jeer is perfect for anyone with a quirky, sarcastic sense of humor. This is not a heart-warming compilation, but still a very funny perspective on the less holy aspects of this popular season. It would be quite the stretch in saying that some of these stories are applicable to Christmas. Mr. Sedaris also takes tangential potshots at Easter and Halloween. Though his piece about observing pathologists working in a morgue is entertaining, I failed to see its relation to any holiday theme. A quick, silly, caustic and enlightening read. But please be warned, this book will not fill you with the stereotypical holiday spirit unless you just so happen to be Ebenezer Scrooge before the ghostly visits.
0743298039|5.0|Every once in a while, I'll read a book that raises the bar for me and inspires me to want to be a better writer, either because of the prose or the premise.  Books that come to mind are Mark Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, Robert Cormier's Fade, Bill Bryson's A Walk in the Woods, Paolo Coelho's The Alchemist, Jodi Picoult's Second Glance, and now, Diane Setterfield's The Thirteenth Tale.    This contemporary gothic novel alternates narrators between the reliable Margaret Lea and the unreliable Vida Winter.  As Vida, a novelist at the end of her life, tells the story of her life to Margaret, a biographer, the reader is led on a series of twists and turns through a gravyard, the shell of a burned-out mansion and a childhood peopled with cooks, gardeners and other staff at the Angelfield manor.    Even more haunting is the audio version of the book, narrated by Bianca Amato as Margaret and Jill Tanner as Vida.  It's the perfect book to transport you to a completely different time and place.  Best read on a rainy afternoon with a cup of tea.

0956010903|5.0|This book is beautiful and captures the look of the original. I ordered two copies and I am so glad I did now. It's much better than I expected! Rowling's artwork is magnificent, and the bonus prints are great quality. I think I may indeed frame some of them! Thanks to Jo Rowling and Amazon for giving us fans this amazing opportunity to own this special replica of Jo's amazing tales, and for allowing this charity to benefit so greatly from the proceeds!
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I know....he won \\"American Idol\\". But, let me assure you, he's NOT a Taylor Hicks. David Cook was the real deal before anyone discovered that he could rearrange other people's songs and turn them from gold to platinum and before even HE knew he could stare through the camera at the ladies with those soulful eyes and make them vote steadily on 4 phones for 4 hours. Winning Idol didn't legitimate his talent, it only propelled it into our living rooms and we shot it out into the world. This CD is the end product of all our voting and, let me tell you, it was worth all the elevated phone bills and falling asleep at work the next day. His brilliant lyrics (10 of the 12 songs were either co-written by him or penned on his own) are only the beginning of this CD's appeal. His soaring, sometimes gritty, sometimes breathy voice lifts you up with it or cuts into your soul to help you feel his pain. If you've heard his first solo CD, Analog Heart (and I suggest you find it and download it!) you'll know that this post-Idol CD is just the beginning of an incredible career. Okay, so you say you don't particularly like \\"Light On\\". Like I said in the title of this review, don't be so quick to judge. Just buy the thing and hear the rest of it. If you don't love it, you're nuts.
B0002KPIKA|4.0|As soon as she hears that her new husband Emperor Claudio is dead, Agrippina decides put her son Nero on the throne even though he has no claim.  Her plans are disrupted by the return of the Emperor but that does not stop Agrippina's scheming, oh no...The opera libretto is set in classical Rome, but the writer Grimani is really satirizing the Rome and particularly the Pope of his own time.  Handel took this racy tale and wrote spicy music that seems to underline the foibles of the characters.<br /><br />This production brings together a juicy female title role with a splendid singer who is well up to the joint demands of singing Handel's wicked music and acting evil. Veronique Gens sings and schemes as AGRIPPINA and the results are wonderful.  The splendid young countertenor, Phillippe Jaroussky plays her son, Nero.  Nigel Smith is wonderfully comic as the easily manipulated Emperor of Rome, Claudio.  Ingrid Perruche is totally believable as the beautiful Poppea.  My one quibble with the casting is Thierry Gregoire as Ottone--he sang as if the ridiculous crotch-high boots that were part of his costume were affecting his voicebox.<br /><br />The director seemed to be afraid that the viewer could not tell that this opera is intended to be a farce--all those scenes with all those men running in and out of Poppea's bedroom were not clue enough. Every character is given a costume that tends to the exaggerated if not the grotesque.  Ottone is supposed to be the romantic hero: hence the thigh-high boots.  Nero's costume is half-clown, half little-boy-sailor suit.  Poppea is dressed in frothy layers of spring green and pink, while Claudio stumbles around in his nightgown--which looks almost dignified next to the others!  Aprippina wears devil-red with wide panniers...it all works, but I'm not sure if it is \\"because of\\" or \\"in spite of\\".  This opera is like one of those little cakes with the colorful frosting outside and layers of cream, jam and cake inside: yummy but not to be taken too seriously.riously.
B001F2W4Y2|3.0|Overall this album is better than Stiff Upper Lip.  But it's nothing to get too excited about, especially since it took them EIGHT YEARS to do this.  All the songs are above average but not great.  Nothing stands out.  Brian's voice is too low and too relaxed.  This could have been great if the songs had a little more kick to them.    This sounds like a really good AC/DC tribute band.    They desperately need Mutt Lange back for the next album.
B000HA4WT8|4.0|Please allow me to put in my two cents as an Army brat who went to school in Japan from nursery school all the way to grade 12.  Not once did I wear a school uniform or have a Japanese-speaking instructor.  Nor did we ever wear uwabaki, for that matter.  Military dependents go to American school which look pretty much like stateside schools.  Why would they ever put an American in a Japanese classroom when it would only create a distraction and slow things down?  Movies rarely reflect reality.

B0000C1733|4.0|Well, in reading some reviews it would appear that their are some people who have allowed themselves to be quite personally affronted by this release. I for one recognise that a greatest hits release is rarely the artist's idea, and is often the label's idea, hence the songs you get are rarely a reflection of what the band themselves would choose or consider to be their best work.  If you own all of the peppers' work, why would you bother to buy a CD that has all songs on it that you already own? Also, why would you then crap all over the CD, just because it didn't have other songs which you already own on it?  This CD is not a comprehensive discography of the peppers at their best. It is, however, quite a good CD to throw on to get a chili fix, and you don't have to wade through the agro of other CD's to get to the good stuff.  If I were to describe this CD, I would say it's a mellow collection of some of their more accesible music. Their are no bad songs on here, and sure, many more could have been put onto the disc, but at the end of the day, I read the back of the cover and thought to myself, 'I like these songs. I'm going to buy this CD.' To those who looked at the back of the CD and thought, 'This sucks!' and then went ahead and brought it anyway and then felt the need to give it a bad and at times ignorant reveiew, well, they saw you coming! If you don't like it, don't buy it. You can tell, because the songs are right their on the cover. There are no surprises.   I personally find this CD to be a good collection of songs by the peppers. When I want to hear a different collection of songs by the peppers, I put a different peppers CD on.

0375424474|5.0|Neil Shubin, an evolutionary biologist who works as Provost of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, clearly chose the right career. In Your Inner Fish: A Journey into the 3.5 Billion-Year History of the Human Body, Shubin traces the history of our anatomy with a passion that leaps off the page. His conversational writing style, coupled with animated anecdotes and crisp descriptions, energized my reading so that two hundred pages seemed more like twenty.    The title of the book, Your Inner Fish, refers to the evolutionary history we humans share with other animals. Shubin, who also acts as Professor of Anatomy and Associate Dean at the University of Chicago, opens with the tale of how he co-discovered Tiktaalik roseae, sometimes called the \\"fish that crawled out of the water,\\" in the Canadian Arctic in 2006. This groundbreaking find provides compelling evidence of an intermediate stage between fish and early limbed animals, and serves as an illustration of the \\"history of life within us,\\" one example among many that Shubin highlights.    Of course, Charles Darwin predicted that transitional forms would illustrate a gradual evolutionary shift between two distinct groups, and Tiktaalik fits the bill. Like most fish, Tiktaalik possessed gills, scales, and webbed fins. Yet, it also sported innovations like wrists, lungs, and a mobile neck, and it denotes the earliest creature to possess all the bones of our arm, wrist, and palm. Previous to Tiktaalik, fish did not exhibit these joints. Thus, this creature laid the stepping-stones for later vertebrates to transition onto dry land.    The author tells us why we should care about this: \\"Virtually every illness we suffer has some historical component. ... [D]ifferent branches of the tree of life inside us - from ancient humans, to amphibians and fish, and finally to microbes - come back to pester us today ... show[ing] that we were not designed rationally, but are products of a convoluted history.\\"    He pinpoints the evolutionary history of our senses of smell, sight, and hearing, as well as that of our wrists, teeth, jaws, and skull, and he explains such common ailments as hiccups, hernias, and sleep apnea.    In a poignant passage about dissecting the human hand, Shubin recalls his personal introduction as a student to human anatomy. After spending months dissecting internal organs, he felt detached about the task before him. Seeing the hand jolted him back to reality: \\"[s]uddenly this mechanical exercise, dissection, became deeply and emotionally personal.\\" Similarly, when he examined Tiktaalik's modified fin for the first time, he felt that he had \\"uncovered a deep connection between my humanity and [that of] another being,\\" which is the whole premise of his book.    Your Inner Fish provides a fascinating overview of the history of our own evolution, an introduction that is both readable and inviting. I suppose the simple explanations and introductory tone Shubin uses might give more well-read students seeking in-depth analysis or discussion, reason to criticize, but for a non-scientist reader such as myself, Shubin strikes the right note for piquing my interest further. And simply by asking what evolution from our animal ancestors really means for us, Shubin makes the book personally relevant in a modern context.    Shubin concludes with an inspiring message: \\"I can imagine few things more beautiful or intellectually profound than finding the basis for our humanity, and remedies for many of the ills we suffer, nestled inside some of the most humble creatures that ever lived on our planet.\\"    Roxanne Enman
B000VWSI8S|5.0|This version of In a Sentimental Mood is incredible. Just pure, heartbreaking beauty.  The drummer goes to kind of a weird Time Out kind of place, but he comes back and ends it nicely.  The best dollar you will ever spend.    Brown Book is also great.  Coltrane sounds like Johnny Hodges, Duke's regular sax player, and that's a GOOD thing.    On the other tunes, Duke is exquisite on piano, the bass and drums are nice, but ... Coltrane is melodic and perfect for 30 or 60 seconds and then he goes off to his atonal genius place where I cannot follow or listen.
0345444051|4.0|Though Clarke is known mostly for writing \\"hard\\" science fiction, this book is a surprising departure from his usual style.  The very technical descriptions that abound in 2001 are absent here, allowing for an easier and more enjoyable reading.  It begins with a premise used in countless books and movies since then: aliens finally approach Earth, and human beings don't know what to expect.  But this isn't your typically \\"humans revolt against evil aliens\\" story.  This tale is about mankind's evolution to the next level of consciousness as the Overlord aliens guide humanity along this path.  This process takes place over the course of many decades, so there's very little character development; most characters only make appearances in short chunks.  In spite of this, the story moves well through the first 100 pages, providing the answers to many mysteries that arise along the way.  However, I found the second half of the book a little disappointing since it provides very few answers to any lingering questions.  The lack of any explanation as to why humanity suddenly evolves seemed like too much of a cop-out to me.  It's easy to say that we can never understand why this happened; it's much harder to provide a rational explanation.  Still, compared to some of Clarke's other books, this book was much more enjoyable and reader friendly.  Just be ready for an open-ended conclusion.
0060723513|5.0|A great story.  A fascinating journey.  The wisdom the indigenous ones have is amazing!
B001H5X7JS|4.0|Tropic Thunder is a guilty pleasure - much along the lines of Zoolander in that it's packed with witticisms and caricatures that take a few viewings to go from very funny to absolutely hilarious. My wife hated this film by the way, and it's definitely not for everyone - but if you have a sense of humor, you'll like it.<br /><br />Rather than re-hash the plot, I'd like to quote my favorite parts without giving anything away:<br /><br />- Tom Cruise as the Producer (Les Grossman) is in his best role ever. Forget Born on the Fourth of July or any of that serious stuff, this is pure gold. Basically, none of the quotes are clean enough for Amazon, but there's a good summary on IMDB here [...]. Essentially one of the best dialog roles since Lee Ermey in Full Metal Jacket.<br /><br />- The entire subplot about actors who depict mentally challenged characters in order to get Oscars is pure genius. It's a shame this was seen as offensive since the fun is being poked (savagely) at Hollywood rather than people with disabilities. The Simple Jack character is a masterful blend of Rain Man, Forrest Gump and I Am Sam.<br /><br />- Robert Downney Jr's scenes are all downright hilarious (the \\"you people\\" scene was great). He's one of the most talented actors around these days, and it's uncanny how he can play Russell Crowe playing \\"Kirk Lazarus\\".<br /><br />Needless to say, this is one for the DVD collection. There's a saggy 20 minutes towards the end that slows the pace a little but otherwise it's pretty much non-stop laughs all the way.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I know there are plenty of reviews out there about Band of Brothers but I have never written any so I decided to give it a shot here.  1st off let me say I watched the original dvd version a few years ago and I was blown away by how the series was put together I didn't care about picture quality or sound.  Though picture and sound are nice it takes a back seat to what the series is all about.  So here is about the blu ray since the day I found out it was coming out for blu ray I knew I had to absolutely get this one.  One thing I did notice that someone who isn't a HD person odds are wont care about the amazing picture quality nor appreciate it.  Some people I know can look at it and really not tell a difference simply b/c they don't have the eye for HD or HD doesn't interest them.  I think pretty much everybody should see this series whether HD or not fan of war flicks or not.  The case is pretty much the same as the original and so is the inside of the case.  I didn't have a copy of the original to compare to but as far as I remember they are basically the same packaging even though this one I think is just a little smaller.<br /><br />Sticking the movies in at 1st is kind of annoying though it doesn't take long you have to sit through the warnings and HBO screen.  After that I had my 1st look at the blu ray version and I must say I am amazed by the quality such as richer blacks and color detail or even blades of grass.  Though the film grain still exists I am pretty sure its intentional since it's usually in battle scenes but I rather like film grain in this type of film.  I enjoy the grittiness and the shakiness of the camera that just add to the chaos of whats being shown.  I think that is what pulled me into Saving Private Ryan is just the overall rawness and chaos that was in WWII and the sense of realism with how the films were shot camera wise like (I think its called documentary style).<br /><br />The audio in this version is phenomenal and the sounds are just amazing even though the dvd version had good audio this one really shines like when you hear a Thompson, Garand, or an MG firing.  I guess its more about clarity and more dynamic when you have your surround sound cranked you can really have sound that jumps out and makes you say wow which most blu rays specialize at.  It made me really appreciate the sense of realism that was put into this series like hearing outdoor ambience or distant gunfire or how everything just has a distinct sound that you like to hear over and over.<br /><br />For some odd reason I kept listening to one part where there was a Carbine being shot by someone I can't remember but I think is in the episode about Carnetan.  One of my favorite parts in this regard is probably when they are about to jump in Disc 1 Ep. 2 and AA guns firing everywhere and planes getting holes shot in them and everything is just chaotic inside the planes as well as the outside.  So many parts from the series stick out in this regard like hearing the mortar strikes in Bastogne its just so much in each episode it would take a long time to write about it.<br /><br />I understand the realistic nature of whats being portrayed and all I am doing is pointing out how great the series is put together blu ray wise and not trying to sound like I am indulging in the violence.  I believe there is a great seriousness and respect that needs to be shown in regards to what is going on.<br /><br />Though the movie has actors the violence was real for the men of Easy Company as with everyone else in WWII.  What really makes this series hit such emotional peak with me is the openings and the extras that are from the actual men of Easy Company and not actors.  When I hear them speak of what they saw and what they felt I would have to say Band of Brothers was the series that finally got me to think and reflect on WWII.<br /><br />I know some people will watch it as just entertainment but it is so much more than that.  The extra like WeStand Alone Together which is a documentary that just amazes me to hear coming from the real people and it really pulled at my emotions.  I think the ending of the documentary is one of the greatest things I have ever seen or heard that brought me to tears when Winters shows his humility and talks about his grandchild asking him if he was a hero and I am sure most fans know what I am talking about.  To me those words resonate with me when I think about WWII.  Do yourself a favor and don't skip that documentary.  I think it would be great to have watched that before seeing the movie but no big deal.<br /><br />Since seeing the series for the 1st time a few years ago my respect grew greatly for \\"The Greatest Generation\\".  Blu ray or not this is far by one the greatest series ever and I found myself wishing there were more episodes since there is just so much about these men to tell indeed it was \\"The Greatest Generation\\".umentary that just amazes me to hear coming from the real people and it really pulled at my emotions.

1573229725|5.0|The beginning of this novel starts out dark, very dark when talking about Sue Trinders past. Sue lives with a bunch of thieves and witnesses illegal activity every day of her life. When presented with an opportunity to scam a woman with a lot of money, she doesn't give up on the idea but considers it completely before finally accepting.<br /><br />When she arrives she's not sure what to make of the place and is not sure that her new mistress will be convinced that she really is a maid. Eventually she falls into step with her maid duties and really becomes comfortable in the role of helping her longtime male friend scam this woman to ultimately get her put away forever and to get her share of the fortune.<br /><br />However, things do not go as planned. Both women decieve each other, and in the end, her mistress is scammed as well. Sue and Maud both discover they have very deep feelings for each other and when Sue can stand it no longer, she finds her way back to Sue.<br /><br />All in all, I found this a wonderful read with many plot twists that will make it hard to put this book down. The only thing that upsets me about this book is that we don't get to really experience the depth of love that both women feel for each other. I wish we'd experiece it more instead of just in fleeting glances before the book ends.<br /><br />If you're planning on buying this, make sure you start reading when you have nothing left to do because you will not get any work done!
B001KO3FFW|5.0|This is a terrific album. It has powerhouse rock titles (Bar-ba-Sol, Mr Sensitive) and one of the most delicate and raw inspirational songs every written in my opinion (Permanent). Each of the songs has a strong story-like feel and listening to them gives me great mental images of personal and universal truths. Do yourself a favor and buy two of these albums...so when you burn the first one out from repeated play, you have a spare!

The cover looks great, the drawings are nice, the stories aren't all that \\"magical\\" and the sections that are supposed to be the notes of Dumbledore are wordy and boring. I am glad I spotted it at the library and checked it out instead of actually buying my own copy.
0956010903|5.0|Amazing! As I went through the layers of packaging, starting with the cardboard box, I could hardly contain my excitment! The presentation far exceeded my expectations. Then to reach the tome itself, well, you are holding a beautifully executed reproduction of a book that sold for $398,000,000! Any one with less of an opinion cannot be a true book lover nor can appreciate what went into producing this amazing piece.  Thank you Amazon!
0956010903|5.0|A short while ago I opened my door to find a large package from Amazon:  I could not believe it was actually my copy of The Collectors Edition of the Tales of Beedle the Bard!  While I first ordered this a while ago, there was a problem with my credit card and I had to reorder, so I did not think I would get this book at all, much less on the relealse date!  Thank you Amazon, I don't know how you do it!    The book is an absolutely must have for every Harry Potter fan.  I had already read the tales themselves when I opened this volume, and they are truly delightful and full of wonderful messages for our children (and for all the magic lovers among us).  The stories aside, this edition is truly beautiful and a pleasure to hold in one's hand.  There are some wonderful and unique features to it -- the set of reprints is just beautiful;  the small book inside the velvet bag inside the larger volume makes you feel like you are opening a treasure and indeed you are!    I bought this volume for my son for a Christmas present, but now I'm thinking, maybe I will need another one!  It is well worth the money to own such a special item, and it makes it that much greater that a portion of the proceeds goes to Ms. Rowling's incredible charity.  I know the holidays are going to be very special in my house.  Thank you Ms. Rowling, for yet another gift to your legions of fans.

0545128285|5.0|Everything written with the pen of JK Rowling seems to be magical, and this volume is no exception.  The very genesis of this book is so special:  the tales in it, we are told, were left to Hogwarts by the great Professor Dumbledore.   The style and sentiment of these five little fables will come as no surprise to anyone who is a Harry Potter fan --  in fact one of them should already be well known to all.  \\"The Tale of the Three Brothers\\" was first told in Book 7 of the Harry Potter series.  It is such a simple yet strong tale with such a forceful message (much like all of JK Rowling's tales) of the difficulty of making hard choices and  being the master of one's own fate.  I have read this fable to my sons who are still pondering its message.     No one less than Hermione Granger serves as the translator of these works, and Ms. Rowling has included with the text Dumbledore's commentary and some wonderful illustrations of her own.  The simplicity of the tales only underscores the wonderful messages they bear in terms that are not at all preachy.  In many ways, the stories remind me of many standard fairy tales, such as those written by Aesop or the Brothers Grimm, but in a context much more likely to appeal to young children as well as the magic lovers among us.  It has always amazed me that anyone could find anything in Rowling's work that is somehow not wholesome.  Her messages as always are clear, simple, direct and as important life lessons as children will ever learn:  the use and abuse of power;  the benefit of working together; being able to recognize and value what is special in each of us;  the dangers of working with the dark arts (i.e., the abuse of power).  It is no wonder that her work is so loved and so enduring.   I will treasure this volume as I have treasured all of the Harry Potter books.  Only one of the fables is a bit too dark for me (The Warlock's Hairy Heart);  I'm not sure I will read it to my kids as it is a bit gruesome.     I have not yetreceived the Collector's Edition that I pre-ordered.  I know that there is much speculation that this edition may have been over-subscribed.  My order information indicates that I should receive it December 8th.  I certainly hope I do, but if not, I notice that it is already for sale on ebay, and most sellers are not seeking to gouge people too badly.   The real disappointment in ordering it on ebay would be losing out on the chance to make a contribution to Ms. Rowling's wonderful charity, The Children's Voice Campaign.  But I think I might just make a separate contribution, as a small return for the many wonderful hours of reading and reflection she has given me!
B001LM1456|4.0|Here is my rhyming homage' to the newest \\"Incredible Hulk\\", to the tune of Blondie's \\"Call Me\\"<br /><br />Bruce Banner is the subject of a movie once again<br />But this time it is different (watching will not cause you pain)<br />Marvel gets it right this time<br />The Hulkster says his \\"HULK SMASH!\\"  line!<br />This Hulk! -Movie's fine,<br />It's great if you're the comics kind.<br />This Hulk!- Movie's fine<br />It's much better than my silly rhyme,<br />This Hulk!<br /><br />So...<br />Honestly, I didn't expect to enjoy this movie much, but I did! Ed Norton is perfect as Bruce Banner, the CG's are great, Liv Tyler is still a beauty to behold, and William Hurt is a very hate worthy villain. I watched the Video On Demand rental over Thanksgiving and watched \\"Iron Man\\" right afterwards and was happy to see that I should do exactly that, as they are tied together. There is a kind touch for the old TV show fans by showing Bill Bixby on TV (The courtship of Eddy's Father) and Lou Ferigno plays a guard at the University. If you don't hate \\"Super Hero\\" movies you should like this fun movie as well.<br /><br />3 1/2*
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I like the song for $0.89 cents. It is cheaper than iTunes.    Your review by:    Pink Ipod dude. and I am proud.( I have a Black Case!!!)
B001GQSY5U|5.0|Some don't like this - we loved it (hubby and I). We're long time Star Wars geeks, and here, they finally get the stories right, interesting concepts, some fun, some action. It's a movie that is really just a set of battles in a war, and it's exactly what it should be - that is what the Clone Wars are. But what I really love is the new animation concept - computerized, but with hand drawn textures of all kinds, clouds in the backgrounds, the texture of skin, everything. This gives a very unique appearance to the movie. It's great fun, as is the entire series.

B00188M5TM|5.0|I am so tired of reviewers who insist that their writting is so important that they have to write a review that is a book long.<br /><br />Dang good movie.  True story that is amazing.  Go see it.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Where are the bloopers????    In spite of a lot of negativity towards Catherine Tate (I didn't like her, or more the characters she played), I loved Donna. She is truly an equal to the Doctor, unlike Rose and Martha. I think it would have been kinder to have her live with the Doctor's memories and die than to have her memories wiped, but that's just me (ethical dilemma, anyone?). Either way, I cry every time I watch the final episode because of it. I suppose leaving the second Doctor with Rose made sense, but it still feels like taking the easy way out. Well, what do you do with a replica of yourself, eh?
1595141979|5.0|I couldn't wait to get into the third book of the series after reading the first two back to back a few months ago.  I was not dissapointed. This one is just as good as the others if not better.  I was afraid the series would end with this one.  I am glad there will be another one and I am just as excited to read the next book as I was all the others.  I have to wait almost another year though?!
B000WC8R0G|5.0|Hopefully this is the original Ghost in the Shell or someone is trying to con you.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This is the classic superhero story twisted upside down and turned into a musical. As strange as that sounds you would think Dr Horrible would be bound for the grave, yet within 5 minutes of watching, I was hooked.     A behind the scenes look of life from a want-to-be-supervillian, this story gives you a natural feel.  Dr Horrible's (Neil Patrick Harris) video blogs helps set the tone.  His clumsy behavior makes him realistic and believable and not so evil. While Captain Hammer's (Nathan Fillion) ego reinforces that life is more than just black and white. Felicia Day is the lovely Penny who inspires Dr Horrible, and inspires Captain Hammer with another way to dig at Dr Horrible.    The songs are addictive, and extremely easy to get into your head. Suddenly you will find yourself singing a song from it and laughing.  All in all, a rather twisted addictive tale by Joss Whedon

B00005JN8Z|5.0|A beautiful print of this good film. The film is not quite as good as the original book though. But decent, considering that Mervyn Leroy was behind the wheel of this super-production, so it could hardly fail. The best is the crisp and beautiful cinematography, the real sets, the colors, the whole spectacle of it. The weakest is the shortage of running time: the story has been shortened way to much from the original. There is no time for transitions, no character development. The heroine meets the hero and in no time he's become a Christian and they are married. It makes no sense. For the story to work properly it should have had, at least, one more hour only for character development; and then more for lots of facts that matter and are not even told in the film. For instance: the Greek character who is paid to go and pass as a Christians to later on betray them to the Romans. There's a lot of stuff that goes untold in the film. Therefore the film is just a great spectacle, but no more. Saved by the sheer audacity of a good director.<br /><br />Oh, what it could have been with more time, and more money!
0201626632|3.0|I found this book to be a great introductory text to prepare you for more reading on books related to scientific mentoring.  The matter-of-fact and casual tone used in the book sound more like a mentor speaking to you than a published text.<br /><br />Pros:<br />--Very short (109 pages)<br />--Easy reading (casual tone)<br />--Straight talk.  A lot of the book is obvious, but it's nice to hear it from someone in the field of science.<br /><br />Cons:<br />--Very short (109 pages)<br />--Outdated (published in 1993)  Needs a new version with updated information.  No mention of the internet.  Mentions using overhead slides in a talk (really, who does that at a professional meeting in current times?)<br /><br />Unless they update this book, I would hold off on buying it.  See if you can get it at your school library.  It's worth reading, but not buying.

0743289692|5.0|Ayaan Hirsi Ali's story is not a novel, even though we find the lives she describes to be unimaginable in the 21st century.  We in the West need to read this shocking book to help us understand the intense devotion of millions of people to beliefs that are militantly hostile to our Western world view. This is the most courageous woman I have ever met.
0316743305|5.0|Had to buy this book for a Master's class on executive decision making in the aerospace industry.  Fascinating insights.  Highly recommend.
0316172324|5.0|From what I have read of negative reviews here- most people who don't like the book don't like it because they disagree with it.  The idea itself is quite controversial, and I'm not sure I fully agree with Gladwell, but the manner in which he presents it is entertaining and enjoyable to read.  His anecdotes do show some examples where \\"thin slicing\\" can come quite in handy, but he doesn't say this should overrule thought out processes- his point is that sometimes we can \\"thin slice\\" and be right, when overanalyzing leads to the wrong conclusion.  The book is very well written and great for anyone who likes to have something to talk about.  I also recommend this book to anyone who likes the book \\"Freakonomics\\" because Gladwell uses a similar anecdotal writing stye to Levitt and Dubner.  You shouldn't let your doubts keep you from reading this book- you don't have to agree with Gladwell just because you read it.  It's fun read even if you disagree.
B001G9LVGG|5.0|I will not say much as I love Loreena McKennitt's music. The song \\"Emmanuel\\" alone makes this well worth the price. What beautiful music.  Bravo on another great composition.
159448385X|5.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns is a fascinating history of recent events in Afghanistan, and also a great personal story of family dynamics and the difficulties facing women and girls in this war-torn country.  Hosseini's writing style is elegant, and the story itself is gripping and emotional.  It's both an education about Afghanistan's recent history and a great read.  Highly recommended.

B000002KHB|2.0|The liner notes on this album say something like '2 out of 3 music critics agree: Heavy Metal was born in 1972 with the release of 'Machine Head'.  I totally disagree with this.  I would have to say it was born in 1970 with the release of Deep Purple's 'In Rock'.  'In Rock' melted ears, and probably scared a lot of people to death.  Ian Gillan's animal-like screams, Ritchie's explosive guitar chords, Lord's psychedelic organ,  and the ground-pounding rhythm section of Ian Pace and Glover became a force to be reckoned with.  Songs ranged anywhere  between 3 and 8 minutes long and were jam-packed with long mesmerizing guitar solos and siren-throated screams.      Machine Head, in my opinion, was a cold, dry and over-calculated affair; It was recorded in a hotel lobby and it definitely shows.  Ian's powerful shrieks are almost nowhere to be found in this album - perhaps once in 'Highway Star' and 'Lazy' and twice in 'Space Truckin'  Ritchie's manic, spontaneous, fuzzed out guitar tone is replaced with a consistently drab, clean yet somewhat distorted, Fender rock-a-billy tone.  And Jon Lord is just too... loungey on this record.  With 'In Rock' his playing was just as crazy as the guitar pyrotechnics (sample 'Livin' Wreck').  On 'Machine Head', his playing passes for some good backdrop music for a dude in a 70s leisure suit holding a martini trying to pick up chicks (sample the keyboard solo in 'Never Before')      I'm sure a lot of people think this record is a wondrous classic - since a few of it's songs get a lot airplay (including the long yawner 'LAZY') but that's just it - it's tame enough to get airplay.  Nothing on 'In Rock' gets airplay and that's because it's still too lethal for weak, untrained ears -  38 years after the fact.    I would even prefer to give the progressive leanings of 'Fireball' a spin before listening to 'Machine Head'

0545128285|5.0|I really enjoyed THE TALES OF BEEDLE THE BARD.  In addition to the tales themselves, it has an analysis by Albus Dumbledore after each one which gives his thoughts and any relevant history pertaining to it.  There are also footnotes inserted by him and by JKR in these commentaries on the tales.  (The ones that are needed to explain something that a non-Brit would need to know, for example, have \\"--JKR\\" after them.  However, the footnotes that are being explained by Dumbledore himself don't have any name or initials following them.)      You can easily see JKR's intelligent wit in everything written in this book.  When she writes as Dumbledore, it reminds you exactly how Dumbledore sounded in the Harry Potter series.  Her humor is still as dead-on and interesting as always.    I'm glad that I now know the other Beedle tales (those that weren't read word-for-word in DEATHLY HALLOWS), because they really complement the one that was included in DH, namely THE TALE OF THE THREE BROTHERS.  They add to the flavor and understanding of the wizarding world.  If you are the type of Harry Potter fan who always enjoying learning new things about it, you'll enjoy this book.
0956010903|5.0|To the reviewer that asked if they just got a 'dud' copy because the metal corners were not straight and the clasp was in the wrong spot - I would say you must have.  The copy I recieved is beautiful.  The 'box' (Hogwart's style school book-box, not the cardboard Amazon one :-) that this collectors edition is packed in is almost worth the $100 to me.  I was terribly afraid that it would be cheap cardboard, but was happily surprised at the quality (The velvet lining is so nice it feels like suede).  The reproduction of the actual book is very well done. Even the faux moonstones are the correct color.  If I had one small complaint it would be that I think the edges of the pages should have been left rough as there were on the original.
0393061310|5.0|In this book Jared Diamond attempts to answer a question put to him by his New Guinean friend, \\"Why is it that you whit people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people has little cargo of our own?\\"<br /><br />In New Guineas `cargo' is the term used  to refer to goods, such as metal, guns, mirrors, axes, matches, clothing etc. The question is basically, `What factors led to one land having more technology advancement while another did not.<br /><br />IQ tests have been shown to be culturally based.

Advanced technology, centralized political organization, and other features of complex societies could emerge only in dense sedentary populations capable of accumulating food surpluses - populations that depended for their food on the rise of agriculture that began around 8,500 BC But the domesticable wild plant and animal species essential for that rise of agriculture were evenly distributed very unevenly over the continents. The most valuable domesticable wild species were concentrated in only nine small areas of the globe, which thus became the earliest homelands of agriculture. The original inhabitants of those homelands thereby gained a head start towards developing guns, germs (ex. smallpox) and steel. The Language and genes of those homeland inhabitants, as well as their livestock, crops, technologies and writing systems became dominant in the ancient and modern world.\\"<br /><br />In other words, it is not that one group of people is more `fitter' for survival than another, it is the environment on which they depend and draw from that lead to their success or loss in conquering their neighbors.<br /><br />The early 19th century Maori are a great example of how a technological and cultural advancement led to a cultural destabilization which in turn led to massive conquering (and death).<br /><br />One tribe, which was closer to the point of contact with the first colonial ships to New Zealand (land of the Maori), was able to acquire muskets before other tribes. Muskets gave them a definitive advantage over other tribes still using bow and arrows. In addition to this they were the first to get potatoes, which provided more nutrition than the sweet potatoes than they grew. Now they could travel long distances because of an advantage in food supply. With the two advantages in food and weapons they began exterminating other tribes around them. Conquering territory. The tribes that delayed acquiring their own muskets and potatoes were completely wiped out. Those that did acquire were able to stay alive till a new balance of power was reached. By that time a quarter of the population had been wiped out.<br /><br />The lucky tribe that happened to be where the colonials first landed saw themselves as divinely chosen to conquer the rest of the island.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|Pixar brings the most endearing and sympathetic machine since R2-D2 to the screen in \\"WALL-E\\", an animated feature about a trash-compacting droid left on Earth long after humans abandoned the planet. It has been 700 years since Earth became a garbage-strewn wasteland unfit for life. But WALL-E continues to go about his daily routine of compacting trash into cubes and stacking them sky-high. He's never without an Igloo cooler for collecting interesting relics, which he takes back to a home he has made for himself in some sort of defunct vehicle. But WALL-E is lonely. His only companions are a cockroach and old videos. One day a rocket lands on Earth and deposits a slick, hovering new droid called EVE. EVE has a single-minded mission and a deadly blue laser beam. But WALL-E does all he can to stick by his new friend.<br /><br />\\"WALL-E\\" is clever and funny for kids and adults. Its creativity is astounding, especially in the Earth sequences early in the film. I was especially impressed by the film's ability to make its characters' plight affecting with almost no dialogue. I can't say that \\"WALL-E\\" resembles a silent film, because it is very dependent upon sound effects. But it does share an intensely cinematic nature with silent film; the dialogue of the main characters is almost limited to two words, their names. Comparisons to R2-D2 are not a coincidence. \\"WALL-E\\"'s sound designer Ben Burtt was the same who did the sound effects for \\"Star Wars\\". The two robots sound nothing alike, but what little they say has great personality. WALL-E is aided by a team of top-notch animators, of course.<br /><br />Director and co-writer Andrew Stanton has said that he had no socio-political agenda in making the film. The trash-strewn planet was just meant to provide a reason for why WALL-E would be left alone on Earth. Regardless of what was intended, I took the allusions to conspicuous consumption and waste and the fat, inactive humans luxuriating on a resort space ship to be deliberate in their criticisms. But it's true that these ideas remain in the background and are easily overlooked, for better or worse, because the characters are so captivating. Pixar is back in its stride with \\"Ratatouille\\" and \\"WALL-E\\" after the just-for-kids flicks \\"Finding Nemo\\" and \\"Cars\\". \\"WALL-E\\" is great fun for all ages. I laughed out loud.

1853262390|5.0|By far Virginia Woolf's most lighthearted and appealing book. But it is also by far her most profound meditation on reading and writing, identity and art, history and time.<br /><br />  Strictly speaking \\"Orlando\\" is a pseudo literary biography that mocks literary biography (and representation in general). In place of a person Woolf creates a fantastic hybrid and the metamorphoses that occurs simply underlines the unreality, the utterly fabricated nature, of her creation and of all writerly creations. But its also much more than that for Orlando allows Woolf the opportunity to comment on one of her own creations as she is creating it. The writer transforms the world with her words but she is also transformed by the words that she uses. In this way one can view reading and writing as ongoing metamorphoses.<br /><br />  No other book in existence so proudly announces what it is not: real. No other book calls attention to the fact that it is merely literature--a figment of a writers fancy-- in such a graceful way. And yet few books have the imaginative power to so transform the readers who encounter it as this one.
B000004712|4.0|Herbie Hancock is no stranger to catchy songs, or even MTV (think of Rockit), so finding a disc of pop covers in his catalogue should be no surprise.  Hancock assembled an impressive band - Michael Brecker (sax), John Scofield (guitar), Dave Holland (bass), Jack DeJohnette (drums), and Don Alias (percussion).  The focus is on playing straight jazz, not any form of jazz fusion.  The jazzier they play the song, the better the result.  Don Henley's \\"New York Minute\\" gets things off to a good start.  \\"Mercy Street\\" by Peter Gabriel is pretty good.  \\"Norwegian Wood\\" by Lennon/McCartney has additional strings and horns, but the song rises above the additional mushiness.  \\"When Can I See You\\" is a Babyface song that is done too smoothly for me to enjoy much.  Stevie Wonder's \\"You've Got It Bad Girl\\" is good, though Sade's \\"Love Is Stronger Than Pride\\" is a little too smooth.  \\"Scarborough Fair\\" by Simon & Garfunkel is pretty good, and Prince's \\"Thieves In The Temple\\" gets a funky workout.  I was curious to hear Nirvana's \\"All Apologies\\", since Kurt Cobain wasn't the sort to use jazzy chords or progressions.  There's a repeating synthesizer or distorted bass or guitar sound, then Hancock plays a verse and chorus straight before bluesily improvising the rest.  \\"Manhatten\\" is an original that is done as a piano solo.     This is a good CD overall.  I enjoy listening to it, but somehow the concept doesn't draw me strongly to it.  Anyone curious about it, or a big Herbie fan will probably enjoy it.

0807126063|5.0|Another reviewer wrote that this book was the funniest he'd ever read and I totally agree with him.  The characters, starting with the bizarre Ignatius P. Reilly, are to die for.  Knowing some of the characters who hang out in 'The Quarter', I realize that Toole used character-types that he had encountered in Louisiana and especially odd-ball New Orleans.<br /><br />After over 900 reviews I won't even make a stab at summarizing this wonderful book but, as most of you know, Toole unfortunately committed suicide before publication or even acceptance.  I heard that his mother, on finding the manuscript in his apartment, haunted agent/publisher offices until she found someone who would actually read it.  The rest is history.<br /><br />Toole wrote another book, \\"The Neon Bible\\", when he was only 17.  I recommend that those who love 'Confederacy' pick up 'Neon.'  It is a very different book than 'Confederacy' but the insights about human nature that Toole had at only age 17 are awesome, even a little frightening.  When I think about Toole's suicide, I think about these two books...maybe Toole knew too much and what he knew, killed him.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite, author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Conquest of Mexico
0956010903|5.0|Admittedly as the time neared and having ordered multiple copies I was having trepidation about what I might end up with.  Let me just say, I no longer feel that way.  The packing box itself is collectible, warning Muggles to not distribute this before Dec 4th.  That was a nice beginning to the opening of this gem.   As others have said, the packaging is phenomenal and when I slid the main box out of its protective cover I gave a gasp - it is a thing of beauty.  Alone it is truly one of the all-time great book boxes (I collect them).  I was worried it was going to be vinyl but not it looks like a real, old Hogwarts book.  They did themselves proud with that.  Then I opened the box which I found very well made and gave another gasp - there was a beautiful velvet interior with the pouch and the prints.  I took out the pouch and brought out the tome and gave my 3rd gasp - it is a thing of terrifying beauty.  All in all, a very high quality presentation and surely to end up a valued treasure in anyone's library, certainly mine.  Bravo Amazon!  Thank you for replicating your amazing purchase and thank you for making it truly legendary.  Bravo!    Update:  I will reinterate what other's have said - the collectible edition is a remarkable piece of work.  I love that book, it is beautifully done - the cover, the metal decorations, the paper, the fontography are all gorgeous.  But let me tell you a secret.  You see, I am a collector of book boxes as well and let me tell you, the book box that the collector's book comes in has to be the prize of my book box collection.  I was expecting something of lesser quality - a seamed vinyl covered cardboard thing like the other Potter materials.  It is not that.  It is a beautiful piece of work that looks and feels like engraved leather.  I've shown this around to other collectors of magic and they were highly impressed.  They, like me, felt the book box alone was worth it.  Sorry, just had to share my fetish.
0956010903|5.0|The book cames really well packed safe from nearly anything Mom Nature throws at it.  The \\"Book\\" that holds the book is very cool and looks like branded leather and shuts with a magnet the velour inside pocket holds prints of art done by J.K. Rowling, and of course The Tales of Beedle the Bard. It has metal corner protectors each is different and represents a story in the book and a shield in the middle with a skull and moonstone like gems.  best of all it contains the stories we love!
B000G6R7B8|5.0|This is my second Seiko 5 automatic watch I have owned cheap quartz watches before this but these are a huge value for the dollar. Automatic watches are not for everyone you need to wear the watch 8 hours a day every day or buy a watch winder if you dont wear it ever it will stop and need to be reset. If you are kind of a gearhead and want a relationship with your watch these are the watches to have.  Pros- High quality for the money, nice medium size not too bulky, nice smooth sweep on seconds hands not jerky like a quartz, no battery to change.  Cons- day date setting at month end is a bit tricky, setting instructions not well written, must be worn every day to avoid stopping, time accuracy is decent for a mechanical watch but dont expect a quartz accuracy. I would buy another if I had a watch winder but keeping two going is my limit
B001GKJ2F2|5.0|This review is for; [[ASIN:B001GKJ2F2 Wanted (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]<br /><br />Clearly this is the type of movie you can only enjoy if you don't take the specific details too seriously. Just enjoy the action packed ride of stunts and special effects! The action is way over the top, but is very stylishly done. There are a lot of slow motion effects (and speeded up effects too!), scenes that go in reverse, bullet skin-piercing close-ups and car stunts that clearly look impossible, but are nevertheless still fun to watch! Great DVD to own and I think it could be enjoyed with repeated viewings!<br /><br />Rather than go over the plot and film details as many other reviewers have, I just \\"wanted\\" point out the features for the two-disc DVD set. If you live near Target their two-disc DVD set or Blue-Ray set contains a Target exclusive 22-page booklet with production notes and photos. Very nice to have!<br /><br />The bonus disc of \\"Wanted\\" has nearly 90 minutes of special features. A digital copy of the movie is included that you can download to your PC, I-pod or other video player. There is one extended scene (not deleted) when Wesley Gibson is shooting at the three dead corpses that is actually kind of humorous to watch, but only adds about two minutes to the film. The other featurettes are called; \\"Cast & Characters\\", \\"Stunts on the L Train\\", \\"Special Effects: The Art of the Impossible\\", \\"Groundbreaking Visual Effects: From Imagination to Execution\\", \\"Origins of Wanted: Bringing the Graphic Novel to Life\\", \\"Through the Eyes of Director Timur Bekmamvetov\\", \\"Making of Wanted the Video Game\\", eight scenes from the comic book with narration (very interesting!) and a music video for the Danny Elfman song \\"The Little Things\\".<br /><br />Unfortunately there is no commentary for the feature film, but the numerous featurettes range from approximately 2 minutes (L Train Stunts) to 10 or 20 minutes for the remaining featurettes, so there is a lot of extra content to see. Most of the featurettes are your standard cast, crew interviews with your standard behind the scenes footage and film footage. Most of the stunts are done with the actual actors/actresses fitted with harnesses and green-screen backgrounds.  Very interesting to see the car flipping and the train under the bridge stunts!<br /><br />I found the comic book narration very interesting to watch and to see how different or similar the movie compared to the comic book adaptation. For example, the female assassin \\"Fox\\" (played by Angelina Jolie) was originally conceived as an African-American female. If you are into the video game of \\"Wanted\\", some special codes pop up on the screen after you watch two of the featurettes on the bonus disc. I think the codes give your video game character better life or killing modes, but I'm not exactly sure since I don't have a copy of the game myself. Overall, this is a good two-disc set to have. I still wish there could have been a commentary track, but the numerous special features on the second disc kind of make up for it. Recommended and very fun to watch!standard cast, crew interviews with your standard behind the scenes footage and film footage.

B000000OQF|5.0|Cd rock's all the way. Awesome guitar sounds. Amazing vocals and nice drum work hard driveing. Like Welcome to the jungle nightrain it's so easy. Mr brownstone. And the great song Sweet child o mine. All songs on here are great most albums not nearly as good as GUN's N' ROSES. Appetite For Destruction. Great album to have.
B0013FNC38|5.0|the cd prompted me to go see him live, best two hours of live music i've heard in a loooooong time.  he can do everything, sing, move (mmhmmm), be funny, keep the audience totally engaged....buy this cd, it's the next best thing to being there.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|Here's the thing... When you think Indiana Jones, you think quality action film. This was not quality by any means.    1st of all, how can Indy's father of died? At the end of The Last Crusade, he drank from the Holy Grail so he's supposed to have eternal life. Instead of killing him off, just leave him out altogether.    Then, ALIENS?! Are you serious?! This is an archeologist, not a UFO researcher. Just terrible. I saw it in the theater and really felt like I was ripped off. It's not even worth renting, much less buying.
B0012K1ILW|2.0|I get the CD, and the message behind the songs. It's not some deep tripped out experience such as with Esthero. It took a long time to comment on this album, and I gave it many listens.<br /><br />The take on it, is too much humming, noise, weird effects, and not enough of Erykah's talent shining through. Out of the 10 tracks only 4-5 are worth a listen. We spend money to here music, to hear a good cd not a few good tracks. Part 2? At this rate, she will lose all her fans before that.

B0001L3LUE|4.0|Director Errol Morris starts his DVD by questioning Robert McNamara, the only person in view. McNamara begins to reminisce over his decades of experience. This is where the eleven lessons begin. Considering the political and military course of action the United States has taken in the past eight years, some of these lessons should be bronzed, and prominently displayed. Here are the ones that stuck most in my memory:<br /><br />Empathize with your enemy.<br /><br />Critics mistake empathy for sympathy or appeasement--a word most often misused. It means neither. Understanding your enemy is one of the most important things in defeating your enemy, or not engaging him in the first place. The example given by McNamara was the one person during the Cuban missile crisis who knew Premier Nikita Khruschev. He was the only one who counselled JFK against getting tougher with the Soviets. He knew that the US had to throw a political bone to Khruschev so that he would look tough against the Americans, at least to the hard core communists in the Politburo. It worked and nuclear war was averted.<br /><br />Rationality will not save us.<br /><br />There is a mistaken assumptions that if you gather rational people in one place to think rationally, they will always make the best decision or come up with the best course of action. According to McNamara, even rational people can make egregious errors in judgment.<br /><br />Proportionality should be a guideline in war.<br /><br />A lack of proportional response will not only get innocents killed, it will also kill our own.  Nothing should be overkill. (As the ancient Greeks said, nothing in excess; everything in moderation.)<br /><br />Belief and Seeing are both often wrong.<br /><br />The wisdom in this one had perhaps the most profound effect on me. This should be self-explanatory. From what we believe and even see, we can still draw incorrect conclusions e.g. while we were searching for weapons of mass destruction, Washington signalled our forces that there were caves in a mountain where Iraqi missiles might be hidden. They turned out to be places to store water for cattle.<br /><br />Be prepared to reexamine your reasoning,<br /><br />especially if believing and seeing are both often wrong. It took sixteen centuries for someone to actually challenge Galen's idea of bloodletting.<br /><br />In order to do good, you may have to engage in evil.<br /><br />This is a Machiavellian reference to war. But Mr. McNamara raised the following question: How much evil must we do in order to do good? This made me revisit my belief that the US was justified in dropping the atomic bombs on Hiroshima or Nagasaki. Was this too much evil? Would we really have had to invade Japan if we didn't drop the bomb? Be prepared to reexamine your reasoning if you have no doubt that this would have been necessary.<br /><br />You can't change human nature.<br /><br />Reason has limits according to the former Secretary of Defense. Back in the days, one of my hippie friends reasoned that no one would die if everyone just got rid of their guns. This was an oversimplification of human nature, but still recognizable in many ways today. We cannot force people to like things our way, or what value what we hold dear. It is not their nature.<br /><br />Near the end, Mr. McNamara quotes T.S. Eliot: \\"We shall not cease from exploring and at the end of our exploration we will return to where we started and know the place for the first time.\\" This sums up the \\"Fog of War.\\"<br /><br />This was a worthwhile viewing (rather than buying) for the above lessons I hope I will remember for the rest of my life. The only disappointment was Secretary McNamara's vagueness or refusal to discuss some of the more controversial decisions  and issues of his life. He was very thoughtful of John F. Kennedy, and still wept in relating the event. He was also thoughtful of his wife who died several years ago. I got the impression that he is a lonely man who has made peace with himself and his demons.<br /><br />This will give you  some clear insights.<br /><br />Forty-five days and a wake-up until the fog leaves Foggy Bottom.til the fog leaves Foggy Bottom.
0956010903|5.0|Ok so I've been waiting for this book for a long time now. Since the book was announced to have  a limited number of copies available I made sure that I got my order in early. Like, August early. And the fact that it is still in stock you can only imagine how pleased I am with that decision I made, and not to mention the \\"limited quantity\\" of the edition... But this is not the place to talk about that. The whole time waiting I was filled with doubts about it. Not the stories themselves, but the Collectors Edition itself, and the fact the I paid $100 for it..<br /><br />Let me say that again...<br /><br />$100... for a book. In these tough times we live in where people are losing jobs and houses..<br /><br />I paid $100 for a book.<br /><br />So for 4 months while I was wondering what the hell was I thinking, all I could do was hope that the book delivered it's hype, both with it's stories and the quality of the edition itself.<br /><br />And to be honest, I couldn't be happier with the outcome of both.<br /><br />When the day it was being delivered came I was beyond excited. I was watching for that UPS truck like I haven't eaten in weeks and the driver was bringing me a giant Twinkie. When the package was finally delivered after what felt like the longest day in the history of the world I felt like a little school girl (which I'm not) when I read the printing on box. I'm not going into details about the box because I'm sure that people who don't even like Harry Potter know what the thing says. Anyways, I opened the box so quickly yet so carefully I felt like I was about to implode. When I finally got to the goods after paper, cardboard, plastic, and more cardboard, I was taken back by how nicely done the entire thing was put together. It's something that when held you just feel like it's an object taken right from the books (the Harry Potter series.) I feel that for fans it's a no brainer to have this edition of the book.<br /><br />And to tell you the truth, the Collectors Edition is the only way to read it because of the feel of it and the place that it puts you in when you have it in your hands. To make it understandable let me say that if you pass it up and just get the regular version it'll be like going into an ice cream parlor and ordering a hot fudge sundae  with whipped cream, nuts and a cherry and the guy gives you a scoop of chocolate yogurt. You know something is not right and something's missing but you eat it anyway because you figure, \\"hey, I like chocolate.\\"<br /><br />And if you're reading this and that's your attitude then go ahead and go crazy with your chocolate yogurt. Just know that you're reading this because something inside you really does want this Collectors Edition. And if you go ahead and get the regular edition and feel that something missing, I'll be too busy reading these amazing stories to hear you kicking yourself in the ....<br /><br />Oh yeah, the stories!<br /><br />This is already a long enough review so let me get to the point. The stories in this book are something else. Sure, if you really think about it you'd swear you've heard them before, but that's the beauty of it, you haven't. It's 5 unique stories that really do feel like they've  been read to young witches and wizards for years. Stories that carry the same morals and lessons that we've learned from our own tales of old. There's even one story in here that made me read it twice because I couldn't believe how dark and twisted it was. While I was reading this book I honestly saw myself reading it to my future children as bedtime stories (besides that twisted one.) The entire book can be read in a day or less but how many times have you read or stood to listen tales like Sleeping Beauty, Hansel and Gretel, Rumpelstiltskin, Rapunzel, Cinderella? And it's because of that fact that I cannot stress my argument enough. Would you read these wizard tales to your kids from a nice little book that looks like it came from somewhere and meanssomething, or a regular ol' looking hardback?<br /><br />The choice is yours. I made mine.. and it tastes like hot fudge.mine.. and it tastes like hot fudge.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I just ordered my DVD but my original thoughts were blogged on July 18, and they still stand; well, of course:    Whether you are or aren't an acolyte of Joss Whedon, do yourself a favor and view this 45-minute serial TV show made for the Internet (and now on DVD).    This was an experiment devised by Whedon, two of his brothers, a writer friend of theirs, and countless others who contributed, during the fairly recent (now months ago) WGA strike.  The artists on this project basically worked for free, with Joss Whedon and a few others ponying up the funds.    Dr. Horrible is the tale of a mad scientist (Neil Patrick Harris), would-be villain who wants with his entire being to be part of the Evil League of Evil, run by an Uber-Villain Overlord named Bad Horse.  Why?  He's in love with a girl named Penny, who he's afraid to talk to but wants to rule the world with.  She in turn falls for a big lug with half a brain called Captain Hammer.  Hammer and Dr. H have a hate-hate relationship, mostly because Hammer keeps giving him beatings and messing up his plans for world domination.    Did I mention it's a musical?  The whole thing is brilliantly devised; archetypes of villains and heroes turned on their head, a sweet young thing who is their innocent catalyst for change, and a tuneful score which harks to musical theatre influences ... some Bernstein, some  Schwartz, with emphasis on Sondheim.  Whedon and his co-writers obviously love language and know how to use it to warp the woof of an oft-told tale; good vs. evil.  But just who is good and who is evil?  And for whom will you weep when the story is through?     Write and tell me.  I'd like to know what you thought.    On the surface, looking at photos, reading synopses here and there, you might be fooled that this is just a trifle, a silly confection.  Those unfamiliar with Whedon's previous artistic outings are in for a surprise.  The ending is being hotly debated even as I write this.  There's a lot for everyone here; musical enthusiasts to comic-book fans, to dramaturgs.    Watch how well the tone shifts from Act to Act, with the music supporting all the action.  Act I is the honeymoon, Act II the divorce, and Act III \\"the great black pit\\" in more ways than one.     Neil Patrick Harris is a star - if that wasn't already clear.  His singing and acting runs the gamut from sweetly hopeful, to sarcastic, to morose, to black outrage and despair.  If Act III doesn't prove that you can become hollowed out through your own mistaken desires, nothing will.    Nathan Fillion plays the \\"Hero,\\" Captain Hammer.  I don't want to give too much away if you haven't seen it yet, but let's just say his performance is the perfect capital P for pompous.  I'm not surprised he delivers on the singing - a very talented man who is not afraid to spoof his own image as someone who is adored, but in a totally obnoxious way.  He's equal parts lecherous Judge Turpin from Sweeney Todd and Judd Frye from Oklahoma.  Not easy to pull off.    Felicia Day (who has her own show The Guild on the Internet Highway) plays Penny, the innocent ingenue who tries to stay positive in a wicked, bad world.  Tries to make a difference despite indifference.  Day is competent, sweet and smart in a role that doesn't give her much to do.  It felt as though she really had to pull back her own personality to make it fit within the confines of a role that doesn't change or grow.  But she is there for a definite purpose.    How we could be taken on this journey in such a short series. I'm a believer that all things are possible. Especially when there's Whedons involved.
0956010903|5.0|I was surprised that the book decorations weren't of higher quality.  HOWEVER this is still an awesome book, and its little pouch is nice too.  I waited anxiously all afternoon for the UPS truck, and it didn't land on my doorstep until after 7:30 PM.  But I actually liked the packaging box and it was fun to open each layer.  I loved her introduction, especially her commentary on Muggle fairy tales.  I have 6 year old daughters who are so into the @#$*@@! princess stuff.  I can't wait until they get into Harry Potter!  This little book will be quite a gem to pull out at the right time.    I am glad that Rowling decided, after handwriting the tales, to publish a version for the public, and I'm glad the charity gets money too.  The prints are great also.
B0015XHP4K|1.0|Horrible movie. C'mon! Rambo?! Its like my Grandpa trying to scare me! Not realistic. I enjoyed the first ones...but this is Too much
B0017IYWEE|5.0|The more I hear of Damrau, the more amazed I become.<br />This array of Mozart arias demonstrates her exceptional vocal capabilities and astounding range. There is nothing lacking in style and articulation.<br />But what is most astonishing is not vocal technique.  It is the ability of this singer to express herself through the medium of singing.<br />Vitellia's aria from La Clemenza di Tito is a hideously difficult piece of vocal writing, so hideous because, as musical historians found out, Mozart himself hated Vitellia. The more he hated this character, the more difficulty he injects into her music.<br />Just listen to Damrau's handling of this hideous piece. I have heard many top sopranos/mezzos singing this before - Eva Mei, Anne Sofie von Otter, just to name two recent ones. None of them, however beautiful they handle the piece, could sound convincing enough. And Rene Jacobs' version of La Clemenza a couple of years ago introduced a fiendishly capable Vitellia in the form of Bulgarian coloratura Alexandrina Pendatchanska. No lacking in expressiveness, I thought then that this Vitellia is unsurpassable.<br />Well, let me report that Damrau does indeed surpassed Pendatchanska's interpretation. Damrau's Vitellia is so alive and believable: fear, regret, remorse, hesitation, resolution, all bound up in Mozart's musical lines, and so effectively articulated by Damrau. The aria becomes at once totally explicable - Mozart did NOT in fact lacked one jot of empathy for his Vitellia, however much he might have disliked her.<br />Thank you, Ms. Damrau, for your great interpretation.
B001GKJ2E8|3.0|The movie was not half bad. Very UNREALISTIC in EVERYTHING. Jolie is beautiful to watch and the action scene were shot great. The story line, on the other hand, was o.k. Watch just for the action shots.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|\\"The Dark Knight\\" is superlative filmmaking.<br /><br />Masterful screenplay, directing, acting, music, production design, special effects, editing and ... the list goes on.  Widely praised by international reviews and nearing $1 billion in global revenue, this Blu-ray DVD continues this excellence in every department -- image. sound and extras.  But alas, no Christopher Nolan or Christian Bale commentaries.<br /><br />The image quality and sound are as good as technically possible.  Hard to imagine a better looking  movie.  Especially the opening Imax-filmed bank heist.  There is not a more immersive image-capturing system available and on a high-end TV, the transfer is eye-popping.<br /><br />Although Warner Bros. rarely makes DVD sales public, I'm willing to bet this is the first million selling Blu-ray disc.<br /><br />The theme of this movie resonates deeply.  First, there's iconic terrorist imagery, especially regarding Sept. 11 (silhouette girders in smoke). The ideas of \\"chaos for the sake of chaos\\" and \\"how do you fight an evil that has no rules\\" is intelligently as well as viscerally exploited.  \\"Some people just want to see the world burn.\\"  Exactly.  Ring a bell?<br /><br />Also, there is always the problem of killing in the name of a moral cause.  How much innocent death is justified? Issues of war in Iraq come to mind.<br /><br />This brilliant film is packaged cleverly with an outer sleeve mockingly vandalized by the Joker.<br /><br />The extras are succinctly edited and are generous.  They cover key movie elements.  I was especially taken by an inside look at Hans Zimmer's music as well as the blending of miniature with full size practical effects.  On Disc 2, there's a terrific examination of Batman from a psychoanalytic perspective.<br /><br />When all is said and done, the haunting portrayal of The Joker by heath Ledger remains in the memory.  No doubt he will be posthumously nominated for an Academy Award. He'll probably win.  He deserves it.  Shedding this role is probably what led to his demise.<br /><br />Strongest recommendation. This is what hi-def DVDs are all about.  Finally.ngest recommendation. This is what hi-def DVDs are all about.  Finally.

B00000633U|5.0|If ever there was an album that needed to be reissued, it's Seven and the Ragged Tiger by Duran Duran, but this one is pretty good too. I LOVE Richard Marks! His songs bring back so many great memories of my time dominating the sports and dating scene in Syracuse. Let me list the things about Richard Marks that rule:    1. His hair- Top that look my friend  2. His jackets- He could pull off a leather jacket  3. His music- Probably the third best thing about him, but it was awesome.    My favorite song off this classic is Angelia, but there is not a bad track on this. Let me tell you a little story about Richard Marks as it relates to my life. We had an 8th grade dance. There are only so many slow songs during an 8th grade dance and there is only one of me, so quite a few girls were going to be disappointed. I was like an 80s Barack Obama in that is was smooth and just promised lots of things to make people happy. I told about 9 girls I would let them slow dance with me and touch my cool generra shirt. Once I got to the dance, they all had their Bpimp tickets so I was stuck. I had the DJ play Right Here Waiting 9 straight times. Everyone was happy. The girls got there dance and everyone got to hear Richard Marks 9 times in a row. Who loses in that scenario?    I'll tell you who loses, Average once again when it takes me on.

B001DDBCUU|2.0|I was prepared to give this four stars until I found out about [[ASIN:B001IZZEEI Sex and the City: The Movie (The Wedding Collection Ultimate Collectors Edition)]] being released next week.  Now I understand why the disc I shelled out better than $20 for is so light on extras.  I was a fool not to realize that, as ever, HBO had something even bigger in the goodie bag that they were saving for later.<br /><br />So what do you get with this 2-disc \\"special\\" edition?  For starters, there's nothing \\"special\\" about it, unless you use the word as euphemism for that oh-so-unpolitically correct word \\"retarded.\\"  The extra features could have easily fit onto one disc, because there are only four of them: deleted scenes, a feature on the fashion, a boring conversation with Michael Patrick King and Sarah Jessica Parker that goes in circles and a four minute \\"studio session\\" with singer Fergie, who did the main title song.  The only interesting thing about that dull feature is when Fergie says she \\"grew up\\" watching the show.  Considering she was 23 when the show started, that makes her either an idiot or a liar.  There is a feature commentary by Michael Patrick King that's worth listening to, but it's maddening that he never talks about what happened to Stanford Blatch's boyfriend, Marcus.  In Season 5 of the series, Stanford wound up with the happily ever after that all the girls were searching for, and fans of the show were elated for him.  But Marcus is inexplicably nowhere to be found in the movie, and from the way MPK and Co. carry on, it's as if he never existed.  Perhaps that mystery will be solved for the price of $50 if you buy the deluxe edition.<br /><br />I liked the movie a lot, which is why I avoided giving the disc a single star.  What I don't like is the fact that I once again feel as if HBO has given me the short end of the stick.  I had no idea that an ACTUAL \\"special\\" edition was coming out next week, or I wouldn't have bought this slap-dash edition last week.  At this point, the fact that this 2-disc extended edition comes with a digital copy that is the original theatrical version, so that you get both versions of the movie essentially for the price of one, is the only positive thing I can say about the DVD.k.

0765316897|4.0|In _Mistborn_ Kelsier's Crew of thieves plots an outrageously clever heist and the eventual overthrow of the Lord Ruler.  In _The Well of Ascension_ the characters are challenged and develop as they need to cope with the chaos of what happens after a totalitarian ruler of a thousand-year empire falls.  The trilogy concludes with our heroes still trying to keep war and chaos at bay... and having to deal with a godlike power, Ruin, who escaped from the Well of Ascension (and had been secretly plotting its escape for millennia) and wants to destroy the world.  Elend, now Emperor, and Vin, his Empress, find out that the Lord Ruler may have been a bad guy, but Ruin is worse, and the Lord Ruler had foreseen its escape.  They follow clues left by the Lord Ruler in hopes of finding an answer and save the world.<br /><br />In the meantime, there are plots and diplomacy and battles and balls.  The crew are much diminished, the action focusing on Elend and Vin, but all have a part to play (some more than others).  Elend,Vin and Ham are besieging Fadrex City, where one of the Lord Ruler's secret caches is located.  They fight the inhuman Koloss and the Inquisitors who control them.  Spook and Breeze and Sazed are in Urteau, site of another cache, attempting to free the city from the harsh rule of a follower of the Church of the Survivor.  TenSoon, the shape-changing Kandra, has returned to his people to face trial and imprisonment--and internal politics.<br /><br />The conclusion is dramatic and action-packed and a worthy end to a fine fantasy trilogy.  We finally get answers to why the world is as it is, and learn more about Allomancy and the other forms of magic.  And more about the races that inhabit the world, and their origin.  There are lots of twists and turns and it's just a roller-coaster of a ride.<br /><br />My one quibble is with Sazed, who is trying to cope with the death of the one he loved and is searching for the perfect religion so that he can believe in something.  Those parts are a little slow and repetitive, and often made me bounce out of the story a bit, wondering if the author's beliefs were intruding (what with Ruin manipulating text and people and after having just seen Proposition 8 passed here in CA, perhaps I was being just a little too paranoid?  Or perhaps not).  At any rate, I was troubled a bit by it, but decided that even if some proselytizing may have been going on, I could try and ignore it and keep the fantasy world as divorced as possible from the religious and political pitfalls of this world.a little slow and repetitive, and often made me bounce out of the story a bit, wondering if the author's beliefs were intruding (what with Ruin manipulating text and people and after having just seen Proposition 8 passed here in CA, perhaps I was being just a little too paranoid?

0545128285|5.0|Since I loved the Harry Potter series, I could not wait for this book to be released. The tales are wonderful which provide great insight and good morals for kids as well as adults (I think for young kids, an adult should discuss the moral of the stories).    As one review stated that he loved the book being over 20. I am 36 and I enjoyed the stories and felt it was a nice companion next to my Harry Potter books.    It should be noted that the morals of the stories, though true about life, are generally forgotten by adults.
B001HDO4Z6|4.0|With highly hit successful album `Viva la Vida or Death and all his friends' still on heavy rotation on my iPod.  I, along with many other Coldplay fans must have wondered how long they would have to go without new material.  Well the answer was within the same year!  The album is clearly from the `Viva la Vida' sessions and is also shown through the similar cover art as well as the music.  The question is, is it just the leftovers from `Viva la Vida' or have these songs narrowly missed out or just didn't fit.    Well the album can be split into two halves; you have the remixes then you have the new stuff.  First of all I'll take you through the remixes. The album kicks off with `Life in Technicolor II' and it is exactly what it says on the tin.   What I thought was great about `Life in Technicolor' off `Viva' was that it was an instrumental.  Clearly though Martin couldn't keep quiet, making this basically `Life in Technicolor 1 plus vocals.  While the instrumental works from the album.  This opener works for this EP.  It is clear during the `Viva' sessions Martin has changed his vocal style and it fits well with the songs especially laid on top of this track.  Meanwhile `Lost +' sees Jay Z rap over the bridge section of the song.  It is a small change to the song which works extremely well.  Finally `Lovers in Japan (Osaka sun remix) is like playing a game of spot the difference with the original.  It must be a really subtle change because it is very difficult to spot any sort of a difference with the original.    Now for the new stuff; you can see from `LIT2', Martin has a tough time staying quiet.  So what was the compromise with this EP?  That's right a 48 second instrumental, named `Postcards from far away'. When instrumentals are this short they act more as interludes rather than count as a song.  It is a nice piano piece but it is far too short.  After this comes `Glasses of Water' which in my opinion fit right into `Viva la Vida' and is by far the strongesttrack on the EP.  It is Martin's singing with `Sun' in the chorus which is just fantastic.    The other tracks; `Rainy day', `Prospekt's March' and `Now my feet won't touch the ground' are your lower tempo Coldplay songs.  They are good but the standards set through `Viva' were so high it is not quite the same level.  In particular `Now my feet won't touch the ground' is an excellent closer to the album.     Overall this is a good solid EP. The remixes are often subtle but on the whole well executed while the new tracks are worth a listen and almost up to the standard of `Viva'.  Of course exclude `Glasses of Water' from that list because it is definitely up there with the best of any Coldplay material.  On the whole the Ep was more than worthwhile and acts as a bridge between `Viva' and the new album which is set for release late in 2009.
0956010903|5.0|Amazon exceeded my expectations with this presentation. I have yet to read the stories themselves but I am sure they will be charming and well done. If you are considering getting this you want to know about the presentation and extras.<br /><br />The outer textbook is very well done. It looks and feels like leather and has engraved lettering which adds to the sense of richness and substance. The velvet bag is well a nice velvet bag with J.K.'s signature embroidered in gold thread.<br /><br />The book itself I have a hard time telling apart from the pictures of the original. It feels fantastic to hold in your hand. The clasp is great, the binding is superb. The skull looks aged and you feel like you could have an original 15th century printing of the tales. My only gripe is that they had to put the publication information inside. The presentation feels like you have an original who knows how old book and then you see the ISBN number and copyright information. Wish they could have left that out but really a small trifle.<br /><br />The illustrations are simple and quaint. Printed on nice quality paper and in a nice envelope which has a place on the inside cover of the faux book. I really doubt I will be framing them any time soon but certainly a most welcome addition to the book. If you like folk art though, perhaps you would. J.K.'s introduction is warm and heartfelt. Like the rest it just adds to the pleasure. Any Harry Potter fan would treasure this edition. My guess is at 100,000 copies they will never command a premium price. I collected LOTR high end collectibles and 100,000 is a huge edition size, however as a fund-raiser kudos for Amazon making it this size. Given the quality, even with the edition size, I do not think they are ever going to drop in price either
0545128285|4.0|Rowling creates more questions than she answers in this book. The first one: Is Hermione really a muggle at all? There was a witch years ago with the last name of Granger and Rowling points out that most muggle born witches/wizards have some magic back in the line. Hello? This book is definitely a bridge to the encyclopedia with all of the character back story that she said she intends to write. However, it's an easy read and I read it in one night and find anything Harry Potterish enjoyable.  The fairy tales did not have \\"damsels in distress\\" and I found them to have good enough lessons that I may read them to my muggle children. :)

B0017R5UAA|1.0|That anyone likes this rubbish.  This album is offensive on so many levels it beggars belief.  How does anyone begin to give it 5 stars.  Overrated tosh.  I'm getting angry writing this, just thinking about what I've listened to, sorry endured.  We had a band in the UK years ago, early 80s I think, called The Flying Pickets - they were a steaming bucket of pi*s, and that frankly is what this is.  It does nothing for me and leaves me cold.
0316017922|5.0|I wrote a review a few hours ago, and I wanted to write another that approaches the complaints of people that disliked this book.     Many people have pointed out thing books like \\"emotional intelligence\\" that were published many years ago and over similar subjects. I agree, they do, but Gladwell covers them in a far more interesting and memorable way. Also I think Gladwell's coining a new term \\"practical intelligence\\"  isn't a way of hiding his inspirations. Practical intelligence is a term that is immediately can get the gist of. Practical intelligence is knowledge that can be used to do something. Whereas \\"emotional intelligence\\" sounds like a contradiction in terms.    I found that when I read Gladwell's books I began to like him on a personal level. And I actually felt an immense urge to hurl insults at the naysayers on here.  90 percent of the readers on here rate him highly though so odds are you will too.
B0007OCG56|4.0|The movie is based on Christina Moreno, and her mother, Flor Moreno (Paz Vega), who flee Mexico when Christina is six to search for a better life. Flor and her young daughter travel to Los Angeles to live with Flor's cousin, who helps Flor find paying jobs, and an apartment. She lives a life of comfort in a community which clearly mirrors her past life in Mexico. Finally, after years of comfort, she steps out into what they call \\"a foreign land\\". With the help of her cousin, Flor finds a maid job at the home of John Clasky (Adam Sandler), and his wife Deborah (Tea Leoni). John and Deborah also have two children, Bernice and Georgie, who both seem to have taken a very laid back approach to life, mirroring their father. Also joining the family is Deborah's mother, Evelyn Wright (Cloris Leachman), who takes a back seat to the antics and comes into play at key moments. It seems that at all times, someone in the movie is pulling another person, striving for perfection. Flor is very protective, and very strict with her daughter, attempting to bring her up right besides the fact that Christina has been thrown into this foreign American culture.  While they are living with the Clasky's, Flor begins to realize that the Clasky's and their lifestyle is having a great impact on Christina, and interfering with Flor's attempts at keeping Christina close with her heritage and culture while remaining the only true influence in her daughter's life. The movie culminates at the end with both John and Flor confessing their love for each other, but doing nothing about it. Flor then proceeds to quit her job with the Clasky's severing her ties with the \\"outside world\\". The movie is mostly based around John, Deborah, Flor, and the struggles they have raising their families in two drastically different ways.  Overall, Spanglish is everything a true movie fan would want; comedy, romance, developed characters, and more life lessons than you could ask for.
B000YABIQ6|3.0|In America there was a thing called the culture wars. The right said that up till the sixties things had been going well. The family unit was solid and because it was solid the nation was solid. The key to keeping the family together was strict sexual morality, the acceptance of woman as a home maker and the importance of raising children with strong values. If children had values they did not break the law, worked hard and society prospered.     Along came the sixties and women had conflicting roles. Morality fell apart and the divorce rate went through roof. Single familles were thrown into poverty and crime became rampant. The culture war was an attack on the changes in society in the latter half of the twentieth century which saw the emancipation of woman, ending laws against homosexuality and the development of governmental roles to improve society.     This series appears to be a strong counter attack against the right suggesting a new model of what the fifties were like. It suggests that the developments in the sixties were against a society of the fifties seeped in racism, homophobia and misogyny.     Part of the appeal of the series seems to be a smug satisfaction by the viewer of how much things are better now and what repellent creeps are portrayed in the show. On a superficial level the characters smoke constantly, drink to excess and eat food drenched in dairy products. Anyone seeing the show now would realise that this sort of behaviour would lead to a life expectancy of about fifty. The male characters are white and who despise Jews. Any contact with women is predatory.    And of course there is some truth in the picture. If you want women to not have sexual contact prior to marriage and not to engage in affairs there must be strong social prohibitions in place. Whilst the fifties might have seen lower rates of pre-marital sex it was a period when terms such as \\"slut\\", \\"mole\\" and \\"whore\\" were not only in use but could be used to achieve social exclusion. A society which has \\"strong morality\\" is a society which is intolerant, judgemental and exclusive.     The major problem with the show is not so much the politics it espouses. Rather it is rather slow moving. One is not so much interested in the development of the story. Rather it is like watching a train wreck. It is a bit repellent but you feel compelled to watch it never the less.
1595141715|5.0|This book, by Jay Asher, was an incredible experience for me. From the time I started reading the first page, I was unable to put down the book. I am a teacher at a high school in Orlando, FL and I am facilitating a winter book club. I chose this book because it was on Florida's recommending reading list and the premise sounded interesting. I had no idea of the treat for which I was in store.    I am not going to spoil anything about the book but I will say that I highly recommend this GREAT book and I cannot wait to discuss it with my students after the winter break. Thanks Jay!

0920236251|3.0|This is a great story!  As a third grade teacher, my class and I both enjoy this book.  As someone earlier mentioned, it's great for people 3 to 103!  BUT, I took off 2 stars for the SIZE of the book.  I suppose it's my fault for not looking at the dimensions, but seriously, who makes a book this small?? I definitely won't be able to use this version for read alouds, but I guess my kids will get a kick out of it.  I, however, doubt I will personally read it myself.
B00104JONO|4.0|I am also an adult who just loves musicals.  I got hooked on High School Musical when I saw the very first commercial for the HSM1.  1 and 2 are just awesome, however, even though I think that HSM3 was great I think that there was a little too much music and not enough story.  I really expected more scheming from Sharpay and more story.   I think there should be one more HSM.  High School Musical 4 The Reunion.  It could show us what Troy chose to do for a profession(after college).  I mean is he in theater or he a pro basketball player.  I also think that it would be a great way to have Troy propose to Gabriella.  The wedding could be one of the musicals.

B001F0VHEM|5.0|I have to say this is not my favorite of pinks albums, but it is a great group of songs. though there are a few that i don't really care for, most of the songs are great at worth your time. This album does show a softer side of Pink, and is, for the most part, a very mellow album.    So What, being the first single on the album gives listeners some insight into pinks breakup with Carey Hart, which is what the bulk of the CD is about. Its a great, fun breakup song.    Sober is a great song, and pink herself has stated you dont actually have to drink or do drugs to relate to the song, its entirely about wondering how to feel good jut being you.    Please don't leave me may seem like just a plea from pink to hart and not worth your time, but i actually like it. I find it very easy to relate to and I especially like how personal it is without alienating listeners.    Bad Influence is by far my favorite song on the CD. Its very upbeat and fun, a drastic contrast with most of the rest of the CD.    Though Funhouse is a bit odd, I love it. its a unique song. one of my Favs.    Ave Mary A is an interisting one. I dont quite know what its aiming at, but i really do like it. It keeps the uniqueness of most of the songs while still showing as soft yet edgy side of Pink.
1401219268|2.0|When I read the reviews here and when I learned that TIME ranked \\"Watchmen\\" in the top 100 novels (n.b., not graphic novels) since 1923, I expected something on the same plane as the other works on that list ([...]) -- a genre-busting tour de force. I may be a victim of high expectations, but in my judgment, a masterpiece this is not.<br /><br />\\"Watchmen\\" may have a bit more depth than the average comic (or perhaps it's that it brought about an increase in the depth of the average comic, akin to how the fine but no longer outstanding Mona Lisa was revolutionary in its day), but I don't see it as a worthy recipient of the lavish praise it receives. Don't believe the hype.

B00005JKCH|4.0|Spider-man is a hugely popular film franchise, and it's not without good reason. The first film is great with good acting, great special effects and music, and a great starting point for the story. It involves Peter Parker getting bitten by some kind of genetically enhanced spider, giving him the famous powers Spider-man is known for. After that you get the green goblin involved (a guy who does a science experiment on himself... but it doesn't go so well) and you have some good fight scenes and some cheesy but funny lines. There are a few particularly memorable scenes, the cage fight near the film's beginning being one of them. So overall I highly recommend Spider-man to anyone who likes action movies and now that it's offered for such cheap prices you barely have any excuse to not see it!

B001C08RHA|5.0|Iron Man is a really great movie. Robert Downey Jr. really steals the show with his superb acting job as Tony Stark/Iron Man by being absolutely hilarious all throughout and portraying his character perfectly. The film's soundtrack is also notable, full of electric guitar sound mixed with orchestrated stuff and it sounds great and fits the movie really well. The few action scenes in the movie are really cool, and although the final battle is a little underwhelming, the rest is really fun to watch. There are a lot of great, memorable lines and scenes throughout the movie too, my favorite part is probably when he blows up the tank, man that makes me laugh so hard. Add spectacular visual effects and a promised sequel and you get a movie no superhero film fan should miss, and people outside that category have good reason to enjoy it too.
0743455967|5.0|I've been away from writing for many years and thought I'd start with King's book to get me back into the swing of things. It worked. (I may not be writing to publish, but I am writing--and that's always the first hard step.)    King includes myriad practical tips and techniques for buckling down, staying focused, and pay attention to what's important. King's use of his own experiences as examples of what to do--and what not to do--make the work both personal and moving. His candor is refreshing and his delivery is effortless.    There are two (related) areas I wish he would have addressed in much more detail, since his focus is on the language of writing: cadence and word order.     Stephen, if you're out there, why is cadence so important, and what characteristics determine how it affects the reader?    And why does the title of my review (\\"Instructional, beautiful, invaluable\\") have a different effect than, say, \\"Beautiful, instructional, invaluable?\\" Is it just that we interpret order to be an indication of priority?    But beyond these two narrow areas, King's work is a one-of-a-kind treasure that I will return to time and time again for help and for moral support.
B001DTPZNY|2.0|I had only watched the first Indiana Jones film before watching this one, but I don't need to watch the other two originals to know that they're much better than this. The plot is really ridiculous and full of big holes, like how they let the traitor keep following them around and a zillion more that you don't have to keep an eye out for to notice. Most of the acting is ok except for Harrison Ford who is still hilarious and very entertaining even though the rest of the movie elements fail to complete the package. The story mainly ruined it, I mean a plot centered around aliens really didn't fit the series. It was way too far-fetched and loses your interest pretty fast. The visual effects are pretty much up to par and are really well done. The music is, of course, spot-on as John Williams is the composer. So overall I recommend you do NOT watch this movie. Even if you rent it for $1 at your local Safeway it's a wasted dollar and also a wasted two hours unless you just want to be entertained a bit by Harrison Ford.

0684865130|5.0|When Joseph Heller's wonderfully hilarious novel \\"Catch-22\\" was published in 1961, World War II was celebrated as the \\"good fight.\\" Popular memory held it as a noble stand against the Axis onslaught and a glorious victory for democracy, as opposed to the more recent Korean War, a somewhat muddled thing with no rousing cause beyond vague theories of \\"containment.\\" Needless to say, many found the irreverence and dark humor of \\"Catch-22\\" somewhat disturbing. Its hero, Yossarian, spends the story trying frantically to be sent home and not fly any more missions, while the United States military is depicted as an inanely irrational bureaucracy. The multifaceted \\"Catch-22\\" tells many tales, including a contemporarily relevant account of rhetoric gone wrong and the wiles of words used justify a variety of dubious causes in ways that make nonsensical sense. The result is a highly entertaining dark comedy that takes absurdity to new heights.<br /><br />\\"Catch-22\\" has often been described as the insanity of modern life as seen from the perspective of someone who is perhaps too sane. Yossarian is perturbed by the very logical fact that thousands of people whom he does not know nor has ever even met are trying desperately to kill him. Common sense would indicate that it is best to remove oneself from such a situation, especially given the basic biological instinct for survival found in all animals. However, such is the incongruous nature of war, here only heightened by the fantastically illogical organizations running it. In order for Yossarian to be properly discharged from service, he must be proven mentally unfit for combat. Unfortunately, the very act of self-preservation is indicative of a sound man. That, as Doc Daneeka explains, is the principle of Catch-22. Although he admits it has a \\"spinning reasonableness\\" and an \\"elliptical precision about its perfect pairs and parts that was graceful and shocking,\\" Yossarian remains steadfastly bound to the primordial value of life. It is later revealed that he came into his dangerously good sense after the gory death of his comrade Snowden in an air battle, thereby launching his quest to not fly any more missions. Alas, Colonel Cathcart, constantly trying to please his superiors so he can be promoted to general, persists in raising the number required. In essence, \\"Catch-22 . . . says you've always got to do what your commanding officer tells you to.\\"<br /><br />I think Yossarian's plight is perhaps that the individual must always work to oppose the domineering \\"vested interests\\" of business, government, and the military. Though vital to modern world, these establishments are often forced to rely on unscrupulous means to safeguard themselves against a populace rightfully dissatisfied with them. The core definition of Catch-22, according an old woman, is that \\"they have the right to do anything we can't stop them from doing.\\" Of course, so that they cannot be stopped, Yossarian's goal must be to prevent those in the military command from continuing to utilize him like a tool for their own ends. Yet the individual can never entirely escape the officious, overbearing, yet coldly and impersonally distant bureaucracies of contemporary society. To do so would be to violate the shifting facades of principle upon which they rest. There is too little to be certain of. Still, there remains the old declaration of skeptical philosophy: \\"I think, therefore I am,\\" as Descartes once phrased it. When the world takes on an air of unreality, when there is doubt of the very ground upon which one stands, there persists that one eternal verity: conscious life. Who wants a life, one character asks, if it is nothing but \\"a series of unfortunate events\\"? The response is another question: \\"What else is there?\\"<br /><br />When it was fist published in 1961, \\"Catch-22\\" received mixed reviews and moderate success. As the sixties continued on, however, Joseph Heller's novel took on a new significance. An entire generation was coming to question the authority under which they lived, as well as its rhetoric of black and white, good versus evil. Granted, there is little to have loved about the Communist dictatorship of the Soviet Union, although some American leftists came to believe that there was, but nor could the actions of the United States be seen as wholly in the right. President Lyndon B. Johnson subsequently found that he could not talk the public into supporting the Vietnam War with fuzzy affirmations of \\"Courage, Might, Justice, Truth, Liberty, Love, Honor, and Patriotism\\" backed by geopolitical jargon about the importance of the Third World in the liberty-or-death struggle against global Communism. In \\"Catch-22,\\" Yossarian finally decides to flee to Sweden: since the war is almost over, he would be risking his life for nothing but Colonel Cathcart's clamoring to be general. Meanwhile, in the real world, \\"Yossarian Lives!\\" would become a popular anti-Vietnam slogan. Escape was not an option for millions of young Americans in the late sixties who began to take \\"Catch-22\\" seriously and help make it into the classic it is today.n the authority under which they lived, as well as its rhetoric of black and white, good versus evil.

Yummy.<br /><br />The better aspects of this film:  What would you do with a historic figure?  Would you tell him all about his future exploits?  Or when you find out he likes to drink moonshine, '60s rock, and only invented Warp Drive for the money, what would you think of him then?  Kinda like finding out George Washington had black slaves, that kinda thing.<br /><br />Deanna Troy getting tipsy was fun; Data apparently being lured by the Dark Side (sex); and Picard's obsession with the Borg being in line with Melville's obsession with Moby Dick (plus a quote from the book).<br /><br />Nice direction from Frakes and a good way to wrap up the Next Gen.<br /><br />The second DVD has various Trekkie things, such as Jerry Goldsmith tribute.  Gosh, I had no idea he did the music for Voyager, Star Trek The Motion Picture, and ALIEN.  WOW....<br /><br />What else you should beam up to your Wish List, Scotty:<br /><br />[[ASIN:6305910189 Star Trek II - The Wrath of Khan]]<br />[[ASIN:B000A6T262 Star Trek Movie Set (The Motion Picture/ The Wrath of Khan/ The Search for Spock/ The Voyage Home/ The Final Frontier/ The Undiscovered Country/ Generations/ First Contact/ Insurrection/ Nemesis)]]<br />[[ASIN:B00005JLRT Star Trek - Nemesis (Widescreen Edition)]]
B001ECE6C6|4.0|Having already owned the original Polish recording for over three years & been at times enraptured & at others left cold by it, I'm not at all surprised at the diversity of reviewers' opinions here.  Let me explain.  Firstly, there's absolutely nothing wrong with the concept of this album (ie. adding words & vocals to some of Metheny/Mays' best tunes), nothing at all wrong with Jopek's voice (light yet appealingly smoky) &, in the main, nothing wrong with Pat's new arrangements (mainly just voice, guitar, piano, bass & drums with occasional synth).  Indeed, from the opening Picasso guitar playing of \\"Cichy Zapada Zmrok\\" a FIRST listen invariably pleases. However, from track 2 \\"Mania Mienia\\" (\\"So May It Secretly Begin\\") a slightly unsettling phenomenon starts to occur - on first blush you can't help but think that the tune is \\"meant\\" to have words yet it seems that as the arrangement gets ever so slightly more embellished (in this particular case a little bit of backing violin & some overdubbed vocals) you start yearning to hit the eject button & replace it with the original version from \\"Still Life Talking\\".  Same with \\"Przypeyw Oddech Czasu\\" (Tell Her You Saw Me) where the almost \\"plodding\\" vocals plus a little too trilling piano & then a faux South American pan-pipe & conga effect had me almost gagging on one listen & again yearning & reaching for the original from \\"Secret Story\\".  Same again with \\"Tam Gdzie Nie Siega Wzrok\\" (Follow Me) where there's simply FAR too much vocalising which diminishes the raw \\"punch\\" of the original version (I know everything's a matter of taste but IMHO the vocalese voice-over of the \\"bridge\\" part which continues as a backing vocal through to the end of the track is frankly awful!).  So, here's the rub - these are such great tunes that adding a new dimension (ie. vocals sung by quite an appealing singer) seems like a great idea & on first listen you're happy enough to give the new arrangements their \\"head\\", so to speak.  However, after a while you get the sense that some of the arrangements have been ever so slightly overdone & maybe the original versions are the better ones after all.  So, this is a 3.5-4 star disc because:-  on the plus side, the tunes ARE fantastic (worthy of at least 4* on their own) & at times the arrangements are indeed new & fresh & add a new dimension to Metheny's greatness;  on the minus side, there's often a bit too much singing/not enough guitar & occasionally over-wrought arrangements which make the originals seem just fine as they were.
630469878X|1.0|To describe this movie as feminist is ridiculous. The female leads don't use their heads, operate on pure and unchecked emotion (mostly fear-based), seem to feel alive only when they're exhibiting the same level of violence that the cartoon-character-evil-men they cross paths with have exhibited towards them, and finally \\"triumph\\" by committing suicide, albeit in a \\"romantic\\" fashion by driving their convertible, top-down, over a cliff at the Grand Canyon while they clasp hands in hysterical \\"sisterhood.\\"<br /><br />Give me a f^%$#&^g break here, people. Feminisim is about responsibility every bit as much as it's about freedom. I don't know about your world, but in mine it's necessary to have a functioning brain, to be capable of rational thought and right action, to know when to ask for help and when to give it, and to be able to exercise some impulse control and deal effectively with unfair and sometimes even abusive treatment. Because it's not a perfect world. Not for men, and not for women. Deal.<br /><br />OK, the movie seems to posit that these two - especially the Geena Davis character - are so incapacitated due to the abuse they've suffered that they're not capable of any of that. Gee, sounds like the excuse often given by male murderers and rapists for the horrible things they do. And it just doesn't wash.<br /><br />Feminism does not equal intellectual vacuity and man-hating - although to accuse this film of man hating seems laughable. There are hardly any \\"men\\" in it, just stereotypes of men who exist merely to give the female leads an excuse to dig themselves an ever-deeper hole of violence and idiocy leading to suicide.<br /><br />Yes, suicide. Death. That's triumph? That's a feminist statement? Not in my book.<br /><br />This movie isn't man-hating because there aren't any men in it, only cartoon characters. But it IS woman-hating because it never even entertains the possibility that women who've been treated with violence and gross unfairness, women who've had their humanity stifled, might still truly triumph by undertaking the mostly interior, unglamorous fight for their own humanity and might truly win by living out life - yes, LIVING it out - on their own terms: creatively, lovingly, intelligenty, compassionately, productively, with self-awareness, as adults, in this imperfect world. That's real strength, and that's real feminism. The two-hour-long temper-tantrum the female leads in this movie engage in is not.<br /><br />This movie panders to spoiled, gutless American women who enjoy their \\"victim\\" role and who refuse to do the work of taking responsibility for their own lives, as adults, in one of the richest countries on earth. I suggest these women go to a place like Somalia and see what the women there have to deal with daily, and then come back and see if they still see a self-indulgent, self-pitying, mindless movie like this one in quite the same way.t still truly triumph by undertaking the mostly interior, unglamorous fight for their own humanity and might truly win by living out life - yes, LIVING it out - on their own terms: creatively, lovingly, intelligenty, compassionately, productively, with self-awareness, as adults, in this imperfect world.

156224003X|5.0|I have to admit that after first reading the book and trying the meditations, I did not fully appreciate what all the 5-star reviews here at Amazon were going on about. My first reaction was \\"Yea, some of this is useful (though not new) and yea, maybe the meditations could be useful, but this cat really is over the top.\\" Some of the self-empowering parts of the meditations seem corny and unconvincing.<br /><br />HOWEVER, after a little time (few months) passed, I find myself using parts of the meditations and without thinking about it, my playing is becoming more and more relaxed, more natural, and simply more fun! Other musicians that have heard me (and are not even aware of the book) have made comments like \\"What the ***** have you been practicing? You have a new instructor? WHERE THE HECK DID YOU LEARN HOW TO PLAY LIKE THAT?!\\" I have been floored by others' reactions. They seem to pick up on the improvements that I apparently have made even more that I do.<br /><br />People will notice!<br /><br />The title is a little misleading (IMHO) because it is not \\"effortless.\\" You DO have to read the book and follow his directions. At least adopt what works for YOU. The place you will first feel that things are just different is in your practice. Focus improves, you learn more in less time, you just seem to naturally start seeing what you need to work on. There is the key word \\"work\\"... You DO still have to work on your music and practice, but this book will give you a subtle edge... I can't even really put a finger on it. I can tell you that it is clearly \\"Liberating\\" though, as indicated in the subtitle.<br /><br />It worked for me. It will probably work for you as well. I have read a number of books like this one and Werner knows what he is talking about. Give it a try!<br /><br />RHB
B000255LIY|5.0|Any depiction of The Lion in Winter must inevitably be compared with the magnificent 1968 production starring Peter O'Toole and Katherine Hepburn.  This version starring Patrick Stewart and Glenn Close has some  significant departures from the 1969 gold standard, but nevertheless manages to be a superb dramatization in its own right.<br /><br />Its Christmas, 1183, and King Henry II of England has called his family together for a happy holiday season. The problem is, he has his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine in prison, and she and their three sons Richard, Geoffrey, and John, are all thirsting for power.  The King is growing old (he was to die in 1187) and he wants his youngest son John to succeed him.  Eleanor's favorite is their oldest son Richard, while the middle boy Geoffrey is biding his time and waiting for his chance.  Adding to the complications is the presence of Princess Alais of France, who was supposed to marry Richard but who has become King Henry's mistress, and her brother King Philip of France, 18 years old but already a master of intrigue and deceit.<br /><br />While this version lacks some of the fabulous chemistry and sparkle provided by O'Toole and Hepburn, it makes up for it by the deeper, more somber interaction of Stewart and Close.  This version doesn't make me laugh as much as the 1968 version does, but it definitely has an even deeper sense of gravitas and irony.  Both dramatizations are superb, and my advice is to buy both and watch them on successive nights.
0156907399|5.0|After reading some lighter fiction, I decided to delve into something deeper, a novel by Virginia Woolf. I located the tattered copy from my school days and took a deep breath. Here is another phenomenal book by Virginia Woolf. Published in 1927, To the Lighthouse broke new ground and Virginia Woolf emerged as the chief figure of modernism--and perhaps feminism--in England.<br /><br />The book begins as Mrs. Ramsay, mother to eight children, speaks to her youngest child, James, age six, about his wish to go to the Lighthouse on the following day:<br /><br />\\"Yes, of course, if it's fine tomorrow,\\" said Mrs. Ramsay. \\"But you'll have to be up with the lark\\", she added.<br />To her son these words conveyed an extraordinary joy, as if it were settled, the expedition bound to take place, and the wonder to which he looked forward to, for years and years it seemed, was, after a night's darkness and a day's sail, within touch.<br />~To the Lighthouse, Virginia Woolf<br /><br />However, Mr. Ramsay, as well as Charles Tansley, soon shatter the boy's hopes by saying that it will rain the next day, and that a trip to the Lighthouse is out of the question, which upsets both James and his devoted mother greatly. The setting for the story begins at the summer house at the Isle of the Skye during the summer, where the Ramsays entertain numerous friends in addition to their large family. Mrs. Ramsay tries to soothe the boy by saying that the weather may be fine, because she has a far greater understanding of her sensitive, gifted child than either her husband or his friend. Keenly aware of the beauty and brevity of childhood, she wants her children to be happy and hopeful, to be filled with light, in a world with ample darkness. The novel focuses on the intensity of childhood emotions, and highlights the impermanence of adult relationships and the transient nature of everything. The issue of the trip to the Lighthouse is brought up time and time again in the first section of To the Lighthouse, The Window, in which through repetition and stream-of-consciousness writing (Virginia Woolf's trademark style), the interior monologues of various characters are presented, seizing fleeting moods, feelings, thoughts, and insecurities, and the transient nature of things and relationships, giving permanence to these moments in the book, making them immortal--which seems to have been the author's goal. Like our own thoughts, which are often repetitious (and dare I say dull at times), the characters seem to tire of their own cyclical thoughts. At other times, their disjointed thoughts are featured. Virginia Woolf captures the dual reality of thought in To The Lighthouse, thought which is alternatively repetitive and disconnected. (Think about your own thinking--isn't it also this way?)<br /><br />Just as in the story the painter Lily Briscoe tries to capture beautiful Mrs. Ramsay in a painting (although Lily is scoffed at, and the male belief was that women could neither paint nor write) the book attempts to make the impermanent permanent, and portrays these fleeting moments brilliantly, especially those between husband and wife. This is Virginia's Woolf's most autobiographical novel, and her husband, Leonard Woolf, called it a masterpiece. Virginia Woolf broke from tradition in this three part book, a novel in which there's not much action or dialogue, but instead much thought, about the ordinary as well as about time and the fleeting nature of life. One of the book's main themes is the ubiquity of transience. Is there an antidote for this often disturbing transience? Virginia Woolf suggests to women that while family and human relationships are important (although difficult sometimes), creative work may hold the key--meaningful work that will engage and may even outlive us. In this way, transience may be transcended to some degree.<br /><br />(This review is from my blog about books, Suko's Notebook, suko95.blogspot.com.)through repetition and stream-of-consciousness writing (Virginia Woolf's trademark style), the interior monologues of various characters are presented, seizing fleeting moods, feelings, thoughts, and insecurities, and the transient nature of things and relationships, giving permanence to these moments in the book, making them immortal--which seems to have been the author's goal.

0956010903|5.0|This is an absolute must have collectors piece  for any Harry Potter fan. The Tales of Beedle the Bard, Collector's Edition is strikingly beautiful. The craftsmanship amazing. You will not be disappointed. This gorgeous item of potterbilia is well worth the price. Wow!
B0010X8NF0|5.0|Probably one of the better questions asked on this journey.  Wes Anderson takes the audience on yet another humorous voyage of discovery aboard the Darjeeling Limited, but not without a little misdirection first.  Just when you think this is going to be another movie with Bill Murray, Adrien Brody overtakes the \\"businessman\\" on the railway platform and leaps aboard the departing train, joining his brothers in a first class cabin where they are treated to sweet limes by the lovely Rita.<br /><br />Anderson returns to an early format, Bottle Rocket, in setting up this spiritual journey led by the intrepid Owen Wilson.  Jason Schwartzman, who gets writing credits this time around, fills out the trio.  The movie drifts along at the pace you would expect from Anderson, less a travelogue of India than it is a clever study on fraternal relations.  We do get a spicy taste of India, replete with a splendid array of colors and a very touching sequence of events in an Indian village, not to mention another fun soundtrack drawing on the Kinks, Stones and even Joe Dassin.  The brothers finally do seem to reforge their bond, with an ironic wink.<br /><br />The DVD includes the all important \\"Hotel Chevalier,\\" cast in warm yellow tones, that is referred to throughout the film, underscored by Peter Sarstedt's wonderful \\"Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)\\".  It provides important clues to Schwartzman's character and features a fetching Natalie Portman as Jack's girlfriend.  See it first.
B000000W5L|3.0|The best Stones album is \\"Let It Bleed\\".  My favourite Stones albums are \\"Goats Head Soup\\" and \\"Decembers Children\\". Exile is a bunch of tracks scraped from the bottom of the barrel and recorded in dysfunctional chaose at Keith's Heroin House in the South of France in the Summer of 1971.  I love the Stones, but this is so far below their standard.
B001ED7C58|4.0|I say that this is a clever mix of tracks in that it a) introduced me to great new music, b) totally set the tone for the movie and c) fit into the movie where it'd least expect it.<br /><br />As I've read in other reviews, a lot of customers are confused, saying the Iron & Wine song is out of place, yet that the whole soundtrack doesn't ring purely to the Edward & Isabella romance. Yet, the very ending scene with them at prom night IS! Iron & Wine's Flightless Bird, American Mouth!<br /><br />Other great tracks worth noting:<br />- The Black Ghosts' Full Moon. Trance, acoustic, played during the intro/ Bella's trip from Arizona to Forks. Completely addictive. I play this everyday since I've watched Twilight. Ambient feel with lyrics/melody.<br /><br />- Perry Farrell's Going All The Way [Into The Twilight], the dance beat number that played during the prom scene. A little bit far on the poppy side, but definitely fit for the scene; it replays in my mind every time it comes on.<br /><br />- Supermassive Black Hole by Muse, featured during the intense baseball scene. Really got me pumped, and Muse always delivers.<br /><br />- The ending credit songs: 15 Step by Radiohead (although obviously not to be featured on the album on account it's, hey, Radiohead), Decode by Paramore, and Linkin Park's Leave Out All The Rest.<br /><br />- Also... Rob Pattinson, whose featured song 'Never Think' is on the Twilight soundtrack is gorgeous. Ladies, he models, acts, AND is a musician. His song is a beautiful acoustic melody, emotional in every word, down to the deep chortles of his soft, romantic voice; completely surprising. I find myself imagining our EDWARD Cullen sing in such a mature and alluring way! Unbelievable. Definitely a folk song.<br /><br />Twilight is definitely a generational steeple in teen flicks, with a soundtrack to match the times. It's soundtrack helped expose me to a lot of great artists (whose songs from the soundtrack are, without a doubt, on my profile playlist on MySpace).<br /><br />I'd say it's worth checking out the songs you like from the soundtrack on an online playlist such as [...], Music and getting a feel for/play them there; save some money like me. Or, if you wanna support this film and the economy, purchase it. However, everyone I know's getting this soundtrack that I doubt it'll be hard to rip it off someone; let's be real. And, it being of various artists, I'd definitely encourage it. It is a great pop soundtrack, but if you only like a few of the songs, it can definitely turn into a hit & miss!songs you like from the soundtrack on an online playlist such as [...], Music and getting a feel for/play them there; save some money like me.

0316017922|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell has done it again.  This book is incredibly fascinating.  It's like Malcolm Gladwell has X-ray vision and can see things about life that no one else sees. But when you read it, you say to yourself: \\"This is so true.  Why didn't I figure this out earlier?\\"      Name any field in which certain people stand out \\"head and shoulders\\" above the rest.  Gladwell explodes the myth of the self-made man or woman, and explains that hidden advantages and just plain luck  play a big role in some people being really successful. No one succeeds alone.     The person or group must work hard, and have a certain baseline of talent,  but the term \\"lucky break\\" takes on a new meaning after reading this book. Would anyone other than Gladwell suggest that the Beatles were lucky and not just talented?     This is a great read---like eating a stack of candy bars or watching a great movie.      I once heard Garth Brooks say: \\"I know there are people walking the streets of Nashville who can sing better than me,\\" but I never understood what he meant until now.  Some people make it, some don't.  One thing is for sure: only hard work puts you in a position to benefit from good fortune.
0956010903|5.0|After a lot of hectic customer service phone calls, I finally received my copy.  I've been rather ecstatic about this little piece of literature since before it was announced (having been disappointed at the fact I may never read these tales), and now I have my own copy in hand!    Firstly, I'll touch briefly on the craftsmanship of the book.  It simply exceeded my expectations.  The quality is astounding and absolutely gorgeous.  While it wasn't worth the $100, I have to say it was well worth the feeling that I contributed to helping make a child's life just that much better.  Any amount of money is worth that.  I bought a standard version earlier this morning just to read the tales before my collector's edition came in.  Both are wonderful!    Secondly, I'd like to speak about the tales.  J.K. Rowling delivered an absolutely stunning piece of work (this, of course, does not surprise me, having been a fan of this book series since I was a fifth grader).  Since obtaining both copies, I've read the tales twice apiece, never wanting to put it down to do my final exam papers.  Each tale is chock full with good, bad, and morality in general.  These tales are all enjoyable to children and adults alike.  I must say, my personal favorites are \\"The Warlock's Hairy Heart\\" and \\"The Fountain of Fair Fortune.\\"    Overall, I'd definitely suggest a fan pick this wonderful addition to the Harry Potter universe.  It definitely pays itself off in its re-read value.  However, if you can't afford the fancy edition, by all means go with the cheaper of the two and still enjoy these fantastic tales!    Also as a side note: it may be best to pick up a copy of \\"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\\" if you want to understand some of the terminology used in a couple of Dumbledore's commentaries!
B001C46P2A|3.0|AUSTRALIA is a big, old-fashioned kind of epic that manages to entertain mildly on a very broad scale.  It's the kind of movie that made me think upon its conclusion, \\"I liked it okay...but it's also a little weird and pointless that so much time and effort was put into such a ho-hum movie.\\"    I think part of the problem is that much of the film is trying to illuminate Australia's recent history of very ill treatment of \\"mixed race\\" aborigines.  Apparently, as World War II was nearing the country, there was a policy in place to round up these \\"half breed\\" children and separate them from their tribal roots...I guess to keep white genes out of the aboriginal gene pool.  Naturally, this is an outrageous policy that had terrible consequences.  It's the kind of thing that probably still leaves Australians today with bad feelings.  But in the movie AUSTRALIA, no true sense of outrage is achieved.  We feel bad for the characters who endure this racism, but it all feels kind of quaint, too.  We can \\"tut-tut\\" to ourselves about how bad things used to be...but the film is not exactly a call to action.    Frankly, the unsurpassed epic GONE WITH THE WIND stirs more outrage about the plight of enslaved African-Americans simply by NOT making an issue of their treatment.  To watch that film today, and to see the casual treatment of blacks as inferior is far more chilling (even though it wasn't deliberate).     Anyway, AUSTRALIA primarily concerns the rich English lady played by Nicole Kidman, who travels to Australia more or less in a fit of pique to check up on her errant husband and his cattle business.  She arrives to find that her husband has just died (perhaps in suspicious circumstances) and she is suddenly somewhat responsible for the ranch, the cattle and her husband's employees.  As all women in epics of this kind do, she decides she can learn this business and drive her cattle to town, just through sheer spunk.  She enlists Hugh Jackman (a cattle drover whose name alsoappears to be Mr. Drover) to lead the way.  And this earthy, ill-mannered man who has little use for women with spunk eventually gives in, and wouldn't you know it, the two even manage to fall passionately in love.    If I sound a little cynical in my tone, it's because virtually  nothing in the film comes as a surprise.  Will Kidman decide she has the right to be a rancher?  Will their cattle drive succeed in getting the cows into town ahead of  the mean, underhanded cattle tycoon (Bryan Brown) and HIS herd?  Will Kidman and Jackman fall in love?  Will they have many misadventures?  Will they both take a liking to the irrepressibly cute \\"half breed\\" child whose mother works on their staff?  Will they \\"adopt\\" him when his mother dies?      What makes the film work to any extent at all is that some of these dramatic archetypes (i.e. clichés) still work.  The \\"cattle-drive against the odds\\" is as old as movies themselves...yet there is still something amazingly effective about them.  The stampedes, the chance to get to see the noble side of all your main characters.  The chance to see some magnificent countryside.  It just flat out works.  There are some quite powerful scenes during this segment, which is easily the best chunk of the film.    Later, WWII does strike the coastal town of Darwin, and Kidman, Jackman and the young boy are all imperiled and separated.  Daring rescues are needed.  The bad guys make things needlessly difficult, etc.  The town of Darwin is largely computer generated and the battle scenes are short and feel very, very uninspired.  These should be some of the climactic moments of the film...but they never really generate any significant suspense.    The film also plays around a bit with the \\"magic\\" of an aboriginal elder, the boy's grandfather.  He wants to boy to go with him on a walkabout...taking the first steps to manhood.  The boy is torn between his desire to follow his seemingly all-knowing grandfather...but he also wants to live with Kidman and Jackman and enjoy the \\"easy\\" lifestyle of these civilized folks.  This dilemma, I think, is supposed to help illuminate the greater themes of the film as a discussion of Australia's systematic racism.  In reality, though, I would say that it simply suggests that a harmony could be reached for these \\"half breeds\\"...one that values both backgrounds, and thus should be an OPPORTUNITY for succeeding in both worlds, rather be an outcast from both.      The film is directed by Baz Luhrman, and I want to say right here and how that I am not a Luhrman fan.  I found MOULIN ROUGE to be almost unbearable to watch.  The endlessly droning, badly sung love songs.  The total lack of real chemistry between Ewan McGregor and Kidman.  The fantastical scenery that felt more and more like a Disneyland knockoff.      AUSTRALIA is certainly better...but it suffers from some similar problems.  Kidman and Jackman do a great job of playing as though they are in love and have the hots for each other.  They stare into each other's eyes a lot.  Jackman frequently crushes Kidman to his chest, just like on the cover of a bodice ripper.  They kiss with great fervor.  And yet I never once felt connected to their relationship.  I always like Jackman's easy demeanor...he seems like an amiable kind of fellow, and it's nice to see him working in his \\"native\\" Australian.  Kidman is a cold actress (and greatly over-rated)...but she does manage to evoke some laughs and some convincing spunkiness.  Yet as so often happens with her, she is unconvincing as a woman in love.  And to me, her two most unconvincing romantic efforts to date have been 1) MOULIN ROUGE & 2) AUSTRALIA.  She may love working with Baz Luhrman...but doing so isn't helping her.    If you see AUSTRALIA, chances are that you'll be entertained for its nearly 3 hour length.  But its impact on you will be brief and modest.
B001GEL1NO|1.0|For the first time ever I will NOT buy the new Chris Cornell record.  This and the other two new singles are AWFUL!  Someone should tie him down and make him listed to early Soundgarden.  He needs to return to his roots and give us some hard rock!  This does not work!

B001782N4A|1.0|I bought one of these from AbcToy4me - they used the same description referring to the \\"spinning dome\\" feature.    This version is from the UK and does not have a spinning dome/head. Only the version imported from Japan has this feature (and also has color changing LED's in the holo-emitter).    Also, the two USB ports on the rear are fowled by the legs when R2 leans back. This means that you cannot use them for a BlueTooth adapter or USB flash drive.    While the details are fairly accurate, the mould quality isn't great. On the one I had, there were four seams in the silver portion of the dome (meaning that each quarter of the mould was not well lined up with the next when the plastic was injected in).    I returned mine because it did not work as described. If it were $20 I would rate it higher, but for just a static USB hub that beeps, it is too expensive.    PS: Abctoy4me did not reply to any of my emails, so I sent it back using Delivery Confirmation. They received it but still haven't credited it back to my credit card. Mailing it back to them cost me another $9.70, which I am out of pocket for - all because of an incorrect product description.
B0018AK9RA|5.0|I've only become a Judas Priest fan in the last two years or so, but have listened (at some point) to all of their songs and learned about their history, influences, and so on. When I first heard of this album, I was reminded of a scene in the movie Spinal Tap where the band starts talking about \\"returning to that concept album about Jack the Ripper,\\" except here it's \\"Nostradamus.\\" When I heard about the rampant synths and keyboards, my skepticism rose further. I imagined a pretentious album with Casio-like synths, over-the-top lyrics, and aspirations to opera.    Wrong!     While this album isn't as classic as Stained Class or as raw as Angel of Retribution, I still enjoyed it immensely and appreciate the scope of the thing. It may be a little cheesy at times, but the synths tend more to complement the vocals and guitar work than distract or substitute for it, and the lyrics are excellent. Halford really seems to have channeled Nostradamus here an gives us a very moving and potent view of this man's life and painful struggles as a seer of the future. We might think \\"Oh, yeah, it'd be cool to see the future,\\" but this album shows that this can be a curse. The lyrics and Halford's masterfully emotive vocals are enough to bring tears, and even the hard-biting parts are less about head-banging and more about desperation or indignation than hate or revenge.     It's a bit difficult to pick out individual songs here, since this is really case of \\"the whole being greater than the parts,\\" but a few songs did stand out. My favorite is \\"Alone,\\" which features a great chorus, lyrics, and great acoustic and electric guitar. This is followed by \\"Shadows in the Flame,\\" a very short and much softer song that just flows on air. Beautiful stuff. \\"Future of Mankind\\" is great, too, a long song that fans of \\"Lochness\\" may appreciate for its length and sophistication.     \\"Prophecy\\" is a rocking tune that sets up the story of the proud psychic who's about to find his life going downhill (as you'll hear in the next song, \\"Revelations.\\") The song \\"Nostradamus\\" is similarly heavy. The climax seems to be \\"Pestilence and Plague,\\" which definitely sounds the most operatic of all the songs here. There's also some interesting moments in \\"Conquest\\" that sound almost Eastern. \\"Lost Love,\\" if you'll forgive me, reminded me occasionally of Air Supply. \\"Persecution\\" is definitely worth a listen; I love the sounds at the opening and close, and the solos are flying.     All in all, I liked the album, though it might be best described as \\"Judas Priest meets Ayreon.\\" It's not for everyone, but if you're looking for a more ambitious Priest album and don't mind the synths, you won't be disappointed with this album.
0756633311|5.0|I finally read P and P when I assigned it to my sixteen year old daughter.  She really appreciated the little notes in the DK illustrated classics edition.  I have been reading older novels for so long I didn't really take too much note of the explanations since they were all familiar to me but my daughter said they really helped her understand some things that were very unclear to her and keep her momentem reading the novel, which we both really loved.
B001KPR5L6|4.0|I can't stop myself from humming these songs to myself all day at work - and for a hard-bitten engineer, that's saying a lot.  There's a few songs that don't work but the others more than make up for it.  Highly recommended.
B000V86OKG|5.0|My husband and I both love Dexter.  We just finished watching the 2nd season and can't wait for the 3rd to come out.  I recommend this series to anyone who enjoys shows with a twist.
B00004Y6NV|5.0|\\"It's your face I'm looking for, on every street\\".<br />Is it just me or is this one of most poignant lyrics ever written?<br /><br />For me, On Every Street is a bonafide masterpiece, full of achingly beautiful, transcendent, evocative, lovingly created lyrics and music, all underscored by one of our most amazingly talented and tasteful guitarists. The greatness of a block of these tunes: Calling Elvis, On Every Street, When It Comes To You, Fade to Black, The Bug, You and Your Friend, Heavy Fuel, Iron Hand, Planet of New Orleans, is nonpareil.<br /><br />Knopfler has never been better than this. These magnificent songs run the gamut of human emotions. An album for the ages, full of laughter, sadness, longing, irony, grace, and spontaneity.<br /><br />The greatness of Mark Knopfler lies in the humility of his approach: he believes in the subtle power of the silence between the notes, the quiet thought, the murmur. He does not shout, doesn't demand to be heard, but speaks softly, with incredible clarity, skill and eloquence. Thus the impact of his work is magnified. We hear that voice, that guitar, those songs, and we think: this is someone to listen to. This is what has always set him apart: supernatural chops, but he's not about to show off to the point that the music, the song, the feeling, comes second.

0552998486|1.0|I was quite disappointed by the characters in this book. If people really see \\"church-goers\\" as hateful and snobbish as the author portrays then they're hanging out with the wrong Christians. So I entitled my review \\"Don't Waste Your Time\\". The priest gorges himself on chocolate, the \\"heroine\\" is impregnated by the local gypsy, and everyone lives happily ever after.
B001GQO50I|1.0|Yes, just as everyone else has said, the quality is bad compared to recently published snippets of the original master tapes...   The Doors could have made this one of the best and most important releases  (which it rightly should have been!) of their career but instead dropped the ball.     They should be ashamed of themselves releasing this after so many homeruns in the Bright Midnight Archive Series!!
B000Q67876|5.0|I could watch this movie 100 times over and not get tired of it. I loved it.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|One of my favorite Xmas movies of all time. I get slightly teary at the end. The music is beautiful and almost haunting in a way.     But just a heads up, it states that David Bowie is featured in this version and he is not. Apparently there is a version of The Snowman where David Bowie provides an introduction (A friend of mine who used to watch this in the UK told me this).     If you want to version with the David Bowie intro, do not buy this version. You might want to try Amazon UK.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This is a great little flash for my nikon D-40.  fast power up, can tilt the flash for bounce effect....for 10 ft ceiling or less...great image.  For normal picture taking, lighting is one of the most important aspect and this product does it when natural light is not there.
B0015D3YX6|5.0|If you purchased the 2001 reissue of this 60's masterpiece and think that one will do, forget it! This is what is meant by a \\"Collector's Edition\\". The second disc is worth the price of admission alone. The instrumental, unorchestrated versions of some of the original tracks are incredible. Sound quality is top notch and new booklet looks gorgeous.<br />One minor gripe- the booklet, which includes information up to Arthur Lee's recent death, is thinner than the 2001 booklet. Don't let that prevent you from purchasing  this version.
B000ILYYJE|4.0|For those who do not have a complete set of remastered Doors studio albums, this set is probably worth it if you find it at the right price (don't pay the full price).  Packaging is creative, booklets are well written and the digipacks themselves are sturdy and well-designed.  Two minor gripes, however: (a) the 5.1 surround mixes make much less use of the back channels than other relatively recent 5.1 releases, e,g., Queen \\"Night at the Opera\\", or anything from the 3 Genesis retrospective box sets - however, I do consider the source here; (b) it would have been nice if the set had included a live disc of some sort.  That's it, otherwise - overall, I'd recommend this.
B000WTZ784|4.0|As I am sure a number of reviewers have pointed out one has to give Genesis credit for plugging away into the 1990's even after,again losing yet another lead vocalist. On the other hand I had no clue this album even existed until this point. And I must admit it speaking strictly in terms of material this album actually is a lot more interesting in many ways from [[ASIN:B000WTZ78Y We Can't Dance]],the bands final album with Phil Collins. The music presented here basically melds elements of 90's alternative rock with Genesis's classic sound.But really the overall sound,again doesn't deviate much from the Genesis/Mike+The Mechanics sound of the mid to late 1980's.Many of these songs are quite good-the memorable \\"Shipwrecked\\" (a deserved hit) and songs like \\"Alien Afternoon\\" and \\"If That's What You Need\\" which show the band hasn't lost it's progressive chops one bit.Drummers Nir Zidkyahu and Nick D.Virgilio don't sounds a lot like Phil Collins but they certainly make their mark-taking inventive turns with the exception of the last song \\"One Man's Fool\\",which almost qualifies as a Phil Collin's ripoff in the drumming department. The alternative rock side of it isn't strong in the instrumental area even though some songs have harsher guitars now and then but they come mostly in the lead vocals of Ray Wilson. For 1997 I suppose he thought a good way to maintain Genesis's commercial integrity. But fact is he kind of sounds like a lot of other alt-rock vocalists of the era-breathy,distant and lacking in vocal range. But I find it interesting how Ray's more contemporary singing style blends with Genesis's sound,which truthfully is still very similar to their 80's \\"proggy pop/rock\\" style. Truth is though alternative rock singing was never my personal favorite vocal style in the world (largely as I was OD'd on it from radio in this era) but this album is full of music that is quite strong and,to be honest I bet if Phil Collins (or even Peter Gabriel) sang on this album it's commercial fate would surely have been better.But somehow I don't think it's over for Genesis as a studio band.We'll all just have to see.commercial fate would surely have been better.But somehow I don't think it's over for Genesis as a studio band.We'll all just have to see.

0671799320|5.0|This is the standard.  Michael Yergin, now the CEO of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, in 1991 wrote this tomb which is the defacto standard text and reference for anyone interested in reading about the history of oil.<br /><br />This is a meticulously researched book which chronicles the rise of oil from Pennsylvania through the present.  Yergin weaves a comprehensive chronological narrative of how the modern oil industry came into existence.  This work from Michael Yergin won the Pulitzer Prize to boot.<br /><br />There are numerous books on oil.  Many focus on peak oil.  Some focus on the tyranny or how the industry is downright evil.  This book though is all about the facts.  College history professors could use this book.  It presents the facts and the history and lets the reader reach any conclusions they want.<br /><br />Beware though, this is not light reading.  Sometimes it reads very fast and sometimes you muddle through it depending on what aspect of the oil industry you're interested in.<br /><br />After studying this work the reader will be able to intelligently speak about the history of oil and see through many of the shallower and erroneous assumptions people make about the industry.<br /><br />If you have to buy 1 and only 1 book on oil.  Get The Prize by Yergin.
0156034026|3.0|The title of this book is an eye-grabber.  When I saw it on the table at my local bookstore, I knew I was eventually going to read it.  When friends of mine raved about this book, and I saw it reduced on Amazon, I finally got it.  All-in-all, a pretty so-so story.    On the plus side, The Reluctant Fundamentalist is an easy story to digest; there's a subtle, lightweight element of thriller to it which you see from the beginning, and comes to the fore in the last 30 pages; the characters don't play to stereotypes.      Unfortunately we never really get inside the narrator's head to understand what \\"fundamentalist\\" means for the main character.  The narrator had every advantage America offers self-starters, yet he inexplicably delights in the 9/11 attacks, and develops hatred towards the country because of the attacks on Afghanistan. The rationale offered for his beliefs are vague and thin.  I never see the issue from the narrator's point of view, nor do I recoil at his behavior.    The Reluctant Fundamentalist looked good on the shelf, but didn't deliver.
0451529065|1.0|This book is a very interesting work of fiction. Its too bad that so many people take it seriously, though. Darwin had a great imagination, but with no scientific evidence to support it, its just a fable. I can't believe people are so gullible as to believe the things written in here. I'm judging it as a work of fiction. Its imaginative, but its lacking. One star.
0545128285|2.0|This much like the previous 2 \\"reference\\" books on Quidditch and Magical Creatures. If you are a Potter maniac no doubt you have multiple copies of this ordered already. The proceeds are for charity so that is great but this isn't a novel at all and the short stories are contrived and fairly trivial. If you took this out from the Potter universe I doubt any publisher would bother to publish it at all. I am sure JK was really only involved due to the nature of the charity which is good & noble of her.    If you buy this its for (a) eeking out every last bit of official Potter history possible or (b) a coffee table book or (c) meh why not. I have read all the Potter books and there was little of that magic here. Its just some short stories vaguely connected to the Potter metaverse.
0956010903|5.0|I am a 60 year old child in the world of Harry Potter.  I have absolutely loved this series since it's beginning. (I've read the series 8 times cover to cover, seriously) I would really love to have the missing 19 years in book 7 to come alive even though there is no threat anymore just to read more Harry Potter.  I bought a \\"Chocolate Frog\\" and got SNAPE but I'd loved to have gotten Dumbledore as it is referred in book one.  Now I have been given the oportunity to get Beedle the Bard and could not resist-even knowing the real fortune in ownership lies not with the original 100,000 Amazon copies but with the ORIGINAL 7 from J.K.R.  But alas I am a muggle and will hold my copy of the Collectors Edition to pass on to my heirs along with the first editions of all 7 books.  AND SO WILL YOU!!!!!  WE are apart of this history too!!!!  In future years there will be no first editions of any of this except OURS.  We have lived through all of J.K. Rowling's imagination as a story teller and have become more complete because of it. WE are apart of the Harry Potter history too!!!    When I opened my Amazon box of the Collectors Edition and searched inside I felt like Hermione Granger with her love of books. I'll let you know I've been abit around the world in my time and found and purchased a copy of a second edition of Collodi's \\"Pinocchio\\" (for 25 cents no less and found it to be a very informative read apart from the Disney version.)  Although not a 'rare' item I feel OUR first edition copy of Beedle the Bard will become regarded as will all first editions of the Harry Potter series as 'collectable' in the least if not downright priceless in let's say 4012???  So be it.  Now I have Beedle the Bard Ha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0545128285|5.0|If you love the Harry Potter series, then this is a must-have. It arrived in the mail yesterday, and I devoured it right away. And that's my only complaint: it's brevity. It's a short, quick read. But a fun one.  And it's not simply a handful of fairy tales from the wizarding world. The commentary by Albus Dumbledore on each story was a really nice touch, in some cases even more entertaining to me than the stories themselves.  If you were expecting a thick book that would absorb you for hours as the Harry Potter series did, I hope you're not disappointed in this book's brevity. It's still worth the price if you enjoy the series, and it supports a charitable cause.  If you've never read the Harry Potter books (or seen the movies, I suppose) then do NOT consider this a sample of the series. You will not glean any sense of the depth, quality and, as everyone else calls it, the magic of the Harry Potter world. This book is a tasty dessert to those who've feasted on the seven-course series.
B001F7MSFM|3.0|I've always been interested in any poject with Ron Perlman.  He is so good at that MENACE stuff, he appears to have something of the dependability Robert Ryan had.  They called him a National Resource.  Mayabe its time to think of Pearlman that way.  No dull screen space anywhere near him.    But...  But, even though I was blown through the roof by HELLBOY, and waited for this production for as long as it took to get the diskette, I was and am disappointed.  Why did I wait so intently and for so long?  Because I'd seen a technical facility in del Toro's work that surpassed any body else's in so many ways -- inventiveness in camera visualization, fantasy articulation in set design, and in costume as well as puppetry -- and an editing smoothness a seamlessness that knocked my sox off.  Many of the scenes called for shots and layouts of such mind-boggling complexity...  Well, if you like these kinds of movies you probably agree.  Why blab on?    In this Golden T__D, the glow was definitely off the banana by the time the meanies got trounced and the soft and fuzzies set in.  I was definitely not interested in the hero's impending fatherhood, and lost all sympathy with the character and with the entire enterprise when the director/scenarist decided to regale us with a male-on-male  Barry Manilow Sing-Along.  Feh!     But, there were some memorable scenes in it; like the one in the inter-specie Souk.    QUESTION:  About the one emminently puzzling facor in this otherwise predictable gob of kiddie Spooky Brand bubblegum.  It's about the obligatory flashlight and fog scene immediaqtely prior to the swarming of the Tooth Faries.  It's just this:  Why did del Toro quote from John Frizzell's score for ALIEN RESURRECTION, Jean-Pierre Junet's final sequel to the Weaver/Ripley Quartette?  Check your copy.  I'm referring to the sequence where Ripley and her peple discover the genetic laboratory where corpses of failed and hideous clones of herself, float in tanks of formalin?  I don't accuse del Toro of plaigerism, he's far too talented and resourceful to have to resort to that.  Myself, I think it's a \\"quote\\"; a section or motif from a film he admires.  Agree?  No?
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Bottom line this was a really FUN movie.  It may not have been a critically acclaimed movie...but we left the theatre laughing and saying \\"Wow that looks like it was so much fun to make!\\"  Some days you just need to put the pen down and enjoy a good laugh.  I bet there were some great cast dinners during that filming!  Its a really fun movie to watch and who cares if Bronson can't sing... it never stopped me from trying either!

0743298039|1.0|I spent too much time slogging through this trash to want to spend another minute writing about it, but I felt it would be a public service to register a minority view. For an alternative read, I recommend The Observations by Jane Harris (try it--you'll thank me).
B001KZJQOU|5.0|I've had this album on vinyl since it came out (and every other Soft Cell album).   I've been searching for the extended version of \\"Say Hello Wave Goodbye\\" for almost that long.  Thank you for including that version on this album.  You made my Friday.  In the U.S., Soft Cell was a one-hit wonder (Tainted Love).  Maybe it's because I heard that song too many times, but most of their other songs are better than \\"Tainted Love\\".      If you like English pop from the 1980's, this would be a good addition to your collection.       Not that it's very important, but they are one of the few popular English bands that sound English when they sing.
0375826726|2.0|I read the first two books, and I thoroughly enjoyed them. They were full of emotion, action, and wonderful writing. But Brisingr was a sad, depressed edition to the series. Most of it was very unneccessary and it was very boring. The only thing that kept me hooked on it was Roran's part of the story. For me, the book seemed a repeat of the last two. Paolini could have done much better, and that's what being a writer is all about, being able to suck the reader into the story, and keep them there until the last page. Brisingr didn't do any of that. I just hope the last book will be an improvement.
B001EOQWEO|1.0|I have to start out by saying that I loved this movie and I could not wait to get a copy. Boy, I didn't know what I was in for.<br /><br />I've returned 3 copies to Wal-Mart now.<br /><br />The movie would skip and freeze, occasionally losing the sound afterward for a few seconds throughout the disc. The odd thing was how the skips occurred at almost the same places on all the discs. I really want to blame the horrid packaging for this movie. The feature film disc was more of less free-floating in the case, a wondrous cardboard concoction that barely holds the disc in place. This applied to both the singe and three-disc versions of the movie.<br /><br />Another problem with this I found out in my efforts to return the movies. Disney has the backing of some sort of federal law (that no one could ever really explain to me) keeping anyone from getting their money back from this movie (and probably others they distribute as well). It took 3 returns and a lot of complaining to some low-level employee to get them to break the rules at Wal-Mart, just to get store credit. It didn't get me what I wanted but it's better than being screwed out of my $30 outright.
B00005U122|4.0|Review no. 237. Main reason I'm giving this 24 song concert DVD a four-and-a-half star rating instead of a five star one is simply because a Roger Waters live performance may just be impossible to capture on film. 'In The Flesh - Live' was recorded in Portland in July, 2000 - about year after I saw him play. Some commented that his show was merely an elaborate slide show just trying to ca$h in on the Pink Floyd name. I, for one really enjoyed (being able to add) the Floyd founder / former bassist to my concert roster. Although I've never gotten too much into his solo material, I felt that Waters had more than the right to get out there on the road to play to eager fans wanting to catch him on tour. Tunes I liked best were \\"Another Brick In The Wall, Part 2\\", the memorable \\"Dogs\\", \\"Welcome To The Machine\\", the Floyd gem \\"Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun\\" (alright - off Floyd's 2nd lp), the mesmerizing \\"Breathe (In The Air)\\", \\"Brain Damage\\" and the FM radio staple \\"Comfortably Numb\\". Recommended.<br /><br />Footnote: I saw Roger Waters this last fall out on tour - performing the entire set of 'The Wall' with his touring twelve-piece band. I sat in front row. Since he's 68 now, I don't know when (or if) I'll get to see him play live again. Would really love to catch him for a third time playing live. Don't you just dig these retrospect tours? When a band / artist plays an entire classic album from beginning to end.
B001BPJJ82|5.0|Spike jonze and David Fincher made a wise decision in backing The Fall. It is beautiful, to say the least. Yes it is visually stunning, but it is the tragedy that makes it gorgeous.<br /><br />I have been wanting to review the Fall for months now, but have avoided the task because sometimes it is impossible to capture an emotion or feeling on the page. Especially one so special. I had the same experience when watching Pan's Labyrinth. I didn't review that one either. They would be great ones to watch back to back.<br /><br />Let me give this a shot.<br /><br />The Fall is captivating. It dances around a mystery then plunges you in so deep that you squirm in your seat. I won't say too much, of little I will reveal, because spoilage is an issue that I want to avoid like the plague in this case. Other reviewers have felt ablidged to reveal plot points and such, but I won't even go that far.<br /><br />I am like that friend that you ask, \\"Have you seen any good movies lately?\\" I say, \\"Sure have. The Fall. Its one of the best movies I have ever seen. It takes me back to my childhood, when movies seemed real. Like riding a luckdragon...\\" You say, \\"Surely it ain't that good.\\" I say, \\"Yeah, it is. If you are into fantasy. Yeah, its a little sad, but in the end it is so cool that... Well, its the first movie in years (besides the Dark Knight) that I immediately wanted to watch again when the credits rolled.\\" You say, \\"It CANT be THAT good...\\". I say, \\"Fo shizzle Dizzle...\\"<br /><br />Anyway, it is in my top 3 for this year. It is in to top 100 of my lifetime. The Fall is so good, so original, so liberating, that I feel you too will be glad you bought it. This isn't one for Netflix. This is one to keep forever. ~saos~<br />__<br /><br />Side Note: Yes, it is in English. Yes, the Blu sparkles. Yes, the sound is fantastic. Yes, you will be showing of your 1080p HD-TV with this disc.<br /><br />Side Fact: Tarsem's last movie was \\"The Cell\\" which was dark and brooding, but also visually stunning.

0425200450|4.0|\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is a true classic of a murder mystery.  Ms. Christie chose Hercule Poirot to try to solve this puzzling mystery.    Someone has been killed.  The someone is not so nice.  The murder took place on The Orient Express, a famous European train.  The train is, at the moment, stranded in a snow drift.  The cast of suspects is varied and unusual.  The solution to the mystery is pure Agatha Christie.    I have, also, seen two or three different video versions of this mystery.  The book seems to have some advantages over the video versions.  Still, it is obvious that this mystery weaves a spell over its fans.      This may be one of the best murder mysteries of all time, but I have never been thrilled with it.  Things get too confusing in parts.  Also, Hercule's accent and unusual character sometimes adds to the confusion.  Finally, it does take effort to follow how the murder must have happened. I wish it were possible to make this story flow a bit better.    Read the book and watch any of the video versions.  I do like Hercule's fi9nal resolution.  And, that says something about us humans.
0143038583|5.0|I enjoyed another book by Pollan and also enjoyed this book, inasmuch that the subject matter can be \\"enjoyed.\\"  It is a distrubing look at the food industry and what is happening to us and our food sources.    Of course some of the examples are not all encompassing and many places may not operate as described, yet there is enough information contained in this book (and news reports that we see and hear about otherwise) that yes these issues exist - the abuse of farmland and the animals that we eat.    I am not sure if the government will ever take the proper action to regulate the food industry and try to improve our food sources nor do I expect people to become vegatarians because of reading this.  But if there can be overall improvements based on thinking about these issues, then the dilemma is a worthwhile presentation.

1594201927|2.0|When I saw the interview with Niall Ferguson on CNN, I thought that I would get an insightful book that would enable me to understand and navigate the current economic crisis. After all, Ferguson is a Harvard professor (thus he is superbly credentialed), and the interview suggested that he had the foresight of the coming events.    Yet the book turned out to be an utter disappointment. On the surface, the book seems to have a good structure. The chapters logically follow a sequence: the history of money, credit, bonds, stocks, insurance, real estate, globalization, hedge funds, computer models of investing, and behavioral finance. The text is easy to read and crafty. However, the chapters fall short on several accounts. The chapters present selected events in the history of their respective subject rather than a broad overview. I did not expect a comprehensive history, but the selection was minimalist, often skewed, and the events were more often than not presented in a disjointed manner. There was some semblance of logic tying them together, but one had to know way more than the average reader to see the connection. If the reader had that kind of knowledge, the book did not offer much. Without the knowledge, the book's logic was lacking and, indeed, contained gaps and jumps.    Even before I reached the end of the book, I developed the feeling that the Author's pretty shameless primary goal was to write a book that can sell many copies, and make money. It is a quickly assembled patchwork that, in spite of the polished writing, is mostly useless fluff. There are much better books on the subject that will explain the concept of money and the current economic crisis. (Just an example: Robert Prechter's Conquer The Crash, published in 2002.) Since the interview on CNN, I heard additional interviews with Niall Ferguson (e.g., on NPR). The timing of the publication and the marketing efforts are way superior to the qualities of the book.    If you can borrow this book from someone, you will only waste some time by reading it, but at least you will save your money. This book is certainly not worth having on your shelf - in the long run it will only collect dust, and you will not open it again. Probably you would be better off not reading it at all (there are better alternatives). The knowledge you will gain is most likely not proportionate with the time invested (wasted) in the reading. The two stars I gave might be a little too generous, especially considering that one expects a much better book from a Harvard professor. However, I have to give credit for the style and a modicum of usefulness.
1840220767|4.0|\\"Complete Sherlock Holmes\\" contains all the Sherlock Holmes stories.      I enjoyed Sherlock Holmes as a teenager and as a young adult and still dip into a Holmes mystery once in a while.  Arthur Conan Doyle created a unique and enduring character when he first wrote of Sherlock Holmes.      However, I do not give these stories that one extra star because some of the stories just do not have any of the magic of the best of the stories.    If this book is taken in big, fast, gulps, the reader may tire of Sherlock's less social traits.  I think this collection is best if taken a little at a time.  There are some terrific stories here.  But, if you insist on devouring several stories at a sitting, the terrific stories will not seem as terrific when ingested along with some of the less terrific stories and things may get confused in your head.    Do read the book.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Evianplace never sent me this product. It was paid for and was to have arrived by November 13th. My two subsequent inquiries have gone unanswered.
0553801503|2.0|Loved the first of this series, and was a bit more lukewarm about the next two. I suspected it was because I was getting lost within the ever-growing cast of characters at work in the story, and this book confirmed this fact with an iron fist.    There is NO main protagonist or antagonist in this book. Instead, we get to follow no fewer than 10 main characters, with at least 100 major characters whose names recurrently appear in long lists. I am impressed with G. Martin's ability to keep track of lineage, but he seems to be more interested in impressing us with his ability to do so rather than creating a dynamic, cohesive story line centered about several strong characters.     After the 100th political squabble about how so-and-so's son was to the heir of this king who was assassinated by this lady but related to this son, which would cause problems for this ruler who was sleeping with this sister, who may have changed her name, I simply couldn't take it anymore. This may sound as if I am exaggerating, but the ENTIRE book is written in this fashion, relentlessly.  (I still finished the book, but it was a painful experience.)    I was thankful every time he returned to the few chapters devoted to the maid-knight Brienne. Not because she was a such a wonderful character, but because she was the only one in the entire book who didn't have an entourage of 20 knights who had to be named in order every time she showed up, as well as 20 enemies whose subplots had to be discussed at every encounter. Her story was lucid understandable, seeking to fulfill an impossible-seeming promise with her honor, yet complex enough to be rich with story. If only the other hundred wasted characters in the book could have had such simple and effective storylines. Why introduce a whole new cast of unknown players when the great original characters had so much to offer?      Almost all of the wonderful strong characters G Martin craftingly built in book one and two are long-gone. Jon Snow, Gregor and Sandor Clegane, and the entire group surrounding them. In their wake are a host of new contenders for the throne, none of which are as appealing as the original. While some may enjoy this whole new cast of characters, I felt that I was \\"fooled\\" into reading this book; very few of the original players were there, and the ones that are still around are virtually unrecognizable. Even the powerful original themes of direwolves and the threat of the rising undead beyond the Wall have been completely abandoned in this book in favor of the mind-numbing lists of inter-family petty squabbles. Even the legendary dragons, whose story and existence held so much promise and excitement in prior books, barely even make an appearance in this book, not even appearing a SINGLE time even 900 pages into the book, and only being talked of in several war councils. Reading this book and not seeing a single direwolf, dragon, undead, or original cast member made me feel as if I had payed full admission to a blockbuster movie, merely to see that they had pulled the entire star-studded cast as well as all the special effects, and replaced them with a low-budget neverending B-movie with a few good trailers interspersed just to tease you into getting (painfully) to the end.     Honestly, the closest comparison I could possibly make with the way this book plays out would be comparing it to one of those long-running, never-ending afternoon soap opera series where there are so many bouts of infidelity and double crossing that your mind can't keep track of them. I assume that was the point of this book, but I approached this series as a fantasy series, not a political soap opera built around petty humans. The lack of true fantasy and magical themes was a complete letdown for me, particularly because he used them sparingly but amazingly effectively in the previous books, preferring to tantalize rather than just crudely and explicitly detail all the magical aspects of the world he had created.He unfortunately does not even bother to tantalize this time around, and completely passes on the fantasy aspect of his world.    It is unfortunate, but because of these problems, I will pass on the rest of his series.
0596007124|2.0|This book is neither an introductory book nor an advanced one. Authors of this book have given thier own interpretations of the design patterns originally defined by GOF book. I bought GOF book several years ago and never got interested to read it because of the way they presented their material so dry. So I bought this book thinking that this would atleast give me some clue. Instead it made things worse. So I opened GOF again started reading and realized that it should have been studied rather than read. So I started a study group with my co workers. Well, it worked really well. I won't say I mastered all the patterns but now I know what those GOF folks are talking about. After understanding those patterns, I started hating this book more. So my recommendation is not to buy this one.

B001GKJ2DY|5.0|A true feel-good movie. It has fun, laughs, a few tears, but it is so joy-filled, it makes me smile just to hear the soundtrack!  So many people analyze movies ad nauseum, but you need to leave the critics at the pop-corn counter and just have fun at this movie.  I admit Pierce Brosnan doesn't sing well, but if you close your eyes and listen to him he's not that bad.  He just looks uncomfortable singing, but otherwise, he's so handsome! Movies have always given good actors a break in the singing department (Rex Harrison in My Fair Lady for one).  Merryl Streep can sing and act, and always seems to bring a tear to my eyes (The Winner Takes It All).  I never thought much of Abba's songs,but they are great when put together with this movie.  Who needs Prozac when there is Mama Mia?!
B001GKJ2DE|5.0|This movie is awesome!  The limited edition blu-ray is great, this is some of the coolest packaging I have seen lately, it is definitely worth the extra money on a purely aesthetic basis...As for the film, well, it is one of the most entertaining movies I have seen in a long time.  This film never stops delivering heart-pounding action sequences and witty dialogue.  The plot is straight-forward and it is well-acted.  Wanted's special effects sequences are great as well.<br />I highly recommend this movie for all action fans and if you like to collect  movies go ahead and splurge on the limited edition...it is well worth it!

0545128285|5.0|The Tales of Beedle the Bard was a wonderful read. Not only did we get four original tales from Beedle, aside from The Tale of the Three Brothers from Deathly Hallows, but there was insightful and entertaining commentary provided by none other than Albus Dumbledore himself which he wrote 18 months before his death. Jo was kind enough to provide additional info that Muggles may not be accustomed to as well.    We not only got some interesting insight about the background of the stories and Beedle's inspiration for writing them, but we got neat little tidbits about the Wizarding World as well, such as some background into Nearly Headless Nick's demise, Professor Kettleburn (the CoMC teacher before Hagrid), some of Malfoy's relatives, as well as several other awesome facts that JKR never got to include in the main series.    Out of all of the stories, I'd have to say that my favorite is The Fountain of Fair Fortune, although they're all amazing as I knew they would be.    All in all it was, as Jo Rowling always produces, a wonderfully imaginative, entertaining, brilliant read, with dashes of humor here and there that she has mastered so wonderfully. The Tales of Beedle the Bard, therefore, comes highly recommended!     P.S. Grumble the Grubby Goat FTW.
B001GJOL22|5.0|The enthusiasm level and musicianship was nothing short of amazing. Much better than when I saw them this summer where they were just going through the motions and making more mistakes than I've heard out of them in their entire live career.  I love the band and this video captured Rush firing on all cylinders.
B001M6KTLG|1.0|Yes, it's a very bold statement to never want to see a Lucas or Spielberg film again. But all of the negative commentary you've heard about the movie was true. Miracle refrigerators that save Indy from nuclear testing, Lebeauf swinging in the trees with the monkeys, crystal skulls that look like they were purchased from a local costume shop, and of course... ALIENS. And let's not forget that all the \\"special\\" effects look like nothing more than CGI on a soundstage. At the very least, the first three are classic, epic films. If you love the first three, please don't see this film.
0743270754|5.0|I have 20 pages left to read of this magnificent 754-page wonder and I truly hate for it to end.<br /><br />For me, storytellers make the best historians.  Stephen Ambrose, my favorite, is a natural-born storyteller (Band of Brothers, Crazy Horse and Custer, Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West, etc.)<br /><br />His approach:  \\"In each case I am telling a story--I think of myself as sitting around the campfire after a day on the trail, telling stories that I hope will have the members of the audience, or the readers, leaning forward just a bit, wanting to know what happens next.\\"<br /><br />That is exactly what DKG has done in this wonderful book.  Anyone, especially a scholar, who can record historical events through a page-turner like this is immensely gifted.<br /><br />I will make it a point henceforth to read this lady's writing.<br /><br />She and Ambrose and William Manchester and perhaps a small handful of others are to historical writing what Stephen King is to horror fiction.
B001GKJ2E8|4.0|If you are looking for a movie that is entertaining, and has great matrixy special effects....you've found it.  If you are looking for an oscar winning movie this is not for you.  I do not go to the movies for realism..I live that every day.  I go to the movies to escape, and have fun....that is why I like this film.  It has a good cast and an entertaining story.  As unrealistic as it is, I dare you to find a guy out there who would not jump at the opportunity to live this guy's life!  Take a chance on this one..it is worth it!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I never have time to watch television shows when they air throughout the week, so this wave of TV-on-DVD has been great for me.  Normally, I purchase one of these DVD sets and it takes me a couple of months to finish the contents.  Not the case with Showtime's Dexter.<br /><br />I had initially rejected the idea of this show.  I'm not one for excess gore or the glorification of killing you find in some horror movies these days.  I approached the series apprehensively, but once I started I was hooked.  The concept of the series (a man addicted to killing) reminded me of the premise behind the Kevin Costner film Mr. Brooks, only Dexter targets criminals to fuel his addiction.  And, well, this television series works better than that film.<br /><br />Dexter is a forensics tech for the Miami PD, and the length of Season One deals with his interaction with a serial killer who becomes known as \\"the Ice Truck Killer.\\"  The story arc sets off from the conclusion of Episode One, and it never lets up.  There's mystery, intrigue, and, thanks to his incredibly foul-mouthed sister Debra (also a cop), comedy.<br /><br />This is a great show that would catch any willing viewer's attention.  Personally, I didn't find it all that gory.  There is a lot of killing, but the actual deed isn't shown.  Still, it's a dark show that won't be a cup of tea for the light-hearted.<br /><br />Overall, Season One of Dexter is TV at its finest and highly deserving of 5/5 stars.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Because the workouts are only 20 minutes, and because they are easy to follow and very difficult - this has been the only workout video that I've been motivated enough to do regularly 3 times a week since purchasing it.  I just tried Workout #2 and I can tell that once I get to the third workout, I will be shredded physically... the moves are simple: jumping jacks, pushups, squats, planks, etc.. and those are the moves that are tried and true for getting your body into shape.  Others find Jillian annoying, but I think she is cute and good at motivating you to finish the last rep.  I finally can do ONE real push-up (no knees) and that is a landmark for me in my fitness!!  And I see real definition in my hamstrings - never have before!    I don't know what the \\"30-day\\" part of the title means, because in no way would I master Workout 1 in 30-days let alone the whole DVD!
B001GKYBXA|4.0|This cd, a great collaboration between Paul McCartney and electronica innovator Youth, could easily have been released as a \\"proper\\" Paul McCartney album, and just as easily could be - and perhaps should be - considered McCartney III (or perhaps Ram II). As many reviewers have noted, there's a ramshackle, homespun, loose feeling to the songs and the album construction that is reminiscent of McCartney, Ram, and McCartney II.<br /><br />As a lifelong McCartney fan, I've been overjoyed this past decade or so, as he has released great album after great album. From \\"Flaming Pie\\" through to this new one, each album has been bursting with the his trademark melodicism and inspiration. The trend continues with Electric Arguments. I love the rockers here, like \\"Nothing Too Much Just Out of Sight\\" and \\"Highway.\\" \\"Two Magpies\\" is the kind of sweet little song that gave his early albums so much flavor. And \\"Sing the Changes\\" is another perfect pop song from the man who essentially perfected the art form way back when. Then there's the dynamic Indian and electronica flourishes, too. Tons of great stuff packed into an hour of inspired music.<br /><br />Whether the songs were written and recorded in a single day each (as they were here) or labored over for months on end, the only thing that matters in the end is if they're good or not. And Electric Arguments delivers. If you've enjoyed McCartney's recent solo work, don't miss out on this one.
B000V86OKG|3.0|My opinion of Dexter's second season may be skewed by the fact that I began watching it almost as soon as I had finished Season One.  While the first season kept me on edge and in constant anticipation of what would come next, this season left me much less inspired.  Some of the story arcs felt wooden and not nearly as creative or engaging as the original twelve episodes.  I worried that the absence of the Ice Truck Killer plot might negatively affect this season, and unfortunately I found this to be the case.  Not to mention many of the scenarios stretch the imagination a bit too far.<br /><br />I can see from other Amazon reviews that I'm in the minority opinion on this.  To each their own, right?  It's funny how people can respond so differently to things like films and books and television series.<br /><br />While I didn't particularly enjoy this season of Dexter, I still find it to be a very crafty show that, even when it's not that good, is impossible to look away from.  While I was hoping for a more commanding follow-up to the amazing first season, Dexter is still one of the better programs on television.  It's easy to see why Showtime has found its greatest success with this show.
B000021YQV|5.0|If you're into nu-metal/rock music, you should know a couple other bands like Slipknot, Sevendust, Deftones, etc.. System of A Down is just right there with those well known bands. Many listeners don't feel like after listening to their tracks. They complain about the strange sounding verses. Once in a while there's the freaked out verses and bridges too. At first I couldn't take it, it sounded silly to me. Later after listening to their albums thoroughly, I noticed it's not odd at all. It's actually quite entertaining. Lyrics are all bounded by the titles of the tracks. If you don't know, their tracks are political. Their choruses are super catchy, an average 5 year old can sing the choruses of each sound for you.    I like the goofiness they give in the songs. It's a pleasure to listen to their music.     There're a few songs I particularly like, those are radio hits too. Aerial and Chop Suey! Great intros on both songs.
0743297334|5.0|First read \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" in 1980 and reread it every couple of years. It should be enjoy at least 5 time a decade.
0956010903|2.0|I'm glad to hear that people are enjoying their books so much, but I'm having a moment of desperate indecision. My CE copy came yesterday and I was so excited! Even the packaging was exciting (a lot of people were upset because they bought it as a surprise and the packaging ruined it).    But when I finally got my first look at the actual book, I was a bit disappointed. I mean, I just paid $100 for this book and I expected it to be perfection. But it wasn't. The metal corner pieces weren't straight or even, which made the center piece off-center, and even the clasp was in the wrong place (in my opinion of course). Now, I was happy to spend the $100 (which is a LOT of money for a book when you are a really broke 20-something struggling to pay bills) as I imagined this beautiful volume in my collection, but I have to be realistic. It looks cheap. The stories are very good, but I could have read those in the $10 regular edition.    Maybe I'm being too nit-picky. I haven't found a single other review that was complaining of these same issues. Did I just get a dud copy? Or am I being silly to be upset by these problems?
0385340990|3.0|I love historical fiction and I found this book to be thought provoking.<br />I will be doing more research on the topic. Problem is the book is light and sweet with predictable sterotypes.  Sort of a Danielle Steele meets Grapes of Wrath.  The shock and the horror of the time period is lost. Worth reading but only because it is short.
B000QEIOUS|5.0|I loved the movie. It is very inspiring, regardless of the critiques about it noy being \\"realistic\\". Since when are movies realistic?    Anyway, the part I miss in the disc version and feel a bit dissapointed is the one at the near end of the movie where Pacino tells the Puerto Rican cleaning lady at the hotel that Puerto Rican soldiers are the best in the world. I just wonder if anyone else has noticed this cut and why would that happen.
B001F290E4|5.0|While driving into work this morning I heard 3 cuts from the SEAL SOUL album and I must admit I screammed out loud on all three of them starting with If You Don't Know Me By Now, then I Cant Stand The Rain and It's A Man's World.  I have beautiful childhood memories associated with these songs when they were hits back in the \\"day\\", with I Can't Stand The Rain being amongst my all time favs.  I salute you Seal...Fantastic Job.  BTW I plan to purchase 5 CDs and give 4 of them as Xmas gifts the 5th one's for me.  Thanks Seal & Happy Holidays everyone!

B0007MWZEK|5.0|I asked for my sweeper and received it as a wedding shower gift at the suggestion of my sister, busy mom of 3 kids under 5 (who swears by her sweeper).<br /><br />I see a lot of complaints that the swivel sweeper does not hold a charge.  I am not one to read directions, but I happened across someone who mentioned a line of the directions when I was reading reviews for the sweeper.  Seeing as how so many people are still giving negative reviews, I thought it worth reposting.<br /><br />You cannot charge the battery for more than 24 hours consecutively.  Plug it in, and unplug it after a day.  My sweeper has worked great for over 2 years with heavy use.  I don't know why this makes a difference, but the people who follow these instructions have not had any issues and love their sweeper.  Of course, you would never know this if you don't read all of the instructions.<br /><br />The swivel sweeper is not a vacuum.  It's an electric broom.  It's not meant to take the place of a vacuum... it's good for cleaning up debris before you clean the floor (like a broom!).  I've even used it to clean hair off the kitchen floor after at-home haircuts.  One swipe and the mess is gone.  It's awesome at sweeping up Christmas tree needles and crumbly messes.  You still need to vacuum your rugs, but this helps with the quick messes in between.  I hope this helps you feel more confident about the sweeper.

B001EN71CW|5.0|I started watching this last night and was blown away by the detail. Either I am color-blind or close to because I discovered that light & vivid colors have now made this series a great favorite. I have watched the original several times and it didn't compare. Not movie quality, of course, but well, well way worth it to me.
B0001EFTVA|5.0|OK,  a few people thought that this movie was wonderful,  but didn't like the divine intervention bits in it.  Isn't that what Christmas movies are about,  though?

B0001WGIBW|5.0|This is a great expansion set. We liked it so much we bought two of them. One simply wasn't enough. The most useful pieces were the ones with two 'outies' and two 'innies'. The extra long pieces and extra short curves were very useful too.<br /><br />This has seen much use by two adults and three children who like to play with the train set. They have been stepped on, put together and taken apart more times than we can count and they are still going strong.<br /><br />Well worth the money.<br />Enjoy.

B00000IUKW|4.0|I have rated this item a little bit lower because it does not come with anything else besides these two train tracks. These two wavy train tracks need something under them to build a hill/bridge. It would be nice if you could buy a set with blocks that could be used to hold up the pieces. We have used a small blocks from our own block set to hold up the pieces and that worked fine.<br /><br />These are sturdy pieces that have been through three kids playing and playing and stepping on them and setting them up and taking them down and so on. They have made our train tracks much more fun.<br /><br />Well worth the money. Just be warned you will need something to 'hold up the hill/bridge'.<br />Enjoy.
B00003CXXP|2.0|I liked the film and I will see it again. But really, with the limitless scope of a concept like Artificial Intelligence, was that the best the writers could come up with? Blue Fairies and Wannabe Boy Robots? Yes, the film has several layers and I get the idea of our creations inheriting the Earth while we fizzle out from uselessness... \\" a whimper, not a bang.\\" We could have had concepts such as AI in the workplace, AI in the church, AI in the spiritual life, the real human arena. What does it mean to be human and who created us? Those would be grand topics to pursue in a film. Not this. Watching this piece is sort of like listening to Mahler on a Hurdy Gurdy; its recognizable maybe, but it just shouldn't be done.
031606792X|2.0|Okay, I really wanted to give Ms. Meyer the benefit of the doubt. Her writing is sub-par but in the end, I DID want to know what happened to her characters, and so I kept reading this unfortunate \\"saga\\". As I made it through the first, second, and third books, I became more and more concerned with Bella and Edward's youthful obsession with each other, and eventually with Edward's insistance on Bella marrying him, not to mention the horrible way she treats Jacob (who of course isn't perfect, but she was very selfish throughout her relationship with him).<br /><br />Then came this travesty.<br /><br />***Spoiler alert***<br /><br />It is not, not, NOT appropriate to write a novel KNOWING that it will be read by millions of teenage girls and have the entire theme be girl graduates high school, girl gets married two months later to the only boy she has ever had a relationship with, immediately gets pregnant and decides to keep the baby that is basically going to kill her, becomes a vampire and lives completely happily ever after after a slightly annoying encounter with the big bad Volturi--who just WALK AWAY rather than fight the Cullen family. I understand that this is fiction, that it is fantasy, etc. etc...but the fact of the matter is, young, impressionable girls are OBSESSED with this saga and I just don't feel like it offers any positive ideas on life, love, family, etc.
B000HT386M|5.0|i think is a great movie!!  It tells you that you have to live life to the fullest and enjoy every single minute of it, while with family getting ready for work, kids, driving... etc. There are alot of stupid people that don't get the point or message of the movie, that's why I'm here 4...!  Thanks 4 reading I hoped u enjoyed this minute of ur life!
1416550518|5.0|I just loved this book. As I started I thought this book was going to bore me. Boy was I ever wrong. I learned to love the characters and really relate to their feelings and desires in life. Lives can get so tangled up at times and this is portrayed superfinley in this great novel. So, real that I really felt I was there. I sat up late nights sometimes till four in the morning gulping down the scenes. I highly recommend this book for a variety of reasons. It pulled on my heartstrings.

0545128285|3.0|I have not read the book or even seen it yet, but I ordered it as a Christmas present for my nephew and had it delivered to my sister's house. I anticipated it to be delivered in a standard Amazon shipping box, since I had marked it as a gift. My sister told me it arrived yesterday in a box sreaming Harry Potter jargon including \\"Attention Muggles\\" and even had the book title on the box. My nephew saw it, but has not heard of the book yet, so he didn't get too clued in, but knows it is 'something Harry Potter'. A real disappointment to the Christmas morning element of surprise I had been going for.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This is a great movie and you should buy it ASAP.    To all you idiots giving it 1 star because people are reviewing it before it comes out, \\"GET A LIFE\\".  Who made YOU the amazon review police?  If people want to review the movie, and not the actual DVD quality, its none of your business.  Besides, you are not following review ettiquette either by giving 1 star to a movie that deserves at least 3, even if you didn't care for it.  You are bringing down it's score so you can make some childish point about when people SHOULD review a movie.    You guys are a bunch of idiots.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|Very talented.  Not disappointed at all, if anything I was surprised at the quality of each of the songs.  Several of his songs are not only great to listen to, but also very touching and personal.  I'm not sure why anyone would rate this lower than a four, but then again, maybe they were just in a bad mood that day...
0321544080|1.0|First of all, his review is from an aspiring amateur photographer who never intends to be a pro. So, if you are a pro, you may ignore this review. The pictures in the book are awesome. That's for sure. However, they are like, pictures from a helicopter, pictures from on top of New York skyscraper construction, pro-football cheer leaders' locker room, etc... and then the author explains shortly how to get this type of shot. And for most of the shots in this book, the author says that he used assistants for lighting. But average amateur photographers will never be in the Moment It Clicks and will never get an assistant for lighting equipments. I don't think that I am going to fly over New York in helicopter, or in any city what so ever. For most of learning amateur photographers, what they will learn after they read this book is that they will not be able to do somehing like this, unless they change their jobs.    This book is only for professional photo journalists.

185686992X|4.0|This was my first Grisham read: I don't count the first two hundred pages of The Street Lawyer, since that simply doesn't compare to the power of A Time to Kill. He clearly blows the doors of legal fiction clean off-- for five hundred pages. The last twenty-eight, however...    Every character and situation is well-thought out and creates real tension: constant conflict between Brigance and Buckley, Noose, the Klan, and everyone else, it seems. Wilbanks is clearly the most fun, albeit a bit of a glorification of alcoholism, and his interludes with Vonner and Roark are very amusing. Grisham did a fantastic job, especially considering that this was his first novel: an inspiration to amateur authors everywhere.    I did think, however, that the denouement was very short and collapsed, and had to warrant the docking of a star. Too many questions left unanswered: any resolution with Tim \\"Mickey Mouse\\" Nunley's death? What happened to Roark? What happened to her father? There seemed to be no reference to the relationship between Brigance and Roark after the scene at the catfish restaurant. How did Jake's wife and daughter take the destruction of their home and \\"death in the family\\"? Did Ethel ever forgive him? I just think Grisham could have added a few extra paragraphs not focused on margaritas and press conferences.    All in all, this is great fiction, and contains excellent legal process scenes as well. Attorneys recovering from law school will love it, but the layman will find it accessible as well. Start with this... and stay away from the Street Lawyer.

It's true, there is nothing fast or upbeat about this CD, it's more calm and peaceful, which is quite nice when you're in the midst of the holiday rush.

B001BKG9SK|4.0|I received this CD/DVD combo just two days ago. At first glance, while the whole graphic concept is really attractive and nicely done, the package quality was below my expectations, the materials seems somehow cheap and the discs have a tendency to fell out from the envelope (something similar happened to me with the PULSE - red blinking light - CD package). But this failure can be easily overlooked because the sound and picture quality were good and this is what really matters. As for the song selection, it is easy for us, Pink Floyd fans, to expect as much as many Floyd material as possible, but, although this is a truly David Gilmour set, is a nice and pleasant one.  I would prefer a less \\"On an Island\\" product, but for that case we have the two previous DVDs released by David.  There are two important highlights here: the Echoes full performance in the third disc and the Barn Jam sessions in the fourth one. In my case, this two peak points justifies the whole set.  Specially the Barn Jam sessions.  I am a dedicated Pink Floyd fan and for me it was very sad to see Rick Wright in what may be one of the lasts recorded performances of him.  It's paradoxical: in my case this collection is more about Wright than Gilmour, at least while I get used to the idea that the great keyboardist is no longer among us.
B000QUCNP4|3.0|The worldview of Director David Fichner has always been a dour and dark one. From his first big splash of the wildly underrated [[ASIN:B00000ILDF Alien 3]] and the the genre redefining [[ASIN:B000050FEN Se7en]], he approaches the noir of details like few others. However, this attention to the underbelly takes a toll on \\"Zodiac,\\" a serial killer film that spends more time on the soul killing of the killer's trackers than on the killer itself.<br /><br />The movie is basically a two-parter, with the first detailing real-life San Francisco Chronicle reporter Paul Avery (an animatedly off-center Robert Downey Jr, giving early glimpses at his soon to exlpode comeback), an SF Homicide Detective David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and the killer as he picks off his victims in a rather non-sensationalist manner. The victims pile up and the city is thrown into paranoia, Avery and Toschi become obsessed with catching this modern-day Jack The Ripper. When he stays constantly one step ahead of capture and cunningly taunts his pursuers, everyone involved begins to spiral down. Once Avery suspects he is in the killer's cross-hairs, he no longer can report and soon becomes another kind of victim.<br /><br />That's when \\"Zodiac\\" lurches into a lumbering and poorly paced second half. Editorial Cartoonist and real-life author of this film's source book, [[ASIN:0425212181 Zodiac]], Robert Graysmith becomes inexplicably obsessed with the killer and begins to pick up where everyone else gave up. The problem is that Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) was just incidental to the first half of the film, and he was more annoying than purposeful. When he blossoms into this full-blown super-snoop, it barely seems plausible. And given that almost all the main characters from the first 90 minutes have disintegrated in their failure to apprehend Zodiac, the movie becomes Gyllenhaal's to carry.<br /><br />As Graysmith's obsession to the case becomes more neurotic, freneticism takes over and paranoid raves/rants/red herrings begin to overwhelm the character and the movie. Gyllenhaal pounding on Detective Toschi's window at midnight in the pouring rain was almost cringe inducing, as was the claustrophobic basement scene with the former film-house owner. Graysmith, like the others chasing The Zodiac ahead of him, soon gets pulled into the vortex with unsavory results. Yet in the first part of the film, there were multiple people getting torn apart in this investigative black hole, making \\"Zodiac\\" palpable. Graysmith's trip down the cliff is tedious and, frankly, unbelievable.<br /><br />While the grim circumstances are played to a fair historical accuracy and with Fichner's customery cool manner, a little judicious editing might have trimmed this to a more palatable film. There are too many detours and sidelines, making \\"Zodiac\\" something close to a documentary than a drama, which leaves you without any good guys or bad guys. Towards the end, I just wanted Graysmith to STFU and finish his book, and couldn't even root for the anti-hero suspect (a creepy John Carroll Lynch), because anyone worth cheering for was now soul-dead. The final credit postlogue told the story of just how deeply the players were all affected, but \\"Zodiac\\" is primarily about the victims the murderer let live; Toschi, Avery and Graysmith, and how he killed them all the same.verwhelm the character and the movie.

It's a quick read, but it offers good insight into the wizard world, especially the final tale \\"The Tale of the Three Brothers,\\" which is so prevalent in Book 7.  The tales are short and charming and the commentary from Dumbledore is refreshing, bringing back a voice many readers have missed.

B001ED7C5I|5.0|Attempting to write a worthy review of a single Tracy Chapman release is difficult, in the same way it would be hard to try and define a person you deeply love in a single paragraph; there's always the desire to go back and forth in time, the necessity to find a more perfect word or phrase or example deserving of the one who has so captured your heart. And so it is with this remarkable woman. Tracy Chapman has a voice equally capable of soothing a frightened child into a sound slumber, or awakening a generation to a social emergency. And as her muse has led her deep into a third decade of artistry, those wise enough to have accompanied her on her ascendant journey have undoubedly had their musical world deepened, ripened and enriched. Music should move you, but sometimes it should also shake you.  Tracy knows this.  If she'd not chosen to do music, I have little doubt that she would have found some other means of reaching us with her unwavering commitment to love, peace and social justice.  Thankfully, she chose music, which for me is the most direct and accessible vehicle for inspiration.<br /><br />I was immediately struck (and, I'll admit, a bit surprised) by the title of this release. It begged a number of questions, which is, of course, what Art should do.  Is she referring to a lover?  Could she possibly be so optimistic about our country's future?  But just as I stated, a phrase-or in this case, a song title-could hardly hope to explain everything being said in this beautiful collection.  Throughout, Tracy walks a narrow line between sadness and anger, but also with an ever-present undercurrent of hope that our \\"bright future may come to pass.\\" There are personal stories, and there are songs trying to make sense of what has, and continues to go on across the planet.  Through it all--the pain, the anger, the losses and the fears,  she conveys, and convincingly, a genuine belief in what is still possible. Perhaps it is the most extraordinary thing about Chapman's music, and one of the reasons why people are still listening, waiting to hear what she has to say next.  I think what I most love about Tracy is her ability to put her arms around any issue, large or small, personal or political, and somehow, with that rich and remarkable voice, make me feel that she is in my presence, breathing, singing only to me.<br /><br />Three years ago I was privileged to see Tracy Chapman in concert, and to do so with a woman who, believe it or not, loves Tracy even more than I do.  There were moments that night when the considerable distance between the stage and our seats seemed to go away, and it felt to me as if Tracy was singing only to us.

B00004TH7Z|4.0|The first Iron Maiden album of the new millennium, \\"Brave New World\\" features Maiden's strongest lineup to date. The album starts out incredibly strong, buts wanes (only slightly) as it winds down, creating a slightly lopsided album. But with tracks like \\"The Wicker Man\\" and \\"Blood Brothers,\\" it has the hits, and with no unnecessarily lengthened songs (or just plain bad ones), this goes down as one of the most solid Iron Maiden albums ever.
0307455874|4.0|Barack Obama's first book [[ASIN:1400082773 Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance]] was a more personal account of his family and childhood. This is more his public face, especially on his stand on different issues. His views are nuanced and you learn that as you read this book.    I found the book politically inspiring because Obama's message is for Americans to get involved. He wants you to get beyond cynicism, division and passivity, and become engaged by a personal cause that you believe in.     It doesn't really matter what but make a difference for our nation. Obama is a voice for moderation and centerist policies and that comes through in this book.    Besides the books by President Obama, I also recommend [[ASIN:0978107004 Nexus: A Neo Novel]] a book that I found spiritually uplifting.
0446525537|3.0|Ok. I'll be really nice. I liked the story. I found the writing style a little annoying but I do understand that it's supposedly being told by a 17-year-old, and so I could overlook this. I also wonder at the chances of a boy that young experiencing the pure, true love described in this book...But, overall, it was an enjoyable story, and a real tear-jerker at the end. I'd say it was worth the read but it was only ok for me.<br /><br />Word of advice: Read the book before watching the movie. The movie is more realistically portrayed and when viewed first, makes the book far less enjoyable...

B00004S35Z|5.0|Fulfillingness First Finale is a great album, just like probably everything Stevie Wonder created in the 70's (I haven't heard anything more than the \\"big four\\" albums).  One thing that's STILL a bit underrated about Stevie Wonder is his ability to combine soul, funk and pop together, and make something radically new (at the time).  More importantly, he combined those things and made them *interesting*.  There's only one Stevie Wonder, and there will never be someone as good as this guy ever again.      Favorite songs?  Well, I don't know really.  Stevie Wonder is one of those musicians where you have a different favorite every time you play one of his albums.  That's a sign of a great musician.  Right now it's probably \\"Heaven is 10 Billion Light Years Away\\" which for some reason, reminds me of those school field trips we used to take as children.  I guess the adventurous atmosphere contribues to those feelings.    \\"They Won't Go When I Go\\" is an Elton John sounding song that rules a lot.  Just a chilling, haunting and eerie song.  \\"Bird of Beauty\\" and \\"Please Don't Go\\" are very good melodically.  \\"Boogie on Reggae Woman\\" is one of those songs that might still be heard on TV shows, radio stations, and other places.  Honestly, it SHOULD be played more often because it's a classic, but you know how stubborn radio stations and whatnot can be when it comes to variety.    The funkiness of \\"You Haven't Done Nothin\\"  is fantastic as well.  The only song I don't really care for is \\"Creepin\\" because it sounds a bit stuck in the mid 70's and not melodic enough for me.  I don't know what the general opinion of this song is, but to me, it comes up a bit short compared to the rest of the tracks.    The rest of the album is pure emotional, melodic genius.  For that (which is very important obviously) this is a classic album.

This dvd has it all!!<br /><br />  Dr. Horrible's Sing along blog was created by Joss Whedon during the writers strike on a relatively low budget and at a hectic pace.  Despite that, it gained enormous popularity on the web--through old fashioned word of mouth (No glitzy milion dollar ad campaign here...no sir.)<br /><br />  Like many of my fellow reviewers, I heard alot of buzz about this from friends, my brother, online gamers..and initially saw it on hulutv. (it was so popular when it was first released that it crashed the site!)  Then I just had to buy the webisodes on Itunes, then i bought the soundtrack.  It is still not enough!!  I have been eagerly awaiting the DVD for all the extra goodness--musical commentary! (yay)  Making of the show (woohoo!)<br /><br />  You'll find the songs so catchy that you'll be humming them for weeks.  Neil Patrick Harris is amazing as the title villain--I can't imagine any other actor who would bring to life Dr. Horrible with such glee.  Felicia Day was perfect as Penny and I became such a fan that it led me to her own little web show--the Guild.  This DVD a must see for you and for everyone on your christmas list.<br /><br />  Watch it and you'll be an instant fan.  \\"The Hammer is my ____\\"  \\"We do the wierd stuff.\\"  Classic!

But when you have the time to listen to it as a whole, its strengths come out to play. Viva la Vida is errie, happy, scary, sad, joyful, and exciting (but mostly mournful) over a 50 minute period. Its not my favorite album of the decade so far (Green Day's \\"American Idot\\" takes that spot), but it is powerful nonetheless. This album is spiritual and joyuce, and hopefully is an insight to the future of Coldplay.

0810995212|5.0|This book is definitely worth it if only for the quality of the illustrations. Some people in these reviews point out some inaccuracies in the text regarding either the authenticity of some paintings, some details about Leyendecker's life and that of his contemporaries and some interpretations regarding his real influence on the American psyche. A lot of people seem to take issue with the central role the authors give to Leyendecker's life-long relationship with Charles Beach and with his sexual orientation in general as if it permeated everything he did.     If anything, I wish the text had had a little bit more information on the actual techniques and methods of creation. Some hints are given but it would have been nice to find out about the actual studio and his materials. Also, it would have been of great help to determine where the paintings are located today. May be even more interesting than describing the fate of Mount Tom's. Leyendecker's residence.        Despite this voids, the artwork of J.C. Leyendecker is so splendid that a book like this, that has achieved the best reproductions to date in this sort of tome, must be at the top of my list. And some of the author's interpretations are their own to have, I certainly agree that  homoeroticism permeates a big part of the artwork and that Leyendecker helped settled many of the archetypes we see as American today. I do not take issue with that and I think the authors have a right to a certain point of view even when they do not have the right to add extraneous details, specially with no documentation.
1416594884|3.0|High expectations accompanied the publication of this book. This was my \\"first ever\\" read of a Le Carre novel. Frankly, it seemed to be a \\"long way to a little house.\\" In a word, \\"A Most Wanted Man\\" lacks literary value. And, worse, it is only mildly entertaining. I vastly prefer Alan Furst's work, the very author that the NY Times asked to review this book. He praised it - sort of. I don't quite understand what's so hot about Le Carre. I've read a couple hundred espionage thrillers in my time, and this one ranks in the bottom half of the pile.<br /><br />While the story line of \\"A Most Wanted Man\\" and most of the characters were all very contemporary in a setting (Hamburg, Germany) appropriate to modern day terrorist tensions, the story itself was simple, though obscure, equivocal, and ambiguous.  The tale needed grand scale elaboration to fill the pages, which was provided. The \\"voice\\" of the book varies back and forth from forceful to pedantic, and ends without a clear single voice. The language varies from slangy ordinariness to the philosophical erudite.  (Why give the German speakers a \\"print accent?\\")  At times the \\"plot\\" is so obscure as to be unfathomable.<br /><br />The German characters, to my mind, were ----- well, so \\"German,\\" and by that I mean they all fit some ghastly stereotype already existing in the reader's head. For some reason I expected the primary characters to have much more depth and breadth and had hoped that this author would escape the standard, awful time-worn and discredited characterizations of Germans.  From \\"masculine\\" women to stiff-backed, unemotional and scheming men (whose real selves showed up only in their silent thinking -- but not in their words or actions), we are deluged with these oh-too-German-Germans. I had to suspend belief of their shallowness in order to get even mildly wrapped up in their rather interesting antics. Le Carre seems really to have had a hard time escaping his apparent habits as a writer of \\"cold war\\" espionage and the too-easy-to-stereotype East Germans of the time.  The Americans, at the end, were also \\"so American!\\" Ugh! And Issa, the main character?  He was bizarre, a bit crazy, wholly unbelievable, and was a major disappointment. Annabel was psychologically tortured and lacked credibility, a woman who way too easily sold out her brittle beliefs and was never once true to herself, except at some fleeting incomprehensible moments. The British? The Muslims? The Russians? The Turks? Others? Can't we escape these awful stereotypes?  All were disappointingly and decidedly cookie-cutter.  I was simply unable to \\"like\\" any of them, especially the primary players. A couple of the minor players were appealing, however, especially the two Turks (the mother and her son) who sheltered Issa at the beginning. Brue's wife was also interesting. Funny how the cameo players turned out to be more interesting than those in the main cast!<br /><br />The final 80+ pages actually moved along rapidly with rising tension and danger. That was good. For the first time in a long time, I did not read (half way through the book) the final 5 pages to see who was still alive and kicking at the end. Kudos to Le Carre for that! Nonetheless, all the players, the institutions and their interests were so confusing and blurry that I had trouble keeping track of who was who and what their actions meant.  Why don't these espionage thriller authors do what any sane playwright does and provide a list of players and their roles at the beginning?<br /><br />The plot is obscure to a fault. And it's all about money, from start to finish. The people are unnecessarily mysterious and enigmatic. The interplay among them and their various national, institutional, personal, religious or ethnic interests were confusing and convoluted. The reader is included in enlightening plot details only when Le Carre decided to let us in on what's going on. While extraordinarily different one from the other, in the final analysis all characters were selfish and ethno-centered to their own disastrous ends.  The primary characters were ALL neurotic, despotic and at a fundamental level - in print - quite uninteresting. There were no memorable lines to underline and mull over, no moments of clarity of any philosophy, no insight into human values, and little promise in any of the endless philosophizing by several primary voices. What drove these people to their inhuman and often crazed ends completely escaped me. No action, no moral philosophy and no motivation in these totally despicable people redeems. They're all unsavory, dishonest and in the final analysis -- unnecessary.<br /><br />The end was a total let-down, a huge disappointment, vague and unsatisfying<br /><br />So why read it?

0446615641|5.0|I thought Stone Cold was a great read. The 3rd in the Camel Club series, the book kept me turning pages to see the next action and adventure.  Baldacci gives you characters that you love and characters that you despise.  Some action may be what some folks have referred to as unbelievable, but that is why I read fiction.  I love a book that is fast paced, suspenseful, and intriguing.   This book did not disappoint.  I have read all of Baldacci's books and l love his writing style.    I highly recommend this book.  (Read the first two of the series first.)
B001230JXC|5.0|The height of DM's techno-pop brilliance.<br />Packed with catchy hits, \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" still dominates.<br /><br />This MP3 version is a great deal.<br />You get the remastered versions of the original tracks AND songs that were previously only available on singles and remix albums.<br /><br />Take a listen and see why 1990 was such a good year.
B0017ZB8M6|2.0|According to popular consensus, this album has been something like three or four years in the making; the MATRIX's number one maven Katy Perry finally drops her debut album (at least under the name she is currently going by these days), and it is nothing more than a ho-hum affair.<br /><br />Perry strives to be Pink (the artist as well as the color), but only gets halfway there, ending up a cross between Alanis Morissette and Avril Lavigne. The album has a little more of a dance vibe to it; the hooks are typical MATRIX stuff. These tracks (including the trashy hit single \\"I Kissed a Girl\\") have all been done by someone before in some form or another. The actual title of that song was even done before, by Jill Sobule in 1995. It is the same concept, not the same song (like you'll care about concepts if you are buying this CD anyways).<br /><br />So, years in the making, Katy Perry finally hits the scene, and it is now apparent why there were so many failed attempts before. She has nothing to say - at least nothing new. And after her album and image has been panned by critics all over the world (she was actually referred to as a \\"trollop\\" in the Allmusic Guide), of course she becomes a number-one hit. She should enjoy the ride now, because it will be brief. Strutting around poking fun at gays, geeks, and ex's might work if you are a second-rate stand-up comedian, but not if you want to maintain a long-term chart performance. If Britney Spears would have released a song as vulgar as some of these, she would have been exiled. It's a double-standard. Katy Perry is manufactured and fake, just another marketing tool (with the primary focus on TOOL). And as many other former faded vixens of the past (see Ford comma Willa) can attest, Katy Perry won't be in the spotlight for very long.
031606792X|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book along with all of the other's in this series.  Was it my favorite, no, that would be Twilight.  But it still was a great book that was hard to put down.  A lot of readers on here claim it's too far fetched, a vampire pregnancy and Bella is no longer Bella when she turns.  But remember everybody, THIS IS FICTION!  That is what makes it believable.  If you want truth, than please don't read fiction.  I would recommend this to anyone and I, personally,  couldn't put it down.  As with every other book in this series, I wanted to get to the next chapter to see what would happen to Bella and Edward and the rest of the Cullen's.  Definetely recommended!!

0545128285|5.0|The book iteslf is written as a book of fables for young wizards and witches and so the tales themselves seem simple and straightforth. I was really excited to be able to read the full versions of stories hinted at in the HP series. The real treasure of this book, though, is Dumbledore's commentary on each story.  He analyzes the stories, makes humorous commments, and enlightens us to the \\"history\\" behind them.  This is a one sitting read.  Those who expected the length and details of the series may be a little let down but Rowling fans like me who just want another taste of the Herry Potter world will find this little volume charming.
0446615625|2.0|Well - i kept seeing these Baldacci books, and figured i'd give them a try. I started with the one, forget the title, where Stone teams up with the female who reunites with her father, who is being hunted by the casino boss guy...well, that was a solid book, so i thought i'd backtrack and read some earlier ones by Baldacci. The Simple Truth was also a worthy effort. But then, i read Camel Club - i was curious as to the origins of Oliver Stone and his little band of friends. This book was average. I'd give it 2.5 stars. The character Hemingway was interesting, but Stone/Carr was pretty dull. There are flashes of intrigue and great reading, but they are few and far between. I was also reading another book called Term Limits by Vince Flynn, and it's far superior.
B001F12J3Y|2.0|The movie is great, but the 3D effects are horrible. You see ghostly images and the 3D aspects have no depth. I EMAILED WARNERBROS ABOUT OFFERING A REPLACEMENT DISC AFTER THE PROBLEM GETS FIX. EVERYONE DO THE SAME. LET THEM KNOW WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE DISC AND MAYBE THEY WILL DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!
B000JLSM00|5.0|First of all ,the Movie is a Masterpiece ..but better than that is the transfer to Blu-ray ...the Scenery in Monument Valley is Simply Breathtaking ,the Definition ,the Clarity is STUNNING ,WATCH THIS MOVIE AND YOU WILL BE AMAZED...The Acting by ALL especially WAYNE is Wonderful ,this is in my TOP FIVE Movies of all Time.
B00006AFF5|5.0|I think the film version of the Grinch is just as good as the cartoon and book. Jim Carrey did an awesome job! I love the Grinch's backstory about why he hated Christmas. When Cindy Lou Who invites him to be the \\"Holiday Cheermeister\\" of the one-thousandth Who-Bilation, the Grinch goes and starts to have a good time, but the mayor brings something up in the Grinch's childhood that pisses him off. Later, the Grinch decides to go back to Who-Ville and steal their presents dressed as Santa Claus. Will the Grinch realize the error of his ways and learn the true meaning of Christmas? I highly recommend DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS!!!

B0000069CT|5.0|A week ago, I knew nothing about Max Bruch, until I came across a video of Itzhak Perlman playing VC #1. I was astonished by it. I own Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Paganini, and a few other composers VC's, but Bruch's made me go WOW!! Granted this performance is by Accardo, and after purchasing and listening to this CD, I consider Perlman and Accardo of equal talent. I have always opted for complete works by a top-grade artist-Accardo, such as this CD, rather than piece mealing my collection on a per performance per piece manner as with Perlman. One last note about Accardo, I am not sure if he plays on a strat, but if does he, the tone, range, and dynamics of his instrument are unsurpassed. All that said coupled with his unbelievable ability make him really difficult to beat.<br /><br />VC#1-I love a few romantic period composers, Beethoven, Paganini, Chopin, Mendelssohn and Dvorak. This VC has to be at the top of my all-time great list. Such sentiment, power, romance, and beauty, it leaves me speechless. How could one come up with such a great piece? Well, the CD leaflet notes explain. Bruch collaborated with a premier violinist, Joachim, who helped him rewrite the concerto. It's a masterpiece in a violinst's mind. What a unique approach to composition. Bravo-Bruch...<br /><br />VC#2-Is a great work; the adagio is very touching and heartfelt. Bruch definitely has an exceptional way of writing slow mvt.s and Accardo has an exceptional way of playing them, maybe the best.<br /><br />VC#3-I really enjoy this VC, maybe as much as VC#1. It begins with a very poignant first movement-Allegro energico. The violin passages are very well versed and the theme is repeated by the soloist. The adagio movement is very good and has a very beautiful theme to it. The last movement is not as powerful as the first, but is more joyful and likable. Accardo's playing is just spectactular!<br /><br />Anyone who is interested in romantic period violin this CD is a must. Bruch's VC's are as Romantic as you can get.mantic as you can get.
B000WQW988|5.0|I honestly think this is the best musical show I've ever seen. This, not really being a concert, but a great performance. Its a must own for any Nirvana fan. Youll really fall in love with it once you either watch it or hear it. There's plenty of funny things that are said in between songs too
B0016PM722|5.0|I have been searching and shopping for the Force FX Lightsabers for quite some time and i finally broke down and bought 4 of them. This was my second one I bought. I first received the Master Replicas Vader one, which is amazing, and suprisingly this one holds its own against that. The Anakin one is far brighter, because red is a dark color anyway. And the hilt is metal and not too heavy. The only thing that bothered me is that the hilt is the same design as the luke skywalker one, but the picture shows it was different. I wouldnt have ordered the Master Replicas Luke one if i knew it was the same hilt. So now ill have two that look exactly the same. But I love these things so im sure ill get over it. This things really do add to a great collection.
0596007124|5.0|This is an excellent book for learning design patterns.  A word of warning; this is not a reference book!  It is well written and easy to understand with uncomplicated examples.  The innovative learning techniques are a defiant plus and are very helpful in retaining the material.
0316017922|4.0|Fascinating, and not at all what I expected.  Should give many successful people pause.      The take-home is on page 267, \\"It is not the brightest who succeed.  ...  Nor is success simply the sum of the decisions and efforts we make on our own behalf.  It is, rather, a gift.\\"    The book's interesting stories, backed up with lots of data, lead you to this conclusion, before the author even has to make it.
B000002ORL|5.0|I absolutely love this movie!! I just saw the play again at the Cadillac Theater in Chicago with Ted Neeley. Awesome!  The music is just beautiful.  I have been enjoying it every morning while I am getting dress for work since it is being shown on demand! I never tire of it...the more you listen to the words the more they make sense. Now I can listen to the sound track at work.

B000GPIPSS|5.0|Guess who's a scarier actor than Bela Lugosi?  Dwight Frye.  I saw this when I was a little kid and I didn't even notice Mr. Lugosi.  For all I cared, they could have cast Chico Marx or Lou Costello in the title role.  I'm still having nightmares about the entymophage, his eyes protruding like Peter Lorre's, pleading for mercy in his husky falsetto.
0545128285|2.0|Tales are fun, but not amazing.  The magic of the old harry potter books are missing here
B001JNNDBA|4.0|I love this movie, I love the theatrical version, but I really love the Director's Cut!  I am disappointed that the Blu-Ray release does not have the longer version on it, which I feel is a much more complete movie.
B0011NVC98|4.0|For an animated movie, this was a remarkable film. It tells the story of Beowulf in dramatic fashion and I appreciated seeing this classic tale, that I have often heard referenced indirectly but had never read. It makes one appreciate heroic, Nordic story telling, with it's many monsters and ironies.      Animated charaters in a drama takes a little getting used to, especially with the celebrity actor voice-overs. The facial expressions are still not quite what we expect from humans, but they are getting closer every year.
B0011TMGKG|5.0|I got this toy for my son when he was about 10 wks old and discovering his hands... I thought the big eyes would be appealing and he could learn to grab onto the rings. He loves it so much, it really helped him build his hand-eye coordination by grabbing the rings, and he just loves to stare at the lion. It makes the coolest \\"purring\\" sound when you move it too, he loves that as well. Highly recommended!
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie. Ok, so maybe it wasn't the best singing at times, but it looked like everyone was having a great time and I had a great time watching it. It was a nice fun break in the middle of all these bad times. I can't wait to see it again.
B000BZIT5M|5.0|THIS IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS. BRIAN LARGE DOES A SUPERB DIRECTING JOB IN A 1982 COVENT GARDEN LA BOHEME WHICH BRINGS TOGETHER AS GOOD A GROUP OF SINGING ACTORS AS ONE WILL FIND WITHIN PERFECTLY DESIGNED SETS TO MAKE FOR AN OPERA IN WHICH EVERY MOMENT IS ALIVE WITH THE APPROPRIATE EMOTIONS. IT WOULD BE PILING IT ON, SO TO SPEAK, TO DETAIL THE STRENGTHS OF EACH PARTICIPANT BUT ONE MUST MENTION THAT ILEANA COTRUBAS MAKES EVERY WORD, SPOKEN AND SUNG, AN INTIMATE PART OF HER CHARACTERIZATION, NEIL SHICOFF, THEN QUITE NEW TO THE OPERA GAME, USES HIS VOICE BEAUTIFULLY TO CREATE VOCAL CHARACTER RATHER THAN SIMPLE GYMNASTICS, MARILYN ZSCHAU, FULFILLS THE VERY DIFFICULT ROLE REQUIREMENT THAT MUSETTA BE A COQUETTE WITH A HEART OF GOLD, AND, SO FOR EACH, ACTING AND SINGING ARE MARRIED TO A DEGREE ONLY FOUND AMONG THE BEST PRODUCTIONS. IT IS A LESSON IN WHAT WE MEAN BY MODERN OPERA, WHETHER FANTASY OR REALISM, EVERY EXPRESSION OF MUSIC, SONG, PHYSICAL MOVEMENT, SETTING IS HARMONIZED TO FURTHER APPREHENSION AND APPRECIATION OF THE OPERA'S UNDERLYING THEME, ITS REASON FOR BEING, ITS ELAN VITAL.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR THE BEGINNING AND THE VETERAN OPERA LOVER.
0786948523|4.0|4th edition is bound to be regarded as the love-child of collectible card games and online RPGs. And no book displays this feeling any stronger than its 4th edition Monster's Manual. I've been playing dnd since 2nd edition came out and did a lot of DMing during 3rd edition. In those times you would create a monster in a way very similar to a PC: You would choose your monster's race, give it a class and choose its feats and spells before you were done. The whole system was incredibly powerful to the point of being overwhelming. 4th edition changed all of this. Monsters now are presented \\"as-is\\", no tweaking necessary. You can't trace how many levels it has or what feat choices it took. It is basically a non-adaptable stat block. This, of course has its upsides. In 3rd, for example, between feats, spells and abilities, a normal adult dragon would have around 30 different options during combat. In 4th? Even the most powerful has about 7. And most of them are pretty linear. Of course, you can't level it up to scale the encounter to your group's level or even choose to give it different abilities (some monster templates are presented though) but it does make it a lot easier just to put one out of the book and into the battlefield. In the end, it seems monsters and enemy NPCs work in ways very different from normal PCs. They have a lot less options, a lot less depth and no way to scale. However they do look a lot user-friendlier, with a simpler, cleaner stat-block and easier to understand powers.<br /> Bottom line, the question comes down to the Player's Handbook. If DM and players like this novel approach to dnd then the Monster's Manual follows suit and delivers a good, solid work for the busy DM. If the whole cRPG / CCG look doesn't strike your fancy, I seriously think this book won't convert you.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I'm a bit surprised too at some of these reviews.  I know, as a TV product, it's commercial can be a bit deceptive.  If you think this is going to replace a sweeper you use over your WHOLE house, forget it.  If you're using it that way, yeah, you probably will burn out a charge faster than you can believe.  That's not what this is for.  The Swivel Sweeper is for LIGHT MESSES.  We live in an apartment and use this every day for quick cleaning.  For this, it's incredible.  It picks up items quickly, rarely needs cleaning, and makes going over everything with a vacuum unnecessary except for big cleaning days.  I've had no technical problems with it at all.  I cleaned out the brushes for the first time in six months of use, and even then it was working fine before I did it.  At times, yes, it did push around some of the dirt, but since it swivels, all I do is turn the handle and the header moves around in a circle, catching whatever problem I may have.  Occasionally there may be a few heavier pieces here and there in a corner that I can't get with it, but it does its job just fine.  I spot clean with it all over the place, perfect for when people drop by unexpectedly and there may be some crumbs lying about.  I really don't have any problems with this item at all.  If you're looking for a way to eliminate a dust pan, I think it's great.  Looking to eliminate a vacuum, NO WAY.  Prehaps I'm just lucky with it.

B00005CDNK|5.0|The editorial review of this album stated that this doesn't sound like an album by a group on the way out. He was right, it sounds like ANYTHING but a group calling it quits. I think the reason for this is that ABBA did intend to record an album after The Vistors but opted instead for a break which, unfortunately, turned into a permanent one.  I believe some of the bonus songs were recorded for inclusion in the next album, if I'm not mistaken. I never saw ABBA in concert, much to my dismay, but the music is still there, and we are much the better for it. Voulez Vous was a more or less disco type album , and even though it isn't bad, contained a bit too much disco for my taste. Souper Trouper was much better, and a little more light hearted than the Visitors, but Vistors will always be my favorite. When All is Said and Done is a wonderful song, and although it's most likely a song about the break up of a relationship, could also be a song about simply growing older. To me it says \\"It's been a great ride, but what the hell, life isn't over yet.\\"  There are many more great songs on this album, but don't listen to me...buy the Visitors and all the other ABBA albums and hear for yourself.  Even though this one has a somber tone to it, it really doesn't detract from the greatness of the songs. Life has many sides, many moods, and you need music that represents all sides. Get The Visitors. You'll not be sorry.
B001ECQ75A|1.0|We rented this to watch as a family, after hearing so much \\"buzz\\" about it.  The animation is amazing in parts, there are a few funny moments, and a couple of lines with half-decent, shallow messages.    Overall, however, we were very disappointed in the film.    First, the film is extremely violent.  While the action attempts to be slap-sticky in parts, it is nothing like the old Road Runner and Wiley Coyote scenes.  The fighting is VERY intense (as well as the accompanying audio), and the characters are outright vicious.  The \\"bad-guy\\" character will give small children nightmares.  You watch the characters ruthlessly kill each other over and over again (or, at least they would die from such violent acts if only they weren't animated characters).  On a scale from road runner to Terminator, the action leans far toward the latter.  I can't imagine a responsible parent using this film to babysit a young child.  Frankly, we didn't really like the message of the movie either.  It attempts to convey the message of \\"just believe in yourself and you'll fulfill your destiny.\\"  That's fine and dandy, but the panda is depicted as being dishonest, lazy, unintelligent, goofy, and given to bad habits (binge-eating).  His eating disorder is used by his trainer as motivation for some brief martial arts training, and voila, he beats the great enemy of the people in all-out mortal combat.   I would rather have seen a message of integrity, hard work, sacrifice, and courage.  IF the message of this film were true, I could vegitate in front of a wii and eat chips all day and turn into a Ghandi or General Washington with almost no effort on my part.   There are plenty of exciting, adventurous, meaningful and truly inspiring films out there.  Keep looking, because this film is just another course of the usual fare of empty calories, and leaves much to be desired.
0385339100|3.0|Fast paced, highly entertaining, believable characters, good dialogue, well thought out story. Grisham has such a masterful mind. I enjoyed this book very much.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Just one thing bugs about this movie: The \\"super scary\\" Batman voice employed in Batman Begins during the \\"everybody is freaking out because of scarecrow's gas\\" scenes is now the standard batman voice throughout the sequel.    It's too over the top and makes Bale's performance the least enjoyable of the big 3 in this film.    Other than that this film rocks
B001H5X7JS|5.0|By far the most hilarious movie of 2008 and so politically incorrect but it was made to make fun of actors who do certain movies to get recognition from their peers. I couldn't stop laughing it was just too much.     Great buy

B0015I2P0Y|5.0|If you've read the other reviews here, you can see that it's nearly criminal that Elbow gets little attention on this side (US) of the Atlantic.  On the other hand, it's always nice to have our little musical secrets.  It's always a bummer when your secret band gets too big and everyone \\"loved them for years...\\"    Elbow is often compared to Radiohead and Coldplay, and although there are some commonalities musically, on the emotional scale Elbow leaves them both, and most other bands, in the dust.  Guy Garvey's lyrics and vocals evoke emotions in a REAL, heartfelt way.  I don't ever feel as if he's going through the motions.  Each line comes, really comes, from his heart.  Mirrorball, track 3, is a perfect example.  Beyond the great lyrics and singing, Elbow is a band of flawless musicians as well.  Creativity and uniqueness abound.    There's not a weak song on this CD, but the outstanding tracks are Starlings, Weather To Fly, The Bones of You, and the above-mentioned Mirrorball.  One Day Like This is an effortless anthem on the scale of U2, yet less self-conscious.      Elbow delivers live as well.  I saw them in May 08 when they played the Showbox in Seattle.  Guy is an excellent frontman and had the crowd eating from his hands.  His \\"cheers\\" at the conclusion of remarks between each song must have sent bar sales through the roof that night. :-)  Although I would like them to get more attention, sales, and respect, I must admit I enjoy being able to see them in small venues vs the larger auditoriums and festivals they play in Europe.      I digress, however.  Try out this CD, and give their back catalog a listen as well.  You'll be amazed at what's been under your radar all these years.

B000022TSW|5.0|South Park is my favorite TV show and this movie arived very fast. thank you so much
B000WGWQG8|5.0|The cinematography alone makes this sumptuously filmed series worth watching. The acting is very well done, in particular, Laura Linney's amazing performance as Abigail Adams. She does a superb job creating a compelling central character in a role that may have otherwise felt peripheral to a very male driven plot.     The cinematography is almost painterly in quality and the lighting is exquisite. Rarely do I look for cinematographer names in the credits but I found myself eager to learn more about Tak Fujimoto.
B000P0J0B0|3.0|Too many movies today lack effort and make up with special effects.  Natural Born Killers is the opposite it tries too hard to be the perfect movie that it tends to be over the top.  Just like a book there are the classics that you are forced to read and books that are shallow you want to read.  Natural Born Killers feels like it is forced on you and for overall art and effort it is worth 5 stars but for enjoyment and a movie that you want to keep turning to it is a 3 star movie.  I felt the movie had a tendency to drag on and in the end it was just too overbearing.

B0009WFF7M|5.0|Brothers in Arms is one of the greatest albums of all time. This edition kicks it up another notch. Over the years, since 1985, I have listened to this album on tape, LP, CD, MP3 and now in this super edition.     If this album does not give you the goose bumps with Money for Nothing, Ride Across the River, Man's too Strong and Brothers in Arms, I don't know what will.     To fully appreciate Dire Straits mastery, check out guitar playing book by Mark Knopfler and, of course other albums by Dire Straits. They are all amazing in their own right. You can also check out interviews with Mark Knopfler on YouTube. That will give you the goose bumps too, when you hear how he lets his guitar sing \\"because his voice goes only so far.\\"
B000002N1E|4.0|I have this album since it first came out to stores, that means a long long time ago...And I still love it and lisen it over and over... Some of my favorite songs are 319 and Bily Jack Bitch... The song of The most beautiful woman I just hated... What can I do? That is not the Prince that I like...I prefer the original Prince, more funky and with all his explicit lyrics... That was the magic, that was the key... Albums such as Purpule rain, 1999, Batman, the Black album (I think that is my favorite), Love Symbol, Parade Diamonds and Pearls... that is the good stuff, and The Gold Experience continue that... Is almost the end of the real Prince, the one that I really love...
B0011U5E1S|3.0|Only for diehard fans of the late grunge group Nirvana would this album since it includes an unreleased track called You Know Your Right which was the last track record by the group before Kurt's suicide in 1994. For only having 14 songs it should of had more like Negative Creep, Slappy, Scentless Apprentice, Drain You, Polly. The rest of the tracks on the album like In Bloom, Smells like teen spirit, Lithium, Rape me, Heartshape Box, About a girl, Been a son, all apologizes, the man who sold the world, pennyroyal tea can be found in Beach, Nevermind, and In Utero plus Unplugged album. There is no need for this album unless you want almost all of the hits with a few missing. It looks like Dave, Courtney, and Chris were just looking for a quick cash in and just throw this collection whoever did, I think it was Courtney mostly. It should of had videos or interview with Dave, Chris and former members of the band talking about Nirvana or at least live footage of the band.
0812580346|5.0|Robert J. Sawyer has been tabbed \\"the Canadien Michael Crichton\\" and this hefty praise is well-deserved.  He has been writing intelligent novels that are unfortunately relegated to the \\"Science Fiction\\" sections of most bookstores.  \\"Flashforward\\" is another example of just how genre-breaking he can be.    This sci-fi/thriller/murder mystery plays out like an extended episode of The Outer Limits.  Imagine if a super-conductor being operated at the CERN laboratory in Geneva actually causes the entire human race to experience two minuttes of their consciousness being transported 21 years into the future.  A neat idea that, in lesser hands, would have been given pulp treatment.  Sawyer deftly shows not only the brilliance of these visions but also the tragic results of all human activity coming to a halt for 2 minutes (countless tradgedies and disasters worldwide).  Also, not all governments and individuals are thrilled about the glimpse into the future and what it reveals to them.  Throw into the mix the fact that one of the CERN Physicists has no vision because he must not exist 21 years in the future - a fact proven by the hundreds of individuals who have visions that include the revalation that he was murdered a few days prior to the \\"flash forward\\".    This book is unputdownable (is there such a word?) and all the characters are well drawn out and interesting.  I look forward to the pilot that ABC is going to make on it and hope they do it justice.
B000WC3A0S|5.0|Being a big fan of the \\"Rocky\\" movies, I would highly recommend this set to anyone considering it. I would like to clairify a few things I was wondering about the set before I purchased it, and have since found out after I bought the set and watched all the movies.   -First off, all of the movies are anamorphic for 16X9 T.V. sets, in case anyone was concerned of the picture format like I was.   -Second, the extras on the dvds for the first 5 films are an original movie trailer for each, and some additional bonus material on \\"Rocky Balboa\\".   All-in-all, the set is a great buy and I feel a must have for any fan.

B001GJ3VYG|5.0|ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!  I thought Dido's first two albums were great but number three surpasses both.  Her voice is smooth and hauntingly beautiful.  The only complaint is the soft cover.  I was surprised since I saw the album in stores in a hard cover.  The cover tore when I took the cd out.  The 5 stars are totally for Dido's work.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|I've been most critical with Macca's last few releases and have to admit I stayed away from the previous Fireman projects because I just am not into dance and or techno music.    That being said...    This CD is brilliant. Crowded House's \\"Together Alone\\" CD which Youth produced is among one of my favorite CD's of all time due to the fact that it has a certain atomosphere in the production that lifts the songs above the norm. This is the case here and it lets Macca soar.    There's so much good stuff on here. Every track has something interesting about it. I love \\"Sing the Changes\\" \\"Highway\\" \\"Light From Your Lighthouse\\"  \\"Dance 'til We're High\\".     I'm very impressed with it all.     Good one Macca and Youth.
B001F9Y2CM|3.0|I have every single song recorded by ABBA, including the bootleg recordings of the rareties.  I understand the bootlegs will never make it to a compilation like this, but please, if your going to re release the same music at least give the true fans a bit more, like the rarely heard \\"On the Carousel\\" from The Album.  I have the full version and it is a great song.  There are so many rareties that have never been officially released in the U.S or Canada but have been found on imports from China, Turkey and even from Afghanistan.  These were official releases in those countries.  Universal should consider finding them, or asking the members of ABBA for permission to release them.  They might actually sell a few more million copies.  Otherwise this is just another greatest hits package.
B00129H7VS|5.0|First , let me say that I watched the original HBO series when it first aired in 2001. It began just after 9/11 and was especially gripping, partly due to the \\"mood\\" of the nation and the fear of what lay on the horizon. I became totally absorbed by the series and never missed an episode. When it was finally released on DVD, I gladly ran to the store and paid $120 for the set, and enjoyed it all over again.<br />When the Bluray was announced, I deliberated about the value of investing in the upgraded version. Most of the scenes are intentionally gritty, and all battle scenes have a choppy, grainy, scratched-film effect to them. I decided to rent the Bluray from Netflix, to see if it was worth the difference.<br />WOW! I never would have believed that Bluray sharpness and clarity could add so much to a film shot with so many intentional shortcomings. I'm now on disc 2, and the set has been added to the top of my Christmas wish list, highest priority.<br />One thing I noticed immediately, the increased detail adds more emotional contrast between the battle scenes and the shots of the calm, beautiful landscapes and villages. Also, the facial expressions are also more intense. Finally, the horror of war is even more gruesome. It's like seeing the movie for the first time, all over again. To me, that is the true mark of a great Bluray. Enjoy, I will. I'll wait and review the audio after I receive my 5.1 headphones...
B00005JPNY|1.0|I was disappointed compared to all the hype I heard before I watched this movie. Just another fantasy movie, nothing to jump up and down about. Good acting and special affects but that's all it has going for it.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Who ever thought we'd be routing FOR a serial killer?!  Can't miss an episode ... and viewing each season is worth repeating.  Michael C. Hall is superb as the ever-expanding multi-dimensional Dexter!
B001ECQ75A|4.0|This movie is packed with fun filled excitement for the whole family.  I think I was more entertained then my kids.  The movie has a diabolical twist to learning how to believe in your dreams.  It is really a must see for the family.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This movie is catchy, yet cheesy. I found myself humming the songs long after I had stopped rewatching it, and had my ringtone set as one of the bits. A wonderful work, and I'll be ordering this soon.
0060765380|5.0|I enjoyed all of his books.  He's one of the few authors whose books I would buy and recommend on name, alone.
0316017922|4.0|I found Outliers to be an interesting read and Gladwell does a good job of linking events and stories together to show that success is based on more than just natural talents. However, the book doesn't offer new or original ideas. The most interesting aspects of the book revolved around the stories of how hard work and opportunities helped the Beatles, Bill Gates, and other successful people. The chapter about math students from Asia and the discussion about language/cultural differences was interesting as well. The downside was that he delved too much into the flight error chapter and the final chapter discussing race in Jamaica seemed out of place. Overall, it was a good effort but I finished the book a little disappointed.
B000059T00|4.0|The best 2/3 of Cream and the best half of Traffic. A short-lived super group that everyone should hear. I lost my vinyl in the 90's. It is good to have my collection whole again.
0525950079|5.0|Just as good as Pillars of the earth.  What I liked about World without end is that you don't have to  both books to know what the story line is.  Great book to read.  Bought it for my son-n-law and he loved it.
B000053V7O|5.0|Round Midnight captures the life of a jazz musician perfectly. The late nights, fighting the post partum emptiness that follows a gig, the struggle to survive and keep one's body and soul together, the comeraderie that exists between the musicians. Everything was flawless.<br /><br />Dexter Gordon's performance was breathtaking. Here is everything every jazz musician faces, every demon that must be conqured.<br /><br />The music is a world in itself. The masters themselves playing their own music.<br /><br />The Francois character had his own demons too. He abandoned his wife, and nearly abandoned his daughter, to chase his own muse that came to him in the form of the music and the people who played it. He took Gordon's character in so that he could repay the debt. And yet there was always an area of the musician's world he could only look at and never enter. He was an outsider that had been accepted by that tribe because of his love for one of their own. But he would never be one of them.<br /><br />The movie is sad and joyful, tragic and beautiful, desolate and bountiful.
B0017R5UAA|1.0|Sounds like a My Morning Jacket reject.    Check out Lost in the Woods or Horse Feathers instead.
B000002ADT|1.0|First, let me start off by stating that my field of musical interest and knowledge is Country Blues. By \\"Country Blues\\", I mean Blind Willie McTell, Willie Walker, Richard \\"Rabbit\\" Brown, Charley Patton, Johnny Shines, Memphis Minnie, Son House, Lonnie Johnson, and that man who has already received way too much press at the expense of others, Robert Johnson. As far as Jazz music, I have many recordings by Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Johnny Dodds, Jimmie Noone, Billie Holiday, Django Reinhardt, Coleman Hawkins, and the man whom I consider to be the greatest of the early Jazz composers, Jelly Roll Morton.  I have tried, time after time, to listen to John Coltrane's \\"Giant Steps\\" and this particular Miles Davis record, \\"Kind of Blue\\". Aside from \\"Blue In Green\\", there is nothing on this disc that I find of value. Many will surely tear me apart, stating that I know nothing of musical notation, composition or theory, and that Modal Jazz was an extremely important movement or \\"discovery\\" in Jazz music. However, we are not mathematicians; we are music fans. There is nothing on this record which I can relate to emotionally, aside from \\"Blue In Green\\", which is decent. Nothing on this record even comes remotely close (and that's an understatement) to competing with Louis Armstrong's \\"West End Blues\\", Jelly Roll Morton's \\"Deep Creek\\", Duke Ellington's \\"Black Beauty\\", Django Reinhardt's \\"Minor Swing\\" or his version of the standard, \\"Moonglow.\\" The music on this record is empty of feeling and Davis' trumpet playing is frankly annoying and irritating. All of the music on this record, aside from, perhaps, \\"Blue In Green\\", simply meanders and is only of value to people who spend more time relating to musical theory and the notion of Modal Jazz than to the actual quality of music. I'd sincerely love to know how listening to this album fills one with a feeling of commiseration or moves one emotionally. To me, this is stone cold boring.    I'd imagine that the majority of peoplewho'd say that a Country Blues fan has no clue about Modal Jazz would also think that Blues is simplistic music and is inferior to Jazz. To those people, I would direct them to the 1931 recordings of Skip James, various Blind Blake and Blind Lemon Jefferson recordings, the brilliance of the Reverend Gary Davis, the incredible playing displayed by the little-known Willie Walker, the poly-rhythms played by Charley Patton, the slide mastery of Johnny Shines on songs such as \\"The Devil's Daughter\\", and the hypnotic, other-worldly tone of Fred McDowell's slide playing. After listening to the aforementioned Blues recordings (the guitar playing, the passionate vocals, and the poetry which Bob Dylan so admires), I challenge any champion of \\"Kind of Blue\\" to tell me that Miles' exercise in putting people to sleep has the same vitality, sexuality and brilliance of a McDowell, Patton, Skip James, etc.  Simply put, this album is atrociously overrated and does not compare at all with New Orleans Jazz or the many great masterpieces by Django Reinhardt. I do not want to hear about Davis and Armstrong not being comparable because their music is so different, because that is simply nonsense. Music is music, and should not be reduced to over-intellectualizing. Even musicologists, who know more about music than we will ever know, were not drawn to Blues, Jazz or any other field of music because they wanted to debate technicalities. Instead, they were shocked and in awe the first time they heard a work by Beethoven or Louis Armstrong, because it gave them a rush, not dissimilar from taking a powerful hallucinogenic drug. In conclusion, avoid this album like the plague, and go out and buy some early Louis Armstrong, anything by Django Reinhardt, or, if you want Jazz recordings with better sound quality (which do not endlessly meander like Miles Davis' music does), pick up some later-period Coleman Hawkins.
B000006XDX|4.0|Great to hear Andy hook up with a couple of the pilot guys on this album. As others have mentioned Heroes is one of the strongest tracks but I think the whole album has many great moments. Lullabye is short but very sweet, one of my favourite melodies and vocals from Andy. I think its unfair to compare this with the bands earlier works as this is a soft rock album and a good one at that.
B00013RC8O|5.0|Don't get wrong : this is not a fantastic car chase movie. It's a movie from the early seventies about freedom, about America living the end of a golden age, about a country made of hope and contradictions. It is also about space, and time, about beauty (the desert is amazingly beautyful).  R. Sarafian is a great director, with very little he does big effect, and Barry Newman is exactly the guy requested for this role.  Besides, it is a fantastic car chase movie.
B000002L9W|5.0|The first Roth CD is the best. It is almost as good as Van Halen. Buy it now!
B00007LVBQ|4.0|This was one of the best albums of 1991, at least as rated by the critics. The music represents a breathtaking array of influences, styles and textures that is well enough integrated for a cohesive musical statement. Movin' On Up is a soulful slab of rock with lovely female vocals, whilst the next two are psychedelic trance-dance pieces. Slip Inside This House being more straight-forward tribal dance & Don't Fight It Feel It being a trippy, trancey number with quirky burbling synths.<br /><br />Higher Than The Sun is a slower number with atmospheric soundscapes whilst Inner Flight has an even slower tempo and more ambient feel with some dreamy vocals. Come Together is a mid tempo rhythmic track built around a male vocal speech followed later by oneiric female vocals. The tribal rhythms reappear on the long track Loaded with its mildly amusing spoken intro, appealing melody line, voice samples and bursts of sound. A drastic change in sound and tempo comes with the gentle ballad Damaged, firmly in the rock tradition with great guitars and sensitive piano.<br /><br />The next track, I'm Coming Down, is even slower and more laid-back with mournful sax, an apt description of the process named in the title. The penultimate track, Higher Than The Sun: A Dub Symphony, contains more atmospheric sounds & spacious vocals than the earlier version, and the album concludes with Shine Like Stars, a shimmering slow psychedelic number.<br /><br />It's tempting to compare this album with psychedelic masterpieces from the past, like Love's [[ASIN:B000058983 Forever Changes]], the 1960s psychedelia of the Stones, Beatles, Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix's [[ASIN:B000002P5U Electric Ladyland]]. Fans of Screamadelica ought to also investigate the work of the ambient tribal house UK band [[ASIN:B000025V9H Astralasia]].

It's for a Creative Writing Workshop that I will be leading in January and I wanted to have a copy to show how cheap one could get resource materials from Amazon!!  $1.92 plus shipping!!  Thanks for the opportunity for good books at inexpensive prices.  Veda
B001ED7C58|5.0|The cd isnt bad.  Not normally the music i listen to.  My favorite songs are Never Think by Rob Pattinson and Bella's Lullaby is beautiful.  Also the two songs by paramore arent too bad either. If your into Linkin Park and Muse then it's the cd for you but if not, or you just a fan, it's not a bad cd to own.  Overall im not disappointed with the cd.
B000N2HCM4|5.0|Now I think I understand where--and how-- Barack Obama gained both the knowledge and the wisdom to lead our country at this point in our history.  With sensitivity and insight, Obama guides the reader through many of the  often-amusing, sometimes-painful, episodes of his life.  From year to year, and from country to country, Obama searches for the elusive answers to questions that might help him to understand his identity.  As I followed Obama through his journey, I found myself hoping (and even praying) that this young man would be successful in his quest, mindful that the extent to which Obama was successful might very well impact his ability to guide the rest of us in our nation's search for our identity in this new millenium.  This a wonderfully entertaining and compelling read!
0739432141|4.0|I happened onto Richard Morgan's books by chance.  Good chance, I might add! Although the story would (if it were being rated)get an R for extreme violence, the ability to store consciousness and \\"re sleeve\\" that consciousness (in the event of death) in a body grown for special abilities suited for martial aptitude lets the author explore numerous,well written-if bizarre, story lines. For anyone who enjoys a unique experience (much like THE MATRIX did for film), don't miss reading this book.
0316010669|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell's \\"Blink\\" is an enjoyable read - I breezed right through it and found it to be a book that I would look forward to opening up. Gladwell does a masterful job of weaving together 3 or more points at the same time without losing the reader and frequently leaving me amazed at his organizational skills.<br /><br />That being said, does Blink get the job done? Does he prove his thesis about \\"The power of thinking without thinking\\"?  Yes and no. He starts out with a great example of a supposed piece of Greek art that may or may not be a real piece of ancient art. His thesis plays out well there, with his comments on why certain musicians make it and others don't and his comments on police and the need to think quickly are all strong.<br /><br />His arguments about Paul Van Riper and the war game he won, however, were more about the power of de-centralized decision-making versus centralized planning, in my opinion.  Nonetheless, it's a good read and well worth your time.
0345446798|5.0|I had farm dogs for many years - no leashes - just the basic training of manners. I have read many books over the years on dog training, but now I am in a whole new realm.  I am living in the city with a dog I adopted from a local shelter, and have been reading more advanced approaches to training and behaviors,therapy dog training and use, etc., and have learned something from each book.  It has been an adventure navigating from novice city dog owner (how to hold the leash, 'heel', greeting other dogs) to really understanding in depth what the relationship can be ideally between human and dog. The part about our body signals to our dogs was helpful, even though I knew some of it by experience - hat means going outside - the author took it to a much deeper level, and I am using body language in more advanced ways, whether in play or in training.    I found this book just at the perfect time for what I needed to learn to go even further in making my amazing dog be the best she can be!  Have read other books by Patricia McConnell which were excellent also, and alerted my local librarian to her books, especially for new owners. It covers everything from puppies to senior dogs and even rehoming if necessary.  Most helpful book ever!!  (Just a note about another book I'd recommend..'The Loved Dog' by Tamar Geller. Somewhat different approaches, but both about the great love and connection with your dog)
386521584X|5.0|Robert Frank´s \\"The Americans\\" is a great lesson in documentary photography - the images transport you to the moment, making you part of what is happening, as an observer. Robert Frank even lets the subject realize his presence by direct eye contact, letting the viewer know S/he is also being observed. I like his breaking of symmetry of lines, creating tension in his compositions, making us ask questions, search for answers about the image. A great book!
0545128285|4.0|I knew it wouldn't take long for J.K. Rowling to produce some other book related to her bestselling \\"Harry Potter\\" series.<br /><br />Admittedly the main link (aside from an important appearance in Rowling's prior novel) is that the \\"The Tales of Beedle The Bard\\" are all given a hefty postscript by the late Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of Rowling's fictional magic academy. It's a very quick children's book with some old-fashioned fairy tales in the Brothers Grimm mold, and a slightly tongue-in-cheek (but overly long) examinations afterward.<br /><br />First there's the tale of an extraordinarily selfish young wizard, whose father bequeaths him a cauldron and a slipper. When the wizard refuses to help the local Muggles, the cauldron suddenly sprouts a brass foot and starts pursuing him, making his life a living hell until he starts helping people other than himself.<br /><br />Then three young witches are attempting to get to the Fountain of Fair Fortune -- one is seriously ill, one is poor, and one got dumped. They end up accompanied by an extremely unlucky knight, and they are forced to handle three obstacles before they can get to the fountain.<br /><br />Then it's a somewhat darker tale about a warlock who lives alone because he cares nothing for anyone, until a visitor bruises his ego by suggesting that he can't get a wife -- leading him to pursue a sweet, wealthy and gorgeous young woman. But she is frightened by the warlock's heartless nature -- and when he reveals his \\"treasure\\" to her, tragic consequences ensue.<br /><br />There's a tale about a king who tries to gain control of all his kingdom's magic, capturing all the witches and trying to learn magic himself. His instructor is nothing but a greedy faker, who quickly enters into a minor war with the king's washerwoman Babbitty -- who may be an actual witch. Finally, the story of three brothers offered three gifts by Death -- who, of course, has an ulterior motive. Don't they always?<br /><br />For the record, \\"The Tales of Beedle the Bard\\" is a very short book -- only about a hundred shortish pages long. Unlike the bestselling \\"Harry Potter\\" series (where \\"Tales of Beedle the Bard\\" apparently took on a pivotal role) this book is clearly for children -- especially since each one is a clear moral message. An adult or older kid will probably blow through this book in half an hour, maximum.<br /><br />And at least half of that is made up of the preface (explaining the fictional history of the stories -- including that this is a new translation by Hermione Granger) and the quirky analyses (apparently by Albus Dumbledore). In fact, too much space is taken up by the analyses, although they are cleverly written and have a touch of satire (such as the account of someone trying to \\"clean up\\" the tales, with nauseating results).<br /><br />And J.K. Rowling's slightly tongue-in-cheek prose and sprightly imagination work well with the fairy tale format. She gives the stories some nicely gruesome imagery (the twisted, hair-covered heart) and a medieval flavour with tiny rural villages, magical quests, kings, knights, a deathly psychopomp and a sprightly witchy washerwoman who's far cleverer than anyone expects. And though witches and wizards come into play during the stories, the focus is on their personalities and trials rather than their magic.<br /><br />J.K. Rowling's \\"Tales of Beedle the Bard\\" is way too short, but her fairy tales are clever and well-written, and the afterwords are even cleverer.ort book -- only about a hundred shortish pages long.

0545128285|2.0|I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series and felt really let down by this book.  It is so short and feels like hardly any effort was put into it - I read it in an hour and came away feeling like I wasted that hour of my life.  The stories aren't imaginative of interesting at all.  Pretty lame to tell you the truth.  And definitely not for younger kids.  Ugh...I guess Rowling is at the point where she is so rich and famous, that she can publish mediocre (or even worse) work from now on...sad...
B001EYGOEM|4.0|I think if you're expecting powerhouse vocals ala Carrie Underwood, you'll be disappointed. But I LOVE this album and I will tell you why. Taylor Swift is extremely talented. Her voice is simple and sweet, and yes, while she may benefit from voice lessons (as some have claimed), or just some maturity in years, it doesn't matter. She is a talented songwriter and musician which is more than we can say for 90% of the artists out there now. Her music is honest, catchy and fun. And no I am not 15, or even 18- I'm 27 and I still love this cd. I am not a huge fan of country either but Taylor Swift has converted me! This is one of the few country CDs I own but I think if you like Love Story and any of her other hits from her first CD you will definitely appreciate this album. It's been in my CD player for 1 week straight!
B00005JKHN|5.0|I have been buying Disney DVDs for awhile, every time they release one since they are often for a limited time, even if my child is not quite old enough for some of the titles, and I may hold onto this one just a bit.<br /><br />That being said this is a great version of the classic, the DVD is absolutlty beautiful and looks great on a 32\\" LCD television.
B001ER4CNY|1.0|TV show of \\"I Dream of Jeannie\\" was great and it still is one of my favorite TV series of all time, but I am very deeply disappointed that there is no English subtitle nor closed caption neither.  How couldn't video company neglect our educational needs such as English subtitle?  We suggest you to avoid this product for two major reasons: 1) no English subtitle/no closed caption and 2) there is no list of episodes in this product - that made me difficult to find which episodes and so, I had to look on DVD plate info.  There was no real Jeannie bottle in this product which it said \\"Jeannie bottle included\\" and it turned out to a pink cardboard bottle of Jeannie bottle - a gimmick.
B000HIVIOW|1.0|This DVD of The Snowman was advertised as David Bowie, narrator.  He does not appear on this DVD.  I was very disappointed!  This is an example of false advertising.  I have been a loyal customer at Amazon for many years, I ordered this version especially because it claimed to have David Bowie as narrator.
B001CTA1RK|3.0|The first Transporter movie was great. The action sequences were amazing, and it made Jason Statham a true action star. Then the second one came along and we had the racing scenes twist reality a little too far (flipping a car in mid-air so a bomb on the bottom can be snatched off by a conveniently located crane hook?). Now this third installment of the series comes along and we are shown just how far you can twist things. Sink your car in the bottom of a lake, deflate its tires, then pull it out and see if you can just drive it off. Not bloody likely.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, Jason is every bit the action star. When the fight scenes start, I think he does a great job. I say \\"I think\\" because the POV on the camera changes literally every 2 seconds when a fight scene starts so you have trouble keeping up with anything happening. I have no idea why they would go to such trouble to choreograph a fight scene and then make it impossible to tell what is going on in the process.<br /><br />Statham is an awesome fighter and has the dark charisma that makes it fun to watch, but it's a shame this particular franchise keeps falling further and further into the absurd. If they do make a Transporter 4 (and with a different director, I wouldn't mind if they did), I hope they simply make it fighting and racing--no magic driving off bridges onto moving trains and junk like that.<br /><br />This one is all right to see, but I can't recommend it too highly. The first remains the best.
0060974176|5.0|I first read this books several years ago.  Recent events caused me to pick it up again.  The author compares Toyota with other American and European car companies.  I is pretty clear why they are in trouble.  The domestic car industry peaked in 1955 and has been on a roller coaster ride since then.  If you also read Lee Iococca's recent book you get a clear picture of how out of touch the big three executives really are.
B0018JKLU6|5.0|I cannot speak for the blu-ray version and any features, but the movie itself is pretty good and definitely worth watching. The movie is based on true events in the life of the real Erin Brokovich and is your basic impossible underdog triumphs over unbeatable law machine.    I would rate the movie 4 stars, but I'm giving it 5 to help offset the bozos who seem to think this is a public forum to air their complaints about pricing and the economy and gave it only 1 star.

0956010903|5.0|I was thrilled on Thursday to have received in the mail my copy of the collector's edition of JK Rowling's Tales of Beedle the Bard.  It was shipped well in a doubled up cardboard box that fit it perfectly (actually had the name of the book on the box, so it was made specifically to ship this book.  When you open it, it's in a thin white cardboard cover that says \\"this side up\\"<br /><br />When you slip it out of that cover, you see a wonderful fake leather \\"book\\"  that is about 10 1/4 x 12 1/4 x 2 3/4 inches.  The binding has the name, author and small drawing in gold lettering; the front cover is the name, author and decorative drawn border pressed into the faux leather.  The back cover has part of the same drawing pressed in.<br /><br />When you open it up, you find that it's a case for the actual book that is imbedded into the middle, covered in a lovely red velvet bag with JK Rowling's signature embroidered in gold.  The draw strings are also gold.  On the left side there is a folder with Collector's Edition Prints.  They are beautiful, and can either be framed, or kept tucked away in this case.<br /><br />The actual book it's self is great quality.  Dark brown, with silver decorative pieces on top each piece having emerald colored stones in them.  This includes the side clasp. There is also an emerald colored ribbon bookmark.<br /><br />The introduction is a straight copied from JK's original work that Amazon purchased.  If you're not the best with handwriting, some words can be a little hard to read.  After the intro, it switches to a very Harry potter/magic like font that works well with telling the stories.  All together with the stories, Dumbledore's comments, and JK's comments, it took me about an hour to read straight through.<br /><br />This edition was worth every penny for someone who really loves Harry Potter, and wants quality.
0385338732|5.0|One minute Lexi Smart is standing in the rain in boots that are too small trying to hail a cab after being stood up by Loser Dave and the next thing she knows she's waking up in the hospital with a killer headache and a killer, drop dead gorgeous husband and she can't remember any of it. Has she woken into an alternate universe? Now Lexi has to try and remember the life she can't imagine herself having. In other words she has to come to terms with the fact that she is wealthy, has a great job, carries designer bags and has a new set of friends she cannot understand. And then she meets her husband's co-worker Jon and there is a glimmer of recognition but only a glimmer. Is she ever going to get her memory back and when exactly will she feel like she's wearing the right life and not a pinching too small a boot life?<br /><br />Ms. Kinsella has done it again. I can honestly say I'm not a huge fan of chick-lit but Ms. Kinsella is an author I'll automatically pick up. REMEMBER ME does not offer a new storyline but the author makes it fresh and entertaining with her use of characterization and her trademark wit. Lexi is a larger than life character and the reader will be engaged from the first page. There are plenty of laughs out loud moments; times where you sigh with understanding and you might just tear up a time or two as well. For a page-turning good time look no further.

B0016Q2D5M|5.0|Don't try to play this on an old fashioned CRT TV set - it won't work and will give you a headache.<br /><br />BUT..<br /><br />Put this DVD in your COMPUTER's DVD Player and get ready to be blown away.  I upgraded monitors and both worked perfectly.  My LCD HDTV would have worked better and be bigger, but I never got the colors to match up as perfectly as they did on my Computer's WS LCD (Media Center 2005).  You get 4 pair of Red-Blue glasses, which, although, sometimes one would wish that the Set Directors would have chosen better set and costume colors for this Anaglyph version of the 3-D Polarized version that was shown in Theatres, the effect is surprisingly viewable for those who don't mind getting a headache from focusing on things as the scene changes.<br /><br />This should be a wake up call to all those 3-D movies that were released in Theatre's in the 50s.  \\"Creature from the Black Lagoon\\" would be stunning.  MORE 3-D, MORE 3-D~!
B000AA305M|5.0|You people are incredibly idiotic if you seriously rated this album 1 star for it's label's feeble attempt at copyright protection! What in the hell does that seriously matter?!?! Please, David Gray is an incredible artist and this album is a masterpiece that does not deserve to sit under a sub-par rating only because it has copyright protection up the yin-yang.  Seriously, please listen to this fantastic album...to any DG fan out there, forget what all these fools have led you to believe, buy this album as it stands up there with the rest of his catalog.
B000002LSV|3.0|When ZZ Top's music was first put onto cd (1987 or so) all of their material from 1971 to 1976 was 'futurized' with reverb added and drums remixed to match the sound/success by Eliminator and Afterburner.  The thought was that they would need to tweak them slightly to get people to buy them who had already bought their albums on vinyl.  This is not usually done.  But it was with ZZ Top and Frank Zappa's catalog.  And in the case of Zappa, most original vinyl mixes have been re-salvaged nicely.<br /><br />So, pretty much everything here is not what ZZ Top actually meant to put on record.  After listening to it for years and years (radio) many people might think so.  The only albums that have been remastered and sound like their original selves is Tres Hombres and Fandango!  Also, there is Rancho Texicano: The Very Best of ZZ Top (2 disc) and Chrome, Smoke & BBQ [Box Set].  Every track found on Rancho Texicano is also on the box set.  But that Chrome box set is top notch and sounds fantastic!  So does Rancho Texicano!<br /><br />And that's it.  Greatest Hits, One Foot In The Blues, ZZ Top Six Pack and all the main albums from 1970 to 1976 (minus the 2006 remasters (Tres Hombres and Fandango!) are not worth it to me.  You get 75 - 80% of all those albums on the box set anyway.  Eventually, these albums will be re-issued and they will lose their futurized imperfections.  That will be a great day!  Long live the Top!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The Dark Knight is an amazing movie. Nolan seamlessly blends magic, dinosaurs, and occult horror into a film that satisfies on all levels.<br /><br />In an alternate future, a tyrannosaurus is sent back into the past by the British government to find the secrets behind brutal killings made sometime around the end of the 17th century. What he finds is beyond all imagination -- dark wizards have resurrected Sog Yunsmorath, a great evil from an unholy realm. Using his high-tech gadgetry and impressive marksmanship, the t-rex has to vanquish the foe for the good of the universe.<br /><br />Impressive on all marks, The Dark Knight is hands-down the movie of the year, and everybody owes it to themselves to watch this film.

B000RK1EQ2|5.0|My cousin Michael Trent Reznor is one amazing guy. His mind is so beautifully brilliant; he saves my day every time i wake up and hop out of bed! It's almost kinda like he's been living inside my head... Gets me all scared and I feel like it's time to run away; but would prefer to stay here & listen to what they have to say... do not really care for the oh so tiresome games of expose'. Perhaps, maybe this one would be better left for dead! But who's to say, what I've gotta say; when everything has already been read... We both know the path and the choices we had made... But please, do not, my child, ever think, that you are too young or old to play this 'charade.' My absolute favorite artist by far, there is no cessation when of this I so preciously & cautiously speak. I can only really hope, that this 'effigy' of 'eternity' is not merely for the weak. -AZR

386521584X|3.0|Robert Frank is an iconic photographer of American life.  For people in their 50's or older it is nostalgic. And for those younger, it is a visual slice of our history. There are many stories here. A good book.
B001DWXUWY|5.0|I have been listening to this album just about every day since my pre-order came in the Mail.  In all honesty, this is the best of 2008.  For a band that seems to just be getting started, with 2 excellent prior albums, to release a disk of this magnitude is OUTSTANDING.  I honestly think that GA could be the band that saves rock music.  Throw away your neon colors, your way too tight jeans, and cut your hair out of your face.  This is real music that is going to be around for a very long time.  I have been a fan of theirs for 2 years now and to see them live is an experience.  After just having toured with Thrice, Alkaline Trio and Rise Against, and hearing that Rise Against personally selected Gaslight to be on that tour, that should tell you non-believers something.  This is what music is, makes you want to move your feet, bob your head, even swing your hips.
B001DTPZNY|4.0|Its always so difficult to get a realistic review here on Amazon. People either love it or hate it, not much middle ground. When it comes to movies, most reviews are done by one of the following; people who love everything they see and are so enamored with pop culture they have no true opinion of their own anymore and just like something because its trendy. And the anarchist, the person who picks apart every flaw because it does not meet their standard of perfection.  Well folks, why do we watch movies??? To be entertained. Its not reality, its fantasy. So if you like to pick things apart you probably will not like this movie. And if you have low or no standards you will love it like everyone else told you to.  So heres my take. It had a typical Indiana Jones feel to it. Fun to watch for the most part. Enjoyed the fight scenes and chases. Harrison still has this character in his heart. Karen Allen had potential for an interesting part, starts well but then her character fizzles and shes just along for the ride. I could accept the concept of Indiana with a son and they have a moderate chemistry on screen.  The story line was a fairly quick pace. I just had a problem with the whole alien theme. To me it just seemed like it did not belong in an Indiana Jones movie. There are so many other genuinely interesting archaeological and historical places and stories they could have set Indy in. But aliens???  In the previous movies there was always the quiet little jokes that endeared Indy to us all, and this one is no exception. And his uncanny luck in getting out of tight spots. This time they streched that luck just a little too far.  I will give the hero of a movie the benefit of the doubt, and say for entertainments sake he is unusually lucky, when a bunch of bad guys are shooting at him and they all miss. Or he survies an explosion or accident.  But in this movie...they really pushed it, and Indy survives situations that no human being ever could. Yes, I remember I saidthat it was just for entertainment, but come on there has to be some degree of plausibility or the character no longer seems human and you might as well just give them superpowers if your going to do that.  Good actors, poor storyline and script.  But the question is...was I entertained? Yes. Would I spend money on this DVD because I would like to watch it again? Yes...  When it comes down to it, its all matter of personal taste. I almost always like movies that the critics hate, and hate movies that the critics love. It would have been an excellent movie if they had just taken it a little more seriously.  I gave it 4 stars, 3.5 would have been more appropriate.
B001ED7C58|5.0|Initially, I was uncertain about the soundtrack.  However, after listening to it and seeing the movie... I love it.  Great songs!
B00000IQW5|4.0|Are you a fan of aerial fire bombing? If not, this will make you one. Lots of round engines, sounds of Pratt and Whitneys, smoke and of course, fire. There is a love story too, isn't there always? Enjoy.
B001GKJ2DE|4.0|I have to say I love this movie since I watched it in theater.  I pre-order it when I saw the limited edition appear, I though it have extra stuffs to watch compare to the normal one.  Today I find out the second disc is just the digital copy(do the normal version have it too?), the extra stuff it have is a nice box, some postcards, a booklet and a (film cell?), those are not that useful or fun to play with. Right now what I have is a huge box to put in my DVD-case.   I am not sure it is worth it to spend extra almost 20[...] to have it.    But that's ok, I like this movie a lot.   Go back to watch it!
B001F7MSFW|1.0|Well, my husband wanted to rent it, but I told him I never saw the first one, he said, no problem, you don't need to, well, this has got to be one of the dumbest movies ever made, it rates right up there with that Arnold S. movie about being the last super hero, which I turned off after 15 minutes, I sat through this one groaning all the while. Needless to say I have no interest in seeing the first \\"Hellboy\\"... Selma Blair's character in \\"Hellboy\\" certainly mimics her role in \\"Kath & Kim\\", dreadful!
B0009DBXXG|5.0|Anyone who fell in love with the Movie Westside Story in the early sixties must view this fabulous dvd of Leonard Bernstein conducting his most popular composition.  He wanted his masterpiece to be performed by singers with the range expected of great operatic performers. Listen and see Kiri Te Kanawa and Jose Carreras as they strut their stuff under the stern but discerning eye of the master.  The interaction between Bernstein and Karreras is an eye-opener.  This is top quality entertainment.
0743496736|5.0|NINETEEN MINUTES was my first Jodi Picoult book. I had heard of it, like so many other books I ended up reading and loving, from Amazon, while browsing through its recommendations for me. I bought it not a week after first reading the reader reviews - and finished it not three days after that.     A school shooting is never something to be taken lightly - lives lost, other lives ruined, countless victims--whether they were actually there or had a bond with the victims is insubstantial. But if you're not actually THERE - can you really understand? This book, in its brilliance, made me feel like I was right there, experiencing the pain along with an entire town that had its life turned upside down. I could hardly believe what I was reading was a work of fiction.    On March 6, 2007, Sterling, New Hampshire is confronted with the worst kind of nightmare--ten children dead, in the town's own backyard, or rather, its local high school. Anyone hearing of it from afar - anyone not personally connected to Sterling or its inhabitants - probably say \\"That's awful\\" and go on with their days, but Lacy Houghton, Alex Courmier and her daughter Josie can't. Josie lost her boyfriend, Alex lost her daughter to the trauma, and Lacy lost her son - the 17-year-old who woke up one day and shot a group of teenagers to death.     While a mount of evidence and countless witnesses make the whole story an open and shut case, things are not always that simple. Because Picoult, through portraying years and years of torment through Peter's eyes, makes it clear that Peter had his reasons. As he himself says, \\"They started it\\". The true brilliance of NINETEEN MINUTES is making us have true mercy for a cold-blooded killer. It makes us doubt the very lives we lead, the very system we live by, and the very relationships we have with the people we love. How well can we know them, if we'd been hiding from what was staring us in the face all along?     This book will easily set your imagination aflameas you travel back in time to finally begin to understand what made Peter Houghton become a full-fledged monster. Several exciting and unexpected plot twists will make you gasp as you turn the page. And most of all, emotion and empathy will flow through you as you study every facet of those most impacted by the shooting. NINETEEN MINUTES questions it all - seperates what we WANT to be from what we NEED to be; the way a mother looks at her child and what she sees; the decisions we make with death, pain and fear storming at us from every direction. It makes us doubt the very nature of our lives.
045122499X|5.0|Ken Follet is one of the best writers.  I have read Pillars of the Earth and now World Without End.  These two books are absolutely fantastic.  I could not put them down.
0312944098|5.0|I have been a fan of Jeffrey Archer since Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less and I too agree that he is one of the best story tellers today.<br /><br />The back cover states, \\"the author spent five years in the House of Commons, sixteen years in the House of Lords and two years in Her Majesty's prisons....\\" This book was written after that time spent in prison in which he kept extensive diaries.<br /><br />Prisoner of Birth is a fascinating story about two mates/friends that were celebrating at a pub and one of them ended up dead and the other ended up in prison. He weaves together the life in prison, the lives of police, the lives of lawyers, the lives of judges, the life of parole boards and the lives of everyday normal people.<br /><br />You will find this book hard to put down and you will wonder what kind of movie it will turn out to be.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie! I would say I dont like nor dislike musicals in general, but the story, songs, and actors really make this a gem. You can watch the whole version on many online sites. I will get the dvd because I liked it that much!
0321344758|5.0|This book was on the \\"suggested\\" reading lists for an interface design class that I took in college. I checked out the first edition from the library and read it from cover to cover in one night. I decided that it had to be a permanent part of my collection because it is just so well-written and concise in its message. The title doesn't lie- it definitely is a \\"common sense\\" approach, but after surfing the internet for so many years, banging my head against the wall, and pulling my hair out, it's obvious that \\"common sense\\" isn't so common on the web.    Just a fair warning: if you're looking for something to open your eyes and tell you about things you've never noticed, you might be disappointed in this book. While I read it, my reaction to most chapters was \\"YES! This HAS bothered me! I need to keep it in mind so I never make this mistake myself.\\"    I would suggest this book to anyone who fancies themselves a web designer.
0881030686|2.0|Strunk and White, Elements of Style has an excellent reputation as a classic in the field of basic grammar and composition.  However, I found that the tone and composition of the book lends itself to an audience of insiders,' those who are already well-versed in the basic principles.  It is not of much use in teaching those who are confused or need more clarity on the subject.  Furthermore, the tone of the book is rather haughty and elitist, which was a turn-off for me.  As someone with a strong English background, I can use the book and learn from it.  But I would not recommend it to a student of the language.
B000003S5H|5.0|The other day I got in my car for a long trip, and I randomly found Moon Safari on my iPod and gave it a whirl.  I hadn't heard it in a while, but as it ran through I realized that even though this album is TEN (wow!) years old, it still sounds fresh and perhaps is one of the best CDs I've ever heard (and the final track is perhaps one of the best album closers of all time).  I am eternally grateful to my friend Blake who introduced me to Air all those years ago.  If I were stranded on a desert island with only an iPod and a few tracks to listen to, this would most definitely be on my list.
0545128285|2.0|This is one of those books you have to read and own just because you are a rabid Harry Potter fan.  This is certainly not a book smaller children should read, and certainly not stories even the wizarding community would want to read to their children.  Far too dark and graphic.  Stories are interesting, but not on par with the harry Potter series.  Overall, it is fun to own just because you are a Harry Potter fan, but if anyone other than JKR wrote this, it would not sell.  The commentary from Albus Dumbledore was rather boring and predictable.  Hopefully JKR will put a little more effort into her next publication.
0142412023|5.0|This book was wonderfully witty, and I very much enjoyed reading it. John  Green is a great author with much potential.
0575081406|3.0|Rothfus has demonstrated a tremendously skilled pen.  As an aspiring author who hopes to publish in the not-to-distant future, I can learn a lot about crafting a solid world with a gifted pen.  So why would I give it 3 stars? (3.5 is what I would do if it allowed)    First: I felt that the book is an original means of telling a fairly standard fantasy fare story.  The magic system felt too familiar.  For a book to get a 5 from me, it needs to wow me with a world that feels fresh and original (Sanderson's Mistborn for example.)  Name of the wind presents the story in an original way putting a slight twist on first person narratives.  So it felt like an original way to tell a standard story.    Second: I won't say anything to spoil endings, but just say that the way the book ended left me unsatisfied.  It just didn't feel like a real book ending.  I finished the 700 pages feeling unsatisfied, but not feeling like I just had to get the next book either.  It felt too much like what happens when a movie has to be divided across multiple dvds.  Name of the wind doesn't end well enough to stand as a satisfying experience on its own, but it didn't end in a way that made me feel like I had to keep going either.      The quality of the writing, and the delivery of the story is exceptional.  I wouldn't even argue with other people who rate it higher. I however felt an exceptional pen didn't do enough to satisfy me and leave me with baited breath for the sequel.  If I were to rate Rothfus as a skilled wordsmith and worldsmith it would be 5 stars.  I just don't feel that the final product with all factors considered is higher than 3.5 stars.
0765348276|5.0|Tired of the endless stream of fantasy novels? Wizards, Elves and sorcerers are not for you? You just found the solution. Scalzi pictures a technical future where people really fight, for the survival of mankind no less. And where evil people are just that. Ok, we're not there yet, it takes a stretch of imagination, but then, the F in SF means fiction. For me this book is an absolute must-have as a light, enjoyable page-turner. There is only one downside: you may lose sleep if you buy it.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|First, the films great. Watch it with subtitles. I like watching it again and again because theres so much going on under the surface (you've got the 2 corrupt cops (Ramirez & Weiz) the Joker murdering citizens cos Batman will not reveal his true identity (which forces the lawyer to disclose his identity) and so forth. The movie really holds up. Though I prefer Batman Begins, this has a lot to offer. Both are absolutely superb films<br /><br />The extras are interesting. You've got Sal as one of the mob bosses being interviewed on Anthony Michael Hall's talk show, along with Harvey Dent, and his people. You even get a hint as to what caused the Jokers creation<br /><br />You can get to see the Imax sequences on their own; theres a little film on the 2 notes that vie with one another that they used for the Jokers musical theme<br /><br />The 6 newscasts from Gotham City Network are an hour long - along with the bonus features, those are all on disc 2. The film fits on the first disc. You can watch it with subtitles in English, French, Spanish.<br /><br />The 2dvd comes with a digital copy - apparently you can download that from the features disc, though I've not done that.<br /><br />Engrossing film. Probably the best film that came out this year, and fully deserving of the hype. This being Heath Ledgers last completed film, this should probably earn him a posthumous nomination as best supporting actor<br /><br />Excellent cast all around, considering. Michael Caine is superb, so's Aaron Eckhart (as the illfated White Knight of Gotham). Great supporting cast, great scenes all around. Me, I love the scene in the holding cell, with the Joker being pounded to hell<br /><br />As the Joker tells the Batman: \\"You didn't disappoint\\"<br /><br />That being said, I still prefer the first film.<br /><br />But they're both great. Pre production on Batman 3 starts next month, although how they're to follow up the Dark Knight..<br /><br />BTW the Dark Knight is being reissued to IMAX theatres next month as well. Well worth seeing as 20 minutes of the film were shot in IMAX format<br /><br />Be seeing youere shot in IMAX format    Be seeing you
B001GKJ2DO|4.0|This isn't designed to be high art.  It's designed to put a smile on your face and, if you're middle-aged, a little nostalgia in your heart.  I grinned like an idiot throughout the movie the first time I saw it.  You can't help it.  The music makes you happy, and the actors are obviously having a good time.  Production values?  Who cares!  That's not what this movie is about.  It's about a rolicking good time and a romantic fantasy come true.  On those levels, it more than delivers.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Somewhat of a guilty pleasure, \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\" is one of my top 5 movies. Those that like Monty Python will like this movie, but I have shown it some folks who do not \\"get it\\" or are offended by the religious and sexual content.<br /><br />That being said, this movie contains some of the funniest scenes ever put into a film and is very quotable. My wife and I find ourselves saying, \\"It's not the real grail?\\", \\"I shall taunt you a second time\\", \\"One, two, five...\\", and oh so many others as the occasion fits. We have not allowed our children to watch it, so the quoting is fairly annoying to them, but sooner or later they will watch it and \\"get it\\", just not with me.<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B000GUJYRE|1.0|I agree with the weak review, and am sorry I purchased this set.  Flat, unemotional; expression is non existant compared with the Muti, and Solti sets with Philadelphia and Chicago.  It would be hard to get hooked on Beethoven with these recordings.  I note that the musicians sound in the loud/fortissimo sections as if they are mad...and play with a pounding, hammering, hap hazard execution.  Very disappointing.
B001GKJ2E8|1.0|Warning! Before you buy this with your hard earned cash be aware that this is another crap DVD that forces you to watch the trailers and ads EVERY TIME you put this DVD in your player. You cannot skip past them. Menu button does not even work. Outrageous.
1400034779|2.0|If you like strictly episodic books with no character development, no dramatic arc, and occasionally trite prose, this is the book for you. What's more, the solution to each of the little \\"mysteries\\" (and I use the term loosely) was, by and large, predictable, including the sappy ending. I don't generally read mystery books, and maybe that's the problem -- but so many people recommended this thing that I tried to ignore the hype and dove in. What a waste of time when there are so many really good books out there to read...
0575081406|5.0|The Name of the Wind is an amazing story written by Patrick Rothfuss -- and is a valuable addition to any library.  I can say very little that has not been said in the other reviews of this book -- but the one thing I can reiterate is that this is a must have.  I ended up reading the last third of the book in one sitting because every time I reached the end of a chapter I had to go to the next to see what was going to happen next.    Rothfuss' next book is due out in less then a year, and I for one am looking forward to the next step in this saga.  If you haven't yet, get this, read it and wait with the horde of Rothfuss fans for the next book.  It will be worth it, trust me.
B000053VAF|3.0|'Dogma' is an irreverent look at religion from auteur Kevin Smith. Though it was protested by religious groups it shows that Kevin Smith has obviously studied and thought about the subject quite a bit, though his view is admittedly askew. I was expecting that it would be a terrible movie, but Smith had a lot of profound thoughts and waited until he was mature enough as a film maker to tackle them. There was only a few places where the acting was as bad as in his first film, 'Clerks,' and by that I mean places where you are acutely aware that the actors are reading a script, one weighted down with a lot of philosophy and theology, and they falter under their burden. Ben Affleck, as rogue angel Bartleby, carries a lot of the excess theological baggage, so I suppose that it isn't really fair to single him out. Salma Hayek, as the muse Serendipity, was nominated for a Razzie award for worst acting--but she didn't win it!<br /><br />In 'Dogma' we have the usual Kevin Smith obsessions: New Jersey, Quick Marts, Hockey, John Hughes film references--and there is the usual cast of Jason Mewes and himself as Jay and Silent Bob, along with frequent flyers Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Jason Lee, augmented with Chris Rock as the 13th Apostle Rufus, Linda Fiorentino as Bethany Sloane, Alanis Morissette, Bud Cort, Salma Hayek, Janeane Garofalo, and Alan Rickman.<br /><br />If you have ever wondered how many angels could dance on the head of a pin, and wanted to see a movie that ponders such topics--along with pot, potty, and other sorts of tasteless jokes--then 'Dogma' is the movie for you! Not nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be.<br /><br />-----<br />Nun: You don't believe in God because of Alice in Wonderland?<br />Loki: No, \\"Through the Looking Glass\\". That poem, \\"The Walrus and the Carpenter\\" that's an indictment of organized religion. The walrus, with his girth and his good nature, he obviously represents either Buddha, or... or with his tusk, the Hindu elephant god, Lord Ganesha. That takes care of your Eastern religions. Now the carpenter, which is an obvious reference to Jesus Christ, who was raised a carpenter's son, he represents the Western religions. Now in the poem, what do they do... what do they do? They... They dupe all these oysters into following them and then proceed to shuck and devour the helpless creatures en masse. I don't know what that says to you, but to me it says that following these faiths based on mythological figures ensure the destruction of one's inner-being. Organized religion destroys who we are by inhibiting our actions... by inhibiting our decisions, out of... out of fear of some... some intangible parent figure who... who shakes a finger at us from thousands of years ago and says...<br />==================<br /><br />OTHER NOTABLE FILM ROLES FROM 'DOGMA' CAST MEMBERS<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00067BBLY De-Lovely]] (2004) ....

B00009YNGA|5.0|I forgot aboout this cd. I have it. but, I completly forgot she made this one. It's been along time, since she made an album, Blackout and the new Circus, is just still new yet.    This is a good CD, i wish to see her as herself though, they are keeping her like a kid pop star again. I think so.
0316017922|3.0|This book does not live up to the standard set in Blink and Tipping Point.  While I enjoy reading Gladwell, I was disappointed with Outliers.  It is a short book with a few good stories and some little \\"truth gems\\" sprinkled throughout, but other authors have done better work on the same subject.  In particular, I would recommend Colvin's \\"Talent is Overated\\" for a more in depth treatment of \\"Outliers\\" or people who have become successful.  Gladwell focuses more on the element of luck and opportunity, see the chapter on his own family in particular, while skimming over the other factors like hard work, deliberate practice, coaching and mentoring that play at least an equal role in anyone's success.  It is an interesting read, but probably better to break it up and publish the separate chapters in the New Yorker.
0307387178|4.0|Jon Krakauer did a great job of describing the adventure and misfortune of Christopher McCandless.  If you like this book, read \\"Into Thin Air\\" by Krakauer as well.  Another good book.
B00007GZR5|4.0|The first reviewer has more than adequately written about the story of the film, and much better than I ever could.<br /><br />First, let me say that I've always had a fndness for Robin Williams' films. OK, he's sometimes schmaltzy, but for a long time he was only given schmaltzy and/or cartoonish roles. What did anyone expect? People who are still biased against him might want to check out his later work.<br /><br />Anyway. I recently tuned into this film out of idle curiosity, and found myself completely mesmerized by the highly saturated colors and pretty realistic visual effects used in the film. I have to say that color and visual texture are some of my favorite things in movies; watching a richly-shaded film like \\"Girl With a Pearl Earring\\" is, for me, to experience two hours of pure visceral delight.<br /><br />I really didn't care too much about what the film had to say about the living and the dead. But I tend not to get my philosophies from movies.<br /><br />A film critic once called the film \\"Barry Lyndon\\" \\"a feast for the eyes, a famine for the mind.\\" And some may say the same of \\"What Dreams May Come,\\" which at least is not hobbled by the wretched excesses of Stanley Kubrick's self-indulgent direction. But all the same, beauty should be celebrated. Too little of it comes out of Hollywood these days.<br /><br />This film does what the final sequence in 2001: A Space Odyssey failed to do: inspire simple awe in the beauty that is possible.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|The education combined with the effects and editing are a job very well done! Worth every penny.
B000BKVQTS|5.0|This is a great movie for the whole family. Product delivery was fast and efficient.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|This is an excellent capstone to the Indiana Jones films.<br /><br />We have to note that this is first and foremost a reunion film that brings together the cast of the original film albeit in the 50s.<br /><br />It also brings together Lucas and Spielberg one more time and you can tell from the American Graffiti style scenes and the entire Sunday Matinee feel to the film in the typical Lucas/Spielberg serial style is there.<br /><br />Yes, this movie has an alien twist to it and some people felt that wasn't true to Indie.  However, if we look at all Indiana Jones films we see a \\"trueness\\" to the era.  During Raiders of the Lost Ark and the Last Crusade, we get the Nazi era and Hitler's obsession with the occult and ancient relics - he did have people scouring the earth for relics of that type.  In Temple of Doom we get a \\"trueness\\" to the religions of those parts of the world.  This last installment is set in the 1950s and in the 1950s people were worried about the Russians, Nuclear Weapons, and Aliens.  All of those elements are brought together and present in this last installment...so overall this last Indie is very true to the era.<br />You also get a flavor for Greasers and their bikes and college preps and their cars in a college setting town.  If you get into the mood of the setting, the movie is very true to its time and quite a bit of fun.<br /><br />Aside from that all, and I mean all of the same scenes from previous Indiana Jones and Star Wars series films are present in this installment - the car chases, the spelunking.<br /><br />Indiana Jones meets Shia Lebeouf -- who plays a young Indi Jones and son of Marion, Indi's love interest from Raiders of the lost ark.  Shia comes across as a bit whiney (I think that's how Lucas makes them be...think Mark Hamill in Star Wars or Hayden Christensen in Episodes II and III....its scary how Lucas brings back these same characters with different actors).  Overall it plays well.<br /><br />Kate Blanchette plays a great Villanese and Indi is in great form.<br /><br />This is great fun of a very high order.s great fun of a very high order.
B0002S94BG|1.0|KEEP your original copy of \\"Grace\\" or buy a used one while you still can.  First, the \\"Grace\\" album itself warrants five stars.  It is stunning from start to finish.  The problem is with this \\"remaster\\".  Like most of the dung the industry and record companies continue to heap on us, this remaster is s**t.  It is UNNECESSARILY over-compressed, overmodulated, and DISTORTED.  The only passages you need to hear to prove this are the loud peaks in \\"Hallelujah\\" - i.e. \\"I've seen your flag...\\" or \\"And every breath we drew...\\".  The digital distortion in Jeff's voice is a direct result of George Marino's LOUSY mastering.  It makes me want to vomit.  Marino either has NO ears or didn't have the stones to stand up to Columbia and tell them he would not desecrate this beautiful record by mastering overly hot according to current industry \\"standards\\".  These passages are NOT distorted on the original CD of \\"Grace\\".  Howie Weinberg's mastering on the original issue sounds wonderful, especially by comparison to this monstrosity, and keeps in perfect balance the dynamic highs and lows and \\"breath\\" in the music and without distorting the peaks.  This remaster is not the way this album should be heard and experienced.  Everyone who allowed this to happen should be ashamed.
B001E7OO2I|5.0|At first, I wasn't too sure that this CD was good (you know how you just skip through songs when you first play it) but after letting the CD play continuous in my truck and iPod, I love it! JL has once again put a great CD together with some great songs. I hope I can make it to his concert!
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|I don't remember who or what turned me on to Incubus. I also don't have any idea how I managed to miss this when it was released year before last. What I do know for sure is that their two CDs [[ASIN:B00005JCRW Make Yourself]] and [[ASIN:B00005QG9J Morning View]] (from 1999 and 2001 respectively) are two of the most treasured and regularly played in my collection.<br /><br />I came across \\"Light Grenades\\" in a recent edition of \\"Attitude\\" magazine. It was 'The Sex Issue' and in a feature called 'Lust In Music', a delightful-looking young man called Eyo told us that this album was his favourite to \\"get jiggy to\\". I was intrigued, obviously, and immediately placed an order.<br /><br />Eyo describes the album: \\"It's nu-metal but softer,\\" he says. \\"I like the album because the lyrics are about love and relationships. It puts you in a headbanging/mosh pit frame of mind which is great to have sex to.\\"<br /><br />Well, I'm celibate so I don't know about any of that but what I do agree with is that the music on this disc - heart rending one minute, head-banging the next, is exquisite. And that's before we even get to the singing and the lyrics. As always, lead singer Brandon Boyd's voice seems to reach into your chest and grab you by the throat at the same time and it just refuses to let go. It's brilliant.<br /><br />Produced and mixed by Brendan O'Brien, this is one of my best buys of the year and I just can't seem to stop playing it. No favourite tunes here; as far as this listener is concerned, every single song is a winner. A highly recommended disc. (And many thanks to my man Eyo).<br /><br />Incubus is: Brandon Boyd (vocals, percussion); Michael Einzinger (guitar, piano, Rhodes, string arrangements); Jose Pasillas (drums); Chris Kilmore (turntables, Hammond B3, Moog Voyager, Rhodes, Mellotron, piano, Marxophone, Theramin) and Ben Kenney (bass, vocals).
B000W91RUG|5.0|This is the best series created in years.  It's smart, clever, and especially hilarious if you understand 'big words'.  Finally, something for those of us who actually enjoy using our brains.  My life is my reality, I want to laugh after work.  Can't wait to buy the second season.
6304711921|5.0|I would like to give you a review of this movie, but I have yet received it.  It has been well over a month since I ordered it.  I have sent Emails asking for help, haven't gotten any. But the good news is somebody got $30.00 of my money, I feel like I have been robbed.  I can't believe my $30.00 is making the Amazon.com Company hugh profits, plus making payroll for thier employees.  I know the movie is realy coming from Movies for less (HA, Ha, Ha).  But it was ordered through you guys and I will never do bussiness with you again and never will my friends and family.  I have to go now and catch a plane to D. C.

B000EK76K8|4.0|I just got a 24\\" iMac 3.06 after my 9 year old custom PC died. It was time anyway and having been an early adapter of Apple computers, it was time to return to them. I will be using Fusion 2.0 to run Windows XP Pro on the iMac since all my business software is Windows.<br /><br />So having a very  nice 21\\" ViewSonic monitor, I knew from reading up on the iMac that I would be able to use it as a second screen just by plugging it into the back of the Mac. Of course, I did NOT expect a full size DVI-D plug on the back after looking at pictures of the back of the iMac online, so I knew I would need some sort of ADAPTER to be able to use the cord that came with the ViewSonic. This is that ADAPTER.<br /><br />I keep capitalizing ADAPTER because apparently some reviewers here are confused over just what this product is. It is an ADAPTER which goes from the cable your second monitor already has on it or came with it to the back mini jack on the back of your Mac. It is NOT a full size monitor cable. Doesn't say it is and doesn't pretend to be. I work in the world of film and video and we use hundreds of different ADAPTERS to hook things back and forth into equipment. It's part of the job since there are so many different pieces of equipment and they all seem to have their own plugs.<br /><br />So folks, read up on what you need. Apple does make other ADAPTERS to fit other cables. Just make sure you buy the right one and you'll be fine. But make sure you read up on it and see what you need. There are other ADAPTERS and cables offered here on Amazon that will work too and some that are longer. But you will need a monitor cable with the right sex and right pin configuration to use this ADAPTER with your iMac.<br /><br />As far as the ADAPTER is concerned. It works. It's a little pricey but hey, it's Apple. And as of this writing, they've dropped the price here so that even with shipping, it's cheaper than ordering it from Apple online or picking it up at a local Apple Store if you have one near.<br /><br />With mine, I plugged it into the ViewSonic DVI monitor cable, switched on the Viewsonic, turned on the iMac, and BAM, there they were. Adjusted the screens using the Mac's System Preferences and I'm now happily using double screens.<br /><br />So if you need it, buy it. It works!you have one near.<br /><br />With mine, I plugged it into the ViewSonic DVI monitor cable, switched on the Viewsonic, turned on the iMac, and BAM, there they were.

1400082773|5.0|I really liked this book.  It gives a great background on President-elect Obama and touches in a positive way on the way he grew up and what he took the time to learn about his heritage.  It answers many questions about his heritage, history, and his formative years.
0670033375|4.0|Overall, I have nothing but praise for this book.  I do not want to explain my reasons for this as other reviewers have done an an excellent job. Rather, I just want to point out that the last figure in this book showing a one-to-one correlation between nations with environmental troubles and ones faced with political instability is completely absurd. For example, Sudan and Colombia are not even on the map showing the politically unstable countries, and China is not on the one showing countries with serious environmental challenges. I just feel that that figure is so grossly erroneous that it takes away from the books overall message.
0670019925|5.0|I loved the book. perhaps i am prejudiced because i am hearing impaired and wear 2 hearing aids, but i bought a copy for a friend(and wife) and both found it uproarious until it became terribly moving. my husband loved it as well and he hears perfectly. the one sentence i memorized and wrote down  was\\"if there have been at various times in our life, trivial misunderstandings, now i see how one was unable to value the passing time\\". these are words i try to live by every day.
B000YY6790|5.0|THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT ONE OF THE BEST PIECES OF MUSIC TO COME OUT OF THE LATE 60'S THAT YOU WILL HEAR. IF YOU CAN SPRING IT BUY THE SHM CD FROM JAPAN. THIS WAS AN ALBUM THAT NEEDED TO BE SMOOTHED OUT A BIT SOUNDWISE. THAT BEING SAID-THIS IS A HEADSET CD. YOU CAN'T GO WRONG.
B0015DWJX2|4.0|The story in this book is told through a series of letters between the protagonist, London author Juliet Ashton, and her friends, family, and--most importantly--residents of the island of Guernsey, who tell the story of their lives and living under German occupation during WWII.  In these days of e-mails and hurried correspondence, we have forgotten that fine letter-writing used to be an art.  The letters are for the most part clever, funny, and draw the reader into a tale of war and its aftermath that has a emotional quotient as well.  However, the book is really about the characters, not war.<br /><br />The first half of the book, where Juliet is corresponding with the Guernsey residents from London, is more interesting than the second half of the book, where Juliet has travelled to Guernsey to meet with her pen-pals and tells the story through correspondence to friends and associates back in London.  Although I found the ending to be a bit too sweet, I enjoyed the journey and would recommend this book.  It is especially good for night-table or commuter reading because the text is broken into short chunks (the letters).
1600244874|4.0|Holidays on Ice by David Sedaris is the perfect Audiobook for this time of year.  It's actually 12 short stories and most of them are about Christmas, but there are Halloween and Easter stories too.  The Audiobook consists of 4 CDs, so it's about 4 hours long and the stories range in length from about 10 minutes to about an hour.  This was ideal for me this time of year; I started listening to it while I was cooking Thanksgiving dinner and finished it in 3 or 4 more sittings.  Since it's short stories, there was no picking up where you left off.    These stories are humorous, and some of them are laugh out loud funny.  David Sedaris reads most of them and he has the perfect tone for the sarcasm and dry wit in the stories.  My favorites are \\"SantaLand Diaries\\" and \\"Jesus Shaves\\".  \\"SantaLand Diaries\\" is the true story of David's experiences working as an elf in Macy's SantaLand.  \\"Jesus Shaves\\" tells the story of the bells delivering candy to French children for Easter.  (I think this one struck a chord with me because we used to live in France.)  Both of these stories made me laugh out loud.  This Audiobook contains language that is not appropriate for children.
B0017I1FNK|2.0|I regard myself as Harris' biggest fan by a large margin.  This, however, is the weakest work she's ever done.  The songs just aren't up to her standards.
B000Q66PXE|5.0|I'm not gonna indulge in any critical analysis, just gonna let you know where my mind is.  Best tv series ever? 1.Deadwood 2. Rome 3.The Tudors    Can you guess what my major in college was?
159102594X|5.0|Here I am devouring countless fantasy titles during my impatient days waiting for A Dance with Dragons, and nothing seems to be sustaining my appetite.  This does the job. I hate these analogies but it's kind of like a cross between The Belgariad and The Song of Ice and Fire. I know those are lofty and beloved titles but I must say this comes through.  I can't think of a fantasy reader being dissapointed by these novels.  And the best part of all is that the books all poured out in a lightning pace.  He wrote them fast, and they were delivered to us fast.    The best part about this series, and the author himself, is that the characters are all so distinct. In other fantasy novels it seems that one characters name can be substituted for another during any piece of dialogue. They all sound the same.  These characters are all rich and vastly different.  This book also made me laugh out loud a few times.     My only critique of the book is that there is no world map, or any other map for that reason. The author has explained himself on this and it is an adequate explanation, nonetheless it is frustrating at times.     It feels good to have found another five star Fantasy Series, especially if you are like me and beyond frustrated waiting for A Dance with Dragons to come out.  This is a very good fantasy series, and opening book. It's very character rich, but there are definitely not an overwhelming number of characters. Perfect.  Say one thing about Joe Abercrombie. Say he's written a good fantasy series.
B000V801PK|5.0|I just love the entire CD. At first I did'nt but as I played it a few times, I have grown to really enjoy all the songs.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|This is definitely the album that Metallica should have released after And Justice For All. It's no Master of Puppets, and really nothing like Metallica's first two, but it beats all hell out of the Load albums, and also St. Anger.      If I could find one thing that I thought could have ruined this album, it was Hetfield's vocals. Come on, lets all be honest: his vocals on this sound exactly like they did on the Load albums. There's no real attitude that bursts forth like Puppets or on Justice.      But what saved this album from being classified along with the last three, was the killer riffs and solos of Kirk Hammett. Take him out of the mix and I think Metallica would really be done. His playing on this sounded like he wanted to be a lot heavier than what he was allowed to be on previous releases.      Lars sounds good, his drumming sounding more fresh and more in line with what he did on Justice.      Standout tracks that will make you bang your head like the old days are, All Nightmare Long, Cyanide, and My Apocalypse. The instrumental on here, Suicide & Redemption, is pretty good, sounding like part of a soundtrack to an action or horror movie.      Death Magnetic is a step back in the right direction, but it's no Master of Puppets II.

B0018AK9RA|1.0|Never in my life did I ever think I would have to reach over for the remote to turn down a Judas Priest album. I can't even comment on the songs because I couldn't find one that made me proud to be a Priest fan.      I've been a fan of Judas Priest for something like twenty years and I've never thought they would ever sound like this. If some fans think Turbo and Ram It Down were bad releases that had them wondering what happened to Priest's trademark metal sound, then Nostradamus will have them running back to Screaming For Vengeance and hiding in the corner.      Every member of Priest sounded bored on this, but this is the first release, whether on his solo stuff or other projects, where I thought the immaculate voice of Rob Halford sounded half of what it was capable of.      Being a fan who always thought of Priest as one of the founding fathers of Metal, I really hope this is a one time blunder and not a sign of things to come.

0545128285|1.0|I have read all the Harry Potter Series and some of it was DARK this is not one I would recommend for anyone under the age of 12.  I worry that JK Rowling has followed a bad niche of going into the evil. Harry was not evil. This is not like Cinderella where good over comes evil. It is gross and frightening. I try to review books before I give them to my grandchildren. I would NEVER give this to my grandchildren. NOT FOR CHILDREN. Send a message to Rowling to write more up lifting literature for children. There is enough gore on TV. If this is all you can write, QUIT writing for kids.
B000YAA68C|4.0|While watching this I was almost annoyed that I was crying so much, because it was my day off work (hence the loss of one star).  I don't necessarily want to spend my day off crying, but what a great movie.  Hillary Swank gave a great performance from beginning to end, and I'm not really a Hillary Swank fan.  I've nothing against her.  She just never made a big impression on me.<br /><br />Much of the movie takes place in Ireland.  They're back and forth from the U.S. to Ireland.<br /><br />This is a movie I've thought about buying.  I don't buy many movies, but I would spring for this one.
B001GQ2TGA|4.0|Every year around this time, I buy one or two Christmas CD's.  So far this year it's Enya's \\"And Winter Came.\\"  I agree with the reviewers who have expressed the opinion that this is more an Enya CD than a Christmas CD per se, even though the songs clearly have a Christmas element.  I happen to like Enya's sound and this is a high quality sample of that sound, which is what you'd expect from her.  Even if you're not a big Enya fan, this CD is worth giving a try for the Christmas element.
B001ED7C58|4.0|In my wildest dreams, never could I have predicted that one day I would be writing 2 CD reviews in a row that relate to vampires.  Yet, here is #2.  Vampires are everywhere nowadays.  In the media, that's what I mean (don't I???)  In any case, the idea of vampires has assumed some importance in my life lately, but I'm not sure why.  Well, back to the matter at hand.  I've read the book, and now I've heard the soundtrack.  It is, as Brit Rob Pattinson might say, \\"a bit of alright\\".<br /><br />Half the tracks have a techno-pop-rock sound, with varying themes mostly dark, mysterious and/or passionate.  One of these is probably my favorite track, Perry Farrell's \\"Go All the Way Into the Twilight\\", which includes a rap by a girl who repeats, leaving no room for doubt, \\"...so take me, take me, take me!!\\"  Paramore's \\"Decode\\" has the unforgettable line, \\"...the truth is hiding in your eyes, and it's hanging on your tongue, just pouring in my blood.\\"  The same band's \\"I Caught Myself\\" says it in a different way:  \\"You got it, you got it, some kind of magic/Hypnotic, hypnotic, you're leaving me breathless.\\"  Whew!  Linkin Park contributes a rock ballad concerning the singer's worries about how he will be remembered \\"...when my time comes.\\"  Lightening up a little, there's \\"Full Moon\\" by The Black Ghosts, melodious and eerie with ghostly sighs and echoes, appropriate to their name.  \\"Eyes on Fire\\" by Blue Foundation is an odd song, with a slow, drawn-out melody and confident lyrics.  \\"Flightless Bird, American Mouth\\" by Iron & Wine reminds me of an early 60's slow-dance, ending with some great piano.  Star Rob Pattinson gets his turn to sing, backed by an acoustic guitar.  In this song, \\"Never Think\\", which he co-wrote and arranged, the restraint and hesitancy in his voice reflects Edward's reluctance to plunge into a relationship with Bella, but he ends up declaring his love.  The soundtrack wraps it up with \\"Bella's Lullaby\\", an orchestral instrumental which alternates in tone between darkness and light, thus summing up the entire story.<br /><br />So, I recommend this CD, but be forewarned:  one taste, and you will be hooked until the end of time...een darkness and light, thus summing up the entire story.    So, I recommend this CD, but be forewarned:  one taste, and you will be hooked until the end of time...
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|It is difficult to imagine any other actor trying to do the Joker anytime in the near future. Ledger owns the screen when he appears. His death takes that character out of this series of films. His performance is our gain, the story's loss.
0545128285|4.0|For those going through withdrawals from Harry Potter, J. K. Rowling offers this book.  It's a collection of 5 fairytales from the wizarding world.  It's a short book, but it is fun.<br /><br />Beedle the Bard's tales are as familiar to young wizards and witches as the Brothers Grimm's stories are to us.  And I can see why.  They have the elements of the classic fairytales we all know.  There's the story of the man whose magic cauldron begins to torment him when he refuses to help others.  Three witches and a Muggle have to work together to reach a fountain that will give one of them good luck.  In the funniest story, a king bans wizards and witches while trying to get their power for himself.<br /><br />And there's the story we already know from the final Harry Potter book.  Frankly, there is nothing new about the story of the three brothers who face Death and receive \\"gifts\\" for cheating him.<br /><br />The final story is the darkest involving a character removing hearts and two deaths.  Of course, if you read the originals of some of the fairytales, you'll see how dark they can be as well.  Still, parents might want to read that one before their kids.<br /><br />Each story is accompanied by commentary by Dumbledore.  These provide an insight into wizard history and some comedy as well.<br /><br />The biggest problem with the book is its size.  It's barely over 100 pages.  The large print makes it seem even shorter.  And a reference to a tale not included is just cruel.<br /><br />On the whole, this is a fun book Harry Potter fans will enjoy having in their collection.
B0012GN0Z8|5.0|To be honest, I'm not a big Springsteen fan. But if the version of \\"Chimes of Freedom\\" on this disc doesn't send chills up and down your spine, check your pulse--you just might be dead.
B00151QYU8|4.0|I loved this movie.  I went to Catholic school, so I got all the jokes, and it is FUNNY!  My Jewish friends walked out after 10 minutes; they had no idea what they were talking about in the film and they got bored.  But if you are in-the-know about Catholic dogma, it's a hoot and well worth the time.  I'm no Catholic myself, but I think you'd be pretty insecure in your beliefs if this movie offends you (it's profane; it's Silent Bob! I'm talking about issues of faith here that are tossed around like so many fooze-balls.) Bob clearly appreciates Catholicism- it's a strangely loving movie.  The cast is first rate, and Alan Rickman is at his dyspeptic best.    If you like this, I'd also recommend[[ASIN:0061438596 Lamb Special Gift Ed: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal]].

0375703861|3.0|I started this book not thinking I would like it. Not sure why, but maybe because friends didn't seem thrilled. Maybe because reviews were mixed. But in the end I enjoyed it quite a bit. At points it had a rather Salman Rushdie feel, but there was less fantasy and more realism involved. I found the dilemmas characters faced to be quite pertinent in today's world of melting pots and mixed identities. This story follows numerous generations of three families through their formative experiences, focusing on the youngest generation. Through it all Zadie Smith examines how our personas are affected by the past we conceive, the future we envisage, and the present we inhabit. I enjoyed the use of vernacular speech, which I often heard out loud in my head (probably terribly cliched).<br /><br />A quote I liked: \\"Mad Mary was looking at him with recognition. Mad Mary had spotted a fellow traveler. She had spotted the madman in him (which is to say, the prophet)...\\"

015603283X|3.0|\\"Club Dumas\\" did not grab me immediately the way that \\"Queen of the South\\" did. Also, I was pretty surprised to discover that the movie \\"The Ninth Gate\\" is ripped from half this story. I did enjoy this book, however. I like Perez-Revertes obvious literary interest. It's nice when I read something and it gives me ideas of other books to read. In \\"Queen of the South\\" I felt like the author was trying to make the reader see their life through Teresa Mendoza's story. Here I felt that Perez-Reverte attempted to draw the reader into a world where fiction and reality merge, and you find yourself within the story. But the book was a bit slower, and the ending was a cop out. The author used a sort of Deus-ex-machina to tie up the Dumas storyline, in my opinion. I very much enjoyed the \\"Nine Doors\\" portion of the story.
B00197POXG|5.0|When this show originally aired I was in highschool and busy with homework and social events so I never had the pleasure to watch it. A friend of mine suggested this series to me and her and I watched the entire DVD collection from beginning to end over a 4 month span. What an incredible show this is. The characters are great and I love the family values presented in this drama. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes Native American and early Western American history as well as medical pioneering. As from a previous reviewer, the box is not as sturdy as expected but the discs are the main attraction anyway.
B001F0RA4S|3.0|I didn't realize until I actually picked it up and started reading that the author of \\"The Hours\\" was a man. Given the subject, I just assumed the author would be female.<br /><br />It was a strange book; it didn't completely hook me, but definitely engaged me. The story lines wound around each other in a delicate way, like separate vines up a wall. Touching, related, but not entirely one. The depth of Cunningham's exploration into Virginia Woolf was lovely. He found a place in himself to write from her; to know her from her. The other two stories were somewhat less poetic, but certainly interesting. However I felt Mrs Brown's storyline was somewhat unfinished. I would say modern Clarissa's story seemed the most concrete.<br /><br />I guess this book seems to me more like a painting or a feeling than a book. It left me with a taste of something, but it's like vapor. Not completely tangible.

0142000655|4.0|John Steinbeck's classic is a story about every family. It's a story about the first family. In a totally unoffensive nonreligious style his Cain and Able takeoff examines the cyclic nature of humanity. We frequently find ourselves eerily following in the footsteps of our parents. Or find ourselves with the ones most similar to those who have hurt us before. Ultimately, \\"East of Eden\\" gives an example of how to break the mold. Whatever holds us back, whatever our mistakes, Steinbeck shows how it is possible to break the cycle, how we can learn from the past, how the greatest endowment of humanity is choice.
B000ICM0YY|5.0|DG has gathered on this convenient 9 CD set, all the Beethoven Sonatas recorded for them by Emil Gilels in his later years. He died, in 1985, shortly before his 69th birthday, before he could complete the cycle. They were originally published as recorded, over more than a decade, between 1972 (Sonatas No.21 \\"Waldstein\\" and 28 op. 101 - Gilels was 55 then) and 1985 (three releases then: the two so-called \\"Electoral\\" Sonatas WoO 47/1 & 2, here on CD 1, paired with No.11 op 22; No.5 op. 10/1, No.10 op. 14/2 and 19 op. 49/1; and finally No. 30 op. 109 & 31 op. 110). Some of those originally released on LP were also previously reissued on CD, but in reshuffled couplings, sometimes even duplicating each other (as the 1972 Waldstein, the 1973 Appassionata and the 1974 \\"Les Adieux\\", [[ASIN:B000001G79 Beethoven: Sonataen - Waldstein, Les Adieux,  Appassionata]], or the same Appassionata with the Pathétique from 1980 and # 31 from 1985 (haven't found an entry on this website, it is listed under ASIN B0002UJJCS on the European sister companies, part of the Penguin Rosette collection), or again the pairing of 27 from 1974, 28 from 1972, 30 & 31, [[ASIN:B000024584 Beethoven: Klaviersonaten Nos. 27, 28, 30 & 31 [Germany]]]). Some others from the LP era were reissued only in the previous box set collating all of these recordings ([[ASIN:B0000012YO Beethoven: 29 Piano Sonatas / Gilels]] - not an entirely honest title, as there are 29 Sonatas there only by dint of including the two early sonatas without opus number) and never made it on individual CDs, at least on DG (the whole series was licensed by Olympia and released on individual CDs) : No. 6 op. 10/2, 12 op. 26, 16 op. 31/1, 25 op. 79.<br /><br />As the other reviewers have noted, the sound is uniformly good, and I don't hear any significant differences between the earlier and the later recordings - maybe slightly more vivid presence in these (and, over headphones, the occasional rumble of cars in the distance).<br /><br />The liner notes contain only an interesting general presentation of Gilels and Beethoven, but no analyses or presentations of the sonatas themselves. I'm particularly happy to have the two (out of three) early and obscure \\"Electoral\\" Sonatas from 1783 - nothing to do with democracy, they were dedicated to the Kurfürst or Archbishop-Elector of Cologne Maximilian Francis von Habsburg-Lothringen: they were in fact Beethoven's first piano Sonatas and I find their Haydn-esque wit and Sturm-und-Drang atmosphere irresistible. The essay contained in the liner notes is also very imprecise about which Sonatas Gilels didn't live long enough to record: they are No. 1 op. 2/1, 9 op. 14/1, 22 op. 54, 24 op. 74 \\"A Thérèse\\" and the ultimate one, 32 op. 111. An irretrievable loss: there are no other recordings, studio or live, of any of these Sonatas in Gilels' discography (the website of the label DOREMI hosts a magnificent Gilels discography compiled by Ates Tanin, to which I am entirely indebted for this review).<br /><br />For this reason only, this set obviously cannot be recommended as your only set of complete Beethoven Sonatas. As to the point of determining whether those we have are \\"the best\\" versions, it is a pretty senseless one, I think: ever since the advent of the recording process, there have been numerous complete recordings by the greatest giants of the piano in the 20th Century (starting with Schnabel, Backhaus and you name `em). And that's not mentioning those giants who have not recorded the complete cycle but only samples (Richter comes to mind, of course). Suffice to say that Gilels is one of these giants. No one seriously interested in the Beethoven Sonatas should fail to listen to him.<br /><br />Yet beware: as I write, the demanded price on the present website seems abnormally high. It sells for significantly less on the European sister companies, and I personally bought my own set on the famous Internet auction site for less than 20 $, postage included.
B001IUBZAU|5.0|AC/DC never lost the ability to rock. you can tell that they are dedicated to their music. it seems on this album that they like talking about Rock N Roll, as four of their songs are about Rock N Roll. they still retained their rock edge, which is rare for a band in their 50's. Angus will still be doing the duck walk in his 80's. I hope they release a new album next year.

I hate that Gotham seemed brighter and that the train from the first one wasn't even there, not even the rubble from its destruction.  It almost seemed like Batman's job was over.  So why was he still around?  Otherwise, this was a great movie and, I'm sure you've heard this before, but Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker was off the charts great.

I've never had any problems with any of his CDs. If you want a different take on some older songs, some original songs, and songs that can only be sung in Buble's style, buy his CDs.

B000Y179KO|3.0|Now that the dust has settled and the release of the long awaited EAGLES CD has passed by several months, it's time for a reality check.  Initially there were HUGE amounts of gushing about this project.  At first I too was so euphoric about anything new by the guys that I was more than willing to overlook the shades of disappointment about this collection.  Now having had sufficient time to be more detached from that rabid fan based exhilaration, I can readily admit that this should have been a SINGLE CD.  There are too many weak and boring filler songs that don't make the grade.      Take the best of the batch and you've got a worthy addition to the Eagles canon.
B00003OSU4|5.0|Ahh, you Boomers can take your  Woodstock and your Monterrey and most definitely your Altamont (*shudder*) - THIS is the music festival I'D loved to have been at: The Newport Jazz Festival of 1958. It's something of a sour old Gen-Xer's solace to think that it's unlikely the real event could have borne much resemblance to this utterly gorgeous film made by the great photographer Bert Stern, all cherry-red and sea-blue and glowing with an unreal light. Stern (most famous for the \\"last session\\" with Marilyn Monroe) makes everyone an icon, the audience as well as the performers.  These seem the very hip/squarest cats in the world at the right place at exactly the right time -- black guys in crisp suits and white guys in t-shirts and pompadours, girls in hats and scarves and boy's slacks, women in crinolines and multi-strand pearls and blue-tinted sunglasses, men in horn-rims and skinny ties --  all of them sitting together and bopping and smiling and smoking and occasionally getting up to jitterbug ecstatically in the angelic light of Bert Stern's awesome camera. You know it's a good show when Thelonious Monk is one of the opening acts, folks. Anita O'Day gets the party started, Chico Hamilton makes it mellow, Dinah Washington burns it up, Chuck Berry gets the kids rockin' and rollin', Louis Armstrong sends everyone into conniptions of rapture, and Mahalia Jackson absolutely steals the entire show at the end with The Lord's Prayer, a beautiful moment which truly seems to herald the breaking of a new kind of dawn.  A must-see.

B0001GMIOE|5.0|I still use the original canon BP511 battery which came in my Canon 300D which I purchased in 2003. I also have 2002 Canon BP511 batteries which came in Canon D60 . Amazingly, they are all still working well. To me, they are better than the others because they hold charges better and keep on working many years after  the others have died. The price is so much higher than the others, and I do buy some cheaper ones. But, when I do not carry any spare, and if I need to really depend on the batteries(I use two batteries in each camera), I always choose genuine Canon BP511 or BP511A.

B0019MLVEM|5.0|A mighty debut from a mighty Dublin trio.  Yes, folks, there's more to the Irish music scene than U2.  There, I said it.  I know there will be considerable comparisons made to the Celtic quartet, especially when the lead singer's high register may remind the listener of Bono and the melodies have a hint of Edge-esque sound to them.  It would be ridiculous for there not to be a certain modicum of influence and inspiration by one of the world's biggest bands and clearly Ireland's main musical export.  But The Script offer an instantly pleasing sonic experience with accessible tunes and lyrics.  The vocals are moving to the point that even this cynical reviewer finds a thaw of the heart and I have the infectious melodies linger sweetly in my head for hours after the mp3 player goes off.  now, if this band would only tour America so I could see them live, I would be perfectly sated!
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I like Kelly Clarkson a lot.  But I tend to keep that to myself because she is a massive pop star, and her songs are played ad nauseum on the radio.  I love her music, but no one can deny that she's overplayed.  That being said, My December surprised me.  Right from the get go, you know this is going to be different from Thankful and Breakaway.    Never Again - It's a harsh song that rips into an ex boyfriend.  It's not as radio friendly as Since U Been Gone, but it's catchy nonetheless (and it's great if you're going through a break up).   One Minute - I really liked this song, but I didn't love it.  It's not that catchy, but she sings it with conviction.  But I felt like this was an overproduced song...the machinery blaring in your ears with every note.  Hole - One of my favorites.  The guitars on this one are just amazing.  She veers into Amy Lee's territory with this one, but its still a great song.  Sober - Easily the most emotional song on the record.  It's a tender, hypnotic number at first.  Then you reach the bridge, and it all builds to a gorgeous crescendo.  Anyone who has survived a tough time in their life will hear in this an anthem for surivival and perseverance.  Don't Waste Your Time - I'm not a big fan of this one.  It's one of the \\"pop-ier\\" songs on the record, and it's kind of a curveball...you don't see it coming.  Judas - I only began to appreciate this one after events in my life mirrored the lyrics.  But I do find this track to be somewhat bland.  Haunted - Definitely more Evanescence than Kelly Clarkson.  I love this song.  It's haunting (ironically) and powerful.  Be Still - Unexpected is the only word I can come up with to describe this.  It's heartfelt and soft.  There is no powerhouse singing in this one.  She is mellow, and it suits her.  Maybe - Arguably the best song on the record.  It starts with just her and the guitar, and then builds to a rock finish.  There is no song on here that shows he voice better than this one.  How I Feel- Another pop song.  I really like this one though.  There's spunk in this one, and she shows herself for the fiery woman that she is.  It's infectious.  Yeah - The most random track I've EVER heard, but it works lol.  She sings with soul here, and the randomness of the trumpets in the chorus is so unexpected and welcome.    Can I have A Kiss - This is a strange song.  It's definitely a rock song, but it reminds me of Alanis Morisette during her heyday.  You'll like it, but it's not for top 40 radio.  Irvine - Haunting, haunting, song.  It sounds like a record, and that adds to the mysterious vibe it produces.  It's one of those songs that you actually listen to rather than sing along to it.  Chivas - The hidden track.  I love it.  Its just her and a guitar, and again it sounds like a record.  She's got soul and fire here.    Bottom line is that it's a great record, but its not for those who love top 40 music.  It's not made for radio.  It's one of those albums that you listen to and realize that the artist has produced something that THEY can be proud of, and that sales don't matter as much to them. This album showcases her versatility as an artist.  I respect her for that.
0553293397|4.0|\\"The Naked Sun\\" takes detective Elijah Baley to the outer settlements of the spacers to solve a mystery.    Once again, robot R. Daneel Olivaw joins the investigation.      The biggest difference between this and the normal life of Elijah Baley on Earth is that most of the investigation is under wide-open sky.  Baley is not comfortable, he would rather be back in his city's steel caves.  Meanwhile, we learn much more of the problems of the spacers.    But, Baley produces an interesting solution to the mystery.      I enjoyed reading this book.  However, it is a little bit too light a vehicle and does not get far enough into the spacer's problems or how Baley fits into that arena of the overall plot.    Try it.  It is entertaining.
1592289444|4.0|This adventure/survival story has parallels to PAPILLION (please see my review) as far as the limits of credibility goes. But that certainly does not invalidate it as far as what it is - a story and not a factual report. All the likely embellishments notwithstanding, it is a fascinating tale of human endurance and fortitude.<br /><br />All this debate about true/not true is fine on one level, the level of facticity. On a deeper level, it is the telling of a journey, an epic struggle to survive against almost impossible odds. What we are presented with is the veracity of improbable episodes vs. the telling of a reconstructed story that the author freely admits several times in the book of having memory lapses and a grasp of time & space that were altered by the extreme deprivations he suffered through.<br /><br />That this narrative was midwifed into existence by a British journalist who stood to gain by it by the author's sighting of a pair of Yetis certainly does shed a suspect light upon the enterprise. It is towards the end of this long walk when the author reports seeing a pair of strange ape-like creatures that did not shy away from him and his companions. So, by that chance happening, this book came into existence.<br /><br />As many of the previous reviewers have indicated, this is a book to enjoy as an adventure story. All the debate about whether it did or did not happen is really secondary to a pretty decent read.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1934289884 Parataxis]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1595941967 The Cloud Reckoner]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1425751881 Extracts: A Field Guide for Iconoclasts]]

0956010903|5.0|I have been enchanted with all things HP since I picked up the first book and then, quite against any personal fiscal responsibility, decided to order the BTB Collector's Edition. I was not disappointed and think that it will be a fabulous treasure to pass on to an equally enchanted grandchild (expecting my first in August!). The presentation is wonderful and although it's a replica, I think it accurately reflects the spirit of the 7 originals. I am curious if anyone else noticed what I (as an occasional copy editor)noticed on page 40; \\"....this tale survived the flames flames...\\"? Also, on page 46, last line; \\"...author of the infamous Toadstood Tales...\\" instead of Toadstool Tales? I am a bit surprised, but then they are notes by Albus Dumbledore so perhaps they were meant to be there? Curious.
0553381687|4.0|I will start this review off by saying I do not plan on reading any more of this series, not because it is lacking in any meaningful way, but because it is a vast departure from what has come to be expected from the genre.  After weaning myself from the barely-there trickle of relevance amid the broken-dam flood of irrelevance in Jordan's Wheel of Time series, this was recommended by a friend in its place.<br /><br />Where Wheel of Time reads more like what would happen if The Young and the Restless somehow procreated with a few episodes of Dragon Ball Z (the dragging plot tantamount to characters staring at one another and grunting for episodes on end while cookie-cutter protagonists do everything you expect them to and disappoint at the same time), A Game of Thrones promises a series with a gritty disregard for conventional aspects of the genre.  In the first half of the book we witness a seven year old thrown from a roof after witnessing two siblings having sex (rendered crippled, like, really crippled, not 'suddenly there was magic healing and everything was okay' crippled), a girl who's barely a teenager sold to and bred by some massive barbarian king (with almost pornographic detail used to describe it each time it happens), and a character who appears to be centric to the story permanently removed from the roster via deheadification.<br /><br />While none of this appeals to me as a reader, the merits of such an approach should not be overlooked by those who can potentially appreciate it.  This fantasy world introduces its more fantastic elements at sparse intervals, rendering it believable and gritty.  Protagonists and antagonists alike seem evenly matched (this does not suffer from 'farm boy sent on a quest to save the world from evil' syndrome), and my only gripe with the characters is that the ones I like are either constantly beaten down or killed altogether.  After a while, it grows depressing.<br /><br />The series shows promise in this excellent first installment, but be warned that the experience is not for those expecting something light, happy, and typical.  Pick this up if you're ready for brutal believability and realism, not if you want another cliche 'save the world' epic.ed that the experience is not for those expecting something light, happy, and typical.

B00002ZMNV|4.0|The key to a band's ultimate survival lies in its ability to do new things. Metallica is one of those bands that is willing to take chances: first with their music and secondly with how that music is presented to its fans. You may not always like the music but it's never boring.    In April 1999 the band played two shows at the Berkeley Community Theatre with Michael Kamen conducting the San Francisco Symphony. The nights were a mix of heavy metal styling joined to classical music. The strange and amazing thing was that the band actually pulled it off quite well.    The shows were performed on a stripped down stage with little background except a screen and some lighting effects. The music was a good representation of the band's music up to that point in its career. In 2.5 hours most of the band's catalogue was showcased. Standout performances included Master of Puppets,Fuel, No Leaf Clover, Sad But True and the ever popular Enter Sandman. The orchestra enhanced the performance by giving the songs a new sonic depth.    The dis has some issues: first the concert is spread over two DVDs. The show could have been conveniently placed on one disc. The sound mix (newly remastered in 5.1 Surround) has a sort of tinny feel at times that was not noticible in the Dolby 2.0 mix that was available on the source video tapes. The extra features include a 40 minute making of documentary and four songs presented with multiple camara angles.    This one is worth checking out.
0956010903|1.0|Although the description says this is a limited edition, it really isn't.  On sale for months, they still have copies available well into the Christmas season.  I guess the edition is limited to how many they can sell.    The book itself is fine; it looks nice on a shelf.  I haven't read the stories yet so I can't comment on those but that's not the reason I bought the book.  Considering how unlimited this edition truly is, it's not worth $100 unless you want to donate to Rowling's charity (in which case I would suggest a direct, tax deductible donation instead).  If you just want to read the stories, buy the regular edition instead as this edition will not likely appreciate in value anytime soon.
B000021Y77|4.0|I saw this one Friday night and soon after bought the dvd. The other reviews give you a plot breakdown, but I will mention a few things I really like. Filmed in Germany(West Berlin) maybe, and lots of outdoor city locations. I have only viewed the sub-titled version, and it works great. A couple dialogue- heavy scenes which require some reading, but not too taxing. I do have a thing for most things German, so I like hearing the language. Also a fine soundtrack in this film! Techno and pulsing, watch this on a home theatre or with a high quality audio system. It really adds to the experience imho. Plus I enjoyed the little \\"snapshot\\" stills that Twyker throws in along the way. Very cool.   Some negative reviewers say they didn't get the film and it was repetitive. Just go along for the ride and enjoy the sights and sound. In my opinion this is a real good way to spend an hour and a half. Try it out! Thanks for reading my sort of disjointed review.
0316017922|4.0|I just finished reading this book today.  I was apprehensive about buying this book because I was disappointed in Gladwell's last book \\"Blink\\".  The reviews for \\"Outliers\\" were mixed but I was interested enough to check it out.  \\"Outliers\\" consists of two parts.  Part One is called \\"Opportunity\\" and Part Two is called \\"Legacy\\".  I found Part One thoroughly interesting and was engaged the whole time.  I started losing interest when I started Part Two.  My take on \\"Outliers\\" is Gladwell is attempting to debunk the traditional notions of success by taking a closer look at why some people achieve extraordinary success while similar people flounder and never amount to anything.  I agree with Gladwell's notion that success has just as much to do with environment and opportunity as it does with intelligence, drive and talent.

1402210795|5.0|I am 45 years old and have read all of Heyer's books currently in print, several many times.  Friday's Child and Devils's Cub - two quite different stories - are Heyer's best.  Devil's Cub is traditionally romantic from beginning to end - tall, dark, impetuous hero and wise, grey-eyed heroine.  Friday's Child features a young, naive heroine and the clueless young man she adores but who does not value her until the end of the story. The cast of supporting characters is beautifully drawn, the dialogue is wonderful, the action is funny and fast-paced, and this is the only Heyer book that makes me cry every time I read it.  I am surprised by my tears every time.  Escapist fiction does not get any better.

B000V6I7WG|5.0|You know how effective a film is if after it's over and you're in bed trying to go to sleep, that the film in question refuses to leave your mind for a second and you cannot stop thinking about it.  \\"Oldboy\\" is such a film, and to deny the fact that it captures raw and brutal emotion within it would be a disservice.  Whether you love the movie or despise it, you cannot argue with the fact that it will at some point hit a nerve.<br /><br />\\"Oldboy\\" tells the tale of Oh Dae-su, who at first sight is just a drunken babbling mess who gives no one any ounce of respect, not even the cops who have arrested him for his drunken and disorderly conduct.  He sings, calls them hideous swear words and sees no wrongdoing on his part.  After he leaves the station, he is abducted by unknown captors.  He is imprisoned in a strange and isolated room... for 15 years.  For those 15 years, he nearly loses his mind and wonders what misdeeds of his past has brought him to this horror.  After 15 years, he is released without any explanation or answers.  Oh Dae-su vows that he will find the truth and get revenge on anyone responsible for his imprisonment.  In fact, the whole point is that the captor is planning on Oh finding out the truth, as that is the whole point of his game.  Blood will be shed and devastating revelations will make their presence felt.<br /><br />\\"Oldboy\\" is a film unlike any I have ever seen.  Rarely have I ever seen a movie so dark, brutal and unrelenting--and yet be so beautiful at the same time.  You really do feel emotionally invested.  This is not a simple shoot-em-up revenge thriller.  It is something beyond that.  It poses questions and investigates the darker side of being human.  Not once did I feel myself losing interest.  The movie is superbly directed and acted.  There is a phenomenal fight scene where it's done in one complete shot, and without it being loud or flashy.  I also have to add that this film has one of the best and most haunting music scores since \\"Requiem for a Dream.\\"<br /><br />Be warned, this isn't for everybody.  It is a dark movie and it does not let you off easy.  While it's not non-stop action and the movie focuses more on story and character, the violent scenes are really brutal.  You can watch it with an English dubbed track, but I encourage you to watch it with subtitles and see it in its original language.  Nowadays the English dubs do not do the films justice, as they change words and phrases around to make it seem more in sync with lip movement from the actors.  The Blu-Ray version of the film includes 2 disks.  There are some nice behind-the-scenes featurettes.<br /><br />\\"Oldboy\\" is a film that will leave its mark on you, no matter what your final judgment on the movie may be.  It takes \\"revenge\\" to a whole new and unexpected level and you'll have no idea where it's all leading to until the very end.  It's not for everybody, but if you're looking for something that's dark, intense, challenging and beautiful, give it a try.  You'll never look at revenge thrillers in the same way ever again.  Most likely, no other revenge thrillers will ever come close. - Michael Cranea Dream.\\"    Be warned, this isn't for everybody.  It is a dark movie and it does not let you off easy.

B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin is a very famous band. In fact its my favorite band. They play every concert in every place. The sound of Black Dog and Rock and Roll were really famous sounds. Four Sticks got its name because the drummer was playing with four sticks. Stairway to Heaven is the most famous song. It starts out with guitar and then it has drums and then it has a different beat. Its really cool. You should buy more of this and less of other Led Zeppelin cds. Going to California is great. Misty Mountain Hop I have lyrics of. In fact, I wish everyone bought Led Zeppelin IV. I have nothing more to say.    Jack - 6 years old
1400032717|4.0|Enjoyable read - quick and often a page turner.  I enjoyed the \\"fictional leap\\" the author made in writing the book from an autistic boy's perspective. I was a nanny for an autistic boy who is now in college. I could relate to the content and found the book to be insightful but not too heavy.

0439023483|5.0|The Hunger Games is one of those novels that stay with you long after you are finished reading. While most books in the YA genre are not appealing to older readers, the Hunger Games is an exception. The story is compelling, very visual and well written. By the end of the novel I truly cared for the two main characters and found myself in tears many times while reading. The violence was just disturbing enough to keep me on the edge of my seat and I would not recommend for readers under 13. I truly want to know what happens next and sincerely hope Suzanne Collins is writing a follow up.

B001GM28HO|5.0|The Fame by Lady Gaga is pop bliss to my ears and my feet. You can't help but dance up a sweat with these catchy, addictive 14 tracks. Lady Gaga has a gorgeous voice, don't expect a nasal tone like Britney, this girl can sing and write some amazing melodies. Just Dance, Poker Face, I Like It Rough, Summerboy, Paper Gansta, Boys Boys Boys, Paparazzi, and the title-track are the songs I liked right away, the rest I love as well. Money Honey and Lovegame have a great beat and Brown Eyes and Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say) are high quality ballads. This is my favorite pop album of 2008. I highly recommend it! Enjoy.
B001DJLCPO|4.0|MirrorMask is nothing short of the weirdest and most imaginative movies I have ever seen. It is also the farthest thing from a mainstream film as you can get, as 9/10 people will absolutely hate this movie. If you can get into as I did however, and appreciate all the visuals they were able to accomplish with an incredible 4-million dollar budget, then you'll appreciate the subtle humor and originality of this film, throughout the pure strangeness of it all.<br /><br />First off, this movie is purely a British production, so it highly retains a BBC-tone to the movie, and all the actors are completely unknown in the States, and by no-means stars in Britain. However, Stephanie Leonidas and Jason Barry are excellent in their roles, and really help draw you into the movie, giving you something to identify with. Because, with all the weirdness going on, it's incredibly easy to lose yourself in the film, becoming lost in the vast land of the unknown. The actors and characters therefore must keep you focused, and they do this well. Of course, if the visuals weren't enough to throw you off track, the story will. Sure, it could have been better, and it draws influences from many staples of the genre, but in-between all this, I still liked the movie.<br /><br />Maybe it's because of the subtle humor, that's both witty and hilarious. Between the flying books, and the other strange assortment of characters in this movie, you almost can't help but laugh.<br /><br />Overall, chances are you're going to hate this movie, and you wouldn't be alone. There is nothing normal about this movie, and it's part of the reason why it's so good. Sure, the film could have been cut down 15 minutes or so, and the story could have been tweaked, but you might like what you see. It's probably a one-time watching event, and who knows what Jim Henson would have thought of it. I personally think he would have loved it. It has Henson written all over it, from the characters, to the humor, to the the weirdness. I think he would have been proud.<br /><br />The Librarian: 'Take the book, if it goes back on the shelf, it'll just depress the other books, causing them to huddle together and molt.'<br /><br />Pure genius...have been proud.

B000YXMMAE|5.0|This is the best radiohead album in a while. Its not as depressing or as heavy as some others and it has a very nice flow to it. Its one of those albums that you don't like until after a few listens, but the more you listen the more you like it. I tend to put it on while I'm working, slap my earbuds in and just let it repeat.     I find it hard to list favorite songs because the have changed so many times since I purchased In Rainbows....but here goes. From the bonus cd, I love Up on the Ladder...it has a driving guitar and a nice drum that gets you tapping your toes. Faust Arp, Weird Fishes, and Videotape our some others that I seek out regularly...but the whole album is excellent. Rarely do I skip a track.     If you like radiohead and even if you don't, this is too good to pass up. Its just beautiful and well crafted. No cookie cutter songs here.

0312427999|5.0|This was a well-researched and stunning indictment of the forces shaping our world today.

The people who rated it one star probably didn't actually read the book.
0545128285|5.0|The Tales of Beedle the Bard were not intended for publication. Only 7 copies were created: for 6 lucky people close to JKR and 1 for auction. The fact that we now are able to read is a miracle by itself. So, thanks Jo. She wasn't going to do this. We ask her to.    This are fairy tales, five very well written fairy tales. Though they touch the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, it is very different from what the series were. Someone that feels disappointed by this book, probably didn't understand the concept or didn't read the description well enough. This book is even better than her other HP companion books: Quidditch Through the Ages & Fantastical Beast and Where to Find Them.    Fans of the Harry Potter series will appreciate Dumbledore's commentary on every tale, with his particular wit and sense humor. All the stories have valuable morals for young wizard kids, but they are certainly applicable to us, muggles. I'm 26 and I quite enjoyed the stories. It felt VERY nice to read about this world again. I hope we get the chance to do it again.

0956010903|5.0|I am Simply floored by this Beautiful collectors item, I expected somthing impressive but, this was above and beyond what I hoped for. I do not have wow moments often, I adimit that i'm sort of a collectables snob. That, being said, I had a serious wow moment in this case. Amazon really did the Potterfandom proud here, They went all out and it shows.<br /><br />Pictures can't really do justice to this piece, you have to hold it in your hands. To start with, The faux book that incases Beedles tales really does feel( and I mean this literally) like a tome straight off the Hogworts Library shelves. There's nothig flimzy about it, The lining is done a plush  black felt like meterial. And there is a pleasent heft to the case which adds to the real book feel. The leather alternitve used for the faux book's cover is realistic in both look and feel, and the embossing on the front cover is fantasic. On the inside cover of the faux book, there is a pocket. This is where the illustration prints are located, inside of a faux parchment envelope decorated with an inked drawing of the faux book's cover. The illustrations were a suprise to to me in that I hadn't expected them to be full sized but, indeed they are and printed on good heavy weight paper.<br /><br />The actual book is housed in deep compartment(no worries of the book falling out if the piece is stood up.) inside it's red and gold drawstring bag. but as you would expect the best part truly is the book it's self again I say pictures don't do it justice. My hope in purchasing the collecters edtion was to be able to have the fealing, which I think most avid fans want of holding a true realic of Harry's world in their hands. At the end of the day, that's exactly what it felt like. As much as I would have loved to see Bedles tales bond as they were discribed in Deathly Hallows, I have absolutely no complaints about how it turned out. One of my favorite aspects is the beautiful end papers, a small thing but it struck me. The copy of JK's handwritten introduction is a little hard to read, but worth the paitents. the begining of each story is preceeded by an illustration and followed by Dumbeldore's comentary. As well as footnotes throughout.My favoite story being The Fountain of Fair Fortune. At the end of the book there is a tuching thank you statement by Baroness Emma Nichloson, cofounder of The Children's High Level Group. If your sending this as a suprise gift be aware that the shipping box is clearly labled as to what's inside. A quick note on the clasp of the actual book it's self. not that it's poorly made but, if the book has a weak spot this might be it. one my want to avoid to much opening and closing.<br /><br />Honestly this hast to be on the shortlist of the best Potter collectables I've seen to date, plus it's a it's helping a wonderful cause. should you choose to invest in this piece I can say without hesitation that you won't regret it.ndwritten introduction is a little hard to read, but worth the paitents. the begining of each story is preceeded by an illustration and followed by Dumbeldore's comentary.

B000002J6H|5.0|First, as a Hendrix freak, I love the Hendrix/Stills jam on this album.  It reminds me of \\"Super Session\\", another gem, featuring Steve Stills on one side, and Michael Bloomfield on the other.  But Stills with Booker T., Stills with Stills, rocks.  \\"Love the One You're With\\" inspires 70's flashbacks.  How many times was that played on the radio?  The back-up singers add a lot.  The interesting arrangements and breaks take the blues farther than say, Steve Miller, and I like the SMB!  Steve Stills, like Dave Mason, peaked around this period.  What great music!  The strings, flute, congas, and horns spice the mix.  But Steve Stills wailing on acoustic guitar is the Still's signature --  \\"Black Queen\\"  This belongs in the classic rock collector's cache next to CSN, \\"Deja Vu\\", and \\"Buffalo Springfield\\".  Still's lyrics also show a strong voice, in regard to theme, I didn't intend the pun.  I've never heard another album sound like this one.
B001GKJ2FC|4.0|I just wanted to chime in real quick.  A lot of people are knocking this movie for it's overly glossy looking CGI heavy effects.  Well I thought the same thing while watching the film, but if you check out the special features you'll discover that much of what you thought was CGI was actually done by more traditional special effects that have always been around.  I was seriously impressed to discover this and much kudos has to go to the director and producers for being able to pull off so much without having to offer a sacrifice to the great CGI god.<br /><br />And seriously, this movie is not trying to be Citizen Kane or Casablanca so stop judging it like that.  It's just pure fun and adrenaline.  Seriously, do you sit there parsing every single comic book and graphic novel you read trying to figure out if it could hold up as real life?  Get over it already.  This is fantasy for crying out loud!<br /><br />Also check out the director's other works: \\"Night Watch\\" & \\"Day Watch,\\" also great fun, but again, just try not to dig too deep into the plot or you'll get a massive headache.  These movies are just meant to be thrill rides I think.  Oh BTW, don't mind the subtitles in those other 2 films.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|I've been an ABBA fan since the beginning, and loved the cast. I paid to see this movie eight times, and would have gone more if it had stayed in theatres longer! I laughed so hard, I cried, and it gave me such a euphoric feeling. Almost like being in love! The scenery, including those gorgeous actors,was an amazing sight to behold. I can't wait to have my own DVD and watch it every time I want to feel good. I grew up going to Broadway musicals, and this brought back every wonderful feeling I ever had for the genre. Thank you for making my heart sing! Better than therapy! When Julie Walters jumped up on the table to sing, I laughed so hard, I almost fell out of my chair. She was incredible! Mrs Weasley, you go, girl!
0060899220|5.0|The bad-boy of the culinary world has spoken. And he's given us insights that we probably didn't want to know about. Still, Anthony Bordain is a talented writer/speaker, and watching his show [[ASIN:B000XXWDZY No Reservations]] on the tele can help one relate to his New York Times bestseller, Kitchen Confidential.<br /><br />Being a foodie, I was intrigued and appalled at some of the kitchen practices Mr. Bourdain talks about. The no-fish-on-Mondays rule was well-known to me prior to reading this excellent take on \\"the Culinary Underbelly.\\" But with the questionable hygiene of many of my fellow restauranteurs, I was surprised to learn about the little basket of bread that oft times makes it from one table to the next, even if the previous guest had, say, a horrible cough -- avian flu?<br /><br />The no-holds-barred attitude of Kitchen Confidential might put some readers off; let's make that clear from the get-go. The cursing. The rough lifestyle. The illegal drug use. The illegal immigrants. The failure rate of the average restaurant and why they so often tank. These are things that are tough to read about but are the gritty truth of the matter, giving this tasty book an invective aftertaste that lingers long after the reader puts it down.<br /><br />What's equally impressive about it is that Bourdain doesn't even sugarcoat his own views. He's willing to show us the norm in terms of food and how it arrives on your table, but then is willing to admit that everything he just told you might be BS; someone always breaks the mold.<br /><br />There's not a single bad thing I can say about Kitchen Confidential. It appeals and appalls ...often in the same sentence. It shows us what we don't want to see but must. It gives us a glimpse of what happens to our food, from the slaughterhouse to your plate. And it cleanses your mental palette while, at the same time, soiling what you thought you once knew. In other words, a great read.
B00004RFFS|5.0|Oh, you haven't seen this movie, go ahead and do yourself the favor of buying it, you'll watch it at least once a year, but because it's Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise in your living room dressed as very lovely vampires, I predict it will be more often than that! Classic vampire movie, I never paid much attention to it until I watched it this time, but there are a lot of homosexual undertones in this film, very strong undertones. At any rate, it's very entertaining, I'd recommend buying it!
B0017U7PT6|1.0|Okay, I think it's official: director Roland Emmerich has finally hit rock-bottom. After the highly successful [[ASIN:B000HIVOI2 Stargate]], it seemed Emmerich could do no wrong. But then came [[ASIN:B000WQWPKA Independence Day]]. Not horrible but certainly not up to anything approaching Stargate quality. Then the remake, [[ASIN:0767817478 Godzilla]]. Okay. We could live with it. Perhaps a notch below Independence Day. Then came [[ASIN:B000VDDWE2 The Day After Tomorrow]]. Oh boy. We'd slipped into some ruinous territory. Bad acting. Bad story. Laughable CGI wolves. And an ending that was putrid in both the film sense and science.<br /><br />But I sucked it up and decided to give Roland another shot. I'd seen some extremely cool reviews of 10,000 BC prior to deciding on this course. But I'd seen bad reviews of movies I'd turned out to love, too. Alright, Roland, this was it. I slipped the Blu-Ray disc in and braced myself...<br /><br />Yikes! What the...! Was this supposed to be some sort of joke? I mean, I don't mind suspending disbelief when I watch a piece of fiction, but let's try and make it at least watchable! What was so bad, you might ask?<br /><br />First is you'd have to believe that prehistoric man could build temples, navigate rivers and maybe even oceans, smelt metals (come on!), and then come home and talk romantically to the love of his life. Gimme a break!<br /><br />Steven Strait ([[ASIN:B000J6I0VG Sky High]]) was given the unfortunate lead role as D'Leh, a hunter-gatherer turned warrior after the woman he loves (and will marry?) is kidnapped from his village by slave traders. D'Leh sets out to get his blue-eyed Evolet (Camilla Belle) back. He and a smattering of soon-to-be-warriors strike out across unknown territory, battling sabertooth Tigers, deadly horseback riders (???), dinosaurs (????) and D'Leh's feelings of inadequacy because of his father's abandonment of him years before (Oh yes, it's THAT bad).<br /><br />Okay, I do have to admit that the CGI/Blu-Ray transfer was nice. Particularly the representation of the Wooly Mammoths and the Sabertooth Tiger came across decent if over-the-top (the Sabertooth looked a tad bigger than I imagine they were).<br /><br />But this movie stunk; it was lust-in-the-prehistoric-dust meets cro-Magnon-with-a-conscience. Completely ridiculous and unreal. Mr. Emmerich, you've lost me.icularly the representation of the Wooly Mammoths and the Sabertooth Tiger came across decent if over-the-top (the Sabertooth looked a tad bigger than I imagine they were).

B000V4UFZK|5.0|This movie has everything, including some outdated special effects, but come on, it's an older movie, and they aren't that bad. My husband had never seen it before and started out thinking it was dumb, but by the end, he was on the edge of his seat and kept asking what happens next! The sequels to this movie aren't so great, just stick with the original!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|We recently stumbled upon Firefly via an Amazon special.  Absolutely first rate and we had to see the movie based on this (regretably) short lived TV series (same actors).  We were not disappointed.  Characters have depth, complex social interactions and engage in shoot 'em ups in space and on the ground.  I know many other people have said it, but it's worth repeating.  This is well worth watching.
031606792X|4.0|First let me say that I devoured this book. I read all four books (twice!) in 8 days. I even threw the partial draft of Midnight Sun in there as well. Having said that, I see the flaws and many of them are ones that have been mentioned here. Many readers try to say that Edward and Bella are married now, so their love should evolve into more \\"married\\" love... less sexual tension, more humdrum problems, etc. I don't quite see it the same way.     They were only married a few months through this book and most of the first 3 months were occupied with Bella dying due to her bizarre pregnancy (which, having read TONS of sci-fi and fantasy, wasn't all that bizarre, but rather expected and amusing). I mean, c'mon, if less than a week after conception she can feel the baby kick, you KNOW she's going to give birth within record time. I don't know about y'all, but the first several months of marriage were impassioned for me-- maybe even more so because of the freedom to play on that passion more than when single.     There has been criticism about her keeping the baby when Edward and Carlisle wanted to abort it-- well, DUH, it's EDWARD'S baby, of course, she isn't going to abort it! The middle book written from Jacob's point of view? That was worth it just for the chapter titles! But presenting material from another POV is always enlightening and usually interesting and so it was here. The birth and the transformation I found interesting, too. Nothing wrong with those scenes.    The long,drawn-out stand-off with the Volturi? Well, how else do you get people (vampires?) to live? Even if the Cullens et.al. won that battle, many of them would die. It seemed SM did the best she could to keep everyone alive-- after all, an old plotter like Aro would know when to bide his time, retreat, and come from another angle later (which makes more books in the future about these characters more possible).    So, ok, what problems did I have with it? Bella as a vampire... I liked her, except that after all the hype about \\"newborns\\" and their inability to resist human blood... we needed to see some of that. The only strength of character Bella has shown so far is her obsession with Edward, and even that has been compromised by her waffling over Jacob. So I was ok with her being able to \\"resist\\" some of the newborn traits, but we needed to see more struggle there. We needed to see some horror at having to kill something bare-handed and eat it raw(!). It just would have been more in keeping with the story as presented.     The relationship between Renesmee (stupid name--liked Nessie MUCH better!)and Edward... Why wasn't he as protective and fascinated with her as he has always been with Bella? She is a part of Bella, has Bella's eyes, is exceptionally gifted... where's that Daddy fascination? Nessie seemed more attached to Jacob than her dad or mom and that really bothered me.     The relationship between Edward and Bella... For someone he has been so protective of for two years, you'd think he would have more trouble letting go of that. And even barring that because she is at the moment physically stronger than he, where is the fierceness of his love and pride in her? He has been fascinated by all things Bella from the start and he STILL can't read her mind (until she lets him in the end), so where is that aspect of their relationship?    I so wanted Bella to kick Jacob's butt for the imprinting on Renesmee thing! But, no, Seth has to step in and now there's more apologies...    Most of all, I missed the relationship between Edward and Bella. Just because people marry (and I thought it incredibly sweet that he didn't want to have sex until they were married, even if he was just afraid of hurting her, because, after all, he did die in 1918) doesn't mean they give up all those feelings they had prior to the marriage. The great tension, attraction between them was missing in this book and it was what hurt the book the most.    I hope SM revisits these characters through Renesmee in the future. I still liked them VERY much.

Especially the episode the Mysterious Spot ( I would have given it a better title ;3) Check it out, it's diffently a worth watch.  The actors who play the brothers are tremendous and have given the characters Sam and Dean a memorable and awesom appeal I'm sure this show will soon become an instant classic. ;0)

0375826726|4.0|This book is well written and inventive.  Taking MULTIPLE cues from tales like The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, it is clearly a recipe that has been proven as successful in the past.  Filled with action as well as character building, the book is certainly worth a read.  However, there are times where it seems slow moving due to the immense amount of detail poured into it.  There are sections where this detail becomes overwhelming and the book bogs down.  However, as I said before the book is great and if you remotely enjoyed the first two, it is worth the money to add this to your collection as well.

Bought this $100 version as a Christmas present for my wife, spending the extra $92.05 in these lean times for the pleasure of surprising her with it on Christmas morning. The surprise was on me, however, when it arrived yesterday in a box clearly and colorfully and extravagantly and unmistakably printed all over \\"The Tales of Beedle the Bard\\" with cutesy messages to muggles about not opening it before December 4th. Infuriating -- not least because it arrived on December 5th. I'm so angry that I would return it, but too late for even that small gesture. Thanks a lot, amazon.com. Over 11 years and 579 transactions, you've never let me down before -- but this one is a doozy.

0545128285|5.0|Having just finished reading this book, I am amazed by the perfect tone and style of it.  Though tiny, compared with the monolithic Deathly Hallows, this little collection of Wizarding fairytales and fables bears a relation to the seven Harry Potter books similar to the relation Tolkien's The Hobbit bears to his Ring Trilogy.  Perhaps The Silmarilion might be a more apt comparison, since Beadle is presented as folklore, just as The Silmarilion is.  Anyway, more Silmarilion-like histories may emerge from the pen of J.K.Rowling in the future.<br /><br />I am most delighted in the stories themselves.  Young readers will find an insight into the moral attitudes of J. K. Rowling, especially through the voice of Albus Dumbledore, who serves as the author's voice all through the Harry Potter stories, even as Hermione Granger probably allows Rowling to participate in the action by proxy!  Dumbledore's whimsical style is particularly conducive to laying moral observations on the reader without fear of giving offense, since a great wizard such as Dumbledore can be permitted a few eccentricities, especially as the wizard concerned is, in the final analysis, a humble human being --even if he cannot be accused of false modesty.  (Humility and modesty are quite distinct attributes, I have learned.)<br /><br />A particularly charming tale is of the Fortune Fountain.  (The actual title of the story is a triumph of alliteration, which I shall forgo the pleasure of wallowing in.)  I wish I had the talent to invent such a tale myself!  It is so simple, romantic, beautiful and warm, yet appears to be a story anyone could have put together!  What a jewel!<br /><br />The story of Babbitty Rabbitty is charming comic relief, even if the wit is rather barbed.  There are three more stories, including the one that figures prominently in Hallows, enough to give anyone good measure for their investment.  As always, Margaret DuPre's art is perfect for the purpose, and I for one am pleased to take this opportunity to express my gratitude for the gorgeous style and texture her art contributes to my enjoyment of the Potter books.  If I were the right age, my childhood would surely have been defined by the entire Potter literary event.<br /><br />Finally, it appears that all net proceeds from Beadle go towards the Children's High Level Group, a charity co-established by Jane Rowling.  This gesture is one that is appreciated, and cannot be more appropriate, both for the author, and for her many admirers.<br /><br />Archimedespress my gratitude for the gorgeous style and texture her art contributes to my enjoyment of the Potter books.

B0014I4KIK|5.0|She's the best of 60's r&b, and all her own brand new sound.  I wore out this CD, because every single song is fantastic.  I went to her homepage, and her newest song is hot! She's spotlighted in a little black suit, has dancers surrounding her. I hope she continues to make music because she is unlike anyone else, and has a voice that is hard to describe, but is emotional and articulate.   Her video of \\"Warwick Avenue\\" was tremendous, and added another layer of complexity to her that sold me. If that was acting, she's damn good.
B000XUUQQK|3.0|Boogeyman 2 (Jeff Betancourt, 2007)<br /><br />Betancourt's straight-to-video sequel to the Sam Raimi-produced Boogeyman is a minor surprise in that it's actually watchable (more so, in fact, than its predecessor). Both director Betancourt, who previously did editing work on such films as The United States of Leland and the superlative The Exorcism of Emily Rose, and screenwriter Brian Sieve were first-timers. So how is it that they turned out a better flick than the vets who did the first one? We may never know, but I'm glad they did.<br /><br />The story: Laura Porter (Danielle Savre, recently of Kaya) and her brother Henry (South of Nowhere's Matt Cohen), as children, saw the Boogeyman murder their parents. Fast-forward ten years, and Henry is a complete mess. Or he was. He's been in intensive therapy for a while, and he's getting out--a new man with a job interview lined up and a fresh outlook on life. In fact, therapy helped him so much that he suggests Laura, who's always been the strong one, might benefit from a bit of it. Between Henry and his doctor, Jessica Ryan (Xena: Warrior Princess' Renee O'Connor), she's convinced, and signs on. Problem is, she's not alone. It seems the Boogeyman considers Laura unfinished business, and that fact that there's a wing full of nubile, yet mentally disturbed, teens standing between the Boogeyman and Laura just makes the prospect all the more enticing.<br /><br />Needless to say, the result is a pastiche of amusing and inventive death scenes, but patching them together is a glue that actually contains halfway interesting characters who act like humans rather than cardboard cutouts. Sure, you have your stereotypes and some minor characters who can't act their ways out of a collective paper bag, but still, it's head and shoulders above the first movie, and really, those death scenes are all sorts of fun. ***

B001ECQ75A|4.0|Kung Fu Panda (Mark Osborne and John Stevenson, 2008)<br /><br />I've put off writing my Kung Fu Panda review for so long that the DVD is now out. Oops. I did originally see it in the theaters, and I liked it a great deal more than I thought I was going to, given the voice talent in it, but I never quite liked it as much as everyone else seemed to. And thus I've been trying to write this review on and off since I was wishing for the kinds of temperatures we have now. (Stupid me, I never learn. I'm pining for ninety-degree days again.)<br /><br />Osborne (until now best known for his Weird Al Yankovic video \\"Jurassic Park\\") and Stevenson (responsible for the fine, and all too short-lived, TV show Father of the Pride) give us the tale of Po (Jack Black), a somewhat lazy panda whose sole desire is to be a martial artist like his heroes, the Furious Five. Instead, however, he spends his time working at the noodle house owned by his adoptive father, Mr. Ping (James Hong). When the Furious Five's temple has an open house, the whole town turns out, and Mr. Ping sends Po to sell noodles at the gathering. Through a series of misadventures, Po finds himself tasked with becoming a Kung Fu master. Meanwhile, the evil warlord Tai Lung (Ian McShane) has escaped from captivity--can Po be the one to stop him?<br /><br />It's a fun movie, entertaining for both kids and adults alike. The main reason it surprises me that I think so is because so much of the voice talent is provided by people who either can't act (Black. Angelina Jolie and Seth Rogen voicing two of the Furious Five) or who aren't actors at all (Osborne and Stevenson both chime in, as well as production supervisor Jeremy Shipp, producer Melissa Cobb, and a handful of others who usually work behind the scenes). And yet it all came out very well. Is it, as I've seen it called, the best animated feature since the Lion King? No, I don't think so--all of the movies Pixar made during its reign as the best studio on the planet have fallen in between these--but it's certainly worth viewing if you haven't seen it yet. The humor is decidedly adult (in that it's not \\"playing down\\" to the tween/teen set with potty humor and jokes that will make parents groan), the story is inspiring, and the animation is exceptionally well-done. It may not go down in history as one of the best movies ever, but it's well worth a rental now that the DVD is out, and if you get a chance to catch it on the big screen and you never did, it's worth a look. *** ½these--but it's certainly worth viewing if you haven't seen it yet.

B001EOQWF8|5.0|Let me 1st say the picture quality of the blu ray version is phenomenal and I would say the overall quality is the sharpest ever for an animated movie.  I would look closely at certain shots like at the beginning with Wall E at Earth cleaning up b/c its far by the best looking garbage I have seen.<br /><br />The 1st time I watched it with my three and a half year old and my twenty month old and they watched about the 1st thirty minutes and they were done never to look at it again.  They simply did not care for this movie and I think they enjoyed the beginning b/c the music and whats going on plays together and Wall E has a certain silliness at the beginning.  That is kind of where my three stars come from since my kids really didn't enjoy it that much and neither did I.  I would say it was cute but not great.  I would say rent it just to see it on blu ray and who knows maybe your kids will like it.<br /><br />As I watched it I am pretty sure there are a few political themes in the movie as well as parts that I said \\"hey that might offend sensitive people\\" not me though b/c I really didn't care.  That kind of stuff doesn't bother me but I found myself wondering why humans would create robots that would have emotional responses to each other than again I could be thinking to much since this is a kids movie.<br /><br />I did like hearing the robots speak though and Wall E had that funny kind of stuff like you would see a kid do like put a bra on their face since they don't know what its for.The emotional response of the robots was conveyed pretty good simply by their eye work.<br /><br />I guess this movie is good as long as you don't think about everything too much like me since it is a kids movie.<br /><br />I meant to give this movie 3 stars and I went back to fix it from the 5 but I can't so thats my explanation.
B0002KQNJU|3.0|The Fearless Vampire Killers (Roman Polanski, 1968)<br /><br />Supposedly, Roman Polanski disowned this film not long after making it. Forty years later, it's probably best remembered as one of the six films in which Sharon Tate had a credited role before her untimely death. (She had uncredited roles in three more.) Oddly, it was the only film on which Polanski and Tate, who were married in January of 1968, ever made together.<br /><br />Plot: Professor Abronsius, an expert on bats (The Exorcist's Jack McGowran), and his assistant Alfred (Polanski) head to Eastern Europe to try and prove that vampires exist. The local innkeeper's daughter (Tate) catches both their eyes, as well as everyone else's--including those of Count von Krolock (the late, great Ferdy Mayne), the local lord. And, of course, vampire. So now the Professor and Alfred are pretty sure vampires exist, but have to figure out how to get the best of one in order to rescue the lady fair.<br /><br />It's an amusing little piece, though it does have its problems. Most of them have to do with the film's pace, which is inconsistent much of the time. The rest of them have to do with the fact that for a comedy, The Fearless Vampire Killers takes itself awfully seriously some of the time. Not all the time, thankfully, and when Polanski is having as much fun as everyone else, the film really shines (the ball is probably the best example of this).<br /><br />The Fearless Vampire Killers was remarkably hard to find for a while, but 2004 saw a DVD release, and the movie has been easily available since. It's worth checking out. ***
B00013RC8O|5.0|I had been searching for this video. It was just what I was looking for!
B001641ZFS|5.0|It is wonderul that such a seasoned and experienced conductor such as Claudio Abbado has found something fresh to bring to the Original Instrument scene.  His new 'Orchestra Mozart' is simply stunning. The two titles available now, the five Violin Concertos with the Sinfonia Concertante, as well as Sym. 29, 33, 35, 38 and 41 are amongst the best Mozart I've ever heard.  Phrases are shaped but not clipped, lean but not emaciated. Tempos are quicker than we've been used to in this rep (except with some of the more radical HIP conductors), but fit the overall conception of each piece. Violinist Giuliano Carmignola plays with little vibrato but a wonderfully sweet tone and perfect intonation. His grasp and vision of the music fits well with Abbado's. I still love Stern and Grumiaux, as well as Mustonen and Manze, but these new performances are top drawer. The Sinfonia is among the best available as well, particularly the entracing  C minor Andante.  The booklet contains a very interesting interview with Carmignola, a name I was unfamiliar with until now.  And Abbado - what can you say about the greatest living conductor.  His sytlistic re-birth into a new way to hear this music (call it 'post-HIP') is nothing short of inspirational, especially with one already so mature and confident in his vision. Whatever rep he conducts these days always seems just right in his hands, and his dedication to a full realization of the composer's intentions is beyond criticism (and I'm not just talking about his inclusion of a composer's specified repeat). It goes without saying that the sonics are superb (listen to the hushed pianissimo in the Andante to Sym K201). You must obtain both these releases.

B00008O89K|4.0|This disc features original recordings from the film as composed by the very talented Basil Poledouris.  The themes are grandiose and inspiring.  The performance is fresh and energetic, if not technically perfect.  My biggest criticism with this disc lies in the rather poor production values (even by 1982 standards).  There is an apparent delay between microphones that creates some unpleasant side-effects.  The equalization is off, lending the album a somewhat harsh and 'tinny' sound.  And finally, there is a lot of 'hiss' and 'room sound' in the recording.    If you can look past these imperfections and focus on the music itself, you will be greatly satisfied.  If you have sensitive ears or critical sensibilities, you may be disappointed.    It's also worth noting that this particular version has 12 tracks, instead of the 16 available from another edition that has the same cover art and appears on the surface to be completely identical.  Check the track listing before you buy...    All things considered I would recommend this disc to fans of Basil Poledouris, or to Conan film buffs who want the original recordings.  I've heard newer recordings with better production values that nonetheless fail to capture the fresh and passionate character that pervades this older recording.  As always, your best bet is to listen to the sample tracks and compare alternatives before buying...

0316017922|3.0|`Outliers', while not being the best of Mr. Gladwell's books, still stands out as one of the best Holiday books this year.  The central thesis is that one's success or lack of success depends more on where you are from, rather then your inherent I.Q. or smarts.  In and of itself, this is idea is nothing new.  However, Americans like to believe in the myth of the `rugged individualist\\" that pulls himself or herself up by the bootstraps for this is a part of the American credo.  Of course, Mr. Gladwell takes great pleasure in debunking this myth, while arguing that while brains are important, they more often then not take a back seat to the environment you grew up in, where your ancestors were from and what kind of culture you come from.  Again, this is hardly a new thesis, but Mr. Gladwell delivers this in a witty book that can be read over any weekend or on a long flight.<br /><br />The weakness of `Outliers' comes in the very beginning when the author describes the small town of Roseto in Northeastern Pennsylvania.  Mr. Gladwell purports that this community of Italian immigrants has a lack of heart disease and other kinds of ailments because they are a close knit community.  The point that he is trying to make is that an individuals success is predicated upon his environment.  While he demonstrates that much more convincingly in other chapters, this is an odd way to start this book.  What makes it even stranger, is that Mr. Gladwell never returns to Roseto for the duration of the book.  However, despite sloppy organization and well worn thesis, `Outliers' is still an interesting short read.
B001EOQWFI|3.0|Very imaginative movie which greats graphics yet a dark and ominous over tone about the future of the human race. Plus, the fact that the Earth is no longer capable of support life is interesting yet a little dull at times.      I like the movie and I give it thumbs up, but Disney/Pixer needs to up their standards on the production of the DVDs they release to the consumer markets.  I have had nothing but problems with my copy of Wall-e on my Blu Ray player.  It's stops and freezes randomly throughout the movie which really ticks me off and I do not have that issue with any other blu-ray movie I own.  I have even tried to clean the lens in the player.    HOWEVER, Blu Ray player owners need to remember that on most Blu-Ray players (mine is Sony) you can upgrade the Fireware to the latest version which helps with load speeds, compatibility issues and software bugs soooo please check with the support site of your Blu-Ray player manufacturer.  The latest Sony is from 10/31/08 and they typically release new version about every 2 months so keep up with it.  Sony provides a disc image that you will burn to a CD and then you place it in the disc player and it upgrades.  Its very easy.

B001C08RHA|4.0|I think that movie makers have to wait till the technology is there to produce a certain movie that might require sophisticated effects and not just wait for a good script and have the technology (if not mature enough) ruin the film.  George Lucas did it with his Star Wars prequels and the producers of Iron Man chose to do it the same way too.  The movie is a combination of a good script (many times side-lined in such movies) and very good special effects.  Robert Downey proved he is a good actor in this movie by getting in the right shape required and as usuall living the role.  Overall another Marvel hit which I'm sure will encourage Marvel to bring more and more of their superheros onto the big screen.

B0014Z4OQG|2.0|What could have turned out to be one of the best giant monster films of recent years, turns out to be a very frustrating movie experience. OK, I totally get what the producers of this film were trying to do with the mock video style of the film. Unfortunately, it doesn't work most of the time. Some situations were completely contrived and didn't feel true at all. This totally goes against what the filmmakers were trying to conceive.<br /><br />The biggest problem with trying to make this look like it's really happening is.... we know it's fake! No matter what you do with or what camera you use, it's never going to be taken as real, So why not make the same movie only with good actors and using real cameras? The idea is good enough to stand up to a traditional style of film making. The image stabilization is really trying at times and really becomes more of a distraction rather than a useful tool. It would have been better to make the film in  normal process and switch to the video style in segments, like when a news cameraman is filming real news. It would have saved everyone a headache and we would get that down in the thick of it feeling that worked in this film.<br />I did enjoy this movie, but I was equally frustrated, because I think they really missed a great opportunity to make a fantastic monster film!<br />The DVD transfer is very good and there are a few interesting extras.
B001JRYH2K|5.0|As much as I can not wait for this to be finally released on DVD in the U.S.A., I will be somewhat sad that it is only a standard DVD, not the expected 25th Anniversary 2-disc edition. This film is a milestone to American cinema in the same vein as other classics that may not be as deserving but get the luxury DVD treatment regardless (in particular, a lot of Criterion collection titles that get an excellent DVD edition, even if the movies might just be curiosity items).     I hope that this edition is just a warm-up, and that a more inclusive edition with lots of behind-the-scenes shorts, commentaries and documentaries (like the one shown on TV back in 1983 about the making of the movie) will be released not far from now.     Still, how FANTASTIC that we are finally getting YENTL on DVD. Oh, how I like the way YENTL makes me feel.

B00007BH5C|5.0|This filmscore/soundtrack is (chiefly) classical program music and a huge tone poem of the First Water. All the music on this CD was composed, orchestrated, conducted, and produced by Howard Shore. I thought long and hard prior to reviewing this work because I have some definite issues with it, which I'll discuss in just a bit - but the bottom line is that with this CD you get your money's worth and it's really a fine collection. First, I wish to provide some background details of the original story and of the music.<br /><br />For the uninitiated, \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" (by J.R.R. Tolkien) is an adult fantasy tale of good versus evil in a land called Middle Earth where all manner of creatures exist and interact. \\"The Two Towers\\" is the second entry of the LOTRs trilogy where \\"men,\\" (as opposed to elves, dwarves, and hobbits), are introduced in a major way into the chronicle. The filmscore here includes some themes from the first film (\\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\") and incorporates some new ones as well.<br /><br />The orchestra here is nothing less than the much-renowned London Philharmonic, spot-on in their rendering of the work and yielding near-perfection in this instance in my opinion. The vocals include The Voices of London, The Oratory School Schola Boys' Choir, Isabel Bayrakdarian, Ben Del Maestro, Elizabeth Fraser, and Emiliana Torrini. Dermot Crehan is featured playing a Norwegian fiddle called a \\"hardinger\\" and fine work it is. Other unique orchestral ethnic instruments featured herein include the rhaita (Jan Hendrickse), cimbalom, dilruba, log drums, and wood xylophones.<br /><br />To describe the overall work in general terms, it's characteristically broad with not a lot of instrumental solos, often highlighting expansive sweeping strings, big horns booming out bass scales, and pounding and assertive timpani. I listen to classical music 24/7 (and especially to movie soundtracks) and here, I detected numerous superlative trends and techniques of Stravinsky, Debussy, Loeffler, Elgar, Orff, Hovhaness, Gowers, and G&oacute;recki, albeit Shore has his own well-stuffed bag of tricks and I think that my notations are just reflective of the influence of at least most of these great composers on Shore himself. Not many of the movements end as they begin, if any at all do so.<br /><br />Ultimately, three hours of music were used in this film and only 72:24 of it is found on this CD (more on this later, the producers forgot to list any times on the liner notes or rear cover!). It was recorded in 2002 (post-film production) at the Coliseum at the Watford Town Hall (19 miles northwest of London, England). And to clear up a muddy point in advance, many of the solo vocal renderings are yielded up by the singers in Tolkien's \\"made-up\\" languages from the original book, and are therefore unintelligible (the final track excepted). The \\"translations\\" (into English) are found in the CD liner notes.<br /><br />One point came to my mind right off: Howard Shore must have had to discipline himself against an unceasing temptation to configure every piece of music in this film to the likes of traditional Irish folk tunes and reels. You'll find some of this ethnically-familiar music inserted, here and there, but that hurdle was cleared nicely, much to the benefit of the film and similarly to the listener I might add. I made copious notations as I listened (many times) to the CD and I have listed a number of my thoughts here (BTW, I don't read a note of music so if I have misused some terms, just please take them as a lay person would express them):<br /><br />Track 1, (3:51) \\"Foundations of Stone\\" - Big horns; broad, flowing strings; lumbering percussion, and; a \\"Carmina Burana-type\\" chorus and vocals.<br /><br />Track 2, (2:48) \\"The Taming of Sm&eacute;agol\\" - \\"The Hobbit\\" main theme (clarinet) is up front; atmospheric chorus; tense strings; a transition into big percussion and bass notes on horns.<br /><br />Track 3, (4:05) \\"The Riders of Rohan\\" - An action theme, chiefly of horns; a decrescendo and a return to a string crescendo; this leads into a medieval ambiance.<br /><br />Track 4, (2:45) \\"The Passage of the Marshes\\" - (one of my two favorite movements) A spectacular vision of ancient magnificence... horns first, then a solo violin (hardinger), then more horns and strings; a change of key and more musical tension; more key changes over the course of this track.<br /><br />Track 5, (2:58) \\"The Uruk-hai\\" - A variation of yet another familiar action theme... a canon, really; totally orchestral; then, a big but brief reprise of Track 4 and subsequently into a brisk Doomsday march.<br /><br />Track 6, (3:48) \\"The King of the Golden Hall\\" - A staccato percussion laid against big horns, ending abruptly into a lightly played second reprise of Track 4 (solo violin).<br /><br />Track 7, (3:17) \\"The Black Gate Is Closed\\" - Another apprehensive action piece and then to a less assertive development in the minor key with a hallowed chorus; a series of orchestral crescendos; a rondo of strings and a change of key.<br /><br />Track 8, (3:15) \\"Evenstar\\" - Another favorite of mine. This piece opens with Isabel Bayrakdarian singing a beautifully melodic Celtic theme in the minor key.<br /><br />Track 9, (2:28) \\"The White Rider\\" - Embarks much like the opening chorus in the 4th movement of Beethoven's 9th; then to some playing of scales, with switching from the minor key to the major; then back to the minor.<br /><br />Track 10, (2:43) \\"Treebeard\\" - Opens with the dreadful F#-C exchange (or possibly transposed in another key); then, to a Stravinsky-ish \\"Rite of Spring\\" sacrificial maiden march.<br /><br />Track 11, (3:34) \\"The Leave Taking\\" - A chorus rendering a premise that's just a bit ripped-off from a late-period \\"Star Trek\\" film, morphing into something of an arabesque; then, a dreary manifestation of an orchestral series of key changes, all in the minor keys.<br /><br />Track 12, (3:52) \\"Helm's Deep\\" - Big horns, big timpani, the latter in a syncopated presentation; enter the echo of a chorus chanting scales; a decrescendo and a re-building of the Track 4 theme; enter another Enya-type Irish theme.<br /><br />Track 13, (5:27) \\"The Forbidden Pool\\" - A diminutive opening in the minor key which somewhat escalates via some bass-note work from the cello section.<br /><br />Track 14, (5:07) \\"Breath of Life\\" (featuring Sheila Chandra) - An unintelligible mantra (I mean this in a positive sense); ultimately to a galloping horn, string, and woodwind crescendo, then a decrescendo.<br /><br />Track 15, (4:36) \\"The Hornburg\\" - More of the Track 4 theme; a brief trumpet solo preceding a chorus of vocals.<br /><br />Track 16, (3:15) \\"Forth Eorlingas\\" (featuring Ben Del Maestro) - The chorus opens with a light chant, building to a point of climax where the orchestra again reprises the Track 4 theme, and then on to another of the main LOTR themes.<br /><br />Track 17, (5:00) \\"Isengard\\" (featuring Elizabeth Fraser and Ben Del Maestro) - Fraser open the piece which evolves to simply more pounding scales; then back to a sort of coda-length segment of the Track 4 theme; then, more Fraser and Maestro.<br /><br />Track 18, (3:44) \\"Samwise the Brave\\" - An old English folk tune rendered as a flute solo at the opening, (a variation of a prevalent LOTRs theme, ultimately correcting to the actual chief LOTRs theme).<br /><br />Track 19, (5:51) \\"Gollum's Song\\" (featuring Emiliana Torrini) - This is the final work of the CD - Torrini seems somewhat out-of-place (or perhaps it's that the actual music does) against its peer tunes... it's really not classical music at all. The lyrics are half-whispered, half-sung and the underpinning is reminiscent of a Jim Morrison (The Doors) ballad. It's the only song on the CD where the words are sung distinctly in modern English. The track ends with a very nice version of the Track 4 notion.<br /><br />Now, to address my three minor reservations/concerns aboutthis CD:<br /><br />1. If you want all the music from this film you'll have to purchase this pricey work: [[ASIN:B000IZJZIK The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers (The Complete Recordings)]]. This was indeed a disappointment when I discovered that I had been \\"shorted\\"; however, I must reiterate that I did in fact get my money's worth on this CD, given the low price - I was just disappointed that a particular piece of music that I especially loved was missing!<br /><br />2. The last track, \\"Gollum's Song\\" really just does not fit in with the rest of the music. There are many people who clearly love this song and I don't challenge their right to enjoy it -- it's just that I see it as an incongruous entry on this heavily edited CD. I would not be much concerned with this had the producers of the CD soundtrack (Howard Shore may not have had the final say) not redundantly injected the theme from Track 4 so many times, taking up a lot of the CD space. In fact, I think that Howard Shore would have been far ahead to farm out the Gollum composition in its entirety (he collaborated) to a single writer who regularly works in this genre of music. In the end, I wish they would have just included more classical movements, eliminating this one from the abbreviated CD. But since they didn't, like most of my CDs, there's seems to always be at least one track that I don't care for so I really can't complain all that much on this issue. And as I said, there are plenty of folks who really savor this tune.<br /><br />3. My biggest concern is that Shore did not use Isabel Bayrakdarian nearly enough. While the other vocalists are quite good, they're not even in the same universe with Bayrakdarian as far as I'm concerned. She's a rising soprano of infinite talent and she really shines here (all too briefly!) as she particularly does with one of her recent phenomenal CDs: [[ASIN:B000641ZEK Isabel Bayrakdarian ~ Cleopatra]]<br /><br />Finally, this is an \\"enhanced\\" audio CD with bonus multi-media content which will run on most computers - it does make an internet connection when you engage this feature.<br /><br />That's about it.

B0014Z4OQG|5.0|Cloverfield is a technical marvel, the special effects are top notch as a monster from an unknown place just appears in New York and begins to tear it apart before the stunned members of a party who then split apart to try to escape or find their friends who are trapped in the city.<br /><br />I think the film is full of high suspense, edge of your seat fun. The trailer image of the head of the statue of liberty coming off is sure to go down in movie history. The production is done from the point of view of a camcorder that one of the party members has. So the entire film is done in first person POV. I found this really interesting and fun but the rollercoaster effect might not be pleasurable for all but aside from that possible weakness, this film is sheer monster madness. The film makers are having a bunch of fun having people running scared as this massive fiend rips buildings apart and shakes the ground, pounds the army and gets it back just as rough. It is like one big extended action sequence throughout its whole running time. If you like this sort of thing, then go for it. I think it tends to be the type of film that some people like a lot or not at all. It could be one of the best monster flicks you will ever see though if you do like this kind of movie.
B000026FOA|5.0|The title of this album is truly indicative of the album; for me it has a very lost in the forest feel to it. Nick Drake creates an ambiance that you are either drawn into or you totally reject; so I suppose, you might want to preview a song to see if he speaks to your heart or not. I believe he should be studied and revered. There is a tonal depth in Drake's music that I've not heard often, and sadly, his death is a reminder of just how far into the abyss he was travelling on his own, I do feel that you can feel his melancholy in the music. I Love Nick Drake's music and rather than make me sad, his guitar and vocals merely tame my own melancholy into a more serene place where music is the carnival and all the rides are free.

1582701709|1.0|I read this book last year when it first came out on a tip from a friend. I sat down with it in the bookstore, intrigued and wanting to know... what is this secret? Ten minutes later I was audibly laughing out loud and even causing people to look. I contemplated standing up and hurling it across the room saying, \\"This book illuminates everything that's wrong with our culture!\\" I assumed most people would get the gist. They haven't. I had no idea that so much of the world was ignorant to the power of positive thinking. This must be the real reason for all suffering that continues to go on. I must be poor because I haven't believed that someday I will be rich beyond my dreams. I must not be married because I haven't wished for it hard enough. Shallowness runs up ahead and clangs the bell! Continuing, if one is to follow the premise of the book completely, then all poor, unhealthy, unattractive and overweight people, anyone not fitting the mold of a magazine covers constraints should be pushed aside, ignored, and pretty much discounted. This will illiminate 90% of the world's population and take away any sense of soul saving qualities such as empathy and compassion for your neighbor; but at least you'll be richer, thinner and prettier--the ultimate meaning of life, eh?
B0006SSOHC|5.0|\\"Saw\\" is one of those movies that divides its viewers straight down the line in opinions. You either love it or hate it. Most people that dislike it will say because it's too gruesome and twisted for them. That's understandable, because \\"Saw\\" is one of the definitive in the infamous but small, \\"torture horror\\" subgenre. So that explains why people would dislike it, but what about the people that like it?  Well I, for one, loved this movie, and here's why: \\"Saw\\" is not just a movie about people getting thrown in a room and slicing their legs off with giant blades or else their friends will get decapitated. No, \\"Saw\\" is actually a lot more than just a \\"torture\\" horror film.  If you manage to look past the gruesome violence of this movie, what lies beneath is actually a very intelligent crime film, like a really good episode of \\"Law and Order\\" or \\"NYPD Blue\\", just with harsher graphic content.  This movie also shows us the villain's ideals. It tries to convince us that Jigsaw, the villain of the movie, is actually not a serial killer and just goes about showing people the value of life in his own, twisted way.  A lot of the movie is also a flashback to the police-story behind it, whereas the present in the movie takes places where two guys are chained down and locked into a room, set to a timer.  This \\"Saw\\" is actually a little less graphic than any of its following sequels, save for a gory headshot and sawing through your own ankle. But what this movie lacks in the heavier gore of its sequels, it makes up for in its exciting suspense and smart film-making.  Overall, \\"Saw\\" is one of those movies that you have to give a chance before you decide whether you like it or not. I'm sure glad I gave it a chance, because it showed me that rumors and popular talk can trick you into thinking whether or not a movie is good, or something like that.  But anyway, if you want a great horror movie, mixed in with some crime and thriller elements, give this a shot. You may just end up loving it. Thanks for the time, and peace.
B000025H0Q|5.0|I own the Nick Drake Trilogy; and this is not as good as Pink Flamingo. this is in my own opinion and someone else, may like this one more than the others. The three cd's are necessary for all acoustic guitar players and afficionado's, even if you're not. Stylistically, Drake is a revolutionary and no one can touch him. Sure, this album does sound a bit heavy, but as far as I'm concerned, Drake's creativity and sheer brilliance overshadow this minor predicament. Well worth the pitifully low price of this cd.
B00008PX8P|5.0|What can I say about this DVD that hasn't already been said? It's Led Zeppelin, live, loud and all-powerful, rocking us at the high level only they reached. The songs are all top notch, the performances are insane, and there's hours of footage that will never stop blowing your mind!  I already knew that Led Zeppelin where masters at what they do, but this practically redefined their level of excellency for me! Hammer of the gods, indeed! When you hear the bludgeoning opening riff to \\"Immgrant Song\\", it's more like a giant, plugged-in sledgehammer!  From their pounding, electric anthems to their amazing, mellower pieces, this DVD has it all, and shows Led Zeppelin performing at the top of their game, proving that whatever they do, they do it great. It shows their wide variety of styles that they blend together to make their own sound, and this DVD is a testament to one of rock's all-time greatest bands in their prime.  Hope you all have lots of fun with this one! \\"Led Zeppelin\\" is one that will never get old, and I'd even say it beats out \\"The Song Remains The Same\\". So if you liked that one, watch out, because this one will rock you again! Long live the mighty rock leviathan that is Led Zeppelin! Thanks for the time, and peace.
0671799320|5.0|This book was published in 1992 so it doesn't contain information beyond the Bush presidency and into the 21st Century.  What it contains is the history of the use of oil as a means of energy and light.  While Oil does appear in the background of many history textbooks, its history is ignored even as it gradually takes over the lives of most on the planet Earth.  This book covers the period in which oil is discovered to be a better source of light than whale oil and cheap enough to be used by the general public.  Kerosene changes lives.  No longer do people feel force to go to bed once the sun goes down and rise when it comes up, but to actually do somethings at night especially in the rural areas.  The danger of transporting kerosene pails in the light of profits and a better standard of living.  Later the internal combustion engine is invented using oil as the combustion source and oil takes flight.  This book is also great at revealing how the World Wars were able to expand and focus on greater transportation, weapons and technology due to the expanding use of oil.  It also affected where people fought and what they fought over.  The lack of oil may have helped damn the Nazis from taking over all of Europe.  This book is very good at explaining how oil has affected lives.  The details on the Carter Administration and the Gulf War are fascinating.  This book won a well deserved Pulitzer Prize for Non-Fiction.  I highly recommend it and would like to see the PBS series also.
B000F8O2OM|5.0|I never got to see the series except the last year. I am glad these are available. They are a good escape and you enjoy the comradarie.

Certifiable, Death Magnetic, Accelerate, Vapor Trails, Icky Thump.........the loudness wars are ruining music and makes buying CDs too much of a gamble.    No, I don't mean how loud the music was at the concert, if i want great music cranked loud know what i do ? i use the VOLUME knob !!!!    No, the loudness wars refer to the mastering levels.    Another victim, R.I.P recorded music.....    [...]
B000I0QM0E|4.0|This is easily my favorite Tim Burton movie but I must admit that the Blu ray transfer looks horrible. The faces are so grainy it makes it tough to watch.  I put my regular DVD of this movie into my sony Blu ray and had it up coverted and it looked better than the Blu ray.  Back to the drawing board guys !
B001GKYBXA|5.0|YES!!  One of Macca's BEST albums..ever, deserves a Grammy nod.Seriously a must have,must buy, must listen too! This album offers so much.. you'll know what I'm talkin about when you buy the album.. the Album is Superb!!!heheh   Macca & Youth knocked it outta the park!!! I bought the deluxe version via the Fireman website and cannot wait for the 7 track CD that includes re-mixes, and different versions of some tracks..Some of these tracks you do not want to end!Love Electric Arguments!!   hb~
B000Q67876|5.0|If you are a fan of this movie, then check out the Blu-ray release. It looks stunning.  Well worth owning again.
B000KWZ7VU|5.0|Excellent. Playing 32 Beethoven sonatas in few concerts  it is just incredible, it is live concert, then you cant expect 100% of perfection, but I recall one  Barenboim concert in Valencia, he was playing Liszt, it was amazing, one of the best concert of my life. You were there or not .These DVDs are for people that didn't have the  choice to be in Berlin to enjoy  these 8 concerts. We can loose long time discussing how Beethoven sounds (neither Beethoven new how it sound it self ) or expend your time listening  to this great job (gift) from Barenboim. You will find an \\"old\\" Barenboim enjoining  his playing and playing for himself, nowadays   he don t have anything to demonstrate. He is a Master.  There are many ways to understand music, this is not for people that think that music is a competition, or a race or they expect the pianist to be like a monkey in a circus. This is for people who believe that music is written and played for soul an feelings. I really like many piano players, but  Barenboim  contribution on classical music  is it s just great.  There will be only  one Barenboim....just how he performs last movement of  Tempest  he deserves immortality.    8 great concerts,  32 sonatas ,  a moment of music, a gift.  Enjoy it.
B001AQUR7O|4.0|A wonderful collection of Sade's music. The best of the best,and a really good CD for just relaxing, or a little romancing.
B00004WF68|5.0|I am spending time filling in the gaps that I missed out on during the 60s and 70s. I grew up with the better known 'John Barleycorn..' and 'Low Spark..', but recently (thanks to the classic 1983 Rolling Stone Record Guide)acquired 'Mr Fantasy' and their 2nd album 'Traffic'. Both knock the spots off the later Traffic, and while the critics gave 'Mr Fantasy' only 4 stars I rate it one of the best albums ever. Two songs on this album, namely 'No name, no face, not number' and 'Mr Fantasy' must be amongst the best rock songs ever, ever written (to say nothing of Steve Winwood's ethereal singing!). Regarding the issue about the US versus UK versions, I was fortunate to but a recently re-mastered CD that has both on it! Get that one, then sit back like a happy cat and lick the cream...
B0001GMIOE|5.0|I agree with others who have written don't settle for cheaper substitutes!  I bought a non-Canon brand backup battery for my Canon 20D years ago and it was good as a backup.  But I just went on a 2 week vacation trip this year and as my Canon battery was getting low, I popped in my backup.  To my surprise, it was dead, even after recently getting charged!  Luckily, I was shooting outside and didn't need the flash, so the Canon battery held out once I put it back in. The backup battery doesn't seem to hold a charge now.  Don't try to save some money and then risk losing some good shots--buy Canon!  You'll be glad you did.

They also reminded me of a bunch of Freddy Krueger Wanna-Be's; without the acne problem.<br />SLEEEEEP!<br /><br />Kiefer Sutherland delivers his usual low-talking dialogue (just a tad louder than in \\"24\\"). Jennifer Connolly is an air-head nightclub singer (there is no day) and wife of \\"Murdoch.\\" Murdoch?

Willian Hurt is cast in his usual \\"heavy\\" part that he's been relegated to, the past decade or so.<br /><br />SHELL BEACH, SHELL BEACH, SHELL BEACH. Yeah......real fun movie (he says tongue-in-cheek). Then again, maybe my review is a fabrication and an illusion ;-)
1416562605|4.0|In contrast to the main character of The White Tiger, Aravind Adiga received an extensive education from some of the best institutions available-Columbia undergrad and then Oxford. In his book, however, Balram Halwai, the White Tiger or sweet maker, grows up with a very minimal education, scratching by barely with the ability to read in a system designed, it seems to keep one ignorant rather than to educate. In fact the whole system of castes in India, in modern day India, through the eyes of Balram, tends to rigidly, forcefully and cruelly keep one either in the category of servant and poverty or of the privileged and well-off. To a minimal extent Balram bucks the system and rises above his father and becomes a driver for a wealthy family. Even the wealthy,  however, must maintain their businesses and position through a corrupt system of bribes to politicians who stay in power through a democracy that disenfranchises certainly the poor and perhaps others as well.  The book is written well with energy and a steady string of either interesting or amusing anectdotes as Balram progresses from \\"the darkness\\" or poor, rural India to Delhi which appears as a city in a state of rapid but chaotic modernization where buildings are rising steadily for either malls or job centers for outsourced work from countries like the US. Again the inequities abound for Balram,the driver, and those like him, and the superior castes appear anything but. The book is fast-paced and entertaining.
B001GKJ2FC|5.0|This movie was over the top of the top action. Put in the disc and check your brain at the door and hold on tight.  Great blu-ray picture and sound.
B001ED7C58|5.0|My affair with the Twilight Saga began about a week ago, when I, never having read any of the books, heard from a friend that the music for the movie was excellent. Paramore, Muse, Linkin Park - some of my favourite bands - all on one exciting, dark, and beautiful CD. I listened to the samples and decided, intrigued, to see the movie. And the rest is history.<br /><br />While I agree with some reveiws that such modern, almost punk, rock is not what I would have expected of a love story between a 110+ year old vampire and a human girl in rainy Washington, but it, like the modern soundtrack of Marie Antoinette, works surprisingly well, giving a dramatic soundtrack to the movie that flows with the deep, gothic story far batter than a instrumental ensomble would have, emphisizing the deep duality between Bella and Edward's lives...
B000LXIZJE|5.0|this album is one i would want to be stuck on a desert album with. the songs are melodic and very easy to listen too.  best concept album ever, nights in white satin was a hit twice in 1967 & 1972. enjoy some good music
031606792X|5.0|Okay, I've read it three times, just to make sure.    When I finished Breaking Dawn, I loved it so much and was itching to write a review for it.  When I came on, and started to scroll through other people's reviews, I had to stop.  I have in the past, let my \\"fangirly\\" side take over my logical side when it comes to certain things.  And after reading some reviews, I started to think that maybe I did it again. So I decided to not review, and read the saga all over with a more critical mind.    It did not work.  Once again, I got so engrossed in the saga that I completely forgot to keep in mind some things that 1 star reviewers were referring to. So I tried a third time.  This time, instead of reading the entire saga over, I just read Breaking Dawn (because that was the real problem).  I read it at a much slower pace.    It worked.  I saw a lot of the flaws 1 star reviewers were pointing out.  I definitely can see why this installment in the saga annoyed people, if not, down right pissed them off...    But although I saw it and understood it, it still didn't change my feelings of the book as a whole.  With the really bad, came so much more good.  Yes, that could just be the fangirl in me, but hey, remember, she had a blast the first AND second time anyway.  She ain't going anywhere.    *****************SPOILER ALERT*******************    Wedding: I saw no real problem with the wedding itself, but the book could have done without the first few chapters.  Thing is- I admit I actually like those first few chapters.  The kissing, the banter, Bella's ridiculous inner \\"mature\\" fight with herself.  I ate it all up.    Honeymoon:  What the heck DID happen to our sex scene?!  I mean, I'm not a voyeur or anything, but seriously, I felt like I was having sexual frustrations with Bella in the first three books. (LOL)  Thing is- I was able to get over it quick, because I knew what kind of audience this saga has (whatever).  But really, I kind of forgot about it because I thoughtit was hilarious how addicted to sex Bella had become.  So funny.    Book Two:  Honestly, I didn't like that from the beginning, because I didn't want to be in someone else's mind.  I was too used to Bella's.  Thing is- It was nice to get know the pack a little bit more.  And I actually really like the interaction between Jacob and Edward.  It was a cool change to have Edward read the narrator's mind.    Imprinting on Nessie: (First, way too much reference of it being a boy, just to have it actually be a girl in the end, just to get that out of the way).  What an easy way out for Bella and Jacob.(LOL)  Thing is- I do like Jacob.  I like the image of him sticking around with the Cullens, and it only seems that wouldn't happen if Nessie was not around.    Bella as a vampire: Another easy way out.  Because she was aware she was becoming a vampire, she wasn't a monster like we thought she might be?  Too easy.  Thing is- aww well, lol.  It would have been kind of boring while she went nuts for a couple years.  I just like her new vampire instincts.  The scenes between her and Edward(^_^) and her and Emmett were a lot of fun to read.    J.Jenks- there was no real point in seeing him and all that, was there? Big waste.  Thing is- cool to see how other people reacted to Bella.  Not that big a deal, but still interesting.    The entire Volturi encounter: Where was the fight?  I do have a very hard time believing that the Volturi felt that defeated because of Bella.  Yes I'm sure they \\"hesitated\\" like Edward said but I'm also sure they heard of the phrase \\"element of surprise.\\"  Thing is- I still liked the whole encounter itself.  The Volturi's reaction to some the things they were discovering little by little, Kate and Garret (cute), and Alice coming to save the day.    **********End of Spoiler Alert!**************    I know there were many other things that other reviewers referred to be as annoying, but I probably just didn't consider them to be all that big a deal.    Basically, although I now understand everyone's point of view,  It obviously doesn't change mine.  I know that was not most reviewers intentions, but I'm the type of person that likes to walk around in everyone else's side of the fence.  I still have major respect for everyone's opinions and am VERY glad that they shared them. (totally kissing booty right now, so no one will be mad with me, LOL, but its true)    So I'm not going to say \\"I totally LOVED Breaking Dawn, and you all should go out NOW and buy it\\" like I was going to do after my first read.  I will tell you...that if you do decide it pick up this book, keep an open mind and be prepared for ANYTHING.

0307269752|5.0|I read many, many nonfiction books as part of my own work, so it often doesn't feel very relaxing to pick up a novel in my free time.  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo broke through my burnout and really helped reconnect with my love of fiction.  It is the first book in a long time that completely pulled me in with its characters, setting and mystery.<br /><br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is highly intelligent, and earns its volatile climax.  The novel progressed to a level of violence that surprised me, but again, it made sense within the context of the story, which is as much social critique as it is Agatha-Christie-like murder mystery--as updated for the era of The Silence of the Lambs.  For me it brings to mind Kate Atkinson's [[ASIN:0316033480 Case Histories: A Novel]], amped up a notch. (I enjoyed The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo even more.)<br /><br />Disgraced journalist turned reluctant detective Mikael Blomkvist and brilliant, damaged researcher Lisbeth Salander are worthy characters whom I'll definitely follow through two sequels.  Larsson hints at his characters' depths (of their life stories and pain) and their shallowness (in some quarters, when it comes to human relationships).  For instance, when you find out why Lisbeth gets a tattoo, it will make you re-evaluate all that you know, or don't know, about her life history.  In fact, after reading this book and finding out what goes on behind closed doors, and beneath respectable facades, you may wonder how well you really know anyone.<br /><br />The cold-case mystery of the missing girl from the Vanger family completely engrossed me.  My one criticism of the book is that the subplot about \\"The Wennerstrom Affair,\\" which indirectly sets the main story in motion, and comes back at the end of the book, didn't really work for me.  It seemed like it would ultimately have much more of a connection to the Vanger story.  Was Wennerstrom just a distraction, or an element of social satire that didn't translate well, or is there more there than meets the eye on first read?  The actual \\"payoff\\" of the Wennerstrom subplot was the one aspect of the story I found unsatisfying.  I wonder if those events and characters will come back in Larsson's subsequent books to finally create a logical, full-circle moment.<br /><br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo takes a while to get going.  It took an effort to get to know the main characters and sort out the plot, and I wasn't fully invested until page 83, after the Vanger mystery was laid out.  But once Mikael and Lisbeth really got going on the case, it became one of those books that kept me up until one in the morning on a roller coaster ride, trying futilely to find a place to pull over, because I knew I still had 100 pages to go and I didn't want to pull a true all-nighter.<br /><br />Highly recommended for those hungry for a smart, complex and grown-up thriller.more there than meets the eye on first read?

031606792X|5.0|I purchased the entire Twilight Saga (Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse, Breaking Dawn).  The book series was aimed at the yound adult audience, but as a \\"older\\" adult reader I can say that I was truely captivated.  I purchased the entire saga series and read all four books in under 5 days even though I work full time.  And I will definately read the series again.    I am going to skip specifics, as to not spoil the books for anyone.    What did I pull from reading this series? forbidden love, wanting something you can't have or that may not be good for you, facing fears, dealing with divorce, dealing with moving to a new place/school, making friends, sacrifice, selflessness, waiting to share yourself with someone else until you are married, Losing that one person that makes your life worth living, the feeling of Love from every possible angle (mother, father, family, friends, lover, yourself), self confidence, somethings are worth fighting for, somethings are better left alone and so many more topics.    Twilight - Book 1  It is the beginning of a wonderful forbidden love, the author successfully pulls you into the book allowing to easily feel the emotions of the characters.  Not as well put together as next books in the series, but still, as I said before, captivating.  *After reading this book I would suggest downloading the authors partial manuscript of Edwards version from the authors website;  It really brings you into the story further... I read it after book3, but wished that I had read it after book 1.  Do not read it before book 1 though, It may ruin some of the suspense of book 1.    New Moon - Book 2  Again the author brings you into the book feeling the charaters strong emotions.  You get a little upset with some of the characters from the first book.  You can feel what they are going through and it sets the stage for the next three books.      Eclipse - Book 3  Books 1 & 2 are pulled back together with the same intensity and some of the things previously brought out are now in perspective.       Breaking Dawn - Book 4  Although there was some switching perspective in the previous book, this book has quite a bit more of that switching going on. With that said, I think that the switching was neccessary to get the full story out in the open.  The author pulls evertything from all of the prior books into one nice package in the end, yet still leaves a little bit of an opening for future books or stories to shoot off from.  The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the \\"sci-fi\\" feeling in the middle of the book, but all in all I was pleased.    Note: You may not appreciate the time the author put into the character building  and placement until after you have read all four books.  Her unique style is wonderful to read and I feel it was this attention that made the books so good.    I do wish that this book was written to the adult audience so that the scenes didn't have to be so \\"PG\\" rated.  It would have made it a little more interesting in some parts.  However, she left enough details to let your imagination fill in the gaps.
1420931571|4.0|I've probably read The Beautiful and Damned ten or more times--it is a very compelling story, although it also contains many annoying flaws. It, as others have stated, is somewhat verbose and seems as though it was not edited as heavily with Maxwell Perkins (as Gatsby later was.) The third person omniscient narrator is somewhat preachy--and obstructs much of the action, but there are passages of absolute brilliant, clear description of self-destruction and living in the moment. The narrative is almost bone-crushingly linear, as Gloria and Anthony fling themselves toward their inevitable, terrible fate. They \\"achieve\\" their notion of the American dream, in the end, but at a terrible cost to them both...    The topic and the structure of this book is echoed amazingly in Hubert Selby Jr.'s Requiem for a Dream. The characters in that book also lose sight of the reality of their lives in their desperate pursuit of their \\"dreams.\\" It would be interesting to know if Selby might have been inspired by this Fitzgerald novel. It certainly reads as if he did.
0375826726|3.0|I enjoyed the books as a whole and have not been as critical of them as other people.    My main criticism of this book is that it leads you to think the series is going to end and then you get to the end and what, a fourth book? It seems to me that it would have been better to end here.    I also found writing a bit odd at the end. I think the concept of the \\"heart of hearts\\" is an interesting one to explain Galbotorix's power. However, couldn't he have come up with a better phrase or word? Heart of hearts is ...lame, really.
