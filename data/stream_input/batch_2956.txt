B000I9U9A4|5.0|I love history dressed up with a little fiction- or is it the other way around?  I hate to admit that I have trouble gettoing into O'Brians novels but that's probably because I didn't read the very first one.<br /><br />This movie, on the other hand, is completely engrossing. The story line holds together well and the details are amazing- even better on Bluray. (I eventually bought the Bluray version.)  Even if you are burned out on pirate movies you will probably still enjoy &#34;Master and Commander&#34;.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|Fun and mildly addictive. You do run out of lives fairly quickly and it is annoying to constantly be asked to spend money for more.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|A 100 year old man exits the window of his retirement home to avoid a planned birthday party. Lacking a plan other than escape, he pads to the bus station in his house slippers beginning an adventure of a lifetime. This novel tells the story of that adventure, punctuating it with flashbacks covering his entire first 100 years and serving to explain how the man remains calm and undismayed by this current ever-darkening situation. The path of that life wandered through the major historical events of his time and into the lives of the most notable actors in that history; much like Forest Gump although the100 year old man's intellect is clearly a superior one. The tale charmed and interested me despite improbable circumstances and events. If you can suspend your disbelief for a bit I expect it will do the same for you.
B000I8ERVC|3.0|I recently watched the flick again after not seeing it for many years. I did see when it first came out. It was the movie to see if you were of a certain age. But I didn't like it much then, and I feel about the same now. However, I did like the scenes of the American southwest as it is my favorite place to vacation. But the central theme of the movie: freedom? Uh, no thanks. Living that kind of life is just as deadening as any traditional way of life you can think of. Constantly getting high and saying \\"groovy man\\" ? Sorry. And the two main characters, Wyatt and Billy, are actually criminal drug-smugglers. But of course to the geniuses at Rolling Stone and other leftist, counter-culture outlets, they were \\"heroes\\" who were thumbing their noses at  America and the man. The South really takes it on the chin with the climax of the movie and all the scenes in-between. Jack Nicholson's career was kick-started (ha, ha) by this flick, but his oft-quoted line about people hating Wyatt and Billy because they represented freedom is a crock. Most adults looked at hippies as drug-addled lunatics who were wasting their lives. Which they were. Another myth left over from the sixties is that most kids were hippies like the dolts in the commune. The fact is only a tiny percentage of kids (less than 5%) were hippies. So as an entertaining medium Easy Rider barely satisfies. It's interesting to me for reasons other than being a realistic movie. Which it isn't.  But as far as being a great flick...no way MAAAAAAAAN!!!
B0061TQBRK|5.0|I discovered this band listening to Pandora, and decided to pick up a couple of albums.  What a find!  &#34;Kill the Light&#34; is my favorite track, but there isn't a weak song on this album.
B001RCUL5Y|5.0|My son absolutely loves this movie. His favorite scene is when Bugsy is introduced and Adam Sandler's charcacter says &#34;let me see them&#34; (about the eyes) and exclaims &#34;doh!!!  Those eyes would look small on a cow... are those eye balls or bowliing balls.&#34; He laughs incessantly at that every time and repeats the line well into the next scene. The movie is fantastical, fun and funny. While a complete departure for Adam Sandler from his norm, he carries the movie well and children respond to his character in every one of his incarnations in the film. The two child stars are cute and brilliant in their portrayals. They truly seemed to enjoy Adam in this film and it shows in their performance.<br /><br />A warning to parents though; if you are not a story teller you may not want to show this movie to you children as they will want you to tell them bedtime stories so they can imagine making up stories like the ones in the film. My son, although we have read stories for bedtime since he was a baby, now once in a while will ask me to make up a story for him, which we happily do together. Story time has taken up a whole new meaning in our lives as a result and we spend many nights laughing and having fun at bedtime.<br /><br />I recommend this movie highly if you just want a fun experience to share with your child.
B00DCRE7M0|5.0|James LaBrie's latest solo effort is his best yet.  Strong songwriting.  Every track a winner.  I highly recommend this album.
B00BMYHU7Y|5.0|I cannot believe how quickly I received my item! It was estimated to be here in at least 14 days. I received it in two! THANKS!!
B00CCEHYO2|5.0|I saw these guys on the 2009 &#34;Progressive Nation&#34; tour in Minneapolis.  Plus I got to meet them and they all autographed a CD.  They put on a great performance that night.  This album is in the same spirit as their first.  Solid all the way around.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|Tried to copy our tapes to the computer and didn't work!  I another one I purchased last year and recorded 10 tapes onto the computer.  It wouldn't work this summer!!  So sad!  Maybe just a different company!!
B000P12LWY|3.0|I really think there was more to this generation than sex.  And  the sex was badly done, they worked to hard to achieve an orgasm and I don't understand why. I liked the history of it, although somewhat flawed, the era and the costumed were very nice.
B001BRJZPW|5.0|Great series! Plenty of action and special effects. Soundtrack is incredible on a home theatre system! I highly recommend this series.
B0059XTUVI|2.0|I thought thsi would delve more into the things she did as Prime Minster so I was unhappy that it focused more on her health. I will not watch it again.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|This album rocks all the way through!! There is not a song on the album that I don't like! BUY IT
B00DJZR46G|3.0|I was looking forward to this new Elton John CD, but I am pretty disappointed.  The idea of an entire mid-tempo album with just EJ and his piano was a great idea, but the songs really lack anything that brings them to life or makes them catch your attention.  They seem more like poetry set to music and have nothing to distinguish them.  The only exception is Home Again, which is one of the best things Elton John has ever done.  I would say this one is for die hard fans only.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Deftly written, this sequel to &#34;The Shining&#34; delivered.  It delivered via FedEx in a big red box all wrapped up with a huge bow on top.  With streamers.  And balloons.  And a parade.  And a marching band.<br /><br />I was nervous about this book.  How was Uncle Steve going to pick up the story?<br /><br />He did it at 100 MPH with a forklift, that's how.  He was then off to the races.<br /><br />The story flew for me, especially since I had downloaded and re-read &#34;The Shining&#34; the day before.<br /><br />No spoilers here, just a suggestion: stop what you're doing and go get this book.  Now.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|No stars. Got it, Leaked. Sent back to lifeproof.  Was FAKE. Veryyy upset. Packaged in legit packaging. But wasnt real. Very dissatisfied!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We liked watching this series and can't wait for the next season. Right from the start the story line is addictive and the characters are believable and seem to work well together.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I couldn't put it down, love Liane's writing. Very engaging and a great story. I would highly recommend to anyone
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|so many hidden agendas!  An unhappy x-husband, affairs, and competition make for an interesting look at the back end of the road to Broadway!  Fun show!
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|Not worth anyone's time.  Didn't want to give it any stars, but had to give 1.  Don't waste your time.  What could have been entertaining was just garbage.  Dredd spent the whole time trying to scowl like Stallone.  Must have had a bad smelling helmet.  This version make the Stallone/Rob Schneider version seem like a 4 star.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I downloaded this APP to my Kindle Fire HD - I love the slot games & will be downloading more.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I love this series so much I have rewatched it three times and ordered all the books. The lives and times of these folks fascinate me. Everyone should watch it at least once.
B00D9TMVJW|5.0|...they make you read and analyze this book in French class in the 7th or 8th grade, along with Candid and other annoyingly difficult books.  I absolutely hated this book back then, but got to appreciate it when reading it years later.  When is the US going to catch up to European or Asian education standards?  I remember soldering circuit boards and programming them with Turbo Pascal back in the 7th/8th grade in France...
B006QV30JU|4.0|I love musicals.  They seem to be making a comeback, as even regular plays are being re-introduced as musicals.  This is wonderful.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I thought this was the perfect ending to the trilogy. I look forward to reading the three again some day.
B00B7364H2|5.0|I had preordered the first box set, but was on the fence with this second volume, mainly because of the selection of the re-issues. But, when the price suddenly dropped to $85.00 with Prime Delivery last week, (it was mysteriously, only for one day...9/23/13) I jumped on it, and have been enjoying the wealth of artistry and excellence ever since. Even some of the marches! I really think some of these 55 year old recordings, blow away most current SACDs. The sound quality is that stupendous. I used to collect these albums as a kid, and it's a joy to have them again in my collection! Thank you Wilma! And thank you Amazon, for your somewhat unorthodox price fluctuations!

B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Fun game to play!! Would like to play with more energy but waiting keeps me from playing it out and growing bored too. Great game for kids as they get bored easily and by the time they run out of energy they're ready to switch anyway!!!
B004I744AS|5.0|The dictionary offers variety on many levels. I view it as a learning tool for anyone. It is user friendly.  It exposes the user to historical and exciting information. Games provide good stimulation and alertness for the brain.
B005LAIISA|5.0|My kids love the Ice Age movies.  Personally, I think they get progressively funnier.  Since this is the fourth one in the series, I thought it was funnier than the previous ones, and well-done.  It is hard to find a movie that all of my kids enjoy, with our age range, but this does the trick.
B0002KZAKS|4.0|I bought this mic for my daughter and it works well.  The only complaint that I have is that it does not have an on/off switch.
B004Y1WCDE|4.0|Not as stable or solid as Air Video for iOS, but the best you will get on any Android device. Video streaming services make storing digital video every day less of a thing, but there are always one or two movies you may own that can’t be found anywhere else. It’s nice to keep those at the tip of your digital fingers in your computer so you can play them back from any android device you own.
B00D6QU6RW|4.0|The Backstreet Boys will always be the best Boy Band ever.<br />Despite still sounding great, I felt that the classic old-school harmonizing that became the trademark of these men, was not as well utilized in this album as previous ones.<br />Still regularly going to listen to it!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Has a good story line for those who like adventure with both easy n challenging games. A game with a lot of mystery but yet still fun to play...would buy from them again.
B00F3YJ0LS|3.0|Disappointing  and lacking passion but well rehearsed and coordinated to the extent that the separate voices were excessively blended and therefore less interesting.
0345541588|4.0|For fans of Jack Reacher, as I am, this might seem not up to pare with all the other books that Lee Childs has written. It was a little slow in spots and at times, it was hard to follow the story but in the end, it made me want to finish it and drew me in.
B00ARW2XJW|3.0|It's a thermometer.  It works well.  Measures your tablet/phone's temperature and the surrounding area.  Haven't had a chance to compare it to a real one for accuracy.
B00F91H666|4.0|excellent movie , keeps  you  on  the  edge  of  your  seat  from  start to  finish.  You  won't want  want it to  end.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|I knew that Thomas would escape, but this? This is crazy. WICKED needs brains! They must be zombies. But overall, I loved this book.
B00ENV1HPY|4.0|I am not only surprised by how much I love this album, but also how well it fits into the continuum of Mazzy Star's sound. This is not a \\"play it again\\" album in the least: it is original and fresh sounding. At the same time, it's definitely more in the realm of \\"Among My Swan\\" in terms of the sound. The imagery it evokes is one of sitting in the shade in the late afternoon somewhere in the Southwest and listening to David pluck out some gritty acoustic-blues notes while Hope sings along. Not a bad thing by any stretch. If you are unfamiliar with Mazzy, this album is a bit like a sweeter sounding, acoustic-blues version of The Kills.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Vince Gill is an extraordinary talent and Paul Franklin is excellent musician as well. If you like country you will love this cd.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I think this is the best game ever I could play this all day it can be so addictive I think it's fun to see virtual ponies in games and the 3d expressions . The characters make and they all just have fun with it I really love this game  and any one who just look at the tittle can tell this can be fun and exciting game that bring joy excitement to a every day person  . It is so . Common to find a game that doesn't express it true value I truly just put down word I just think it's a great game&hellip;% 
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I thought the book was over halfway through,  but it continues to get really good. And the Epilogue is fantastic. I highly recommend this book.
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|Not my favorite of the three, but still excellent, I can't put it down! That's saying something for a tired mommy of a newborn!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Another great book by Ken Follett.  I loved reading about history and following a great love story.  Lets you really see the life people had to live in those days.
B001O3UJ8K|5.0|This record is worth the price if only for &#34;Wish&#34; and &#34;Last&#34;. The most guitar driven, distorted and hardest record so far from NIN. The songs are fast and very convoluted with layers of noise, samples and guitars. More pig lyrics here.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game keeps my grandson busy for hours.,  He just loves it and I am amazed how it has helped his eye-hand coordination develop.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|I mean, the books are always better, and this movie is about the slow part of the last book, so you won't see much action. But ypu definitely need to watch this to understand the part 2.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This is a great app. for my Android. It is simple to use and as far as flashlights go, it is brighter than most.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I love HP books, and most of the times, these movies disappoint me. However, I watched this one with the lowest possible hope or expectation, and it actually surprised me. I recommend everyone to watch it, but just if you have seen the previous ones.
B00ECUARO8|1.0|Be sure to have the time to watch a video before renting.  I could not find any provision to extend an unwatched video & regretfully had to forfeit \\"money for nothing\\".
B008D28HYS|5.0|Addictive puzzles. I wouldn't want to just use fingers to click on those itty boxes,  but with an S-pen, it's just perfect.
B00F35BV64|1.0|Downloaded amazon video app on iPad but not able to view on tv thru mirroring from iPad.  Very unhappy with amazon.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|Does what it advertised.. simple.  Easy.great service nice to use file finder.<br />. Can't say enough but need two more words to post. LOL
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Got to the end and was so sad! The way the author wrapped things up for very cool...very different. I actually just sat outside to read and remembered that I was finished...sigh.
B00F5FBE82|4.0|Definitely not what I was expecting, but I like it. Worth the money. I like his last album better though.. I have a feeling this album will grow on me though.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This show was fantastic.  The acting was top-notch, the writing superb, and the direction amazing. I highly recommend this to detective show fans, to David Tennant fans, and to fans of just plain good television.  (I admit I occasionally had to put on the closed captioning because of the thick accents, but I'm cool with that.)
B0031RS44S|5.0|Never thought Jack Reacher was going to get out of this one. I lie of course, I knew he would get through and win. lee Child gets my vote every time
B007BO4DQU|5.0|This item came just as described without any scratches or problems. Would buy from this person again. You get what they describe.
B008HTQ28K|3.0|Something is missing from John Grishams latest novels. He was one of the best when he began writing, but that excitement and breakneck plot and tension is lacking in this one
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Love it having the time of my life. It's funny crazy and so unpredictable.I love it my family love it.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|The movie was action packed. The zombies looked awesome. It was so great that I wanted it to be longer.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Great cinematography and stylistically very cool. I really don't find the story that compelling. I thought the book was kind of boring and the movie was too. I thought the movie did a good job being true to the book and even kept many of the metaphors intact. (Yes, I know this kind of opinion is heresy in certain literary circles because the book is considered in the running for the Great American novel.) It just doesn't do it for me.
0064431789|5.0|Love it and it arrived very quickly.  Did'nt have any problems what so ever. I would for sure recommend to anyone.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Very practical & innovative electronic & chemical applications. Very good reading for information & relaxation. Try it. You will see what I mean.
0553573411|5.0|Robin Hobb is now my favorite fantasy author (Okay, I still love Robert Jordan and Patrick Rothfuss and Lois McMaster Bujold, etc.), but this book had me literally sobbing at the end. As I put the book down, I was like, holy s*#t, are you f#&$#g kidding me?!?? How can a book leave me shaking with wracking sobs? I discovered Robin Hobb first with Liveship Traders trilogy, which I totally loved. Assassin's Apprentice also was really good.<br /><br />Normally, I listen to audiobooks during a long commute. I know when a writer has me hooked when I buy the Kindle or paper edition so that I can read it in between rides in the car. I mean seriously I couldn't wait to go to work just to listen to her stuff (that is abnormal) and then I would sit in the driveway to finish the chapter (some of which are really long, which I love of course, being an epic fantasy fan).<br /><br />Anyway, Hobb is a master at dragging her characters through the depths of human emotion, and taking her readers along with them. I was totally inside the character's skin. This series is in first person from only one POV, aside from the beginning of each chapter which employs various forms of the omniscient: storytelling, myths, letters, reminiscing from the future, etc.<br /><br />Okay, so she does set up some purely despicable villains, with pretty much no redeeming qualities, but her heroes are more multi-dimensional. Sometimes the heroes are a little infuriating in their choices, but it makes for good tension. Also, the hero of this story has the excuse of being an adolescent. In any case, I find her writing thoroughly immersive and enjoyable, and that's what it's all about for me. I can't wait to read the third book of the trilogy, then the Tawny Man trilogy.<br /><br />Loved it. Nuff said.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I read The Shining in 1978 when I was 13.  It was the first grown up book I ever read. When I got to page 217 and Jack was about to enter room 217 I slammed the book shut and stuffed it into the back of our freezer.  I was scared sh*tless.  It took my mom two months to convince me to thaw it and finish.  Thirty five years later and countless SK books later I loved finding out what happened to Danny.  It is a perfect ending to a terrifying story.  Abra is a kick ass Shiner.  Thank you Stephen King for giving me the gift of loving reading.  You ROCK!!

078322737X|4.0|Somehow, despite a bit of tediousness to George Lucas' 1973 classic slice-of-life film about a night in 1962, which finds a group of teenagers on the brink of adulthood, who, while they occasionally congregate at one Mel's drive-in, and at a school sock-hop, spend most of their final weekend night of freedom cruising the streets of Modesto, California to the sound of an array of popular songs of that era, which generate this story. The first we hear will be Bill Hayley's \\"Rock Around the Clock\\"; the last, The Beach Boys' \\"We'll Be Having Fun All Summer Long\\"(which was actually released two years after this story takes place).The adventures that take place in between showcase the talent of many young stars who would come to eminence later in the decade, and in fact influence many of their vehicles that launched them to stardom.<br />  A year before starring in his second-long-running series, we see former child-star Ron Howard as Steve Bolander, who has spent all summer encouraging his friend, Curt Henderson(Richard Dreyfuss), to go to college in the East and see more of the world, but now stands undecided about whether or not he wants to do the same. Bolander has been dating Curt's sister, Laurie(A pre-\\"Laverne and Shirley\\" era Cindy Williams)and has to make a decision about their relationship. He ends up loaning his nerdy friend, Terry \\"The Toad\\" Fields  his 1958 Impala, in which Terry will pick up a free-spirited young blonde named Debbie Dunham(Candy Clark), that he sees on the streets, and they share a night of confrontation with a guy Debby previously dated, the theft of the car, a brawl, and Terry's getting sick, all of which somehow impresses his date.<br />  Their friend John Milner( Paul Le Mat), who has the reputation of being the smoothest cruiser in the state, drives around in a yellow Deuce, which earns the insults of fellow cruiser, Bob Alfalfa( Harrison Ford--note he has the surname of a car)who is initially with his  girl, played by Debralee Scott. But these kids change cars in the middle of the street as frequently as a person can change socks, and while John was trying to impress one girl in a group of girls in one car, he soon finds his shotgun seat occupied by the girl's sister, an adventurous teenybopper named Carol Morrison( MacKenzie Phillips), all of 14 years old. A good bit of his time will be spent figuring out how to get Carol to go home and at one point, he has to explain to a cop what she is doing in his car. Milner explains to the cop, and also to others on the road that she is  his young cousin.<br /> As these vignettes take place, the central figure tying them together is the XERB disc jockey Wolfman Jack(Himself), firmly in command of his post.<br /> Carol tells John that her mother won't let her listen to the Wolfman due purportedly to his race, reflecting the prejudices of the time.During their drive, John has to reassure the insecure girl that her family don't resent her. But at some point, the two have fun spraying shaving cream on the windows of cars on the road in response to a water balloon being thrown at Carol.<br />  Curt's impetus for wanting to meet the Wolfman is to dedicate a song to a mysterious Blonde(Suzanne Somers) he saw in a white 1956 Thunderbird who had mouthed \\"I love you\\" to him while riding with Steve and Laurie.He receives<br />no help in tracking her down, and later receives  word from other girls who enter the car that she is either a prostitute or a trophy wife.<br /> But in  the meantime, he somehow leaves that car and finds himself in the company of the local gang, known as the Pharaohs, led by Joe Young(Bo Hopkins), and pulls a prank on the cops with them.<br /> Steve and Laurie have a spat and part company. When Laurie sees Steve chatting with a waitress at Mel's, she mistakenly believes he is being unfaithful, and enters Bob Alfalfa's car with near-fatal consequences.<br />  Curt eventually arrives at the radio  station to dedicate  a song to the mysterious blonde, and chats with the disc jockey, who he eventually recognizes as the Wolfman. He is advised to go ahead with his plans to attend school in the East, as the D.J. regrets not being able to see more of the world, and points out that as he is not as young as he used to be and would take the same opportunity to travel, if he were a young man presently.<br />  At dawn, Curt does get to chat briefly with the pretty blonde while he is in a pay phone booth, but must be content with the fact that that is all the time he will have with her.<br />  As a plane carries Curt to a new life, George Lucas gives the film what was an innovative twist for its time by revealing the fates of the main characters at the end.<br />  This 90-minute-flick about teens riding around in the dark has become a classic, and in honor of the 40th anniversary of its release, I pay all due homage to a cinematic piece which, although it takes place mostly in darkness, will continue to ride on and shine on for for many years to come!
1451668945|1.0|I own almost all of Mary Higgins Clarks books.  This was a terrible disappointment.  I won't buy another one and wish I could get my money back.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it is what i need at that time.  Good, simple and very usefull product.  And more important that it is free.
B004AM5QT4|5.0|Another great Follett read. Great storyline, great characters and the pages turn themselves. I wish Follett turned out books as fast as Patterson.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|This book was fun to read, but it also challenged traditional ways of seeing the world and offered a sympathetic insight into the world of a very unique individual.
B004XVN1T4|4.0|I always like reading Follett although this story dragged a little. What is lacking in the story is made up by great characters. Have a good read.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|Addictive and endlessly fun. Lag can kill the game, sometimes making escapes impossible. Female character design is a relentless nightmare, repeating the same old mistakes instead of learning from them.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|This is Follett's first best seller and it will not disappoint. Twists, turns, vivid scenes and great characters. He makes you feel that you are not only &#34;right there&#34;, but are &#34;experiencing&#34; the action.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I loved the book but gave it a four star because for me some of the actual battle description went on too much.  Other than that I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading the third.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I thought Grisham was in a slump after reading his last few books, but The Racketeer puts him back in the majors.  I hope he keeps up the good work. I love his writing style.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Great concept, sound and the difference  between the original birds story line. It also give the that addicted feel to it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really like this game BUT...<br /><br />I wish the pictures (of the rooms) would be larger, there would be a help button and that it was clearly defined and easy to find, also that the buttons on the right side of both on the map and in the rooms were easier to see. Other than that I think the game is great and I really enjoy it.
B00F35BV64|1.0|This was such a disappointment on many levels. first,i will say that in the reboot movie captain kirk had seemingly grown.in this movie he is portrayed as a punkish rebel to start the movie instead of the original idea that captain kirk was a brash, bold, innovative leader who thought outside the box. He was the counter balance to the bureaucratic mindset of starfleet, not some punk commander. The second problem i have is that so many components of the movie were ripped from the wrath of khan. but unlike khan, there is no history between kirk and khan, which really dilutes the psychological edge of the movie. third,the budget and goal of the movie. when i saw the budget of the movie i knew it was gonna be problematic. jj abrahms sold the franchise(as well as paramount) for pop culture suckiness instead of sticking to the intent of the franchise. while i can understand some changes with the roboot,some of the differences are inforgivable. like the design of the enterprise.in the original series the enterprise was designed like a tank or battleship and in the reboot its designed like a ferrari or yatch. its little details like that that ruin both the reboot and the second movie.and in this movie there are lots of little details like that that ruin the star trek experience and turn it into pop culture crapiness.

B0075MFS9Y|4.0|Took awhile for me to fully appreciate this cd. I thought it sounded alright at first but played it again and again...it grew on me each time. They have a nice folksy sound and lets hope they stick around for awhile.
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|I never watched the original or later versions of Star Trek on TV. The DVD is a feast for the eyes. if you like special effects, this is very impressive. Being a logical person, Spock is my favorite character.

B0089LOG02|5.0|Very interesting and good to read. I liked the way the two different stories came together. I definitely recommend it.
B006C3Q6GG|5.0|Patrick O'Brian really knows how to write full vibrant charicters and this story of tall ships and ocean adventure paints a vivid picture of life in the Royal Navy during the Nepolionic Wars. If you get it though, know that he uses a mix of nautical, english and archaic terms that can boggle you a bit. That being said their are resources like the online &#34;Patrick O'brian Guide for the Perplexed&#34;, the book &#34;Patrick O'Brians Navy&#34; and my Kindle; wich has alot of these definitions already included.

B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Very original plot. Great actors. Cool action scenes. Not quite Star Trek or Star wars good but, pretty dang close!
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a long long time. A really amazing life story of a 91 year old orphan and a bonding of a lost foster child.  Well worth the read!
B0039OC64M|5.0|Unlike most movies of today that rely on a heavy infusion of special effects, this movie follows the intent of the author - portraying a possible future where the power of the many is relinquished.
1476727651|5.0|I last read \\"The Shining\\" when I was in elementary school (yes, I know that was very young, but I read EVERYTHING I could get my hands on and my mom read Stephen King).  I decided to read \\"The Shining\\" again when \\"Doctor Sleep\\" arrived on my doorstep from amazon on Tuesday because I realized I'd not be bringing my full game to the table. I'm mentioning this merely because it puts me in a good place to comment on the flow from one novel to the other, having read both in a few days...<br /><br />Sequels are sometimes difficult to get right. They falter in the places where they should shine... Not so with this book... It's quite simply brilliant.  It IS a different book from \\"The Shining.\\"  It will not scare you in the same way but in some undefinable way, \\"Doctor Sleep\\" will scare you in a deeper more lasting manner.The Shining\\" scared me in a don't-go-to-the-bathroom-to-pee-in-the-dark-there-could-dead-bad-things way, but that sharp fear will fade after a week.... \\"Doctor Sleep\\" scared me in a thoughtful carry-around-think-what-if-this-could-happen way that will make Winnebagos give me the creeps for the rest of my life.<br /><br />I had mistakenly thought that SK had changed and that his novels are filled with more kindness than they used to be... more humanity... I read his early novels as a young child and have assiduously avoided reading them again as an adult... Meanwhile, I read \\"The Stand\\" every single time the world seems about to come apart at the seams... My discovery, upon reading \\"The Shining\\" yesterday, is that the humanity has always been pouring from SK's typewriter, I simply was most affected by the scares as a child... I now have an overactive imagination for which I happily think SK is at least partly to blame:) The truth of alcoholism is naked and honest in \\"The Shining,\\" as is the true horror that love for a person who is in the manacles of some beast's grasp like alcoholism... The ghosties still scared the ____ out of me... But, as an adult, I also understood the creeping horror underneath that comes from choices that push people from good to bad and back again...I hope if anyone reads this review, they'll go grab a copy of \\"The Shining\\" and start reading. Revisit an old friend...little doc...<br /><br />As for \\" Doctor Sleep,\\" the scares are there... The humanity is there... SK's last few novels always have at least one place where they pull at my guts and make me cry... \\"Doctor Sleep\\" made me cry three times at the end, the last being the author's note which also made me laugh with sorrow tears still in my eyes...<br /><br />\\"Doctor Sleep\\" is SK at the top of his game. Thrills, chills, laughs, tears... it's a home run... Read it... See Danny grown up... meet Abra...<br />Think about meeting SK and saying, \\"What's Abra like as a grown woman?\\" Knowing he'll probably say, \\"You can see who she'll be in who she is...\\" True... but as a Constant Reader, you'll hope for a third book...<br /><br />I'll start the begging... PLEEEEASE.<br /><br />Buy it. Read it. Fear Winnebagos.<br /><br />*If anyone is cross that I didn't say what the book was about, well, don't you want to read it for yourself?so understood the creeping horror underneath that comes from choices that push people from good to bad and back again...I hope if anyone reads this review, they'll go grab a copy of \\"The Shining\\" and start reading.

B008NCSZQ8|4.0|If you love your comic book heroes of your youth, you will like this film.  The action scenes are filled with all the excitement of the real Avengers.
B00006879E|3.0|I had never heard of this group until I saw the movie &#34;Somethings Gotta Give&#34;. I purchased this CD because of the song &#34;Sunday Morning&#34;. Heard in the movie. However, this song was missing that little intro where Keanu Reeves and Frances MacDormand see each other at the market. So, it's a little different. There are, only, 2 songs on the CD that I like. Sunday Morning and This Love.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read Enders Game for the first time when I was twelve and loved this book! Now that a major motion picture of Enders Game is coming out I decided to read it again. I'm now thirty and it's just as good as I remember!
B00DYWKPAQ|4.0|I'm not a huge KoL fan, but I do like some of their older stuff. I hate \\"Sex on Fire.\\" This album, to me is more like their older days. I particularly like the songs Rock City, Don't Matter, Comeback Story, and On the Chin. The bonus tracks are good if a bit familiar. Over all, this was a good purchase.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show is highly addictive. I hope they will be producing the show for a long time, because I am hooked.
B0076DELIG|5.0|In keeping with the standards for books written by Michael Connelly this one is excellent. (as were the rest of his offerings).
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great app for all ages. You get to take care of one horse, or many horses! The only thing I don't like is all the ads. Great game overall.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|Packed well and fast free shipping.  This is what I was looking for, small and portable this DAC/Head Amp works great while I'm doing hemo dialysis used with Iphone  3 times a week.  Recommended.
B00APYKXFS|1.0|I used it for about a minute, then turned it off... It might keep a 12 year old entertained, so take this advice from a 30-something year old... This game is a throwback to the old school games, and there's a reason why we stopped playing them.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Intense, thought provoklng, no pat endings. Strong female lead.  highly recommended, worth the time. Way above average TV fare<br />See it..
0783114893|5.0|I did have this on VHS so thought to get this DVD because i have always<br />  liked this movie.I looked about it bluray but got this one .<br /><br />  The video on it was not the best at some places,but was very happy with it<br />in the long run.I have the remakes of this movie,but still think this 1 is the BEST.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|this book has slightly Less sex than the first book and more of a story line, so I liked it better than the first one, which made this grandma blush a lot!
B00CM96A60|4.0|Armin has so many great songs - the majority of my entire Trance collection is comprised of Armin's work, with a preference for female vocal trance. I especially love pretty much every song with Justine Suissa.<br /><br />But I find myself struggling to review this album...I feel it teeters on the edge of being over-produced, trying to appeal to a broader, more pop-oriented audience.<br /><br />For example, 'Alone' and 'Turn This Love Around' are two very good songs, but I'm not quite sure they're really what I would call trance. They sound more like trance songs that have been remixed for the club scene.<br /><br />'Beautiful Life' and 'Waiting for the Night', on the other hand, feel more like 'classic' female vocal trance, and are probably my two favorite songs on the album.<br /><br />The title track, 'Intense', is interesting in many different ways. Although completely different, the first thing that comes to my mind with this track is to compare it with the 'Hymne & Sail' medley mix - I think 'Intense' essentially tries to better accomplish the sort of dichotomy that is present in that mix.<br /><br />However, whereas I find 'Hymn & Sail' somewhat boring, 'Intense' is much more engaging, interesting, and emotionally captivating. Having said that, it does come very, very close to the edge of being over-produced and gimmicky. But for me, it works.<br /><br />Overall, a very good album, but I find myself missing the 'simpler' vocal trance classics like 'Simple Things', 'Burned with Desire' (including the many remixes), 'Shivers', 'Sound of Goodbye', 'What if', 'Hold On To Me', and others.
B009ME47H2|3.0|I would like to use it for recording and playback.  The quality is good but the playback is EXTREMELY low.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Such a great story interweaving the lives of the aristocrats and the people who serve them.  Lots of love, laughter and tears.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|Wouldn't work on my s4 kept crashing on startup. Uninstalled it yesterday. So I never even got to play it
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Ken Follett's recent historical epics (\\"Pillars of the Earth,\\" \\"World Without End\\") specialize in the upheaval of society.  With \\"Fall of Giants,\\" we leave the Middle Ages behind and jump forward to the early 20th century, as World War I is about to tear apart the established world order.<br /><br />As usual, Follett uses a big cast to paint his canvas, where historical creations rub shoulders with real historical figures.  He does so to keep the story grounded in the official history of the era rather than for a comical \\"Forrest Gump tips off the Watergate burglary\\" purpose, but it's fair to say that Follett's fictional creations dominate the story if not world events.<br /><br />The first chapters focus on the strict societal rules of the nearly-departed 19th century.  If you are well-born, life could not be better.  An English earl merely sat back and collected fees from coal mined on his property - a gentleman did not need to worry about money.  A Russian princess could have peasants hanged for having their livestock graze on her land (thereby stealing from her).  And a mining company would hardly think twice about short-changing the safety and financial security of their labor force knowing that they could always use the threat of unemployment (read, destitution) against the workers.<br /><br />And if you're a woman, God help you.<br /><br />This strict world is about to be turned upside down by the outbreak of the Great War, perhaps mankind's single most catastrophic exercise of stupidity.  Perhaps the best scenes in \\"Fall of Giants\\" come as characters use every means at their disposal to prevent the coming war, only to fail as national pride dictates how unelected monarchs make foreign policy.<br /><br />Soon the world is mired in war, a war nobody wants and where the generals don't know how to fight.  Technology has outstripped tactics, and the aristocrats haven't bothered to keep up.  The dottering fools are the giants who will fall, to be replaced by thosemotivated by a zeal for justice and a sense of tactics - feminists, Bolsheviks, Nazis, and even bootleggers.<br /><br />Follett's characters tend to be a bit one-dimensional, but he uses his characters to great effect here.  Just as with \\"Pillars\\" and \\"World,\\" he gives plenty of screen time to his female leads, and there will probably be a hero for every reader to identify with just as a villain worthy of particular hatred.<br /><br />This is a massive book where the sex scenes probably outnumber the battle scenes, but that's a good thing because Follett really doesn't write a terrific battle scene anyway.  It's a sprawling first act in a three-act play (the Century Trilogy).  If you have the time (it's over 1,000 pages), it's definitely worth the investment to see how far we've come in 100 years.
B009XY97VC|5.0|I love this album!  Though I love all the songs!  I would have to say that number 4 &#34;El Dorado&#34; is absolutely awesome!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so exciting that I cannot stop playing it when I start.  I will recommend this game to all ages.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|If I hadn't read the book I don't think I would have understood or enjoyed the film at all.  It strives to weave together multiple storylines across multiple locations and time periods but without the structure or depth of the book it becomes a jumbled mess.  It doesn't have the entertainment factor to stand that firmly on its own.  Although the acting performances were not fantastic, it has an all-star cast and it's really cool to see each actor play 4 or 5 parts, many of whom are unrecognizable with makeup and costumes, until you see the final credits.
B008D28HYS|4.0|Very original game play, It's like a cross word puzzle but with colors instead of letters. Addicting and fun to play, A real brain teaser as well. I'd recommend it.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|My 4 year old son loves this game and he keeps busy playing and the graphics are truly beautiful best game ever
B007PTJOV0|2.0|Pretty much exactly like the original Mario games but with a leprechaun instead of Mario. Sort of hurts the value when it's so heavily based off one game and really lacks the originality because of that. Also the controls are a little frustrating as well and will cause quite a few deaths because of it.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|At first, I didn't enjoy this show.  But after I watched like 2 episodes, I was hooked.  I'm happy to own it!  This set comes with separate cartridges for the 4 seasons. This set is not the knockoff version.  It's copyrighted by Paramount.
0920668364|5.0|this is still a favorite and my kids are in the late 20's.  I'm now buying this book for my grand child.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|The best Star Trek ever. Action packed and Spock even shows some humanity. The cast interacts well together. Two thumbs up.
0805092447|3.0|i love the stoary however I wanted a hardcover full-size book.  Was disappointed it fell in the small book category.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I found the writing to be very interesting -- with many characters I could still follow the story.  I liked the follow-up after the husband's secret was revealed.  Very enjoyable and fast read.
0694003611|3.0|the actual size of the books should be note on the description.  This is a short board book.  I wasn't expecting that.
B0036BK6MW|3.0|Let me say that I like the job Sandra Bullock did in this movie but I still would have given the Academy Awards to Meryl Streep for her performance as Julia Childs in &#34;Julie & Julia.&#34;  That said, I cannot recall Sandra giving a more commanding performance in her career. It's like she went to the Julia Roberts/Helen Hunt/Kate Winslet, etc., school of how to be a woman with sass an win an oscar.<br /><br />As for the story, it was rather boring, predictable and insulting to me. Here we go again with the rich white family helping the poor african american (see &#34;The Help&#34;). Apparantly, Michael Ohr, the real black kid depicted here, is writing a treatment about what really happened. That I would like to see.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|It is a wonderful read, I want the next book ASAP!!!!! The book was a page turner and I look forward to the next book in the series. WOO-HOO it rocks
B005K17RU0|5.0|Nice new app. I liked the old one but change is good. This one has lots information. Thanks alot kelp up the good work.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Enjoyed the suspense very much.  Crouch led me down many paths that didn't exist.  The surprise ending is a wonderful twist.
B003QS9WIE|5.0|Great twists and turns throughout. Kept me guessing through the entire movie. Nolan does not disappoint with this amazing thriller.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|The real magic of this movie is that you really don't know the secrets until they are revealed to you.  Enjoy!
0763660531|5.0|I highly recommend this book for young and Old.  There are no words so you create your own story and every time you look at it you see something new.  This books allows your imagination to run wild!
B000I3SYEI|5.0|one of my all time favorites...excellent!! With Amazon you can always count on the highest quality available. Good job and keep it going
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great premise, perfect writing, and a cast that has some of the best chemistry I have seen. One of the best shows on TV and in my top 10 all time.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Did not watch it, but my wife did and she loved it. She doesn't laugh so easily but she said it was amazing
B001C34HUS|1.0|O o o o Haven't read it.  This feature is a pain.  Give us a break.  It or of ad re  on in un opop op  .
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The author is a good storyteller. I liked the fact that this was a travel book within a book about running with some natural history thrown in. Whether you run or not; barefoot or shod, its a good read.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|By the 3rd episode you'll be hooked.  It's TV's version of a &#34;page turner.&#34;  Intense, suspenseful, interesting characters.  Brody's acting is the only part of the show I don't love.
B00F35BV64|4.0|the movie never had a dull moment.  i really enjoyed the movie from beginning to end.  i would recommend to others
1616551607|5.0|This is a must-have for any lovers of Amano's work. I've seen lots of items in this collection that I've never seen before. The silk-wrapped slipcase feels really high quality, and each of the pages are lovely and thick, and make excellent use of page space.
B009GX6600|5.0|I chose this rating because I love NCIS and it is amazing to be able to stream it right to my laptop to watch. I love how they have it in HD so it won't be crappy watching it. I would recommend this to every NCIS lover. If you like or love NCIS, get this.
B00C061HZY|4.0|Solid disco feel. Worth getting on Vinyl if you have good system as listening to it as an album is a good experience.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|When I saw Claire Danes won an emmy last week for her role in this series, I felt it was worth persuing since a few friends suggested this was right up my ally - espionage, government intrigue, middle east, and decent character development.  She is terrific and the writing for the show is excellent. Investing in the series now, while it's only in season 3, is worth the investment of time.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Was sorry when it ended; this is a very well written book and I highly recommend it to other readers!
B005V5WBFG|4.0|Bought this for my kindle fire HD. Provides good protection. Only problem is the constant reminder, would be nice if they were less frequent.
B00BRBIA6C|1.0|I don't know what I expected but this CD sucks. Only one song fells the same as ABBA. Terrible CD
B004ASNG04|3.0|Excellent book - the analysis, parameters and logic used to arrive at your results. I am an ardent student of history, and loved the book. Gripping, and &#34;un-put down able&#34; - if I may say so.<br /><br />But I think it is too focused on East as China - I would go so far as to use the word 'China syndrome' or 'China obsession'. There were equally developed societies in today's South America as well as today's India, which have been largely ignored. They were as developed on all the 4 parameters, if you care to dig deep.<br /><br />Sample this, if I may call it so, three small nuggets : there are only 3 oceans in the world - Pacific, Atlantic and Indian. Historians have through the centuries been so obsessed with India that they named an entire ocean after that country ... and you largely missed it. Or that Indians built a 22 kilometre bridge over sea connecting the mainland to today's Sri Lanka - clearly visible from space (you can check it on Google Earth); a civilisation that had such organisation ability ... Maps and not chaps, you said? Or the now submerged city of Dwarka off the west coast of India, which rivals Roman structures in size and scale - forget my opinion : as an archaeologist and a rational person, check out the last one which is right up your alley (FYI, Dwarka has been carbon dated to 3,200 BCE).<br /><br />I can give you similar examples for Mayan and Inca cultures. But I guess you get my point.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Anurag<br />CEO - GTNfW<br />www.gtnfw.org<br />anuragbhat@yahoo.com
B001TM14VC|5.0|even if you don't like tom cruise, how can you not love goose and top gun. my favorite is the beach volleyball scene, obviously.
B00004Z459|5.0|I have loved Linkin Park since this album. I will always love Linkin Park for as long as I live and beyond!!!!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I love this series, very well done! The cast is amazing and I really like the set design and wardrobe
B0083Z614S|5.0|At first I wasn't sure about this book but I kept reading and couldn't put it down...what magic and humanity...loved it!
B00EP0KYDO|1.0|There have been a few bad movies this year, but this one tops all of those by a wide margin.<br />Horrible, terrible, I had rather be stuck with my ex watching a chick flic. I hate to say that, because the son just stated on Tv that public schools are crap and private, home schooling is much better. Not exactly his words, but close enough. I really wanted this to be a good movie, but at last I give this word of advice. Stay away. Watch the news. Learn something.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|I remember reading this in high school and loving it and decided to read it again. Maybe now because I'm in my mid 40s and have more life experiences it really hit me harder. The story of someone who just wants to be liked and be normal, but just does not the abilities that most of us have ( and probably don't use to capacity), who would probably work harder than anyone else if he had the capacity. Then he gets the chance and realizes that his extraordinary intelligence is almost a bad thing in a way - he has the ability to see the not so good in people and he becomes cynical pretty quickly. Kind of a sad story of human nature in a way. But definitely worth reading.
B009SJ3GUK|1.0|I did not receive what I ordered! I wanted the actual DVDs to watch this series. Instead you gave me access, I guess, to some website. Total waste of money. Not happy, folks.
B009C7JS14|5.0|Wonderful app:  Does what it's supposed to do. Doesn't crash ....  Easy to understand.  A truly intuitive program.  You will be glad you got this.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Mr King kept the plot moving and successfully avoided the usual cliches. Thoroughly enjoyable, and a good visit with an old friend.
B001ECQ4DA|5.0|every one knows someone that is a super nerd -- this is a whole cast of super nerds. every stereotype of the nerd life is put out there for all to see
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is a really entertaining and different kind of sc ifi show in its premise and with a superb cast.  It is only sad that the really good TV series get cancelled so quickly, so there is only the one excellent season and the movie &#34;Serenity&#34; for fans to enjoy.<br /><br />Filmed and recorded well, it comes over crisp and clean.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great book!<br />A great way to spend an evening reading! I recommend it to anyone who loves a good heroine.
B00D6B4PUG|1.0|I ordered this app several hours ago and received a confirmation from Amazon.  the app is nowhere in sight. It is not appearing on any of my devices or on the cloud list NOR is it even showing up on my account.<br /><br />Not happy about being robbed. And who wants to go through a lengthy drawn out customer service ordeal over 99 coins!<br /><br />yup.. A rip-off.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|My son is a Cars fanatic. Lightening McQueen everything and between this and Maters Tall Tales, this is about all I've watched for the past 7 months.
B00CWVGBEO|1.0|I tried (very hard) to like this movie.<br /><br />In the end it is a series of badly-acted cliches, with Aaaaahnold in the starring role.  The stunts were minimal, the dialogue was on the third-grade level, and the action scenes were &#34;not&#34;.<br /><br />Yes, there's a couple booms and a little &#34;action&#34;.  But no, the end result was boredom and hoping we were near the end of the flick.<br /><br />Four thumbs down (in our clan).<br /><br />JDMc
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great book! Nice to see Percy and annabeth together again. I really enjoyed it and can't wait until the next one
B00F91H666|5.0|Disclaimer - I am not a horror-film connoisseur.  But I like a lot of action, big booms, chase scenes, and heroics.  Sometimes it's even good if there is a plot between the big booms and chase scenes - but plots are not mandatory.  (I'm a guy...)<br /><br />I have two teen sons who saw the &#34;regular&#34; version of WWZ at the movies.  They were raving about it.  So - one week we rented it and put it on the big screen at home.  Yes, there is a difference in intensity between the &#34;Unrated&#34; version and the movie version.<br /><br />Highly recommend.  Very scary.  Very fast zombies (which is un-nerving in a totally different way - they were more &#34;feral&#34; than &#34;zombie-like&#34;...)<br /><br />Crank up the subwoofer, get comfy on the couch, and prepare for a wild ride.  I was kind of tired afterward.<br /><br />JDMc
B005721Y7Y|5.0|everytime i watch it, i find something new. its a fantastic movie thats still relevant today. i dont regret renting.
0399230033|5.0|Buy this book.  Period.<br /><br />Looking back (our two sons are older teens now) this book and &#34;Fuzzy Yellow Ducklings&#34; were the two more interesting, impactful, and interactive books we had for our sons.<br /><br />Each of their copies is well-loved, well-worn, and (somewhat) chewed on.  But we kept them!<br /><br />If you are looking for a baby gift, this is it!  Buy this book plus the Fuzzy Yellow Ducklings - and the new mom (and dad) will have happy, interactive, fun reading for years to come.<br /><br />Been there, done that - and we have two sons who still love to read (even during their sulky angst-filled teenage years).<br /><br />JDMc
B0089EHWQE|4.0|But  it is well worth reading.  it gives one insight into a life one never wants to experience and also what a real &#34;care giver&#34; is.  Even knowing that there will be heart ache ahead, the reader will find humor and, devotion, and determination.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Disclaimer - I'm a techie guy.<br /><br />I saw the early reports of the &#34;Chrome&#34; device and started salivating.  Then I read a bit more, understood the basic model/features/limitations.  Less salivatory, but still neat.<br /><br />The device plugs into a standard TV HDMI port and uses your local wi-fi network to stream video directly from the source.<br /><br />The device does require a separate power supply (standard USB power), which can be pulled from an existing power cube or from the small powersupply included in the box.  There is also a short (5-inch?) HDMI extension cable that can be used to connect to hard-to-reach TV ports (and this connector acts as a small antennae for wifi - according to the docs).<br /><br />You initially plug the device into your TV's HDMI port, provide power, and voila - it starts broadcasting its own little mini-WAP (wireless network).  You use your tablet to temporarily connect to that mini-network, configure the device, let it know how to attach to your regular Wifi (userid/pw) - and whoosh - you are now ChromeCasting.<br /><br />Instead of using a remote-control (there is none), you use your handy Android or iOS (Apple) tablet or phone device.  You can play from any mobile (or desktop via Chrome browser) device on the wifi network.  The HDMI connector is &#34;smart&#34; and when you start playing to Chromecast - it will tell your TV that there is new content streaming - so your &#34;smart&#34; TV should autoselect the Chromecast source.  (Nifty!)<br /><br />Here's the catch - the mobile application (running on your tablet or phone) must be written to support the Chromecast video streaming.<br /><br />While Apple build their iOS operating system to support their proprietary &#34;AirPlay&#34; - Google's Android can support its version of &#34;ChromeCast&#34; and other mobile apps can build in specific support for Chromecast.<br /><br />That's kind of limiting right now.  Basically an iOS device can run Chrome, Youtube, or Netflix viewing apps - and send data to the large-screen Chromecast is connected to.  Nifty but limited.<br /><br />Hopefully other apps (Amazon PRIME VIdeo??) will add this functionality - soon.  (Amazon's iOS PRIME video player still does not handle Apple's AirPlay either...  So more growth potential on both fronts.)<br /><br />JDMcNetflix viewing apps - and send data to the large-screen Chromecast is connected to.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|Not your usual Reacher novel, more details, a better storyline complex plot with several sub plots.  I  would definitely recommend it.
B00991TCOG|4.0|Love Lindsey - and her studio work is very precise.  (Some of her live shows when she is spinning, kicking, and galavanting - not as crisp as the studio version.)<br /><br />Cool niche - dubstep violin!<br /><br />JDMc
B00DJZR4A2|5.0|For those who have panned this album...get real this excellent stuff from Elton.<br />YES it does go back to his very early sound...and for those who say it's just repeating things from his past...Well if you had done 33 duet or solo albums your going find things that sound the same.<br />This is just true musicianship at it's best....and as for the folks who say Elton's voice is tired....Well I think he sounds amazing...This is one of the best albums he's done in a very very long time.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Dr. Sleep is the novel I've hoped for since I read \\"The Shining\\" all those years ago.  This book didn't terrify me as horribly as \\"The Shining\\" did, but it was the cause of more than a few nights of sleeping with the night-light on!  I really enjoyed catching up with all of the old characters from the Overlook Hotel.  I highly recommend this book.
B00EBF29G8|2.0|Well Intended but Scatter-shot & Disappointingly Oversimplified.<br /><br />As a student of economics and history, a progressive, and a devoted reader, I found this book somewhat engaging, at times interesting, but messy, overly committed to its theory of \\"shock,\\" under-researched, and clearly preaching to the choir.<br /><br />While on the one hand, Klein does offer a series of case histories to prove her thesis, she blatantly avoids entire decades that do not fit into her very narrow frame.<br /><br />Perhaps this book would have worked much better if it were presented as a book of short essays; it has the feel of a book that was stitched together from essays anyway.<br /><br />Lastly, I must mention this.  Klein seems to put for the premise that \\"shock doctrine\\" is a tool only of the extreme right, the hard line capitalists of the West.  Why ignore the clear examples of similar tactics by communist regimes?  Is the CIA the only villain of the 20th century?  A little balance would have made Klein's work sound much more like history and less like the nuance-free, \\"we're right and they are wrong,\\" manifesto this book was.<br /><br />I returned the book.<br /><br />Jeremy
B006GKHE6G|5.0|My son wanted me to download this game onto my Kindle... needless to say I think I've been playing it more then him!
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie. Lits if action, good acting and terrific effects. Well worth buying to add to my collection.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I LOVED this app until the latest update and now it is freezing on both my iPhone and my kindle. I have not had this problem before. Also I wish it would go back to being cheaper to revive the first time or at least use bananas instead of coins since it wants you to revive so many times for mission goals
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I was hoping to be able to take photos and video of events and other people, not of myself. Please tell me how I can take reverse pictures and videos. Thank you.
B00785P2QC|3.0|meh i guess its ok. fine to waste a little time but i got bored pretty fast. takes forever to load too.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Hey! I love my audible books and this was the first I have had that has a man and a woman reading. I loved it. I love listening in my car and this is one that I probably wasted a lot of time and gas just hanging out in my car...driving home slower...to work slower.<br />I must say that Amy in this book is so smart...even the author is so smart or rather clear headed. With my ADD there is no way I could figure out how to do something like this. I must admit I had figured out what had happened pretty early on but I can tell you that it does not diminish the story line.<br />It does seem set up a little to have another book...which I would be happy to read.<br />They are filming the movie down close to my hometown in Cape Giradeau, MO. Ben Affleck is playing Nick I guess and not sure of the rest. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT IN AUDIO!!
B0025KVLU6|5.0|I know of no one who doesn't immediately recognize this album Without a doubt an all time Beatles favorite smash hit!
B009Z8FUB2|5.0|Absolutely beautiful music! As gorgeous as the movie is. Predominantly violins. I love every part of it and will enjoy listening to it for many years.
B00DDXJRJG|4.0|I was skeptical at first but this app really works and u can actually tell a difference in the music quality
B001OGWY1W|4.0|My wife loved this movie but I wasn't quite as blown away as she was. I'm not sure that I care as much for these darker versions as much as other people do but it's an entertaining movie nonetheless.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|I was reading the negative comments on this movie about 75% of them said it wasn't like the book. Well to you people did you really expect it to be? But as I checked everyone of you criticize on any movie because it does not match the book or the original movie or the comic book. Well to all of you I say to you it seems like you watch a lot of movies stop watching movies you aren't going to like any movies anyway.  I read and I watched the movie guess what I still enjoy the movie like this one it was Great it was a story based on the book I checked the credits no where did it say this movie is exactly like the book. So for all you people that don't like good gore and good acting in a Horror movie don't watch it if you want it like the book you will be disappointed. If on the other hand you want a good movie with no preconceptions this and Many more movies are for you and you will enjoy this movie. It was done well for the type of movie it is expect a good view and you will have it.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Brilliant for when you're about to go out for some hillwalking or just don't want to look out the window!
B00ARI9CDQ|1.0|Apparent lots of people enjoy DailyMail as much as I do, AND are just as frustrated with the app's constant stoppjng and crashing and freezing. (oh my) It's like on ebay: fix your app and I'll fix my review.
0385341008|5.0|I loved it, passed it on to my mom who loved it, passed it to grandma, loved it, etc. I think my copy has been read by 6 individuals and everyone has loved it! I finally got my copy back and look forward to reading it again.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Is it my favorite album from my favorite band?  Nope.  But that would be like asking a mother or father of 10 to say which kid is their favorite.  They all have their high points and low points.  But, Dream Theater definitely delivered on this album.  The musicianship is superb. JLB's voice is in top form.  JR is truly a wizard on the keys and JP is brilliant as ever.  The Genie is unbelievable...if my hands were only half as fast I would be happy.  And finally, JM really stands out on this one.  Wish he would write more as his lyrics are great.
B00000IUT7|4.0|I hate buying batteries and therefore try to not have toys that take them in our house. This is such a big hit that I can somewhat look passed it. I like that it can go forward or backwards and it does a good job pulling 2-3 train cars. I just wish the battery life was a bit longer, although even when it's dead it still gets played with so I guess it's not so bad.
B0089MXRII|5.0|What a delightful collection of short stories!<br />This is the second book I've read from Julia Gousseva, so I knew the style of writing and the great descriptions that were bound to fill the fill the kindle pages - she didn't let me down. This collection of short stories is touching, and gives a great picture of a different place and time through the eyes of an innocent child. A great evening read.
0395389496|5.0|We love to read this book at Christmas time. My son likes the book even more than the movie which is saying a lot as he loves movies. The illustrations are beautiful and the story is the perfect length to keep his attention but feel special.
023076651X|5.0|An inspiring and informative book for people looking at starting their own business, but without breaking the bank. Chris delves into all the aspects of starting a business with wonderful advice from people around the world who are doing what they love - and getting paid for it.  Well done Chris. Just the inspiration I need.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|There's no denying Steve Jobs was a fascinating, brilliant individual. What I loved about this book was the detail in describing him as a regular, very human man with foibles like the rest of us. Life is in the details, and while Steve Jobs lived a larger-than-life existence, he was really an ordinary man in so many ways. This book explored what made him the man he was, from his quirky personality to his deep love for his wife, to his unquenchable thirst for knowledge. He was also highly practical, and I think that was one of the traits I loved best about him when reading this book. Who doesn't see the logic in wearing the same outfit every day?  :)
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is the first Fireproof Games I've played but hopefully will not be the last! The challenge for me was so much fun and the touch screen was so much better that using a mouse. We need more games like this!!!
B003BKF696|5.0|This album reminds me of a group called Frazier Chorus. The song &#34;Endland is what sold me. This particular song reminds me of a quiet peaceful gray day in Seattle. The rest of the album is quiet and soothing. Great album.
B0035Q4AFC|5.0|Mr. Downey can be proud of this film. A fair and accurate depiction of Mr. Chaplin. So sad to see how poorly he was treated in this country by nuts like McCarthy and that queer Hoover.
B000GPIPVU|5.0|Great album especially the song &#34;be here now&#34; this song was featured in the movie &#34;be here now&#34; ethereal and calming. This album is mostly folk with keyboards adding another layer of sound. In the past I have purchased albums for 1 track and I have to say I did the same with this one. I was pleasantly surprised to find additional tracks that have the same sound and quality of the 1st track.
B00EZZ77ZM|5.0|Jack Johnson delivers again...right on time:)<br />great lyrics, catcing chords....Another for my daughter and I to cherish... thank you Jack!
B0081336FO|5.0|Well written, fantastic stories, great acting and well shot.<br />This series takes everything you love about Sherlock Holmes and makes it better!
B00DHPN7G4|5.0|I have been using pro aim resistance products for over a year an a half now an I love them!! I've tried just about all of them, an depending on your game style an how aggressive your thumbs are each one of the many different AAA products works amazingly!! Definitely a must buy for any FPS player who takes the game seriously
0399255370|5.0|If you really want to see children enjoy a book, this is a great one.  This book has been on heavy reading rotation in my house for well over a month and the naked Peach Crayon makes my kids laugh and doesn't seem to be getting old anytime soon.  I personally love they way it's written from the snarky crayon's perspective.  I have even heard my daughter say \\"When was the last time you saw a kid excited about coloring wheat?\\"  I  really don't think it's meant be thought about too deeply and should just be enjoyed.  The drawings are truly wonderful.
0547258305|4.0|it was more of a romance book, and the story was kinda slow<br />is not bad but it's not the kind of book I like<br />even so i kinda of enjoyed it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I remain completely addicted to this high class soap opera--Maggie Smith remains an absolute joy.  will certainly be buying season 4.
B000EXZI14|5.0|I would buy this again should something happen to it - lost, etc.  Great music -- Puts a smile on your face and a little bootie to your move.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I started this series in 1992.  I got addicted and waited every fall for the new edition.  I think Mr. Sanderson did a fabulous job carrying on with the story and bringing it to a satisfying conclusion.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Beautiful, compelling story of lives intertwined both in joyful but also in hard heartbreaking moments. An insight of the hardships lived in Afghanistan over the past few decades,
B00F875N98|4.0|Another great album from kings of Leon.  I own them all, and this album follows how the band is evolving...I like where it is going.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Good game but it would be nice if your energy would reload faster. Very addicting and good when your bored.
B00CVCG87O|5.0|This album has a subtle tension all the way throughout and yet it doesn't at the same time, hard to do music wise, love the intense thread throughout the entire album it's very satisfying to my ears...
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a fun game of hidden items. Wish diamonds regenerated like energy. Don't waste what you are given. Have fun.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I wish you could put more of them out. I have completed mine and need more. Fun game. Gets your mine thinking.
B004G6009U|5.0|great move, bright colors, songs are catchy enough to keep you interested in what is going on, and what can i say frying pans.
B0013LL2Z2|3.0|Years ago I guess I watched the pre run of the made for TV series of Logan's Run.<br />This movie was ok and somewhat entertaining. Maybe if I wasn't expecting the TV version I would have liked it better.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|If you like star wars or angry birds you will love this game a lot of fun get this game
B007THA4FI|1.0|Just couldn't quite get into this book. I didn't finish it. Just couldn't make myself read it. Hate it wasn't better.
B002LB7S10|5.0|This movie has been out for awhile, I love it!! One of my favorite go to's if I want a good suspensful movie!
0744014956|5.0|This version of the guide comes with a high quality lithograph in its own cardboard envelope as well as detailed layouts of every inch of this enormous game.  The cover is amazing and the overall quality is at the height of special edition game guides.  Ive really gotten into collecting these guides since they no longer come as a small booklet in the game package.  Between the map and blueprint that comes in the special edition of GTA V there are few other game duos that can match this set.  Even Bethesda's Fallout 3 is given a run for its money when looking at these collectibles.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|percy jackson and the olympians the lightning thief was just a fun new story about the greek gods. it was different from the book yes, but i love it so much that i am willing to over look the fact that they changed so much. logan lerman could not have played a better percy jackson he was just perfect, i am very excited to watch the sea of monsters movie to see it its closer to the book and to see more camp half-blood super excited about it. this is a great family film to watch with you kids to. no sex or bad words and that is rare now a days. wonderful movie loved it lots.
B001AQO3QA|3.0|This is a great collection of any scifi  lovers darkest dreams. The Compilation of all the special editions over the years is here in high definition BLURAY.  The set is really nicely packaged, but the discs themselves are pretty hard to take out.  I am thinking of getting some real bluray cases to put them in so they don't get damaged over the years. The presentation is great, the practicality is not.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Smallville has been my favorite show for more than 6 years. so i am very happy to finally getting the dvds so i can rewatch all my favorite episodes. its so strange to see how young all are favorite characters are and see how much they grow and change over the next 9 years. this is perfect for any smallville fan.
030789701X|5.0|This guide is your ticket to every corner of Skyrim's expansive world.  Its got spoilers sure, but the research and planning I did with this thing helped me get to the higher levels faster. (and we know that with the legendary edition those levels are now endless).  The included map is useful for looking for specific points of interest while using the in game map to triangulate where you are and where you need to go.  The cover could have been a little nicer, I was expecting more embossment and the cover to be thicker, but the book is huge and costs are high enough as it is. All in all, between the two ribbon markers and the over 1100 pages, this is at the front line in game guides.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Love this app. I have it on all my electronics. Easy for non tech savvy people to install and use. One of the first things I always install with new purchases. Love how simple it is.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|We area a Castle fan and have been waiting for season 5 as I had to travel and missed some of season 5 Now I get to watch all the episodes I missed and enjoy the missing byplay :)
B00867GHS8|5.0|Looks amazing, the 3d is awesome, and was a great price. The item shipped quickly and if you like the movie you'll love it in 3d.
B00DXP7L88|1.0|Poor Dexter. The first four seasons of this show are amazing. After Rita died, the show went down hill with a quickness. It went on at least three seasons too long with the final season being the worst. It started off strong with Deb being on drugs and no longer working with Dexter but went left field after the first three episodes. The storyline sucked and was predictable (killer on the loose, Dexter has to catch him) and there were new character's I didn't give a damn about (Dr.Vogel?). I hated how they had fillers for 90% of the episodes and the characters that have been on this show for years weren't given anything of substance to work with ( What was the point of adding Masuka's daughter?).<br /><br />Than some stuff was too unbelievable. For example, Hannah (Dexter's lover), went on the run after being arrested for murder at the end of the 7th season. Fast forward to this season, Hannah is back in Miami (with no disguise) and is now married to a billionaire who she later ends up killing. Like really? Do the writers think us viewers are stupid? A billionaire is going to marry a fugitive??? Then after she killed him, we (the viewers) never heard any more about him. A billionaire is not going missing and there is no massive hunt to find him. Also, the scene where Harrison, (the 4 year old son) falls off the treadmill and it CLEARLY is a grown man acting as his stunt double is just cringe worthy. It's like the director didn't even try.<br /><br />Last, I hated the ending. Deb dies, Hannah runs off with Harrison, Dexter fakes his death and becomes a lumberjack, and his co-workers NEVER find out he was a serial killer. Eight seasons. Eight long seasons. All that time wasted for Dexter to just fake his death and become a lumberjack. Terrible. The writers should have went the ''Breaking Bad'' route and gave the viewers what they want and that was for Dexter to get found out. The hunter becomes the hunted.<br /><br />If you haven't seen all 8 seasons of Dexter, don't bother. Just stop at 4. You won't miss anything trust me
B008MU8ZNO|5.0|One of the best B movies ever made! Was so excited to see this movie come it on blu ray. No brainer. A must have.
B003B02PEU|3.0|Good book to tell us about down south in 1960-1970 . Slow paced book with too much stress on details .
B007D2XSW0|5.0|One of the best photo editing apps that I've used so far. And I got it when it was free!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Not a &#34;feel good&#34; book but a great story with a lot of historical<br />details about life on a plantation in the late 1700's.
B00471JSR4|4.0|Saw this in the theatre and liked it. Gave it a few more views and decided that I needed to own it.
0316067598|5.0|Received a promised.  This NEW book was  a replacement for the used one I purchased but it was in less then Poor / Horrible condition.  Very happy to have a \\"CLEAN\\" and \\"UNDAMAGED\\"  copy in my hands.  Well worth the additional money spent to have a clean and undamaged copy in my hands.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|It was a great game epic  I<br />Loved it so much that I got the other game front line commando the only bad thing is that you need money (real money) to get guns
B007IK44CK|4.0|Same basic ideas as the first 3 movies but with new characters/ideas.  No major plot twists but that isnt what these movies are meant for.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great brain strain! It's really good exercise for your brain! I really like this game it's a good way to keep sharp!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game, and so does my son. What a great time waster...it's one of the best games I've played. I just wish we could use bananas to buy Gru coins..
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I love this game. When I first saw this, I was a bit confused. I wasn't sure if I'd like it, but I decided to try it. A week in, and I've got a level 11 park with 2 islands. This game is addictive, and really fun! 4 of 5!
B00E0PT0FC|5.0|See Dan Bilawsky's All About Jazz Review (http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=45257) for a great review of this album. I am unable to do any better.  But in short this Holland sans horns with a bit of fusion but not throughout thanks to Kevin Eubanks. Works very well.
B00ATSBIIG|4.0|Great game to play when you want to relax. Great pattern and a variety of different difficulties. The free game is a great place to start.
B000ID37RM|5.0|I am (ahem...) past fifty, from the South, an English lit and language undergraduate major and an attorney. I can't believe that I waited until this age to read the book and then watch the movie. As is generally the case, the book is much better than the movie, and both mean a lot more if you do a little Internet research on the author of the book, Harper Lee. Imdb is also an excellent resource for information on the movie, particularly on Gregory Peck.<br /><br />Despite my the-book-is-better-than-the-movie evaluation, the movie is still awesome. This movie was Robert Duvall's cinema debut. Gregory Peck is amazing as Atticus Finch, the protagonist. Even though I had not seen the entire movie, while reading the book I heard Gregory Peck's voice each time I read a line by Atticus. Scout (Mary Bedham), Jem (Phillip Alford), and Dill (Lee's portrait in literature of her friend Truman Capote) are unforgettable characters, as well. The African-American actors are extremely talented, too.<br /><br />Although I grew up in the 60's and 70's, I can imagine this is very much how things were in 1932 Alabama. Made in 1962, very shortly after the book came out, and in black-and-white, the movie provides the same nostalgic aura as &#34;The Last Picture Show.&#34; Released immediately prior to the culmination of the Civil Rights Movement, it was way before its time.<br /><br />If you miss this one, you have done yourself more of an injustice than Maycomb County did to the Tom Robinson!
B004JK61K0|1.0|No matter what combination of manual settings I used from an impressive amount of internet searching, I could not get this to connect to my Comcast email account on my Kindle HD.  Not necessarily the app's fault because nothing else works either, but it did not work for me.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|im not a trekkie but the last 2 movies are great for people just now wanting to get into it.  into darkness blew me away.
B00F8GYC1Y|3.0|The game itself is fun and offers challenges, plus fun characters. I've had the game freeze several times. It also did not allow me to progress to the next level on one segment, even though I had scored enough to pass (three stars). I had to uninstall, reinstall and start over. The technical issues are the reason for the lower rating. The game itself is great.
B00D7OMNXS|5.0|its a definate buy.  i love this movie even though the mandarin was screwed.  i would recommend it any way.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Couldn't put it down - a few tough parts to read due to some of the gory content but all in all - Good read right to the end!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I never expected this book to reach out and slap me in the face, but it did. Read it, because it will make you laugh and cry and shiver and love. And those are all the best parts of reading.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|Boring, slow, and uninteresting.<br />Appallingly bad and dissapointing.<br />The other one star reviews are accurate.<br />Can the HBO writers save the show?<br />They will need to avoid this book.<br />&#34;You know nothing GRRM.&#34;
B000MD7OKY|5.0|Love it, wish they made more movies like this today. Grace Kelly was so beautiful and elegant, such a great actress.
B002RT2BXQ|4.0|Although I liked the movie, it was nothing like the book. I suppose it's very hard to capture everything from this amazing book into a 1.5 hour movie. Ayn Rand made a valiant effort, but again, nothing like the book. The book is BRILLIANT!
B000UZPIAW|4.0|A very good  but sad story about addiction and self destruction. As a musician this is an eye opener. Awesome read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|We love minion rush. Kids can't get enough of this game. Ok....Ok I do too. It does need more levels.
B008BQ8YHQ|2.0|really enjoyed the first season.  the second was all about firm in-fighting...majorly dragged out the &#34;how do I tell rachel my devastating secret&#34; angst & turned the lead woman at the firm from an interesting character into a negative stereotype of successful women (clearly given how much power she has, she must be an amoral manipulative b____).  too bad, loved gina t. in firefly & was glad to watch her on a new show.  one upside - you have to pay for season 3 and we're no longer interested in watching.
B00F91G5BS|4.0|The cinematography of this movie is crazy. A lot of flu ridden &#34;zombies&#34;. Could use more one on one zombie attacks.
0744014956|5.0|Looks good and covers many info on the game. Also pretty good packaging and It came in 1 day early of its estimated arrival date!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|A fascinating historical study about the period and place in which Jesus lived and how Jesus of Nazareth (Son of Man) became Jesus Christ and Son of God.
0765363836|4.0|For the most part, I liked this book. The idea behind it is very good, and is a nice look into human psyche. The writing style was good. I found a few grammatical mistakes, but those could be the result of printing and not the author's writing.<br /><br />There's two things I disliked about the book, though:<br />1) It's too narrow. The entire book focused on a small number of characters, all of whom are physicists. A lot more could have been done if the characters had more diverse backgrounds or outlooks.<br />2) I HATED Lloyd's second future. The idea was too utopian, and did not fit with the rest of the book.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|My first Seiko automatic, long time ago, although with metal strap, cost about 5 times as much.  Re this purchase, everything about it is just fine. The strap is not  problem for me to adjust and secure.  Yes, the canvas strap, which seems to be very strong and durable, can pick up odor from sweat etc.  I was able to clean a similar strap with dish detergent on a toothbrush, thorough warm rinsing, and air drying. Just use the crown's 3 positions to adjust the time, day and date - skip the instructions.
B003TZCFR4|5.0|Lovely voice, all the songs are great. Dance me to the end of love is my favorite.Outstanding album for a first time purchase, had never heard of this artiste before.
B000055Y0X|5.0|The &#34;Johnny Comes Marching Home&#34; background music and the final Slim Pickens' scene makes you yearn for the Apocalypse The End of the World as we know it as it should be done................<br /><br />Worthy of note Major T.

B0094BB4TW|4.0|Normally, I'll go on my desktop to log in to Facebook, because it is so tiny on my Kindle.  And every time I try to make the picture bigger, I wind up accidentally touching a post, that takes me to another person's screen.  That part is annoying, but in an emergency, I find it very convenient to have Facebook on my Kindle.
B0034G4P80|5.0|A nice little story of a God of Thunder, his frustrated ne'er do well step-brother (He should wear a tag stating, &#34;I can't be trusted.&#34; ) and a tornado chaser turned astrophysicist.<br /><br />Best scene? Dr Foster gets religion. OMG!
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|This set collects the first 6 Star trek movies in one set with all kinds of extras and for 30 bucks it's a great value.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Granted the actors are getting a bit long in the tooth but the time travel worked rather well. Better than BTTF 1 (Don't get me started on Time Travel inconsistencies!)
B00ENV1HPY|5.0|It's been far too long to be in a world without a new Mazzy Star album.  Albeit the few Hope Sandoval CDs were pretty good in the interim, they just didn't have the same impact and mystery as does Mazzy Star when it records as a whole.  I love this album, it's wonderful.  It could've sucked and I still would have purchased it...but it really is a welcomed gem from a phenomenal band.
B001AVCFJM|4.0|The movie was good if you can totally discount the Laws of Physics! An original script premise would have been better.
B00F6NKFQK|5.0|The stories in this book are hilarious.  I love to read and once in awhile I need to get off my usual reading track of adventure, murder, mystery, and suspense.  So I decided to pick this book up and I am sure glad that I did.  It made me laugh from page one all the way to the end.  Oleg puts a great spin on his stories and if you need a laugh get this book.  I truly look forward to more from Oleg, especially when I need a laugh.
B000FS9FC6|5.0|Natalie shorn of her locks is a bummer but she is fantastic in the role.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving? Hell it could have been anyone since he never removes the mask, (even David Prowse,) but he was superb as well.
B001P06GX4|5.0|It is a fun game for adults and children.  We can play it with our grandchildren, but we and our adult children also enjoy it.
B00F5FBE82|5.0|I'm not a fan of new rap, but this album is great. Drake has no rapping skills but it does get women wet. So, hey, why not? Am I right?
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|I am not very good at this game & get frustrated sometimes but I do enjoy it & hope to improve my game.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Awesome calculator, just what I needed. Awesome big numbers . Great job . Thanks very much. I recommend this calculator to everyone that's looking for an awesome calculator.
B00CS74W0C|4.0|I thought the series was good. I have already read it twice.  A little tamer than 50 Shades of Gray.
B009FZFONO|4.0|I actually thought the episode right before this was better but all in all it was a good end to the season and I can't wait to watch the new season as it unfolds. The governor is one crazy dude and the loss of some additional characters was good for the story.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|so incredibly user friendly, great for doodling and my family loves to play tic tac toe on it !  thanks
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I like the way the characters are natural, there is nothing fiction about them. Bill, Eddie, Ben, Stan, Mike and Beverly, they could all have been real people I grew up with.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST DOCUMENTARIES I HAVE EVER SEEN!! DAVE GROHL ABSOLUTLEY KILLED IT WITH THIS ONE!! THE WILL BE WATCHED MANY TIMES IN MY HOUSE HOLD!!
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Love the game itself but I am disappointed with how pricey the ponies are and required ponies are now costing gems and other forms of payment other than the coins... I can't afford to drop the money to buy gems so I can play a game. Other than that, I love it. It's fun and they did a great job with the whole construction of the game!
1439190976|3.0|The consulting company McKinsey \\"helped invent what we think of as American capitalism and spread it to every corner of the world,\\" Duff McDonald writes in his new book.<br /><br />If one accepts Mr. McDonald's idea of McKinsey as a stand-in for American capitalism, then it's not a particularly heroic tale.<br /><br />The capitalist consultants ended up doing lots of work for Enron and celebrating its business model. The McKinsey consultants also did some \\"feeding at the government trough,\\" working for a Tanzanian tyrant and big-government British institutions such as the BBC and the National Health Service. The climax is the conviction of the firm's one-time managing director, Rajat Gupta, for giving illegal stock tips to hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam.<br /><br />Mr. McDonald also suggests, but doesn't come quite out and say so directly, that the problems at McKinsey may be read not only as those of American capitalism but of American elites. \\"Yes, it's elitist,\\" another one-time McKinsey managing director, Ron Daniel, acknowledged. Or as one former McKinsey consultant, James Kwak, put it, the Harvard and Yale graduates that McKinsey hires \\"are driven by desire for status and fear of failure.\\"<br /><br />Mr. Daniel described McKinsey consultants as \\"a dull, anonymous bunch\\" and while he may have been being disarmingly modest, there's something telling about the fact that the most colorful and prominent McKinsey consultants in this account -- Ken Ohmae and Tom Peters -- both left the firm. Mr. Peters left McKinsey eight months before his book In Search of Excellence, which sold 5 million copies, came out.<br /><br />The other non-anonymous figure who attracts attention is Marvin Bower, a graduate of Brown, Harvard Law School, and Harvard Business School and the man who really built McKinsey into what it is. A consultant once told Bower of his plans for an upcoming ski trip. The book reports that Mr. Bower, in all apparent seriousness, \\"said he regarded skiing as unprofessional ...'You're running the risk of breaking your leg, and having that get in the way of client work.'\\"<br /><br />Mr. McDonald's book shows that kind of focus has its virtues, but also has its limits.unprofessional ...'You're running the risk of breaking your leg, and having that get in the way of client work.'\\"<br /><br />Mr. McDonald's book shows that kind of focus has its virtues, but also has its limits.
B003YTPS7O|4.0|Wife likes romance / feel good movies and it was a representative film from that perspective. Interesting story, predictable with at times difficult French accents.
B004ZH66XO|5.0|This  game is super fun and relatively simple. It is ouside Ad free, and does not force you to spend real money in the app. It would definitely be worth the $0.99 download.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Was a little hard to figure out in the beginning, but once I began playing it  was easier. Definitely recommend.
B007THA4FI|3.0|you will like the book.  It's not exactly my preferred reading genre, yet it was good enough for me to finish and the ending was the high point IMHO.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|My daughter is reading these books. She is loving them and can't wait to get the next one. She is on her second book.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I am able to sync my notes with my tablet, phone, and PC. I love the convenience it offers! Highly recommended!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Could not stop watching until I finished all the episodes. Damn good show! Recommend to anyone who likes a mix of witty humor and a little drama.
B007EC27QM|4.0|I really like this having this handy device on my kindle. The price was really great, too! What a steal!
B003G4W49C|2.0|this is a weird book.  children don't talk like this. It's a depressing  awful book.  does nothing for the soul. Weird, poor writing too
B008P1EWIM|4.0|I am really glad I purchased this app. My daughter just moved to New Zealand. Their seasons are the opposite of ours, so now I can check their weather whenever I want.  The price was great.
B002NWXRYY|5.0|This is a funny movie.  I love Goldie Hawn!  This is an oldie but a goodie.  Worth to have it
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|A fun movie that shows older people enjoying life with their similar talents.  Light hearted fun with well played characters.
B00422LESO|2.0|It's OK nothing to write home about.  It is sort of silly.  It's OK will wait for it go to the dollar movie thearter when the movie goes there.  WHo knows the movie might be there.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I had been thinking about investing in the Rosetta program when this popped up on my kindle apps.  I tried it based on everyone else's reviews and was pleasantly surprised.  It is fun to use and they repeat, repeat, repeat in different ways that make the lessons stick.  I am married into an Hispanic family and learning Spanish is my way to try to fit in a little better, or at least know if I am being talked about!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game it is very intriguing and it has beautiful animation it's a perfect game for smaller children and its not complicated at all I really enjoy this game please get it you'll be glad
B0027MJU00|3.0|didn't finish reading this one, perhaps I'd gotten as much of this author's voice from reading 'gone girl' as I wanted.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use, fully functional. Nice to have it available to use while in process of balancing checkbook and paying bills.
B009GEFXLC|4.0|I generally do not watch a lot of TV, but I do like this series.<br />I like the interaction between all of the main characters<br />I would recommend this tv series to others.
B005VPRET4|5.0|My 9 year old daughter just loves Lego friends.  She has been asking for this set for a couple of months and I found it a great price.<br />Since my daughter is a Lego fan, she found it easy with a little challenges to built it.<br /><br />We just loved
B00CWY76CC|5.0|THIS GAME IS SPECTACULAR!!!! Never get tired of it! Got me stumped  ( That NEVER happens! )  many times! BEST. GAME. EVER.
B000VX4X3G|5.0|Excellent shoe. Fits perfect to size & the price was very reasonable. I've gotten plenty of compliment on this shoe
B00F88H5K2|4.0|I wanted to see this movie because while growing up Liberace seemed like a weird character who really could play the Piano. I could never see the fascination the women had in him because he dressed so bizarre & talked strange. Seems like after seeing the movie he did not have a happy life, and he used people as they used him. This is one of those movies you have to see for yourself, the whole kissing thing between Michael Douglas & Matt Damon sure seems to have been blown out of proportion, not much of what you don't see on regular TV, which is not much to say about the quality of either form of media these days.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|Lois Lowry expresses the awakening of a boy who discovers the beauty and burdens of human choices. I appreciated the ease of the read and couldn't put the book down. Lowry is a very talented author, and the book flowed seemingly without effort.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Love this series!  It is full on secrets, love, desire and everything else peole want to read! I absolutely love this!
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|Absolutely fantastic ending to the trilogy. I loved every minute of it. It was probably my favorite book in the series. Atwood is the BEST!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I absolutely love this book! This series is so riveting and exciting. Forbidden love, enduring fights and of course uncontrollable desire!
B008B1BL4E|4.0|We are always tempted to look for a simple answer to a complex question. In this book, the author demonstrates that there is no easy answer to the question of what caused the First World War. Instead, he provides a detailed, step-by-step narrative that shows all too clearly how the leaders of Europe stumbled into war.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game! variety is great but I wish it was easier to get more points to buy new games.
B0058VW36U|3.0|It's tots lame. Hate it. If  anyone likes this game they're tots crazy&amp;that's going to make me tots stinking mad!!!!!!!!!! My age is 16years old.
B00EDPFJA4|4.0|This album puts Drake on top & seals himself as the best, most diverse YMCMB artist as well as in the rap game. Raw, edgy beats, great delivery without any filler. If you like Drake before, or just caught on with 'Hold on we're going home', this album is worth multiple spins. This will be a new age classic for sure.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|The game at first was fine but I can't get passed one level so I guess that means that I'm stuck there. This is a total bummer &amp;it totally sucks!!! By the way my age is 16 years old.
B00640UICA|4.0|The beginning levels of the game lead you to believe that its an easy kids game but all that changes as the levels increase. The problem is you can't put it down once you start playing. It becomes very challenging in the higher levels especially when you try to get all the stars on the level. Very fun and addictive.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I purchase SwiftKey as a free app of the day. It was a great find. After over a month of use I am 37 percent faster with messages and typing thanks to SwiftKey.<br /><br />Most of the time SwiftKey is great.  However sometimes it has a mind of its' own and refuses to enter words I clearly intended.<br /><br />By and large though it's wonderful.
B002V092B0|5.0|She shares an amazing experience from within, what a gift to all of us. Anyone will benefit from this book, for stroke victims and their family is obligatory.
0307949486|1.0|While rape is a horrible crime, and ought to be punished (didn't we used to have a death penalty) I can't recommend a book that celebrates more torture as revenge for torture.  There is too much hate in this world already
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Tearing through this book!! LOVE Mr. King, and so glad Danny's grown and can help someone else (existentially speaking)!!! LOVE the reference to the Thomas Harris' Hannibal series!!! Frederica Bimmel may be gone, but not forgotten!!! LOL.<br /><br />Was somewhat disappointed with this novel. Mr. King seems to have backed off on the hard-core horror. Still, enjoyed it.
B00EB6ENXO|3.0|If you hate the Twist,you would hate the movie,but if you like the twist,you would love the movie. It all depends.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed th I s game.  I think this a perfect game to start with, if you want to get into escape games.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|I like the movie.  An interesting story line, Morgan Freeman, Tom Cruise, what's not to like.  There's no stunt double for Cruise.  He does it all.  The technical aspects are awesome.  Smooth segues into high octane action.
B001BANK32|4.0|Well, it's not my favorite Stephen Kings' book but still I like it very much. Author created sort of dark and disquieting world and let the reader go into it. Main characters are very deeply described (in contrast to the movie, where, for example, Wendy is nothing but an ordinary, scared woman) as well as relations between them. Gradual transition of Jack - from &#34;almost&#34; good father to the monster is very convincing. Good book, I don't regret the money I spent for it.
0380018179|4.0|It's been a long time since I read the book, details forgotten, but I enjoyed it as much now as the first time.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Having successfully used this app on my previous cell phone and tablet.  I was surprised that it did not work at all on my new cell phone.  I tried various things, including the chat &#34;help&#34; provided by the site. After many hours trying to &#34;fix&#34; the problem, various downloads, trying earlier versions, going into my cell phone dealer and having them try to solve it...the conclusion is: it just does not work!
B00E88YNJY|4.0|Just when you think you're listening to blues, you hear bluegrass.<br /><br />Just when you are sure it's bluegrass, you hear soul.<br /><br />And when you finally conclude that it's soul, gospel is hitting your ears.<br /><br />And now that you think...<br /><br />Well you get the picture. You can't pin down the genre because she blends them effortlessly. A master of all, I'd reckon.
B0060AY85C|3.0|......with a weird twist ending. On the upside it's a short book so it won't take long to get through.
B009ZRY0IC|2.0|The bonus tracks are really what I hoped the entire album sounded like. They were better than all of the other sounds to me.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|family farm I love family farm your farm starts out small and it grows and grows feed the cow clover to get milk buy a bee have to honey put wheat in the windmill you get flour level up to get more items and let your farm grow
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|The game was ok. Pretty average though. It doesn't stand out from the rest of the games of its type.
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|She is just as nice as all the rest, and adds to my collection. I will keep buying more. Thanks.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|We love all the actors and actresses.  We just discovered this series, as well as Cranford.  We love them both.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|What a cute movie -- loved it.  Watched it like three times.  Different side of zombie movie -- a must see.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Everyone was raving, so we thought we'd give it a try.  Got hooked right off the bat. Exhausted all 3 seasons immediately.  Cannot wait for season 4.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love this app! Never had a glitch in over a year. Auto save feature is great. Love the fact that I can start a note on my phone, finish it on my tablet and pull it down from anywhere  on any device!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Everyone was raving, so we thought we'd give it a try.  Got hooked right off the bat. Exhausted all 3 seasons immediately.  Cannot wait for season 4.

B00ESB6GBY|5.0|Great quality of streaming videos and I am loving the season pass. Now every week the show will handily appear on my Roku. I love it!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|If you liked 50 shades of Grey, you will like this. Couldn't put the books down. Waiting for the 4th!
B003G4W49C|4.0|The book is very good, getting better closer to the end.  I'm definitely looking forward to the movie in November 2013!
B004QX07G4|1.0|Elementary school children write better compositions than this banal hodge podge of self gratification. An alternative to reading this abuse of literature is to stick needles in your eyes.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|It had a little of everything. Made you laugh, made you sad, made you feel good inside. Definitely worth the watch. And guys, you won't get bored.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I first read this at age 8 or so, and loved it. Now, at 72, I find it is still absolutely wonderful.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|As with many other people, I'm a little bias in that I feel Dream Theater is certainly one of the most, if not the most, technically proficient bands that has been putting out albums for over 25 years.  I have every one of them including VHS tapes, DVD's, etc....  I was not at all thrilled with the departure of Portnoy and felt I would never go see Dream Theater again.  The first album with Mangini was arguably my least favorite.  Of course, he had huge shoes to fill and was obviously held back a little.  As with most other reviews, this release really impressed me.  I only bought it thanks to looking at reviews and was not at all disappointed.  If I was told it was April Fools and it's actually Portnoy on drums, I'd believe it.  Mangini is very impressive.  There are obviously differences in style and the kit itself has a different \\"ring\\" to it.  But altogether, it's great drumming.  Suffice to say, there is no question about the musicianship of the other three players.  I'm not a huge LaBrie fan, but he sounds pretty strong on this.  I wasn't planning to buy the forthcoming Blu-Ray, but based on listening to this for the past couple of days, I will pre-order it shortly.  I'm sure the drum solo alone will be worth the price of admission.  Not to mention, whatever Petrucci has up his sleeve(s) this time around.  So, for all of you die hards that may have held a grudge towards the band for whatever reason (fact or rumor), drop it and enjoy the album.  It's far better than anything else I've seen come down the pike as of late, including the new Avenged Sevenfold.  There's more double kick in the first couple of tracks then on the complete Hail to the King release.  Enjoy!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|i'm not sure if we are just getting tired of the &#34;dressing for dinner&#34; and opulence but things seem a tad tired, trying to hard, and a touch silly. i still enjoy it but not like first two seasons
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best game ever seen in the entire world because it is free , it's funny, and cool
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|As a big fan of a cappella music, I can watch this movie over and over again.  It has a decent story and a lot of enjoyable a cappella performances that will have you tapping your feet.  It's a nice, light flick to be enjoyed when you want to just sit and chill.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My three year old enjoys playing this game and so do I. It's loads of fun fir the whole family.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|wish I couldngive it more stars but since its on kindle fire I cant do two of the things. the plane and the moose hunting one cause A I cant blow on the plane and B cause I cant cover more than two holes so sorry
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Great cast love the storyline really really enjoyed the entire season. Can't wait for it to start again this season.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app is exactly what ever kindle fire user needs on their device! I was so fed up with having to constantly delete apps because my memory was so low and clean master helped me get back 1.5 Gb within 2 minutes. And what makes it even better is that it's free!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Could not put this book down! It Kept me captivated from start to finish. Swords, blood, guts and brotherhood! A must read! The only problem is waiting for the next in the series.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|The Husbands Secret .. I really liked the plot but not Liane Morartys writing style.  Although this is not her first book, I felt it was a bit immature and lacked depth.  Still a good \\"quick\\" read and will try another of her stories.
B008Y73XTQ|4.0|Seems like very accurate depiction of what it must have been like as German U-boat sailer.  Great acting as suspenseful.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like that this is challenging most games like this are way to easy and I loose interest fast and get bored.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Read this while on a 5 week long trip around southeast asia and i related so much to the characters evolution and journey discovering who she really was.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|Long and Strong.<br /><br />Great if you don't move your monitors around a lot. Once in place, they don't move. Getting them just right is a bit tricky.<br /><br />Much more vertical lift than the stock stands. No chance of tipping over (unless the whole desk gets overturned). Opened up my desk for the addition of 2-3 more square feet of clutter! Awesome!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|awesome this is awesome even my dad did this and likes it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />lol love it so cool awesome so awsome
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|this game is a lot of fun. some clues are easy but some really stump you! it really makes you think sometimes.
B001VU1NJ0|5.0|Seriously, this is good. The mystery and the dynamic characters. Wonderful performances. It's also a beautiful look into the mental process and how it can become damaged or skewed by some outside force. It's tragic and saddening, but still so good.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed a movie without so much cussing in it and I know the troops will enjoy it a lot - even the women.  It was excitement, humor and kept the adrenalin flowing.  Being an older woman made me appreciate it even more as it had message &#34;we may be retired but do not count us down or out and have a lot to offer&#34;.
B00F8L2VO4|1.0|I love this app on my iPhone, but I can't make it connect to my account through Facebook on my Kindle. I really don't want to have to start all over. Please fix this app. Definitely a coding problem. I just get stuck in a loop when I hit login through Facebook. It asks for permission and once granted it just goes back to the original screen.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is Wonderfully written. It Reads fast, and has Well developed characters. Great book for a book club discussion.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|BINGO BLITZ is the most fun and addictive app I've ever played. I play every single day! I love the objectives and the room prizes. It even has slots games!
B00F875N98|4.0|Fun beat sounds even better with headphones. I love the line &#34;Now I'm a mile away and I've got your shoes&#34;
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Fast shipping and product is in excellent condition. I was very happy to receive it so quickly. I love it!
B00EDPFJA4|4.0|Just want to make things clear, I would never consider myself a big Drake fan. Would being from the same city prompt me to support him more? Maybe... Nonetheless, been listening to Drake's records since before his first major release and he keeps getting better with time. Whether it is the selection of beats (a lot would have to do with working so closely with his boy 40), his flow, and his maturity, one can clearly hear it from this album. Nothing Was The Same has great production, well thought out verses, and great collaborations from supporting artists to enhance the whole album.<br /><br />After listening to the album, Drake's latest work exudes confidence that exemplifies and solidifies that he is not just any other rapper or hip-hop artist. In a world full of haters, let's give the man daps he deserves... Overall, the whole body of work was a good listen. Drake is best when his lyrics are honest and real.

B00F91H666|2.0|Having a named star like Brad Pitt expected a interesting and entertaining movie - this movie is too long and not very interesting.  The story line is blurred in the beginning of the movie - and not until sometime into the movie you get the issue that the movie is attempting to state is the world wide problem - a feature that is not fully explained throughout the rest of the long movie.  Best part of the movie was the mention of Camp Humphries - a Army base located in South Korea.  Expected a better movie - but unfortunately for I, this was NOT the movie I anticipated in viewing.

B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Story was of Tarantino(sp) quality, cast was outstanding as was the acting. The bag scene was hilarious, and there was<br />just the right touch of humor in the gunplay. It would be destructive to edit any of the language or gore,so for this reason<br />I would be selective of the audience I would invite to watch. It will become part of my film library.  Ray McAvoy

B00ELE8D4Q|4.0|My top 5 from the Target Deluxe version in order are:<br /><br />1. Favorite Scars (One of the best Cher tracks ever and definitely the best on the album)<br />2. Sirens (Beautifully breathtaking & ethereal vocals)<br />3. Will You Wait For Me (Heartbreaking - It makes me cry)<br />4. My Love (Simply amazing)<br />5. I Walk Alone (Unique musical arrangement, wonderful lyrics and vocals)<br /><br />There are a number of the other songs that I feel have way too many vocal effects going on. There are couple that are so altered it's hard to even tell it's Cher singing on them.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good album with 5 completely stellar tracks, 3 more that are very good and the remainder that are just alright. Not Cher's best album (that will forever be It's A Man's World in my opinion) but a strong return nonetheless.
B007V4QLY2|2.0|With all of Pink's great body of work, this is probably her flattest CD of the bunch. Few hits. Tepid, non-stand out songs that just don't hold up to the greatness in her other work. Love Pink, and people seem to like this one, but it definitely stays on the shelf way more than her other CDs for me.

His word flow is amazing and keeps his readers wanting more.<br /><br />In the Revenge of the Orgasm, I was not surprised with how far GPA took his love for poetry. Poems that told stories, poems that made any woman or man do a double take; GPA has a way of getting his point across plain and simple while forcing readers to read between the lines.<br /><br />For those who have a love for poetry, this book is for you but, even if you are not a reader of poetry, this book will have anyone, man or woman, turned on by the heat that comes off this book. Great job GPA. Keep the “orgasms” coming.”

B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|The book begins with his experience accepting Christ then discovering something that made him feel like he bought into a sale's pitch. He then returned to being Muslim. So really this is a Muslim writing about a widely held Christian topic and pretty much saying Christians are ill educated on the truth about their own religion and the following chapters express reasons why he believes that. This isn't an open minded read if you are Christian. This book was written to ultimately disclaim Jesus as Christ. Aslan has started a trend of thinking I believe will be the Great Lie Revelations foretells, that Jesus is just a man, a mere Jew who died an unfortunate death for his beliefs. If you want a more complete picture of Jesus, please read books by actual New Testament scholars. Aslan is not one. I also advise you to pick up a Bible, go to church and make your own conclusions.

B00DURHYWC|4.0|Was eagerly awaiting this new release, and am very pleased to hear the results. Love all the Martini releases, but &#34;Get Happy&#34; is quite consistent in the quality of its material. Elegant, sophisticated, charming- a lovely work full of passion and spirited interaction. A few short points:<br /><br />The vocals of Storm Lange are simply stunning:  her takes on Quizas, Quizas, Quizas and Pana cand nu the iubeam are at turns smoldering, heartbreaking, and mesmerizing. Wow. Goosebumps galore.<br /><br />Fantastic sound:  expertly engineered and crafted- a beautiful listening experience.<br /><br />Enjoy Pink Martini?  I can't imagine being disappointed- highly recommended.
159420411X|2.0|I fail to understand why so many people seem to love this book. I suppose that as a first encounter with forecasting and probability, this book seems to explain it all. (Which means hardly anyone knows probability/forecasting, which probably is true.) There are several good examples in the book, but that is pretty much it. There is no insight in the book unless it is your first encounter. Since the book is such an easy reading you are likely to come away thinking that the book was great and that you learnt a lot.<br /><br />Personally, I don't like the authors tone of writing. He is expressing himself as an expert in anything. He comes in with his helicopter perspective and tells what is right and wrong and then flies to the next location. I could accept this if the author was 50 years old and had 25 years of astonishing forecasts.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Old school Trekkie here. I have the original movie collection on VHS I ordered from Amazon 15 years ago before Blu Ray. Now I have a Blu Ray player and a wicked 5.1 surround sound. It's the whole movie experience you get with Blu Ray that makes this a must have collection for the real Trekkie. If you want to upgrade your VHS or don't own the original movie collection this is a must for the real Trekkie.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|After reading The Name of the Wind, i found this book more enjoyable than the first. The story is well developed. The main character is flawed in a consistant manner that goes a long way to helping the reader identify with his perils, losses and triumphs. The world is large and enough time is spent on travel to lend to the sense of adventure and exploration you get from reading it.<br />  IMO however, not enough time or effort is spend on description, especially towards developing the characters. Two books later and all i can tell you about the female lead is she has an oval face, dark hair, dark eyes and sometimes pale or tan skin. Could be anyone. How about curving, pouting lips, petite or pointy nose, almond shaped eyes, crosseyed, crooked eyebrows, something, anything really that might distinguish one female charater from any of the others in the book. nothing.<br /><br />  I get he is trying to paint the female lead as a free spirit like the male leads origonal familey but events in the book paint a different picture. I was left with a female lead looking for status and flings everywhere but with him. I was left feeling that he was one of those \\"great friend but nothing to take home to mom\\" types when considering the relationship between the two leads. She doesnt have any problem holding hands, kissing, hugging, being close to dozens of men except him.<br /><br />  I am left with the impression he is the red headed step child next door who sits at the window watching while she dates every one ELSE in the neibhorhood. Wishing it could be him.<br />  Toss in his sexual triumphs in the second book the relationship between the leads rings hollow and false. He can throw down a goddess on her back, has women knocking on his door but he is afriad to touch her the way she lets everyone else in the book touch her yet still pines away about wanting and waiting for her as she continues to bounce from guy to guy.<br /><br />  So much is wrapped around these two charatcersthat alot depnds on their relationship i feel is just not there with any meat so far. Unless like start wars he find out she is his sister in the third book.<br />  The story is great. The writing is good. The male lead is too sappy to be believable after having a go with a goddess and the female lead comes off like a gold digger who looks to him like an infatuated red headed step child she is nice to but wants nothing to do with.<br /><br />  Again i liked the story itself alot. I loved the tons of mini stories told within the main story and how they all come together. Plenty of adventure. Certainly one of the best and origonal stories i have read in a long time. Just a little dissapointed about the characters feeling a little flat and unrememorable. And while the relationships between the male characters i think are well done, the relationships between male and female characters seem to leave me with \\"all women are whores\\" and \\"All men have meaning and purpose\\" be it good or bad.<br /><br />  Think about it after reading both books. Think about the women in the stories. Outside of the goddess not a single one of them so far couldnt be killed off without affecting the story one bit. Not a one of them is important enough to warrent spending any amount of effort remembering, not that you have anything to remember anyway from one to the next but the most basic descriptions. Light or dark hair, dark or light or blue eyes, tan or pale skin. I just described almost all of the women in the two books. Accomplished women? The only thing any of the women accomplish in the story is seducing a lord, king or lead male role after two books. The female lead doesnt even acomplish that much.<br /><br /> Loved the story, didnt care for the way the significant women in the story were portrayed. Left with the feeling they are only considered for having babies, raising kids and sex and a back drop for a book to appeal to a wider market to increase sales.<br /><br />  Strongly suggest taking input from someone interested in women before releasing the next book. Unless of coarse we are going to find out the female lead is his sister.

0800141660|5.0|\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is good adaptation of one of Jane Austen's most beloved novels. Jane Austen always found a way to create the most impossible situations imaginable to push her characters to the limit. This is the story of Marianne (Kate Winslet) and Elinor (Emma Thompson) and their unlucky situation in life. Due to their father dying they are virtually left homeless except for a small amount of money to live on each year. The story begins with a dramatic deathbed wish and you just know things are not going to work out for the best immediately. What surprised me was how funny this movie is when at times it is a near tragedy. Also the English countryside is so beautiful and there are a couple scenes in the amazing family library. Throughout this movie you will be on the edge of your seat wondering what could go wrong next. There are so many twists and turns in the story that it makes the movie absolutely fascinating. The men in this movie are also very interesting. They range from flaky to extremely chivalrous. Some of them also seem more swayed by money than love. Marianne and Elinor also must endure extreme emotional distress before they get what they want. But in the end you could not wish for a better conclusion.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

B007XELMO4|4.0|This thing comes with a couple of accessories that I don't ever use.  And for what it is in materials and design, I don't think the price is fair.<br /><br />That said - its worth it.  I used this in the yellowstone and grand teton backcountry for over 50 miles and it kept my APS-C DSLR easily within reach and at the ready.  As the camera was facing down and I have a lens hood, I left my lens cap off.  So if a vista piqued my interest or a snake scurried across my path I could quickly snap off a few photos without slowing down my hiking companion.<br /><br />And when my hiking companion almost walked into a bear, I had my camera out of the holster fast enough to get off a few shots before the bear disappeared back into the woods.<br /><br />Never had a problem with the camera coming loose, but I left the neck strap over my neck just in case.

B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I waited for this sequel with anticipation. I was looking forward to revisiting Firestarter's Charley first- perhaps she will be next on King's to-do list.<br /><br />I know, I know. It’s Stephen King, right? If he writes about the Wizard of Oz, the Cowardly Lion would eat munchkins. But Dr. Sleep’s Dan Torrance isn’t good at coping with the shining as an adult, as a fact, he runs from it at every opportunity. We all know people like Dan; folks which choose a bottle over living life; moving from place to place; sleeping rough because they are out of money. Stealing! King makes no apology for creating an unlikeable hero for us to reacquaint ourselves.<br /><br />This is after his ordeal at the Overlook Hotel. As an eight-year old child, young Danny is told by his mentor Dave, a gruesome story of sexual and physical abuse as a way to harden the child for the ugly spirits which they both can see. Dan only seems to see the uglies, too. No sweet spirit grandma come to embrace us and say goodbye. He tells us that he has helped others ease their passing however we don't see this. Dan is running from his gift. He doesn’t recognize he is the most powerful monster in the room.<br /><br />Kountz’s Odd Thomas has friends, a solid income and a mission. Certainly, Odd has his ugly scary spirits as well but he stands astride the barriers of this world and the next with confidence. Odd is genuinely likeable. Dan is a train-wreck. The spirits he sees are out to get him, torment him and drive him to the brink of insanity. He has mastery over them but chooses to hide. Jack Sawyer,  the adult version of ‘The Talisman’ is another solid King character. We revisit him in “The Black House” and he is the model of success. Rich and famous ex-detective/author who everyone looks up to. For whatever reason, King opted to strike-out his memory of the adventure which defined him in ‘The Talisman’. This is an odd choice as for Jack, he survived hellish experiences and saved the day as a teenage youth. Why would he block this out? For whatever reason, Dan Torrance isn’t afforded the luxury of blocking his childhood memories by King. As a five-year old, he would be the helpless victim who needs to be saved. His demons are here to stay, they define him not unlike a mental illness or other disability. If anyone deserves time in supervised care, it’s young Dan.<br /><br />I have a rule, never read a King novel before bed. ‘Dr. Sleep’ is no exception.  I don’t want King’s demons visiting me.he day as a teenage youth. Why would he block this out? For whatever reason, Dan Torrance isn’t afforded the luxury of blocking his childhood memories by King.

B00F35BV64|3.0|The story line for the new Star Trek travels back to a time where we meet the character Khan seemingly for the first time. Khan, of course, was the character played by Ricardo Montalban in the tv episode and in the movie &#34;Wrath of Khan.&#34; It's an interesting development and apparently the writers have implied this occurs on a separate time/space continuum since the young Spock confers with the older Spock about how to deal with Khan.My own feeling is there should be completely new adversaries developed for the Enterprise crew to deal with. As far as action and special effects, this movie lives up to the previous movies, but it is fairly predictable.
030758836X|3.0|So many reviewers call this a 'good book' with no explanation. What really does that mean? Was it good because it provided them with an escape, or because they are fans of sensationalist journalism in the modern day media? This book is for people who stuck to the television during the Lacy Peterson investigation and trial. It tricks the reader into thinking they are smarter than they actually are.<br /><br />I finished this book in record time because, although I hated every single character and found them miserable and not worth of any empathy or second thought, I got wrapped up in the manipulation. I also hoped it would get better and was completely let down by the ending. The author does an expert job of exposing shattered relationships and broken people who are too closely bound to live without each other. I've not read a book where one can get so deeply into the skin and brain of the characters. It was so vivid at times that it made me physically sick, not because of gore but because of the raw emotion displayed. I am giving the book three stars for making me nauseated but this is not a book that anyone really needs to read.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Dr. Sleep is my favorite book after The Stand. I downloaded it two days ago and could not put it down. Loved seeing how Danny Torrance grew up. Thank you Stephen King!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Do not read this novel before going to bed; I did and it had a profound impact on my dreams for the next few days. Once I started this book, I could not put it down; the story is extremely compelling and Gaiman does an excellent job of making you feel that you are part of the story. As for the plot; I'm not going to provide any spoilers - go read the book!

B00F5FBE82|5.0|This album has classic Drake overtones but his style is constantly evolving and after hearing some of the songs you only want to listen to them again to capture the rhythmic flow only Drake can deliver.<br />Drake, again, has matched unique beats and rhythms with his rap style and he is not afraid to go there in his music creativity. I feel like Drake really gives 110% of his creative side in his music and that drive shines through and keeps me listening.<br /><br />Overall, great album, would highly recommend it.

B00CIVLZ3U|4.0|Another great series begins, crafted well by Brandon Sanderson, who is consistently proving that he is one of the best world-builders, plotters, and fast-paced action writers out there. This is his take on a world gone to hell because of super-powered beings. Absolute power corrupts absolutely, and none of these &#34;Epics&#34; are 'good super-heroes'. All are super-villains.<br /><br />The protagonist of the tale is a young man named David, who has made it his life's mission to kill Steelheart, dictator of Chicago (now Newcago) and an Epic who killed his father. David joins a bunch of scrappy fighters called the Reckoners, who are the only people fighting back against the Epics - even killing a few.<br /><br />Like any Sanderson page turner, this one has non-stop action, punctuated with character building moments that (mostly) strike true. I've heard tell that this is aimed at a Young Adult audience (didn't feel like it when reading it) and that explains some of the jarring, cringe-worthy dialogue in the middle sections that cost it a star on my rating. Or maybe it's just that the protagonist is a hormonal, repressed, 18 year old.<br /><br />I think this is as good an introduction to Sanderson's work as The Emperor's Soul, his Hugo winning novella was, or Legion, another great short read. He is as good if not better at short fiction clearly, as he is at writing door-block sized multi-part fantasy sagas.<br /><br />I'm just very glad he continues to belt books out so steadily - this is the fourth of his works I've read this year if I count the epic conclusion of the Wheel of Time. Must read as a gateway book for newbies, and fans of his earlier work will need no persuasion anyway.

B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Love this series.  Gets your interest after the first show.  Can't for the other seasons to release. Once you start,your hooked.
B00BIQU1K4|5.0|Prog rock at it's best, Steven Wilson has done it again. I find this album to more melodic then some of his previous projects, but that's a good thing IMHO.
0345535421|5.0|I bought this series for my husband. He is not usually a reader but is devouring these books. We both love the HBO series and he says the series and the books are identical but, as with any book, you get more indepth info in the book.<br /><br />Here is the BEWARE: there are TWO sets of these floating around, the ones written after the series started (you can see they say &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; at the top of the cover) and the original that was pre-series. Make sure you get one or the other because they do not match up. In other words, if you get the first two with Game of Thrones on it you will be totally lost if you start book three of the original. I cannot say if they differ in content since I did not get the first set, but I browsed thogh and you will be in a totaly different place. So be sure...one or the other.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game for all ages. Keeps you on your toes and challenges your problem thinking skills. I would definitely recommend this so.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|You cannot give Iron Man or Robert Hunky Jr. any less than 5 stars, I am sorry. The guy is as old as me and looks better than he did 3 decades ago!<br /><br />Unlike most sequels, this franchise gets better with each subsequent film. This one is more fun than the first two. I think since you know all the characters and the world the film has created, they felt they could add more levity this time to the story. Yes Tony still spouts zingers the whole time, Pepper has come into her own and their romance is quirky and cute. The music is all rock and roll, just like the character, and the effects are great, even if a bit unbelievable.<br /><br />If you liked the first two you will love this one. I have not gotten to the bonus features yet but my guess is they will be great. Oh and if you have an HD Kindle splurge and buy the HD version. For a few bucks more you get a way better picture.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Playing for years ,love it,totally hooked,down side screen freezes lots ,not enough time to check your last ball call before game ends,otherwise love this junk.

1594202273|5.0|When Mr. Schlosser initially contacted me several years ago I was skeptical with respect to what his intentions were.  Other stories and articles have been written about the incident at Damascus, AR. To many of us who experienced it on site that night it seemed there was no one who \\"got it right\\".<br /><br />To put to rest any concerns I had I contacted Al Childers after learning he had spoken to Mr. Schlosser.  I have always had the highest regard for Al and his opinions; hence I participated in the project.  After leaving Little Rock AFB we both were transferred to Vandenberg AFB and worked in the same building.<br /><br />I appreciate the integrity of Eric Schlosser who did what any good writer, or investigator, should do.  He collected the facts and reported them, how refreshing is that in this era where so many run off and write, or report, half cocked.  This entire book was researched in more detail than I ever imagined. Although I was there that night Mr. Schlosser reported things I didn't know simply because I didn't have the right or need.<br /><br />I have read several reviews in which the writers refer to the incident at Searcy, AR as being more serious.  I would like to take this opportunity to simply say that while the loss of life is never to be taken lightly, the circumstances between these two accidents were as different as night and day.  Sometimes it seems those writing the reviews forget that the Titan II at Searcy was not on alert meaning it had no warhead.  The Titan II at Damascus was on full alert and armed.  Mr. Schlosser got it right and was not swayed by the loss of life vs. the reason for his book!<br /><br />Several of my fellow airmen who went back on site that night have passed away. I hope we, as a nation, never forget what they did that night while the nation slept, unaware of the risks those men were taking. I hope their families will have an even greater appreciation for what they did to try and save a resource as well as each other's lives.  Finally thank you Eric Schlosser for getting it right and Chuck Wilson for the countless hours he spent with me fact checking.<br /><br />D. Green's lives.  Finally thank you Eric Schlosser for getting it right and Chuck Wilson for the countless hours he spent with me fact checking.<br /><br />D. Green
B003SHDP4K|5.0|I am attacking Angel and Demons next! There is plenty of interesting historical facts and anecdotes which make it very interesting....far better than the movie! Wish I had read the book first though!
B003ODIZL6|3.0|It is very convenient, and it is easy to use. When I can't find the house dictionary all I have to do is pull this application up.

B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This book made me cry hysterically several times. It's quite depressing but what an ease you will gain. Definitely a must-read!!
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Non stop action from start to finish. It will have you on the edge of your seat the whole movie.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|Loved all the series wish they would of made many more. Maybe someday they will think about it. Dr. Who went on forever so why not this?
B00D5CENXA|4.0|I found this book a really easy read and whipped through it. It's the kind of work you can pick up when having to sit and wait somewhere, proving engaging. It made me wonder, 'what would I do?' in a similar situation. There are many types of justice and this book will invoke lots of discussion and opinion.
B00459EZLW|4.0|A good show... only a wish the have a 3 seasons... the ending is not the best.. i want more..
B00BP4ZNFM|4.0|I would rate CLOSE ENCOUNTERS as a five star compared to E.T. But you can't hate a movie like E.T. It's a likeable, loveable movie. It's warm and fuzzy. And it touched the world darnnit!<br /><br />When I first saw this movie as a kid I look back and only remember how scary the government and doctors and how SCARY they were.<br /><br />I recommend this rental on Amazon because it is not the C.G. enhanced version from 2002. (They digitally erased the guns into walkie talkies.)
B00AYB1RGG|1.0|Can't replace Stalone and expect anything good<br />Was not a great movie in the first one. The second was doomed to start

0345803485|4.0|Great book thus far.  Catches my attention within the first couple chapters. I recommend this book to anyone looking for that suspense novel
B008X8QCTO|5.0|I hesitated to get Weird Park based on some pretty mediocre reviews ... until I realized most of them were based on Alawar charging to continue play about a third of the way into the game (the interruption of game is still there but the additional charge has been removed). I've liked other Alawar games (and am a Big Fish fan) so I decided to take a chance as the cost was reasonable to start. I am very happy I took the chance! The quality of the game is quite high, there is a good mix of HO and various puzzles, the story flows and it's very intuitive. It's a long game ... just when I thought I was coming to the end (I found the lost detective), it continued on to an even weirder segment (very Dali-esque visuals). Then when I finally finished THAT part, there is a Bonus Chapter in the menu that I'm still working through! One of the best games I've played on my Kindle HD!
B000PUV1ZI|5.0|Best movie EVER! I can watch this movie over and over again. A true classic that improves with age. #vino
B00B9366VO|5.0|Saw all the good reviews for this documentary but I was skeptical. Thought it would be just musicians rating this so highly because Dave Grohl made it and put himself and some other legendary musicians in it.<br /><br />Well, it was actually a very lovely tribute to the studio and people that helped make a lot of great music. Watch it and learn some music history, and see how Dave is continuing the tradition and helping music technology evolve.
B00867GKIK|5.0|This movie looks GREAT in 3D! It's my favorite movie so far that I have watched in that format. Really shows how 3D should be presented. Will be buying more of these animated 3D movies because they look the best in 3D compared to a non-animated movie.
B00DP3IESY|4.0|I have found that any movie with Morgan Freeman in it is completely worth watching. Oblivion had great special effects and the storyline contained enough twists to keep it interesting. Believability also played a role in my rating but overall it was an interesting movie. Worth the time.
0399226907|5.0|Great all time children's book, sturdy hardcover. It was a great present to add to her book collection. Speedy delivery.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|A story of love, infatuation and friendship. Set in the bayous of the Arkansas delta. With great acting and scenes of the river bayous!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I actually rated this a little high. I would have liked to give it 3.5 stars.<br /><br />This is a fun show if you like the dark side. The production values are quite high and the special effects are first rate. There's not a lot of actual blood (yet) but the bodies of the victims that have been killed in such imaginative ways are done really well.<br />Mads Mickkelson is wonderfully smart, creepy, manipulative and charming. And you just know he's feeding people to his dinner guests.
B0096A9QXC|5.0|This cute little game is Great. My 4 yr old Grandbaby loves this game,and I'll admit that I like it too...
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Very, very surprised at the ending!  Did not see that coming until the last 2 pages!  Enjoyed continuing to follow these characters.  Hurry up for the next book!  Need a review in the front of the book to remind readers of each character since there is some time between books.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I love this game so much! The blobs of pudding are so adorable and its really a good puzzle game. It's kind of confusing at first but as soon as you know what you're doing it's pretty easy.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Well written, loved the characters and could not wait to turn each page.  I felt like I knew some of the characters they were so real.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Mahjong is pretty basic.  The tiles are pretty.  It has quite a few puzzles to play.  The only thing I don't appreciate, is that it keeps popping up with screens for you to buy upgrades.
B003TTKB5I|5.0|AWESOME!!  STARTED WATCHING AROUND SEASON 4 SO WE NEVER SAW THE FIRST FEW SEASONS.  THIS SHOW GRABS YOU FROM THE VERY FIRST EPISODE!!
B00004WS7J|5.0|It was perfect. In flawless condition and arrived with plenty of time to spare. I could not be any happier with it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is so much fun and any age can play. So glad I got this game because it is so entertaining !!!!
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|My 10 year old daughter downloaded this game. She had played it a few times and was playing it sitting on the couch across from me when she tried to close one of the ads at the top of the game it was PORN. Many pictures of explicit sexual acts kept appearing on her kindle. I am outraged!!! A game that is geared toward kids should first of all not have any ads in it & second Amazon has to be able to do something about keeping this filth off of games that a 10 year old or younger or older are on!! I am sick, my daughter is really upset. This should not have happened!
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|I consider both Oryx and Crake and Year of the Flood to be two of the best novels of any genre I've ever read. They create an incredibly rich and perverse world that feels like it could really happen - and that's pretty scary!  MaddAddam does nicely wrap up all the loose ends from the first two books, and I especially liked finding out who Adam 1 was.  But the characters just weren't as interesting, and while some of the adventures those characters had kept me reading, I ultimately felt just a little disappointed, but only because my expectations were so high from the first two books.
B002RSQGQK|4.0|This is one of my all-time favorites. My husband watched it with me for the first time and he loved it, too!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I have read almost all of the DeMille books and found the ending to be quite blah. Books are few and far between for DeMille. I hope he starts writing books again like &#34;The Lion&#34; or Plum Island which cannot be put down.

B00DGGIXS6|5.0|Love it!  I think its her best yet!  If you love Cher you'll love this album!  Good Job!  x  x
B000JCSBU0|5.0|I don't want to give any thing away but if you are looking for a happy ending in a movie don't look at Requiem for a Dream.It is about drug addiction.I thought the movie was well acted.I loved the way it was filmed.Ellen Burstyn ends up addicted to pills.Her son is addicted to heroin as is his girl friend.It is very sad.I think all the actors did a terrific job.I do recommend it if you want to watch a more serious movie about drug addiction.
B00DYWKPAQ|3.0|This is a good album & is exactly what you'd love if you like KOL's last few albums .If you are like me & loved the old gritty stuff more, you'll be a little disappointed.<br />This is just the band they have become.<br /> This is a good polished sounding album with some real good , some good & some boring songs. No longer do you get the pump up party jams like the first few albums.<br />It is still the Kings of Leon & is still good enough to listen to & enjoy , just not an album you'd throw on to get amped up.
B001B2CPH2|4.0|This one you can watch again every couple of years.  Ten more words is a dumb rule.  change it today.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I've played this several times a day for a month or more now ad still enjoy it. Lots of variants on Mahjong screens and a lot of fun. You can't beat the price, either.
B00BSNTYVO|5.0|As I did not have the best history teacher in high school and college, it was a college course for me!  It not only showed some glimpses of what his family life was possibly like, but an in depth study of the congress at that time and the impact of the emancipation proclamation!  His values are my values!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really got a Kindle fire because I wanted to read this series. It was recommended by the host of Science Friday. And it is wonderful for teen readers as well as those who are older.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This is a great little tool for the young and the old. We have twin grandkids in pre-k this year and have become very interested in writing and drawing. They enjoy games on my Kindle so this is perfect for them.  The colors are vivid and it has a lot of tools that they will enjoy using.  The tools are user friendly and should not be any problem for them to master. I feel sure they will really like this.
140006922X|5.0|Excellent book. Nothing really new here. I've heard most of this before. However, he certainly puts it all together in an easily understandable way. His description of the Temple in Jerusalem was so vivid that our study group felt like we were taking a guided tour! It's just packed with history.
B00EY7LT9Q|4.0|Good action in the pilot. Wondering if it will survive, as so many &#34;heros&#34; type TV series just didn't last very long.<br /><br />Visual effects aren't as spectacular as the movies, but it is definitely far better than any of the TV shows of a similar genre.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Just want to say this game keep me up all night. I can't put it down. LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|We have this on every device we own! This is a great game when traveling, interesting enough to keep you playing and love the neck cracking sound
B00DJ80VLS|4.0|There is nothing groundbreaking or different on this release from anything DT has done and that's ok. These cats are still putting out great music that is consistently good.  How many bands that have been together for over twenty years can you say that about?  I'm getting used to them echoing ideas from previous tracks on a chorus or verse and I'm cool with it.  The only tracks I don't care for are \\"Along for the Ride\\" and \\"The Bigger Picture\\".  \\"Surrender to Reason\\" really snuck up on me in a good way, the groove is infectious, and of course the epic \\"Illumination Theory\\" will have any true DT fan salivating - the psychedelic movie background part where Jordan does his thing contrasts perfectly with the manic driving crunch before and after this intermission.<br /><br />I noticed some commenting on the audio and I'd like to add my take.  I think it is a very solid mix, but the kick and snare drum are smidge too loud for me.  Also, the snare sounds like hitting a hollow rock with a sledgehammer - there is no snap to it.  I have not listened to the 5.1 mix yet, but from my experience, these mixes usually sound better, and if this true for this mix, then it will be quite stellar.<br /><br />Overall, a great release that any fan of DT or prog-metal should own.
B00F87A7HG|3.0|I love Kings of Leon and was excited to hear the new album. It's good but doesn't have one of those songs that just &#34;grabs&#34; you. A little disappointed.
0802473156|5.0|I'm not a reader but if your married and just cant get it right this is an inexpensive way to get right. I finished it in less than a week!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My entire family is hooked, plus live the new beach location!!!<br />So much better than temple run and is highly addictive!
B0066NA8CU|5.0|Alicia, the good wife; Peter, the charismatic but unfaithful politician husband; Kalinda, the mysterious kick-ass investigator; Will, the handsome playboy boss--each one interesting, well-developed, and flawed. It's hard to wait for the next episode to see what happens to the people you care about.
B008JFUUIA|4.0|I love love LOVE this movie.  It's one of my new favorites.  The DVD arrived fast, and although it's rental (I'm guessing SOMEONE forgot to return it?), it looks to be in great shape.  I haven't gotten around to watching it just yet, but I will update this review when I do.  Good price, too.
B003Z2LAAO|2.0|It's just a narrated documentary type thing. I didn't even watch the whole thing. The 3D didn't make a difference to me.
B008JFUNYG|5.0|I am a die hard fan of Raimi's original Evil Dead series so I was taken aback when they announced a remake. However, this really isn't comparable to the original as it is a completely serious approach to the original film.<br /><br /> This film is excellent. One of the better horror's to come out in years. Excellent acting, great pace, and done with a respect of the original that will make die hard fan's like me happy without confusing those who have never seen the early films. I look forward to more from Fede Alvarez, the director.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I loved this movie, I really enjoyed Lord of the Rings. The first Hobbit movie and this one are perfect extensions of the L of the R.<br />It explains how it all started the Lord of the Rings. I ordered this one in 3D it is awesome. DVD is still great on it's own.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Even I, a Russian girl living in Spain, can find lots of events and, more important, feelings which I have been experiencing as an immigrant. And my Nigerian boyfriend is eager to read this book as I've been constantly talking about it!
0679809015|5.0|This is our 11 month old daughter's favorite board book now. She loves opening and closing the little flaps and even after being used every day for two weeks, it is holding up well. As some other reviewers mentioned, this is way smaller than other board books we have, but I think it is perfect size for tiny hands.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|A great family story!  The character are a rich blend of real life. Please everyone take the time to watch.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I typically don't have time to write up reviews for the books I've read, but this time I wanted to give my opinion about a book that has (unfairly) received a lot of negative reviews.  I will agree that those looking to read this book in hopes of a Harry Potter-ish type of read are going to be disappointed, as this books focus is much more sociological in nature. However; those familiar with Ms. Rowling's writing style will not be disappointed with this book, as she does a very good job of providing a casual flowing interaction between the characters in the book (much like she did with the characters in the Harry Potter series). Personally, I think being able to create a casual, unforced dialog between characters is one of Ms. Rowling's best gifts as a author.<br /><br />I disagree with the negative reviews that 'The Casual Vacancy' is a very dark and depressing book. Some of the themes in the book may be more adult oriented, but I did not find anything about the book (or hardly anything) to be that dark or depressing. Honestly, this book is an exploration of personal and interpersonal relationships between the central characters in the book after the death of one of the towns most identifiable citizens. The story presents the reader with glimpses into how this death affected each of the characters (either personally or indirectly through other characters) and how this one individual's death had such an effect on this small town. Perhaps the most \\"depressing\\" aspect of this book comes from the fact that you can probably relate with many of the characters, and that the book often strikes close to home on some of its topics.<br /><br />Overall, I applaud Ms. Rowling's first foray into a non-fantasy, non pre-teen fiction novel. I think those looking for a good read should give it a try. I think that if you read the novel without expectations of another Harry Potter, or expectations of some groundbreaking novel that's going to change your life forever, then you should enjoy this book. The book does have some themes that some readers may find uncomfortable...what I'm trying to say I guess is that if you're somebody who is easily offended, you probably should not read this book.<br /><br />I gave this book four stars simply because I couldn't give 4 and a half. I really enjoyed reading 'The Casual Vacancy' and didn't really find anything I outright disliked about the book. I would have appreciated some sort of epilogue at the end of the novel, but I can't necessarily fault Ms. Rowling for not doing that. The only reason I didn't give the book 5 stars is because it wasn't a book that I will read over and over again. To me, to be deserving of a 5 star rating, the book has to really engage me and keep me reading it.  Though I enjoyed reading 'The Casual Vacancy', I was able to set it down as needed and come back to it at my convenience.
B009NH6AOQ|3.0|As I watched the third season over two days, I found myself a bit disinterested in the story lines. The last two seasons were gripping; episode after episode I was left wanting more. I had to find out what happened next. This third season didn't evoke those emotions and I think I can put a finger on why.<br /><br />1) Replacing the zombie threat with The Governor.<br /><br />The past seasons developed characters amidst an oppressive backdrop of persistent threat from zombie attack. That dynamic created tons of tension that story writers and actors used effectively to heighten drama within the group. Now that the main characters we know and love have become veteran apocalypse survivors and zombie hunters, it leaves the feeling that the zombie threat is not ever a big deal and can be easily managed. As this threat subsides, we are introduced to a new and potentially more sinister threat presented by the Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde-like Governor. I think David Morrissey played the Governor well. It's just that the story writers play out the \\"is he good or bad?\\" drama far too long. Despite imbuing him with some disturbing character traits, I really think they held back on how dark they portrayed the Governor. The overall effect leaves the audience without a competent replacement for all the tension we had from the zombie threat in previous seasons.<br /><br />Combine this shift in focus with numerous scenes where the viewer is left to believe some character is doomed to be devoured by an overpowering horde of zombies, only to find out later that they somehow got away unscathed really undermines the survival tension. It's a simple, tried and true formula: zombies are slow, but persistent, insatiable, and have a massive numerical advantage. They slowly surround, trap and eventually infect or eat everything. Once this claustrophobic dynamic is gone, it leaves a huge void.<br /><br />2) Introduction of new characters, loss of old ones, old characters getting larger roles.<br /><br />The new actors/actresses are merely ok. I already said I liked David Morrissey as the Governor, but I felt they held back on how dark they let his character get. Maybe they're saving his truly dark side for next season. Danai Gurira as Michonne was likeable. Her character is a cool addition. I thought it would come off as too comic-book silly, but I think her preference for the samurai sword worked. What didn't work was her over-exaggerated facial expressions. No subtlety there, and likely because she doesn't get to talk much. She started to open up at the end so hopefully we won't need similar facial cues to convey her emotions in future seasons. I really didn't like how the new prison characters played out. They really felt like cannon fodder that served as story line filler. Once the last of the prisoners were killed off, I felt like all those developments were a waste a time. It wasn't used effectively to advance character development for anyone else and it didn't feel significant to the overall story at all. Like I said, filler. I never felt like I was watching filler in the first two seasons. Tyreese and Sasha look like strong new characters that I want to watch, but they had small roles this season and it is unclear how prominent they will be featured in future seasons.<br /><br />I have no problem with killing off main characters. I think it has worked well for the Game of Thrones series. Unfortunately for Walking Dead Season 3, some of the old characters that were killed off were very strong characters that delivered emotional and believable performances. They really added something to this series and I'm afraid the new characters don't do a good job of filling their shoes.<br /><br />Some old characters have more prominent roles, and quite frankly they're not that good. Characters Glenn and Maggie are pretty weak, but they get plenty of screen time. Delving into Rick Grimes psychological instability was flat-out boring, and a real momentum killer. I hate to say it, but Carl Grimes is annoying... though his future story line looks promising.<br /><br />3) The third season went out with a literal bang and a figurative pop.<br /><br />Season one and two left us hanging on a climax. Season 3's climax was predictable. At the end, the main group of survivors was left in a relatively comfortable, stable state. That really threw me off. I popped in the very last bluray looking for maybe one more episode, but it only contained extras. I always buy the whole seasons when released so that means I wait an entire year between seasons. The first two season's were so gripping, and left me in such an emotionally heightened state, I new I would be all over the next season. This time, season 4 isn't really on my mind. I'm not anticipating what's next. I'm not worried about the group; they'll be fine.<br /><br />I'm a big zombie fan and I still love the series, though this review seems negative. I'm still committed to season 4, and I don't recommend that fans give up on the series. Season 3 is decent, it just was a drop from previous seasons. On the other hand, if season 4 comes around and can't deliver like season 1 and 2, then I might abandon ship.
B00EP0KBXM|4.0|I thought this was a great story, and the acting was great. Jaden did a great job acting and so did Zoe. Of course Will did, as always. The effects were great, too. So I am totally perplexed at why this hasn't consistently gotten excellent reviews. What the heck's not to like? It's got great acting, love and strength and aliens and hardship and survival struggle and eye candy. What more do you want? My favorite kind of movie is sci fi so I am pretty critical, and I liked this. Make a sequel!!!!
1419702238|4.0|kids love it and makes a great addition to their collection of these books they have enjoyed since they came out
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Hey, there are lots of things I should do with my spare time - but, this fun game gets my attention from time to time - so glad I have it.  Sometimes in life one feels like being &#34;An Angry Bird :)&#34;
B00DJ80VLS|3.0|After being hugely disappointed with the last album, A Dramatic Turn of Events, I had low expectations for this album. However, the band has bounced back...somewhat. Still one of the lingering problems I find on this as well as the former cd is the lack of dynamics. Theres just no punch to the sound like all albums from BCASL and before. The second problem is James consistently stays in his safe range of vocals. I get that he is getting older but no ones expecting him to sound like he did in the 90's but show some damn emotion. The exception to this is Illumination Theory which is their big epic track on an album full of mostly shorter songs for a change. James sounds exceptional here....but why just for one song. Illumination Theory is not a perfect epic as it feels disjointed and the middle orchestral section didn't do much for me but it is a solid song and James truly does carry the song. The other great part about this CD is we get two instrumentals (which if James is going to sing in his safe range for most of the album, I am all for the instrumentals), False Awakening Suite is a fine opener and features more orchestration (the dynamics shine on this song for a change) and Enigma Machine which showcases drummer Mike Mangini's awesome drum skills as well as John Myungs bass skills. Out of the rest of the songs, the only one I really cared for was Along For The Ride. A few shining moments on this CD and I hope they can get their sound back soon.
B00821OX98|4.0|Well performed, but a bit too much of an old story line. We've seen aliens killing humans in virtually all sci-fi since the 1950s.
B00DG86ARK|4.0|Here we have the 4th concert film by Anathema (Visions Of A Dying Embrace, Were You There?, and A Moment In Time). While technically this is a great blu-ray, the band is not offering us much new on their concert films. The setlists for the last three dvds were almost the same. A Moment In Time offered us rare tracks in the bonus features section such as A Dying Kiss, Sleepless and Albatross. This concert film is by no means bad, in fact, its awesome but it just falls into the same-old same-old category. A few things that could have made this better would have been a 5.1 surround sound option (would have worked well on the wall-of-distortion tracks like Thin AIr), the promo videos for Dreaming LIght and as awful as it was Untouchable. Overall, not a bad blu ray and I would rate it 3.5 stars....just hope for the next one, they offer us something a bit different.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|I personally think that This is one of Van Damme's best actual &#34;Acting&#34; in a long time!! I Think Expendables 1 was much better however.
B007IFZU5A|5.0|Paradise Lost have been on a wide variety of paths in the last 25 years from doom metal (Gothic), traditional metal (Draconian Times), electronica-rock (One Second), straight up electronica (Host) to rock (Believe In Nothing) and then back to metal again. However starting with their self titled album from 2005, the band has been trying to recreate the sounds of the past but each album failed for different reasons. The self titled album was very vanilla sounding, In Requiem had good ideas but sounded forced and FDUDUU seemed disjointed...heavy as hell but disjointed. Finally the band returns to their true sound with Tragic Idol. Apart from the opening track Solitary One which sounds like a leftover from FDUDUU, every track here is solid. Maybe going on tour for their Draconian Times shows paid off because the band nailed the late 90s sound while adding a few new elements such as the thrash classic \\"Theories From Another World\\". All the elements are there for their entire past. \\"Fear Of Impending Hell\\" has some nice use of acoustic guitar while still remaining heavy, the title track is comparable to \\"Say Just Words\\" in catchiness, \\"The Glorious End\\" is like a big brother to Draconian Times \\"Jaded\\", we even get some doom metal in one of the tracks. By far, this is the bands best CD at least since 2004's Symbol Of Life. Highly recommended!
B005544TRQ|5.0|it's funny and also smart.  my wife and i both love it.  we're catching up on the last seasons now.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|it will not work with my printer,  I guess it would best described as less than worthless or just plain useless
B00EJ2WBX4|5.0|A solid album the whole way through. I've been listening to this on repeat for a couple days now and none of the songs have gotten annoying or any less enjoyable to listen to than the first time I heard them.
B009LQKHIO|3.0|The storyline was great. It lacked enough character development for me. They almost seem two dimensional. The errors were very distracting as well.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I love Spanish and it was so hard in highschool but I learned so much in Spain and wanted to continue learning and this app is awesome<br />and not just for spanish
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this is so awesome I this app you aren't limited to u imagination and it is so fun it was definitely worth my money people think it is for geeks but if u have played I am sure u loved!!! THIS IS AN AMAZING APP I PROMISE!!!!
B008FTAAG2|5.0|this cd is worth more than the $6 for sure i love it it is emotional and she is a great singer reminds me a little bit like lacuna coil
B007D15NE2|3.0|Coraline is so simple to read and would really be a great read for children. It is easy to understand and is also entertaining for adults.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Excellent read. It makes you examine your life and feel grateful for everything you have, like your sight and ability to breath and walk on two legs!
B00755MHXG|5.0|It is amazing because this book not only makes you questions yourself but it also makes you question those around you. It is a book which gets to the heart of bullying and identity. It really makes you think about the saying &#34;it's not about how you look but it's the personality that matters&#34;. I mean, how many of us really believe that? Well this book challenges that in amazing ways!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I loved this book's complicated structure--flashbacks within flashbacks and differing versions of the same events gave the novel mystery and tension. The story, to me, is one of love triumphing over hate, good over evil. But the glimpse into the twisted society of North Korea is so horrifying that several times I was tempted to put the book away. It's not an easy read, and i had to give it 50 pages or so to draw me in, but I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys serious artistry in fiction.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|It's good love the led pen I can write bad wolf on things and keep it a secret EHEHEHHEHEHEHIM hi
0743290933|5.0|This is a book that serious novel writers should have in their libraries.  It's written by Noah Lukeman, who is not only a top-tier agent, but a notable author in his own right.  He shares his insider knowledge of the novel publishing business, and much of his insights and advice are invaluable.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Best &#34;zombie&#34; movie ever made. I was not expecting this movie to be good but it ended up being great! You do feel for the characters and want things to end well...maybe they do...maybe they don't :)
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Just finished this amazing read.  I've heard several people mention &#34;Born to Run&#34; and now I know why!  It's an amazing story (and numerous side stories) brimming with good humor and good information, all wrapped up in my favorite sport; running.  I burst out laughing many times (especially at Barefoot Ted's antics on race day), enjoyed the intellectual and scientific pursuits of the Running Man, and thoroughly enjoyed an all-around good tale.<br />I highly recommend this to anyone with any appreciation for running.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|The illusions are awesome but the story line was not believable enough. Worth watching just for the magic. I would recommend.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Really fast paced and holds your attention. Reminds me of a non-stop angry birds type game. A good way to waste time.
B00F35BV64|5.0|It's funny, I never watched the TV show but I have seen every movie. They are all excellent including this one!
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Its hard to find good sci fi movies these days. this one was pretty good. would make an interesting tv series maybe.
030745455X|5.0|This is a great read.  You will want to read the whole series though.  Start with The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and end with The Girl who Kicked the Hornets Nest.  The girl that Played with Fire is in the middle.  You might enjoy the movies as well.  The Swedish version with English subtitles and the Hollywood version.  I did not see the Hollywood version.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A fascinating, different sort of story.  Couldn't put it down.  Characters well portrayed.  Plot unusual and unexpected.  A story that could be real.
1451668945|5.0|got the book, read it and it arrived in good condition and in the time frame it was supposed to.
B0013F1D02|5.0|This movie was a wonderful escape into an enchanting fantasy for a couple of hours.  I enjoyed it and absolutely love a feel-good-happy-ending!  This would be appropriate for any age.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I've been using this mouse daily for about two months now I really like it.  I have been using Razer branded gaming mice for many years now and while I've always liked the accuracy, sensitivity adjustments, and clean button feel Razer mice have, they've always been slightly problematic. They always seem to have minor issues which don't ruin the product but are slightly annoying. For instance every Razer mouse I've ever owned has had a problem where it would sometimes not light up or function when the computer was booted, and would need to be unplugged and plugged back in. They also seem to break or wear out fairly easily and are very expensive to replace. Also the new Razer Synapse drivers cloud save thing is super annoying and really slows down windows a lot at launch and can't really be deactivated if you want to change profiles on the mouse. I've even had Razer mice cause blue screens and crashes on both pc and mac, which I was able to track down to the mouse drivers based on stack traces.<br /><br />I decided to try this Anker Mouse to replace my Razer Imperator when it broke. The Anker mouse is $33 less (currently) and honestly feel it is a better product. It has the same sensitivity adjustments, clean button click feel, high accuracy I've come to expect and I feel like it's ergonomics  are more comfortable for my hand. Also the LED lighting is fully RGB customizable which is a nice perk. And I've never had a single issue with the driver, or the mouse not being detected.<br /><br />The only caveat is that while the mouse functions perfectly on a Mac, the configuration software is not available. If you want to redefine buttons, change the sensitivity levels presets, or change the colors of the LEDs you have to do so with the software on a PC.  The mouse will remember the changes when connected to different computer though, making it an effective workaround!
0689815816|5.0|This is a great book and it was in perfect condition. It was shipped very quickly.  My daughter is delighted!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Seen better Z movies, wouldn't buy it to watch again, wouldn't recommend it not the book or the movie thumbs down
B003NX75B8|5.0|Another wonderful book that really relates to the times. A must read for any one young person going through struggles or an identity crisis. Great story of overcoming challenges and the importance of friendship.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this the best because it has the minions in the lab and city.  play it its awesome game and I really love it
B00F35BV64|5.0|As a StarTrek fan I found the movie fantastic....!!!! Amazon video played wonderfully .....<br /><br />loved how they rebooted the legend of Khan!
B008D28HYS|5.0|I found CrossMe regular and CrossMe color a year or two ago and got hooked right away.  I was bummed that the paid version was so expensive.  Since this is the FAotD I'm all over this.<br /><br />This game is really neat because it's all logic.  However, it's sometimes hard to find the logic on the complicated puzzles.  If you like things like Sudoku, you'll like this game.  Definitely pick it up.
B00CIFK316|1.0|I did not Llke this presentation..<br />COLD...COLD......COLD<br />  I DONOT HAVE 10 MORE PRINTABLE WORDS TO USE HERE. 20 word rule sucks
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I enjoy fantasy and its heavy reliance on action and plot.  What really makes Blood Song exceptional, is its excellent character development and focus on relationships; especially in the first 2/3 of the book.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Great game once you get basics down its so much fun. Patients is really the key also the tutorial was a big help
0743297334|4.0|I like this book, especially since we were in Pamplona, Spain last year and walked the same streets Hemingway walked.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Good but it won't work on my kindle but I love this app but idk on my kindle it says this is taking longer than it should pleaser try again later
0062511408|5.0|This is a lovely book, very entertaining and easy to read.  The adventures of all the characters really hold my interest.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Season 1 was better I think but still one of  my favorite shows! I'm anxious to see what season 3 brings!
0385721234|5.0|I ordered this book for my library, but I haven't read it yet.  I didn't read the English version or see the movie, so it will be all new.
B00CKURWTK|5.0|We had a copy of the first book, Underwater Dogs and everyone, adults and children lived it.  We got a couple copies of Kids Edition for our niece and nephews.  They all thought it was VERY cool and funny.  I also like that it describes all the breeds on the back which adds a little educational component to something so fun.
8497597931|4.0|It's a great and classic book.  Last year we were in Pamplona, Spain and saw the places Hemingway describes in the book.  It was great to walk the streets he walked and go in the cafes and bars he frequented.
B00AQ71FLK|2.0|I like the game but for all the gameloft games ive been playing when the order and chaos update came I've not been able to log into my accounts plz fix this
B00F87A7HG|3.0|Not quite yet.  I'm in the camp that prefers the first three albums-- found the HIGHLIGHTS of the 4th album to be fantastic (\\"Closer, Crawl, Sex, Revelry\\")-- thought \\"Use Somebody\\" was weak sauce and found the 5th album to be totally forgettable.  This album, as an album on the whole, is the most enjoyable and consistent since their 3rd album, but not as varied and assured and hungry as that album.  Certainly I will give this album a pass, and, have enjoyed listening to it.<br /><br />The opening 4 tracks are fun and tasty, and although it starts to hit that sag point that marred their 4th album, this time around the middle stays buoyant and interesting-- with tracks that do their, now standard, old U2/contemporary U2 thing quite well and tunefully, with plenty of nice sounds, guitar bits and noodles and pauses for textural breaks that give life and taste to this middle section.  Though the album sort of stays in this zone through on to the end, it never gets boring and keeps your feet moving.  Another reviewer wrote that this wasn't a \\"party\\" album but a little more of a \\"road trip\\" album-- and I will agree.  I \\"walk and rock\\" when I break in a new album-- and this one certainly kept me plugged in and wandering the neighborhood.  Because Of The Times was the best between their perceived \\"rowdier past\\" and their, of late, more meandering and lifting sides-- and this one strikes sort of a safe and comfortable follow-up to that album-- but of course, without the electricity and daring that made the balance of Because Of The Times such a great total work.  Only By The Night frustrated because it seemed to offer up some daring and new turns while at the next corner strolling dully down unadventure lane.  This album keeps both the energy and broadness in safe balance-- keeping a fan like me pleased while bringing back some of those \\"Use Somebody,\\" \\"Sex On Fire\\" new fans.  Whatever the hell Come Around Sundown was trying to do was lost on me.  Totally tired and grasping.Probably should've canned that one.  I'm guessing it had something to do with this album being called \\"Mechanical Bull.\\"<br /><br />Now the name dropping...  So, not that they care, but KoL and I are cool again-- not because of the \\"names,\\" but, because they made some non-tired tunes.  Glad they sound to be enjoying their job.  And, as promised, some names.  Feel free to agree or disagree/add to these-- I'd like to hear it.  \\"Rock City\\" has a \\"Last Dance With Mary Jane/Tom Petty\\" vibe, and by proxy, a bit of early Dylan swagger and tumble in the vocal delivery (\\"I Shall Be Free, 115th Dream,\\" etc).  \\"Don't Matter\\" is pretty straight up KoL, and, I could here QOTSA drub this out with bemused abandon.  (By the way, their latest is effing great.)  \\"Temple\\" has an initial Petty vibe, but then just gets all KoL.  Interestingly, KoL contemporaries The Strokes seem to be capable of /some/ of these tunes I was thinking while listening to this album-- something KoL have long been chased with.  And so what, another of the \\"nu garage\\" bands that gave NME, etc. huge bananas back in the heady days of 2K or so.  Anyway, although I find the lyric to \\"Temple\\" a bit, I dunno, uncomfy or whatever, it's another pleasing enough tune.  \\"Family Tree\\" had me slightly ZZ Top \\"La Grange\\" mixed with a bit of T.Rex \\"Crimson Moon.\\"  A couple of other riffs and noodles perk the ears up a bit with recognition but... whatever.  Another reviewer wrote that \\"Coming Back Again\\" was a bit too samey, and I'll have to agree, but I don't think it's bad, it just doesn't have much to offer the album at that point.  I, like a loyal music customer slave, purchased the deluxe version.  Marketing often hides a worthy enough little morsel to get that extra buck, and, in my opinion, to test, tempt and torture the \\"true\\" fan.  But, I'm the one that bought it, right?  Anyway, \\"Work On Me\\" may have not fit the album, but it is a really refreshing track.  Has a bit of a Cure \\"Six Different Ways\\" quality via the South African/Southern US vibe.  \\"Last Mile Home\\" didn't impress much but grew more endearing with the childhood sentiment/good adult tag line of \\"dreaming on the last mile home.\\"  Anyway, walk a mile in their shoes, and keep their shoes.<br /><br />This ain't their last bar room rodeo.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It feels like the most amazing game you could play in all history.<br />It feels like eating the best ravioli in the world
B0046ECFRM|4.0|This is one of those indulgent books that you just want to read because it's easy and fun.  I loved it.  I thought the writing was great, it made me laugh out loud.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|My son love this app. He doesnt allows me to use my kindle anymore. So, It's a great app. Excellent
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This movie has it all, a bit &#34;hollywood&#34; but the bottom line is that it is VERY entertaining and fun to watch.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|For a while there I stopped reading Grisham altogether because I found no satisfaction in just reading a 'best selling author'.  However, I have really enjoyed the last couple of offerings from him.  This plot keeps you guessing with many twists and turns and makes you wonder at the 'justice' in today's judicial system.
B004TN7QPG|5.0|this program is very customizable and i just like the way it works. it is very user friendly and the learning curve is low.
B0018TLRTK|5.0|This is one of Billys' best albums he has out. It covers songs that were and still are very popular. A lot of the songs on here are not on some of his other albums. It is a feel good album that brings back memories of some of the best Idol songs from the 80s and 90s.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|The men of Operation Redwing are true American heroes who deserve to be remembered.  Marcus Luttrell did a great telling their story.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning more about the War on Terror as it is being fought in Afghanistan and the brave Americans fighting in it.  Semper Fi Marcus
B00116FT6M|3.0|This movie was really nicely done, although there were parts that were too forgettable. The storyline didn't seem to build properly and moved forward too quickly while not supporting enough.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|I highly can recommend this book. Entertaining and extraordinary. And yes i discovered 15 things nobody told me! Just read it and you will love it
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Very well done with excellent acting by all...so cool to see the actual musicians playing in the movie!  A special movie.
B0000046W9|5.0|Stan Getz is my favorate smooth jazz horn player this album is great listen to it very much ok ok!
B00DOPEGAS|5.0|Many of her friends have one and they love it...there is no exception here...this bracelet maker is fantastic. Very happy with this purchase. The seller was also polite and courteous when we had a question.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Way to much being introduced and still no word on blind Arya???  I really did not care for book 4 much but 5 even less.  The first 3 books I could not put down.
B005QMOZOO|3.0|Not bad, tied up some ends regartding the family's of Pride and Prejudice.  Nice to read on a long journey.
1476727651|3.0|The good news is that this was a book I couldn't put down, even after the hand cramps started from holding the Kindle for so long.  The bad news is if you want to read a book that will scare the actual sleep from you, you're best off reading Neil Gaiman's \\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane.\\"<br /><br />\\"Doctor Sleep\\" is not a bad book.  It's actually one of King's better books, but ranks below his most recent works \\"Joyland\\" and \\"11/22/63.\\"<br /><br />The books fails in an area that you would not expect from King.  It's not long enough.  The most interesting part of the book is the beginning.  The scariest part of the book is the beginning.  Danny's early days following what happened at the Overlook are far more interesting than anything else and the least developed.  How does one survive something as horrifying as what happened to the young Danny?<br /><br />It was King himself, I believe, who once said that a book is only as good as its villain.  And while the concept of psychic vampires is interesting, the characters themselves are rather weak and hamstrung quite easily.<br /><br />How was the True Knot formed?  Who are these people?  Who was Rose?  How did she come to be?  Where is her origin story?  We are treated in the beginning to the origin story of one the members and then that character is barely seen for the rest of the book.<br /><br />Again, this was not a bad book.  If it were not by King, I might have rated it higher, but I've come to expect more from him.  In the end he didn't let down Danny completely, but he could have done better by him.
B002DEZXOE|5.0|There really are no words that come close to conveying the importance of this film. It represents an era in history unlike any other. I was in my mid 20's during that era and there are just no words to describe the feelings of Love, joy, optimism -- no, words can't come close. To have been young and &#34;tuned in&#34; to those times was a blessing beyond words. &#34;We&#34; thought it was truly the beginning of a new age of Love, peace, and joy that would spread over the entire world. Yes, pretty optimistic; but to us, it wasn't a hope or wishful thinking -- it was real. Looking back at that moment in history makes me smile and fills my heart with gratitude. &#34;Woodstock&#34; was a true demonstration of what life is like when the ego belief system of fear, and hate, which seems so powerful, is let go of for a moment -- and our attention is turned toward our true nature of Love and Peace. This film demonstrates what is possible when we let go, if only for a moment, of that ancient belief system of fear and hate. I think now would be a good time.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Been playing this game for years. Now I have it mobile. And my wife gets her nook back when we travel.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Just right for a lite comedy in the middle of the afternoon.  I have seen better but I have seen many a lot worst too.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I would definitely buy this game it is toats addicting I mean it's so much fun I can't stop playing this game
B001TM14VC|4.0|Corny, entertaining, a classic. Best aerial shots at the time.  This show made an ordinary BBQ joint into a successful tourist stop.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game! So much fun &amp; entertainment, definitely a good choice!  The minions keep me laughing the whole entire time. It is quite a challenging game though.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love it! I couldn't put it down! I played until I finished the game. I can not wait for part 2!
B00CF2UORK|5.0|My daughter and I love<br />This show. She is trilangual, and being able to fill<br />In our own words plus there being child-friendly and adult humor, it is a great show for the whole family!
B007WPM4P0|4.0|Good acting and the war scenes were horrific. There was a stark contrast with the peaceful pre war countryside but he story developed too slowly.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a nice surprise interlacing acquaintances and relationships.  You never really know everything.  You think you know people and make assumptions of ones you briefly know but you really never know
B008Y5OW20|3.0|Not his best work, but it's OK.<br />I think he's (like the rest of us) mellowing with age.<br />Still a Fan
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great book.  as a dog lover I truly enjoyed the authors perspective of writing from the dogs point of view.  We could all learn from some of these lessons.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Graphics and sound are better than the original. The ability to play for the &#34;Porkside&#34; is a neat twist. As with any Angry Birds game some levels are mor challenging than others but just as addictive as ever.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|We got this for the teleporter items being sold.  My kids love all the angry birds, and my husband and I enjoy trying to beat each other's scores.  The upside is that it's helping us get our kids into Star Wars.
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|This movie shows the rebuilding of Japan after the war.I remember at one time when the made in Japan label meant inferior quality<br />but not anymore.
B005PK57NU|5.0|This is a well written TV show that's full of drama. The characters are intelligent and engaging to watch as each case unfolds.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|I am very pleased with this purchase...  We are sharing with the family<br />We spend more time together doing something fun. and also, sharing with some friends. Having a good time.<br />Hope you continue creating more games.<br />Thank you so much Lego!<br />Maria E. Polson
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|Readable but no new history.  Thorough research, but assumptions presented as truth.  Good historian, eminently qualified, personal backstory irrelevant although it explains bestseller status.
193700788X|4.0|The last Sookie Stackhouse novel, I didn't want to read it because I did not want to say goodbye to the people that I had grown to love while reading this series.  I loved Sookie and her down to earth manner. I loved the easy going manner in which these books are written in.  I have read parts of Charlaine Harris's other series and by far, the Sookie books are the ones that I prefer; from the writing to the characters, they have always drawn me in.  That being said, this is a good ending to a series that I loved but it lacked the punch and the hectic pace of the other books, most likely because it was tying up loose ends.  I don't think that there are many surprises in this book, as it mostly ties of all of the story lines and the ending was predictable, but you know what, I didn't mind because it was what has been coming for a while now and I won't say more...spoilers you know.  If you loved this series, you will love this book.  If you have not read these books, although some things in this book will confuse you slightly, if it was the first in the series that you have read, you will still enjoy the book and it will make you go read the rest.  Rest in peace, Sookie -you deserve it and I will miss you.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|As good as season 1, with a deeper and more emotional tone due to the subject matter (war and societal upheaval). The cast is excellent as ever, the direction and writing impeccable for the most part.<br />It's not perfect, and the writing sometimes gets cheesy with &#34;daytime soap&#34; moments, but these are pretty rare.<br /><br />All in all, highly enjoyable.
B004KZOWEG|5.0|This book showed that nothing good can ever come from a country that has been put through so much at the benefits of others. The Congo is a prime example of this sad sad history. To blame them for where they are at today without looking back is criminal. It was certainly a great history lesson.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|The Walking Dead is simply the greatest show available.  This blue ray has many awesome features and is of stunning qality.  Any fan of The Walking Dead should own a copy.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was a poignantly funny, sad, insightful wonderful story. I was surprised when I purchased it that it was called a &#34;young adult novel&#34; and was a little disappointed that I'd been led astray by the person who recommended it to me. I was hooked from page 1. I highly recommend it!
B0064MPXFA|4.0|This is a really engaging series.  The clothing is beautiful.  The story lines are different enough that they keep your interest even though there are so many of them.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is a fast but very good read. The author does a fantastic job developing the many characters. Interesting and thought provoking. I recommend you read it!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A very good book and just like all of his book's very suspenseful. I would recommend this book to everyone.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Never heard of this movie. Rented because it sounded interesting. Turned out to be a super movie with good acting, excellent special effects, and unique twist for an ending.

B00DGQF0K0|5.0|I am a fan of 'can you escape' kinds of games.  This one is very good.  It's challenging and intelligent.  When you escape the room you can't help but feel a little proud of yourself.  I wish this game was endless, but alas, not yet!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. I've always loved reading Wimpy Kid books, I also own all the movies. It's a good book because it's funny and it makes you want to read more. I recommend it.
159463176X|5.0|I have read Khaled Hosseini's other two books and loved them.  I also saw him interviewed on the television, and was impressed by him.  It was great to have the book on its publishing date and not to have to brave the crowds.  As usual, Husseini has written a good story.
B008EKMB82|4.0|Outstanding writing, complicated issues, magic, tragedy, mystery all in one novel. I read this on a kindle and highlighting the footnotes was a bit &#34;fussy&#34; but worth addressing.
B00C0NFMKI|4.0|I love Paramore's previous three albums. I was really excited when this album came out. Their sound has changed a lot, but I like where their style is going. This album sounds a little more light-hearted and just fun.

B00064MW6K|5.0|I ordered this movie for my mom, and was pleased to see that it was delivered in a timely manner and that the DVD was not damaged in any way. My mom is a big fan Halle Berry so she loved this movie. Im not a big fan of superhero movies, but it wasn't painstakingly terrible. Unless you are some hardcore comic fan, this movie can be enjoyable.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|I was already familiar with a few of Adele's songs so I just had to purchase this collection!  She's got an amazing voice- you won't be disappointed!
0375805621|5.0|I loved the original book when I was younger and I loved reading it to my nieces and nephews.  When I became pregnant I made sure I had the original on hand and my son made short work of it.  I went to order another and found this book as well so I bought them both.  My almost 3 year old can almost tell both stories just by looking at the pictures because of how many times we have red both of them!  This is also a great size for younger readers.  It travels well in my purse too!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I love everything about this serie! Amazing actors, and good production. It's never too boring or too much. I just love it,

B008D28HYS|5.0|Everything about this game is great. It's fun, it makes you use your brain, it's smart... totally love it! Just one thing: they should add the possibility of background music on the puzzles.
0486274268|5.0|This book is so AWESOME it has the pictures of what the animals look like moving in it.  Will be well used.
B00AAQ7LP6|4.0|Good live DVD. Recorded well. A professional job. Rihanna is much harder live. One draw back. It is not suitable for some audiences.
B008J34466|4.0|IMO Pink's THE TRUTH ABOUT LOVE is a throwback to the pop, New Wave music sound of the 1980s--especially The GoGos or Belinda Carlisle.  It's funny how the 80s is coming back with such artists like Pink, Young the Giant, Arctic Monkeys, etc.

B000K8EQ5W|4.0|This is romantic fiction along with other titles like &#34;somewhere in time&#34;.  Good acting as usual from Sandra Bullock.<br />The story occurs in 2 different but interrelated times that eventually come together.  Like someone being able to change things to alter destiny so they can be together.  Liked it.
0553801473|5.0|Here it is! I couldn't wait for the release of this book!  The author answers lots of our questions but leaves lots of story lines for the next book. I can't wait! This has been my favorite series of all time... Hurry up, Goerge! I can't stand the suspense!
B0084AZXKK|5.0|It's been countless years since I've read this book as a kid. I had forgotten what a good story Mr. Stevenson has given us. I really enjoyed rereading it - with plenty of colourful characters and never a dull moment, this is truly a book for all ages. I'd highly recommend it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|If you like the first book you will love the 2nd book.  There are so many twists and you aren't sure what to expect.  Once you sit down to read it you are consumed until finished.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I liked the way the author interwove the characters and the events. It was unpredictable and a page turner until the end.
B007REV4T8|5.0|James Bond is a rite of passage for most young men.  Babes, bad guys, guns, and gadgets-what's not to like?  I was initiated at fourteen with \\"The Spy Who Loved Me' where Roger Moore was Bond and the eye candy was Barbara Bach and there was a car that turned into a submarine.  From there I saw the master, Sean Connery, on television showings and it became apparent that Moore was the lesser of two Bonds.  Regardless, I stayed loyal to the series even though they became parodies of themselves and were pretty much forgotten by me shortly after seeing them.  Pierce Brosnan was OK as 007 but there was still something lacking.  When Daniel Craig assumed the Bond role in \\"Casino Royale\\" there was a seismic change to the series.  No longer were the stories played for laughs because this was an agent to be taken seriously.  The tone is continued with \\"Skyfall\\" where we see gray areas of Bond's psyche and he is given a back story that explains some things and leaves enough ambiguity about his past that you want more.  \\"M\\"(Judi Dench)is given a slightly darker side to her personality which is worlds away from Bernard Lee smoking his pipe behind a desk.  Javier Bardem is probably the best Bond villain since Auric Goldfinger.  What elevates the film is the narrative which prior films had gotten away from and substituted with comic book antics.  There are enough twists and turns here to set the series up for years to come.  What I do like is while steering the film to the future it cleverly references the past.  Long live, Bond!
B00BVYU2P2|4.0|My review title says is all! :) Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the sexual content shown is slightly strong. I'm not saying it's not realistic, but it still isn't the ideal for high school kids, IMO, and watching even the parents accept it and the mom even be excited for the main character losing her virginity and being sexually active with a popular guy is... a bit off-putting. I don't want to see moms depicted as best friends even in sitcoms - it just makes it MORE acceptable, I think, and we don't need that. My thoughts. However, that said, I LOVE the show and it CRACKS me up! FANTASTIC!!! :-D
B00DYVUBYM|2.0|Ripped from the pages of \\"Vanity Fair\\" this account of So-Cal kids burglarizing celebrity homes is virtually disengaging.  I gather the message it's trying to convey is that the celebrity and high end designer label worship of the elders passes to their offspring but this film doesn't make a compelling case.  The fault probably lies with Sofia Coppola whose writing and directing are flabby at best.  All your basically left with is 1) Emma Watson sure has mastered an American accent well and 2) Taissa Farmiga sure looks a lot like her older sister, Vera.  Regardless this film barely made a blip when it was released last Summer and it certainly isn't a case of a neglected film being rediscovered.
1847940323|5.0|Great book - one of the best books I have read regarding leadership and managing change.  I would highly recommend it!

B00F5F0208|1.0|The original description of the title on the purchase page didnt mention that it was edited. only until now does it mention edited. very disappointed. wouldnt have purchased this one had it said EDITED in the heading.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Good novel with a very,very weak ending. Try to give us more to wonder about.  The novel needed to be 10 pages longer.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This novel had me captivated from the first moments of the prologue. The novel was well rounded. My emotions were with the characters with each turn of the page. Amazing read.

B00FEHXCIG|5.0|great action, great comedy relief, good plot!  And impressive that the third movie in a series can actually be this good!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loves this series. I can't wait for Season 4 to come in January. I do believe I like the UK Editions best.  The PBS version seems to loose improtant tidbits. Having this available for free with your Prime account more the returns the annual fee. Just great.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I like this game its pretty.fun but I wondern if u play others after u unlock it or do u have to download okay okay okay its it twenty yet geez

B00EB6ENXO|5.0|Best super hero movie ever. This story would have been great without the Iron Man tech. Good story, good script, good acting.
B006LSZECO|3.0|i find this book slow reading and there are many times i turn the page so i can get to the bottom line so this isnt the greatest but now that i am near the end i like the story
B00AGJ4HC2|4.0|I purchased this at Salt Lake Comic Con and was able to get a few games in with my wife and others while waiting in line waiting for our Stan Lee photo ops.  It was easy to learn, easy to teach, and went very quickly.  The card artwork is great and I like that it is a small game in the Tempest universe.  I have not seen or played the other games but they appear to be much larger and more expensive.  This game has piqued my interested in the others in this line.  I know that we got some odd looks from the little red bag ours came in as well as the name of the game, but once we started playing everyone had a good time.  I do think it would be a little easier to play sitting at a table that way you could more easily see what cards the other players discarded but this really isn't that big of a deal with only 16 total cards.  Great game and for the price you can't really go wrong with giving it a shot.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Fantastic cast, quality writing, and witty.  Good show all around.<br /><br />How is it possible that the Discovery Channel is lost in Amish Mafia and The Learning Channel has Honey Boo Boo and the History Channel has storage wars, and PBS is still producing Masterpiece Theater?  This is an argument for continued public funding for quality content if ever there was one.
B0094M2ODQ|4.0|when I first saw this movie years ago I didn't really care for it because of all the negative press I watched again now and I thoroughly enjoyed it and thought it was a wonderful story well worth seeing again I highly recommend it

B00EDPFJA4|3.0|This record  a more mature of side of Drake and continue growth as an artist. Overall the record is divided into high and lows throughout tracks sometimes I wonder if he wants to rap or just craft cleverly genius R&B tracks. However I say this is the best cash money record to date and that's not saying much.
B007FJFDXS|4.0|The objective of the game is to move a cube through various spaces to reach a goal.  There are three methods by which you can control the cube (you can switch between control modes in the \\"options\\" section of the home screen.  The default method is touch-based, you simply swipe in the direction you want the cube to move.  I tried this with both my finger and a stylus, and found it frustrating because the cube would advance much further than I wanted it to (meaning sensitivity was too much).  If you don't want to use touch controls, then they also have an option where you can control the cube by rotating the tablet itself - I found this to be even more difficult.<br /><br />There are 48 levels in \\"Normal\\" mode, plus 15 bonus levels that are labeled \\"Hard\\".  I haven't made it all the way through Normal mode yet, mostly because of my frustration with the controls.  But overall its a fun game, and the app has great graphics and cool sound/music design.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love it I play it all the time. Its a very addictive game, it will make you want to keep trying to beat your high score
B004YXE438|3.0|Spectrum Puzzles in an interesting app that challenges you visually.  It's just like a puzzle... you must put the pieces in the proper order and rotate them into the proper direction in order to solve the image.  You can select various degrees of difficulty -- a \\"Small\\" puzzle only has 12 pieces, that's very easy.  Then you have \\"Average\\" (20 pcs), \\"Large\\" (30 pcs), and \\"Huge\\" (48 pcs) which I must say is quite difficult and takes a long time to solve.<br /><br />There are about 50 images that come with the app, although you can purchase additional picture packages (or use your own pictures).  My biggest gripe is that the images are \\"locked\\" and only one image is unlocked at a time, so you have to progress in order.  For example, if I think image #11 \\"Pinwheel\\" is cool and want to try that one, I'd have to first complete images #1-10.  I'm not sure what happens if you get stuck on an image, there should be a way to skip levels (although I haven't found it).<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun game that's worth a try.  But the necessity of solving the puzzles in order diminishes the fun, it would be much better if all (or at least most) of the puzzles were unlocked from he beginning so that the user could select the images he/she wants to play.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a calculator that everyone needs at hand!<br />It has great features like the history of what you did, and if you swipe the bar you get even more options!<br />If I haven't persuaded you enough, this app is completely free!!!<br />What are you waiting for get this app!<br />It truly is a (+) plus.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This is an incredibly fun game that is both challenging and enjoyable.  The premise is simple - a large 3D cube is made of many smaller cubes, each with its own colors/patterns - you must find matching pairs of cubes as quickly as possible.  The tablet game is very interactive, you touch to match and swipe in various directions to rotate the large cube and get a new perspective.<br /><br />The only downside is the bright colors wear down my eyes, and I have to take a break in between games.  Perhaps a grayscale version could be made in the future - this would also make the game even more challenging since it would be based purely on different patterns rather than colors.<br /><br />GAME MODES<br /><br />PUZZLE MODE: Try to solve the cube as quickly as possible.  You can rotate the cube 360 degrees, so there are 6 faces of the cube to look at.  The cube also has depth, so as you find matches they disappear and reveal new ones on the inside.<br /><br />CUBE ATTACK: Several pairs of cubes appear every few seconds, you have to keep up matching them for as long as you can.  Its quite a challenge, and actually gets very tiring after a few minutes.<br /><br />STATIONARY CAMERA MODE: The same goal as puzzle mode, solve the cube as fast as possible.  The only difference is that you can't change the perspective of the camera.<br /><br />ONE MINUTE MODE & FIVE MINUTE MODE:  Clear as many cubes as you can in the allotted time (1 min. or 5 min.)

B009UAO1ZG|4.0|Just as contemporary America is sharply and acrimoniously divided over our role in the Syrian insurrection. the turmoil<br />in Egypt,and Iran's pursuit of nuclear power, so too, three quarters of a century ago, we were torn over whether<br />and how to intervene in Hitler's relentless domination of Europe.  With Roosevelt urging the country to aid<br />Britain and France in their war against  Germany, the &#34;isolationist&#34; forces,led by national hero Charles Lindbergh<br />were  calling for strict neutrality.  Author Lynne Olson does an excellent job in capturing the country's bitter<br />divisiveness over the issue, which ended only with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.  The parallels are striking.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I use it frequently, especially when planning trips. Glad to have it on my Kindle to access when I'm traveling.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have never been a book reader.  I keep hearing all my friends and family talk about how good the book is. After hearing Charlie Hunnam being casted as Christian Grey I knew I had to read the books.  Less than two weeks later I finished all three!  I couldn't put it down.  Looking forward to the movie and hopefully more  books to come.
B00BV5FVR0|5.0|The book was well worth the wait.  I have read the first two books a couple of times - now it is time to start from the beginning and read them as a trilogy! Margaret Atwood, you are my favourite author!

B00CIU3IVS|5.0|The movie, despite a rather glitzy appearance, impressed me a lot. The soundtrack is half of the movie. I like Florence and the Machine's Over the Love and all the other songs and music chosen for this modern classic. Blasting it daily!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As I posted when I began this long awaited book at 12:15 am on Tuesday, my relationship with Stephen King is the longest relationship I have had other than my father and my children.  I have read every book he has written and rarely been disappointed.  For almost 20 years every birthday I received one of his books as a gift or a gift to myself.  This was my gift to myself this year.  Thank you again, Stephen.  For the sleepless nights.  It was again, a wild ride for someone who despises rollercoaster.  Full of memories yet strangely personally relevant.  I am, one of the constant readers to whom you speak, with love and sometimes hate which is one of the hallmarks of any long term relationship.  You are in my heart, both the light and dark.  I relish the palaver.
B005VSRFEA|5.0|Though the early sections can be tedious for someone with background, the latter half regarding insights from the authors experience is worthwhile for anyone.  The author has a great deal of insight, and for me this book is a must read.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|great read! Flows really well. Writing style inhances the read. would appeal to most all readers of history get this book!
B004ADF7RO|3.0|I guess I didn't love this movie when it first came out. It's frentic, the jokes are obvious and play on stereotypes. I know so many peopled loved this movie, but I didn't love it then and don't love it now. Sorry.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Oh boy... I loved this book intensely, but there was a point where I needed it to end. I just couldn't handle it anymore. If you're familiar with Hosseini's work, you know better than to expect sunshine and roses. This book follows suit.<br />The beauty of his work is that he weaves a splendid tale, emotional, gripping and so vivid and real. You need to read it, despite, or because of the fact that it feels as if he were kicking you in the chest repeatedly as you read. But you like it, and you go back for more...<br />I won't summarize or give details. Others have and will. I will attest to the power of the story, though. I needed to know what would happen next as much as I was afraid to know. I couldn't put it down and it was hard to pick up. That is what makes it special.<br />It's beautifully written and tremendously emotional. I was a mess in the first 20 minutes and a mess for the last hour. It takes a toll. But it's beautiful and I'm so glad I read it.
B00CATSONE|4.0|It was interesting to me who has heard so much about Thos Edison, never heard of this man who did so many important things with electricity.
B003M6OW4Y|4.0|very good, not as great as season 1. thankfully, the network tho it canceled the show, gave the creators an opportunity to bring closure to the show. very well done. a shame the show didn't get the 4 or 5 seasons it deserved. in addition to being exciting and dramatic, the show has a moral ambiguity that is unusual but stunning. and the ultimate question is, who are we really? excellent. my 1 gripe is that the ultimate villain turns out to be one of my favorite characters. I am sure whedon and dushku (producer and star, she is terrific and hot!) planned it that way from the beginning but it didn't feel right, possibly because the show had to be condensed into 2 seasons. this is a thought provoking show. 2 of the big questions, who are we, or what makes us who we are, and can we really control dangerous science (a tried and true scifi theme very well done here)? highly recommended.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This was one of my very favorite childhood books.  It was nice to read it again on my new Kindle.

B008JEJKKU|5.0|Love these new Crocs, much better traction then my other older Crocs.  Color selection in great as well.  Highly recommend these for the gardeners out there.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Rent the HD, worth it. Use the biggest screen you have. Good plot to give meaning to the special effects, which are fantastic. Good references to past ST, but not so much as to get in the way of a new viewer.
B001NLL93W|3.0|Such a great book! I love how she writes and brings you into their world.<br /><br />I hate that Jace is so mean in this book but the end makes up for it big time.<br /><br />Hard to put down so make sure you have spare time on your hands.
B00DYEBM3I|5.0|It didn't occur to me until I listened to the album Seasons of Your Day right after Among My Swan that it's very much a continuation off their previous three albums. Music critics who say the band hasn't evolved, have very much missed the point. Which probably explains why they are critics and not artists.<br /><br />The organ and lyrics of Look On Down the Bridge, the last track of Among My Swan, lead directly into the first track, In the Kingdom, my favorite song off the album so far. My mind is blown. I'm in awe of how David Roback effortlessly compliments Hope's voice while leading the songs with his guitar playing. He's a true artist and musician.<br /><br />Mazzy Star probably isn't for everyone and that's okay. I generally play upbeat music but Mazzy Star is one of those bands that I go back to, to keep me grounded. Love it.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|great I love it but the controls are a little hard to turn and you had to whate four  you guy to get there

B000HSKUBE|5.0|Excellent political intrigue, even if it is set in 1990 London.  A bit short of a run though, with only 4 episodes in the first season.
B00C7JFIRC|5.0|They provide Fast delivery.  The movie was Well packaged.  Exactly as advertised.  I will definitely order more movies from this provider.
B00DHHWXYY|3.0|This wasn't a bad film, but it had several flaws...the overuse of \\"green screen\\" being one of them. The costumes and set were quite dazzling and beautiful, but it was so obvious that there was a green screen behind the actors in several of the scenes; I found it fairly distracting. However, the party scenes at Gatsby's house were especially well-done, and the viewer could really experience the hedonism going on there! (It's probably worth watching the movie just for those scenes). Leonardo does a very nice job as Jay Gatsby, and I felt he was faithful to the character portrayed in the novel by Fitzgerald. Carrie Mulligan did a stellar job as well with the pivotal character of Daisy. Yet, one of the aspects of the film that annoyed me the most was the music. I am a purist and would like to have heard authentic 1920's era music, instead of modern rap music! (I thought it was ridiculous in this film). Overall, I do feel that this movie is worth watching if you can get past some glaring flaws.
B001GLYMK6|5.0|Very nice and interesting movie! A lo ve story that have you concentrated all the movie! I have watched many times
B005I0DUMC|5.0|Everyone knows Stallone can act.  Rambo, Rocky and just about every  80s-90s action movie worth its salt are testament to his ability to entertain.  Many nay sayers didn't give him credit for his dramatic chops. Copland  puts all that to bed.  Stallone went method and proved he was worthy to share the screen with DeNiro, Keitel  and Liota.  Great flick!
B00ET9T2WK|3.0|Played this game for years on ipad.  Just a couple weeks in on kindle fire, purchased nanopods with Amazon coins.  App crashed.  Coins were deducted, no nanopods credited.<br /><br />Update: Amazon fixed this in three hours!  That is pretty incredible customer service!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Interesting, easy  read with some surprises.  I thought it was intriguing how the stories were connected yet also so separate.
B00EMJD6TC|5.0|Great movie for a great book. Much different than the book but still a great movie. Hope they make a sequel.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Kleon packs a lot of information in a very small book. And many of the concepts and lessons are on small index cards -- how clever! And I LOVE his Logbook idea, can't wait to begin one! Life is not a dress rehearsal, make every day count!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved this game! I wish it had been longer but I can't wait for The Room 2. I hope it will be as good as this one!
B00101ZOTA|4.0|I thought the movie itself was kind of run- of-the-mill, okay, but I wondered throughout why my daughter was so insistent I watch it.<br />Then I got to the last 20 minutes or so and, WOW, how could I not see that coming?  Terrific ending!
B004RKXW0E|5.0|It was fast shipping. came with with two figures. I wilol be buying more movies from you for sure Thank you!!!!! :)
B004J4WN0I|4.0|Reading this witty story, written with the kind of humor I like, was a very enjoyable experience.  The book was recommended by a friend of mine whose's taste I keep in high sentiment and she certainly did not disappoint me.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I don't often have time to waste on games; however, I when I find myself in a situation w/out connectivity I'm glad to have Angry Birds Star Wars II as a distraction and time waster.  For the non-gamer like me, it is worth the space it consumes on your Kindle Fire HD.
B0047VSW30|5.0|This movie is great! It shows just how wrong you can be when you know you are right. I recommend it to everyone.
076790592X|5.0|Reads well and one can find great comfort when faced with a loved ones death. I recommend this book to anyone looking for peace of mind.
B008D28HYS|3.0|I love doing nonograms and constantly download apps for them on my phone, so I was pretty thrilled when I saw this as a FOTD.  However, I got bored fairly quickly due to the use of different colors on a board.  Although the color picture looks good when completed, it made it somewhat easy to deduce what pieces were blocks and what were blanks since you have a cross reference.  I prefer just having the numbers and single color blocks and figuring it out.<br /><br />That said, it's not a bad app for someone just learning about nonograms and how to solve them.  They're definitely fun to solve.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|This abomination of ST continues where the initial reboot left off, creating a mere caricature of once was Star Trek. The result is a mindless, soulless and utterly pointless exercise in blockbuster stupidity. The plot is so idiotic it defies description, I can't and won't specify this any further or I am gonna have an aneurysm. One of the authors mentioned the great amount of social commentary STID was employing, I could find none. Not trying to be a nitpicker I could not escape noticing the giant plot holes and purposeful violations of Star Trek laws. I felt like I was watching a slapstick action comedy aimed at an audience of idiots, THIS IS NOT WHAT STAR TREK IS OR SHOULD BE! I could not find a single aspect of this picture I liked. JJ Abrams said himself that \\"the fans\\" were not only not his focus group, but that he even tried to make a movie not for fans but outsiders. Considering that statement, I believe he succeeded completely! And considering that very statement, can anybody please, for the love of god, explain to me why if he/they tried so hard to make something not for the fans they still felt compelled to include Khan, eugenics, Tribbles and basically ever other major plot line from Star Trek - the Warth of Khan into this picture? What am I expected to think about people that tell me that what I love is so lame it needs to be reinvented completely and then serve me a complete rehash even down to identical dialogue lines as a result? The only reason for that is that I, as a fan, are considered as being stupid. But hey, far from me to say anything against a movie that garners an 8+ rating on IMDB! All the more evidence that this film is aimed at a completely different target audience. Furthermore, the look of the film is reminiscent of a computer operating system, the sound effects were embarassing, the pacing was moronic, all the actors degraded to puppets of a braindead script and even the films pseudo-emotional climax was robbed of its impact by a clear setup-resolve scene early in the movie that serves no other logical purpose to reverse plot elements that occur later. Screenwriting for complete jerks!<br />As someone who has been watching ST for 25 years now I honestly feel like it may be best for me to just keep buying the great Blu Ray releases of the ST television series (all of them!) and stop right there. I even bought this movie in used condition because I couldn't bring myself to support what is being done to something I love so much. I dare ANYONE to honestly tell me that this CRAP is superior to what was done in ST both in TV and cinema before the reboot idea occured, I loathe these last two films and can only wish that this does not keep going on. Star Trek is such a great phenomenon and it sure as hell does not deserve this incredibly idiotic treatment any longer. Please, make it stop! One thing though I am really sure of: ST-The Wrath of Khan is 31 years old as of the writing of this review. I will be there in 2044 and will laugh my ass off when nobody talks about this piece of cinema BS anymore, let alone remakes it! In the long run, true quality reveals itself just like the lack of any will also!
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I spent the dollar on the paid version and still get ads- very annoying. The alarm clock works as expected, though.
B00149C8BK|5.0|Most of his great songs are here and its a good start for any MJ fan to have on the KIindle
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Too long and convoluted. Story could have been told in a much clearer format. Plot was good and enjoyed for a while.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Excellent book about an unique man! Inspiration for every one who wants to achieve something in this crazy world of ours
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book was not what I was expecting but I ended up falling for it all the same. I couldn't put it down! I'm counting down the days to the release of the 2nd book :)
0345803507|5.0|they were quick and book was in excellent condition! will order from them again if i need a book!!! awesome
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I dislike this book because it wasn't in a completely formatted way. I wouldn't recommend this long book to anybody.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|Really love this game, but have not been able to play this game in 2 weeks!! It is frozen and does nothing. Wondering if I have to uninstall and try again?
B00594XOZU|1.0|Why does kik<br />Stop working..will it ever work again? How will i log back into my kik?i need answers......if this happens to you..just know you are not the only one whos having this issue....

B00F96P8S4|5.0|Wonderful mix of upbeat,ballad, and love songs that can fit to anyone. &#34;Lovers Forever&#34;, &#34;I Don't have to sleep to Dream&#34;, and &#34;Dressed to Kill&#34;. Cher's best album to me so far, loved her since I was a kid!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I didn't particularly care for the game. I guess I am too old to enjoy games of this era unfortunately..
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Great remake! We love the action in this movie as well as the special effects.  Not your old Stallone movie!
B00729GQ0A|5.0|i really love this book. and love how its not all puppy dogs and rainbows. the ending was also great. very well writen!
B000E1YW0E|5.0|I remember seeing this in stores for near $20+ for a single disc, but for this price + a 2nd disc you can't go wrong. I love Rent and the fact that the 2nd disc includes a documentary is fantastic and will make you love it even more.
B00ANA27IU|5.0|I am a big fan of the movie but have been trying to answer a couple of questions and knew the book version would probably do that for me.  It is an easy story to read and follow, it took about 4 hours for me to do so.  Because Clarke answers some of the questions that Kubrick doesn't in his movie you may find the answers you were looking for but of course Kubrick's version forces you to think more on your own.<br />If you have never seen the movie, i would suggest you read the book after you see the movie, try to make your own answers to the questions you have first.  And if your answers don't match what is in the book, don't worry, that was the way Kubrick wanted it to be.
B00821OX98|5.0|this is a great show we watch as a family and  cant wait for the new season to start soon
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I started watching on recommendation from a trusted friend. I had to watch all 3 seasons. I just started season 3 and it is still great!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I'm a little more than halfway through the book and can't wait to find out how the story ends. Beautifully writyten!.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book is just brilliant. Read it in one night. Been looking for a good book to read for a while and glad I have got that &#34;I have read a good book feeling&#34;
B000I9VZJ8|1.0|about 120 minutes i'll never get back, Oh more words required, Should have got drunk or done laundry or something else.
B001K3K5MO|5.0|I have watched this movie 6-7 times & keep going back.<br />It is the only movie I own! The action scenes are great.
B0088W4YTK|4.0|Good show. To me the most entertaining of the stargate series'<br />I still have a season or 2 left to watch
B009RH9HDS|3.0|Everything about the case is nice but I wanted one with a hand strap for ease of reading (I have rheumatoid arthritis in my hands and this was critical). Unfortunately with one hand in the hand strap you must still keep the other on the Kindle at all times on the opposite side as nothing anchors it into the case and it will swing free. I just got mine and am about to do a return. If they fixed this issue I'd give it 5 stars.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|What's not to love about a good, old-fashioned, American action flick?  Make it retired, senior adult agents coming out of retirement, and it's all the better!
B00007GZR0|5.0|This is such an adorable movie. I love it! I love Doris Days work from this time period. She was so funny! So was Tony Randall. I am so glad I have this in my collection of old movies.
B00797MB0O|5.0|If you're a cynical person or grew up in a small town, you will probably relate to this film. It's a slightly &#34;dark&#34; comedy, but not a black comedy. Charlize is unwaveringly convincing as Mavis Gary. Themes of mid-life crises, mid-western angst, and living in the past populate the plot. As long as you can find value and enjoyment in a self-absorbed protagonist and a less than traditional moral/ending, you will probably enjoy watching this.<br /><br />I, personally, have re-watched it several times, which I seldom do with movies. There are layers here, if you look for them.
B000W746GK|5.0|I lost my original dvd so I purchased again. I absolutely love the Harry Potter series. I watch them while my kids are at school sometimes and I never grow tired of them. I especially like the first and second movies.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Fantastic App that does exactly as advertised. Your Kindle can be in sleep mode and it still works perfectly. Recommended to everyone.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I love these movies. We have all of the dvd's and my older kids read all of the books numerous times. Now my younger one is reading them. This is one of my favorite movies and I never grow tired of watching.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|This series is pretty intense, graphic and full of unexpected events.  It is a series that makes you think about the evil things that occur in our world today.
0399156577|5.0|Great characters, good depth and super plot this author brought all her skills to this book.<br />I really enjoyed it, thank you!!
B00F91SCXC|2.0|Typical Zombie movie. Nothing really new when it comes to these types of movies. Special effects are good, but, other than that, nothing new.
0786891459|5.0|This is a hard book to review as it is truly one of a kind. The story line has 2 stories running parallel . The past and the present of the main character. I enjoyed this book from beginning to end. It is so cleverly written . If there was any part that dragged it might have been the detailed history of the hero Allan  Karlsson. However,as  the story unfolds all the loose ends fit together brilliantly. This book was recommended to me from the English book centre in Valbonne France. I laughed and grew to know all the characters so well described. It is such a fun read and as you go thru the  history of Allan and his life...there is a lot of history and human nature that will expand your mind and put a smile on your face.
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|Given that 'The Shining' is one of my favorite novels of all time, I approached 'Doctor Sleep' with caution. On the one hand, I was looking forward to it. On the other, I was worried it would be a huge disappointment. Now that I've finished it, I can honestly say that even if it isn't quite up to the standards of 'The Shining', it's still one of the best new horror novels I've read in recent years.<br /><br />If you're reading this review, you probably know that the protagonist this time around is Danny. Without giving too much away, his time since the end of 'The Shining' has been traumatic, but he still has his gift. Stephen King does an excellent job of keeping the story rooted in the original book, while expanding upon it greatly. There were some nice touches, and King's trademark inventiveness was on display with a number of new creations that still hold fascination once the novel is over. If he wanted, King could easily write a spin-off focused on a certain community of travelers.<br /><br />Overall, as a fan of 'The Shining', I'm very glad that King wrote this new book. It adds to the original, but it's far from a nostalgia-fest. It's new and thrilling, and it would stand alone perfectly well even if the original book hadn't come before.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Maybe the second time around he really WILL kill her because she sure needs it.  Very irritating book. Two more words.
B001FW58D6|2.0|I had high expectations for this show, but the pilot, at least, didn't click. There were some interesting characters, but I thought the main plot was very dull, and the narrative was too thin to be stretched out to this particular running time. Visually, I also thought it was quite drab. Production quality was high, and I'm very much aware that this show has a big fan base. I'll watch some more, but the pilot definitely dragged for me. I kept checking to see how much more was left, because I was a little bored!
B004P8JPS6|3.0|The author appeared to have run out of writing time and abruptly ended what WAS a very good book.  Retta
B0046B6X1E|1.0|Movie kept having to buffer. This is getting to be a common problem with amazon movies. I have cox high speed Internet (26mbs) and can run netflix on four devises at once here. But can hardly watch one on amazon.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I liked the book but was sad about the way it ended. However there really wasn't  a good choice  in endings either way.<br />I have recommended to others.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|A terrific movie with a great sound track!!  Cast of characters is unforgettable. Definitely not for the kiddies, though,<br />.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Trekkies are going to be thrilled and it sounds like we are set up for more to come!  Oh but wait!  I hear the reviews for it by the geeks was not good.  Oh well, go figure.  I thought Zachary Quinto was a great Spock.  We liked the action backed film and thought the cinematography was fabulous.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|We have loved all the movies! So having the game has been GREAT! The whole family plays together taking turns collecting and feeding the animals! Thanks for the game awesome and free!
B007JNWJMI|5.0|love love love it!!!!! having so much fun editing my own photos and don't have to pay for a professional
B006SV2LWA|4.0|Contagion was a 3 the first time I watched it, and a solid 4 the second time. This is a good movie, but its minimalist approach has thrown some people off, but for me it got better with age.<br /><br />This is the antithesis of a Hollywood movie: no high-octane action, no super-heroes, just realistic characters dealing with an epidemic in their own desperate way.  It follows a low-drama, documentary style approach that bounces between the governmental efforts to combat the virus and several human events stories that run through the movie. It has a similar feel to Traffic, which Soderbergh directed. The Matt Damon thread deals with the plight of the average family, the Jude Law thread deals with the financial profiteering aspect, and the Laurence Fishburne / Kate Winslet thread deals with the government response to the virus.<br /><br />All the threads of this movie are very human, showing everyone's warts as they wrestle with the social ramifications of the virus.<br /><br />The performances are all outstanding as you would expect. For some reason though, Laurence Fishburne and Kate Winslet's performances stand out to me. Very strong, very believable, very human.<br /><br />Give it a chance. Very good movie.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I thought the book was wonderful I would definitely read it again. The humor in the book was great though it's definitely not a comedy I would recommend this boom to anyone who enjoys reading.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I enjoy not only the kindle but I had some problems and the Kindle support group helped me immensely. They exceeded my expectations!
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Like always Mr. le Carre is a master of his trade. I never have been disappointed by any of his books.and he is at the top of his game now
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This is one of those movies that captures the essence, adds the familiarity of the songs, and honors the story of the play and converts it into a movie. The movie should be judged as a separate entity. Those faithful to the Broadway Musical will absolutely have mixed feelings about this. I am not sure about the DVD, but the Blu-Ray has a Singing Live special feature and talks about how the cast sang live, and it also explains the differences between the play and the movie. Anne Hathaway described it best when she said \\" I can't sing this pretty.\\" And she said it not to say she can't sing but instead it was an issue of believability. You just witnessed all the things Fantine had to go through and you can't believe that after all that this song would be sung pretty. I had never heard I dreamed a Dream sung that way before and it gave me a whole new feeling to a story thatI thought I knew pretty well. And It wasn't just Anne. All the cast really made this film extraordinary. Also in that same documentary, the actors could choose how to act and sing, and Eddie Raymond made a good point about how usually you pre record the music and then lip sync to it and the problem with that is you need to make acting choices months before meeting the cast, crew and sets, which doesn't necessarily match up when you are actually acting and engaging with the elements. The actors actually acted and did not just go through the emotions and lip sync to prerecorded material. At the last part of this behind the scenes, they show how the director and the conductor directed the orchestra in changing the way the music is played to fit the emotions and singing methods of the actors, and the songwriter for the broadway version was there to listen and give feedback, so they really covered all their bases. It was truly some of the best 10-20 minutes of behind the scenes footage I ever watched. As for Russell Crowe, because he is probably the most criticized, he is growing on me the more I watch this. Stars is my favorite song from the men, and it was a little rough the first time I heard it, but I have to say watching the movie over and over again, he seems to get better sounding to me, and he is a lot stronger by the time Javert's Suicide came on. His presence fit as Javert, afterall he was the Gladiator, but vocally I wish he was stronger, especially pitting him against Hugh Jackman who is vocally trained.<br /><br />In conclusion I absolutely love this movie and it should be judged separate from the play, and the actors really made the songs their own, which added a different dimension to the story and it's characters. 5 STARS TODAY AND ALWAYS!
B002W7H3EA|5.0|One of the best movies ever made. So easy when it can be streamed. The only problem was the streaming was interrupted a few times, but I think it was because I had my I pad on at the same time
B000W967UQ|5.0|Another wonderful Discworld book.  Some characters you will recognize, many are new.  Pratchett is wonderful all around as usual.<br />Despite being about death I was laughing my butt off.<br /><br />Death takes an awkward boy on as an apprentice. After teaching him the basics Death lets him do some solo runs.  But Death starts enjoying his time off too much.<br />What will happen to Mort?  Read it and find out, it's worth it,I promise.
B000UIVRXG|5.0|Love this movie as well as any with Simon Pegg. Comic genius. The streaming at times can be a problem for me but I believe it is my Internet service.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this app is great and really fun to play you should really get this game I reccomend it really fun for kids and adults
076115678X|3.0|There is no more information in this book than what I have already found by searching online for hair care tips for naturally curly hair.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Its just more of the great story. I want more every time I put it down. I feel like I know these people
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book really made me think! I thought about it a lot even after I was done reading it. Kept me reading for hours. Must read if you like books that make you think. I highly suggest it for all.
B00F96P8S4|5.0|I am a long time Cher fan, and was eagerly awaiting this release.  Her voice sounds amazing, and I am glad she mixed it up with having some ballads & dance songs. Definitely a must have for any music lover!
B008Y6WMEY|4.0|I've kicked myself everyday since watching this classic because I waited so long to actually WATCH it!  What a great, dark comedy! Love the technical military dialogue and of course, the subtle, cynical humor!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I am ready for the next one and can only hope it is as good.  I am leery of sequels.
B002PEP4C8|5.0|This book deeply touched me.
048623231X|5.0|Very pleased with the book.  Great  and large pictures.  It is a great companion to my studies on Dante.  Thank you.
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|How can you not love Harry Potter, the books are better but the movie was beautifully done. Would def recommend.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|A very well written, fascinating insight into probably one of the most complex and enigmatic individuals to ever start and run a business. The author has drawn on a huge variety of sources including personal contact to create not only a brilliant biography of Steve Jobs and his complex (even wierd at times) personal and business relationships, but also has intertwined that with a history of the companies (Apple, Next, Pixar) in which Jobs was intimately involved and demonstrates how his personality and actions built, destroyed or rebuilt them.<br />A long book but one that is so interesting it is difficult to put down. Strongly recommended, especially for those interested in the story of Apple and modern computing and also for those who enjoy or study business cases and who wish to understand how, under Jobs, companies like Apple and Pixar got to the top of their game.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|Love this movie.  Audrey Hepburn is just fantastic.  They just don't make great films like this anymore!!  Would highly recommend.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|It works quickly and all information is clear on the Kindle.  Just got it and used it once, expecting to use it often.
B00F91G5BS|5.0|Kept me interested the entire time, Great action could not ask for much more.  I would recommend it to any zombie fan!
B00F4KGJRO|5.0|One of the best albums Alan J has ever done, along with the Gospel one. But all of his albums are great.  THANKS ALAN,  WELL WORTH THE WAIT..<br /><br />THANKS AMAZON FOR MAKING IT SUCH A GREAT AND EASY AFFORDABLE PURCHASE.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It is really helpful and it has a variety of different things on it that you can use. It's outstanding
B00EP0KYDO|2.0|A very generic storyline with very little imagination. There was so much more that could have been done with this universe. All I see is waste.
B00F35BV64|4.0|I thought the twist on the KHAN character gave this STAR TREK a great edge & created an interesting dimension in the Star Fleet vs Klingon history.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Brilliant - did not have an inkling until very near end. Great character study of how we pretend to ourselves how well we know the people we live and interact with on a daily basis.
B0012HRJEA|5.0|this is by; far my favorite interpretation of Shakespeare Romeo and Juliet....and  who could ever get tired of watching Leonardo DiCaprio..
B0081KTHEQ|5.0|Will be trotting this out on a regular basis for my Halloween viewing.  Danial Radcliffe is an excellent actor becoming better with each role he takes on.
1592402038|4.0|After being assigned to read chapter three of Eats, Shoots & Leaves by Lynne Truss for my college writing class, I found it extremely fitting that the chapter was titled \\"That'll do, Comma\\". Commas have always been something that caused me much confusion in writing. Reading this chapter of the book was truly informative and surprisingly entertaining. A quote that really solidified the meaning of this chapter for me was, \\"No wonder feelings run high about the comma. When it comes to improving the clarity of a sentence, you can nearly always argue that one should go in; you can nearly always argue that one should come out.\\" (Truss, 80). The chapter covers all the broad topics of comma use that many of us would rather not admit to needing fine-tuning on: commas for lists, joining and gaps. Overall, I appreciated Truss' creative thought and touch of humor on a rather otherwise bland topic.
B004XNGKBS|3.0|This app was okay but I didn't use it long. Now with Google keep, I don't think there is a need for this app.
B00D6M86RS|5.0|Love this game. Just wish it came with a couple more free boards. I want to try them all but don't want to pay. Plus, which one to chose when you do pay. They all look awesome.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I did use this for awhile but there are better alternatives to this app nowadays. Also with youtube allowing offline viewing (with a caveat), these aren't needed as much anymore.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Second time I have read the Trilogy and it was even better this time around!!! Recommend it to everyone, everyone can take something from these books!!!
0345477618|4.0|I always enjoy Star Wars lore and how it's made. This is a great book to show you how it was made and the pictures are great.

030726999X|4.0|Great book, couldn't put it down. The paperback was what you would expect so nothing fancy here. I would recommend this series to anyone of age.
B00DLKXF3A|4.0|I like this but takes some getting use to their darker heavier sound.  I am partial to previous cds.  I am and will remain a fan.  Check out their new cd.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Great app for listening to tunes in the car. I like the interface and it's easy to find stations I like.

B0058EBNAO|3.0|Decent but the look I don't like. Overall there are some better, cleaner looking apps for weather although this does give you a lot of information. Just not for me.
B000I186FW|5.0|I love this movie! So well done and love Natalie Portman. What a great way to intertwine history and life.
1401324029|4.0|I've gotten to be a fan of Castle on tv and this is an enjoyable extension of the tv show...sort of an edgy Mickey Spillane type<br />theme..
B000002G23|5.0|This was a used set and had a little wear on cover. No issue with me. Discs and insert was in perfect condition. Great savings over a new set
B002VHI8FE|4.0|Somewhat heavy in places, it plods through what knew hopes will be the information needed for the rest of the series.<br />Enough thought has been out in to make it an interesting read. Look forward to the next one.
B00B0YL0E0|5.0|I have got into Pretty Maids since Future World and they never disappoint on their albums. Yes...they throw in some chessy ballads here and there but that have always put out great albums. This is no exception. Not as heavy as their last, but still solid
B007REV4YI|5.0|Skyfall marked the 50th anniversary of James Bond on film (no that was not a typo). Bond is much different now than he once was, but at the same time he is much like how he was when he first began. While the tone of this story wasn't quite as action filled as some of the other entries it undeniably has the best cinematography of any other movie in the historical franchise.<br /><br />The production and set designs were outstanding and even the wardrobe, particularly that of James Bond's (provided by Tom Ford) helped make the movie visual gold. The plot was fantastic in the way that it was unassuming and respected the intelligence of the audience. Because of this we were led to some more surprising events in the film. Traveling the world is a tradition in James Bond, but you have never seen it like this before. The locales were so exquisitely showcased it simply gave you an undeniable desire to make the journey to places like Shanghai and Macau.<br /><br />I think the final showdown is one of the best ever. Overall if you are looking for a run and gun James Bond action flick, maybe try one of the Pierce Brosnan pictures, but for the first time in a long time I felt like I was watching art in a James Bond movie in a case of both style and substance.
B00CXQL828|5.0|I do have to say most of the music released lately in terms of metal/progressive metal has been very disappointing. Little creativity or effort to come up with something new. As this album is not ground breaking for new original sound, it is an album that gives you well written and produced songs. The production is great which make it enjoyable to listen and jam
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love love love this game. Always something different and doesn't get old. refuse to play on my phone because the kindle screen is bigger.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have no restraints when it comes to SK.  I am an adult with responsibilities and out the window they go...as I turn each page, absorb each chapter, and rue the end of his latest novel.  Hasn't changed since our first date, unfortunately.  About the book, you ask? I am sending a resounding 'Thank you' to the fan circa 1998 who asked the pivotal question, &#34;Do you ever wonder...?&#34;  That's all YOU get from me as  I sit here considering whether I should dust off my old dog-eared copy (you KNOW to which novel I am referring - and if you DON'T, you soon will) and open that tome to release a long-quiet craziness...Should I?  (chuckles softly) Is there really a choice?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I LOVE ALL ABOUT THIS GAME SUCH AS MOTION, SOUND<br />IT Makes me feel like I am taking care of a real horse, so fantastic
B0056BMK6K|5.0|this is a book for all that are tired of the race after traditional publishers. This ebook really opened my insight into other very possible opportunities as an author. The race does not end when traditional publishers all rhyme to the same negative response to your manuscript. Monsieur Locke showed me how to go about it.(Funkè Ojo http://loveonpoint.blogspot.be)[[ASIN:B00D5OAETA Face 2 Face]]
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|It was a bit farfetched, but i still enjoyed it.  I really loved the Slammed series and thought it was better, but if you liked that, you will like this too.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|It is a fun app, but you could get more precise lines if you had a sylus to work with.  My fingers are too big to make anything but abstract drawings.  I can't get thin precise lines.  It is a fun app and would be great for kids.  Everyone likes to doodle and this app satifies that desire.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|It's a bit small, a bit pricy but amazing for a builder! The minecraft Lego set is awesome it's just like minecraft! Legos and minecraft, what a great combination. Will recommend to builders.
B00D2CYU2W|2.0|There must be a dearth of TV movies if this one won 15 Emmy Nominations. Michael Douglas does not deserve an award; he didn't even try to alter his obnoxious voice to sound like Liberace, or even act like Liberace; Douglas can't act anyway. Matt Damon  deserves an award for putting up with Douglas. The movie lacks professionalism, even the picture quality is bad. Everyone knows the simple story; it's been on TV several times in many guises. This version is boring: it lacks pizzazz and the requisite camp. The end is absurd. Items in \\"Features\\" should have been in the movie. Rob Lowe, as the plastic surgeon, looked good; maybe he worked on himself. The music is well recorded. Douglas looks as if he is really playing the piano (if that is important to you); besides the antique autos it's the only realistic thing in the movie. The budget must have been blown on costumes and sets (including Zsa Zsa Gabor's house) with no money left for a decent production. Pehaps gay movies need gay directors. \\"La Cage Aux Folles\\" would have been a flop if these incompetents were in charge. It would never have become a great musical either. This turkey is dead in the barnyard. That could be good enough since Thanksgiving is lurking around the corner. I thank Matt Damon for giving it the old college (Harvard) try, though. Unfortunately the producers don't know that \\"candelabra\\" is plural and \\"candelabrum\\" is singular. All I ever saw was one candlestick on Lee's instrument. Yes, I bought it on Amazon, more than I can say for the bogus reviews.<br />Post scriptum: I forgot to mention that in this paltry, poultry production, Liberace credits his penile implants for his ability to peform four times a day ouch! Talk about a pain in the ...! Any episode of Canadian made \\"Smallville\\" has more professional production and picture quality than this saurian descendent.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|This series has been a painless review of world history.  Love the characters and sub-plots.  Well written and well worth the expense.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I have read every Dan Brown book and really enjoy his stories. Clearly he does enormous research for his books and while fiction there is a great deal of historic foundation in his work.
B007704HO6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Cats are amazingly perceptive and they choose their owners who need their love. I loved the fact that Bob was there for James in his time of need.

0307271609|4.0|In 2005, my family took a trip to China. The Summer Palace near Beijing was a highlight, and I remember the guide's comments about the budget-busting extravagance of the woman who created it, Empress Dowager Cixi. I walked away thinking of her as a greedy tyrant.<br /><br />I'm glad Jung Chang -- whose \\"Wild Swans\\" is a must-read for anyone with any interest in China -- is here to correct that impression with her biography. Cixi was a complex, powerful, smart human being, operating in a world where much of her power had to be exercised behind the scenes. Chang's book is well-researched and very readable. It's high time Cixi had an advocate like this. She wasn't a saint, but she shaped the country China is today.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book helps everything in my perception to be corrected! I friggen LOVE it. I've been blogging about it, and telling EVERYBODY I meet about it.
B009KWU6Q2|4.0|Remember this movie from years ago.  Wanted to see it again.  It was just as enjoyable.  Something without violence, bad language, and entertaining.

B000H4TX9I|4.0|I was told about this show by some friends.  I do like science fiction but Firefly is not the typical Sci Fi.  I enjoy this show and wish their were more episodes.  It is offbeat and the characters are an interesting group.  I have not finished the complete season so I hope that the remaining shows will be as enjoyable.  I also intend to view the movie that sums up this show.  To bad they decided to cancel this show. I would highly recommend this show if you are looking for something a bit different.

1416583432|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Some of the things I learned are things you never really thing about or you think they do for other reasons...like why your dog gets crazy after taking a bath and rubs all over everything.  If you are a dog lover, this book should be added to your collection. You will definitely take some things away from it to use with how you interact with your own dogs.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Excellent piece, he did a wonderful job, there are a lot of fine nuggets<br /><br />Thank you James, good job mate
0140386335|5.0|I loved the movie as a child and recently realized I had never read the book. The books are always better then the movies, so of course, I loved the book. If you loved the movie growing up or your children love the movie now, this is a must read. I can't believe I didn't read it sooner.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Dr. Eben Alexander's Proof of Heaven is a must-read for the scientific-minded person who may struggle with theology because of his/her left-brained dominance.  In fact, Alexander himself was one who fell into this category of thinking until he found himself in a life-threatening coma for seven days.  During this time, Alexander's brain was, in essence, not functioning.  Alexander, an academic neurosurgeon, is able to explain the intricacies of his illness in layman's terms for the scientifically challenged like myself and still maintain reader interest.<br /><br />Alexander describes in vivid detail his life-changing experiences in those seven days while in the presence of God or \\"Om\\" (as he refers to Him), the Realm of the Earthworm's-Eye View, the Core, and the Gateway.  According to statistics,  this man should have perished from his sickness let alone have some lingering brain damage if not complete incapacitation.  Instead, Alexander fully recovers, a medical miracle.<br /><br />For the purposes of book club, a spread composed of eggs would definitely prompt discussion for as Alexander writes:<br /><br />While in the Core, even when I became one with the Orb of light and the entire higher-dimensional universe throughout all eternity, and was intimately one with God, I sensed strongly that the creative, primordial. . . aspect of God was the shell around the egg's contents . . . (160).
034580404X|5.0|It took me a while to finally decide to read them after they came out and whole hoopla started. I had never read erotica before, and I wasn't sure I wanted to start. I was glad I did. All three of them were a little different. The first book was sex sex sex, the second book was a little action, and the third book got lovey dovey. I enjoyed reading all three and will reread them again. I heard they will be making movies...I don't know how that is going to work out, but the books are great. There have been a few series that have come out afterwards and have tried to follow in this series footsteps, but I think they have all failed. If you haven't read them yet and have been on the fence, I would take the plunge and try them out.
B00AE1P8UM|5.0|If you live by the book, it will be so. Believe in the power of the subconscious, it's very true and can be life changing.

030758836X|5.0|Amazon kept recommending me this book, and I kept putting it off. When I finally purchased it, I was bummed I didn't read it sooner. I ordered both of her other books as soon as I was done (and I actually might have ordered them before I even finished). Great read, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good book.
B007N0REX6|5.0|This has to be one of the best albums out there today. Love the way Slash plays in all these songs!

B0063GORYU|4.0|Very addicted to this game.<br /><br />My only complaint is that sometimes, whether using a stylus or by touch, that it becomes either super-sensitive or doesn't register my move at all.  Which can be frustrating when you are being timed and trying to beat your personal record.<br /><br />Note:  I have this app on both my Kindle and another device.
0345803493|3.0|Read all three......made for interesting conversation between a lot of my friends including couples.  Curiosity killed the cat on these books. lolol
0345803507|3.0|What can I say........I read it all the way to the end because of all the reviews and out of curiosity.  Ordered all three and thought the last was the best because it had a actual storyline. lol lol
031623480X|5.0|I am definitely gluten sensitive. Under a variety of tests, some say that I do have Celiac's disease, others, not so much. What I do know is that by avoiding gluten (and taking probiotics) for almost two years now, my gut health and IBS have improved dramatically. I'd like to quote from the introductory chapter of Dr. Perlmutter's book:<br /><br />[\\"So exactly what is \\"grain brain?\\" I think you already have a clue. It can be best understood by reflecting back on an old news bulletin. If you were paying attentions to advertising in the mid-1980s, you might recall the public service announcement for a large-scale anti-narcotics campaign that featured an egg in a frying pan with the memorable tag line \\"This is your brain on drugs.\\" The powerful message suggested that the effect of drugs on the brain was like that of a hot pan on an egg. Sizzle, sizzle.]<br /><br />The book is well-written and researched, in my opinion. It delves in to the Why, How and then What you can do about properly nourishing your brain.<br /><br />Specific tests are suggested as well as supplements. It's clearly explained why all of these can be beneficial.<br /><br />I was already a believer and have read a lot of material on gluten sensitivity, good/healthy fats, the dangers of trans fats and high fructose corn syrup; including several peer-reviewed medical journal articles.<br /><br />Dr. Perlmutter has done a very good job of collecting current information and presenting it in an easy to understand manner for the lay person.
0345803485|4.0|Read all three......made for interesting conversation between a lot of my couple friends. Hubby and I had fun with these three books.  Curiosity killed the cat on these books. lolol  Found parts of it so darn funny.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|As a person who participates in Bible study I find this perspective quite interesting.<br />It does not change my belief system but reinforces what I believe. I hope others will take it in the way it is presented, as history. I am anxious to receive my copy of Killing Jesus as it may interesting to compare the results of the historical research that was done in writing both books.
B000002J1Y|5.0|As mentioned in a previous review, I'm fairly new to the Yes scene, having purchased &#34;The Yes Album&#34; in 1980 and &#34;90125&#34; in 1983. I just never followed up on any of their other releases. Loved both of those though.<br /><br />Well, over the last couple of months, maybe three, I've been getting aquainted with some of their other earlier releases. While discussing my new found fondness for the Yes sound, one of my friends introduced me to &#34;YesSongs&#34;, their 1973 release of their 1972 &#34;Close To The Edge&#34; tour. I'm typically not a big fan of live albums as they tend to not live up to my Xpectations...barring a handful of great ones. This album is maybe where all Yes fanz should begin...I know, most of you reading this are probably already way into Yes...Even though it is live, it is clean and vibrant, and it seems it actually rocks just a little harder than thier studio releases of the same material. I've always thought &#34;The Yes Album&#34; was their best and even now after acquiring &#34;Close To The Edge&#34; & &#34;Fragil&#34; I still think it is their best studio release, but &#34;YesSongs&#34; is the crowning achievement of their three releses (71-72). It's just my opinion as I've pretty much enjoyed every note I've heard from the Yes cataloge thus far. If you are already acquainted and a fan of Yes, but don't have this album in some format, I highly recommend you get it. I think you'll get your money's worth out of it.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Is a good story but too slow. I have not finished yet. I am not engaged in the reading. boring
B00ESY77LO|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie! It's been a while since I watched the original, but it seemed to follow it pretty well. Music was different, but still liked it :)
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|My kids like the game, but it isn't their favorite.  They like it better than the first Angry Birds Star Wars because there are more characters and features
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I thought it lived up to the standards of the original Star Trek movies, which I loved.  The acting was excellent and the characters come very close to their original counterparts.  The storyline was exciting and complex.
B002ZG980U|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie. My boyfriend showed it to me and I had to go out and buy my own copy. In my opinon it has a  great story line. After 4-5 watches (lol) I understand everything about this movie. I've gotten my friends hooked on it, my brothers and currently working on my parents. definitely a must buy
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Very nice price and very functional.<br />I have Seiko watches for more than 40 years.<br />Never fail. I still have one that I bought in Viet Nam in 1970.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Some favorite lines from DS:<br /><br />\\"He had come to believe that life was a series of ironic ambushes.\\"<br /><br />\\"We're all dying. The world's just a hospice with fresh air.\\"<br /><br />Chetta believed that most people who worked in the arts were just high-functioning schizophrenics.\\"<br /><br />\\"..the kitchen looked like hell in a  high wind.\\"<br /><br />(commenting on someone dying at the hospice the previous night) \\"I guess God pushed another one of His ornaments off the mantelpiece last night.\\"<br /><br />And this one, which might describe the way King feels about himself, even with his tics and imperfections and little habits like needing a night light when he sleeps: \\"In her deepest heart, she had never regretted what she was.\\"<br /><br /> It took me two days, but I read this nonstop and loved nearly every minute of it. Like many others, I thought it petered out a bit at the end, but still and all, a great tale from a guy still pretty much at the top of his game. Is it just me or is Steve getting more religious as he ages? Anyway, the willing suspension of disbelief was tested a bit at certain points, especially in the climatic scenes, but this book was a lot of fun and it's easy to recommend it to anyone. Kudos as well to King for continuing to use less and less potty-mouth words.
B000FC0P9E|5.0|Love this book. This is the third time I've read it. It never fails to creep me out. And it has a good ending.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Wow. I'm used to books with extensive magic systems and lots of in your face imagination. This was an awesomely balanced story that DESERVES A FOLLOW UP! This was one of the best stories I've read in years. I was never bored, lacking for entertainment, or just plain WTF? No, this Author has Nailed it. Usually you can get a feel for where the story is going or what to expect, but there was so many surprises and moments of, Ahhhh satisfaction. Nice and long, wish it was longer. I actually was bummed when I finished. Please Anthony Ryan, do some more writing, I see that there's not much at all out there from you, but you have that certain style that's gonna make you very very popular and sought after. I'd love to read more from you.
B009UNH0EM|1.0|UNBELIEVABLE.  I bought this BT in July and it already stopped working.  My window for returning or replacing it has expired?  Really?????  Fully charged and it just won't turn on.  It worked great up until now.  Funny the worst customer service comes from Amazon not the other venders who sell on it.
B00AZNEW5G|2.0|The 2012 Best Picture lineup--let's face it--hasn't been all that impressive.  I have seen six of the nominated films--no interest in seeing Amour, Silver Linings Playbook or Beasts of the Southern Wild--and the only ones of those two that I thought were any good were Argo and Django Unchained.  Zero Dark Thirty, is my most recent viewing of a Best Picture nominee, and needless to say, Act of Valor was a much superior film in every way (and that is no insult to AoV either, since it is a much better film that what most people give it credit for).<br /><br />And to quickly establish myself here, I am quite fond of Kathryn Bigelow as a filmmaker.  Point Break remains one of my favorite films of 1991, and one of my favorite films to star either Keanu Reeves or Patrick Swayze.  And The Hurt Locker was most certainly one of the three or so best films of 2008, and one of the four better choices to select for Best Picture in 2009, along with Inglourious Basterds, A Serious Man, and Up in the Air.  So, after I heard that Kathryn Bigelow wasn't going to try to connect any dots to our current occupent as a means of praising him for the death of Osama Bin Laden, I was willing to give this one a shot.<br /><br />And boy, is this film a letdown.  Jessica Chastain does a great job playing static and robotic, without much of a character beyond her career-long obsession with finding and killing Osama Bin Laden.  Understandably, Bigelow directed her to play it subtle to the enth degree.  But as a consequence, she is boring.  The film is over 150 minutes long.  The history behind the manhunt as it was retold to us is astronomically uninteresting.  Whereas a film like A King's Speech benefited from the lack of information on what really happened during King George's therapy sessions, this film clearly didn't have the classified intel critics were going ape$#!+ over, and did very little to nothing to help matters much.  The hunt lasted for about 10 years or so.  We heard very little ofwent on behind the scenes if anything at all.  And there was literally nothing Bigelow had done to try to make it exciting, intense, or interesting.  Well, until the very end when she finally tracks down where he is hiding and sends some soldiers down there to find and execute him.<br /><br />It's a boring 2 hour exercise with an interesting beginning and a thrilling ending.  So much could have been trimmed because the film as a whole just doesn't work.  But out of respect on the film's strongest assets, I'm willing to give this film a 4 out of 10.  I can't condemn it, but neither can I recommend this one.  I wish I could.  That translates to a 2 out of 5 by Amazon standards.
B00DURHYWC|1.0|I have loved all of the previous music and pre-ordered this CD. A few of the standards such as Sway With Me etc. were good, but the majority of the new selections were a let down. The last song was terrible and the lisp of the vocalist was not edited out. Hopefully, the next CD will be up to their usually high standards. They are my favorite group!<br />  TOM
B00F5I344G|5.0|Really dig the new album. Much more refined than their other releases, but still great! Where's my mule? Where's my forty acres?
B005544TRQ|5.0|Super predictable endings in each chapter, but it's fun to watch. I'll continue with the following seasons as soon as I can
B00BWJARHO|5.0|It was  a very good movie. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys The Lord of the Rings movies. Thanks
B00BW5K5DO|4.0|Enjoy the building, etc. Not happy that you can only go so far then you have to buy more...:-\<br />They should give you heads up that your can go only so far<br />But so true for most free games, I guess<br />That is sad!<br />But enjoy the free part and start over to do better.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Like the premise behind these kind of logic games. Like Sherlock Holmes says, \\"Once you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.\\" (or something like that)
B0015AARJI|5.0|I'm very satisfied<br />is just what I wanted<br />I highly recommend this product for its quality and price … …
B00CP4RZCU|5.0|This is the best Black Label Society cd I have heard yet.  Very good live recording. I like Zakk W. but some of his songs I do not care for. Have not heard any on this cd. I do not like.  Check this side of Zakk out I think you will enjoy it. I play guitar, I am inpressed. Thank you Zakk for this album I love It.
B00A77II0U|4.0|Wasn't sure if I would like this game since clowns scare the peewading out of me but it was fun, challenging and scary. Good adventure. Challenging without being too difficult. Looks forward to more games from this company.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Really Love it! At the first I thoug that it doesn't work well because I have an Huawei G510 phone, but it surprised me that the game runs very well and it's very fun!<br />Recommended
B000GWE44U|5.0|One of the best horror movies in creation.  An absolute mind bend.  I do not know why it took so long to watch it.  Kubrick and Nicholson....perfect
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|Thank you for this book, Oh Margaret. I'd been waiting, and I don't generally read novels. But yours speak of who we are and what we might become, and I like your insights. I love that you know so much about what we have in our world that is precious-- what is necessary to the human spirit to hold-tightly-- what is dangerous and must be discarded for the sake of all that exists in this interdependent web of existence.<br /><br />I very-much enjoy your humor, Oh Margaret, and am especially fond of the Crakers. Thank you for making me better-acquainted with them in this third book of the series.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This was a history lesson that kept my interest, upstairs or downstairs.  Wonderful story, expert acting, and lovely scenery.<br />The changes after the first World War were many, some difficult, some eagerly embraced.  Lady Edith, Sybil, and Mrs. Crawley were in the forefront of the changes in their part of England.  I can hardly wait for Season 4.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It was hard to put this book down. I kept wondering where we were headed! - I'll definitely try another title by this author.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Good  clean look. Simple but what you need at a glance. Could have improved the app. with options to customizing the color and style of the font and such.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|If you like action and zombies this movie is full of both! Family and love and happy endings and a solution to a horrible outbreak!
B003F3PMYI|3.0|I was as good as those kind of books get. I didn't really learn anything new but it was a enjoyable read.
B00EL8I8IS|3.0|I'm a big fan of apocalyptic movies, and although this one had a unique plot and some good actors, I was somewhat disappointed with how they handled a lot of the details. There were too many parts that were impossible and the climax was a bit far fetch. Brad pit handled his part as best as he could, but some of the others I thought to be terrible. I would give more but don't want any spoilers.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Your basic zombie movie with a bigger budget--the only good things in the movie were some of the special effects.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|Documents To Go Full Version offers a mobile solution for editing MS Office documents. It is compatible with the majority of office documents one will typically encounter. There is not menu on the main screen, offering you a familiar interface and features similar to those found in your  desktop MS Office tools. Instead, most of the document editing features are available via a menu that is activated by your mobile device menu button. This compromise gives the user more real state on the main screen, but forces the user to perform a few more clicks than usual to find the basic features. That makes the interface feel unnatural and hard to get used to, but functional.<br /><br />This product is good for reviewing and editing word documents. I would not recommend it as a tool to write a new document or to write the final version of any document. The limitations of the user interface would make it very difficult to write anything more than the draft version of a document.
B00C2FFJFM|5.0|i never receved these cds i have been waiting on them but never got them.i dont know why they never came in but they didint i have a feeling they were left on my porch and somebody else got them
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob was very good reading, and held my interest throughout.  Landay portrayed the characters very well and made it easy for the ready to empathize with the relationship issues.
B00CQZ65SI|4.0|The book was good except that it promotes soy sauce and canola oil (not good).<br />The book also seemed to disagree a little with the book &#34;Wheat Belly&#34; by Dr. William Davis. I thought Dr. Davis was the one that alerted Djokovic to all this.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|It worked really well for me to clean up  the cache and unneeded files on my sons kindle since it was full
B004X4R3FE|5.0|great movie, very entertaining and moving. great performances by colin firth and geoffrey rush. no slow parts, lots of humor
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I had to completely reset my kindle after even tech support couldn't help. Do NOT download for risk of losing everything and starting from scratch!
B0089LOG02|5.0|This story is a beautiful tapestry weaving the lives of Vivian, a child of The Orphan Trains, and Molly a modern day child in the foster care system together. The skills needed for self-preservation have not changed in 91 years. Fate brought the two main characters together and enriched the tale of lives torn apart.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This could be one of the very best streaming devices on the market today...  It's size is great about this size of a large usb key, you can put just about anywhere and its out of the way.  Needs extra usb power...OK...but all the needed power source and cables are included.  Running two on different brand components one directly into TV other via Reciever controlled by multiple devices running the major OSs with no issues.  BUT...MAJOR problem &#34;Where are the NEW apps?????&#34; so far just the 4 its launched with, play music/video, netflix and youtube which work great.<br /><br />Will be 5 Stars when more apps are supported.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It's a nice game good graphics I like how it tells you how to play a game before you buy it. :)
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I really enjoyed the first half of the book. A \\"Lord of the flies\\" survival tone at the beginning, but then it takes a turn for the worst. It feels like the second half was altered to appeal to the \\"Twilight\\" market. The main character's personality makes an abrupt change in the beginning of the 2nd half. I will not be reading the rest of the series.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Wow this book is amazing to get. I love this book I would recommend this book to my friends. Just love it
B00D3NSDVO|4.0|I Am Pilgrim begins a little slowly and at first I wasn't sure where it was headed. However after a few chapters I couldn't put it down. It was an intense and fascinating insight into security organisations, terrorism and other cultures. Ultimately it was quite a scary and shocking tale. Highly recommended!
B00DXPC1U6|1.0|This whole season has been riddled with bad writting,and many other MAJOR issues that can bug you so badly it haunts you for days on end.  Some of these issues I had with this season were:<br /><br />unfiled court document about cell phone locations of debra and dexter discssed in episode 1 of final season never brought up again afterwords.<br />time wasting musakha's daughter plotlines<br />Hannah kills billionare who was hiding her from authorities only they never discuss his death or anyone looking to find out what happens to him after hannah and dexter take care of his body<br />quinns sargaent exam plotline that has another actor who gets the job instead of him, only we never EVER see that actor again for the rest of the season.  waste of time!<br />Hannah never disguises herself in public even though she's wanted Women<br />Dexter too trusting of hannah after attemping to kill deb last season, and then he request deb to hold hannah in her house, she agrees willingly after all of season 7 and after she poisons the 2 of them this season.<br />one point deb told quinn go back to jamie in one episode right before deb tried to kill dexter and her in a car crash, then out of the blue in a few episodes down deb wants to pick up her relationship with quinn, WHAT!<br />cheap way of dexter not killing saxon and handing him over to debra, deliberatly leaving his blades within arms reach of saxon which he then kills the u.s. marshall with and shoots debra.  Dexter even told debra in a few episodes before this happened that oliver saxon is extremely dangerous, the whole setting up debra to get killed off was so badly written.  this is by far the weakest writing in the entire season that angers me other than debra's character being killed off screen(technically her brain died to failed medical procedure but still shes basically got killed OFF SCREEN!)<br />Dexter becomes a lumberjack, REALYY!!!! he's the new trinity making a hobby/living chopping wood.<br />dexter whole character the last six episodes is just beyond weird and poorly written.  you dont make your character dark for 7 seasons then all the sudden he becomes nicer(even jeff linsey the creator of dexter was upset over this on a reddit AMA, sociopaths can't change).<br />the treadmill scene with harrison is just so bad, it was so obvious with that scene that there was something severely off.<br />I could go on and on about how bad this season was, but i pretty much summed up the major frustration I had with this season, i loved this show so much it was on my number one show of all time. but now after watching this last season im in a state of shock, a final season can ruin an entire show's saga. I wanted so much more out of this season, weak plot points, bad acting at times ruined it, and i don't want to add this in my collection.  I will always remember season 7 as the last good season.
B00ET47USI|2.0|too cutesy for me, too much animation going on, must be for kids, prefer the free version I originally downloaded
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is almost awesome but cool every one should try it for one or more times its actually cool good bye enjoy the game
B00DG292SK|4.0|Pretty detailed. Lots of insight into a very complex and troubled man.  Very much worth the read if you want to get to know Pete Townsend.
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|One of my favorites! It's not some cliche love story movie, it's a movie most people can relate to. The feeling of having a first love. Two amazing actors who play there character too perfectly. This is a must see movie.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|slow at times but unique idea for a story and unexpected results.  You think you have figured it out but then there's a twist.
1451695195|5.0|Regardless what your spiritual leanings, this book is an amazing admission for someone who had no such beliefs beforehand. I give the author credit for honestly relating his miraculous experience as he himself was able to interpret it. As far as the \\"you can do nothing wrong\\" bit - I would think twice about anything that meets you in the clouds and tells you something like that. If nothing we can do is \\"wrong\\" someone please explain the evil done by humans in this world. Perhaps this doctor had some type of experience and perhaps he believes he visited heaven, but being told that nothing you can do is wrong is a stretch for anyone who has ever experienced the thing called conscience. No matter what your beliefs, we all need to contemplate and pray about such things. I recommend Lin Tomasso's book Prayer Warrior: How to Get Your Prayers Answered to help do this correctly. Prayer is a formula, and this book shows how to do it correctly to achieve results. I downloaded it to my laptop (you can download it to any device) for $2.99 at smashwords.com. Tomasso is funny and down to earth, a great read. Apply the basic principles no matter what your belief system. I loved it.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I never hesitate to purchase an episode from Amazon. Good quality & prompt service. Plus The Following is a must see tv series!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|What an inspirational book! A great book for any woman working to balance her career and family life. Loved it!
B004AP9W46|5.0|Great book. Although a fiction based novel, I had to keep reminding myself &#34;it's only fiction/keep an open mind&#34; as the vivid details wrestled and shook several foundations of my Christian belief. Still traveling through Lestat's world and have yet to see what happens next -- Excited!
140006922X|5.0|The author writes clearly and I found it hard to put this book down. I'm a lifelong Christian, with passion for monotheism and ecumenism. I learned a lot and my faith grew. I have recommended this book to many and none tell me anything negative. I also discovered that my church is hosting a book study based on Zealot beginning this November.
B007SGM084|5.0|Love these books! There is more to these books then people first tell you. Great love story really. And all the things they go threw makes you not want to put the books down.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Interesting and engaging, however it needs an interactive help feature. Lastly, the &quot;forced rate&quot; is the only way to continue the game....that I do NOT appreciate and is the reason for a lost star in my rating.
B00CS74W0C|4.0|I can't wait for the next one! This book draws you in and makes you want to know how their relationship will work out.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This is a very engrossing and exciting story. I relish the time I have to read it. I am more than half way through it and can't wait to finish it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the best I could play all day get your going  to  love it and it's totally free
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a fun game for my kids and me and teaches my kids some stuff about taking care of horses until  they decide they want one
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I didn't choose 5 stars only because I was a little disappointed in the ending, otherwise it was a very good story.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I enjoy this game but I often loose credits when the game disconnects me randomly. Also some rooms are much more difficult to finish than others.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I have enjoyed playing this game.  It is very interesting to figure out and keeps you going for sometime.  I will have to find one of their other games to play when I am done.  Their way of creating a game is good.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great story!  Couldn't put it down. Very different from others books I've read even though the &#34;saving the world&#34; idea is the same. Very excited for the movie.
B0013O123Q|5.0|this movie is truly a work of art, not only in the way it's shot, but the reverse chronological storytelling... warning... this movie will most likely make you feel nauseous or dizzy during the first act, so try not to watch after eating... wait about an hour. there are some brutal scenes in this film, what I consider to be, the very best of director Gaspar Noe.
B005HEF8OC|5.0|Can't believe I missed it the first time! Would definitely recommend. Amazon wants me to write more words, so......more words.
B00D2I8E46|5.0|I did not know what to expect when I heard Elvis Costello was doing an album with the Roots.  I did not know much about the Roots, so this was new territory for me.  I have been an Elvis Costello fan for a long time, and I generally prefer the classic sound from his earlier albums over the cross genre projects he has tried over the years.  I almost cancelled my preorder for this album since I was really on the fence.  With all that said, I can tell you that it has grown on me tremendously to the point that I am looking forward to hearing it.  There are only a couple weak songs, but overall, it is an excellent and worthy addition to his catalog.  Only time will tell if this album can remain there for me, but right now I am going to enjoy the album.  The strongest tracks on the album for me are #3&4:  Refuse to be Saved and Wake Me Up.  I do not think you can go wrong with this purchase unless you are only interested in his classic sound.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|its ok... learning the game uses all your tokens and makes it hard for kids to play.  it is fun though
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Get out your notepad, put away the intoxicants and be prepared to stop the movie now and then to digest what you've just seen.  If I had seen this in the theater I would likely have needed to go 2 or 3 times to begin to figure it all out.  Once you've digested what you've seen, it makes the ending much better.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|i just really liked it. i went through all kind of feeling. I enjoyed watching the movie. i remembered all my splendid days when i was pregnant.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|This doesn't happen often; a movie that I could not get ahead on the plot.  I'm big on figuring out what's going to happen next (I can't help it), so when I find a movie that keeps me guessing to the end, and has a reasonable ending, I come away satisfied.  If the movie is well written and the actors do their job, then I'm a fan.<br /><br />While the movie shows you some of the tricks to a degree that allows you to say &#34;Ok, I can definitely see how that works&#34;, they don't explain how the really (in my opinion) interesting tricks work and leave you wondering if perhaps if they are asking you to believe that there is at least just a little real magic in the world.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great movie! Great action! I had only seen Iron Man (which I loved) before I watched The Avengers, but this movie has inspired me to watch all of them.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|I missed this in the theaters but I caught it on Amazon via Tivo.  I loved this movie and can't wait to see the sequel.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Martin's tales of fantasy and fratricide are great fun. Love Danny and her dragons. Tyrion is the best dwarf character since Snow White's crew.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Open .PDF in iPad or simply Kindle .pdf reader is not enough. iBooks fails in the most pdf files I wanted to highlight text. Adobe reader does its job, it works.
B009LDCZDC|5.0|could not wait to rent on net flicks ..<br /> this is a must see<br />it gets better every episode<br /><br />order it now !
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wow. Thanks for this book. It bought out lots of emotions and kept my attention.  I can't wait to read more of your books. I love the twists and kepted up with the flipping .
B004GJYRG4|4.0|Was as expected and described- timely shipment.  As always, package was complete.  Price was very competitive, as always.  Would recommend buying dvds here
B003G4W49C|4.0|Overall a good book. Nothing to complain about. I started to lose interest toward the end, but maybe I just didn't read it fast enough.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I have a theory that if I start a book and don't like it I should finish it for the sake of the author.  I rarely deviate from this but this book was the exception. I pushed myself to get halfway through before I quit.  I loved Heaven is for Real so I thought I'd likes this book.  Wrong!  I couldn't get past this guy 's lack of humility.  The book seemed to ramble on and on with nothing for the reader to take away.  Very disappointing - I couldn't recommend it to anyone.
0345548981|5.0|Useful advice from one of the world's best tennis player. Not just on diet, but much more!<br /><br />You'll enjoy this for the useful content and for the Djoker's funny quotes. Will definitely try his suggestions! Would recommend to everyone and especially to athletes!
034544678X|5.0|It. Is. Amazing. Warning: Gushy post ahead, I can't say enough good about this book!<br /><br />I feel like it's revolutionizing my relationship with Cassie (13 yr. old border collie-x)!  This author is engaging and so informative. She backs up her claims with well rounded research and anecdotal stories. She gives clear suggestions for interacting with dogs.  Best of all, every time she makes a suggestion, I put down my book and notes and give it a try with Cassie.  So far, we've had amazing success!<br /><br />Here are two examples.....one, Cassie has a little obedience routine that we practice including her COME, SIT, STAY, DOWN. She generally listens well (to me) and performs correctly about 75% of the time. After analyzing my actions, words, and the results, I realized that I was not being consistent. My smart little pup has figured out what I want most of the time, but eventually she gets confused and wanders away or comes and sits down beside me ending our session.  When I employed Dr. McConnell's suggestions however, she was performing at 100%!  wow!<br /><br />Even better, Cassie has never listened well to Cole (my husband). We thought it was because she preferred me...she always seems to look at me when he says something and then generally doesn't obey him. I have learned that the inconsistencies are just multiplied tenfold when dealing with Cole because she never managed to decipher his mix of signals....and perhaps she doesn't care enough to try really hard - her goal in life is to please me.  I had him run through the same routines I was doing and she listened better than ever before with him!  Furthermore, we tried to get him to call her away from my side  (a tall order for my shadow), he executed the move perfectly, and Cassie trotted over immediately without even looking to me for guidance!  Our poor girl has just been confused for all these years.<br /><br />I'm taking lots of notes and practicing with Cassie in hopes that we can give Mica the consistency and clear communication that he'll need. I hope that he'll be even more receptive because he hasn't spent years reading my crazy human signals like poor Cass.<br /><br />We feel more confident and in control which is thrilling after being so nervous about bringing Mica (our new rescue) home. Cole too is feeling stronger and ready to tackle this challenge!tency and clear communication that he'll need. I hope that he'll be even more receptive because he hasn't spent years reading my crazy human signals like poor Cass.<br /><br />We feel more confident and in control which is thrilling after being so nervous about bringing Mica (our new rescue) home. Cole too is feeling stronger and ready to tackle this challenge!
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Zombies on speed running rabid around the world. Brad Pitt must save the day... BUT CAN HE?! Watch and find out ... or don't?!
B0049J2BSM|5.0|We loved this movie and we're able to have  a great family night....perfect for all ages even our two year old loved it
B002BBJ52U|3.0|This was billed as a comedy. I found the stories compelling. However, the situations that the characters found themselves in were just sad and pathetic, not at all funny to me. It's certainly worth the time to watch, but it won't get you laughing.
B00DHSK3RM|4.0|It is fun but frustrating at the same time. Great way to pass some time. You will be amazed how many of your friends play too.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It was a great book! Kept me interested until the end! Lots of twists and turns in this great book!
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|A lot of fun. Really tests your response time and dexterity. Have still to figure out how to make the jumps last longer and ducking under branches can be a challenge. My children are much better at this than I am.
B0088W4YTK|5.0|Good sci fi is harder to find these days, its all vampires and zombies. Thanks for keeping these shows available
B0026PW67W|5.0|Great transaction, item as described and arrived quickly. It was a big hit for the HP nerd! Great seller, would use again
B00B3EJ292|5.0|This was a beautiful story. Wish it was in English so I could fully enjoy watching the movie instead of trying to keep up with the written words.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|Wonder how many women put their two-cents in on \\"World War Z\\"? Probably not too many. I am female, late-twenties and my idea of some good \\"scary\\" movies are \\"Jurassic Park\\" and \\"Deep Impact...(try not to eye roll.) Thrilling, gives you some chills, but doesn't leave you staring at your ceiling at night trying to translate if the popping sound of the ice maker is actually an intruder fixing to slay your family. Get me, ladies? Oh, and I 'used' to think zombies were extremely lame.<br /><br />The Unrated version of WWZ is significantly more graphic than the version I saw in the theater, but certainly nothing I couldn't handle. A few heavy cringes...that's all. However, it literally grabs you and doesn't let go. The large segment in the lab, is one of the more thrilling movie scenes I have ever endured. It is crazy good. I thought Gerry Lane was a touching, smart, and pretty bad-a** character and his love for his family was a beautiful part of the film. I am certainly no movie critic and am not judging on authenticity from the book, but from a woman's perspective this one shouldn't be missed!
B00C3MKCIS|5.0|I just got this one and I  already know on first listen that Dimensionaut will be on my list of top notch prog albums.  This is a tremendously fantastic debut.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Cannot wait for the movies to come out!  This trilogy is great, but not for the faint of heart!  Not just &#34;smut&#34; either, great story line for sure!
B0042RJWTM|5.0|LEE MARVIN AT HIS BEST! ENJOYABLE FILM. WATCH OUT FOR COOK GETTING HIS REVENGE FOR THE BATH HE WAS GIVEN!
B005MMJ84K|5.0|If you loved the Hunger Games, you will love this one too!  Great book series for sure, worth every penny!
B008IBPMZG|5.0|It took a bit to get going in the first season, but now with the character development so great it is difficult to stop watching.  We went through season 2 so quickly because it was just so good!
B000N2HCKQ|5.0|Great revelations about why people give their interest to something.  The Heath bothers present the information is such a way that is easy to understand and remember.  I've enjoyed all their books.
0142418471|4.0|My son wanted this book and had been requesting it for a while.  I bought it and he loved it.  I read it recently, while it is not necessarily something I enjoyed reading, it had the requisite teen angst that my kid could relate to (and that I recognized that he could relate to).  A good read for a teenage boy (14+).
B003B02O0U|4.0|This book is full of suspense, action and intrigue. From the assassination of two Supreme Court justices to a young beautiful and brilliant law student, Grisham weaves a tale of murder and political corruption you'll not want to put down. This is a very good book that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the end.
B00BWJ91XK|5.0|IF YOU HAVE READ THE HOBBIT DON'T WORRY THAT SHOULDN'T RUN YOUR FUN WITH THIS MOVIE.<br /><br />MAN AS SOON AS THE QUEST STARTED IT WAS ONE TRAVESTY AFTER THE OTHER. NOW I KNOW IT COULD BE TIRING AFTER AWHILE, BUT FOR NERDS AND GEEKS, WE LOVED IT!<br /><br />I RECOMMEND IF YOUR A SELF PROCLAIMED GEEK OR NERD WATCH THIS MOVIE.
B00CK8CLFW|5.0|I purchased this book last year (hard cover) and used it to mold a figurine out of modeling chocolate and fondant (I am a cake artist).  Following the steps provided, I was able to create an edible figurine for a client.  She was completely blown away by its likeness and she told me she was going to keep it as long as she possibly can.  I look forward to creating many more figurines in the future.
0060936223|5.0|Fantastic book for the poetic minded, but also for the rock n' roll enthusiast!  Contains some objectionable material that a few students had a difficult time relating to.  Most of us loved it!
B00CU8OVIM|3.0|It's a chore to sit through the entire album. It shouldn't feel that way, since I've been listening to Cole for quite some time now. Honestly, I prefer his mix tapes over his retail releases.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Fluid lyrics and rhythms make listening to this cd easy. Not always a huge rap dab but this is awesome!
B00CV5ZPA2|2.0|I respect Kanye for releasing this album. I just don't like it. There's only 1 or 2 songs I enjoy to say the least. I am a God and the last song. I haven't listened to this album in over 2 months and I'm not sure If I want to break that streak just yet.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I liked it since the beginning. All the characters cross the others at some point , their lives tied by long kept secrets, and doubts. And then changed forever. I tried to read it at any time I could. Just wanted to know what happened next.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Candy crush saga has nothing on this game!! Once you get started you can't stop. Love love love it!!!! Not enough hrs in the day it's sooo hard to put down. This is a must have adventure
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|This game is awesome, especially with the recent updates. I wish you could use tanks and artillery though, and have more freedom like CoD, but it is still the best app I have for my Kindle
B00594XOZU|3.0|I accidentally uninstalled this app and now that I reinstalled it won't log in it keeps saying &quot;taking to long to log in try again later&quot; :( some one help please!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Have you ever wondered; if you did one thing differently, would it change your life? Cecilia Fitzpatrick, a smart, energetic mother and wife, with three lovely daughters, has stumbled upon an envelope. Written on the outside, in her husband's handwriting, are the words `to be read only after my death'. She is gob smacked, to say the least. Should she open it? Her husband is away on a business trip but curiosity is getting the best of her!<br /><br />Rachel Crowley, a dedicated grandmother, is experiencing an emotional quandary. Her son and daughter-in-law are moving to another country, which involves uprooting their little boy, Rachel's adorable grandson. She loves him so much! How can they do this to her? Her innermost thoughts are overflowing, like a tidal wave, into her everyday life. Other unendurable events from her past threaten her emotions as well. It is getting to be too much for her. How will she cope with it all?<br /><br />Tess O'Leary, a modest lady, is part owner of a business with her husband and her cousin, who is also her best friend. Tess is hiding a secret. This secret is all encompassing. She has not told her husband or her cousin. The secret is a part of her life. She is ready to burst! She has to tell someone!<br /><br />One little envelope with a letter inside will set into motion a chain of events. Three separate families. Their lives will be touched. Their lives will be changed. They will all be brought together...by one little letter.<br /><br />THE HUSBAND'S SECRET is a cagey, introspective and intelligent novel. There are always two sides to every coin or, er, story. Secrets are fun to share but sometimes you really should keep your mouth shut. These two phrases fit this story completely, so I won't say more. You won't believe all the ramifications that one written letter will muster. The whole lot of characters and families, quirky and otherwise, completely round out this baffling plot. I found myself going back and rereading passages because I didn't want to miss anything. It is fantastic how the author, Liane Moriarty, wound the plot tight and tighter. I couldn't put the book down! I kept trying to figure out all the possible connections, but I wasn't able to. Ms. Moriarty leaves all the vital details until the very end! You will not be disappointed. The ending or rather the epilogue is very startling and very unorthodox. I didn't see that coming sums it up quite nicely! THE HUSBAND'S SECRET is uniquely unusual with sparks of deceit, brilliance and flair. Rock on, Ms. Moriarty!

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The Husband's Secret was a surprise for me. I can typically predict the plot lines of most books that I read but this one kept me guessing.  This was a really great read!!
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|As with science and metaphysics, history is a method of inquiry that arises because human beings ask questions. Christians, Jews, and Muslims are summoning everyone to believe in life after death, and this book sheds light on that question. Aslan says the Resurrection of Jesus occurred three days after his crucifixion by Roman soldiers in 30 CE. My understanding is that historians can trace the Resurrection of Jesus only to within a few years of his death. The Resurrection of Jesus is also called the Easter experience, and refers to the renewed fellowship of Jesus' disciples after they scattered in fear and shock. It is both an historical event and an object of faith.<br /><br />Aslan confirms that Jesus was an exorcist and healer. He makes the historicity of this clear by pointing out that Jesus did not charge for his services, unlike other exorcists and healers of his day. He also confirms that Jesus was a popular preacher, and that his disciples founded the Catholic Church with Peter, James, and Paul being the initial leaders of the organization.<br /><br />Aslan also confirms that Jesus preached the coming of the kingdom of God, but he has his own ideas about what this meant. The meaning of this is relevant to a decision about what religion to follow. I don't think the meaning of this has any relevance to the more general and more important question. What is relevant to this question is that the Bible says in Exodus 3.14 that God's name is \\"Yahweh\\" in Hebrew.<br /><br />\\"Yahweh\\" is translated into Greek and English as \\"I am who am.\\" Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century explained that God is a pure act of existence. A finite being has an existence limited by its essence. This is evidence that God inspired the human authors of the Bible because Jewish people at that time did not comprehend the meaning of the Exodus passage. Another sign that God inspired the Jewish people is that by the time of Jesus, Jewish people believed in life after death.<br /><br />Another reason to believe our freedom is before God is an historical artifact: the Shroud of Turin. Within decades after Jesus' death, documents said that Jesus was beaten, tortured with a thorn-cap, and stabbed in the side. In addition, these documents say he was put in a separate tomb with a linen burial cloth. The Shroud of Turin tells this same story of the death and burial of Jesus with the blood marks and body image on a linen cloth, front and back. According to [[ASIN:0847673499 In Search of the Shroud of Turin: New Light on Its History and Origins]] by Robert Drews, a group of unorthodox Christians created the relic in the 1st or 2nd century using a crucified victim to create the blood marks. The method used to create the body image has been lost to time. Many Christians believe the mysterious image was created miraculously 3 days after Jesus died.<br /><br />The Catholic Church achieved political power in the 4th century, and gave mankind Western civilization. When the Catholic Church lost some of its political influence in the 18th century, the wars and genocide of the 19th and 20th century followed.ason to believe our freedom is before God is an historical artifact: the Shroud of Turin.

B001LA3JWY|1.0|I ordered this for a college project I had coming up. The price was perfect and figured I could sale it or give it to the next upcoming students in the class. WRONG! I paid for it and it was sent. EVERYTHING was going well and then I get an e-mail from them asking me if I enjoyed the product (which I found a little strange for I never gotten anything like this before when purchasing from amazon) in which I responded &#34; I never have gotten it in the mail&#34; The good thing was and I was happy about is they refunded my purchase price plus shipping. That I am happy for, but I have never had a problem with anything on amazon before. But, I'm very happy how they handled the issue.

B008VIKLWA|4.0|Some of my thoughts, after seeing this film multiple times, and reading many of the critical reviews here on Amazon:<br /><br />It took four years to make this film.  It isn't easy to follow wild chimps through dense and remote rain forest, nor is it an easy matter to acquire good, clear footage without getting too close.  I readily admit I wish some things had been done differently in the making of 'Chimpanzee'.  (Things like the narration script and some of the editing.)  That said, it contains some of the best play, grooming, and tool usage footage to be found anywhere.  The footage of well coordinated hunting is amazing, impressive, and not something often seen at length in most great ape documentaries.<br /><br />The single most important accomplishment of this film, in my opinion, is that it is impossible for any thinking individual to come away from seeing without realizing that chimps are extremely intelligent with complex social structure.  Their DNA is 98.6% identical to our own - no wonder they seem so very 'human' at times....And that includes the good, the bad, and the ugly...You know, things like rejecting a young beggar because you have your own kids to feed, making war over turf and resources, strong family bonds, the joy of play, and the politics of power. If, like reviewer 'Scott', you are offended by your young relatives seeing reality, if hunting for meat offends you, then you would be well served to go rent \\"Lion Kink' instead.<br /><br />Those critical of the story line should perhaps keep in mind that while adoption of orphans (or the infants of inept or negligent mothers) is not unheard of among chimpanzees. It is also true infant mortality among chimpanzees is significant, especially when a mother is killed, injured, or ill.  One thing not mentioned, which I believe should have been, is that 'Freddie' and 'Oscar' are more than likely close blood relatives.  Even at that, a male chimp adopting/fostering is definitely NOT the norm, let alone areigning alpha doing so. That alone makes this a rather remarkable film. Something that is brought out in the 'making of' featurette is that Oscar being orphaned was unexpected, and until the alpha male adopted him, the future of the film was in question.
