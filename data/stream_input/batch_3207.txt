1616202416|4.0|This engaging tale of a family's conflicts parallels the story of revolution and national conflict in Nigeria. At times it is heartbreaking. I love the book and rated it 4 stars only because I think the author's &#34;Half of a Yellow Sun&#34; is even better. Even if you are not interested in the political events, the story of a family dominated by a kind of monster will move you.
B004VDSWQ6|5.0|Really well done. A/V quality is excellent, & editing isn't too frenetic. Ronnie was one of rock's greatest singers, & when together with Butler & Iommi you get a bit of magic happening. Very enjoyable.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Good game great time to get it free love the way it plays can't wait to get superman and red son pack
B00ENTDDGW|5.0|I love the colors and its fun to play. it is almost like a real game only a smaller version.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Would be nice if you could upgrade app to chose &quot;current location&quot;. I like all of the other applications, especially current conditions.
B000683VI4|5.0|I loved this movie.  It has so many good parts in it and the actors are amazing.  It's a must have movie.
B003PBB4ME|3.0|works with motication but it does work with the unit that i used with lights,  work work work work only because you need more words
B004UID2LC|4.0|I love what you can look up on this site.  It has so much to offer .  I think it's worth checking out.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is a great game that makes you think about the &quot;what if's&quot;, and shows how easily it could happen.  I love how you can manipulate the DNA to make it more difficult for a cure to be discovered.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I really didn't care for this game, I thought it was a little confusing to figure out and to play
B00571F26Y|1.0|A lot of hype for things we already know.  You can find out everything you need to know on this subject just by Googling it.
B00GINENG0|5.0|He is fun to play and you can feed him, talk on the phone with him and do other things .
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|Thanks to some egotistic music critics this music gets labeled something it's not along with Miguel, the Weeknd, and how to dress well. These critics just wish to be recognized for creating something new. This music is it's own. Soulful, alive. This album deserves better attention than some indie hipster punk wannabe music critic that wants attention. Channel Orange is a work of art, enjoyed for what it is.good vocals, good atmosphere, good songwriting. Just because he's black and doesn't dress like a gangster doesn't mean he's a indie hipster. Listen to the music and stop labeling it a bunch of ridiculous crxx!
0316204366|3.0|You’ll have to forgive Gladwell’s dodgy statistics and research methods but David and Goliath is a well-presented entertaining read even if it might not teach you much.<br /><br />Follow link for full review: [...]
B009JZPH32|5.0|This is a fun movie full of guilty pleasure and degenerates. It explores the full spectrum of stereotypical freaks: hippies,sexy dumb blondes, military badasses, corrupt officials, pot heads, Mexican drug lords, Mexican women,nerds and more. This is very much an action movie of cat and mouse, who's gonna outwit who back and forth. There's lots of color, sex, drugs, violence, bad script and bad acting, psychedelic choreography/editing. I'm not comparing it against the book or other Oliver stone movies. Just comparing it against other drug/action movies. And this is one fun ride! If not a long one too!
B00005LOUP|4.0|I love this movie. A must see for every Christmas season.  The quality of the disc es very good. I'm very happy with this buy.
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|Gone are the over production, over polished and over layered sting albums, gone is the pop driven sting. This one is striped down to the bare acoustic bones of sting, great vocals, great stories, beautiful arrangements, moody atmospheric humbleness of just what sting needs. It carries a very organic folk feel to it, full of soul, life, wisdom, integrity. It's like a response to his own over produced albums. His soul finally matches his music. The introspection is heavy, sting shines like he always had but even brighter! He's returning to his folk roots. We the audience have grown and matured with sting, appreciating his every step. His vocals are in tact, every bit strong as it was 20 years ago.Everything returns full circle, nature and humbleness takes precedence. Wisdom and time grow immortal, beauty and love are in the air. Cold fog sets the mood, the candle reminds us we're still human. Everything is in place, life is complete.

B00004Z400|5.0|Perhaps deftones best album! Lots of moodiness, atmosphere, creativity. This album feels totally inspired and full of energy. One of the best metal bands out there. The vocals are really creative, loud too!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Great app. Has many challenges and bosses, also there is a large variety of armor. The game starts slow then the farther you go it gets progressively faster.
B00328G4V6|4.0|This is a must buy for the jimi completist. These recordings never get old, they are eternal, they are worth their place in every rock fans collection
B00062PN6I|2.0|For the price I was expecting ho-hum and got a headset that rivals headsets I paid a hundred dollars for. The above was true until they just flat fell apart and ended up in the trash.
B000002P5R|3.0|Great jimi recording but it doesn't really stand out as much as some of his other recordings. There are some really great tracks, it is a must have for jimi completist
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Love Facebook, don't use it much. I just keep up with what family and friends are doing. Do not interact much.
B003ZSH606|4.0|This is a feel good cd, I love it. A bit different from his other stuff but still good, feel good, upbeat, accessible , fun, danceable and more

0810983915|5.0|My 9-year-old read this in 1 sitting.  He loves this series and he enjoyed this one just as much as the others.  It's well worth the money to me to encourage my kid to read as much as he can, and this is a fun way to do that.  I've bought him other age-appropriate books, even humorous books, but he's never enjoyed any of them as much as these Diary of a Wimpy kid books.
B0048WQDIE|5.0|The ultimate anti-war book...Major Major Major Major substory is just too funny...as is the trial discussing what was NOT said...:)
B00CBR9NIA|4.0|It was a very enjoyable movie. We enjoyed it very much. Learned a lot about the behind the scenes of Psycho.

B0081ISUOG|5.0|Best in its class. Versatile and easy to use. Especially valuable: the ability to set multiple timers and LABEL THEM so you don't get confused when they go off at different times!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is fun but it takes a long time to download so if you have the patience thin stop reading the review and download injustice gods among us.
0316067601|4.0|Awesome first-person narrative from the individual point of view!  Well written and descriptive work brings the reader into combat.  Highly recommendede
B0083GQKQG|5.0|What makes people do what they do? In this story a child is devilishly sinister towards it's mother; yet totally opposite to the father and his sister. It was very sad to watch.
B009CG8EOM|3.0|This was a more interesting and darker adaptation of Snow White. We were truly entertained by the movie and will probably watch it again.
B000I9WW3G|5.0|An amazing person with an amazing story to tell. You can find the actual Erin at her Law Firm company site. It gives a nice run down of herself and her comments in the roll of this film. I give this a thumbs way up!<br /><br />&#34;The power of money has the power to trump all that is good.&#34; -C. S. Lewis
B00A23MVHA|4.0|Really funny movie for adults, animating a bear and having it doing drugs  + engaging in sex had a morbidly humorous twist. You will never look at a bear the same again, or eat a parsnip....
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|The photography is great. Like the old saying: &#34;A picture tells a thousand stories&#34;. This book tells it all. Most of the pictures grab you with interest and appeal. The stories are interesting and heart warming. The book is wonderful. Thank you.
B0052OSTOS|5.0|I love this app... It actually helps me to sleep. It helps me to wind  down and relax, which is usually hard  for me to do.
B009E9R2OK|1.0|This is a terrible recording, surprised considering who make the disc.  I have a much better than average sound system(Integra,PSB,OPPP).  Also the disc skips

B000VK6MNI|2.0|When &#34;I Thank You For Smoking&#34; first came out I figured it might be an interesting movie. I recently bought this movie at the flea market and so I finally watched it. Personally I kept waiting for this movie to amount to something. This movie is all about the perspective of a guy selling people on the idea of something. The movie is simply a reminder that a person has the final say, a choice, in whether or not smoke, or to do crack, or to kill people for fun. The movie is all about not killing say cigs or guns, or whatnot and letting people choose for themselves instead of say the government. The movie is about the right to SELL something without it being outlawed by BIG BROTHER, the GOVERNMENT. So to sum it up, the movie is boring and a waste of time in case you haven't ever thought about this sort of issue. I kept waiting for some new idea, for something interesting. The movie for me was just a waste of time.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|I never considered myself a good conversation starter in a crowd of strangers until I read this book. Full of common sense, easy to use techniques along with confidence builders. It's not rocket science, easy to do.
B005HF0BIE|5.0|Excellent depiction of King Henry the IV of England. Highly recommended to watch Season 1 Episode 1 through Season 4 Episode 10, because the story builds upon the previous episodes.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I'm thoroughly enjoying  watching the Columbo episodes.  What today's TV dramas lack, the Columbo series has, and that is great plots and story, making it very believable.  The current police/detective shows depend on computer graphics to keep their ratings, but the shows of the 70's and 80's had to depend on a great storyline, and that is what Columbo has.  If you want to watch a show with a great story line and is believable (it won't have all the flashy special effects), then this is for you.
B005HF0B34|5.0|Excellent depiction of King Henry the IV of England. Highly recommended to watch Season 1 Episode 1 through Season 4 Episode 10, because the story builds upon the previous episodes.
0805047905|5.0|My son is on book 10 in the last 3 years. He loves it so much he is unwilling to put it down. He is a 3 year old autistic boy who is obsessed with brown bear and it's helped him in his attempt to speak. Our therapists use it regularly to motivate him.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is cool because the mega minion can crush other minions, you can collect bananas and tokens and dodge obstacles.
B005544TRQ|5.0|A very enjoyable Series, acting is wonderful, storyline is realistic of a big city legal firm, can't wait to see the next disc.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Everything by this author is so gripping! Highly recommend any book he has written as they are all page turners and he keeps his readers interested!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The family loves it it's fun to play can't put it down it's a great game need more ways to get coins
B0036S4B6M|5.0|The writer explained her situation in such a way that moved the reader, I don't typically like reading books like this but she did an incredible job! I highly recommend everyone read this book!
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|Better than the first, more options, hero's and abilities. Please KEEP THEM COMING! I can't give this more than a 5 star rating.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Way too fast for a slow person like me.  I can't keep up with it.  Great graphics I would say.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Lots-o-fun best hunting game ever everyone who likes to shoot things should check it out:) if your a vegan u might not want to download
B0086700CM|2.0|Too fast for me.  I like games that are much slower paced.  The graphics are the best part of the game
B002QVZ71I|5.0|Classic movie that is worth watching more than one time. Some of the lines will be remembered and used for many years such as &#34;Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you are going get
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I could not figure out how it works.  I clicked on all of the pictures in the first level but nothing ever happened.  There are no instructions.  I deleted the app immediately.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|It's a good fps for the kindle fire but you have to play as the bad guy which is something i didn't like but all in all it is a good game i would recommend it to lots of people
B00E00OGE2|5.0|We loved this movie it made the hole family, We thought the whole movie was great .Hope they make Turbo 2
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Lot's of fun when you need a break from work.  Gives my brain a little jolt of energy when I'm tired or down
B00AG297GK|4.0|Silly, with no redeeming social value.  Opposite of intellectual thriller. Slapstick and obvious sophomoric attempt at humor.  Reminds me that most people like to think themselves as politically correct.  Sometimes you have to take the stick out of your a_ _ and watching a bit of drivel such as this reminds yourself that there are morons that view the world differently than yourself.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follet is one of my favorite authors.  This book is so hard to put down.  His character development is peerless and I look forward to purchasing the second book of his trilogy
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|The modern version of a Clint Eastwood, good/bad guy cleans out the really bad guys and citizens are caught in the middle as cannon fodder. I can't remember ever seeing a female cast as a villain leader. Wish they had a little more back story for that character.  Also wish this movie had done better at the box office, because the next movie might have been able to flesh out all the character's back stories instead of relying on them filling an archetype.<br />.
B0074YVW1G|4.0|As an introvert, I must say that Susan Cain really hit the nail on the head with this book!  I've been sharing it with the extroverts in my life... mainly so that they'd leave me alone.
B00CFITJKW|1.0|Peace of junk! Who charges money for this experimental type of software? The graphics are horrible, controls - unintuitive.<br />In the world of amazing simulators, this is a total shame.<br />I really want my money back.
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|After hearing the author speak at a conference, I picked up this book to learn more. It provided me really valuable insights on personal interaction challenges I've had in my career and useful tools that I was I'd had.  A very worthwhile read.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|so I have played this on facebook from a computer so I got this app. for my kindle and was really surprised that it plays to well. I have used other apps for facebook games and usually they don't play right or cause my kindle to freeze up but I don't have the problem with this game at all.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I love this series.  My daughters tried to get me to watch it while it was actually on but that never works for me when I have to be in a certain place at a certain time week after week after week
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is great for practice for you to ride you to run your own business and helps kids read a little.
159668139X|5.0|This book saved me a lot of time and money. I had YouTube pages marked, searched for books and websites to help me understand 4 harness weaving, warping, everything to develop a clear understanding of every part of weaving on my loom so that I could solve any 'opportunities for learning' that might arise. I was not able to find everything in one place, until this book.<br /><br />She takes you very clearly through the parts of the loom, using a warping board, warping front to back, back to front, different tie ups, tabby, twill, overshot, summer, winter, etc.  She does much of this in the form of lessons.<br /><br />This book has built my knowledge and my confidence. This is a must have for anyone using a floor loom.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This is just classic Black Sabbath all the way.  Fantastic work for a bunch of old guys.  The CD is recorded too hot, but it is Black Sabbath, so go figure. This is a rocker!
B001DPHDCY|5.0|My kids love it and it arrived on time. Bought it at a very cheap price and I am so happy I found the deal.
B000244EMO|5.0|The price was absolutely right, I'm a huge fan.

There is a discussion from Arnold of a practical joke he played on Jesse Ventura aka Sgt &#34;Blane&#34; regarding their arm size that is priceless.

0812550706|5.0|I have heard no other book more often cited as a favorite novel, by both young and old. In the military it is read not only because it is an exciting, thought-provoking book but because it teaches strategy and loyalty. Hard to put down. Reread it every few years.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Wonderful acting and singing. Love the music. This is a specular movie event to be enjoyed by all. Hugh Jackman was great.
B000I9U8VO|4.0|\\"Something's happening in the food court.\\" Yeah Mutant revenge smoking and passive aggressive cigarette lighter horseplay Our our favorite Mutants turn up in this sequel to 2000's X-Men as Nightcrawler turns up to set back Human/Mutant relations decades by attempting to assassinate the President. Rogue continues to try to kiss her icy boyfriend.  Fed up with Chess matches with Proffessor X,  Magneto plans to escape his plastic prison via an oversexed inebriated iron-fortified security guy and a sexy blue faux senator, meanwhile the Mutant school is under siege and if theres still time Wolverine may just learn some about his secret origin too
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I enjoy the Downton Abbey series very much. Looking forward to seeing season 4. Hopeful that we will have more English, Irish and Scotchish series And Movies to view.
030759565X|5.0|This is my absolute favorite cookbook of all time. Deb's recipes are meticulously tested and eminently reproducible, leading to delicious results from every recipe I've tried. I fully intend to make every recipe eventually, since they are so reliable and always come out delicious. Whether you are a vegetarian or meat eater, there is plenty inside for you. The book is beautiful and usable, and I think it deserves a spot in every kitchen.

0984380213|4.0|It seems like all anyone in the marketing profession is talking about these days is inbound marketing.  But after reading Predictable Revenue you can't help but start to become a believer in the importance of outbound marketing approaches once again.  The authors outline a factory-style model for manufacturing a consistent pipeline of new leads.  And they introduce an approach that avoids the pushy, aggressive, salesy approach that buyers hate and proactively avoid.<br /><br />Ross and Tyler share hundreds of real-world, practical recommendations on how to generate a predictable pipeline of leads for the sales organization.  Topics covered include how to define an ideal customer profile; best practices for sending emails; and a fundamentally different approach to cold calling.<br /><br />Without question my favorite part of the book was the first chapter which started by explaining the biggest misconception in modern, effective sales - that adding sales people is what grows revenue.  The authors explain how in &#34;high-productivity sales organizations, sales people do not cause customer acquisition growth, they fulfill it.  Of course, you need more sales people if you're getting bigger, but they are not what is causing the bulk of new customer growth....Lead Generation causes new customer<br />acquisition.&#34; Powerful statements that could not be more true!

I graduated from high school in 1959 and my husband did in 1955. It was a great time to be in high school at that time. Buy it, you'll like it!!! I don't care for Grease 2 as much.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|I finished this book last week and have been waiting to write a review so I could figure out what I wanted to say. II'd like to start out by saying that I loved the first two books and could not wait to read the third. I don't feel that this book is anything like the first two. To be honest I feel like Ms. Roth rushed through the book to get it done before the movie - if this book is adapted into the movie the whole script will need to be rewritten.<br /><br />**Spoilers ahead**<br /><br />1) Wtf happened to Tobias? I'm pretty sure he got his period in this book because all he did was whine and cry the whole time. He was so emotional. \\"I hate my parents, I love my parents, I need to rest their memory\\" Whatever.<br />2) There was NO narration separation. Half the time I couldn't remember whose point of view I was reading. So either Tobias speaks like a 16 year old girl or Tris speaks like a man. I'm not sure.<br />3) I feel like The Fringe was pointless and just there to create more pages for the book.<br />4) This is a book where no good guy wins. The bad guys have their memories reset which is fine because 'they can't remember that they're bad.'<br />5) Tris died. Which, isn't what bothers me. I don't think everyone needs to live in every book ever written. But I felt like her death made no sense and I honestly was confused when she died. I had to reread the scene. Pretty sure Ms. Roth was trying to have the same wow factor Mocking Jay did.<br />6) After all that fighting Marcus and Evelyn just give in? WHAT!? \\"Ok Tobias, I'll do it for you even though I left you when you were a kid without a second thought and I've been killing people you care about.\\" \\"Ok Evelyn, I'll just leave and never come back because you asked me to even though I've been portrayed as someone who has no reason and doesn't take crap from anyone. Peace out.\\" Makes. No. Sense.<br />7) The whole reasoning for the Factions and the city made no sense to me and was really confusing at times. Why would two people with 'damaged genes' reproduce people who have 'pure genes'?<br /><br />In the end the book left me unsatisfied and disappointed. Even a little mad. I would suggest you just stop at the second book that way the series can end how ever you want it to and it won't be ruined by the third book.ld two people with 'damaged genes' reproduce people who have 'pure genes'?<br /><br />In the end the book left me unsatisfied and disappointed.

0345530578|5.0|After writing a decade's worth of subpar books, Grisham finally hit his stride again with this one.  It reads like a modern day &#34;Shawshank Redemption&#34;.  Reminiscent  of his great book of the 90's, this one is impossible to put down.  If you like Grisham and are looking for a page turner, this will certainly satisfy.  Hopefully, he has fired his ghost writers, or keeps the one that helped with this novel.

B0060D196K|4.0|Excellent portrayal of Dicken's classic although some parts were understandably goofy for the benefit of the youngest viewers. I use it in the classroom every year and lead up to a 6 paragraph essay for my 7th graders.
006202406X|4.0|I probably need to say that this review will probably be a jumbled mess. Bear with me please. I don't normally feel the need to state this, but with all of the controversy surrounding this book, I want to make sure you know this review is spoiler free.<br /><br />I’m sure you all have seen tons of press about Allegiant. This was probably the most anticipated book of the year for most people. It definitely was for me. So I’m sure you saw the Allegiant countdown widgets on everyone’s blogs. I’m sure you saw dozens of Waiting on Wednesday posts about this. There was a mishap with some supplier somewhere and some people got copies super early, which means spoilers were leaked. And then release date finally came. Now normally, I go to my local book store and pick up books that I’m highly anticipating so that I can have them on release day, but the last one I bought was almost half price on Amazon compared to my local book store on release day. (Yeah, yeah, Amazon’s the devil. Well not to me. I heart Amazon.) And so this time I preordered Allegiant through Amazon instead of picking it up on release day. This meant that tons of people got their hands on Allegiant a couple of days before me. Enough time for spoilers to begin amassing, comments to begin piling up, and opinions began to be formed.<br /><br />And well, I say all of that to say that I was extremely nervous going in to Allegiant. I’m not normally one of those people who dreads reading the last book in a series just in case it doesn’t go the way I want it to. I’m more of the type that dives in head first because I can’t wait to experience it whether good or bad. But all of the hype and comments had me stressed to the max about this book. Let me be clear, I didn’t read any spoilers, but I did read some where others had read spoilers and based off the spoilers decided not to even pick up the book. All of this buzz and conflict had me a bundle of nerves. (Didn’t help that I was already having some anxiety over some real life things as well.)<br /><br />Ultimately I picked up and finished Allegiant. The beginning was going just fine. I wondered to myself “what are all of these people complaining about?” And then I hit the middle and I started getting frustrated with these characters *clears throat and cuts eyes* (**FOUR!!!!!). I really wanted to pop them him over the head. And I don’t know if it was the negative hype, my personal frustrations with characters making some really dumb decisions especially when those characters are supposed to be smart, or if it was my general anxiety, but during this part of the book, I really just wanted to throw the thing across the room. The ending wasn't the part that frustrated me the most. It was the middle. But nevertheless, I moved passed the frustrating middle business and things got better for me. And then the ending happened. I probably would have been frustrated with it had I not been warned that many people hated it, and therefore I lowered my expectations. But the ending really just wasn’t that big of a deal for me as far as getting angry or upset. It made me sad. I teared up, but I found the ending to be solid and acceptable.<br /><br />Four and Tris start off Allegiant in a rocky kind of place. She lied to him about several things in Insurgent, and so he’s got some trust issues based off that. But they have a talk about how they both need to do a better job being honest with each other, and so things get better. They find themselves on more stable ground.<br /><br />My favorite relationship oriented quotes:<br /><br />“We’re not people who touch each other carelessly; every point of contact between us feels important, a rush of energy and relief.” - Four<br />“I Feel the urge, familiar now, to wrench myself from my body and speak directly into her mind. It is the same urge, I realize, that makes me want to kiss her every time I see her, because even a sliver of distance between us is infuriating.” - Four<br /><br />I was as I mentioned above extremely frustrated with Four at one point. He made a decision that was contradictory to a conversation that he and Tris had. Then he semi-rectifies it and talks about it with her. But he doesn’t listen to her. Turns out she was right. I know that’s a sticky place to be—situated between your own judgment and the judgment of someone else that you highly respect and trust. Truthfully I felt like the Four from Allegiant, and even Insurgent really, wasn’t the same person from Divergent. He felt like a completely different person. His mannerism. His speech. His attitude. His decisions. They all felt like they were coming from two different people. Maybe that was supposed to be the difference between him being Four and him being Tobias (I hate that name by the way). But I would think that Tobias would be a more complete person and Four would be just one side of himself—just the Dauntless side. But that wasn’t the case at all. Maybe the Tobias part is the part that carries the baggage from his past which weighs him down and causes him to question and doubt. Whatever the cause, and not just because of the name, but Four is a much more likable and understandable character than Tobias for me.<br /><br />One of my favorite aspects of Allegiant, and something that I don’t point out in books that I read enough, was the quotable moments that seem more like life lessons. Here are a couple of examples:<br /><br />“I need to deny them the power to control me. I need to know that I am stronger than they are.” – Four, discussing his fears.<br />“And as I stare out at the land, I think that this, if nothing else, is compelling evidence for my parents’ God, that our world is so massive that it is completely out of our control, that we cannot possibly be as large as we feel.” – Tris, which makes me think of Romans 1:20 (NKJV) – “For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse.”<br /><br />“I feel like what I have become is halfway between my mother and my father, violent and impulsive and desperately afraid. I feel like I have lost control of what I have become.” - Four<br /><br />“So how can I hold Tobias’s desperation against him, like I’m better than him, like I’ve never let my own brokenness blind me?” – Tris, forgiveness—something this world could use a little more of.<br /><br />“I used to think that when people fell in love, they just landed where they landed, and they had no choice in the matter afterward. And maybe that’s true of beginnings, but it’s not true of this, now. I fell in love with him. But I don’t just stay with him by default as if there’s no one else available to me. I stay with him because I choose to, every day that I wake up, every day that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other. I choose him over and over again, and he chooses me.” – Tris, love isn’t just about how someone makes me feel, it’s more, it’s deeper, it’s harder than just that. Yet it is utterly simply at the same time.<br /><br />Other memorable quotes:<br /><br />“I sigh. I may like to run, but I hate climbing stairs.” –Tris, a throwback to the Abnegation days of climbing to the choosing ceremony from the very beginning of Divergent.<br />“There’s no need to giggle...” – Caleb (you need the context to find this funny)<br /><br />“Be brave.” - Four<br /><br />Ultimately I think that the Divergent series reminds me a lot of The Hunger Games series not just in concept, but in how I felt about both series as a whole. I LOVED the games. And I LOVED the Dauntless initiation process. But I hated the political part of both of these series. I disliked the whole war idea and taking down the corrupt government. While I do really love the idea of how much one person can make a difference, this side of the series—the war and politics—wasn’t what I fell in love with. I wanted more initiation. I wanted more Dauntless. While I love Tris and Four, I think I would have been happier with the series if we’d followed other characters through their initiation process rather than follow Tris and Four through the rise and fall of multiple corrupt governments. Whereas with The Hunger Games series, I loved both The Hunger Games and Catching Fire because both of these had a the games in them, I didn’t really like Mockingjay as much because it focused on the politics. Unfortunately for the Divergent series, Divergent itself was the only book in the series that focused on the initiation process. And therefore, both Insurgent and Allegiant felt lacking to me. I don’t typically read reviews before I write my own, but I broke my own rule in this case and I can’t think of a better way to describe this than she did. Jen from YA Romantics said in her review of Allegiant on Goodreads that Divergent felt more Dauntless and Allegiant felt more Abnegation. That’s the perfect way of describing these two books.<br /><br />The ending of Allegiant was very Abnegation—true Abnegation. I strongly wish I could discuss this is greater detail with you guys, but I can’t spoil it for anyone who hasn’t read it. I’m surprised I haven’t spoiled anything in this review as it is.<br /><br />Anyway, I think Allegiant gets 4 Stars. It’s still a well written book. It still sparked emotion within me—even if mostly anxiety. Have you read Allegiant? If so, what did you think? (Please keep comments spoiler free!)<br /><br />**I refuse to call him &#34;Tobias&#34; except when referring to the differences in his personality.seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse.”<br /><br />“I feel like what I have become is halfway between my mother and my father, violent and impulsive and desperately afraid.

B00F3W9NQ2|3.0|I'm just over Vampire Diaries.  I really enjoyed all the previous seasons but this season just drags on.  I guess there's only so many interesting options for vampires and this series has presented them all as far as I'm concerned.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Very addicting game. Takes away most of my time but its easy leveling up and the adventure never ends. The online is very challenging and cool to play with other players just using your kindle.
1476729085|4.0|An off beat, funny love story. I read the one star reviews and have to say I cannot understand people who didn't see the humor. To me it was clever and endearing and totally enjoyable.  It's not deep, nor realistic, but it's not that kind of book.  If you only read heavy, &#34;meaningful&#34; tombs, this book is not for you. It's light and humorous but not slap stick silly stuff which I don't find entertaining usually (or I grow tired of quickly).
B00632HWOG|1.0|It won't open feels like the roll out of Obama Care. I have tried several times. Very aggregating and irritating.<br />Hope they fix it soon.

B003NFM3JK|4.0|This is a very good adaptation of A Christmas Carol.  If you liked the Polar Express and Christmas movies in general, you'll love this one too!
B004J4WKUQ|2.0|Cline obviously shares the passion of every geek and nerd of the past decade, and it shows through his extensive references to both the 80s culture of his youth and nerd culture in general. I for one greatly enjoyed the numerous homages. Unfortunately, that's all I really liked about it. The writing was mediocre, the story is fairly predictable, and the characters are trite.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is great. Not too easy, but not so hard as to keep me from wanting to play. Lots of fun and rather addictive. I highly recommend it.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I like the camera HD it is cool. Would recommend this to anyone. You can do a whole lot of stuff on this, Like video, camera. If you want to do action camera which that means you can move fast and still get a good picture.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Recall fun game that can help you pass time or challenge you to think. If you like puzzle games, it's for you.
B0084TWN9K|3.0|I am part of a book club and our teacher gives the feedback after we´ve read the chosen book. Usually when I don´t like what I´m reading our Literature teacher explains or unveils details of the author´s style that makes it much more interesting. I guess that as Ms. Munro is a Nobel Prize winner there is a reason for it and I am not to the level of those wise judges who gave her the prize. Up to now I´ve read the first two stories and I found them inconclusive and they didn´t move me at all. Let´s wait until I hear and discover what my book club friends and teacher have to say. Probably I &#34; didn´t get it&#34; and so I was bored.
B00684J49U|5.0|Great item , if you love grays anatomy this is a season to add to your collection ,I recommend this item.thank you

B000I9VZJ8|1.0|I like this movie, but when I tried to rent it so that I could watch it again, I had to spend $6.00 and nothing happened! all it says was, &#34;please wait a few minutes&#34; I had to buy this movie for $10.00, and it said the same thing, and I waited more than &#34;a few minutes&#34;!! my warning to everyone: BUY THIS ON DVD INSTEAD OF RENTING IT ON AMAZON INSTANT VIDEO!!! I've waited more that 20 minutes and nothing happened!! HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!

B0037KMHRY|5.0|Electronic score. The first I've listened to. Amazing.<br /><br />I think Daft Punk did something special here.<br /><br />Epic soundtrack and movie.<br /><br />The tracks aren't long, but they never get old.
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|Excellent movie, it's funny, very entertaining, and you can't go wrong with Pixar. The grand kids love it, and so do the adults.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I am a Star Trek fan from the original TV series to the movies to all the spin-offs.  This was offered at a great price on cyber Monday sale week, so I had to have it to add to the first Star Trek reboot.  If you are a fan, you have to own what was seen on the big screen.
0307887448|5.0|Easily one of my three favorite books.  Excellent written, engaging characters, and a wonderful plot steeped in popular culture.  If you are a fan of virtual reality or the 80s, or even good science fiction in general, I cannot recommend this novel highly enough.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|If your looking for a never ending game this is it board filled with levels<br />Get it now don't wait.<br /> .
B00F30S0Y0|4.0|Rating Reflektor is difficult.  It does not come close to achieving the spectacular heights of Funeral and The Suburbs, but it maintains the typically strong quality expected of one of today's best active bands.  Afterlife is a particular highlight of the album; it is a song deserving of being paired with some of Arcade Fire's other best efforts, such as Wake Up or Ready to Start (certainly top ten, possibly top five).  The Orpheus and Eurydice songs are quite intelligent, and most of the other songs sufficiently impress.  However, parts of the album, most notably the &#34;hidden track&#34; contained in Supersymmetry, can instill a sense of bloat, begging the question whether this deserved to be a double album.  The answer is emphatically no (at 85 minutes, simply cutting out the hidden track would have made this a wonderfully loaded single album), but that does not detract much from the album itself.  I would recommend it; I mean, if you have the choice between this and the other two aforementioned albums for a roughly equivalent price, definitely go for them (I consider this roughly equal to Neon Bible; both have different merits depending on the individual).  However, if this is on sale, or if you already own the other albums, it is certainly worth purchasing.
B003VANOFY|4.0|great sound and good range of wireless<br />only one drawback, the driver still not working on windows 8.1, when i try to install it, my pc hang.
B004SBQGHS|2.0|Don't see why there is so much hype around this game. Found it really boring, ended up deleting it soon after.
B00GINENG0|5.0|I LOVE IT IT IS SO CUTE YOU GET TO WATCH HIM GROW. SO ALL YOU HATERS YOU STINK CAUSE THIS IS A REALLY GOOD GAME
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Loved it; great book about the family as a whole; made me go and my little ones a bonus nighty kiss tonight
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it!! It is like temple run...BUT MORE FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOL I have soooo much FUN!!!! It's a little addicting though....
B00FXMGI0G|1.0|This is one of the worse movies I have seen in recent memory.  I am so disappointed because I really liked the first Red movie.  It was clever, funny, etc.  But this one is so full of gratuitous violence, torture, etc. that it is not funny.  There is nothing funny about brutality and killing for sport.  I toughed it out through this movie for about an hour, then turned it off.  I doubt I will finish it.
B00FVVR2ZO|4.0|I enjoy the beautiful graphics and music.  The story line is interesting. I like the concept of a search for Alice. Faster energy restoration, please.
B00FGEAGRM|5.0|I am SO glad I got this CD, and had it shipped to my house the first day it came out. I am a HUGE Little Monster, and GaGa's latest does not disappoint. This album is comprised of several dance/trance/pop anthems, some reminiscent of the sound heard on her Born This Way album. This is a great CD to play in the car, although it makes me want to dance while I'm driving. Love, love, LOVE the CD and GaGa.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|I love my Battleship DVD.  It is a great companion (as is Jurassic Park) for me to watch while I am weightlifting in my basement.  There is nothing like challenging an alien to motivate you get &#34;one more rep&#34;.
1250012570|3.0|I really don't know who I should blame for it so I prefered not rating the purchasing. The copy of the book it's fine and it arrived in time, but when I reached it there was a part of the envelope (that was purely cardboard) completely wet, and so as well was that part of the book and its pages. It seems that it had been wet for a while because now it was more dry but the pages can be broken easily. I'm very disgusted because it was the first time I bought by Amazon and my expectations got a little ruined, i'm kind of dissapointed that I don't know what to do or can't do anything.
B005LAIGSM|4.0|\\"The Vow\\" was inspired by true events. Wow! What a terrible thing to happen. To be madly in love with your spouse, have a terrible car accident, and then have your spouse lose all memory of you in their prior life - sad and scary.<br /><br />Channing Tatum does a great job as Leo, the husband who is being left behind, and Rachel McAdams is gorgeous, as always, and is the wife Paige who loses her memory. Jessica Lange has a great part as Paige's mother. And of course Tatum isn't hard on the eyes.<br /><br />This movie hit just the right notes. It could have been overly dramatic or romantic but it was just right.
B002FQOI0A|4.0|I loved how the author wove time travel, references to A Wrinkle in Time (one of my favorite books), and realistic adolescent characters (each has very believable flaws) into this story. I immediately recommended it to my 12 year old granddaughter
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I love it and I just cant stop playing! I reccomend it to basically anyone, it starts getting really difficult at about night 11
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Couldn't have done a better job. I was so excited too have gotten this app, just sad that I dint get the cards I wanted from the start. Next game, make a mechanism that allows players to choose their starting lineup.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's hard to stop playing once you start. The only problems I've noticed is that on the kindle version you can't get the bonus wheel feature.  This might be an update problem.
B00CM7FLZ8|5.0|So much fun! I enjoy the challenge of each level, and the availability of different weapons. Often the solution brings a chuckle!
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I love the neon colors!  I have this and other versions, all of which I like. Great series of games.
B004EPYZPI|5.0|Love the dram a and intrigue, plot keeps you interested throughout. Acting is above average  and then there's Matthew McConaughey!
0061537969|5.0|Not my usual read.  I couldn't quite fathom the idea of reading a book about a race driver.  But I am a real dog lover and was captivated by the story coming through in the voice of the dog.  Such a touching story.  Get the kleenex out! Another one of my favorite stories!
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|Awful.  Not much more to say.  It should be a kids movie, but it's violent with scary aliens, so I'm not sure who it's made for other than as a vehicle for Will Smith to try to launch a career for his son. The acting from both Smith and his son is atrocious and the plot makes little sense.  There are a lot of better sci-fi movies out there and a lot of better Will Smith movies too. Save your money and more importantly your time and opt for something else
1465408681|5.0|My son has recently started reading, and is a HUGE Star Wars fan, so I picked this book up on a Lightning Deal to give him as a birthday gift.  He loves it!  The action figure is cute, and he uses it to walk around the pages of the book and act out what he reads.  I like that the book is hardbound and very nice, with colorful pictures and neat stories that keep my son reading by his own choice!  Overall, I am very pleased with this product and happy I made the purchase.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The author drags you in and you can't let go, just like the other books.  I hated for the end to come even though I knew it had to at some point.  Katniss will live on.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is a classic Christmas comedy that I watch year after year. The acting is good, and the plot is hilarious. Everyone I know that sees a house decorated with thousands of lights, calls it a &#34;Griswold house&#34;.
0385537131|5.0|After 25 years, John Grisham still has the touch.  He tells an intriguing story and is never boring.  I don't know how he does it.
B004742Y68|5.0|Looked good and still a great movie.<br /><br />I'm not much on this kind of flm but I liked the story and the effects.
B000005ITX|5.0|Great album! I highly recommend it if you like psychedelic 60's music. There are many gems which I never get tired of listening to.
B000AJIF4E|1.0|Previously, I bought a pair of Sony MDR-V6 headphones because of the reviews on sites like amazon praising the sound quality and durability. After about 9 months that pair starting giving me problems with the sound cutting out in on ear unless I bent the cable at a certain spot. I fixed that pair myself but cutting and soldering the cable together again, but I was pretty disappointing at how quickly they had problems. Thinking it was a fluke, and needing another pair of headphones for work, I ordered a pair of Sony MDR7506 headphones. They seemed to be working fine until about 8 months after I bought them when one side completely stopped producing any sound. I couldn't believe it, but I blame myself for buying another pair of Sony headphones. Very disappointed.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Sherlock Holmes is a true classic. His stories always keep you thinking and sometimes you even get ahead and are surprised by the results.
B004KNM3EY|5.0|I can't complain about anything this deluxe edition offers except maybe providing a slip cover so the spine doesn't crease so easily. Other than that minor complaint this package offers just about anything you could want. The b-sides to this album are just as amazing as the record itself and the DVD footage is worth the price just for the Neil Tennant cameo and Richard Oakes first show (though it is quite a rough watch a parts). Time to order Head Music!
B00DNB9RXO|5.0|Omg this is my new most favorite game on the kindle fire! Great graphics and awesome music. I can't find any flaws in this game. Very exciting and some levels are difficult,  but not so difficult it makes me want to delete it. I recommend you get it while it's still the free app of the day, but I would buy for 5 times the amount they're selling it for. Please get!!!!!!!! I recommend.
B0087EACJK|2.0|Got this for free on a day it was featured. Played for a couple of days, but didn't keep my interest.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|very well written, keeping my attention.  erotic without being &#34;dirty&#34; .  Heterosexual in nature yet very stimulating to a non heterosexist.

B00FR0GT9Y|3.0|It's an okay album.  I was really looking forward to this album and &#34;wanting&#34; to hear the classic innovation that Tom Scholz gave to Boston.  However, this album does not convey that.  The first track does have it's moments in the chorus, but the chord progression and melody in general are not awe-inspiring.  I would say it's the best track on the album though.<br /><br />One of the surprising tracks is Sail Away with Brad Delp.  I don't know when it was recorded, but I was thrilled to hear Brad Delp sing again.  Perhaps it was a leftover from Corporate America?  The song itself could have been arranged better and I think it should have just started on the piano part and skip the intro.  I also don't care for the &#34;vocal&#34; talking during the song.  It should just be plain singing.<br /><br />I don't think the 2.0 version songs really make an impact except for &#34;You Gave Up On Love&#34;.  The acapella intro sounds fantastic.  I just wish Brad sang that one in 2002.<br /><br />All in all, it's an okay album.  What it suffers most from is editing.  Most of the songs I think could be &#34;remixed&#34; and arranged differently and I think some of the songs would song totally different.  Another issue is the singers.  Having three different vocalists is confusing.  Boston is not the Eagles.  Tommy DeCarlo should probably have sung all of these songs.  If they did need to have another vocalist, I think Fran Cosmo would have been ideal and would have provided some continuity.<br /><br />In the end, this is Tom's vision for the album.  He's earned the right to record what he wants and how he wants to record it.  Being an owner of some Rockman gear, I have the highest respect for him and for what he's done for rock music.  We all have high expectations when it comes to Boston, so I'll keep listening to the album...it may grow on me still.  I will say after almost 20 years, the &#34;Walk On&#34; album has grown on me and I think it's a fantastic album.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Well worth the day it is going to take you to read, you will not be able to put it down. Remember to tell your friends about it because you're going to want to sit around over coffee and chat about it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|The graphics are lovely and the games are fun. I like other slots but don't like the non gift able items.<br />Fun to play
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love to play candy crush I keep playing  until I run out of lives it is a lot of fun
B003YJEXL6|3.0|A great text for beginners in gender, sexuality, or women's studies, but not very relevant to those who are advanced in the subject.  However, Fine gives good insight into the neurobiological aspects of gender and the arguments made therein, as well as gender-neutral parenting and why it's so difficult.  I read this book in my Feminist, Gender and Queer Theory class, and it was a good resource on the subject but a little boring and repetitive for me.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|To many advertisements! But other than that it is a pretty good game. 3 stars because of all the advertisements
B000059TEP|5.0|This is one of my old time favorite movies of all time. I can watch it over and over again and love it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Science fiction at its best. It's hard to believe that this book is almost thirty years old. It rings true today just as it did then.
B00GX598FO|4.0|Liked it...but I think the movie makers were reaching just a bit trying to capitalize on the 1st movie...good fiction though
B009CPJHY4|3.0|Fun to see India and the acting was good --- but I was not really wowed as much as the critics.
B00FY0ZC54|3.0|It attracted my attention only after a couple of pages. But after finishing it, I found that the plot is not all that well drafted. It is a little bit hard for me to connect to the characters. However, since I was reading the graphic novel version, the review might be a bit bias. I probably will give the actual book a go to see how it differs from its graphic novel version.
B00DGGIXS6|3.0|I love Cher and Woman's World is a terrific song --- but I thought most of the other songs were kind of blah.
B009F7OUQE|5.0|My daughter has loved playing with these princesses.  Six months of daily play and they show little wear and tear. Highly recommend and love that they are not a choking hazard to her little brother who is six months old.
B007N85POS|5.0|Love it and so does my great grandson.  There are so many options and levels to keep you interested in the game.
0316069515|5.0|This is a great book. THE GODS OF GUILT is a reference to the jurors who decide the fate of the accused, but Connelly does a magnificent job of making it a theme throughout the book with his protagonist Mickey Haller - it's his conscience weighing heavy on the damage done to his family relationships by his work, it's the harm done to innocent victims by Haller's past clients, and it's the responsibility he feels when his friends and colleagues fall victim to violence. All of it leaves Haller to ruminate that \\"everybody has a jury, the voices they carry inside.\\"<br /><br />To purge his own \\"gods of guilt\\" Haller will stop at nothing to prove the innocence of Andre La Cosse, who is accused of killing Haller's previous client Gloria Dayton - and what follows is a fast-paced, intriguing read that builds and builds until reaching what I found to be a terrific ending.<br /><br />Every aspect of this book is exceptional - the story arc and pacing, the investigative phase and courtroom drama, the relationships between lawyers and clients, and the tension and drama between the prosecutors and the defense attorneys, Connelly absolutely knocked all of it out of the park.<br /><br />To cite something specific (without including any spoilers) that makes me give this book such high praise - contrast THE GODS OF GUILT with a book I read earlier this year: John Lescroart's THE OPHELIA CUT. Lescroart is a good author but The Ophelia Cut's product description billed Dismas Hardy as resorting to an act of \\"legal genius\\" to save the day for his client and his law partners ... unfortunately what actually happened in that story was in reality just dumb and not even close to being genius. Worse, it wasn't even Hardy who thought of it. It was really disappointing. However ... in THE GODS OF GUILT it is definitively Mickey Haller's thoughts, planning and actions that propel the story and cast of characters - for better or worse - toward a resolution.<br /><br />I read so many books where the author uses luck or for lack of a better word \\"magic\\" to save their protagonists - as was done in THE OPHELIA CUT - but Connelly doesn't do that. This is one of the best writer's in the business at the top of his game and I highly recommend THE GODS OF GUILT.e author uses luck or for lack of a better word \\"magic\\" to save their protagonists - as was done in THE OPHELIA CUT - but Connelly doesn't do that.

B00280LYIC|5.0|Loved it. It was really interesting and definitely kept my attention more than HP would.<br /><br />As someone who watched the movie first I have got to say that the movie does this book no justice. They should have tried to make the movie a lot more similar to the book.<br /><br />Finished this and immediately bought the rest of the series. That's how good it was. :)
B00GIXWXEO|5.0|Great movie to watch with the kids.  Some good laugh at loud moments.  It's nice to be able to watch a movie and not have to worry about inappropriate content with my kids.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|This was my first John Green read after hearing about all the hype. He does not disappoint. I loved how real the characters and the feel of the story were. I'm a bit of a YA junkie and I have to say that John Green's books are in a whole class of their own. He is a great talent and anyone at any age would love his writing. The end of this book was bittersweet, but in that way that only real life can actually be which made the ending all that more satisfying. I can't wait to read more of his work.
1595827684|5.0|A must for any fan of MASS EFFECT, Sci Fi, and Art!<br />Great detail of all 3 games of characters!

B008NEMPTO|4.0|Fun movie with good 3d effects.  The plot was much better than expected.  It follows young Abraham Lincoln and is a tale about vengeance.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|WOW!!! So happy I got this and been telling everyone to buy one ever since! So easy to setup and such a great price! Even with my slow internet I still get a clear picture and minimum buffering.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I've been a fan of James's since his blog launched in 2010. I don't remember how I found it then, but I'm glad I did; it pushed me and challenged me, and I owe a lot of my success since then to it, and to James as well.<br /><br />Despite being such a fan, I dragged my feet on reading this book. I assumed (incorrectly) that it'd just be the blog redux; I've got the basics of James's positions down pat, and figured this would just be more of the same.<br /><br />I was wrong. The book hit me in lots of really important ways, and it's one of the best books I've read this year. I'm grateful to James for his work and for his honesty, and I don't know what more I can say than that. Truly grateful to have him as a contributor and as a 'mentor.' Thanks, James.
1451666179|5.0|I am so glad to have added this to my collection. This is a great compilation of Allie's best writing - old and new!
034544678X|5.0|This is the best book you will ever read on dog behavior. I've been training dogs for 30 yrs and I learned a lot from this author. It's easy to read for the novice or anyone thinking about getting their first dog.<br />Fast shipping as well.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Love Pendergast. He is one of the most enjoyable characters ever. You know what he will do but you don't know how.<br />Preston and Child totally live up to their reputation with this book.<br />Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it is very fun. it is really easy to play with and if you like building up towns and framing games you will love this game. If you like gameloft games you will like this game. if you like farming games try farm story :^)  !!!!
B002G1YPH0|3.0|Looks like a nice cooler, but it turns out that I really don't need it.  So far I really don't see a reason to overclock my i7 processor, as it's already doing everything faster than I ever thought it would and it's staying cool with just the stock fan/sink.  I really don't see why anyone would need this monster hanging off your CPU.  I'm thinking this is one of those things that are used &#34;because you can&#34; and not because it's really needed.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I love Kate Morton. I read all her books and I loved them all (although my favorite is still The Forgotten Garden). This is no exception. Very entertaining. There are twists that you don't see coming as always. Very well developed characters. Can't wait for her next one!
B004J4WNL2|4.0|I enjoyed reading about all the good there is to being an introvert.  Author supplies lots of examples and references.
B00BATG18K|4.0|I waited for a long time for a book from Amy Tan and was a bit disappointed as it is not as good as her other ones. It is entertaining and kept me interested. It is just not what I was expecting. I would give it really three and a half stars, but I added the other half just because she is Amy Tan.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm glad to have bought the Omnibus Edition because I was hooked from the very beginning... I enjoyed Hugh Howey's story so much that I'm continuing on with the 'Shift' prequels.

B00D6B4PUG|2.0|As far as I can tell, this app does NOT sync existing Google Calendars on other devices with my new Kindle Fire HDX.  Since I will continue to carry my IPhone with my Google Calendar with me, it's not the end of the world, but the silliness of the app competition just turns the public against these monsters, regardless whose &#34;Fault&#34; it is.  Just smacks of  Big Business nastiness with the buying public the victim.  While I won't be returning my Kindle, this whole app thing will give me pause if I'm considering upgrading any future Kindles.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I had spent to much money over a period of time just to lose all my progress. I had light and dark dragons and many others. Every time there is an update they screw some people while others have no problems. Every game like this has done it. Just look at all the reviews and you will see what I am talking about. If it wasn't for these problems I would give this game a better rating. I removed the game and downloaded it again and got all my progress back. I change my rating and am happy to say it all worked out.this is a fun game.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|Riveting book had to keep reading it.  This is a great series, a must read to science fiction enthusiasts,will continue to enjoy reading her continued exploits.
B00APACSJG|5.0|Since the beginning of Reading the character of Miles Vorkosigan I have loved it. This is swash buckling adventurous science fiction at it finest. A character driven story that doesn't delve into techno bable for the sake of it, but leads you to fall in love with complex characters.<br /><br />For many years there was a lull in the series. I hope Ms Bujold continues to write this series for as long as she is able too.<br /><br />Cryoburn was a very enjoyable read.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|What can I say, this is a fun movie.  I would recommend it for families and folks of all ages.
B002BU0DPE|3.0|I bought this headset about 2 years ago and they worked great for my shooter games on the ps3. It was a great headset. I liked how you could turn down the chat volume and turn up the game volume so that you don't hear the screaming voices of 10-year-olds, and that it had a wire so I never had to worry about batteries or charging it I did my research before I bought this product and the plastic swiveling piece that connects the ear cup to the frame kept failing on people. I had always figured it was just because when they finished their game they threw the headset to the floor, so I bought it. Eventually, after many, many hours of use, and I was always careful not to throw it on the floor, that same plastic piece broke on my headset, but the wire was still connected so that ear still worked. I put duct tape on it to hold it back in place, but it no longer swiveled and it was uncomfortable to wear. Now, after playing for about another month, that ear no longer works, and it is uncomfortable to wear. I only get sound out of one ear now. My warranty is probably gone if I even had one. Turtle beach- I don't know if you guys fixed  this problem yet, but this headset would be great if it had a tougher swivel piece and wire. I would recommend this to anyone - just be careful not to drop it or step on it. I would buy another one if those problems are fixed and if amazon wants to be really nice to me they would send me another one for no charge.

B00GIXWHZ4|1.0|Awful, sound stunk making it nearly impossible to hear speech.  Story line made no sense.  Big waste of time, avoid.
B002MFX0RQ|4.0|&#34;Harvey&#34; is a wonderful classic movie that we've seen a number of times. It's whimsical and fun to watch! Great for Jimmy Stewart fans.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Hilarious.  Already own it, but at 1.96 on a lightening deal I could not pass up ordering a copy for my nephew.  He loves this movie too.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I like it a lot, good game to play while traveling or waiting in a doctors office. Its very easy.
B009WUBERW|4.0|Very funny movie with all the references to other action movies the actors have done. I liked Chuck Norris role.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|Well I love this  Lisa hair salon game but it's way to much money to unlock. If you want to unlock everything it's 9.99 that's a lot of money..so please lower the prices
B003QP4BJM|2.0|This book presents a very simple set of arguments –<br />1. The success of the human kind is a result of free exchange of products and ideas.<br />2. The story of the human race is a story of constant progress and while pessimism always prevailed, pessimists were always wrong.<br />3. The same logic will drive the human race to its bright future, as long as the bad guys - governments, intelligentsia, religion institutes and the like will not get in the way (and even if they will - they will only slow down the road to success).<br />  The main problems of the book are (1) the method used by Ridley to support his arguments is endless repetition, which makes some of the chapters of the book really boring. (2) The way historical facts are used to support the arguments is sometimes on the verge of bizarre. Japan's modernization in the 19th century is presented as a small merchants / no government development (while in reality it is hard to think about an initiative more directed by government), same goes for China, the Asian Tigers etc. Governments parts in creating a non-violent environment is ignored, and it is always - governments bad, merchants good, and (3) The fact that human kind progress is all but linear, and can be interrupted sometimes for generations and sometimes for nations (that are exterminated) is ignored altogether. Unfortunately in many cases in the past the pessimists were right, but Ridley simply ignores it.<br />  I did give the book two stars and not one, mainly due to chapter 9, which is amusing and well written. Although I didn't agree with all of it I found it to be good reading.<br />  In summary - I'm sure that better arguments can be provided to support Ridley's case, but what Ridley gives us is a Ted Talk spread over 483 pages. He should have done better.
B008YW5RH2|4.0|YOu think this won't be addictive but it can be and if you use your finger you will soon have a very dirty screen so learn the game with a stylus.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|An excellent book for anyone who wants a deeper scholarly understanding of the gospels and Jesus within a historical context.
B00AEBEQW8|5.0|Just great! The author is a friend of my daughter, so it is especially sweet. Every kids who has this book loves it
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I'm almost afraid to praise the author. It seems that when I enjoy an author so much....they leave us (Flynn,Clancy)<br />John Grisham is fantastic. I'm proud to be a fan.<br /><br />Bsinovcic@aol.aom
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Has an easy info availability and pop up options! Easy to use! Helpful and a great tool for getting quick accurate news on the weather!
B00G3HSF7O|1.0|Was really disappointed in the story.  It was shot well, but I can't get over the plot.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br />This movie would have us believe that the rich are jerks because they can be and that they would withhold life saving treatments from the host of humanity just because they can.  It also tries to show that the host of humanity is completely helpless and can't rise above their supposed situation to better themselves.  Unfortunately, we purchased this movie and I can honestly say that I will never willingly waste my time with this movie again
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I just started this game, but it's very easy to use. The graphics are good. And there's this one little touch I like. The fact that when you zoom in, the scope moves around. Just like it does in real life. I love that. Good game.
0307743721|2.0|Munro is a very good writer weaving mental pictures of what life was like in western Canada, but there is not much 'dear' about the stories.  Most are disturbing and sad commentaries.

B00C061I3K|5.0|From the first moment Daft Punk's melodies, instruments, and crisp sound take you on a ride. It can be explained as nothing less than a musical delicacy and journey that should be listened to from becoming to end.<br /><br />With it's mixture of electronic sounds, jazz, and disco influences this album is definitely a must buy. Daft Punk does not disappoint.
0440245915|5.0|The beginning was the 6-7 hardest pages that I've ever had to read in my life.  After that, a page turner. I wish I could stay awake longer so I can read more! I want to get to the end but I don't want it to end.  That's why, up next, is Sycamore Row - I'm hoping it has the same flair. You can't go too wrong with any of Grisham's novels.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This app was very interesting l liked it allot I would recommend this to anyone who likes race stunt games.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game. It can get addictive.  There is not problem loading with this game. It starts easy and then it gets harder as the game continues. I like to play it when I'm bored.
B008K7RGA2|5.0|Gheorghiu is the best Tosca I've seen, and Terfel leaves no doubt that Scarpia is evil, manipulative, and has absolutely no redeeming traits.  I like Alagna better than Kaufmann as Caravadossi, but Kaufmann's voice is superb; he just seemed a bit wooden.  Overall, it was a marvelous performance.  [I've seen it twice at the movie theater; that's why I wanted to own it.]
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very easy to use. Now I can watch nbc shows that I missed when they lost.their contract.with dish. I had tried plexus, YouTube and lots of other ways to watch the shows.on my smart tv.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Thank You Dr. Davis!!  My wife introduced me to your book 2 months ago.  I have struggled with weight my entire life and am dealing with CAD for 7 years now.  I made one fundamental change after reading the book--I lost the wheat---and guess what--I LOST the weight.  20 lbs to date and I do not feel deprived.  I no longer miss the bread and I have pasta very rarely as a treat.  I feel great and I have noticed the aches and pains of aging are gone.  Coincidence?  I don't think so.  I have gotten no less than 6 family and friends on it and they are ALL LOSING WEIGHT.  Nothing fancy--just lose the wheat.  I have continued the same caloric intake on all my other foods.  Losing the wheat seems to be more than caloric reduction, it impacts your entire metabolism.  I figure my body will find its level based on my caloric input and output and that's where I will level off.  I have never been happier about my weight!<br />Thank you!
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Very hard to put down. Makes one think about all the technology we all rely on every day and how it can potentially be turned against us. Great read!
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|Ann Patchett said this about WAACBO: &#34;All I want to reveal to you about this book is that it's a knockout and you should buy it and read it. The people I sell it to come back raving. When they say they want another book like it I tell them the truth: There is nothing else like it.&#34;<br /><br />She was right. There is nothing else like it. Intelligent, witty, surprising at every turn, this book is one you'll want to recommend to all of your friends.
B00GX59QO2|2.0|This was not nearly as fun as the first movie. This just seemed rushed and kind of forced. The only time it was really funny was the bit at the end of the movie. I would say avoid at all costs really and go watch the first RED.
B008HK3XKO|1.0|Didn't fit my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;. Too big. Real waste of time. If there are multiple 7&#34; Kindle HDs then that needs to be made crystal clear. if not then this product is just bad.
B006GKHE6G|5.0|This is a first-rate game with beautiful life-like graphics and fluid movements. You race and can do tricks when in the air. The Controls are responsive enough -- if I mess up it's because of my ineptness, not the game's. I can't really say I &#34;love&#34; this game -- racing is not my favorite type of game - but I am still rating it 5 stars because it's worth it.<br /><br />One thing - I am signed on as &#34;Hidden&#34; and I cannot find a way of changing my name. I don't want to sign on to Facebook or Twitter. Is there a way of changing one's name?
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it was good I liked it I want to play more it was hard and challenging but fun blather blah
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Simply put; this is a beautiful book. Beautiful writing. Beautiful images and characters that will touch your soul.  BRAVO MR. ZUSAK!
044024613X|3.0|Was not my personal taste many in book club liked it. The anticipation of a sad ending was probably why i did not care for it.
B0050CJNJ2|4.0|I liked it very much and listen too it often but it was just not as good as some of my other seasonal music.
B00G6YH6G0|5.0|I'm a 75 year old woman and other than being very  impressed with the literary skills of<br />author E. Catton, I continually wondered all through the reading,  How could a 28 year old<br />write words so beautifully and how could she know so much at such a young age?.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's fun!  It gives me a chance to clear my brain after focusing intently on something for awhile.  However, it can be addictive!!!
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|I expected it to be fresh and exciting  and was considerably let down.  James Franco is seriously over rated. The storyline was weak and unimaginative.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game but some levels very hard and u stuck for weeks. Need a way to get boosters earned faster without having to pay for them
B00BAXFECK|3.0|I loved the first two thirds of this book. Unfortunately, it got weird as it went along. I forced myself to finish it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I bought this book because I liked the title and the cover. After finishing it, I believe it is one of the best books I have read.
B00FCAJZTK|3.0|Yes, it's rough, and the tape hiss is annoying at times, but I'm glad we have it. Part XII is quite beautiful and is my favorite. Some of it is ponderous and repetitive; some would say boring. It's very much worth hearing, though, if not very jazzy.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Like the big numbers display. Easy on the eyes as well as easy to navigate. Perfect for small children and older adults.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun and addictive! Really easy to get into and enjoy. Great addition to the running games that are out, and its the minions!
B00BAXFACO|3.0|Had I been the editor, I'd have sent Connelly back to the drawing board on this one.  Unless you are a lawyer, or a student of law, you may be bored by the endless passages on lawyering strategies, which in my view greatly reduce the appeal of the novel.  Of course, this is a sequel to The Lincoln Lawyer, which was enjoyable both as the book and in the film.  So the risk for the author was that it would be too much like the original work.  That's the case, in my opinion.  The characters got pretty stale here and with one or two exceptions haven't grown much.  The title is troublesome, and it appears over and over throughout the novel.  Equating gods with guilt?  I'm uncomfortable with that.  In short, in many of his lawyer novels Grisham has outdone Connelly with more interesting scenarios and characters that truly draw us in.<br />Better luck next time.
B00AEFY66U|5.0|A classic film, it's on my list of Top 100 of all time.  It is very true to the book, and Robert Redford embodies Gatsby like no one else.  The score adds to the film, where in the new version I find the soundtrack a bit distracting.  Definitely watch this before you watch the new one with DiCaprio.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is fun and awesome how it changes stages all the the time I highly recommend this game
B00DHHWY9I|3.0|Based on my favorite book, but this movie was a little odd with the music choices and the cinematography.  The cameras shift quite a bit, and the sets are a little over-the-top, which draws quite a bit of attention from the dialogue and the story overall.  However, it was pretty true to the book, and may appeal to a more modern audience than the Robert Redford version.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham did it again I loved this book. Had to stay up to finish could not sleep with out knowing how it would end :-)
B00FR0GT9Y|1.0|I have always been a huge Boston fan.  I have really tried very hard to like this new release, but I just can't trick myself into it.  It just sounds thrown together to me.  I am happy for Mr. Scholtz in his new marriage, but at the same time if I wanted a Sheryl Crow album I'd buy one of those.  I can't fault that as the ultimate downfall of the the album however, none of the new songs have any life to them.  I guess that's why there are three songs from the last album thrown into this one.  I find Heaven on Earth to be ok, and the song Love, Life and Hope is pretty good.  Other than that it is just very forgettable.  Sail Away actually bothers me, as it is the last song probably to be heard by the late Brad Delp, and frankly it is awful.  Was it really necessary to have Mrs. Scholtz rapping an intro into the song, and having her sing hip little parts into a song that otherwise may have been a nice little farewell for Brad?  Paul McCartney once saved the Beatles legacy from John and Yoko, its to bad no one could save Boston's legacy from this.  If it's the last using the name Boston, I will be ok with that.  It seems the ride is over.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I am still in the process of reading this book.  Being naive about the law and lawyers, learning a little bit about the world of litigation is fascinating.  I am definitely hooked.  It is a fun book to read and get lost in.  Just what I was looking for.
B00FOWX6NM|5.0|Good case. Durable and slick with access to every port and the background designs are even better. Good protection overall
B00EF1PM2G|1.0|Movie is great, but releasing it in only it's &#34;R&#34; rated version is dumb.  No unrated version, No sale!!!  Oh, and I have seen both versions, and I want my extra three minutes that can be found on the unrated dvd that has been out since 2004!
B000L43AN4|5.0|An instant classic.  There are a few songs that don't do it for me, but very few.  Tom Waits is the consummate American songwriter, particularly obvious on the &#34;Bawlers&#34; disc.  &#34;Brawlers&#34; is Waits at a more rocking pace, and the &#34;Bastards&#34; disc contains some hidden gems that are not easily catagorized.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|People read fiction to be entertained and escape their reality for a while. When a book series reaches this level of popularity and readers have such affinity for the characters, the author has a certain level of obligation to those readers. This unwritten contract was broken by Ms. Roth in the final installment of the Divergent series. It feels like a betrayal and I'm unlikely to trust her with my time and emotions again.
B00EIR5XP8|5.0|I love the Victorian period and the English novels which wove tales of mystery while educating the middle class to the plight of the poor and the injustices that lead to the reforms that followed. Dickens is perhaps the writer that most readers are familiar with, if not from them having read Dickens, but seen Dickens' world through film, Broadway and great PBS presentations.<br />One problem I have always had with Dickens is that the women who populate his novels appear to be mere shells of women, a mere dressing for the plot.<br />Wilkie Collins however has peopled this mystery with a woman who shows strength of character, wit, intelligence and ability to garner respect within this novel; and how novel is that?<br />I find him much more readable than Dickens, with more suspenseful plot lines and far more believable characters.  This should have been required reading rather than some of the Dickens that was on my high school syllabus. Definitely a book you should treat your mind to as it anchors the beginings of well crafted mystery stories.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great for kids. My son and daughter love this game such. Parent, it is a kid friendly game with nothing bad. And it is great for parents, too.
0812550757|5.0|This is a spectacular novel, and I think Card's finest. The sequel to Ender's Game it is so much more than that. This is an emotional, elegant tour of human foibles and triumphs. Ender is at once terribly human and tragically transcendent. Seeing the world through the haze of pain, and finding in that pain enduring love is Speaker's strength. If you want a book that hits all the right Science Fiction notes, but also, in the best tradition of that genre, contains BIG ideas - read on.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|Like the depth of the story, though I love the older version, too.  Richard Attenborough does a wonderful job in this.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I needed something to keep me going during my withdrawal from the BBC's Sherlock. I did not expect to love Elementary. But I did. I really, really did. It grabbed me from the first episode, and while it lacked a certain British element that I, an anglophile, adore, it made Holmes so human, so sympathetic, that I couldn't help but fall for the series.
141694737X|5.0|My granddaughter is 20 months old and enjoys books, but ,most of all the ones with the flaps on them, she also enjoys animals, this seems to be the book she always brings to me when its our reading time.
B00FAXLCWW|3.0|Alright, this is going to sound totally stupid, but...  this album is too perfectly produced.  These chicks have so much soul and grit and talent and energy and OXYGEN that just gets sucked the _uck out of these great little songs by the overly-pristine production.  Such a damn shame, since, these ladies should rule the world, otherwise.  If you see them do ANYTHING live (even knocking on a car's interior and doing a little harmonizing) they are just ridiculously giddy with talent and electric joy that most people who have recording contracts are simply lacking.  So, this album should be amazing, instead, it's just amazing sounding and, somehow, amazingly boring.  Now, I'm not talking go all Albini (or, am I?) but, really, get some mics and let these sisters swing out.  Please!  They are A BAND, not a piece of software.  And I like software, but this is a unit, let it invigorate our lives with it's organic majesty.  Find a room, set up some mics, bring in some stuff and let them do what it is that they have spent their young lives honing to-- actual-- perfection-- and then, get a room with the resultant album!  I love you, Haim, please re-record.
B003G4W49C|5.0|still a fun read as an adult. we read this back in middle/high school, and grabbed it to read again before the movie came out as a refresher.<br /><br />great intro to sci fi for kids as well (we made the kids we know now read it too, and they even think it's better than the movie!)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing candy crush! So happy its on kindle finally! Its a must have app. Now make a windows phone version!
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Fun and free, two of my favorites . A lot to keep up with, but lots of help options. Thanks.  UPDATE  I now cannot access the game since updating.  Frustrating.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This is a wonderful musical.  I have seen the movie Les Miserables but I am very pleased with the movie.  Received it quickly and promptly.
B00G4NUQYM|5.0|Different than the same old, same old word games...this one makes you think as you're finding the answers...any word game that has me stumped at level two is absolutely worth it!!!
B0036RCVJM|3.0|Great story, but I felt some of the narrative went on and on and on. The fact that it is A true story and the hardship Eric survived made it well worth reading.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read it …Great book ...Read it...It's awesome...I loved it so much...Very emotional read it and you'll see it's a very good book.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Written with great style and with melancholic undertones, it's a fascinating story. However, it's amazingly entertaining. Also,  a great cultural lesson.
B00BGI086Q|5.0|Excellent series, glad I decided to give it a try.<br />one two three four five six more required words Huh
B000L3CHC0|1.0|Do not purchase this watch. You'll pay $357 for a FAKE Tissot replica. I was able to compare it side by side with an authentic Tissot at a jewelry store. To begin the weight of the bracelet is heavier and has a smooth feeling. This one is light and has rough edges not a very pleasant feeling. Another thing the yellow hand is loose. It shifts with a light hit on the side. I have to admit it. This watch has everything of an authentic Tissot. It'll be hard to spot the authenticity with the naked eye. Take my word for it. I just got this watch a couple of days ago and ready to return it.
B00GNL96H8|4.0|This film met my expectations with a balance of great fight choreography and artistry.  I am a fan of movies like Ong-bak 2, Hero, House of Flying Daggers and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  I gave The Grandmaster four stars because at times it was slow, just like Crouching Tiger.  As a student of martial arts and martial arts thinking, this movie addressed several deep human questions.  I have been waiting weeks to see this movie as I missed the few showings that were in my area when the film was released.  The movie did not disappoint.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Although the first two books were a tiny bit better, this one concludes the Grand, Heart-Touching, Emotional and Beautiful story. The war for the future is fought with grave sacrifices just like ours today. Evil comes in many forms and can be destroyed when one trusts the Heart. I want so badly to literally jump into this story and have my character help in the true Noble Quest for Freedom. I Love this whole story and although I want more, I leave the rest to my own imagination. &#34;The only thing stronger than Fear is Hope.&#34; Yes Hope, Love, Honor, Heart and Spirit. May Destiny guide us all Home.
0385486804|4.0|Really love this book because the author's ways of writing, and fascinating real story.<br />Makes me think the way of life hard
B00GIXWHZ4|4.0|I give the movie 4 stars largely because it was leaps and bounds better than Origins: Wolverine. In vast contrast to the film, Amazon Prime streaming video needs a lot of improvement. I paid for the HD movie yet it streamed in SD because of &#34;Connection issues.&#34; I find this interesting since I have never had a problem gaming online or streaming Netflix on the same Xbox 360, in the same apartment. The sound mix was poor in the stream as well. I had to have my volume at 34 to hear the dialog in most parts of the film when I usually keep it at about 15. Like I said before the movie is a lot of fun to watch, but the stream from Amazon Prime made it hard to really enjoy it.
006202406X|2.0|I found it difficult to connect to this third book. It was almost as if these characters had been &#34;played out&#34; from the previous book, but I stuck with it because...that's just what I do and because I'm a sucker for a happy ending. Needless to say, I am beyond disappointed. Unlike a movie when I commit only 2 hours of my life to engage in a story line, I spent numerous hours reading a novel series that connected me to the main characters. The last thing I want to have is a tragic ending. Life is hard enough as it is.<br />Did Suzanne Collins kill Katniss or Peta in the Hunger Games? After having this happened to me several times when reading Nicholas Sparks's books, I am determined not to waste time on his novels again. The same will now hold true for Veronica Roth novels. :  (
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Helped me out tremendously when I was ready to publish a Kindle book after a long hiatus. Great resource to have handy.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|Susan's voice is excellent, bluesey, expressive, emotional. Derek is right up there with Duane Allman on slide. Great combined.<br />Really strong band  backing too.
B003PJ6UHA|2.0|Although it is well written, I feel there is more to know about biocentrism than the authors conveyed – much more.  Perhaps, over eager editing left revealing material on the cutting room floor, maybe there is simply more information than is convenient for a short volume meant for the lay public.  Whatever the reason, I plan to read it a second time and give it another review knowing what to expect.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|Originally posted on my blog: [...]<br /><br />A lot of the time, I stay away from the sad books. It's not that I don't like them, it's just that when I read, I immerse myself in the book, place myself in the characters' shoes and as a result, sad books really destroy me. So I really don't think I would've picked this up on my own, but I read it as part of the Gayle Forman read along and I'm SO glad I did. This book was just phenomenal!<br /><br />As I just mentioned, sad books can really destroy me but this is the first book in a long while that has made me full out cry. As in, tears streaming down my face, ugly cry kind of sobbing going on. This book was heart wrenchingly beautiful.<br /><br />On one normal day, on a normal trip with her family, something happens that changes Mia's life forever and now, she has to make a choice. Should she live and stay or would it be better to just let go?<br /><br />When Mia's life changing event happens, it was so sudden and so abrupt that I literally had a moment where I went, WHAT. Not only is it sudden, but delivered in such a way that it leaves this hollow feeling in your stomach and from that moment on, I was glued to the book. Mia watches things happen to her and around her and woven between the present of her in the hospital, flashbacks of memories and events occur. I loved how the little flashbacks gradually unfurl Mia's former life as well as showing you who she was. I loved the interactions with her family -- while her parents could be quirky, they were so loving and each scene just kind of tugged on my heart a little bit more. You see what she had and also, what was ripped away from her.<br /><br />\\"I realize now that dying is easy. Living is hard.\\"<br /><br />And then there's Adam. Oh, this boy. I think Adam's love shows the kind of raw, unconditional love that everyone wishes to experience.<br /><br />\\"I can't wrap my mind around the notion of you not getting old, having kids, going to Juilliard, getting to play that cello in front of a huge audience so that they can get the chills the way I do every time I see you pick up your bow, every time I see you smile at me. If you stay, I'll do whatever you want. I'll quit the band, go with you to New York. But if you need me to go away, I'll do that too.\\"<br /><br />One of my favorite quotes ever. I love how emotional this book was and how it so beautifully showed Mia's struggle of whether or not to live. It may be painful but it was amazing. Prepare yourself though because tears WILL be shed.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun and free. not too easy not too hard. not enough levels though. hopefully more will come soon. I escaped!

B008GWP2GG|4.0|An excellent representation of the Travis Walton alien abduction story however the experience with the aliens is highly fictionalalized per Travis Walton himself.

B008JFUS8M|5.0|Followed the book perfectly, and that's the first time I could say that about a movie based on a novel! Amazing what they fit into the 2 1/2 hour time span! A must see and I'm dying to see it again!!!! Anyone who says this is boring is crazy don't listen to them!
B00FATEJYE|4.0|This game is a lot of fun. So much so I now plan on buying the console game. I wish there was a little more storyline, but I highly recommend it.
B007JCP8FE|4.0|I like it, first day I downloaded this it played all day on repeat! Thanks for another great album shinedown!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Its a very addictive game. I couldn't put it down. But for some reason it started me on level 1 when i was on level 34. But great game anyway.
0316228583|3.0|Didn't care for this book and the reason is, I like to read for entertainment as well as education.  There has to be something inspiring with the uninspiring.  Not so with this book.  There were no real likable characters.  Sad because I know JK Rowling is a wonderful writer, but when I am not looking forward to reading, I look for another book.
1577314808|5.0|This book is an amazing book. it will change your life<br />So far, I liked it.<br />it came fast. no complaint

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book hooked me the second I laid eyes on it. I think I've read it four times and it still hasn't grown old. This series is the absolute greatest you will find.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|My grandson downloaded this but I'm enjoying it too! It is worth down loading and definitely addicting. You will enjoy it too.
0062238868|5.0|Awesome book.  My husband read it and then I thought I would give it a try...I loved it too even though it is probably geared more toward the males.  What an inspiration!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun addicting game I bought it thinking this probably won't be fun but it proved me wrong great for kids and family.

B006JRY2QG|4.0|Truly enjoying this series. I was drawn to it because of the stars and their other roles. I'm looking forward to watching further into the series.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|downloaded it a couple of days ago, an i cant stop playing.  The controls are pretty easy, and makes for an enjoyable time!
B00BOL22GY|5.0|Very engaging well done on many levels i couldn't stop watching. the acting and scenery are great. hope for many seasons
B00BAXFECK|3.0|Well written book & enjoyable to read.  The teenage Theo Decker roams the streets while consumed with grief over the death of his mother who was murdered in the museum as collateral damage in a terrorist attack.  Central to the book is a yearning for family and its inherent stability, as epitomized by Theo's deceased mother.  Well worth reading.
1401322786|5.0|Really enjoyed this book by Albom. Story line was interesting, found book to hold my interest (no slow spots). Have already recommended to others, told them it's a book to put on their read list.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I love this game it works well with conslol and it is very good. I love joker and deathstroke and hope to get better skins for other characterss
0452289963|5.0|This book will change your life! It gives you a new look into what goes on between Self and ego. It inspires you to become the grey area.  Life is what it is.  It isn't black or white, it just is.
B002CSC5EC|5.0|The Blu-ray version has such a clear picture/resolution and the sound is also great, using a surround sound system. It seems to be better than I remember, when I first saw it at the cinema, all those years ago.

This is a lifesaver.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Play at least once a day. Highly addictive so only four star rating from me. Addiction is bad so I shorted it a star or else I would've gave it a five.
B00FQU8XTE|5.0|This is such awesome music.  I thank God that these musicians are sharing their wonderful gift with the world.  Hallelujah!
B00E9P959O|5.0|This album definitely sounds better with the remastering.  I liked the original cd, but did find the sound too thick.  The music was always exceptional.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|I really liked this movie, my wife wasn't as impressed.  It had action and humor and ladies in tight clothes; what's not too like!?
0316055433|4.0|This is a well-written novel which is interesting, funny and moving.  But it all seemed a bit far fetched at times.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|I like the action and adventure movies and this one delivered.  It had some humor and it looks like there is a new action hero since I saw the new guy in the Avengers.
B000068UXF|5.0|This is a phenomenal opera by Strauss.  It's a pleasure to be able to see the characters and interesting sets in this excellent performance.  In many ways, this opera reminds me of Mozart's The Magic Flute, but it's more serious and more modern.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I absolutely loved it. I literally couldn't put it down. I'm kind of glad I hadn't heard of The Hunger Games when it first came out because I don't know how I would have been able to wait for the next books to come out:)
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Find objects in timed beautiful scenes while collecting objects and fulfilling quest objectives. Well made game with energy refill and boost charms.  It is possible to play without ever spending money.
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|It's ok, that's about it.  Being made in China and not coming with batteries or mounting hardware, (mine did not come with velcro),<br />I feel it is over priced, especially if you pay any freight charges.
B00GX598FO|4.0|Good sequel. Clean story and I like how you 'used' older actors and actresses. Just enough action without getting too fake.
B006885EFE|5.0|This is by far the best portrayal I have ever seen of any World War II movie (technically it is a 10 part mini-series). So far I have only bought 2 episodes, but I have seen the whole mini-series on the History channel. My dad, two of my uncles, and my fath-in-law were in World War II. One of my uncles died on a boat from a torpedo attack. He was 19. That generation never talked about their experiences. I finally got my father to tell me some of his part when he was about 85. I called him up on Veteran's Day, saying that I wanted to thank a vet for his sacrifice. He was so touched that he started to open up about some things . He's in Heaven now, but I'm so glad that I did that. One year I did the same thing with my brother who was in Vietnam. He was very surprised and thanked me, but he really does not want to talk about it. That's okay with me. Just a chance to tell him I love him. The one thing I absolutely loved about Band of Brothers was how the actual vets talked about themselves, their fears, their love for our great country at the beginning of each episode. Dick Winters (played by Damion somebody, who is actually British, but you would never know it), was or is a great man. I'm not sure if he is still alive(the real Dick Winters). So many good actors. The language is the only thing that made me cringe. I'm sure that's how it really was. It still gets a 5 star rating from me.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Come on, who doesn't love star trek. I thought the movie was great. But JJ said this series was going to be nothing like the original series. Now it looks like everything is just a rehash of the old movies. What's next? Borg? I will continue to watch either way.

B00B0LPYXG|2.0|I chose to watch this movie because I like Denzel Washington. But the opening nude scene made us turn it off.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I knew going in a Feast for Crows would be a rough read. The choice to focus on characters by geographically location was a mistake, as George R. R. Martin has admitted. While Arya has a few chapters, Dany and Tyrion are completely absent and Jon is only in one chapter not from his POV.<br /><br />Feast for Crows does introduce the points of view of great characters such as Brienne of Tarth and Aeron Greyjoy. Sadly it also includes Areo Hotah, the worst POV in the series for being simply a pair of eyes, one-off chapters from characters who either die or didn't add much to the story, and three Greyjoys, which is too many for my taste considering how minor the house is compared to the Starks and Lannisters. A large portion of the book is from Cersei's perspective, which I have mixed feelings about. What you learn from her in Feast for Crows pays off in A Dance with Dragons, but it also meant losing the mystery of her scheming. Jamie is much of the book too, making the Lannisters together 38% of the pages. A Feast for Lannisters is more like it! Jamie's POV was more valuable to me after the events of Storm of Swords changing her purpose and attitude greatly. Cersei in contrast just becomes more paranoid and sinister.<br /><br />Despite my criticisms, I devoured the book and still enjoyed it. What I appreciated the most was the focus on the devastation of war, the aftermath as the War of the Five Kings slows down following the Red Wedding. The more religious tone of those stranded was a nice change from the first three books. That said, not much actually happens in this book. It's just a lot of movement, not much change since all the main players are absent. I wasn't left satisfied with the main story by the end, even if individual tales kept my reading.<br /><br />If you loved the first three books, read through this one and go onto A Dance for Dragons, which is more similar to the second and third book. That said, Feast for Crows has more Arya than Dance with Dragons,an automatic +1.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|A true masterpiece................Even having seen it many times before, I could not stop watching it. Also, it was an excellent transfer to HD.

B007IQX1G4|1.0|This movie is seriously depressing. Not much of a resolve in the end. If you want to waste an hour of your life and end the movie feeling depressed, by all means... watch this.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play this daily and connected to FB and I am able to play with friend.Love this game made the 3 hours i had to wait for my dr. being late GO fast. I love it \
B00005JNQS|5.0|This is one of my nieces favorite movies, she talked me into purchasing it so she could watch it at my house. I'm glad I did because she does sit and watch it all the time.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I say pick up the books and read it, Suzanne Collins has a great imagination :)<br />So just pick it up and read it it's one of a kind
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I bought this movie as a gift. The person I bought it for had never seen it, said that it was a really good movie as well.
1401938906|5.0|Whether familiar with the concept, or just searching, the exercises in this book WILL help in reaching your potential in any area of manifesting for your good and good fortune.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|A++<br />The game is a great way to get it going very fun to play I luv the game this is the best I hope it keep going
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|If you are a TF2 fan you will love this game it's awesome different than most other games. Get this game it's boss!!!!
B00FR0GT9Y|5.0|I like this CD;  I don't expect it to be the same as 1976...Tom still has some great ideas...I don't understand why you have to go to Best Buy to get the bonus track version...It is a version of the old song &#34;I had a good time&#34; from 2002...well worth a trip to best Buy, but why do I have to?
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I have tried this game oon peoples iphones, and don't.get me wrong its super fun. but on my kindle (I have the oldest one) its will be loading and it will stop on a certain number and stay like that! dissappointing because the game is really fun, I just want to be able to pplay it :(
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Looks good so I'm probably going to love this game<br />Hopefully it won't be a torturing game or<br />That would suck
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Fun and free! Who could ask for more? High gig on fire though...so be warned that it takes up space. Otherwise everything is completely perfect.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Fun game, had to have someone show me how to play it, very similar to regular solitaire, but different enough to be a game all of its own, also got the backgammon game- fun!!
B002SJKWZ4|4.0|I'm very surprised the wand works. When you first get it, it's best to practice all of the 13 gestures before you program the wand. It might be a little frustrating at first but you'll get the hang of it! QUICK TIP: Write a list of all your standard remote buttons you program into your wand as a guide when you start using it, but after a while you won't need it!<br />Overall, this wand remote is a very fun entertaining item and it's definitely worth the cost!
0596007124|4.0|Reading this book do not dismiss you of the obligation of reading GoF's one, but this book will help you fix patterns on your mind. Specially for Java programmers, since examples are all in such language. It's a helpful for those that are not conversant with Smaltalk or C++, my case. My only complaint is the fact that they don't cover deeply all patterns, talking about some of them just superficially.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|who doesn't love candy crush. great game..very hard to stop when you run out of lives. I can play it on my phone or my Kindle.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really fun to play, and it is hard to get bored while playing it. I recommend it for any age
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great movie. A lot of background information about how it all came about and how hard some of our people worked to get OBL.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|This came was o.k. Even thow it takes forever to buy stuff at the store its still fun in the game itself. And it's free!
B00BLSJI80|5.0|Demi Lovato's new self titled album &#34;DEMI&#34; is a quite extraordinary if I do say so myself. As you can see, I am a young man of 11 and I am quite a lover of music. This was actually the very first album of Demi's I actually heard.This is definitely my FAVORITE album!!! She has great positive messages in all of her songs! When ever I feel sad or upset I always put this on!!! Demi is definitely my new favorite singer and role model!!! Everyone should buy this and listen to it whenever they are sad or upset!!!
B00B7FOQCK|2.0|Sending it back.  I bought it to charge 4 ipod nanos that I use as a listening center in my classroom.  I was only able to get cords to connect to two of the ports.  Back to the drawing board.
B00GT1YES8|3.0|The information is good, but the CONSTANT talk about psychotherapy is quite wearing, as is the apparent assumption that all highly sensitive persons are damaged goods (which she claims not to believe to be inherently true, but pours out a LOT of ink on the topic). Good enough to finish, but I would find a different title to recommend to a friend.
B004UG7RQ0|4.0|Works as it should. Sound quality is decent.  Used it to connect an android phone to an ipod connection in my car.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Outstanding book!  Brought tears to my eyes!  Adam defines what a true hero is!  If you are a patriot this is a must read!
B00GX50BD2|5.0|The acting was amazing!  Ashton Kutcher WAS Steve Jobs!!  A very heart warming story...  It's amazing how one person contributed so much!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Great game that works perfectly. Thank god for this game and for them finally having it on kindle fire. Might be a little difficult when it comes to sensitivity but still an all around five star game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really good game, keeps you on your toes and uses your brain well. Can't wait for new games and floors.
B00EZ50SGW|1.0|I enjoyed the first film quite a bit, but thought this sequel was abysmal. The humor doesn't work at all in it and the scares are as generic as can be. James Wan can do better than this!
0385340990|4.0|This book holds your attention . It gives great insight yo local people helping each other during  the War. It gives food for thought
B00EKR61FM|5.0|We were waiting for a box set to come out before purchasing any of these movie.  This is the perfect way to own these movies.
B00CYFGCOW|5.0|Hi I'm Olivia and I must admit that I am nine years old and I use my dads account a lot. I don't have one yet but I've gotten my study on so here are my tips:<br /><br />1. When you put the batteries in make sure it's turned off because they hate being held upside down and if you do then they get mad at you<br /><br />2. It comes in the personality of sweet but will not stay that way.<br /><br />3. They will change gender for some reason so get used to it.<br /><br />4. It's fun but complicated so stick to the age recommendation. (6 and up.)<br /><br />5. Furnish is the language it speaks at first but then it will interact with you in English.<br /><br />6. Only the app let's you name it and hatch fumbling and get the golden egg.<br /><br />And like I said it starts out sweet but changes personalities and here's how:<br /><br />For jolly feed it constantly and don't turn it upside down<br /><br />For feisty turn upside down and don't tickle it<br /><br />For hyper speak in furbish and English<br /><br />For rocking play music constantly and don't pet it<br /><br />And to take it back to sweet pet and pat and don't pull its tail.<br /><br />Hope this helped,<br /><br />From,<br />Olivia🌌
B00AIBZLVY|5.0|A big fan of horror movies, this did not disappoint.  The way the children run is a cross between spider and a coyote - goose bump instilling!  Also, doesn't have a trite ending.  I highly recommend.
B009WUBERW|4.0|Shock as to how old some of the actors look !  Time to let them take over at CIA<br />or whatever!
B00CBFPO12|5.0|This book is so magical so and adds the right amount of emotion.<br />The only way I could have a great time.<br /><br />I've this book.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is a great free game! Its your typical running (flying!) game, without all the advertising for &quot;real money&quot; upgrades.
B002ZG97LK|5.0|Love the movie I think it was almost as good as the first one.  Would say that you should have both
1250006341|5.0|An iconic British Historical story. Superbly well acted and presented. The settings in the castle are remarkably reproduuced and hence very convincing.
B00466HN6S|5.0|The kids loved watching the movie with their friends and with their parents. I would say that everyone should see this one
B00GNAO796|5.0|The thing to realize here is that people are mistaking this for a 2002 version that was made for TV. I did not see that, as I could never understand how something like Carrie could be properly represented in a made for TV movie.<br /><br />This version was recently in theaters and stared Chloë Grace Moretz as Carrie. I saw it, and felt that it holds as a very solid remake with updates really only used as needed.<br />The insanity of the mother and the hate from the other people in school are properly represented here.<br />There is more caring given from the gym teacher and much more ruthlessness from the mother. I felt that Chloë Grace Moretz showed a lot of emotion just from here eyes when needed. That's something that isn't seen much if at all anymore.<br /><br />If I could rate in half stars, I would give this 4.5 simply because of one scene where the CGI is obvious. Other then that, I really can't complain.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|children loved the movie. they shared it with the other family members. I will say if you have kids you should get it
0545615402|5.0|The Hogwarts Library (Harry Potter) by: J.K. Rowling is a great set of books. I bought them for my granddaughter and she loves them!
B00DSO9RMC|1.0|This is a sad shadow of Pratchett's previous works. The characters are the same, the imagined world is the same, but the humour, the surprise and the delight are missing.
B008XX6J4C|4.0|Purchased as a gift for someone who likes &#34;listenable&#34; classical music, crossover arrangements.  Not recommended for more critical ears, but pleasant to listen to for most people, imo.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Angry Birds and Star Wars... what's not to love!  This is a fun, addictive game that I not only have on my iPhone but my Kindle too.  I love how the games start off very easy (getting you hooked!) but then become very challenging as you progress through the different levels.  If you are very competitive and don't like to lose, you can find yourself playing this for hours!  Love the way the characters are depicted too.<br /><br />This is a great game and fun for the whole family!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Very challenging. I still haven't got the hang of steering the rocket :-) I find it a little annoying that I have to hit next twice before I can hit the replay button, otherwise it's great fun!
B00947N6D8|5.0|My kids love it.  They've watched it over and over again.  It's one of those movies, except that it's good enough I don't mind.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I didn't understand the hype prior to getting the app on kindle, but now I understand. I freely admit that I am addicted. The use of primary colours don't hurt at all. Love the game!
B00G32OER4|4.0|pretty good change of pace from today's &#34;horror&#34; movies scene. well worth the price and the time to watch it.
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|We have the Extended Versions of all of the Lord of The Rings Trilogy. So when the Extended Version of the 1st Hobbit movie became available, I had to get it. Was not disappointed. Great movie!!!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|if you're this far into the series, you already know why I rated it 5 stars. you either love it or you hate it. you never know whats gonna pop off the next episode
B00FATEJYE|1.0|I think that when I started to down load this it made me get rid of some apps so I did<br />But then I couldn't hear my kindle it's only letting me listen through head phones help<br />Please
B0013O123Q|3.0|to be honest, I only watched it for the rape scene. funny, those 2 minutes make up for an otherwise uninteresting movie.....
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was a great book, never let me go from the beginning. I did what a lot of avid readers do. I was the main character. Great job Mr. Grisham.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Robust. Stamina. Plug and play when you think nobody is watching. I have one in the living room for watching films of my grandfather.
B001992NW4|1.0|What's scary about this movie is how bad it is, it doesn't age well at all and the movie makes you laugh rather than being scared ,overall out of 10 I would give it 3/10 I wouldn't even recommend renting it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved The Shinning and danny and now get to see him years later! Definite read for any king fan! If you haven't read the Shinning, then read it first and then this one and you will like it!
B00164GDA0|5.0|One of the best coming of age movies out there and it stands the test of time highly recommend this movie to anyone who is not sure about the movie!!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This book made my flight to Germany very enjoyable.  I highly recommend this book especially if you are interested in Korean history.
B00BFBSV72|5.0|This game keeps with the 'spirit' of the Sonic character and is a lot of fun to play. If you ever played the Android game called 'Cordy' and enjoyed it-this will not disappoint you. All kids, young and old will love this game.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a great game it's a lot of fun there is a lot to do now keeping your environment good is very difficult otherwise it's a great game love it.
B00GSAC1UI|5.0|Beautiful arrangements and a nice selection.  Made a nice addition to my Christmas music collection.  They all have wonderful voices.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|My &#34;get home and relax after work game&#34;. LOVE IT!! I highly recommend it. It draws you in and has good daily bonuses.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My grandchildren introduced me to this game...if you enjoy Angry Gran Run you will also enjoy this game...would highly recommend.
B009RX85N0|5.0|LOVE this show and so happy to have it to watch whenever I want including extras! Quality is of course beautiful, if you know you want the 2nd season of Once Upon A Time, buy it!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I thought that this game was well worth buying. It is very entertaining and fun. I suggest this game to anyone that likes weapons and how they work in general.
B007FJUP2W|4.0|I got the natural colored TOMS and they are so cute! They are true to size. Extremely comfortable.<br /><br />I paid around $60; For crochet flats that is a little bit pricey considering there were similar shoes by other brands for $25. I have never owned TOMS and thought these would be perfect for my destination wedding which is why I went ahead and paid the $60.<br /><br />All in all, good material, great cause, and great shoes. Highly recommend.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|awesome to play in free time when your bored and then unlock everything in that game is addicting lol :p
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is one of Mr. King's best books. I re-read the Shining and this story of Danny Torrance many years later is much better and I'm not dissing the Shining.<br />Read it and enjoy
B00CN3R2DK|5.0|Beautiful packaging, early delivery, high quality product. Perfect for a collection or gift, I'm gifting mine for Christmas to someone who wants a doll. NOT for playing, but for display.
1620402777|5.0|This is so appealing. I love to see &#34;Easter Eggs&#34; and other things hidden in plain sight. Steganography is a hobby of mine, so seeing all the Simpson's brilliance described by the very talented Simon Singh has filled me with pleasure.<br />His genius is in taking quite complicated ideas and making them accessible to untrained people.<br />I have used video clips of his, read all of his books and have been generally enthralled by what he has to offer. Thank you and please keep up the great work
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I get my &quot;candy fix&quot; with this game.  Believe it or not I reach for my kindle to play instead of reaching for the candy bowl.  Having so much fun and even lost a couple of pounds.  Pretty sweet deal!!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|A cheap, easy read.  The continuing story of Danny (20+ years ahead) and the ghosts that continue to &#34;shine&#34; in his life revealed and resolved.
B002MFULQO|5.0|A star studded cast and riveting story. Took me back 50 years in history and held my interest for 3 hours.
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|Very disappointing! The last 30 minutes I just fast-forwarded because it just kept repeating with Superman and Zod beating on each other. There were many other issues with the movie that would take me too long to type. Don't waste your money.
0062014102|5.0|This is a must-read for everyone with questions about who they are, what is their purpose, how do they fit into the larger picture, or unresolved issues of religion and spirituality. It provides meaning and provokes many questions. It left me feeling both very powerful and also very small. I felt like I had a lot of learning and work to do to make use of this gift of life. For lovers of personal growth, this book is a fantastic find.<br /><br />Oh, and it's an entertaining read too. Get your pen and paper out to take notes. You won't be bored!
B00FAXLCWW|5.0|Fantastic Album, we saw them on &#34;Saturday night Live&#34; for the first time and loved them. The Album has not disappointing.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|Very easy to use. Has lots of good features. I've tried a number of calendar/organizer apps but many are too convoluted. I was entering dates and reminders after 5 minutes. I highly recommend this app.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great to see that some of Mr Grisham's most memorable characters are back. That combined with a brilliant<br />story of a legal battle, the age of discrimination in the south, and the lifelike characters of lawyers and clients and<br />town folks was just compelling reading for me. I could not put it down. Please make it it a movie and bring back<br />Matthew and Sutherland...Samuel L as Sistrung, and Spacy as well. Brilliant!
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Excellent James Bond movie.  Best ever.  Bond gets back to his original form and away from the &#34;tormented soul&#34; of the previous flicks.
0142501123|5.0|Very cute. The which continually has problems, and for each problem she has to land, where some creature helps her, and wants to ride the broom.  Finally the broom breaks and a dragon chases the witch, until her hitch hikers get up out of the swamp where the landed, looking like one big monster, which scared away the dragon.
B00006WKSZ|5.0|It's a classic in the Metal genre, back when a live (or better yet, double-live) release was a must. A great intro to some of their more classic material, for those that got into the band around, say, the Blackout Era.  Put a wig on, take off your shirt, crank it to 10, and prance around the house with your favorite air guitar. The solos are a ton of fun.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Imagine Dragons are an up and coming group. Their Lead Singer is fantastic and the album features a wide range of music for everybody.
0307594165|2.0|Toni Morrison is my favorite author, and each time a new novel comes out, I buy it the first day possible.  I have read all of her other novels several times, and I consider Beloved and Jazz (yes, Jazz)  to be American masterpieces.  I have trouble expressing my disappointment with Home.  It feels like a novel a beginning writer might have written, before putting Toni Morrison's name on it.  I find the prose flat; very few sentences rise to the level of Morrison's usual style.  I also find the plot and the characters boring, and these are characters and plot that should not be boring.  I had trouble finishing the novel.  I miss Toni Morrison.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The game is cute, but very similar to others like it. I play it when I do not want to think very much while I am playing.
0316228532|5.0|Nobody is safe in comfortable surroundings with Rowling's raw tale of Krystal Weedon, a teenager from the wrong side of town, whose story is told not only in her words and actions, but in those of her friends, enemies,  teachers,  counselors and adult detractors.  Read this book, and you will never look at poverty, addiction, and broken families in the same way.
0399255370|5.0|The owner of the crayons gets a stack of notes instead of a box of crayons, and in each note, written in the appropriate color, the given crayon complains about their treatment, such as being overused, or not used at all.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting forever for Amazon to get Candy Crush! Both my sister and I have the kindle fire but she has an ipad. she's been playing candy crush for a while kn her ipad. I'm so happy to finally see it and play it. been playing it everyday and can't stop. love it love it love it. thanks amazon.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I was totally stoked when I received it! But I couldn't wait for it so I also rented it to watch on Amazon. LOL!!
B00DNB9RXO|5.0|Let's start with beautiful graphics. Reminds me of a funked up version of Felix the Cat. Some cool music that really fits the look. Now add challenging and different game play. This is one of the more unique Android gaming experiences you'll ever have. Be prepared to be a little frustrated at first but soon you will get the controls and see what is possible and then the game opens up to you.
B008JF8O9M|2.0|When I tried to connect to , first one, then another, then a third printer, the connection failed. I could not find a workaround and do not want to invest any more time in trying.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|A good app for tracking your twitter feed and making posts, but not much more. It doesn't have any filtering features found in unofficial apps.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King was asked what ever happened to the little boy in The Shinning.  This is his answer.  Warning.  It's a follow-on to the book, The Shinning, and not the movie. If you haven't &#34;read&#34; The Shinning, you should read it first.  I have to say I rather enjoyed this.  He was able to present a brand new story, that tied in nicely with the old one, which is quite a feat.
B00CH26TL8|2.0|Fun to play but you keep running out of life and coins.  Not what I would call a &#34;free&#34; game.  I get so frustrated that I don't want to play it anymore.
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|Undoubtedly one of the worst movies I have seen this year.  Lets throw a fake accent on the actor with most potential.  Its riddled with gaps in logic, the worst dialogue, and the worst character development.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This app is awesome.<br />But updating is a pain.<br />If your a fan of Oregon trail GET THIS APP, and a best part it free.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I have read just about every book John Grisham has written. He is a great story teller with amazing insights into not only the legal system, but he also has a handle on the interactions between people. His newest novel--&#34;Sycamore Row&#34;--was not disappointing. It is a great story about Ford County and the people who live there. There are even a few twists and turns in the story that made it interesting. As an author of a dozen books I understand how hard it can be to write a book that holds the readers attention and makes them want to read it up to the last page. This book drew me into the story and made me want to find out how it would end. They need to make a movie about it. I recommend it.<br /><br />Author Den Slattery<br /><br />Here is my link: http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_12?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=den%20slattery&sprefix=den+slattery%2Caps%2C239&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Aden%20slattery
B004SDEP38|1.0|The app lies in its product description. This app does NOT track changes as it claims. You can not toggle track changes on and off and the limited capability of the track changes it does offer is not what any editor requires. I am very disappointed in the app and will be asking Amazon for a refund.
B00BEK6Z7M|3.0|Corri Swanson is not my favorite character by these authors. This novel did nothing to endear her to me. The only real drama arises from her immaturity and poor judgement.<br /><br />Pendergast is barely present in this novel.<br /><br />And the central mystery is a stitched-together conglomeration of little mysteries, none of which are that compelling and which barely hang together.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|The game is fun but you keep running out of life and coins so you have to buy them.  Not what I would call a &#34;free&#34; game.
B001NOOKH6|5.0|One of my favorite movies. From the music, characters, production, everything about this movie is top notch. This is a must have for every Streisand fan.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am not an adolescent by any stretch of the imagination, but I have always had a love of adolescent literature. I hadn't really heard of this book but purchased as an Amazon Bargain for my Kindle. Between purchase and reading it, I began to notice some buzz about it so decided to go ahead and read it. Once started, I couldn't put it down. The portraits of the characters are so strong. It deals honestly with the feelings that surround living a childhood with cancer. It helps us all understand just a little bit more about just wanting to be &#34;normal&#34; and seizing what you can out of life. I imagine that I will read it again. Looking forward to the movie . . . which I am sure will not come close to the book. John Green is an author that I will be reading more of. I've already started following him on Tumbler and You Tube.
0060594888|4.0|Jack Canfield has some wonderful advice in this book. The things he writes about are taken mostly from his own experience. He spent years learning these lessons and now he has compiled them into this book. This is good stuff.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Facebook, how I loathe the. The time suck used to be fun.<br /><br />I have grown sick of one losing the rights to their own content only to make some billionaire even more wealthy. The ever changing privacy controls make the site unsafe. And NOW... Facebook isn't showing your friends your posts unless you pay them. They only show the most &#34;popular&#34; posts in a timeline, so if the first few friends of yours don't &#34;like&#34; your post right away, fat chance anyone will ever see your content... Unless you pay them of course.<br /><br />As to the app? The Mobil app is horrendous. It always freezes, crashes, misses posts costing you lots of time spent composing your thoughts. Since day 1 the app has sucked and it has never gotten better. Don't expect it ever will.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I'm a big SK fan. Thoroughly enjoyed the novel & loved the way it picked up the character of Danny from The Shining.
B000IJ79UW|4.0|For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some quick thoughts on this Superman movie...<br /><br />Superman - The Movie (1978) starring Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, and Gene Hackman is a very solid superhero movie, a very solid Superman movie.  The acting is good, the action is plentiful, and the special effects are great for the time period it was made.  I've seen Superman Returns (2006) and Man Of Steel (2013).  These movies were good, but I prefer the original older ones, including Superman II (1980).  They are just all around better, in my opinion.<br /><br />I'm not really into Superman all that much (I much prefer Batman), but once in a blue moon I'll watch a Superman movie for its entertainment value, and this movie delivers.  Recommended.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|This knife is able to handle rugged and abusive use. It is made well and nearly impossible to damage. If you're looking for an all-around, useful knife, look no further than this baby.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I loved this book. My daughter, who is an ardent feminist, won't read it. Sandberg is the first to say that she grew up white and privileged. So, while her situation may not easily transfer to the rest of us, she does have some good things to say. Whether we want to admit or not, many (not all, mind you) of us DO hold ourselves back. She uses the example of women who STARTING to think of having a family and dial back on going for promotions. I have seen this happen time and again. We can't all make our situations work like Sandberg's does. She has a supportive and helpful mate. But don't we have the option of making that same choice? She clearly says that the most important decision is who you choose as a spouse--if you choose a spouse. She discusses many of the questions we all wrestle with whether we are in big business, small business, or the service industry. We live in a patriarchal society . . . albeit, it needs to change. She clearly states in the beginning that there are two ways to look at equity for women in the workplace. We can change the system or we can move ourselves up within the current system, gain the power, and then change it. So, take it for what it's worth. I liked it. It made me think and that is the purpose, I think. I rarely agree with everything an author has to say, but this book reads fast. There are enough ideas to merit the time spent reading. If nothing else, her high profile has drawn some attention to the idea of gender equity which can evolve into people beginning to question equity in general. Let Sandberg use her high profile (and privileged pedigree) to raise awareness and get people interested in looking more deeply at these issues. The lack of anger in Sandberg's voice is a draw for the general public just as the anger in the voice of many feminist writers drives the public away. Both have merit. Someone has to listen to message for change to occur. More flies with honey, I guess???
B0090SI56Y|3.0|This isn't really the story I thought it would be. I expected the version of Wolverine when he first encounters his Japanese GF from the comic. This is a variation of that story. There is lots of action but not much character development.
B004GYNPL2|3.0|A great app for storing your passwords securely. Available for Android, PC, Mac, and iOS - though it isn't cheap and it really doesn't need to be expensive for what you get. I am a software developer and have worked with encryption quite a bit myself. The work that went into this app doesn't warrant charging 10 bucks for every platform you use it on. I wish they had a buy it once and use it anywhere policy as at 10 bucks, that would be more than fair.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|Good basic graphics, but unfortunately a battery sucker. Would have liked a larger weather icon, too. Possibly more tunes to choose from.
1423489349|5.0|Have used John Thompson Easiest Piano Course for teaching beginning students for years.  It's a great approach and the kids don't get confused with learning the actual notes as opposed to learning that each finger plays a number (assigned that note).. some teachers confuse the kids by learning E is 3, or F is 4...  instead of the learning the position of the note on the staff and it's actual letter name.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|Despite the fact that this is one of Streep's least successful movies, it is a subtle study of human relationships, the conflict between the old and new, and a commentary on the crisis within the church.  In an age where movies about aliens,  vampires, zombies, and secret agents are all too common and movies are filled with gratuitous violence and sex, this movie distinguishes itself, but that fact makes it not for everyone's taste.<br />The performances of Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman are outstanding: they are dramatic treasures.
B008MM9630|3.0|It is fun to play, but there's a lot of waiting for more energy. It's a good game if you're only looking for something to kill a few minutes during the day
0670026638|5.0|I listened to the audiobook, which Ozeki reads. Usually I dislike when authors (other than David Sedaris) read their own books, but this one was brilliantly read.<br /><br />The multiple themes developed in this novel are too many to list! There is just SO much, but it never seems like it while reading.<br /><br />On the surface, it is a story about a somewhat boring woman who finds a journal of someone else and reads her life into being. Beneath the surface, it's:<br />--about time and how time operates;<br />--about writerly agency and how writers are affected by readers and vice versa;<br />--about Buddhism and what being at peace means;<br />--about Japanese history and culture (almost every negative aspect of Japanese culture is raised, but particularly what it is like to be considered &#34;an outsider&#34; in Japanese culture and the bullying that can take place);<br />--about environmentalism (you know that had to show up in an Ozeki novel!);<br />--about children's relationships to their parents:<br />--about suicide and its impact;<br />--about how do deal with one's conscience and shame;<br />--about revisionist history and what constitutes truth;<br />--about closure and whether there is such a thing;<br />--about elderly care (what to do with our parents as they age;<br />--about alienation;<br />--about memory and its loss;<br />--about what constitutes a &#34;successful life&#34;;<br />--about government corruption in the wake of the 2011 Japanese tsunami;<br />--And those are only some of the major themes that show up!<br /><br />Ozeki blends these themes into a single brilliant academic story! I wouldn't recommend it for younger less sophisticated readers or those who like an action-packed plot or who don't enjoy philosophizing about all of the above themes.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|Doesn't get better than this. Okay, well, maybe it does, but Carcassonne is a fantastic game for the whole family. The app is flawless and even easier than the board game as it adds the points for you. Highly recommended.

1609611543|5.0|OMG!!!!OMG!!!!OMG!!! This book is incredible! After decades of trying to lose weight, control Type II diabetes, and get my health back - and after a fortune spent on diet books and cookbooks - THIS is the one for me. I've been researching on how multinational American Big Food corporations, along with government subsidies for agriculture and a deeply flawed USDA recommendation on how we Americans should be eating, is the root of our horrible state of our national health. This book explains how the American diet of processed foods is literally killing us against our wishes. I adopted a wheat-and-sugar-free diet, and withing days started losing weight, became more energized, and feel incredibly optimistic that this is the way I'm supposed to live. Dr. Davis includes a vast amount of excellent science explaining how GMO wheat is destroying not only the lives of Americans, but also has made its way around the globe and is causing the same devastating problems in other nations. Why? CORPORATE PROFIT for the evil triumvirate: Big Ag, Big Food, and Big Pharma. If you are suffering like I was, please buy this book (and the excellent books by Dr. Mark Hyman, such as &#34;The Blood Sugar Solution&#34;).
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is dystopian, but it’s not a terrible dystopia, at first, people who live there don’t recognize it as one. It’s home. For many pages I thought of this as a mystery, because one of the characters wonders and tries to puzzle out what has happened to other characters. She’s an engineer, so she comes to the mysteries, as flaws in the design, or machines that need repair. Juliette is a likeable, skilled, mature woman; it was a delight to read a book about her. To be fair though, it is not all about Juliette. This novel is five novellas set in Silo 18; some in Silo 17, and the first two aren’t about Juliette at all. There are fifty silos, we are later told, that go 150+ floors down, where humans are stored like seed. We don’t know what has happened outside, but it’s bad and it was a loooong time ago. But as much as I liked this one, I feel no driving need to read more about this universe.

B0060D31N4|2.0|Making Prospero into a female character is a bold but ill-conceived move. Theirs is not a mother-daughter relationship at all and Prospera's rant against sexism makes for a strange bedfellow with Shakespeare, considering the many years that separate the Renaissance from the Women's Movement. Best word to describe it: weird.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I enjoyed following the lawyers' thought processes as they went through the case to figure out the truth of the matter at hand.  This is the first book I've read about wills and estates being contested in court so I enjoyed the new knowledge I gained from the read. Even though I figured out the plot before it was revealed, it was still interesting to see how the author would lead his characters to the truth and then present it at court. I also enjoyed reading about court proceedings and jury selection strategy. I liked the plot, the characters, and of course, the book was well written.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very intense, lots of action. Read it twice. I will be reading Catching Fire, and The Mocking Jay again too!
B004SDSSFY|1.0|Product description lies about track changes. This app does NOT allow you to track changes, contrary to the product description.

She was naive as Bruno as  kid and us had to sort out the horrible realities of what went on that she  knew nothing about. This book captured that and humanized a horrible situation that friendship brought some healing to.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|Room Book Review<br /> Emma Donoghue shows what a great writer she can be in this book. This is the first book of hers I have read, and I was very impressed. She has written many other books like Slammerkin that were rated very high, but not as highly rated as Room. I have read several books about children, but this is the first where I can actually understand what the child is thinking. This makes little Jack a much more compelling and interesting character to read about. The book in my opinion is a great read because it is dark, exciting, and heart-warming all at the same time.  Life in his eleven by eleven foot Room is all little Jack has ever known. He was born there, and has lived there all of his life. Every day he and his Mother (Ma) have their own routine where they do exercise, watch television, eat meals, and go to bed. But they never leave the Room. When they go to bed some days Old \\"Nick\\" comes in the night, and sleeps with Jacks Ma. One day when Ma tells Jack that Old \\"Nick\\" kidnapped her when she was very young the two of them try and come up with an escape plan. When the plan works Jack finds himself in a new world that he is unsure he likes. Jack and his Ma went through some of the most devastating circumstances ever imagined. Now five year old Jack has to adjust to the real world, and all the new things he never knew existed.  I believe this book is so interesting to read because of the Protagonist (Jack). The protagonist is the leading hero in a work of literature, and Jack is a great hero to have because he is almost always positive in spite of his nightmarish circumstances. When his Ma is having a bad day he says things like, \\"Do you want to play with me, Jeep, and Remote? We will cheer you up\\" (Donoghue 44).  Jack also is the one who is able to get him and his Ma both out of their \\"Dungeon\\". Without him, he and his mother would had never escaped. I believe this is a great example of being heroic. Like Jacks Ma says, \\"You are very brave, JackerJacker\\" (Donoghue 154). At the ending of the book Jack also displays unique courage, and this courage gives the book a satisfying conclusion.  If you enjoy stories of people in terrible odds, and still finding a way to be happy then this book is for you. If you dislike books that are dark and disturbing I would not recommend Room. In my opinion this book is very heart-warming and satisfying because of the bond you build with the characters. Room is one of my favorite books on shelves today if I were you I would go out and give it a shot.

1582701709|4.0|It was a really inspiring book but left you wanting more information.  But, it was still an very good book.  I purchased the book after seeing the video and I probably would have enjoyed the book more had I not seen the video first.  If you are going to purchase both I would recommend that you read the book before watching the video.  Both are really good.
0307352153|5.0|Everyone who is or wants to be a leader should read this book. No, everyone should read it. Great insight.
1250012570|5.0|Writing a review for this book has been incredibly difficult for me. My first review for it was one word. Just, &#34;Eff.&#34; Then I expanded it to three words, &#34;Holy Effing Eff.&#34; Then I thought really long and hard about it, and decided that this book deserved many, many, many more words.<br /><br />See, here's the thing: Poverty is very hard to honestly describe. While I was still a supervisor for a homeless shelter, I often looked for books that I thought I could give to our residents to help them pass the painfully long hours of the day. This was doubly true for the teens, who were hit with the double whammy of being homeless as well as often being years behind in reading. I can still remember the time that I allowed myself to be roped into reading the Twilight Saga so that I could talk books with one of them.<br /><br />Ye Gods.<br /><br />I cannot say, with words at least, how much I wish this book had existed then.<br /><br />Let me say again that poverty is so painfully difficult to describe with any honesty, without sounding psychotic or like you are exaggerating. It's even harder to explain the complex emotions that go along with poverty, or the way that they shape who you are and change you. To respond to the question, &#34;why do you always seem angry?&#34; with &#34;because I'm poor&#34; sounds crass. To respond to the girls in the locker room teasing your hair for being crap with, &#34;it's because I'm poor&#34; seems ridiculous. To explain the fact that your clothes don't fit and you always look weird with, &#34;well, we've talked about how poor I am&#34; is just so. Intensely. Lame. No one gets it unless they've washed their clothes by hand in cold water using dish soap, or rubbed vanilla behind their ears to cover the smell of lack-of-soap. But Rainbow Rowell paints this incredibly vivid picture of how poverty shapes not just Eleanor's world but Eleanor as a character, and it is perfect. I mean, this book is the effing Statue of David of books. Rowell is the effing Michelangelo of writers.<br /><br />I have to admit I'm just the slightest bit bitter, because if I ever publish anything I know it will not hold a candle to the absolute priceless beauty of this story. God help me. I cannot imagine how to do it better.<br /><br />But back to the story itself. Eleanor is a girl living in abject poverty, having just moved back in with the mother who has lost her sense of self and the uncle who drinks away all the money needed to keep the kids in clothes with bellies full. Top that off with being the new girl in school, and you've got a pretty toxic situation that all of the kids back at the shelter know all too cruelly well. But Eleanor's saving grace might just be the boy who reluctantly lets her sit next to him on the bus, the cool, stable, upper-middle class Park. Their unlikely friendship turns into a bittersweet teen romance which turns so many stereotypes on their heads.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil a second of the story, but let's just say that my favorite moment is the second best Star Wars reference in literature. (The best still belongs to the fabulous Gae Polisner.) This book made me laugh and cry like an idiot at work, and I didn't even mind because if anyone had asked me what was up I could've shoved the book on them in giggly tearful fangirl glory and sat on them until they read it so we could talk about how absolutely perfect it is.<br /><br />No, really. I'm a college student and a mother of three and work part time and all my money is the most precious money in the world, but I will spend that precious money on spare copies of this book because the next time a student at work tells me that no one really understands what it's like to be poor and just trying to make your life worth living, and they just want to give up hope, I will give them this book and say, &#34;someone gets it.&#34;<br /><br />Someone gets it.<br /><br />Sometimes, that is priceless.<br /><br />Sometimes, it's all youneed.<br /><br />This book could not be more highly recommended. Five big fat smacks-you-in-the-feels-and-you-love it stars, but 5 isn't enough.

1579128955|3.0|This is a gorgeous book with a lot of interesting information.  I use it as a resource for writing trivia questions about the elements, but I have one major complaint.  The doggone book does not contain the periodic table!  So, how can one scan the elements to determine which one to read about?  Plus, placement on the table reveals so much about each element.  I urge the author and editors to include the full periodic table at the beginning of any new editions of this tome.

B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|I really enjoyed playing the free version of the game. I really wanted to continue on so I went to unlock the rest of the game. To my surprised the game was $5. I just couldn't bring myself to spend that kind of money for a game app. I thought maybe there was something more to the game for this price so I checked the reviews and everyone else was saying it was too short for the cost and there was nothing else to it to be worth that much money...especially when there are lots of other awesome games out there for much less.<br /><br />If it comes down in price or it goes on sale I will definitely purchase the whole thing. But for now the free version is as far as I go.

B0079XPUOW|5.0|If you're a fan of Star Trek, Star Wars, or Galactica read this book. It is greatly entertaining and sometimes thought provoking.
B00CRWJ7VC|3.0|The plotline is sometimes hard to follow.  The plausibility of the story and some of the gaps in the story make it difficult to suspend belief.  The constantly changing characters is confusing - and using the same actors to portray various characters throughout the story became a distraction from the storyline itself.
B00957T6X6|3.0|Reading all the review's, I wonder how many of them made it all the way through all 5 volumes?  I thought the first 3 books were good but the 4th and 5th books are very different.  They are actually 1 book split up into 2 parts and not necessarily in chronological order.  The pace slows way down and you get very detailed accounts of what is happening to each character.  Some are in one book, others in the next. This is good for some of the characters but boring for others.  It feels like you're trapped in the last two volumes and the only way to get out is to keep slogging through.  At least it gives you something to do this winter.
B0074MTTEK|4.0|One reviewer on the back cover said that Nessa Carey's \\"book combines an easy style with a textbook's thoroughness....A bold attempt to bring epigenetics to a wide audience.\\" While it is an easy style, it is not an easy read. It becomes very technical in some parts. Her writing is seasoned with occasional light-hearted quips and plenty of interesting narratives. Maybe her book could have been made more user-friendly for the layman if she had put the very technical material in appendices and kept the warm, friendly chats in the main text. Such a tactic might help the less-technically-minded reader peruse her book if her intent was to capture a wide audience.<br /><br />Is it possible that acquired characteristics can be inherited to the third, or even the fourth generation? Carey thinks so. She quotes Exodus 20:5, \\"For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sins of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me Exodus,\\" as a segue for chapter 6, \\"The Sins of the Fathers.\\" She assures the reader that acquired characteristic can be passed on to several generations of offspring. In a narrowly defined sense, Lamarck was correct. Biology professors taught me that Lamarck was wrong, that acquired characteristics were not passed from parents to offspring, and that all inherited traits were based strictly and squarely on DNA.<br /><br />Nessa Carey insists \\"that for some very specific situations Lamarckian inheritance is taking place, and we have a handle on the molecular mechanism behind it.\\" (p. 110) The mechanism of epigenetics involves the methylation of DNA or histones. Methylation involves the attachment of a methyl group (-CH3) to the target molecule. There is also acetylation, phosphorylation, and other chemical modifications of DNA or histones that moderate the activity of genes.<br /><br />On her website, Carey explains epigenetics this way:<br /><br />\\"Every time we see two things which are genetically identical, but which aren't the same, we're seeing epigenetics in action. This affects huge amounts of life on earth and has a big impact on human health. The science is weird, heretical and fascinating.\\"<br /><br />You have probably heard, \\"You are what you eat.\\" In the case of honeybees, this is undoubtedly true. Carey explains how queen bees become queens and how worker bees (also female) become workers. She says that a virgin queen mates with several male bees (drones) before settling down to produce a hive of new bees. The drones usually come from other hives and very seldom from the same hive as the virgin queen. Nevertheless, a hive contains thousands of genetically identical bees. (p. 283) Of course, there are thousands of others that are genetically different from the group that is identical. Nevertheless, how does a larval bee become a queen rather than a worker?<br /><br />Dr. Carey explains that young worker bees (nurse bees) feed all honeybee larvae royal jelly for the first three days after hatching. After that time, nurse bees feed royal jelly to only the larvae that are to become queens. She says that no one understands why the nurse bees continue to feed royal jelly to only a few of the larvae. Who decides which larvae should become queens? Maybe there is some genetic or epigenetic tag that clues the worker bees. Carey doesn't suggest this.The pattern of early feeding completely deter¬mines whether a larva will develop into a worker or into a queen.<br /><br />This scenario \\"just SHRIEKS epigenetics,\\" remarks Carey [emphasis added].<br /><br />I thought her discussion about rat babies who received much maternal care vs. the babies of mother rats who were lackadaisical at licking and grooming was very interesting. The well-nurtured babies became well-adjusted, calmer adults, while the less-nurtured babies became stressed-out adults. Carey describes several experiments that rule out purely genetic and psychological outcomes of maternal care. One might supposethat giving a juvenile rat a nurturing environment might improve the laid-back response to stress, but Carey leaves no doubt that good nurturing during the first week of a rat's life causes epigenetic changes. She said that \\"being licked and groomed by the mother set off a chain of events that led to epigenetic changes in the cortisol receptor gene.\\" (p. 241)<br /><br />She explains how experimenters determined this. For instance, baby rats that had nurturing mothers were switched to lackadaisical mothers after the first week of life. These babies still displayed the calmer, laid-back traits when subjected to stress as adults. Babies of lackadaisical mothers were switched to nurturing mothers, and they became stressed-out adults.<br /><br />Dr. Carey examined the relationship between various diseases and epigenetic events. Is it possible that cancers could be cured if the right promoter regions of genes were methylated or demethylated? She explains that trying to prevent cancer via epigenetic modification could create worse problems for the patient. Even using epigenetics to promote longevity might actually cause cancer and early death.<br /><br />The relationships in genetics and epigenetics are finely tuned, and as a creationist, I see the interdependent relationships as indicators of God's handiwork. Carey sees the same things as products of a long process of evolution.<br /><br />Carey, like most evolutionists, believes that evolution produced the epigenetic systems. Presumably, because her book is about epigenetics and not evolution, she doesn't back up her occasional claims that epigenomes evolved. On the other hand, Thomas Woodward and James Gills claim the epigenome was designed in their book The Mysterious Epigenome: What Lies Beyond DNA.that giving a juvenile rat a nurturing environment might improve the laid-back response to stress, but Carey leaves no doubt that good nurturing during the first week of a rat's life causes epigenetic changes.

B0035LMTZA|4.0|Didn't know what to expect when I started watching, but this was a good movie.  Glad I clicked it on to watch.
B008GJV4F2|5.0|Juliette Binoche was convincing, and charming as Vian, the unique chocolatiere who wanders from town to town with daughter in tow because of her mysterious South American/French heritage.  She portrays tenderness, stubborness, ambition, and persistance very well.  Alfred Molina (shows the true range of his acting, especially if you've seen him in &#34;Frida) as the charming, exacting, rigid Comte (Count) and Mayor of this small town who regards religiousity if not compassion as a virtue and comes to find otherwise.  Johnny Depp, as always, is charming, fascinating and a wonderful counter for Vianne  Judy Dench portrays her crabby, diabetic landlady with great elan.  I wish I could make my holiday purchases from her chocolate shop.  Fun to see Leslie Caron (Gigi), now an older lady (still beautiful) in a cameo role!!
1603427244|5.0|So far this little book hasn't let me down!  I have been able to find clear, concise instructions on many new ways to cast on and bind off every time!!  The descriptions are very helpful and the organization of the book is excellent!  There is a wealth of information for knitters in this little book!
B001152TL6|1.0|A film that, despite some notable efforts to scramble us keep finally a very classic scenario. One finds as always the eternal hero who dispensed justice himself. Mafia, police , army, all this is of course one and the same thing since feudal times.<br />In this film, Lynch 's work is once again questioning the watcher about the limits of identity. Significant gaps stripping the man of his personality or otherwise dangerous reconciliations conducting to the merger between two characters , the viewer finds himself tossed back into a total slump.<br /><br />We must therefore accept the link between the two main actors who nevertheless doesn't occur at any time, their only common point being to love the same woman and have the same bad people against them.<br />Note also the Manichean confinement scenario in a sequence in the middle of the film where the big bad boss freely attack an innocent driver accused to stick too close to the bumper .<br /><br />Till this childish and vulgar end where an analogy is made between our vigilante who's followed on the road by a pack of cops and his wife when she is taken doggy style during mafia pornography sessions , all of which being supported by the disturbing music of the metal band Rammstein where a voice barely edgy dominates solid electric guitar riffs executed methodically.
B006GKHE6G|2.0|Yep, it does.  Didn't like the controls either.  Give me Stickman Downhill any day.  Probably fun if it worked well.  I don't get it.  Beach Buggy Blitz works fine.
B00006JIA4|5.0|Every song you want to hear (and more) is on this great collection. Freddie Mercury was a genius. Enough said.
B00CDCE9L4|5.0|Love it!  The location is great and the insight into the faith is interesting. I did not know much about the history of this people.
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|Roberto Benigni was fantastic in this poignant, sweet and sad tale of the Holocaust and how he triumphed in the end against adversity.
B004U8VX2M|4.0|After Downton Abbey, to return to this production does reveal some seams. Not bad for being the first of its kind.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I play daily with kindle fire HD 7 .  For anyone having issues with updates, you just need to remove the application and download  it again.  You won't lose your progress and it will automatically update.  This game is just like Country Life on Facebook only 5x better.  Great game for all ages.  This game is by far my favorite from all other applications.  Give it 5 star!!!
B0039NCJFO|5.0|This is one of my favorites, if not my favorite American Pie film. It is absolutely hilarious and worth your time.<br /><br />I definitely suggest watching all four movies in order. (American Pie (this one), American Pie 2, American Wedding, and American Reunion) They have the same cast for each movie and the movies build on each other. The spinoffs (Naked Mile, Band Camp, and Beta House) have different cast members but the same general theme. The three spinoff movies are also funny, but not nearly as good as the other four.<br /><br />If you watch the unrated version, do prepare yourself for nudity.<br /><br />I have watched this movie a few times and it makes me laugh every time.
B008Y6M9R4|5.0|Despite a somewhat overloaded screenplay, I think this is a first-rate crime story.  Casey Affleck and Michelle Monoghan are ideal as Kinsey and Gennaro in this adaptation of Dennis Lehane's equally fine novel.  The film version is almost up to the task of combining strong statements about corruption on both sides of the law with a tense, fast-paced procedural that plays fair while keeping the adrenaline flowing throughout.  In my opinion this is a real sleeper, well worth repeated viewings.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|having just seen the movie, decided to read the book since they are always better. this was no exception. looking forward to reading the next book on the series.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|this is very intertaing game and a good challenge. I really like it. I give it a five star rating
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A beautiful story of growth and love. It was very touching, sad and also uplifting. I highly recommend reading the book.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Absolutely love this product. Only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because I was unable to set it up at my mom's house when I was at home for the holidays, that was disappointing.
B00DYOOGYK|4.0|I would have given this game a five star, but I docked a star because in the menus their is SO MANY ADS!! It's every two seconds you exit out of an ad, only to have the same ad come up again!! I find this really frustrating and so I give it a four.<br /><br />This game still has really fun gameplay and I recommend it to people who like to play gta 5.
B00B2OSZIW|5.0|The Fuji XE1 (& XE2) camera is easy enough to HOLD, but impossible to really GRIP. That is, you only feel safe using it when the camera's neckstrap is also attached. This add-on grip entirely eliminates that sense that the camera could just slip out of your hands. The accessory is very well made (it's actually a FUJI brand accessory). It attaches and detaches in about five seconds, and does not make the camera look any larger. It's too bad Fuji didn't simply integrate the grip into the camera body itself, rather than making it a (grossly overpriced) add-on.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|good chemistry between actors and twists and turns in episodes make this series rather addicting. I really like the character Eli Gold.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The book meets the first 2 sentences test as it's written beautifully, honestly and cleverly. Jojo Moyes delivers a sweet and endearing book that tugs at your emotions while posing &#34;what would you do if?&#34; Could not put the book down and will be reading more Moyes.
B0094K1PW4|4.0|Enjoyable. A sci-fi movie that I would allow my grandchildren to watch. It is typical J.J. Abrams stuff. (I am getting a little tired of J.J.)
B00EOARZ4G|4.0|I'll be honest -- nearly every Clancy novel since Red October, and every novel since Without Remorse, has always felt a bit inferior to its predecessors. However, I found this book to be a notch above many of his later works and an enjoyable read.  Kind of a popcorn novel on par with Rainbow Six, it feels designed for a video game or a movie-in-waiting, but the way Command Authority is written keeps it moving at a fairly steady pace.
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|I am so glad I chose to wait for the extended version. The story is grand and the writers included more of the &#34;back story&#34; then The Hobbit book. The colors are brilliant, the costumes detailed... everything you'd expect from Peter and the Lord of the Ring folks. Great job, I can't wait for the next movie in the theater.
B008AWBQGW|5.0|Probably one of the best CD's of new Skynyrd in many years, After I heard them perform some of the songs live [Elgin, IL Oct. 2013] I went right home and bought it. NO regrets. !!!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Great and fun game I love it glad to have this game available on my phone and kindle and I like the fact that they sync
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I love it because it puts me right to sleep soothing and so different you can mix up the sounds.
B00AO3K01C|4.0|It was a most unusual book which was set in Japan and Canada and had two narrators. This gave the reader some relief from the often unbearable happenings in Japan. In some ways it was a coming of age book but it also sought to look at the fallout of the Japanese tsunami.The violence and bullying and the constant threat of suicide was fairly full_on but it was believeable.Though some of the themes were a bit grim it was written with a certain optimism which may come from the Buddist author. I intend to give it to a few people for Christmas,it was a really interesting read.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Upgraded from an older 2008 MBPro so I have two extra power blocks.  Really wish I didn't need to buy this.  Disappointed in Apple.  However it works perfectly.
B000083E79|5.0|Great CD.  If you're a CHER fan, you probably have all these, but nice to have these &#34;BESTS&#34; on one CD.
B00GP3NCYC|5.0|It is enjoyable to all ages.  I'm 66 and watched it with my grand daughter and we both laughed a lot.
B00FATEJYE|4.0|This game is cool but it's laggy other than that I really like this game I would suggest getting this game if you have a lot of memory
B00571F26Y|5.0|One of those books that I hardly could put down til I have red the hole book. Now that I know what havoc wheat plays in the body and how one was lied to so that money hungry people can enrich themselves at my cost, I am avoiding it like the plaque. I am also informing people as I go along my daily activities.
B0040QYROA|5.0|Awesome. The iconography is in depth and is easy to use almost 90 years after the production. Certainly the messages are timeless.
B00FG1Q5J8|5.0|I backed this off of Kickstarter and to this day I do NOT regret backing this game at all! Its a very fun very addicting RPG space game worth every cent! I even got my six year old daughter playing it now. Controls take some time to get use too but one you have em down fun to play. This game had its bugs and issues but what games don't? It's slowly taking shape to become one of my continuous favs. Highly recommend downloading!
B00F2362IE|4.0|This is fun and a nice way to spend some time relaxing.  The game works well on kindle.<br />Makes me smile and love Turtles! LOL
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|The kids (all teens) loved the series.  They want to watch it again and again.  We (the parents) thought it was pretty good as well.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Very good book I recommend it!  The style of writing is interesting and captures you right away.  I am excited to see what they did with the movie now.
B00BFTV09K|5.0|This book is a real eye opener and after I red it I am making so sure that I don't buy anything with all the rubbish in the ingredient list. I found that a lot of my allergy symptoms had disappeared and the constant feeling of tiredness and sluggishness has disappeared. I am so thankful  for all the research Michael has put into this book so that we the ordinary people can have the knowledge and the benefit.
B00ENXBUR2|5.0|Great collectors pack for a great movie.  The case makes a really nice display piece in the entertainment center.  Nice!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's hilarious to watch the minion run and scream!! ;-)<br />It's awsome that they add new sences every holiday or event.
B003477DVK|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies about being a kid. Never fails to bring back the memories of my dog. It really tugs at your heart.
B005SODYGA|5.0|I love this band beyond belief.  I love this collection.  That's really all there is to it.  Absolute classic stuff.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Can be very frustrating, games should be fun. Some levels seem impossible and can take days, then will suddenly clear, and you are not sure why.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I don't watch much TV, but I could not resist Downton Abbey for its intelligent, high quality story line.  If there were more shows like this one, I could become a TV addict.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Very good novel even though it was too much like the original story (the Shining), but it was still entertaining. The end was anti-climatic.
1455525839|5.0|A MOST PERFECT STOCKING STUFFER.  Not only do Pendergast and Swanson operate in sub-zero temps, but all the action happens around Christmas.  These Guys are Marketing Geniuses.....and Even  Better Writers !! A Must Read.
B000AP04FG|3.0|I love both of these Actors. I liked the intent, but sometimes the relationship aspect got in the way. Angelina playing off her man is not representative of her strong character and Brad seemingly castrated by his love did not play well for me. Strong women can love and respect strong men.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|Cher is back and stronger then ever with this new release. It's evident by this release that Cher is one of those artist whos voice doesn't weaken with age like some do.
B0031QNDUO|5.0|This is a Classic movie, the very best of all the Miracle on 34th St movies. Love all the actors, perfect casting.
B006GKHE6G|5.0|The only minus is you don't seem to be able to go just one lap.<br />Otherwise, it rocks.<br />You can customize your ride, and the physics are accurate.<br />Awesome jumps, too.
B004NELBPC|5.0|if you like the Huff then this is a good way to read it .  It is layed out nicely sometimes slow to update but that could be my connection too.
B00AG51V8E|4.0|Maybe I went in with low expectations but I liked this movie. I guess I don't have to worry about spoiling anything. The other reveiws already did that.  This would make a good movie series for cavill. This is a Henry cavill movie not a Bruce Willis movie.  Bruce just does cameos these days to get the movie noticed. Don't get me wrong I am a big Willis fan but this is a cavill movie.
B004BJMEO6|3.0|This was a good movie that had too much sex and not enough love. There was no depth of feeling between the two lovers as the two dominant beauties were not committed to love.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Highly addictive and fun!  Team Lava support rocks.  This game is great for those who like Tiny Monsters and<br />My Singing Monsters.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I wanted a way to easily watch Google Play Movies On my television. Roku wouldn't do it. The setup couldn't be easier. Plug the device into the TV. Install the app on your phone. Open the app and follow the instructions. It's great for watching YouTube videos and Netflix as well. I highly recommend this. It does require a wifi connection.
B001YV504U|5.0|Still an all-time classic and I am very pleased with the Blu-ray. Good quality video and a few good special features. Good purchase!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|sometimes I read just for readings sake. The escape is \\"therapy\\" to me.<br />then every once we in a while a book comes along that  consumes me. This book and these people I will never forget.
B008JFUREC|1.0|I purchased this for my friend's five-year-old son, a kid who falls perfectly into the film's target audience. He was thrilled! He loves the Smurfs (to the point where he will even debate with you as to whether the cartoon show or the CGI movies are better).<br /><br />Unfortunately, he and I can now agree on one thing smurf-related; the Smurfs 2 really smurfed. For him, it was boring. For me, it was painful.<br /><br />First, The movie uses the word \\"smurf\\" excessively. It's smurfing smurfety smurfness was not a pleasure to listen to. In fact, many of the phrases in the film used to cater to adult humor just plain fell flat.<br /><br />Now, the basic plot is that Gargamel kidnaps Smurfette in order to get the formula that will turn the Naughties - named Vexy and Hackus - into `real' Smurfs. The other smurfs and Neil Patrick Harris want to get Smurfette back. Smurfette spends the movie struggling with whether to help the Naughties and whether she likes being a nice little Smurfette.<br /><br />This would seem all well and good, if the movie actually vetted out the plot in a slightly less obvious way. The 5 year old predicted what would happen about ten minutes in. And when faced with Smurfette's conundrum, he asked \\"Why doesn't she just bring them back to the Smurf Village and be friends. Everybody's naughty sometimes\\"<br /><br />Good question...and something I address in the spoiler below.<br /><br />Yes, the Naughties are amusing characters and they really raise that age-old question of why be good, when being naughty is much more fun. It is the Naughties who supply the only interesting comedic bits of this film, while Gargamel is relegated to slapstick and it is the Naughties who are really the heart of this film. Sadly, watching Smurfette figuring out whether she wants to help the Naughties and thus indirectly help Gargamel, was basically like having viewers watch her argue with mini devil and mini angel versions of herself.<br /><br />Now, I know this movie is intended for kids. Which is why I normally go into such films with the thought of sit back, relax, and just giggle when you see a talking cat. It's fun to be able to share laughter with kids and see the light in their eyes when they are enjoying themselves, the way you used to enjoy watching this stuff. Kids movies aren't supposed to be crazy complicated. They also aren't meant to cater to adult humor. But they should make a kid happy, or sad, or excited about what's on the screen.<br /><br />The Smurfs 2 didn't do that for the kid I bought this for. He thought that Smurfette was being \\"stupid\\" and that Gargamel wasn't any fun this time around. And I have to agree with him.<br /><br />Spoiler:<br /><br />The thing that really peeved me and perhaps the main reason this film is getting one instead of two stars from me, is the message this movie sends to kids. The whole movie is about finding a formula to change the skin color of the Naughties because doing so will make them good, not bad. AKA the reason Smurfette can't bring the Naughties back to the Smurfs is because they aren't blue. Because they aren't blue they are bad and it's why they act naughty. And of course, in the end, the Naughties are accepted by the Smurfs village ONLY AFTER THEY CHANGE THEIR SKIN COLOR, and thus, have become good.<br /><br />What a great message to send to a little boy, right?<br /><br />In short, it's a sad day for the Smurfs.intended for kids.

B000W4KT64|5.0|This was a good movie, better than the original. John Travolta was excellent and Byrnes did what may be her best work and maybe on screen her last.
0740797719|5.0|easy to read and keeps you interested.  The things he teaches seem like they would be common sense but are very informative.  this man really knows his stuff.  A classic for any collections.
B005F8CL1S|5.0|A great buy, 11 of Cohen's earliest albums remastered for CD and all of his early songs, a real treasure.  He is a true poet and a great singer, one of the best of his generation.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is very addictive... once I played it on my friends I was waiting for it to  come out on the kindle and it finally did. So you should get this game . Very good
B00BSB2AE4|4.0|The text hits pretty close to home on many occasions and the pictures are hilarious. I'm pretty sure she has my dog ;)
B009LDD5E0|5.0|I love this season of Glee. I am an avid Glee fan and i like to have all the seasons on DVD. This season did take a little longer than the others to get to me but other than that, i am very satisfied.
B00CJGP116|5.0|Marc Anthony I don't understand much Spanish, but I do love this CD. He performed on the Latin Grammys and wowed me. The CD does not disappoint.
B00FVVR2ZO|4.0|Yay!  Mirrors is finally on the kindle, I'm so happy but so sad that it isn't updated.  We updates asap please!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This game is ok. Too slow paced for my liking, you often just have to click on everything to find the key, clue.
B003CH9PTU|5.0|My husband talked me into watching this. I never would have watch this on my own, but I'm glad I did. It is so well done and covers so many tough issues without judgement: drugs, crime, facing death...  Unlike a lot of shows, drugs are not glamorized. If you know anyone thinking of cooking (or using) meth, tell them to watch this show. THe characters are real rather than pretty, they look like your neighbors. They are not &#34;cool&#34; like sit com characters and they have to face the consequences of their actions.<br /><br />The script and scenes are genius. Odd camera angles and funky time lapses add to the story rather than distract from it. The characters are excellent,  even the characters that are despicable you want to see more of because they are so well-written.<br /><br />Warning: There are some intense scenes, violence, nudity (not pretty nude people usually either) and bad language. It feels like real life in the drug scene.<br /><br />I'm into the 4th season now. Season 1 is very mild in comparison. They get more intense with each season. Season 1 is only edgy, this series gets dark quickly.
B0084IHVC0|4.0|grand kids like this movie very much and watch it at least 3 times a week.  thank you very much
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|best game ever! it is so much fun. I think everyone should play this game. even Adam lavine loves this game.
B004M9ZI0M|2.0|I watched this movie a couple of times trying to get a sense of where it was going and never found the journey worth the time. Helen Mirren was good in a bad part.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game! And it is very addicting its worth getting it. Trust me! You can even be friends with people and look at other villages!!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I like that the jewels are slightly larger, so easy to see, follow.  I like that there are 3 styles of games, so depending on my mood, I can choose which one to play.  I also like that I can replay levels in arcade so I can attempt to improve, better my score.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Handy app - good to know how much time I have left for various activities (particularly reading). Nice graphics. Would recommend. I did get this for free, though. Not sure I would pay the current listed price - maybe up to 99p.
B00138F7NS|4.0|I give such a high rating because every single song is a pleasure to listen to.  It also had an eclectic mix which keeps the album interesting.  It never gets boring.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I was surprised how this worked. I have a Android RAZR so it worked great using my phone. The downside is I had use a USB extendion cord to power it my TV does not have a USB and my outlet was far away. I mainly use Netflix and YouTube so I can not rate the other services available.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|Anyone who hasn't experienced Errol Flynn as the dashing Robin Hood is in for a treat. This movie is the standard by which all other Robin Hood films should be judged.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I am enjoying the game but am still very slow. I was hoping for some more variety...maybe I'm missing some links I haven't discovered yet. Sure enjoy winning the random draw games!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I don't like the limit on number of moves or the number of attempts, having to wait days and or hours to retry is annoying.  I liked time d games and puzzles which is why I didn't say I hated it.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|Best xmen movie yet!! i am really glad I have it. Great addition to my superhero movie collection.  Can't wait for sequal.
B000N2HCKQ|4.0|What if you had the resource to understand how other people's minds adopt ideas? Well hell...now you do! This is the Inception movie in a &#34;for dummies&#34; format
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Great Holiday movie for the family would recommend to anyone.  Will make you believe in Christmas all over again enjoy :)
B00A8ECU24|4.0|It takes place when nightmare moon awakens and throughout the game more recent things and quests appear. You can travel to Canterlot for the preparations of the royal wedding for shining armor and cadence. Twilight gets her wings when she has completed starswirled the beardeds abandon spell. You have to buy twilight crown with gems. There is a blue and purple mirror in the corner and if you click on it your at canterlot high form Equestrian Girls. HOPE MY INFORMATION WAS HELPFUL HAVE FUN! :D
0765348276|5.0|A great book that kept me entertained the entire read.  Hard time putting it down.  If you like Sci Fi then get this book.
B000URWYTS|2.0|A fantasy. I was surprised to discover that it was not a bio of FLW. And then, iabout 1/3 of the way through, my Kindle started widening it's margins until the type blocks until only a single, vertical line of letters wa s left.  Only for this book.. Wha hoppen? So Loving Frank went back into the iKindleDX  Cloud.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Yes, it's a few years old, but still extremely relevant.  Thankfully, it's on amazon prime so I'm hoping more people watch it and become more aware about the scary changes to our food supply and help make changes for the better.  For our future and our children's futures.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|First off AMAZING book. It touched on very relevant topics and didn't use cliches or anything cheesy. The characters are perfect and very relatable I could totally relate to Hazel. I love her attitude. Now warning the book might be awesome but it will rip your heart out in the end. I never cry during books but this time I did.  I just couldn't believe what happened. Overall great book just be prepared for your heart to be broken!
0375714839|4.0|After reading Maus, I was recommended to check out another nonfiction graphic novel set: Persepolis by Marjane Satrapi.<br /><br />Persepolis is a set of 2 books, Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood & Persepolis 2: The Story of a Return, that tell Marjane's story.<br /><br />Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood is about Marjane's life as a child growing up in Iran during the Islamic Revolution.  It's complicated, dark at time, yet funny, too.  Marjane isn't a &#34;perfect child&#34; - she's real, hilarious, and outgoing.  Marjane experiences life being rich and free, with religious changes forcing girls into burkas and the lack of interaction with boys.<br /><br />Persepolis 2: The Story of a Return begins in 1984 when Marjane flees Iran to spend years in Vienna, without her family.  Marjane struggles with her identity, becoming a follower amongst her friends, and even dealing drugs a little bit at one point.  When her life becomes kind of hopeless, she ends up returning to Iran to be with her family, even though the rules are stifling her.<br /><br />These graphic novels were easy to read and understand.  I feel like Marjane's story is relatable and also informative.  At times, I was confused about some of the history, but she tries to explain what happens when in a simple way.<br /><br />I still think that the Maus books should be your first graphic novel experience, if you are new and want to try, but these are a great nonfiction second!<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br /><br />Rebecca @ Love at First Book
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Loads fast, fast game play - my only complaint is that it does not allow you the 3 free moves from friends bonus like the computer version (it tells you when you get one from friends, just never makes those available for game).
B00EKR61FM|5.0|Love this special edition boxed set. So many extras and such lovely keepsake. I'm thrilled with it and you will be too. :)
B007P4OTHO|5.0|It is perfect. That is all...I just learned that I need more words to complete this review. Fine.<br /><br />Perfect Perfect Perfect<br /><br />It's perfect.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|This is a great tabloid with information on a vast array of topics.  As I read it I have enjoyed New topics.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|First of all, awesome game, download now. If I had to find something, it's that the descriptions of items and their bonus properties are a little vague and you can't read the description again once you buy one . Outstanding effort, and the fact that you can actually play the game fully without spending money actually makes me more willing to spend money to enhance the game. Many &amp;#34;freemium&amp;#34; games ramp up the difficulty to a point where it becomes nearly impossible to continue without forking over cash to get an upgrade / weapon / ability that can't be had any other way. I would be willing to pay for another release by fgol knowing they produce a quality product like this that is free to play. These guys would do well on XBL or Playstation Store arcade type downloadable games. Keep up the good work. Keep working and you may hit big and have the next Angry Birds cash cow.
0920236162|5.0|I was searching for good princess books for my kid who is obsessed with princesses.  I was so happy to find this one.  It is an awesome book with a great ending.
B007XF4J70|4.0|movie content is great but it does not get 5 stars as my player has trouble playing it (but none other of my disks have any issues). The problem is with the physical medium itself.
B0009MAO46|5.0|I ordered this video for my little grandson several years ago, which he absolutely loved.  I had taken other grandchildren to see the movie when it was in the theaters and I absolutely loved it.  The grandkids picked out certain favorites from the movie and often repeated the dialogue, including one grandson who fastened a towel into a cape and leaped from the dining room table time and time again, shouting, &#34;To infinity and beyond.&#34;  He is now 21 years old and those memories are very precious.  I bought the video from Amazon for a younger grandson, who absolute loved it and needed his own copy.  I do believe he watched it repeatedly, up to several times in a day, and eventually wore it out.
0312427565|5.0|Is The Right Stuff the Great American Novel? Obviously it's not a novel, but this book follows NONE of the standards the reading public and (more powerfully) the publishers demand. The language flows like the Nile, WOOOOOOOOSSHHHHing forward and then holding still over moments that stay with the reader long after he's finished the copy.<br /><br />This is not a proper review, frankly, and shouldn't be considered one. This is a charge. You MUST read The Right Stuff. It matters not whether you find flight and aeronautics important. What matters is that you are interested in a breathtaking story.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|Fascinating insight into Jeff Bezos and Amazon. I took notes all the way through the book - oh, and Jeff Bezos actually does respond to emails (at least getting the executive team to respond).  Genius!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|With subtle changes, the plot seems to remain about the same as the first book in the trilogy.  I did like the ending which was a nice teaser for the final book in the trilogy.
0670024856|5.0|I kept trying to connect the woman who wrote Eat Pray Love with the woman who wrote this book. I absolutely loved both of them. This new one is brilliant..the characters just jump out at you and her knowledge of mosses and biology is most impressive. I think it is a stunning follow up to her very popular Eat Pray Love..
B000002I7H|5.0|This 17-track compilation offers an excellent overview of Albert King's Stax recordings of the 1960s. Curiously enough, it was Estelle Axton (the sister of Stax Records' co-founder Jim Stewart) who was instrumental in getting Albert King signed to Stax as many at the label were hesitant to sign a Blues singer and guitarist to the label fearing that record sales would not be strong. This was obviously a shrewd move as Albert King (like Little Milton) would enjoy a very successful career as a Stax recording artist and would prove to be equally popular with both Blues and R&B/Soul audiences. If you are a fan of either traditional Blues or Southern R&B you really should get this CD as it proves unequivocally that both Blues and R&B/Soul music have far more in common than most people realize and it is a throwback to an era when real, heartfelt and soulful music was at the order of the day. Albert King was recently inducted into the Rock& Roll Hall Of Fame...an honor which he truly deserves. Enjoy!
B00GRPD0J0|3.0|It's &#34;just&#34; OK. Found a mucho better one that lets me have multiple engines, incl. my favorite BING! So I'll use latter.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I read it because the movie was coming out. my high school students were reading it. Great story for young and old.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|One of the best Bond's ever! Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery! I like how it ties the backstory in.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works perfectly with my Galaxy S4 and iPad Mini to stream to my TV! Easy setup and very easy to setup! I love how small it is so I can take it whenever I go to a buddies house and whatnot. Highly reccommended!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I LOVE THIS VERSION AND WOULD GIVE IT 5 stars if not for the ads.  A lot of times trying to close an ad causes the game to crash. It is very frustrating.
0385474547|5.0|The book is  one of the best African novels on the planet. I read it in high school and can't get enough of it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So addicting!  Once you start playing Candy Crush - it is hard to stop because it is just so much fun!  As of this review - I am already on level 110.  Just a word of caution - it is easy to get caught up in buying power ups - to use within the levels or to use to advance to the next set of levels.  Don't do it!  It may take you longer to advance but you really don't NEED the power ups to win each level and you can ask friends (via Facebook) to help you advance to the next set of levels.  So far, you only need three friends to help get to the next set of levels - I have heard once you get to the higher levels (maybe 150 and up?) it increases to five - but still, don't get sucked into the power-ups - just have fun with it and you won't be able to put it down!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Amazing.  The author draws you in and makes you feel such strong emotions at every turn.  The story, the unique style of writing, the even more unique choice of narrator, everything was superb.  I can't believe this was written by someone so young, this is what you would expect of a many times over bestselling 50-60-something author.  I can't wait to read his other works, and excited for what the future holds for Mr. Zusak. What a talent.
B0041D843M|3.0|He makes a compelling argument about the causes and cures for cancer, but I'm not sure that his conclusions are that valid. He still has great evidence for a diet improvement for Americans.
B008Q0AP2E|5.0|It's a great sexy scary movie. I remember when it was being cast and thought &#34;Tom Cruise as Lestat?  No way!  But this proved to me how good an actor he is.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|The title says it all, this is just another game to waste some time. It's fun, but don't waste ant money on it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love this product. Makes my life easy. I can quickly search youtube video and send it to my tv. My kids love it too. so easy to use my 4 year old son can send his netflix movies to tv with no help. No need buy expensive smart tv or smart blu ray player.
B00AW57L96|5.0|A great story with lots of twists, keeps you turning pages right to the end. Love that it is set in Australia.
B00CHS31DG|5.0|its fun I have used it a lot and would recommend it I get a few spirits in the house I would love to learn how to make sense of the words

B000I3SYEI|5.0|Very good movie.  It is one of my favorite Star Trek  movies.  I would recommend watching the movie.  I like the ending of the movie.  Obviously setting it up for the next Star Trek movie.
B00GM9Q9U8|1.0|I found this movie to be very disappointing.  The camera work was the &#34;too close and moving&#34;  style, which I think is idiotic!  I want to SEE the action from a reasonable distance.  Also this movie was more about the daughter of the North Grandmaster than about Ip Man himself.  Donnie Yen? Where are you?
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Another of my husband's favourite shows from the past and he is delighted with it. Could of done better anywhere and the price was spectacular!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I was slow reading this book. On our trip to Disneyworld, I read 73% of this book, a real page turner.  Loved it!
B00G0KY1UO|3.0|did not care for this game but that does not mean anything some one else may like it give it try
B0058W74UY|5.0|ok
B000JQU1VS|5.0|There's nothing not to like here. I've read all these stories<br />before and enjoyed reading them again. Doyle was a gifted<br />author.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I've always loved Sci-fi but this takes it to an almost real level. You feel for the characters in this show. Weather that feeling is sadness, love or complete hatred (governor) is all on you. Don't get attached to anyone in particular or you may get disappointed.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is lots of fun but can be frustrating.  Being stuck on a level for months is no fun.
B004NOCCEG|5.0|A tale of how wealth and influence have turned a majority of the nation into cattle to be herded or butchered for table for the benefit of  a few. A reminder that to make a totem of greed is to invite corruption.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|ok
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My daughter has been playing candy crush for awhile and kept telling me to try it...well I downloaded it a month ago and haven't played anything else since! I got to level 35 and thought I had to pay to go but found that I just had to beat more challenges...Great app! Challenges are good and keeps you busy! I recommend highly
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|Have always loved the Bridget Jones series and this novel did not disappoint! Despite my mourning over Mr. Darcy, I still enjoyed the book.
B004GHNHVW|4.0|I enjoy this CD.  Of course if you enjoy Paul Simon you can not go wrong with this CD.  Great!
B00GP0G0IK|3.0|Good game, but not very intuitive. Must use hints constantly. Also, short for the $4.99 price. I have played many better (and longer) games for $2.99 or less. Good story. Nice graphics. Just not that fun to play &amp; definitely overpriced.
1878424319|5.0|The impact of being heard of this man, creates a bold, &#34; YOU CANNOT EVER MISS THE POINT!&#34; The self help of this book made me think, where should I be at in my life right now? I am me, for the sake of this book.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|ok
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Like the first book in this series, &#34;The Name of the Wind,&#34; this was a serious page turner.<br /><br />Kvothe's education continues, including during a period taken off from the University during which he learns more than the University could about life.  His relationship with Denna also matures, but at the same time feels like it may never get anywhere.  And the ongoing feud with Ambrose hits new highs for lows.<br /><br />I've got to say that I felt like shouting at Kvothe at times for his choices.  But he's young, foolish, and impulsive.  Just when I think he's matured out of it, he does something foolish again.  Don't get me wrong.  It didn't take anything away from the story.  If anything, it pulled me in more, as I was pulling for Kvothe to see the light.
B00594XOZU|5.0|A few weeks ago I say that it didn't work yesterday morning  ,it just needed a update and it worked so all you need is to update.......So just update
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What's not to love about this show?! I heard everyone talking about it for over a year...never was interested to I saw it available as a download via Amazon. So I tried it out & watched most episodes back to back! :)<br />Was very pleased with Amazon's digital download (very easy app to install & use on my ipad) and loved watching all the Downton Abbey drama unfold. Can't wait for new season to start January 2014!
0345803507|2.0|I read this book because I needed to know what the fuss was about. I wish I hadn't wasted my money!  What an awful, anti-gender-equality story.  Even worse than Twilight (which as you know is what this story is based on).
B00BAXFACO|4.0|Mickey Haller is one of my favorite characters and this books does not disappoint. In fact, this books adds depth to the character. The finale is incredible.<br />My only criticism is some of the detail is too wordy.  It could have been explained in fewer words and with more clarity.  BUT it is still a great read.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|ok
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book.  It's so funny. A great book in this series. I think this is the best one yet
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's fun, simple, and addictive. Not much else to be said I guess. This part here is just filler. Yup.
B00CHVJI08|5.0|Bought this as a reward gift for my 9 year old son's high honor roll report card. We saw this movie in the theater last year & couldn't stop laughing! Still love the movie each time we watch it. The DVD & plush toy came quickly, were in perfect condition and was exactly as described on site. Wonderful purchase! :)

B00001ZSVG|4.0|Beware!!!! There are DIFFERENT LIVE albums. This is a bluesy live recording WITHOUT the hits you may be thinking. Actually I'm happy with different copy than what I was expecting, now I just have to order other &#34;Live&#34;. Look at tracks and other reviews don't match. Caveat Emptor
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Fabulous story(ies), great acting. Who's good, who's evil? (Answer: each character's a little of both.) Download 'The Revolution Was Televised'/Alan Sepinwall to read about this and 11 other revolutionary TV series.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B008MM9630|4.0|The game is easy to play. I like that you don't have to ask people for items to continue. Easy for my nieces and nephews to play on the farm too.
006016848X|1.0|This book was not written well. It is more like an elementary guide to dating. The advice is outdated and it is not helpful with marriages.
B004H4XCG4|5.0|Jane Austen, need I say more? ( Apparently I do because ten more words seem to be a minimum requirement). That this book is still read widely and enjoyed in the 21st century and can still provoke smiles at Jane's powers of of witty observation is sufficient measure of its worth. Her characters are timeless.
B0084AVKZW|5.0|This was an amazing easy read book that not only satisfies your time, but exercises your thinking process as well.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|It's really just a dictionary. A good regular dictionary. if you need one here it is. it's a dictionary. A good regular dictionary. It's quit interesting if you need it. Like I said it is a good regular dictionary. (: good regular dictionary.
B006PTL1GC|4.0|This would be the first David Cronenberg film I had ever seen. I was brought to this film being supremely interested in Psychology and Freud. The story involves more Carl Jung and is actually the tale of how Jung came to know Freud. The acting is good and it is pretty well paced. I did enjoy Fassbender in the film as he is just really convincing as Jung, and he does stand out as a great character. At an hour and a half, the film doesn't feel long but rather feels like it's lacking a little bit. Jung's wife is introduced a couple of times but I feel that she could have been a bigger part of the film as a whole since her relationship with Jung is a motivator for some of his actions. Without a doubt this film is meant for a niche audience and if the Actors call to you then it might be worth watching. Still it really is meant for those of us with some knowledge of Psychology and an interest into how these people came to create modern psychology as we know it today.

B0009P5YXO|5.0|This was a gift for my son.  He loved it!  He loves the fact that there were three sound effects to choose from.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|i thought of giving it a try. i figured if it keep running in the backround. then i would uninstall it. so far it did not. i found good deals and it is very easy to order and check your orders fro the app.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|It is a down to earth movie about crime that actually happens. I also can be very funny too. It is one of the better movies
B00EKTCQCC|3.0|It seemed like bait and switch.  It's only a trial version which shows only the skeletal system.  This is a great program but you have to pay is you want more.  I can't complain-it was free.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I enjoy playing this app. I love how there's so many games you can play. And even more games that you can earn. Everyone should give this game a chance. Hopefully you'll enjoy it as much as I do.
B001E75QH0|5.0|The Indiana Jones series is a tribute to the cliffhanger series of the 1930's.  The hero faces impossible odds, and hopeless situations, but in the end he wins the day.  Thats what makes these films so much fun to watch, the hero not only triumphs, but he wins the fair damsel.  What more is necessary, you have none stop action, romance, dastardly villians, everything that makes a film enjoyable.  Indiana Jones has those rugged good looks, and he is a man of action, plus he's fighting for the good old USA.  Don't worry about complicated moral issues, or some deeper meaning to these films, it doesn't exist.  Simply sit back , get you;re favorite snacks and you're best friends, and just enjoy the movie.  JRV
B007N31YH0|5.0|The service was fast and uncomplicated, the price was right. A movie I loved when it came out, now I HAVE to show it to the next generation!!!
1423113462|5.0|Just. Wow. I am thirteen years old, and I read this when it came out. It blew my mind. The story actually has REAL SUBSTANCE, not just another excuse to write about teenage love and passionate kissing scenes. The characters have depth and dimension, which is saying something. Riordan generates a story mixed with laugh out loud jokes, heart-stopping TRUE love scenes (Not just cruddy covers to write about adolescents stuffing their tongues down each other's throats), and action scenes that are fast, but no too much so the reader gets lost. Rick understands friendship, family, bravery, confidence, and the personalities of each character to the detail that mix into a masterpiece. The end is jaw dropping that makes you crave the next book. The Percy Jackson Series are left in the dust; if you haven't read this, READ IT NOW AND YOU WON'T REGRET IT! Please don't miss the chance to read a real story, I beg you.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I have been trying to get away from Facebook but you have to use it in order to sea trade in this game. It's so frustrating when everything is tied into Facebook.
B003B02O3C|5.0|Among Grisham's best I think. Great characters (with the exception of love interest who I found seriously in need of therapy)...Gresham teaches while he entertains..like use of first person in this book particularly...

B00BAXFECK|5.0|Superb! Vivid characters, fascinating plot - so much to ponder! Truly could not put it down but hated for it to end. I highly recommend it. Well worth the investment of time.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Kept my attention, I was very spellbound. Enjoyed this Crossfire novel. Loved the hot romance between Gideon and Eva. Would total recommend.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This, Temple Run, and Subway Surfers are the most fun and addicting games:) I love them, especially this one! Just because, the Minions made it more awesome! :D
B00992CF6W|3.0|It is kinda like minecraft but it doesn't have redstone. It would also be better if there were pets like dogs like the pc and xbox.

1476727651|5.0|Great Book!  I couldn't ask for a better sequel to the Shining!  I enjoyed it immensely.  I started on a Saturday morning and ended that evening, late.  I haven't read a King novel like that in years!  WTG!!!  A homerun in my humble opinion!!!
B002VPE1WK|4.0|It is really a good bag for the price !!<br />If you are buying it for your first DSLR then it is the best buy !!<br />After couple of months, I started feeling that I should have made a different choice due to the construction quality of this bag. They are really good & nicely partitioned. But the external walls are not strong or waterproofed. Space is also little bit less.<br /><br />Again, this bag is best for its price & amazon rocks :)
B008JGSM6G|1.0|I couldn't find any way to cancel this as it was a mistaken order as I don't play games at all.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This book is what young love is always about. You have to love that person in a way no one else can. You have to look past all that is wrong about them to find that what you see is amazing and lovable. These characters had a lot of hurdles to go through to fine each other. It wasn't the type of book were everything happened all at once but gradual. I could not put this book down and had me sucked in from the first page.
B001I082QU|5.0|Although now a perennial holiday favorite, in first run \\"Wonderful Life\\" failed to earn back its $3.7 million cost.<br /><br />Shortly after its release, the FBI cited this movie's anti-banker plotline as a common ploy used by Communists. There may be some truth here, for the story was partly scripted by Dalton Trumbo, playwright Clifford Odets and poet/critic Dorothy Parker. All three were investigated for possible Communist activities. Trumbo and Parker were both blacklisted. Odets avoided the same fate by cooperatively naming his \\"fellow travelers.\\"<br /><br />SYNOPSIS--<br />After a large sum of his customers' money is inadvertantly lost, businessman George Bailey (Stewart) attempts suicide by jumping off a bridge into an icy river. He's rescued by an angel named Clarence (Travers).

0743455967|5.0|I'm not a Stephen King fan, but this book really deserves a 5 star rating. As a writer, I find it very interesting and motivational.
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|Galactic Energies has something for everyone Sci-Fi, Erotica, Cyberpunk, Fantasy, and Paranormal. If you enjoy any of those genres then you'll love this collection of short stories. The cover is so gorgeous, and I'm vein, so I was easily sold by that alone. However, the stories were so engrossing. I read them in one sitting.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Uber fast performance fastest processor I've ever owned rapes cpu intensive games and can stretch its legs with My Gigabyte R9 270x I recommend BOTH!!
051756338X|5.0|This is the second time I have read Sarum--having first read it when it was published.  The author provides an amazing opportunity to reflect on the \\"six degrees of separation\\" theory.  Ultimately, maybe we ARE all related! I ordered a hardback copy of Sarum to go with the other copies of Rutherfurd's books in my collection.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|I keep all my music on Amazon Cloud.  I use this app to listen to my stuff on my phone.  This latest update, 3.0.2 is the reason I gave it 2 stars.  When you're listening to an album, you used to be able to add another to the \\"now playing\\" list.  This is no longer an option.  Also, the reaction time when you do something, (Skip a track...play a different album...scan forward in a track...) is significantly delayed.<br /><br />Time for a version rollback :)  I wish.<br /><br />Another \\"feature\\" I just discovered:  When you add an entire album(s) to a playlist, the stupid application plays the tracks in a random order.  (I don't really know if it's random, I didn't qa test for randomness)  This is mildly annoying for music, pull your hair out annoying for audiobooks.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Such a fun game!  I'm addicted- keeps me  entertained for hours.Downloaded it for my daughter and I can't put it down lol
B000DN5W4I|5.0|joe at his best in the old days, small clubs. before you had to get tickets 9 months in advance to see him
B009ZQJ1G4|1.0|You have to wonder how this film got released.  Someone thinks we are really really stupid.  Lets steal the exact plot and look from some good movie and see if people will buy it.  We don't.....
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Watch it faithfully every Christmas along with &#34;A Charlie Brown Christmas&#34; and &#34;A Christmas Story&#34;. Pure magic for the child that lives in all of us.
0316044695|5.0|This book is incredible and I can't believe its a true story. The detail is incredible and you can really feel like you're in Marcus's place,  However it is VERY sad so keep that in mind. Half of the book is taken up by the training he went through, you can easily skip this part, but it's still a major part of the book. I really loved this book and can't wait to see the movie. This is a pretty thick book with a lot of plot points. I have read it multiple time's and its always a pleasure reading it again.
B006PIXKVW|2.0|&#34;A Little Princess&#34; is a classic children's story.  Unfortunately, this particular film adaptation played too fast and loose with the story line, leaving it closer to the Shirley Temple movie than to the original novel.  On the positive side, Liesl Matthews is wonderful in the role.
B000Q7ZO8U|4.0|Took off a star for the creepiness of the hobo at times, especially in the abandoned toys car scene. We have to skip that scene every time.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Gives you access to all the areas of Facebook to check on how all your friends are doing and to read their posts.
B00004T9VY|5.0|There is not one song on this album that I do not love. It is timeless, it is beautiful in its simplicity, and an added plus if you're a &#34;Harold and Maude&#34; fan, which used it for the sound track.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This was my favorite of the series. Completely different from the first book. It is written as a stand alone book,but I think the book has more depth if you read ender's game first. The more books you read the more difficult it is to find something unique and novel, which is what I found in this book.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I loved this book and read it quickly because the horror of the background story in this book was so lyrically told. I thought I was going to read it quickly because the movie was just being released but it was otherwise. I don't want to spoiling for anyone - read this creatively told tale!  Saukerl...
B0091VTISO|1.0|How come so many people can write so much about such a piece of crap!!!! ...This film deserves to had been made by &#34;Asylum&#34; ....they specialize on things deeper than &#34;sheet&#34;. ;)
B00571F26Y|4.0|My husband bought this book as his doctor advised him to eat smarter, something I've asked for years.  From reading this book he has modified his eating habits and lost his &#34;wheat belly&#34;.  While he stated the author gets a bit technical, it must have created a sense of informational truth that is understandable and acceptable.  Feeling better he has also exercised more, both contributing to the weight loss and lowering his blood sugar.
B000002O5L|5.0|If you're a Tom Petty fan, this is, in my estimation, his best album by far. It contains some of his best classics.
B00FPH51LQ|5.0|omg this is the best we and i totally love it! you really need to see about getting one. (~:
B007SGM084|5.0|It was fun to read. I could not put it down.  I will read again.  There needs to be more this this LOL!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Use it for grocery list, home projects, recipes and checklist. Very user friendly.  I have this installed in my iPhone, iPad, pc, and kindle.
B00GTZJLAK|2.0|The production quality seemed Plastic not as fluid as Cars. Very disappointed in the movie, it did not have the Hollywood production value.  Don't expect what you saw in cars..
B000ZN802W|5.0|Emile Hirsch did a wonderful job portraying Chris McCandless's journey and it was incredibly well done considering that we really don't know much about what that journey entailed. We know some, but as for the rest, it does a really good job guessing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it's just a lot of fun, although I get frustrated, when I can't figure out what I am supposed to do ti win..it changes all the time!
B00BLGDFH2|3.0|I'm a fan of Dave Grohl, and although I don't always prefer the music he chooses to play, I fully appreciate his commitment and enthusiasm for the art.  I ordered the soundtrack because I was enthralled by the movie.  There are some standout tracks on this (Paul McCartney's was a hoot), but there are some weird ones, too, that I just couldn't get with.  But, as far as a tribute to a great recording studio from &#34;back in the day&#34; it's a wonderful compilation of talent and creativity. I ended up with 2 tracks from the album on my MP3 player.  I worked as a session musician at Sound City back in the 70s, and it was a hoppin' place to be sure.
0060775858|5.0|Following family tradition. Bought for my children, grandchildren and now my great granddaughter.<br />Always a good read for young children.
0307591549|5.0|I think this book has a great and important message and it helped me change my mindset to a more positive and constructive way.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|This is a relatively little known film that you should see. It is understated and rich; Marianne Sagebrecht gives a great performance as does Jack Palance and all their co-stars. A truly wonderful story well constructed.
B00CHVJI08|4.0|The toy was a bit crappy, but still a great movie. Our children were mesmerized by the colors and we enjoyed the story.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I love it! faantastiiiiic absolutely positively amazing! I recommend it for everyone who ever saw the movie and those who didn't!
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Amazon has shows and movies for everyone...came fast great price and it was a hit...this is a great site to by any TV show....or movie.  They are the best at having the newest show out first and fast!
0307887898|4.0|I liked a lot of the practical ideas and advices. It helped me get an overview and thus make better decisions.

B0044XRIMW|3.0|The movie is a classic, of course. At first,  the quality of the video seemed poorer than I expected but later I think the streaming was corrected.
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|Easy to master the controls, my eight year old daughter picked it up in just a few minutes.  Addicting but also challenging.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I love this show...but missed the early seasons...so glad Amazon has this...can't wait to watch season one!  Good price and comes quickly!
B00AKKS278|4.0|Simple clear and one of the best ideas ever, even if it is not the most original. This book helped me focus on building myself in the morning, which makes a lot more sense than spread out through the day. It sets you off for the perfect day, when the most important thing is already done and it is a successful day from the start.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I believe every Italian (and man) should own this series.  The only one I don't care for is Rocky V...I could do without this one, but the rest are gold.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I really love this game. I never thought it would be so realistic to be a tablet game.<br />DEFIANTLY A GOOD DEAL
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I gave this CD to one of my son's girlfriend and this year I'm giving it to another son's girlfriend.  I love this movie and I want to share it with them!
1449410243|5.0|Silly book for cat lovers...came fast and was a great joke gift for my cat loving friends.  It's all in fun!
B00GOZQ2E8|5.0|This game seems to be a nice mix of building a town and growing crops and sending adventurers on adventures.
B006GKHE6G|5.0|Great game with beautiful graphics. The audio and controls are both beautifully dive as well. The interface is very clear and the intro notes are sharp and crisp.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This is so good cuz u txt ur friend even if u don't have their #. I really enjoy this app.
B004EPZ08O|4.0|Oy Vey - So how many FD's can there be? FIVE!!!!!!!! LOL! I mean its a FINAL destination - normally signifying the END of an destination. It wasn't that bad of a film, seeing how they tied it into something - will not give any spoilers on that but it wasn't too bad.
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|Such a fun movie...loved the price I got at amazon...and never had to step outside...gift for my birdwatching parents...they will love it!
0394818237|4.0|Not as great as the original-- something like 40% has been removed.  But still great, and one of the best books you can have on the shelf for your kids.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|A must watch for me every year!  A Christmas Classic which is fun for the whole family.  Who doesn't love the Griswolds?!?! :-)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great can't stop playing need to be able to get lives faster would like to see more timed levels but I love playing
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Again LOVE this adaptation - Ruth Wilson became Jane for me on this one. Again a very attractive fella is playing Mr.Rochester but conveys the brute and Byronic nature of the character - Mr. Toby Stephens (who is in Anne Bronte's Tenant Of Wildfell Hall!) Love PBS for airing this!
0345803507|5.0|I cannot begin to describe my experience reading this book.  I have read all books, and am continued to be intrigued by the characters and their experiences.
B0059GVB5I|4.0|Fun, edgy noirish drama.  Don't bother with the Blu-ray though, it's not appreciably different from standard DVD except in price.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I've been reading Stephen King's books from Day1, and this ranks among his best.  His characters have become like old friends, and I was happy to see what a strong man Danny has become.  Thank you, Stephen, for continuously providing me with books that capture my attention and mind.  Years after finishing a book, I'm still thinking about the people I've met and wondering what the years have brought to them.
B008JDAC7G|2.0|Ok first of all coming from a ten year old girl who is a easy pleaser this game is so addicting and fun on another note this game is so stupid because of the price and it gives away your privacy I hate it do not download it SUCKS
B001DDBCUU|5.0|Oh these ladies of the big city - the film was great. I enjoyed it; actually went to the movies to see it when it 1st came out in 2008 with my sister. She covered my eyes briefly for the VIEW - Folks there is a quick frontal male shot. Back shot too - Whoo...Haha!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I also really enjoyed reading this book. Being I mostly read books that are based on a true event it really intrude me. It takes you behind the scene as to what a really good sniper goes through.
0694003611|5.0|I wanted to start a library for my new grandson so this book had to be a part of it.
B00CL50LEC|4.0|It was totally enjoyable and entertaining....exactly what I was looking for.  It won't be nominated for any awards, but I'm a sucker for romantic comedies and this one didn't disappoint.
0446310786|5.0|This is a classic book for a great price. Arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I ordered for a class I am teaching and this was the best price I could find online.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|Loved the show long before I was old enough to really watch it and understand how four white ladies could be such big ole floozies! I mean seriously - I am all about liberation but DAMN! Content of the shows events aside the banter and comical situations where enough to sell me. The sequel took place exactly 2 years after the 1st film - expensive clothes and trips. Nonetheless visually appealing with shhhh I cannot afford. LOL! Its an alright film - IF they want to do a 3rd one better hurry the heck on up - they are aging like mad!
B00G6MW68K|5.0|great quality blu ray! can't get a better quality blu ray and cd combo than this. great band plus great quality cd.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|Really like this movie and answered some questions about the very first movie Alien. Actually wish it had more content, lasted longer...great special effects and interesting characters.
B006O5YHUY|5.0|This movie is pretty awesome. I have watched it a number of times on the premium channels and decided I could watch it even more. A very compelling story about the disfunctions of a split family. And all based around a young and upcoming sport.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|This is a terrific book in many ways.  It has a great plot line, the characters are well delineated, and the background story of the antique business is fascinating.  I didn't give it five stars because it's a bit too long and drawn out.  I was drawn to reading it to find out what happened next, which means I really did like it, but my only complaint is that it was overdone in several places.<br />A definite recommendation, though.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Bronte Sisters work - so many adaptations to Charlotte's Jane Eyre (I am quite partial to Anne Bronte's 'Agnes Grey' its a fantastic book) I am in love with Michael Fassbender - he is too goregous to play Mr.Edward Fairfax Rochester but nonetheless wonderful as is the lovely Mia Wasikowska as the title character.
B006RTFP9E|5.0|perfect for a five year old he plays with it constantly, needs help to put it together but well worth the effort
B00G70JQZC|5.0|The best portrayal of Wolverine to date! It susperseeds the badly written last two x-men movies (X-men: The Last Stand and Wolverine: Origins)
B009E3EYS8|5.0|This is fabulous; I'm 62 and if you are \\"one of us\\" you will be stunned by this.  How could these old guys pull this off??  Answer-really really well.  I love sitting friends down in front of home theater with Kashmir and making them sit thru to the end.  While watching it first thought-this isn't going to work...6 minutes later its an out loud respectful \\"WOW.\\"  All you \\"need\\" in my humble opinion is the dvd and the cds-for $24 the bargin of the year.  And I repeat-stunning.  One of the few concert DVD's my wife has actually sat and enjoyed.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I was impressed with the ease with which I was able to install, setup and use.<br /><br />My purpose was to make my desktop PC software available to me while I was out of town. Though a bit cumbersome to use on my Nexus, it was doable and was much easier than hauling a computer with me!<br /><br />My next use is going to help my son (who lives half a world away from me) learn bookkeeping. I'm confident this will be the best way to go.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is the best  I love it a pool much  I love this game and I love the animals too
B007SGLZH6|5.0|Clearly written, detailed and scientific.  Recipes are written so you can schedule fermentation around your work schedule.  Purchasing a kitchen scale is a must.  Plus if you like neapolitan style, there are some great recipes in here.
B00EKR61FM|1.0|I was waiting for this article but I'm disappointed as it doesn't have an iTunes compatible digital copy, just the UV copy.
B000003CMB|4.0|great blusey album to put on on a long drive or just kickin back at your home when you feel nice and relaxed!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I really appreciate the simplicity of the interface and large buttons making it easy for my old eyes and arthritic fingers. A few advanced math functions would be a nice addition making it perfect.
B00EL8I8IS|1.0|DONT GET IT SINCE IT DOES NOT ALSO HAVE THE UNRATED VERSION LIKE THE NORMAL DVDS THEY SELL AT STORES.
B007BVT5N4|5.0|Great book! I love it so much! Awesome novel written by a famous talented boy who grew up with the whole world watching.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is the best bingo and slots game out there. Easy to understand, daily credits and you can connect with your facebook friends. The only thing I would change is the limit on gifts you can accept, that makes it really frustrating. Other than that I love this game.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|I just started, and already it's the best racing game available. Graphics are amazing and the game play is great.
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|I love the challenge of the game but wish it had the option to turn off the timer/scoring. I'm not interested in competing, only in the fun of the game and it's challenge. The timer/scoring is a detriment for me and it actually slows me down.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|It's really an enjoyable game that my grandchildren play every time they visit me.<br />I would love for more Disney games on the Kindle.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I need a quick calculator and one that tracks my actions is great.  My work in warehouse finds many uses with this app.<br />Love love love the BIG buttons with the kindle versatility I can use it everywhere like shopping too!<br />I have tried several other calculator apps but this is the one I am keeping.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so awesome everyone should get it and plus on the 8 of December<br />The next update comes out .8.0
B003TZ9EGO|4.0|The track on the US version are ok I really prefer the imported version of this album it's a little more but still worth it.
B00A6CCF0K|1.0|I'm not sure if it happens to all authors but it seems at one point they peak and they can never come back. Your last couple of books are non sequitur and uninteresting and weird and basically just bad. I always tell people that Stephen King is not a horror writer he writes about being age 11 in 1957 with an amazing memory to go back to those days. I think you were about age 11 in 1957. You've written some amazing imagination literature but this and the previous book and even the dome are very weak it's like you're trying too hard it's like you think you have to move to another stage please just go back to where you were.
B00BC254I8|5.0|Reading Mike Tyson's story is confirmation he is human like everyone else· I continue to root for her personal & professional success·
B0000A0DRY|5.0|Classic, nothing more need be said. Great that the CD contains some bonus tracks not found elsewhere, 1 has become my fav Airplane tune.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I have read every book in this series and I have watched all of the series on HBO.  I love these books and films.  Martin twists and turns with every page.
B00E9ZAT4Y|3.0|I received my blu ray yesterday. Sound is amazing but picture is very grainy. I have a new HD projector so it shows up every single flaw. Although the picture is much clearer than the DVD the film stock shows it's age. Still a great picture and Julie Andrews a movie star in the making!
B0018D4SHY|5.0|Fast delivery, clear sound and great quality!  A classic with a lot of appeal.  Totally worth it.  The Best of Little Richard.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|love it I have not 10.1 2014 and BB 9900, it can chanrage both with no problem, what i like also is the bult in cable, you will not forget it, ready to go big plus for someone forgotable like me
B008Y5T5ZE|3.0|It was a good movie, however it was not what I was expecting after reading the synopsis.  It was a little too odd for me.
0345803485|2.0|I'm really not a book snob. I can usually find something in any genre of books that I would consider worth reading and my book selections tend to be quite eclectic. There are two genres of fiction that I generally steer clear of and admittedly would be embarrassed to be caught perusing the shelves in those sections of a bookstore, fantasy and romance.<br /><br />E.L. James' romance/erotica novel, Fifty Shades of Grey was definitely not on my TBR list. It landed in my hands for two reasons.<br /><br />First, it's a huge pop-culture phenomenon. I started feeling left out. It's a bit like Twilight or Harry Potter, you need to read it to be &#34;in the know&#34;.<br /><br />Second, my aunt gave me her copy. A friend convinced her to buy it and she couldn't get beyond the first couple of chapters. It's like when you eat something that you don't like and want someone else to share in your misery. &#34;I hated it. Here, try it&#34;. Thanks.<br /><br />So I did. I contemplated skipping writing a review, so that I wouldn't have to admit to having read Fifty Shades of Grey. Instead, I'm swallowing my pride (theming intended) and confessing to having read it.<br /><br />The novel is told from the perspective of recent college graduate, Anastasia Steele, who in her final weeks of college is sent to interview an insanely rich buisness man, Christian Grey, for her college newspaper. In addition to being rich and attractive, Christian also has a mysterious dark side. He seduces Anastasia, who happens to be a virgin and offers her a position as his sexual submissive. Anastasia is both horrified and intrigued. The story unfolds as a power-play between the two characters as they negotiate both their needs and emotions.<br /><br />I kind of don't know what to make of this story. It wasn't 100% horrible. Honestly, a fair bit of it was entertaining. It was not in the slightest bit sexy or erotic. This is probably just me, but I felt like the sex parts bogged down the pacing of the story. They were so graphic that they left nothing to the imagination. It was dull to read as it didn't engage my  imagination. Unfortunately, this was also a large chunk of the story. I have no idea how this is going to translate into a compelling movie.<br /><br />I had a difficult time connecting with either main character. However, I did like the parts of the story that were told through an e-mail exchange. Anastasia and Christian spend a fair bit of the story exchanging flirty and sometimes angry emails that felt genuine. James did a great job at capturing that rush of excitement and toe-stepping that happens when you first begin a relationship. There are many great little moments in the email exchange.<br /><br />There was one phrase that Anastasia uses repeatedly, seemingly on every page, that drove me nuts. Inner Goddess. What the hell does that even mean? It just sounded silly every time I read it. Her character is someone who is obsessed with classic novels and has unrealistic romantic expectations, so in some ways it fits. It still sounded ridiculous.<br /><br />I knew nothing about the author before reading the book, but within the first couple of chapters, I knew that she was British. She uses phrasing that Americans don't use. I probably wouldn't have caught this, if I hadn't recently married a Brit. In fact, I wouldn't have picked up on it at all, as it was slight. I'm not knocking her writing, it just was something funny that I noticed.<br /><br />The ending was very unsatisfying. It doesn't really even set you up for the next book. It just ends and it's depressing. I definitely don't feel compelled to find out what happens next.<br /><br />I enjoyed the kitschiness of the dialogue.  James often reminded me of author Jacqueline Susann. The story rarely takes itself too seriously, which is why it works. Personally, I enjoyed reading about Christian's house/plane/helicopter. I wanted to read in detail about the clothes that he bought for Ana. Forget the erotic parts, I wanted to hear about the fabulous dates!<br /><br />In the end, I'm glad that I read it and now know what the fuss is all about. I'm highly unlikely to read the other books or see the movie version, but I don't feel like reading Fifty Shades of Grey was a waste. It's decent escapist literature and if James decided to branch out into something less genre specific, I would read her.<br /><br />Like my review? Check out my blog!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you Amazon for finally offering Candy Crush Saga for the Fire!  Now I can stop borrowing my husband's IPAD!  Love this game-beware, it is addictive!!!
B008CPZNL6|1.0|Struggled with this for far too long. Finally gave up and uninstalled. Not what we were hoping for.look elsewhere. SORRY.
B005COO1X6|5.0|I seldom ever have an issue with the kooky, creepy Mr. King. This was interesting and different, and I wanted more, so, nice job!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you grew up in the 80s and had more than a passing interest in video games, you'll love this book.
B00000J048|5.0|Bought this for the grandchildren for Christmas. When we were little, we had one that wasn't nearly as fancy, but it still makes young minds THINK!<br />When I was in High School, it was mandatory to take an Air Force test prior to graduation. One section was all about gears, and thinking about which way each one would be turning. I aced the Air Force test......especially the mechanical part.....not too shabby for a *gurl* LOL! I want my grandchildren to do more creative, critical thinking. This is such a fun way to encourage it.<br />I have given these to others in the past, and the funny thing is, even grownups have a blast with them! They definitely encourage *quality* time.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|I love this book!  I love the whole series!  It is completely amazing.  I would recommend it to Middle Schoolers. The Giver is a great book for 6th graders because it is an easy read, yet still very enjoyable.
B00CH3DBNQ|3.0|Interesting, informative, but not well written. Definitely the testimony of a courageous girl. I bought it to further her cause.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Denzel Washington is a genuine character and the supporting cast made the movie even more plausible.  Storyline while out there was believable.  The cinematography was great.
B00947N6D8|4.0|This animated film from Dreamworks is a fantastic watch for the whole family.  Jack Frost is an outcast who has wandered for 300 years trying to find who he is.  As the Boogeyman, Pitch Black, tries to steal power away from the Guardians, Jack is called on to assist them and find his center along the way.  With fun characters and plenty of great moments in the film, Rise of the Guardians is a true joy to watch.  Caution, it may have moments that are too dark for very small children.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Not too bad of a game. I love these city and army building games and this one's story is interesting
B008JFUQ3O|1.0|I'm so disappointed about this release because of the UltraViolet doesn't offer you a true digital copy. This rating is for the format of this movie, and not the movie itself.
B0081SRJSY|1.0|poor program, caused issues crashed my phone. was not impressed, notb much else to say, but bad results with it
B008RA3X5E|3.0|Clock is ok, display is great, but i find it really irritating to set the alarm  Even after reading the instructions, it was not clear how to set the alarm.  I finally have alarm 1 set for 5 days for work, but would like occasionally set the second alarm for a weekend day, but the only choice is for 2 days.  And then I have not been able to figure out how to delete the second alarm setting.<br />Otherwise, the alarm works fine and the sound is really good.  Lots of brightness levels to choose from, so that's a plus.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|Do not like how the reload tab is near the fire tab. Too many times I have pushed it and reloaded instead of taking the shot.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|This thing has saved me a number of times already. After a couple months of heavy use it is still holding a full charge and providing me with days of extended use for my phone.<br /><br />Definitely satisfied with this one.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|I like action movies and this one has lots of it.  I hope season 4 comes out soon.  Can't wait.
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|very well put together, puts all the ideas of how things are for everyone into one movie. very good acting by all
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|I can see her receiving rewards this year no doubt with a very original song. The whole album is great!!! I meant awards,,!
0142501123|5.0|I bought this book because my son really likes &#34;The Gruffalo.&#34;  This one didn't disappoint.  It has a catchy rhyme scheme, nice pictures, and makes witches seem not so scary.  My two year old liked it so much that I sent a copy to his cousin as a gift.
B00C6BA4SE|5.0|This case is cool. For the longest time the steelebooks were only avaliable in other countries so I could never buy them for a decent price. I was excited when they announced it would be released in America. I really like it. Some people have a problem with the comic book like design but I don't. I love the design. Highly recommend to any collector.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I had high hopes for the book, but the farther I read into it, it felt like Grisham was reusing an outline from the Firm, and not very effectively. The narrator was not sympathetic, just pathetic.Save your money.
0385743564|5.0|Steelheart continues Brandon Sanderson's very creative approach to writing fantasy/science-fiction set in uniquely designed worlds.  Steelheart is more of a classic science-fiction than his more fantasy-styled Mistborn series, and the basic plot background (a small group of idealistic &#34;normal&#34; fighters in a world being socially wrecked by hundreds of nasty folks who've somehow been granted a dazzling array of odd &#34;super powers&#34;???) originally sounded to me like a loser -- but I was VERY pleasantly surprised to find a beautifully written novel that actually fits the description of &#34;hard to put down.&#34;  His writing style is gripping, his characters are personable and very real, and he creates a story that keeps you moving from beginning to end.<br /><br />I'm quite surprised to see that there are several 2-star reviewers who felt differently about the book.  Yes, at first I felt some problems with a &#34;suspension of disbelief&#34; at the basic plotline, and Sanderson has not yet gotten into the deeper background to the story (although quite satisfying as a novel within itself, it's clear he's going to be expanding upon it and exploring the background of how this disastrous world came about in future volumes), but I think Steelheart serves as a wonderful introduction to what will be a trilogy (or larger) at least as well-done as his Mistborn series!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Truly wonderful book.  Easy read but constantly exciting.  Lovable characters that you feel like you know personally. Loved every chapter.
B00G3Q6VPS|5.0|I'm a huge Britney fan... have been since 1998. Every album that comes out has a different sound. This album is no different. The sound is up to date and fresh and you actually hear more of her real vocals. I recommend the deluxe edition because the extra songs are some of the best on the album. Britney definitely did it again!
B008Y212PI|3.0|Pretty addicting game, although I am not pleased I have to write a review to unlock the last board of an app I paid for.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I wish I could check more than five stars for this book. It's one of the funniest books I've ever read. I particularly recommend this for dog lovers.
0316044695|5.0|Most incredible book that I have ever read Everyone should read this!  People have no idea what our military personnel do and what they risk for our freedom !
B00GIXY4M8|3.0|I wasn't impressed with the thought that went into this plot, it's the basic downtrodden man meets girl and becomes her white knight scenario with a lot of CGI thrown in. By the way; What's up with the train scene? Did the producer get mesmerized here? This sequence could/should? have been half as long and been fine, but Noooooooooooooo lets make it like a 1/3 of the movie.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Good game. Gets frustrating when I get stuck on a level but still a great challenge. Still fun when I need to kill time.
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|This is one of the Craziest  movie I've ever seen.  Some of the material was  a little shocking at least to me.  Very action packed.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I will be reading this book for the third time starting today. Not fond of the ending, but I am hard to please when it comes to ending a book series.
B00C8S9VKM|4.0|Very interesting period in recent American History which Bryson tells in very engaging fashion, often finding a little known and very interesting ironic twist to stories I thought I knew.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Great story and well thought out. It has been a while since a book made me stay up late to read.
B0059QJ6HI|4.0|This was a very tender story about PTSD and war and I thought was very well done.  The characters were well developed and believable.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome fun and challenging. A lot of fun and new challenges throughout. Really enjoy playing this game. Fun fun fun
B006MW3V6U|5.0|lush and beautiful.  well acted, well written... there's a reason why this show is so popular.  I wish there were more of this kind of understated programming on television, but it's probably a good thing that there isn't.  as it is now, only the very best ends up being made, which downton abbey doubtlessly is.  if you're not already watching it, you've got a real treat available to you.
B00005JLR8|4.0|A very emotional but eventually uplifting tale of loss and grief, relationship challenges, personal discovery and - ultimately - recovery and triumph as a family starts life over in a new country, under the most adverse and colorful conditions.  Landing in America, in New York City's &#34;Hell's Kitchen&#34;, an Irish family grieving the loss of a child starts over in a halfway house filled with active and recovering addicts, a dying man with AIDS whom they befriend slowly but fully, finding their way through the seedy underbelly of the city's more notorious neighborhoods.  As they make their journey their lives are forever changed; for the better.  The two girls give powerful performances that left me very impressed.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Not my usual kind of movie.  I almost bailed out in the beginning but I'm glad I stuck with it.  It did draw me in finally and I enjoyed the story.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent book.  I couldn't put it down even though at times I wanted to because I didn't want to read what was going to happen next.  Great movie as well.  Katniss is  great heroine.
B00C8985DU|5.0|Because it has everything you would expect in a Deluxe Edition and most of all, I am a diehard Beatles fan.
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|Helpful and no-nonsense.  A little technical in parts...so you read it again.<br />It makes it clear that you have to cut out the carbs and the sugar.
B00BEK6Z7M|2.0|This is the most unimaginative book I've read from Preston and Child. There is nothing to catch your attention. I was never a fan of Connie and believe that she is weak as a lead character. Pendergast seems to be aging and is far less interesting in this book. The story line is weak and they actually try to have you believe that there is a within the story so frightening that it could scare the likes of some of the greatest literary minds of all time - hardly. Everything conveniently ties together and reduces the scarce believability of the book. Fans of the authors will still read it, but I doubt many will be impressed.
B001FBIPF0|5.0|Fall Out Boy.  My daughter loves them and loved this CD.  I think they are pretty good too as she plays the music all the time!
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Fabulous game. Well made for a tablet. So much variety. And cool heroes<br />And other cool stuff. Buy this game and the second one tooE
0394800389|1.0|Book arrived in very bad shape, missing part of binding and very used. Condition was not listed accurately. Good thing pages were all there, or I would be returning. Very disappointed as it won't last long.
B0029VT3UQ|4.0|This is a great movie.  It makes one think about the impact of illiteracy on one's life.  Kate Winslow is magnificent in this movie . The range of emotions is broad  as the story develops and she does not disappont.
B000FCK65W|4.0|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a very difficult book to read.  IT is so sad to read about such a poor family whose father drinks up most of their earnings.  It is set back in the 40's as I remember.  My friend recommended the movie which I saw first.  It helped with the book.  It broke my heart to have such a meager life for a family.  It's ends on a much happier note.  I will never forget it, as it makes me count my blessings and realize that compared to that family most of us are weathly.  There is a tree that grows outside their house, hense the name.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is actually my second Chromecast because the first one I received would not stay connected.  This one however works like a charm and is a great way to get rid of the cable mess.
B00FR0GT9Y|4.0|I really liked the release.  ALOT.  And I've been along for this ride since 1976.  But this is not Boston in a bottle that will sound exactly like the early 2 Epic releases.  Just like Third Stage (my favorite Boston album) Boston has evolved with new members and maturity in the lyrics and sonic layering of this release.  There's so much to enjoy, WAY more so than 2002's Corporate America, which was an uneven and poorly promoted Boston album.  The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the revamping of 3 songs from Corporate America to release here, so it's a bit less actual NEW material.  Granted they're revamped Brad Delp tracks, and two of the 3 get nicer mixes here.  It's 4 songs if you have the exclusive \\"ti quero mia\\" track, which is \\"I had a good time\\" from CA in thin disguise.  The original version of it was far better.  If you don't have CA, with Life Love & Hope you can feel confident you didn't miss much.  Many don't like Tommy DeCarlo as a new vocalist, but I DO.  Nobody is Brad Delp and his voice can never be completely replaced.  But \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" is my favorite track on LL&H, a hauntingly beautiful song that hit me where I live.  Yeah, the groovy \\"it's easy\\" sounds have been replaced by more adult themes about loves lost and hope still possible in life. \\"Love Got Away\\" is a perfect example of this, and one of the best soaring sonic experiences on any Boston album, especially if you enjoy the organ parts! If you want old Boston, dust off the old recordings and play them.  If you want to embrace the progression of lyrical themes that showed their ever growing maturity in Third Stage and Walk On, by all means buy this with confidence you'll be satisfied.  If this is the LAST studio album from Boston, and it may well be, they're still going out on a high note.  Worth the wait, worth repeated listening and worth the few dollars you'll spend.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|I love Doctor Who!  There were so many twists & turns in season 6 that I just wanted to keep watching!
0345803485|5.0|Amazing and entertaining all the way, you wish there is nothing else to do but read<br />Looking forward to finish the second
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This thing is an animal and takes any kind of abuse you can throw at it.  If you want a knife that you don't have to worry about taking a beating but will still keep doing its job, this is it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works well and does a lot for only $35. This device is easy to set up and functions well, you get a lot of very cool functionality and features for a reasonable price.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Easy to setup - ALMOST. During synch process I got an error message. It re- synced and the error message reappeared. Apparently my Netgear R6300 needs to be modified to work with Chromecast (along with a slew of other routers). When I went to my router I could not figure out how to modify it at all. Net gear c/s was non-existent so Chromecast now only acts as a wallpaper for my 55 inch TV. I will buy Apple TV as I know it will work. Waste of time & money.<br /><br />Bernie Ness<br />Toledo, OH
B00G70K1HY|5.0|Great movie with additional action scenes guaranteed to entertain people unfamiliar with the wolverine.  I give this movie an A+ rating
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Second one I have bought, easy to set up and allows me to stream darn near anything to the big screen. I have Roku devices but they are very limited in function.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|This is a great movie. I think its one for the whole family and not just for the kids. Its a keeper.
B00GLQQ07E|4.0|I really enjoyed the second disk that has the composers speaking about the songs that were not used in the movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun to play. Makes you do alot of thinking. Good for the brain.  Hope to keep playing this game for a long time.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I love this game. Even though i had to reset my kindle to do it. I still got the game. Been waiting so long for this game and I'm so happy it's out for Amazon.
1439153663|5.0|loved!  I could not put this book down.  The book was for a book club and I have passed it along to so many friend whom all loved it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great app especially for children. it keeps them very entertained with loads of obsticales. Id reccomend this game over a lot of the other games such as temple run etc. It relates a lot to the movie with a variety of different scenes such as,  a mall, a beach,  Gru 's lab,  and El Macho 's Lair. I would get this app if you are into bananas and or the little yellow minions you know and love from the Despicable Me movie.
B00EFFVZIM|5.0|Just what I wanted as a gift. The product was what I wanted and I recieved it in a timely manager.
1575666286|5.0|Absolutely brilliant! I think this book is powerful and when you apply the principles in it to oneself it can change your life for the better or even save it!<br />Highly recommended for those of you seeking answers to chronic ill-health and are prepared to 'go into bat' for yourself.
B00C74SHRK|3.0|The sriting is good, the storyline is good but I really battled to keep interested. Also I find the continuous drug use and vomiting a bit nauseating.
0061537969|5.0|Hello. I am also 12, but I read many books and i ADORE animals. I absolutely loved this book. Garth Stein has a style of writing that is so unique and realistic. I know that this book is about a dog telling a story, but even for those of you who do not care for animals will find out that this is an exceptional book. Enzo is the sweetest thing in the world, and he will put animals in a perspective that you have never seen then in before. For me personally, this book made me cry and it is one of my favorite books that I have ever read. It is a very bittersweet book. If you like books like The Fault in our Stars and Moon Over Manifest you will love The Art of Racing in the Rain. This may sound a bit silly, but I feel like this book changed my life in a way!<br /><br />People do not give their animals credit for knowing more about life than what they believe that they know. I am not saying that animals are as intelligent as Enzo, but to convince those who aren't animal lovers, The Art Of Racing In The Rain is a book that could convince you to be otherwise.<br /><br />Please read this book. Just go to your local library and get it as soon as possible! You will NOT be disappointed!
B007THA4FI|5.0|I loved this book- and was sad to see it end- I hope it becomes a series- very different than authors well know works- but very good in a new way.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this everyday. I love the reading plans and I love the fact that you can download different versions of the Bible that can be used offline.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|Provocative subject matter - are we better off with more techonology? Great plot, great ending, but I think the characters could have been &#34;fleshed out&#34; a bit more. In any event, I would recommend this thought provoking book to anyone who uses social media.
B00BAXFCPO|4.0|It spoke directly to me and all the issues in three generations of my family!  I'm going to talk to my Doctor and make sure she has read it.
0316078913|3.0|This is not the goody two shoes funny Christmas stories, yet it gets the point across of what our society looks like from various aspect of David's development.  As many realize, there is a fine line between tragedy and humor and this book blatantly accomplishes this.  It was an okay read for me.
B003VANOFY|2.0|Similar sound quality as the G35, which I also own, but with an amateurish attempt at wireless.<br /><br />Before buying these headphones do a search for &#34;G930 disconnects constantly&#34; and &#34;G930 high pitch whining noise&#34;. You'll see hundreds, even thousands of users facing the same problem.<br /><br />Logitech responds that we should try changing our wireless router settings. Yeah, we've all done that over and over. It doesn't work because the problem isn't our wireless routers. Our problem is Logitech cutting corners on quality to save cost.<br /><br />Save yourself the trouble and get yourself a pair of the G35's. This was Logitech's attempt to enter into the wireless headset market on the cheap, and it shows.
B005723JSQ|5.0|It's a good book to just pass your time. Very entertaining. Keeps you in your toes, it's cute and romantic. It has some funny moments too.
B00A6CCF0K|1.0|There's not much one can say about Stephen King's \\"Doctor Sleep\\" other than it's an obvious ploy on the author's part to make a lot (no, make that a ton) of cash. King writes, people buy, he laughs all the way to the bank. I was a real fan of King's in the early years, the years where his books were true page-turners. Over time, he fell prey to his own celebrity and began turning out bloated novels that became frequently crammed with his personal demons: homophobia, the incessant use of the slang term for fecal matter, characters that act out for no reason, and worst, wasting the reader's time by not seeming to know how (or to care how) to end the story he'd begun. He needs an editor that will tell him the truth and risk his supernatural ire.<br /><br />\\"Doctor Sleep\\" seems to have been written solely to fill a need (or another bank account) by \\"giving the readers what they've asked for all these years\\", the story of Danny Torrance after his stay at the Overlook Hotel. Supremely unfrightening, Danny battles his own demons as a an AA stand-in for King, and a plot device to bridge an overwritten teen girl and a pack of AARP vampire something or others that plod along the US highways in a fleet of RVs. The \\"True Knot\\" (WTH kind of name is that?) routinely suck  the psychic lifeforce out of kiddies that have paranormal power and engage in smelly living conditions (King loves things that smell bad) and of course, creepy gay sex between abused vampire thingie lesbians. Throw in a female villainess named Rose the Hat who is a grrrl power version of guitarist Slash and a lot of AA meetings. That's it. Page after page of filler and then the final throwdown you gave up wondering about between all the protagonists in a finale that is sure to put you to sleep. Maybe King accomplished something after all. Perhaps King wanted to call this yawner of a novel \\"Ambien\\" but couldn't secure use of the drug's name.<br /><br />King is lucky, though. The early books keep the fans coming in hopes that he will return to form, but at this point it seems doubtful. Wonder when the inevitable god-awful movie version of this sad book will appear?
B004QXJZXA|5.0|A classic auto fan movie as well as a classic Steve McQueen movie. If you like car racing, this is it!
B009LMTDL0|1.0|To be fair, I couldn't bring myself to finish this book, so maybe it got better.  It just felt like the first few chapters went on and on and on about how disadvantaged women still are in today's working world.  OK - see I summed it up right there.  I just hate when people dwell on problems...acknowledge them and move on!  I can only hope the rest of the book addresses how to overcome such obstacles, but I couldn't hang in long enough to find out.
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|You will enjoy the laughs. Funny in many points in movie. Does not go to far with jokes to be stupid like other comedies. This is not for the little kiddies but a good comedy for those you like comedies with out all the jokes about crack/pot etc. The movie is about pot smuggling but in a funny way that does not have the characters using drugs during the movie.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Leonard Cohen's  writing is incredible. The master at crafting cerebral highs with words. His multi-year retreat into zen paid off.
B00C7JAAH0|5.0|Its very rare anymore that you can buy a album these days and have every song be a great song but, Lady Antebellum you did it. Love it!!
B0037QO8RK|5.0|Very moving and good depiction on how some live within poverty.  This should not be considered stereotypical of how those who live and grew up in poverty all live, but is a wonderful depiction of one person's struggles and small triumphs.  Great acting.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has great reading plans. It also has multiple versions (as many as you ever wanted). I like the different versions if I need help understanding something I can just change versions and see if it makes since in a different version.
0545586178|4.0|Katniss and Peeta may have both survived the hunger games but that doesn't mean they are safe from danger. Katniss made some powerful enemies in the Capitol when she tricked them into letting both her and Peeta live and they aren't going to stop until they've taken her down. Especially since she has become something of a hero to the districts and has inadvertently caused some of them to start planning a rebellion. Katniss is facing her toughest challenge yet and she risks losing the people she cares about most if she doesn't do some very fast thinking.<br /><br />I still like I'm very much behind the rest of the world when it comes to this series, I read Hunger Games just before the movie came out and had fully intended to carry on reading the series straight away but other books captured my attention and over a year had passed without me picking up Catching Fire. Since the second film is out now I thought it really was time I read the book and I have to say I enjoyed it just as much as the first one. Again I was able to guess some of the major twists before they actually happened but that didn't stop me enjoying the journey.<br /><br />I still really love Katniss, she is so fiercely loyal to those she cares about and will always put her life and her happiness below protecting the people she loves. Sometimes I desperately want her to make the selfish choice and run but I wouldn't like her half as much if she actually did. She is in so much trouble in this book, President Snow is a powerful enemy who is determined to make her pay for her actions during the hunger games. He wants to take her down and he wants to do it publicly to quash the rebellion that is threatening to rise in the districts. It was great to learn a bit more about how Panem is run but I do still have a lot of questions about how the districts were created in the first place that I'm hoping will be answered in the final book of the trilogy.<br /><br />I don't want to say too much about the plot but I will say that we are introduced to some fabulous new characters along with getting the chance to catch up with old favourites. I still wish we'd spent more time with Gale but have high hopes he'll have a much larger role in the next book. I was firmly on his team in the first book, although I liked Peeta I just didn't feel he was the right guy for Katniss. Peeta needed her to look after him while Gale would be an equal partner. I have to admit that while I still want her to end up with Gale I did start to see more of a connection between Katniss and Peeta in this book, he shows several times how much she means to him and he definitely seems to have matured and come into his own a bit more. I'm kind of torn now but I don't think I'll be too upset whoever she ends up with. The last few chapters of Catching Fire were intense and they have left me desperate to know how the series concludes. There are things I know I'd like to see happen but I'm not sure if they will or not and I don't think I'll be able to wait long before I read Mockingjay to find out!will say that we are introduced to some fabulous new characters along with getting the chance to catch up with old favourites.

B000E9910W|5.0|The CD is GREAT - I can't stop listening to it!  Many of the songs on the CD I had never heard before!
630463949X|5.0|This is an excellent concert for fleetwood mac. I am a long time fan, total fan, absolutely love them, and this concert is undeniably one of their best. If you get any fleetwood mac concert get this one, it's better than live in Boston, it's awesome. Get this one !!!
B009EHDU7U|5.0|A very tall story and a fabulous yarn! Unlike anything I've read before. Do yourself a favour and read it.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|This is a great movie! Luv the story line. The cast of characters were awsome. This is a definite must see movie. Not one dull moment n this movie, at all. Jessica Chastain was superb! Didn't know this really existed.....the family n the business they were in. Costumes were something, really made the story. I think I wrote about this before, no matter, I wud highly reccomend .
B00G922EA2|3.0|This game has potential. I liked all that I played BUT the game ended to abruptly. I feel this game didn't really live up to its title nor was it long enough to warrant the price tag. Personally I feel I &quot;won&quot; per I received game free during promotion. The sequel (if there is one/ever is one) would have to be quite long and very detailed in order to make up for the multiple details this game lacked. All of this is my opinion and I did like what I saw but definitely think the game was cut off too soon. I have purposefully omitted details of the game so as not to spoil the fame for others. I give this game a 3 for the ending (too abrupt)<br />,price tag and too much back and forth for the character, IMO.<br /> If there s a sequel I would play it just to fill in all the gaps left by the first game.
B008G59IBI|5.0|Great CD all around! Again, took my BFF a year to listen to the whole CD thanks to a 3 year old that rules the music on car rides...but she stated &#34; I Just Love Green Day!&#34;
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|Nostalgia aside, this is a better Superman film than any we've ever seen.  I am, admittedly, young enough that the Donner films hold no special power over me.  I also liked Superman Returns, and thought it was the best film prior to this one, obvious flaws and all.  As a fan of Superman in comics and animated cartoons, this movie is the best representation of him I have seen.  In some ways it falls behind, and in others it surpasses the source material.  As a film, I love it.  And as for Superman, he does so many things here that I always wish he would do.
B00GIXY4M8|3.0|It was very different, but good enugh to hold my attention! Was a bit to long n drawn out especially at the beginning. The sequences that showed Logan dreaming reminds me of the movie, The Grey wth Liam Neesom! Not sure if these movies r following each other n not giving us the viewers enugh credit to know, we hv seen that sceneiro n it's getting old! I wud still encourage others to view it, some great fighting scenes. The end of movie was a given, we know it's coming....the next installment!
B004EBZX6W|2.0|It doesn't seem to do much, I can't get it to do a bandwidth test, which is the main reason I wanted it, and frankly just seeing what networks are available in the area and their relative strength is something any device does out of the box.  Maybe there is more to this app than I'm seeing but if there was, I certainly couldn't find it.
B007HO392S|5.0|I gave this as a Christmas Gift to my BFF. She has finally a year later told me that she loves it. Apparently while driving in her car, her 3 year old dictates the radio, so it has taken her a year to listen to the whole CD! But she says it was worth the time to listen to Carrie Underwood.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|This is still my favorite album of all time. I have purchased multiple copies of it and listened to it hundreds of times. The lyrics and voices are haunting. The music is so layered and beautiful. Each song is rich with multiple instruments. If you like music with heart and depth, you should give it a listen.
B00EEDNA4M|1.0|I waited about six weeks for the delivery got it,opened it today and the top hinge is broke on the barrel : ( Paid 199.00
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|I'm re-Kindle-ing my relationship with Pendergast, going back through the older stuff to remind myself why I liked them so much in book form.<br />The newer Pendergast material seems a bit uneven, but White Fire is definitely on the up part of the cycle. The Sherlock Holmes tale was innovative and fun, and the modern day murdering was typically creative.<br />My favorites in the Pendergast series include Cabinet of Curiosities and Still Life with Crows. White Fire doesn't reach that level, but it's miles higher than that godawful novel about the runaway cruise ship from a few years back.<br />Pendergast fans won't be disappointed.
B0058YPGSY|1.0|I don't know. . I would never watch this<br />and really don't recall ordering it ...It is<br />certainly nothing that would appeal to<br />my conscience,
B00FATEJYE|5.0|One of the best games available for the kindle.  I can't put it down.  Hopefully it stays free to download
B00CWY76CC|4.0|No way to get hints. A great challenge.<br /><br />Can't wait for new rooms. It will make you think or throw stuff.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|It has been fun to reread these stories and to have them all in one volume.  Great set at a great price.
1416550550|4.0|I really enjoyed the book; however, it was a little difficult to keep changing characters and years--especially reading a small amount each day you might forget what happened previously.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|GREAT SERIES, IT KEEPS YOU INTERESTED IN WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT. aLSO JUST MORE FUN THEN SOME OF THE NEWER TYPE SERIES.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is a great, if not very sad, and well written story. I couldn't put it down!  Would recommend it to anyone.
B005LAIGP0|5.0|We recently saw the original play in London so I just had to order this movie version.  It did not disappoint at all.  Daniel Radcliffe is great in the lead role.  Slightly different than the play but just as good.
B003MC5L9S|5.0|I will keep going back and keep drawing from this wonderful guide-book, a torch-light for the life-time. Thank you Mr. Murphy.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|It doesn't update the newsfeed very good. I can't figure it out but there are missing statuses, old statuses with a few new ones thrown in. It's a mess.
B0002DKCMG|5.0|OMG what a funny movie. This has become a cult classic and a movie you have to see. This is just to funny for words.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Fast moving and very entertaining. Truly enjoyed the book and the series.  It is even better than the movie.  I recommend it.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|This book sits on my nightstand so I can keep re-reading it. I also have the kindle edition. I love this book; it totally changed the way I think.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I had my doubts about the 7.1 sound, but I can now hear directional sounds in games like Call of Duty Ghosts. (Such as if the noise is coming from in front of me, or in back, or even if its on the second floor, etc). Its incredible!  My multiplayer score has increased dramatically and I now get called a hacker. I want to tell them that its thanks to my headphones that I can now hear them coming, but we don't want to give all our game play secrets away to the competition do we?
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Outstanding and a wonderful singer. Michael Buble is one of the very best and he truly can sing like an angel.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Very very well written, easy flow to the story. Held my interest throughout the entire book. I could not put it down. I can not wait to see the movie. It will be interesting to see how they handle the story telling.
B00D2CYU2W|1.0|I was aware of  Liberache's life, however some of the content<br />of the movie was down right gross.<br />The cast of the movie were quite good.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Based on reviews and warnings--thank you to all who submitted reviews warning of the invasion of privacy with this program.  I will search elsewhere.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I made rhis purchase for my seven and nine year old and they love it. It keeps them occupied while im doing mommy stuff.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Great character development, interesting story.  Couldn't put it down.  Gillian is an amazing storyteller.  Such content with detail.  This will keep you on the edge of your seat!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great SiFi. Very suspenseful. Now I have to get the Kindle book and start a new hobby, reading! Can't wait for the sequel.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Great characters and character development and a complex and engaging plot. I can't wait for the next season to begin.
B0093H8HXS|4.0|Yes this processor is pretty good! I mean I don't necessarily like it i'm a gamer and like recording / rendering video's etc and it is pretty slow in these things (I think it even bottlenecks my video card). I acknowledged that this isn't necessarily a gaming processor but yeah it's still pretty good for the price!
B00BEIYH6U|5.0|It's awesome. It is a well made follow up to the first movie.  Altough not exactly like the previous movie, nor should be, it is a good continuation that any real fan should enjoy. There are new heroes inspired by kick ass' stand from the first film, and many more villains recruited by the Mobster's surviving son.  It has very gripping scenes where you aren't sure some of those new heroes, both amateur and naive or the experienced and skilled, are able to handle and survive the realism of the streets and real bad guys... It gets really intense.  You have to watch.  It is full of surprises, serious dangerous, and humorous situations. It deserves to be right next to the first.<br /><br />What I like this time was the greater push and reflect on character development for kick ass and hit girl  This sequel includes inspiration from both Hit-Girl and Kick Ass 2 comic story lines.  This movie shows a fun journey for hit-girl where she has to confront being a \\"real girl\\", high school,  her newly discovered feelings for guys..all the while she and kick ass both have to decided if they are meant to really be heroes or retire those thoughts when things become more threatening. Buy, Watch, and Enjoy!
B001BKVWYQ|5.0|Watch the dvd, Searching for Sugarman and you can't help but love this album.  The story behind the Rodriguez is super cool.....inspiring!!!!!
B003H4I4JU|3.0|I liked it and I believe many Sci-Fi fans would, but unlike Enders Game it may be a little abstract or heavy for the heavy for the average reader.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|You will not be able to put this down and will challenge yourself to beat the game!!! I'm still trying to beat my best score and get 3 stars at every level I complete....
B00FN811SY|5.0|Best translation,most accurate,easy to use,with other translations at your fingertips.Most important is the name of<br />God,Jehovah , shown in the places where it was found in the original text! Thank you!
B00DI75SWM|4.0|I really like the concept of this app. It is a really good time consumer.<br />I would have given it 5 stars if you could save your posters to your gallery. Overall a good app. Kudos to the developers.
B005O64VJQ|5.0|This movie is one of my all time favorites. This was a re-purchase. The previous possession was abducted in a divorce settlement
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Many details that I need are missing; ie: wind direct at what speed; miles visibility<br />ceiling. Graphics and presntation are OK,
B005BDZN62|5.0|It is an older movie.  I have owned the soundtrack, the videocassette, the DVD, and the Blu-ray disc of West Side Story.  I like the story and the music of Leonard Bernstein.  I have listened to his music when he conducted the New York Philharmonic.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|this game is a cool card game one of the best card games.I like the backgrounds<br />and how it is free because I&acute;m cheep
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|Without fail, this writing team delivers the goods: original plots, riveting suspense, and breath-taking action. Pendergast is always certified fresh and unlike any other protagonist.  In this story, perhaps the boundaries of possibility were pushed just a bit beyond my ability to grasp, and a couple of plot devices were used to leave me reeling and hurting - a bit of a cheat - but, all in all, it was the roller coaster ride I've come to expect from this series.  A little gruesome, of course, but that's hardly a departure from the tradition of the stories.  Well worth the effort.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|If you see it, you'll understand.  Definitely one ,of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  Randy Quade steals the show.
B00005LK94|5.0|This is a fascinating story about the domestication of a flock of goslings.  They are returned to their natural life to the extend of teaching them to migrate by following human direction in a plane.  A young girl flies one of the planes and in the end she is flying alone when they reach their destination.  I believe it is based on a true story.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This is one of the best games that I have played for a long time. I Love how it is set up like marvel vs capcom.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|This was an excellent movie. I had no idea what to expect because I hadn't even watched a trailer for it. It's very hard to describe how this movie makes you feel but it has a very powerful message and you can't help but love this guy.
B00004W221|5.0|I've seen this movie at least ten times.  It ALWAYS makes me cry like a little kid.  The fact that it's based on a true story is amazing.  There are lessons we all can learn from.  I think there's a little guy like Rudy in all of us.  It's a testament to what can be achieved through sheer determination, no matter what the odds are.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|Really enjoyed this entire trilogy. The second book was a bit slow until they hit the city. Then it really picks up. Love the characters and the plot is very unique.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like this game a lot but if you don't have face book then you have to do quest to get more levels I'm on level 40 because I had to do quest but other wise it's great!
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Bond, James Bond! This version in the Bond series did not let me down.  It had all of the Action, mystery and surprises that made it extremely entertaining.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is my favorite<br />I play it every day when I get home from school<br />And if u didn't know you can sign up and get bonuses
1451666179|5.0|I've only read a few &#34;chapters&#34; of this book, but I am in love with it.  It is so funny.  The illustrations are hilariously simple and the sentiments are so easy to relate to.  The book is great as you don't have to sit down and read the whole thing.  It is like as book of short stories.  It is very simply and casually written and really feels like Allie is just having a friendly, and entertainingly illustrated, conversation with the reader.<br /><br />I am looking forward to reading the rest of the stories in this book.
B007SGM084|4.0|I am only a teenager (soon to be 20) and even though this book is meant for older women I have really enjoyed reading this trilogy. For me, it was the romance and the drama. A must read for anyone  and everyone!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John green is one of my favorite authors and this book of his does not disappoint. Read this book...you won't regret it!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Entertaining and easily addicting.  You will spend hours playing this game if you aren't careful.  A good game if you are haven't to sit and wait, i.e. doctor's office, airport lounge or just killing time at home.
B000002J0B|3.0|There are two songs on here that I skip. Track 2 and 4. Track 2 is a typical acoustic Zep song that doesn't impress and track 4 is some kind of Rod Stewart sounding crap. Other than that the rest are good.<br /><br />No Quarter is actually the song that really got me into this band despite the fact that it isn't really their type of song and more of a Pink Floyd rip off.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It seems like every kid loooooove Subway Surfers! My children likest it dearly!!!! Once they start playing it, they play it for a while. It actually allow children with ADHD to sit and considerate, while they are having fun without awareness of being sitting for a while. On the same token, it's therapy-ed them unintentionally. That is why I love Samsung product for many reason of helping children including adult to cope with life differently.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|It's a James Bond movie. What else can be said? It was a good movie and I liked the new money penny.
1439192812|5.0|All Dawkins' books are great!!!!!!!!  This man blends logic with truth to create a compelling counter argument to all those pseudo-religious nut cases out there.
B00000295Y|4.0|It's amazing how well this album stands up over 20 years.<br />I wasn't really into this when it came out. It didn't seem as fresh as their first album and this one came out about six months after 'The Chronic' so obviously hip hop fans were heavily intoxicated by that G-funk sound.<br />This album was totally different but very good in a more narrow way.
0679746048|3.0|This 169 page book is a relatively quick read--some of the 'chapters' are less than a page and a half long. The beginning of the book confused me a little at first. The first 15 pages made very little sense to me. They seemed kindof random, and even out-of-place. After that, the author actually begins telling the story, and it becomes much easier to understand (and thus much more entertaining).  I found it interesting that the book includes some pictures of what seems to be official paperwork. Personally, I'm fascinated by that sort of thing, so I was particularly intrigued by it.  As for the content of the book itself, except for the first 15 pages it's a fascinating, humorous, and even sad read. (Though some of the scenes are &#34;uh...what&#34; worthy.) Kaysen talks about some of her fellow patients, and their stories can be heart-wrenching. I especially liked the ice cream scene and &#34;The Martian's Girlfriend.&#34;  Once you start reading, it's very difficult to put down because you're dying to know what happens next. This is going on my must-read list. I felt like the book was aimed towards a younger audience, though: so those looking for something more in-depth may want to look elsewhere.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Fun game to play. Challenging and competitive . Play against players with different skill levels. Many different types of equipment.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|amazing, why I need to write a certain number of word for this film is beyond me.  This should be in any Sci fi fans collection
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Let me know if the class action suit gets rolling. I am a fan of Google, but this device way supposed to allow me to cast anything from Chrome to the TV. Not the case. You tube and netflix?  I do not want to post my videos on YouTube and NetFlix lame, and another monthly fee.<br /><br />I am significantly disappointed but more than anything it will make me question a future purchase of Google products if they continue with this : sell it one way and then mandatory update it to strip it of its great functions ... I bet there is another product coming to sell those features back to the public.<br /><br />That is just plain criminal!
B0052REUW0|4.0|A wonderfully written and insightful book, like all Pinker's books.  It might deserve five stars but I gave it only 4 (4 and one half would be better) because it badly needed a more aggressive edit.  Pinker makes his case well, but he could have made it just as well in fewer pages, more tightly focused on the central themes.
B008YE9226|4.0|This novel was confusing when I started to read it. I pushed forward and discovered through the confusion there was an intriguing plot. Ancient Gods of all cultures around the world versus what humans are beginning to worship today; technology, cell phones, computers, and internet. In the past people clung to their religions and beliefs every day. Today, people can't leave their cell phones more then a few feet away.<br />One of the old Gods, Mr. Wednesday, decides to start a war against these new Gods of technology. Gaiman untwists the mystery to reveal shocking truths about human nature.<br />This book is for intelligent people who an read through the lines and understand the underlying message.
B001DJ7PMI|5.0|Kennedy was gunned down. MOM as in means opportunity and motive are well established. Many significant people wanted him dead. You decide
B0002TJGQS|1.0|Batteries had sticky brown-yellow residue on them INSIDE the package. And they didn't even work. All of them were dead.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|Excellent book.  The author's advice is based on the best academic research.  ...Not the made-up sh*t that the typical self help author comes up with.  It's worth your time to seriously read, study, and implement the author's advice.  It's made a difference in my life and it will in yours if you actually incorporate the author's principles into your life.<br /><br />This book is best accompanied by also reading the author's latest book &#34;Before Happiness: The 5 Hidden Keys to Achieving Success, Spreading Happiness, and Sustaining Positive Change&#34;.  The two books definitely go together.<br /><br />I also got the audible version of the above 2 books and listen to them while driving around and exercising at the gym.  Each time I listen, I understand his principles more deeply.
0061733199|5.0|Great Book!! Full of I formation....one of the better survival books on the market and would high recommend to everyone.
B000J103PC|3.0|Pretty good; the insight into the world of high fashion in itself is of interest,  and of course Ms. Streep puts forth an outstanding performance as that &#34;Devil&#34;, as she does with everything. There's some acceptable middle-of-the-road moralizing to it as well.
B000L53D4O|3.0|We already had it for like 6 months. My son uses it sometimes but doesn't love it. He plays with the toys in the front for just a short time. What I really don't like is that the toy is very very light and has no breaks so it moves forward very easily and the baby can lose balance and fall forward. I fixed this by putting some soft rubber weights on top of the yellow bars.
B00BAXFAJC|2.0|As a lover of literary fiction and nineteenth century novels, I anticipated a great deal of pleasure from The Luminaries.  I was undaunted by its length and intrigued by its &#34;dark and stormy&#34; beginnings, as well as the astrological associations which seemed sure to be clarified as the story continued. I was also excited to learn more about the history of New Zealand, a topic on which I am deficient.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book's early promise was lost in the excruciating pace of the many, many pages that followed.  The characters were flat and unsympathetic; despite the  drawn-out explications of their inner workings and backstories, I couldn't bring myself to care about them much.  I am astonished that this book won the Man Booker prize and frankly, surprised that the positive and negative reviews on Amazon are almost equally balanced; it was a waste of time and money for this reader.
B00CNQ7CRI|2.0|What a disappointment!  I did read the whole thing, but I found it very tedious and jumpy.  You could see the end coming way down the road--just took too long to get to it.
B00005JN0T|4.0|A faithful exploration of the implications of Asimov's &#34;Rules of Robots&#34;, Another case of excellent intentions gone awfully wrong, worth it for the moral interest alone.
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|Although a prequel, this was still a very enjoyable movie.  Most characters from the original are incorporated into this movie and it ties together nicely.  I have a 3 year old and watch it several times a week and still chuckle here and there.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Just what the doctor ordered. This amped up my IPOD touch enough where I didn't have get all audiophile over e​verything. I added the Line out dock, and a set of headphones and I am very happy with EQ and volume. Can't go wrong for the price if this is what you are looking to do.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This is a very good movie.  It is one of those movies you can watch over and over.  Would recommend
B00FXMGI0G|3.0|The reason I bought the original movie RED(1) was because of the commercials I had seen for RED 2 on TV. RED (1) was really funny and good, but RED 2 was mostly a disapointment.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Little boring but not too bad. Wish it was more lively it lacks pizzazz. But I love horses so what what iever.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies, I love futuristic pics and the possibilities that they bring to ones imagination. Loved it!!
B0064W667Y|4.0|I love it, but I fell inlove with Fairest more than Fables. I will read the series anyway, its very entertaining.
B00GP0G0IK|2.0|Downloaded the game and started playing not realizing it was only a teaser. I  understand the logic, but just make it a pay app &amp; don't waste my time with letting me in to try and get me addicted. Love  the gameplay. Hate the price and the false hope. 99&cent; I'm in. $5.28.... I don't think so. Goodbye g5.
0552769762|1.0|This seller was lire which use image to trick you think about it was a set but when I received it was different prints and size were different not as image show on is store pade
B005LAII0I|4.0|This film was liked very much especially because Julia Roberts was in it. My granddaughter liked it but did not love it.
