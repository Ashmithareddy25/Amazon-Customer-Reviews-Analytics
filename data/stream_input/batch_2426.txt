B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I confess I don't read a lot of contemporary fiction; in particular New Adult. I pretend that it's because of many reasons. I say that I think it's a cash cow simply adding sex to YA, the covers are just begging for me to snark at them and the formula is so ridiculous it can't possibly be taken seriously; damaged girl + hot guy with a magic peen multiplied by a bucket load of issues divided by lots of hot sex = Happily Ever After. For the most part those reasons are fairly accurate but if I'm completely honest it's because every now and then I'll open an NA book, sniff and snark at it at first and then crumble to the floor as it rips my heart and stomach out until by the last page I'm crawling around blindly trying to put the pieces of my mind back together and usually failing miserably.<br /><br />Hopeless by Colleen Hoover was such a book.<br /><br />If I had to sum it up in one word: Brutal. There's no denying this book is stellar, it hooked me from page one and it didn't let go no matter how much I inwardly begged at times. My Goodreads status updates can attest to as much. It affected me more than I thought possible. I ranted, I cried, I scoffed, I even swooned. For the girl who prefers to step into the worlds of vampires, shadowhunters and fae, this book was an eye-opener to the quality of contemporary fiction out there that I continually deny myself, flicking past it on my kindle saying \\"for another time.\\"<br /><br />Sky is almost eighteen. Adopted, she has been home-schooled all her life, living a technology free existence, escaping into a world of books. Her only friend, Six, lives next door and together they spend their time, eating ice-cream, watching movies and making out with boys. Sky can't figure out why is it that when a boy touches her she goes numb, unfeeling, bored. No boy has ever made her stomach jump, her skin tingle or her heart flutter. When she finally persuades her mom to allow her to attend public school for her senior year her life is changed when she meets the mysterious Holder with whom she instantly feels a connection with. As Sky finds her emotions and body responding to this boy like never before, the mysteries of her past come flooding to the surface and together they must figure out who Sky really is and what she has buried deep within her soul.<br /><br />Its 24 hours since I finished and my mind is still reeling from this book. I don't think I'll ever be able to truly comprehend the effect it has had on me. The words just flowed perfectly, I never felt like I was detached, an observer looking in. Hoover hooked me right into the pages and made me experience every unflinching moment of brilliance.<br /><br />I won't lie, this book messed with my head big time. The thing that bothers me the most about NA is that for every damaged girl there's always this unbelievable guy who always says the right thing and is so open and honest with his feelings and let's face it, no guy really talks like that, only guys written by women do and girls like Sky who experience such horrifying events in real life don't get those happy endings. They won't be saved but instead will have to save themselves, and it's amazing and staggering to even try and comprehend their strength and ability to recover from that but why isn't their story told?<br />Why aren't those women getting attention? Why is it always some guy who comes along and magically sees into their soul that solves all the problems? Here is where I think NA fails women as it's another form of the fairy tale that only serves to remind us that in RL there is no Knight on a White Horse. Why can't women ever be their own white knight?<br /><br />Despite that, I'm glad that in this book Sky does have Holder to support her through her trauma. It breaks my heart to think of her without him because I don't think she could cope. However Sky was truly a heroine in her own right, her ability to keep going as the memories of her past came flooding back to her, her bravery in battling the urge to retreat back into herself and forcing herself to feel was staggering. She never once fell, she stayed standing, resolute. Her ability to forgive, to understand and to accept was truly admirable. I don't know if I could find the strength. Holder; who at first appeared to be the typical NA brooding, growling hunk and that I eye rolled at more than once turned out to be sweet, charming, caring and brave as he too was forced to accept that his perception of the past and his reality were world's apart.<br /><br />There are moments in the book that really ripped my heart out, when Sky is lying on her bed, counting the stars on her ceiling, trying to escape the pain I went there with her and it enraged me because this is what's happening every day. Sky uses her sexuality as a weapon. Not against anybody else, against her own pain. It's the only way she can escape what has been done to her. When she joins public school she is called a slut and finds post-its on her locker with choice insults. While she brushes them off, it highlights another theme in popular fiction - Slut shaming. Why does this exist? And worse why are women the worst offenders? This year two trials in America have made international news as girls who were gang-raped and had their pictures shared on social media sites were treated like \\"sluts\\" and vilified by media and the public for \\"asking for it\\" because of their clothes, alcohol consumption, looks while the boys were treated with sympathy because such a terrible trial meant their promising futures were ruined. Why? Because Rape Culture has taught us that if the guy is good looking, well educated or comes from a \\"good\\" family then it's impossible for them to be guilty of such a heinous crime because let's face it - any girl would be lucky to have their attention...<br /><br />Hoover while featuring slut-shaming thankfully for the most part treats the subject of abuse, sex and grief with the utmost respect and created a book that really challenges your perceptions and preconceptions on so many taboo subjects. She creates characters that you fall in love with, care so deeply for you feel they are your own friends and you would do anything to protect them. She doesn't shy away from the hard issues writing scenes that were stomach churning and took your breath away. Her brutal honesty was admirable but hard to take at times. In one scene, Sky begs Holder to take her pain away by having sex, allowing her to retreat into herself so she could forget all that she had just been put through, and as I read the scene, one thought that struck me was how Holder could go through with it. The person he's in love with is drowning in so much grief and trauma yet he's able to get aroused? I couldn't get my head around this at first, despite the knowledge we're fed that men look at sex differently and are more capable of disassociating it from emotions it wasn't until I realised that Hoover was probably right. It probably is realistic that in such a situation a person is able to let the physical nature of the act take over but I won't lie it made me feel ill.<br /><br />But in a weird way that's precisely what I loved about this book. I have read so many books where a couple of days later I can't tell you the name of the MC, what the plot was, who the author was. Hoover wrote a book that I don't think I'll ever forget. The characters, Sky and Holder, soul mates who took me on a journey of love, discovery, grief and recovery, two lost children stumbling through life until they found each other will always be remembered as they lie under the stars and hook their pinkies together in the most innocent display of pure love; the storyline that captivated me from the stunning prologue through reveal after reveal after reveal until the ending when I thought I finally had it all figured out and no way could she best me again when she took the knees out from under me and left me breathless, speechless but thankfully - not hopeless.that really challenges your perceptions and preconceptions on so many taboo subjects.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book. It was great and I would recommend it to anyone. You should read this because it's amazing.
B009FAQ9JW|2.0|&#34;Digitally remastered&#34;. Using what a fax machine? I gave up after the opening scene. Still hoping someday they'll release decent version of this movie.
B0011MZOEI|5.0|Bruce Willis saves the world yet again. Good story line and Timothy Olifant is supurb. His job in the film led me to &#34;Hitman&#34; and his TV series &#34;Justified&#34;.
B00B4MUSHI|5.0|Each song from the game is included, both with vocals (if any vocals exist) and as pure instrumentals. This is good, since the game switched between the two.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Finally Finished with the series loved it so much . Gonna read next series. You're an interesting writer . You're Awesome
B0063GORYU|5.0|I totally recommend this one. I have tried others and none can compare to the fun and easy play.  I looked for this for Windows 8 but did not find it.  I really find this app so addicitive I want one now for Windows 8!!
B0081336FO|5.0|Probably the best series I have ever watched! I fully recommend it to anyone out there. Its witty, funny and smart!
B000QCQ970|5.0|This is an excellent book. I tend to studiously avoid the self-help books, but if I could make an exception for only one book, this would be it.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game. I would highly recommend anyone to at least try it once if you like manning.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A friend recommended Wool and it certainly did not disappoint.  By the time I got to 4 I stayed up half the night to finish.  I really enjoyed the character development and how one story flowed into the next. Without spoiling it for anyone who hasn't read it, I did not expect the ending but it was worth it.
B005H29GSI|5.0|I am so satisfied and the price was very affordable.. I have no complaints at all and will be buying again in the future..came real quick in great condition.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I really thought this book started out strong. Then about a quarter of the way through I realized the relationship that Abby has with Travis is so wrong. He is so dependent on her love that he literally stops functioning when she isn't around. This made me uncomfortable and I nearly stopped reading the story because of it.<br /><br />I continued on, and I realized EVERY relationship she has is like that. Her best friend can't go to parties without her, her father is a epic failure and can't live a normal life without her coming in to save him, Travis and his family are dependent on her. She draws these people to her because she is needy as well. This girl frustrated me.<br /><br />I would give this 3.5 stars. It was a decent read, but just too many needy people in one book for my taste.  That being said, I will be reading Walking Disaster when it comes out next week.  Every woman I know LOVES Travis and I am hoping that through his point of view, I will figure out why.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Riveting series!  I couldn't stay away if I tried.  Kevin Bacon is amazing and the plot line is incredibly suspenseful.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These guys are amazing, and their music is awesome.  They're incredible musicians and create music that's uplifting and enjoyable to listen to.  I hope they do more, but with their style, a dvd would be even better.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|My Husband and I really enjoyed this video.  The quality of the older footage is great.  This was remastered very well.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Everything about Downton Abbey is excellent!  Great programming for the entire family!!  Can't wait to watch Season 4!!  We have watched each episode, twice!  Well worth the $$ .
B00BZOFUI2|5.0|I have not been a fan of Deep Purple since the 60's or 70's like some people.  When I got old enough to appreciate heavy metal and hard rock back in the 90's, I started exploring Black Sabbath.  While doing so, I came across Born Again and was aware of the fact that Ian Gillan was the lead sing of Deep Purple.  I was intrigued.  My sister let me borrow Machine Head and it blew me away.  Every song was great.  I feel in love with Blackmore's solo's immediately, and that is where my love for Deep Purple began.  I ran out and started picking up every Deep Purple album one by one.  I'm a child of the 80's, so obviously Perfect Strangers made a lasting impact on me.  The riffs, the excitement...it was all there.  I found a bootleg of House of Blue Light and it became one of my favorite cd's.  I picked up Battle Rages On...every other song was my favorite song...it's funny, if you listen to that album and to Rainbow's Stranger in us All, you'll see that every other song is awesome...it's true...Then something crazy happened.  Blackmore left and they had this new guys, Steve Morse.  I heard him first on a live bootleg.  Everything had changed.  Instead of opening with Highway Star, they started opening with Fireball...they started playing songs that they hadn't played live in years...and then Perpendicular...I mean, what can I say...it's a great album, almost every song is first rate...it was the beginning of something magical...but like many things, it didnt live up to it's potential.  Abandon, Bananas, Rapture...all good albums.  All had SOME great songs...and a lot of ok songs...I find myself listening to a few specific songs on those albums and skipping the majority of the rest.  I mean, the other songs are ok...but boring...On Rapture, Money Talks, Rapture, Clearly Quite Absured....they are great...the rest...mostly blah...except for the last song...but 75% BLAH...This album is different.  I've had it for a week, and I cant stop listening to it.  And I cant stop starting the album right from the beginning each time.  I love it.  And it gets better each time I play it.  The first time I played it, there were probably 2-3 songs I considered fillers...Now, not only do I love the other songs, but I'm starting to appreciate the \\"fillers\\"...I know people were \\"misinformed\\" and thought this was going to be some sort of Machine Head 2 or something...but it's not...it's not like anything they've done before...which is the best part of it.  They've never been so progressive as they are on this album.  Dont let anyone fool you...this is a great Deep Purple CD...If you are a true fan, like me...you wont stop listening to this album.  It's not Blackmore and Lord...which is fine...it's great music...Enjoy!
0307387178|5.0|He was crazy yet admirable all at once. I think people would call him a reckless idiot, but at least he died while doing something he liked. Traveling and learning about the world on his own. I think he has quite the artistic spirit. Doing what he wants, when he wants, no matter the cost in order to gain knowledge in an unorthodox yet heroic way with those naturalistic notions. Everyone has dreamed of walking out the door and going on a journey to discover the world in his or her own way at some point right? I kind of respect him for actually going through with it. But haha I would never do it myself, because I just don't value the experience enough to risk my life the way he did. Also, I'm a girl so I'd probably get raped trying to hitchhike across the country on my own. which would suck.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Everything about Downton Abbey is excellent!  Great programming for the entire family!!  Can't wait to watch Season 4!!  We have watched each episode, twice!  Well worth the $$ .
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I was thoroughly entertained throughout the book. Its obvious that he knows a lot of science and NASA's procedures. his sense of humor adds just the right touch. I'm looking for more work from Andy Weir, but he's lying low. Can't wait for his next book!
038533348X|5.0|It was in good condition as listed and I loved the story haha! I couldn't put it down, I had to read it in one go. This story seems messed up and crazy on the surface, but has some pretty deep themes to it. It was exciting, fast-paced, mysterious, and hilarious all at once. A very modern story.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I am a longtime SF/F fan and I was enthralled by this series.  Was this digital version the best format for reading these books?  No, but the price was perfect, so I won't dwell on that.  This series is everything you've heard and more - complex characters, multiple integrated plots, intricate descriptions and a rich mythology. The mystery is, how did I remain unaware of this series for so long?  Mind boggling.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I think this calculator is a joy to use. Very easy to use . I can't<br />  believe  it's free. I recommend it for math  challenged people
0393964582|5.0|decently clean, a bit smelly with that old book smell, but that's to be expected. Good enough to use for AP Literature.
B00CHILW64|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen this year! Very good performances and an outstanding story line. Special effects are great.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Have to watch it from the beginning..very intense.  Also,  when you think you have it figured out, something new happens and tjen think &#34;wrong again&#34;
0670033375|5.0|I bought this because I needed it for a class. From an academic perspective, it's very good and interesting, but for me, it's not an enjoyment read, but none-the-;less, very interesting. If you enjoy environmental issues, I'm sure you'll love it, and the author is well known as well!
159315724X|5.0|For aspiring entrepreneurs, including young men and women on their way up--and anybody else aiming for success--Darren Hardy's book, \\"The Compound Effect,\\" provides a dose of smart how-to tips, great advice and common sense with one bottom line: what we do, or don't do, adds up to determine how far we go. Not complex or complicated, it's a philosophy that has made all the difference for Hardy who shares his wisdom and advice in an easy-to-digest and personal story. Inspiring and encouraging!
1932735410|3.0|In the memory of Rita Mulcahy (past away May 15, 2010) - she was an exceptional professional, successful entrepreneur, and heroic life fighter.<br /><br />However, neither the PMP Exam Prep book nor PMPFastrack software (sold separately or as a bundle but way overpriced) are not good enough as a single tool for exam preparation, unfortunately. The book is too wordy and more just for learning rater than training. Some important areas are not uncovered enough or at all. Some parts are confusing or not going along with PMBOK. The book is more like \\"here is what you have to know about the project management\\" rather than \\"here is what you have to focus on to pass the EXAM\\". The questions and answers in the book and in the PMPFastrack software are structured differently than the real exam: less complex, not enough wordy where should be or too wordy where it's not really needed for training in preparation for PMP Certification Exam but not too bad for testing your PM knowledge in general. Also, PMPFastrack software is way overpriced, and valid only for only 12 months - you won't be able using it after that period.<br /><br />Pros.<br />Both the book and exam simulator give you a clue and train you to practice with different ways of the questioning.<br /><br />Cons.<br />This book without exam simulator is not good enough, however PMPFastrack software confuses you vs the questions/answers structure and wording of the real exam, which is more complex. Exam is testing both your abilities to understand different approaches of questioning, knowledge of the details and understanding of insight; although, the timing requires your fast reading skills (very important!) and focus on keywords.<br /><br />Recommendation.<br />To structure your training select one of the books as a base (Andy Crowe, Head First PMP, or PMP Exam Prep) and use other resources if something is not clear - tons are available for free on the web. Use different exam simulation tools until you reach (200 questions within 3.5 h) at least 90%, under 60 seconds average, confirming this score successively 3 times within 5-6 days. There are very good FREE of charge exam simulating tools, and lots of free training resources on the Internet. Expect to be disturbed on the exam, walking in/out, speaking loudly behind the wall, it could be quite chilly or very hot inside of the room without air venting (happened to me).<br /><br />This comment is made based on over 20 years of PM experience and use of the last three editions of this book and software as an alternative training material.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|This dvd is as close to the original regarding picture, quality, sound, etc. It is a great dvd to add to your collection of classics. Arrived quickly and in tact.
B00AEBB9SM|5.0|This movie is a new classic, it is thought provoking especially now in the age of reality TV. One of my favorite Jim Carrey movies for sure.
B009A882D0|5.0|I have always been a huge fan of Credence Clearwater and this CD brought back a lot of great memories.
B004NELBPC|1.0|I am an avid reader of Huffington Post and was pleased to get this app.  All that ended quickly after opening the first article to read.... The font couldn't be any smaller and there is no apparent way to stretch the page to increase the font.  Total waste of time as it currently functions.
B0098XY5VK|3.0|Good game, but repetitive you grill the same three hot dogs and two hamburgers with fries and lemonade  or soda throughout different venues you can had different condiments  however,I had no trouble downloading the full version<br />So if you have some time to kill this game will keep you occupied for a while.
B0064MGU98|4.0|Dramatic plot and engaging legal stories. Also, good acting. I like the mix of the court room story combined with a mother dealing with big family and marital issues.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It cannot end here, there's got to be more. Keep them coming E. L. James. I have really enjoyed all three of the these books
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|The best TV series ever produced! I can wait till Sunday to watch it again.  We love it! It is a great show
B00459GJUM|5.0|It's a shame there's no space sifi on TV today.  Used to have several, now none. Bring it back.  Too bad.

B00BQPEIT2|5.0|my daughter plays this, I can't even get very far on the regular temple run, but she seems to enjoy it..great for kindle fire!
B005LJITS0|1.0|This movie offers nothing in terms of originality, compelling story, or any redeeming quality of any sort. Do not watch this movie sober if you are over the age of 12. Very cartoon-y special effects to boot.
1935597760|5.0|Had read the book before and lost my copy.  Not only is it a great book, but it came promptly and in good condition.  I donated it to our local library
B0031RS2HC|5.0|An excellent action and crime novel for the reader who likes to escape from reality for a period of time. A well written and constructed story that will hold the reader's interest beyond midnight.
B001KZG99A|5.0|its the first time I have seen it and can't wait to watch the second and third movie in the set
B00CL68RLU|4.0|I waited until I had view all the episodes before setting out to write a review. I did love the entire series. I will say though some of the plot turns were crazy and the FBI sometimes behaved as would the keystone cops. The most interesting thing in this show is the characters. The story line can be way out their but like Joe Carrol says \\"we need Charactors the audience can invest in\\" and love and hate for a story to be well liked. This show did that more than any other I have watched on TV in a long time. Kevin Bacon is an incredible actor and was before this show came along so that was not surprising he was the best in this show. James Purfoy's acting was quite surprising and I would gauge he should be up for many awards come award time. I would recommend this show to anyone who likes criminal minds, CSI, or law and order. It is an emotional ride that doesn't end til the last show and then when you think alls well that ends well- they get'cha again. I do hope that they will bring this show back next season.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was very good, with lots of twists and turns. Didn't know what would happen next. I think that the first book is better, though. At the end of the book, the last sentence makes your mind filed with questions. It made me want to read the 3rd one.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|It was okay. Toooo long, very unrealistic beginning and old lady's death was not dramatic enough. Not in the top 10 of Bond movies.
B0054OGQS2|5.0|Has got to be one of my favorite films ever. If you can stomach the brutality. You will love the story.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I don't often purchase DVD's.  I am glad I made the exception with this one.  Like many, I am a real 'Bond fan'.  I have found Bond films of late to be a disappointment.  I don't think I have been alone in this sentiment.  Enter this film with a good plot, good acting, great filming and music from Adele---- how could it possibly disapoint???
B005NFVZTM|4.0|A fun movie! The original X Men and X Men First Class are my two favorites in the series.  I like the fact that Jennifer Lawrence<br />(of Hunger Games) stars in this movie.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I got this because my Beyerdynamic DT-770 LE 32 ohm headphones were having some problems being driven from my Laptop and my iPhone and no amount of eq on either of the devices could fix. Both would distort before the drivers in the headphones got anywhere near enough power. So I bought this and the clarity increased ten-fold and it really helped even out the sound and got the drivers moving the way they should.  The amp is really clean but it is not very loud so if you have higher impedance headphones just take note that it will move the drivers better and increase clarity but may not make them that much louder. if you have lower impedance headphones like below 32ohms or super high impedance like 600ohms and above I wouldn't buy this, low impedance headphones don't gain much from this and the eq settings on this can be achieved just fine on any other mobile device and for super high impedance headphones I can pretty much tell you your probably gonna need a bigger amp to get those working right.
B000K7VHJQ|5.0|This is a good movie to have for my collection.  It is well done, moving and very motivational.  It is bloody in scenes,  very realistic.  This is a really great movie no matter how many times you watch it.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love building games and Nemo and this is the best of both worlds. All much fun and I love it. :)
B0068THAGY|3.0|I was disappointed in the movie. It seems like it was more of a child's movie, although that was not how I remembered it being marketed. I hope J.J. Abrams does a better job with Star Wars than he did with this. I would definitely recommend this for children.
B000001ELR|4.0|If you're a Kiss fan, you're going to love Creatures of the Night.  By far not their best and brightest work, but it's Kiss, and it has good some stuff on it.  Destroyer is my favorite, but I'm enjoying Creatures too.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I should have seen the twist coming, but didn't!  A great story with good characters.  This is story telling at its best.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|If you are into video's this is for you. Watch whatever video's you want that they have listed. Enjoy it
B006Z9K97E|4.0|the book kept me interested, I was anxious to find out how he managed to escape and how he settled in to his new world.<br />however I would have liked to have got more detail. the book moved very quickly through the years.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|This sequel to Ender's Game is an interesting story.  The author intertwines a good story, with well developed characters and an interesting twist, with some thought provoking themes.  He discusses what it means to be human, and our xenophobic nature.  There is a lot to think about in this book along with a &#34;can't put it down&#34; story line.  I did think it went a little long, but that was fine, as I think it was necessary to make the point the author wanted to.  Definitely suggest you read this.
B001EC3JME|5.0|This holster is very durable and lightweight, it also protects. The built in swivel feature helps in tight places. Buy it!
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|I started doing the Fast Diet a few weeks ago.  I haven't dropped a lot of weight but my weight is slowly going down.  I find it easy to do so will stick with it and see how it goes after more than a few weeks and see if some of the benefits will kick in.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|WATCH THIS MINI SERIES!<br />I totally understand why the BBC's website has technical difficulty after the first episode aired... this show is engaging, addicting... once you start watching you'll feel a need to keep watch.<br />Check it out!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Good job to HBO! Can't wait to view the third year, an enjoying this greatly. HBO has some great movies sometimes.
B008602KQI|5.0|They did a great job with this movie. Usually when you watch a movie after reading the book, there is some disappointment in the depiction of characters or even change in the plot. This was spot on and I can't wait to see Catching Fire!
B002ZG975Q|4.0|THE movie is obviously a remake of beauty and the beast so if you liked that movie you will enjoy this. A little forced in places but otherwise it was good, the supporting cast kind of steals the show for me.<br />if you are like me, a sucker for romance then this is a movie for you!
B00701L5XS|5.0|Need extra practice at easy knots? Get the app! Need extra practice at hard knots get the app! Just a great app! 3D views and motion etc.<br />I rate it 5 stars just get this app!!!!
B00APUYN0I|5.0|This is a movie that I want to purchase so I can watch it again and again! After watching for the first time, my husband and I wanted to restart it right then!
B004DK5CYM|5.0|great movie, fun and interesting extras. I liked the interview with the real Penny, the woman who believe that Secretariat would be Secretariat<br />cannot go wrong with blu ray.<br />it is a great feel good movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I believe the product has great quality and awesome graphics. And we can forget how addicting it is, when I first got the game I could put it down-<br />! That's how amazing it is!Download it!!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I have loved this show from the start. I love the ongoing romantic tension and mystery solving in this show.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|very interesting story. author can get into very detailed description and keep it interesting. much research is evident. reminds me of my other favorite, barbara tuchman.
B00B2G4O2G|4.0|If this show doesnt surprise you at least once per episode, you probably should be writing it.  Kevin Bacon does a great job playing the tough but vulnerable character, though sometimes he isnt vulnerable enough.  James Purefoy plays the intellectual villain better than anyone since Hopkins did Hannibal Lecter.  Other actors do a decent job as well....especially Natalie Zea, whose talents are often upstaged on Justified.  Check it out!
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Not usually a fan of books to movies, particularly movies from epic stories such as Life of Pi.  But Ang Lee does not disappoint.  There is no better director at presenting emotions and atmosphere.  He diligently studies the environment he is re-creating and does an excellent job of present the sense of the moment, culturally as well as the empirical environment.  Worth watching.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great show. I like the characters and it keeps me interested. There hasn't been a tv show that has been able to do that for me for a long time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesomely fun. You HAVE to play. It is easy. It is like Temple Run. Please try it!
B006MW3UZW|4.0|The developing characters continue and oh how this family enjoys following the progress.  Despite anachronisms here and there, this is a most enjoyable series with a nod to the historical.  One of the finer series for its writing, production values and acting.  Look forward to the following seasons.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Wasn't sure if I would like this book, but the more you read you don't want to stop. Not what I expected for ending...it was affirming in these unseen.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Really fun game, lots of different games and objectives. Play up to four cards, chat with friends, or play some slots. Glad it's finally on kindle so I can play away from home, too.
B004W2V254|5.0|The movie was spellbinding. Even thought I thought I knew the ending. I was hopeful for a different outcome. Everything about this movie was great.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Thank you Mr. Jordan and Mr. Sanderson.  You have given me countless hours of swimming through my imagination and itno yours.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I was very excited to start watching this show when I started to see the previews for it. Well it definitely did not disappoint! It kept me on the edge of my seat every episode and was such a good story line! I cannot wait for the next season!
B00881PTRC|1.0|Nothing anyone hasn't seen. I played roughly ten games and in that short time it repeated the same words three times.
3832797033|4.0|As essentially a \\"picture book,\\" the title really does well here. Just over 300 pages long, each one a glossy full color page containing a full spread of a picture. The pictures themselves are stunning, both in printing and photographing - great color, saturation, framing, and overall composition. Paper weight is substantial, making the piece more of a coffee table book than something you'd sit in bed with. Somewhat chronologically arranged, starting with the earliest models, and moving through in chapters according to \\"erras,\\" some of which overlap in years, to the modern day variants. Almost all pictures contain years and model designations, with some showcasing brief model specifications, such as engine, transmission, production, etc. The break in pages on the two-page spreads somewhat detracts from the viewing, but not much you can really do with that.<br /><br />The text is really the low point of the book for me. What little text there is present is repeated in several languages, throughout most of the book. A short forward, and a small paragraph introducing each chapter is essentially the only information provided. No details on the history of each model, particular artwork / branding of the car, etc. Just a year, model, and a few sentences on what the particular era the chapter is based around. I understand providing a history lesson wasn't the main purpose of this book, but it would still have been nice to have a little background to accompany the stunning photographs.<br /><br />Overall rather happy with the purchase; worth the price in my opinion. Definitely a book that will actually get picked up and flipped through for some time to come, and not just collect dust on some shelf. Great to show someone the progression of the brand, or as a conversation piece with company.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A reflection of the fears and questions we have regarding the direction and values being processed in our children's minds.  This story covers denial, interventions, hope and an ongoing attempt we make to help and know our children.  A wonderful  insightful, heart tugging story.
B0086700CM|3.0|What can I say, you either love the game or hate it!  I installed the app and still haven't played the game.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|Haven episodes with no commercials...not a single one&#62; My wife and I love the convenience of this DVD package. As followers know, this show can get deep at times and following can be difficult if time lapses between seasons. So the DVD's give up the &#34;instant replay&#34; capability when needed. And some we just enjoy watching over and over again.
B008NEVP1S|4.0|Best in several albums, very consistent, great songs and more excellent guests.  It's not Bachelor or Magnolia, but a fine album.
B001AQR39O|1.0|DVD COULD ONLY PLAYED ON COMPUTER, NOT ABLE TO PLAY ON DVD PLAYER THE DISC IS JUNK!!!  WILL NEVER USE THIS SHIPPER AGAIN.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|bought this as a gift for my fiance who is a big Dr who fan.  its a great pen. very nice and different
0470449764|3.0|Pros: Lot of questions to practice.<br /><br />Cons: After one use, the book is of no use (If you have marked answers with pen/pencil)<br /><br />Better to buy a good used book for less.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am hooked! This series is great and I love to watch the next episode without waiting till next week!
0470449756|2.0|Once you are done with the questions, the book is redundant. Some questions are repeated from the GMAT Premier 2013.<br /><br />Its a one time use workbook, which is very expensive for the content it has.
B00BZAYZ82|5.0|I'll Admit, THe First Hour Of This Movie Moves Pretty Slowly. Once it Picks Up, However, I See Why This Movie Is Considered Such A Classic. For Once, It seems, A Movie Displays The Germans During WWII Not As Simple Evil Bad Guys, But Shows Them As Human beings. Great Submarine Movie, Great War Movie, Great movie All Around. Again, It Takes An Hour To Get Really Interesting, But Once It Does It Never Stops.
B007NG93CK|5.0|This book keeps you gripped.from beginning to end!! A big fun of Reichs and I declare this my best read so far
B00BL5YQKS|4.0|This Show Has Been Very Entertaining To Watch So Far, And I'm Only 5 Or 6 Episodes In. I Really Wish CC Was Supported For This Show, As I Prefer To Have It On, But The Quality Of The Show More Than Makes Up For It! Plan To Keep Watching.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|This is a pretty good action flick. Anyone needing a bump-up in heart rate should take a dose of this one!<br />I won't pretend to be one of those smarty-pants types that knows all about how a movie should be made and honestly I wouldn't know a &#34;Jeremy Renner&#34; from a truck fender but for me this feature delivers some pretty serious bang for the buck.<br />My wife and I enjoyed it.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Works quickly and has a fairly good interface.  The only problem I have is sometimes the controls freeze when in map mode, otherwise works well.
B00AYB1RGG|1.0|This movie is awful, and not in an ironic way. It's just plain awful. I sat through the entire thing thinking, &#34;Maybe it will get better. Maybe there is an amazing twist at the end.&#34; There isn't.
B00005JSGK|4.0|the movie was in great shape clear and had great sound the dvd was in great shape just like new very happy with it.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|I love this stylus- I use my iPad for taking notes on the screen and this stylus is the smoothest one I've tried- it really glides across the screen. The large size works remarkably well, too- it somehow makes my screen-writing much much more steady and even.<br /><br />I had a small issue with the rubber tip, and when I sent the company (Studio Neat) an email, they responded in 3 minutes (!!!) to say that they would send me another tip right away!<br /><br />So, the product is great, it's from a small business with great customer service, and it's made in the USA.
B000O599ZS|4.0|Good storyline, excellent photography with John Waynes's usual excellent portrayal of the character.  The location contributed very much to the overall story.
B0015442YU|5.0|Great Movie! Please watch the trilogy. Anthony Hopkins performance is terrific. I would recommend this movie to all that love suspense!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Beautifully presented, great story, made for children but thoroughly enjoyed by adults.  Was glad to see the interaction of a teen and her mom..
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show has such great acting that it feels like a short film every time you watch an episode. Must see!
1400069807|5.0|This book has everything nonfiction should have.  It is well written, very readable, well organized, well documented and so interesting.<br />I have always been interested and informed about what is in our food.  I was always a label reader and since I became intolerant of fructose and I have to look out for High Fructose Corn Syrup every where.<br /><br />What I really like about this book is that Moss hasn't written a detailed indictment of the food industry.  Instead, this is a methodically researched history of how the food industry formed us into sugar, salt and fat addicts.<br /><br />Much of the history was told through telling about the chemists who did the research.  My husband and I were both employed in the chemical industry although not the food industry.  These were bench chemists doing the bidding of their bosses who were leading the research to satisfy the CEO's and the boards of directors whose goal is to obtain as much wealth as possible for themselves.  So, quietly without just saying we were led to be addicted to processed food, Moss tells how it happened from the point of view of the front line employees.<br /><br />An example is Al Clausi, who spent his career working for General Food, now Kraft Foods.  One of the first assignments he had was to develop instant pudding.  At first he was told to research natural products to thicken the milk.  Later after a competitor used a chemical to do the job, Clausi was ordered to study chemicals that would thicken the milk.  I guess I had never thought about why instant pudding works but it was fascinating to me to read the story of how it was invented.<br /><br />There is a lot of discussion in the book about the bliss point.  Research was done to find the point at which the sweetened product creates the most satisfaction.  Even better was to find the point where sugar and salt are at their bliss points.  Think candy bars with salty nuts in them.  And finally there is fat.  It is harder to pinpoint the bliss point for fat, but it is definitely better for the food companies to see if they can really combine the fat, sugar and salt in a product that makes it virtually impossible for certain people to stop eating it when they start.<br /><br />I think about the trend towards putting bacon in desserts.  I hear this discussed on tv cooking shows.  After reading this book I clearly see what is happening.  The food industry pushes their buddies in the big entertainment networks to push foods that have it all sugar, salt and fat.<br /><br />One of the really frightening things to me is the subject of cheese.  I always think of cheese as a dairy product and it is, but it is loaded with salt and fat so I try to refrain from eating too much...but who doesn't love a salty, fat loaded pizza with a nice sweet tomato sauce and a slightly sweetened crust.<br /><br />I must add as a personal note that since I was diagnosed with fructose intolerance, I must avoid cool whip. While a number of companies have recently removed high fructose corn syrup from their products, (thank you Yoplait).  I am shocked at how often restaurants use cool whip in all kinds of desserts.  I was recently on a cruise and I asked the pastry chef if they used any cool whip.  She grinned really big and said \\"No cool whip on board mam\\"<br /><br />I think of myself as a healthy eater, but reading this book I realize I am addicted to certain food combinations that have been developed to satisfy my cravings.  Ice cream with nuts, dark chocolate with nuts, fruit with whipped cream and a little bit of shredded cheese on my salad, oh yes along with oil and vinegar dressing with salty soy sauce.<br /><br />Read this book and you will see where you personally are vulnerable to the big industrial food giants and how they manipulate everything on the shelf at the store.ss point for fat, but it is definitely better for the food companies to see if they can really combine the fat, sugar and salt in a product that makes it virtually impossible for certain people to stop eating it when they start.<br /><br />I think about the trend towards putting bacon in desserts.

B00B2G4O2G|5.0|This show will have you on the edge of your seat! Great acting and a thrilling twisted storyline that will leave you wanting more.
B005XN31LY|5.0|Once I started watching the series, I wanted to keep going to the next one. Originally, I thought it would be juvenile. One of my students requested that I view and I was not disappointed.  Very clever in how fairy tales are utilized. I would like to finish season one as soon as possible. How I wish it did not cost me money :)
1401929281|5.0|Theta Healing is truly an amazing technique. It is just really fast. I've tried many other techniques, which healed really quickly but theta healing is still my number 1. Trough this book I let go of so much... So much beliefs about self love and negative view about the world.<br />I bought it purely for my own self growth, but now I'm planning to become a theta practitioner myself. It truly changed my life.<br />I don't know why Theta Healing is said to be a scam by a lot of people... If you've done Theta Healing once you know it's absolutely lnot a scam.
0316069884|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a co-worker after having a conversation about food standards in america.  Talk about an eye opening read that will make you second guess every chicken breast and pork chop you eat in the future.  If you even remotely care about what you eat or the treatment of farm animals this book is for you.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I was not sure when I first starting reading because I never read a book that was all letters back and forth between the characters.  What a great surprise to find that the author was able to reveal the interesting personalities of the characters in a very special manner that leads you to feel that you would like to meet them personally.  My friend recommended this book and I'm very happy that I took the recommendation.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|A friend gave me season one and I was hooked by the first 10 minutes, yes 10 minutes. I could not wait for her to give me season two so I ordered both two and three. I go to bed at least by nine o'clock every night but I was so hooked on this series I was watching  it in bed on a portable DVD player EVERY night until 1:a.m. until it was over. I cannot wait until season four but I don't know if I can wait week to week so I may record it and watch it all at once. One of the best series I have ever seen. Love it, love it loved it.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|With help from his wife whom he seems to completely adore, as he should, Tom has wrote an amazing record. Sadly, with todays age and mainstream media this record will be overlooked or pushed under the rug. This record is very good perhaps even great. You have to appreciate what Tom has done here as he has had vocal surgery and was told by many not to sing or that he wouldn't ever sing as good as he once did. He proved them all wrong with this release. He has been working hard for ten years to put together a real record of hits not just one hit and the rest fillers like many today seem to do. Tom Keifer's record has blues, rock, and perhaps even a subtle hint of country. He dedicated and wrote a song entirely for his wife, who also helped Tom write some of these songs on here.<br />  Cold Day In Hell, is probably the biggest CLASSIC ROCK/Cinderella like song on here. Ask me Yesterday, is a hit also ,as it is a softer side to Tom and just has a good flow to it. The Flower Song, reminds me of a Mick Jagger/Rolling Stones song and that isn't a bad thing. It may not be Cinderella but it's very good and Keifer pretty much WAS Cinderella, not to discredit the band in anyway though. Thumbs up Mr. Keifer.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Such an adventure! Very exciting, romantic, and thrilling. So much happens to Ethan and Lena's relationship, and surprisingly Ridley and Link meet again as well. In the second book of the caster chronicles, a new dark power has been introduced besides Sarafine, and Ethan and his friends need to stop it. The author leaves you will an intriguing cliffhanger, leaving you wondering what will happen next.

B004XANKVO|5.0|This back pack far surpasses any pack you'll find in quality of materials, efficiency in design, and attention to seemingly every detail in making a near perfect back pack that will meet nearly, if not all, needs the buyer has. If you commute to work on a bike, the pack will carry everything you need to make it through your day at work: shoes, pants, shirt, lunch, bottled drinks, pens, sunglasses, computer and tablet, etc. There is a place for everything and everything in its place. The pack was thought out thoroughly by the engineers and designers at THULE and covers every detail and more. The weight is perfectly distributed so that it seems you are not carrying nearly as much weight that is really in it. Adjust the length of the shoulder straps slightly from out of the box when you receive the pack when riding your bike, particularly, because the top of the pack will dig into your neck if the straps are too short (dependent on person's size). The pack is very firm on the backing and straps and has solid build construction. Comfort is attained by simply loosening the shoulder straps as they are very stiff and narrow on my body type and by loosening (lengthening) them the straps will widen out, putting less pressure on your body at the edges of the straps, particularly.<br />Besides simply adjusting the shoulder straps for better comfort, especially when cycling, the pack is perfect and has no defects. The quality is far superior to anything I've purchased in the past. I was tired of continually replacing back packs about every 2 years because of poor construction and this one seems built to last nearly a lifetime, I hope, as the 25 year warranty assures. I have previous customer loyalty and high expectations of anything THULE, as their bike racks are precision engineered and indestructible in build quality and materials.<br />I am also a college student and I wasn't looking for a back pack particularly for school supplies alone, but the big picture, even more practical and versatile and cost efficient, for the future, cause I'm only in school for a few more years. I'm going to be working and traveling at times for the rest of my life, and this pack suits my future perfectly, an investment well spent!!!
B0036T31YY|1.0|After watching the review, this sure looked like a horror movie to me - but it's not. It tricked me the same way \\"Tall Man\\" with Jessica Biel did. Horror type trailer, stupid movie.<br /><br />This MUST have been made by film students because it's got that air of pretentiousness and smug \\"we're awesome\\" feeling that comes when you know something well enough to be dangerous with it, but before you've mastered enough to know you don't know anything and have barely scratched the surface of your art.<br /><br />I appreciate the review that tries to explain this as a deal with death, and a sort of analogue to Sisyphus. That doesn't really pan out though when you examine the choices made by the character. If indeed she has the knowledge of prior events, then she's been through the loop before. But her seeming shock and learning all of these things, as if for the first time, tells us that this can't be true. If death is indeed trying to reclaim her, death got it's deal fulfilled already - because she didn't make it out alive or she would know the details of what's going on. For death to then stick her in a Sisyphus type situation but without the knowledge leads to no punishment. So I don't buy that explanation - even though it's a valiant effort.<br /><br />In the end, this is just film students who got some money based on a pretty solid idea and story device. They didn't know what they had though, and executed poorly in trying to fill out the rest of the run time.<br /><br />Sadly this movie isn't even worth the buck that RedBox would charge you.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is definitely one of those books that you pick up ,and never want to put down.<br />It's just amazing .
B004VMUS9G|4.0|A very reliable app. I like it a lot because you can change your settings and stuff. What I don't get is that they only advertize their own stuff, but I just ignore it anyway. Great app! You should get it.
081299471X|5.0|I don't understand why it took American publishers so long to understand that Mitchell's books deserve to kept on the shelf in a manner thaat they may be re-read and loaned out, but I'm glad Modern Library finally figured it out.
B004DH76LW|5.0|This is the original film, and there can never be anything like it.  I saw it when I was very small and have seen it off and on ever since.  It grounds me to see it.  It is after all these years still incomparable.

B00BUCW54Q|1.0|A five-foot seven inch 170lb weakling tries to play Reacher who is six-five and weighs 220 (in the book series). Cruise would have been better as the shooter. He'd be dead half-way through the picture.

B001FVV2X2|5.0|One of my favorite shows of all time.  I have watched the series many times!  OMG, 5 more words required.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This is literally nonstop action. I could barely put it down; it was read in a mere three nights.Obviously not your typical Wheel of Time book, but many suprising climaxes came to make the Last Battle.
159420411X|4.0|Easy to read and understand but it really gives you a good understanding of predictions, statistics and use of data.<br />I liked it.
B001LX2J22|5.0|We actually wanted to give this movie 4.25 stars but there was no way to apparently do that.<br />Anyhow, if you love the Hannibal legacy (as we definitely do) starting w/Silence of the Lambs all the way up to the current NBC show, &#34;Hannibal&#34; (Amber: &#34;which is totally awesome&#34;).  Yes, Amber has a massive high school crush on Will and even on Mads (who plays Hannibal).  (Jen: What the hell. Dude be old enough to be yo grandpa, ewww!)...I personally can't help but, think of him smashing poor Daniel Craig's man parts as Lateef or LaSheef in the James Bond flick (& my fav new James Bond one at that)...Casino Royale.  (Amber: Whatevs...!!!)  Amber can like who she likes so, she just proclaimed and as for all you fans of Hannibal...you really can't not like this one (yes, I know that was a double negative)... since it gives you the back story for Will Graham, et. al.<br /><br />For those of you that are rabid fans of the NBC show then you REALLY NEED TO WATCH THIS ONE if you haven't yet...you will learn so much but, there's no spoilers that we caught.<br />J&A

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this app.  It is so easy to use with an intuitive design.  Having the ability to look back at what calculations have been done is wonderful. If you are interrupted you have the ability to look at your past calculations, touch where you want to pick up and begin at that point.  Absolutely wonderful.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Smooth graphics and puzzles that hold my interest.  Dev seems to add new levels every few months or so.  Great game!
B0092MJOMW|5.0|This album was released in 1986.. for that time this was the ultimate thrash album ever made and still to this date is one of the greatest. Slayer is one of my favorites and always will be. Any Slayer fan knows this is a must have for the music collection.

1468179993|2.0|I was a bit surprised when I realized that this book was simply a written account of a man that has watched and studied multiple TED talks. Although he does pull out some of the big ideas that are found within some of the best TED talks, there is little originality in this book. I found the writing to be slow and read more like a college term paper than a motivational book. I would suggest that people considering buying this book would be better off watching a few more TED videos with their time.

B000AMJC2K|5.0|All you need is an Allen wrench. It takes about 20 minutes to get into position (the connection closest to the base is extremely inaccessible) but it has held flawlessly for quite a while now. Also has a rather long reach and looks quite stylish. The price is something I really liked about it as well. If you're looking for a monitor arm, this is definitely the way to go!

B006LSZECO|5.0|For the first hundred pages I was wondering where this book was going and then it slaps you in the face.  The twists and turns that you begin to realize are happening keep you turning the pages at a feverish pace.  I found a new favorite author to follow.
0316069434|5.0|My favorite author and my favorite detective..what more could I ask for! Just the very best...added to my collection of Harry Bosch
076781326X|5.0|Story was great - not exactly as in the book but very enjoyable. Found the quality to be fine. Worth the price!
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|I like the Friday Night Frights; my daughter liked the Why Do Ghouls Fall in Love?.  The skating one was awesome, but I skate so maybe I'm biased. The other one seemed just like silly teen drama to me, but it's still cute in it's own right.  It was nice they released both of them on one DVD.  They could have released them separately.  Everyone was happy.
1476719071|2.0|I don't even know where to start with this book. I was lured by all the 5-star reviews that I finaly gave in to all the hype. The book is not cheap either so imagine my disappointment when the book turned out to be a complete disaster.<br />First, the characters are so one-dimentional and bland to say the least. Abby has no unique traits or qualities that would make all the men in the book go after her. She's a self-proclaimed \\"undecided\\" in about every aspect of her life. Like the others say, she's practically a blank canvass that others can project themselves on to. She isn't a Bella though, Abby is a bit more rational than that, which is probably her only redeeming quality. Even though I can't wrap my head around sleeping on the same bed with the person I'm trying not to fall in love with, but hey, it's a story, I guess it COULD happen. Travis' character is overdone, I don't think this guy is human. He's naturally a straight-A student, and apparently, naturally hot, without having to do anything. If only the world works that way. And all the women dropping their panties for him? Where do these people go to school? Slut University? And what about the \\"I only bag them on the couch\\" thing? Just plain stupid. His cousin must be really cool to put up with that, either that or he doesn't have any balls to stand up to him. Just another stupid character.<br />Overall, this book just didn't work for me. I found myself skipping through a lot of pages, trying to get to the good parts, which never came. There was nothing swoon worthy that ever happened, nothing stirred my emotions, and the sex scenes are as boring as the characters themselves. No passion, no sparks, just drop your panties and let's get it on.<br />I really wanted to like Travis, he had the formula for a great book boyfriend-hot, smart, and a fighter. But somehow, between being a man-whore and his non-existent charm, he just fell short. He's not an alpha, he's a manipulative brat.
0802473156|4.0|I found the book very helpful for relationship reasons.  Though somewhat simplistic, it helps develop insight and clarity.  I recommended it to my lover so that we can be on the same page.
B008602KQI|5.0|What a awesome book and movie! I can't wait to watch it again, and I can't wait for the new movie to come out!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I like this app. I travel a lot and my Kindle is always there with me when I turn out the light to sleep. Beyond what my Kindle already does (and does extremely well), what more logical use than to function as a bedside clock/alarm. The settings are easy to use and the alarm is more than adequate to waken me.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Jodi Picoult has now become my favorite author. Her depth of characters grabs you at the beginning and the plot twists keep you engaged until the very end.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is just so great..<br />it is kinds educational too. you should really play this game bro. like for serious man
B007HC3LHS|5.0|You will not want to put this book down. Easily a real life situation that demands your attention. Congratulations Ms. Haynes!
1451613512|5.0|This book belongs on the shelves of anyone who has ever wondered why so many countries have a negative view of the United States. It follows the ideologies, events, institutions, corporations, and government entities from administration to administration to demonstrate how the powers that be manipulated public perception and caused irreparable harm on a global scale.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Very eerie.  A deep look at the life of a young girl kidnapped and held captive for many years. The relationship between the young girl, her captor, and their son. Must read.
B005EI86JU|3.0|Better than a number of the D7000 books I have read. I am not sure why I buy them they are roughly all around as interesting as the manual, and they almost always insert a particular view point which is rarely family photos and macro photography. If you understand the basics of photography and can handle reading a Nikon manual ... save your money
B0048WQDIE|5.0|I enjoyed the book when it first came out.  Enjoyed the reread even more.<br />A must read for all! YES!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Never realized there is a dictionary of flower names. Showed survival,determination, love and hate. The foster care system isn't perfect and how kids fall through the cracks.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|It works great on the Droid 4 and Kindle Fire and kindle fire HD.<br />It has replace my alarm clock.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Makes me smile whenever I listen to it! The music is beautiful and its refreshing to hear a classical instrument with such a modern twist.
0393088774|5.0|I read this with a group, so we discussed each chapter thoroughly. It was a real experience, and I learned a lot.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|A must read for fans of the series. I couldn't put the book down after I started. It was a mystery until the last page.
0385342071|5.0|I embarrassed myself at work by spitting out a mouthful of chocolate milk all over the staffroom table while reading this book.  The good news is, I was too amused by this story to be properly embarrassed.  I have been a fan of this author for some time.  I thought Can You Keep A Secret was her best, but this one is so much better.  It is so funny, and the characters are so much fun.  I also like that it is a clean book, with no sex.  That's a nice change.  Definitely a keeper.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Touching and funny! Would highly recommend to any of my more liberal friends. Lots of Helen Hunt nude scenes, so definitely not appropriate for all ages.
B004047XXO|2.0|we could not watch it because  we use digital 3d .analog is on the way out.a bit misleading.should have retuned it.
B00932A4XE|5.0|Great cast of characters. Very funny! Chris Rock, Jennifer Lopez and Chris Rock are hilarious!  Definitely a must see with significant other!
B001AEF6BI|5.0|This is a classic, in a way.  The characters you definitely can relate to...even though it is in the 1980s.  The feelings are the same...only the music and some clothes are different.  I think my son's high school is LESS modern looking...ha, ha.
B005OUARUO|5.0|Love the album! Favorite song so far is cicada and gulls.<br />Bittersweet melodies is another favorite. I recommend this album<br />Whole heartedly.
B0019DU82W|3.0|Case was broken in pieces when it came but CD was fine...not happy about the case & I paid more on here than I would have at best buy.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Awesome Product protects my phones very well.  I will recommend this Item to all of my friends and Relatives. Thanks
B002XTBE6K|1.0|Saw Emma on OTA TV NPR some time ago.  Excellent video on HD 1080p.  Wife liked the story, I liked the visuals.<br />I thought that since this was on a DVD the quality would be AT LEAST as good but I was disappointed.<br />Not so. The LOW DVD quality took greatly away from the experience.  Returned it.  If you are expecting HD don't.  At least not on the version I received.  Some say we are getting spoiled watching today's higher quality media but I say we have suffered long enough with poor quality.  America has been behind in HD availability for years.  Isn't it time media companies catch up even if it means multi-DVD sets.  At least offer it.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Wonderful read.  Looking forward to the third part. Great story telling.  Not predictable.  This will be the next epic HBO series.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing this game everyday. It has become very habit forming as I really enjoy talking to people all over the world.
0736092269|4.0|This is a really detailed strength training book that breaks every muscle group and exerscise down! I need to make I read each exercise carefully to be sure to really understand each exercise.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Another in a long line of thrillers. The reader is kept in total darkness until the very end of the story who the assassins are.<br />This is a must read book by David Baldacci. You will not be disappointed.
B009R659L8|3.0|I love Mary Higgins Clark's books and read them the minute they are available. This was my least favorite of her books. There was no depth and no excitement for me. Interesting story and lots of characters to figure out.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i chose this rating because it was truly indescribable all though i think katnisss should of told peeta how she trully absolutely felt
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Very entertaining. I can't wait for the next season.  The acting is incredible as well as the scenery. So glad I was able to obtain thru Amazon
0143116177|5.0|This is an amazing travel through history.<br /><br />Is like been at the classroom again.<br /><br />I am reading a chapter and then go back and do it again making my own notes on the margins.<br /><br />I am really enjoying it.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Colorful tiles and fun challenges. The games start out easy and grow progressively more difficult.  The towers vary enough to keep me interested and looking forward to the next game.  The choice of a timed mode allows for a more experienced player to compete against the clock.  Love this mahjong!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I was skeptical when I first heard of the first one, but I ended up loving it! Now they came back with a better one!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Well done show.  I wish the show was being produced when I was in college because I think I might have become a lawyer.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|If you have watched any Downton Abbey, you know the answer to this question. If you have not watched, do yourself a favor and start with Season 1 Episode 1 and be prepared to care deeply and be thoroughly entertained.
B00BZOFUI2|3.0|First off, let it be clear that I am first and foremost a Ritchie Blackmore fan. So you can take my review with a grain of salt.<br /><br />It's somewhat hard to believe that this album is coming 8 years after Rapture of the Deep. Eight years and that's the best that Deep Purple can produce? Wow. It also didn't help that two weeks prior to the release I watched VH1's Behind The Music profile of Deep Purple where they mentioned the new album. Gillan boasted that this is the best sounding Deep Purple album ever (something he also said about The Battle Rages On back in the day, so it's kind of hard to take his word here). Paicey said that this is an album that the fans have been waiting for them to record for about 20 years now. My expectations were somewhat high.<br /><br />I really liked Purpendicular, Abandon had some good moments, Bananas was really good, but Rapture of the Deep was a bit stale. This new installment, Now What? is a mixture of all. I think there are some really strong songs (Uncommon Man, Weirdistan, Apres Vous), but I have a general complaint about the playing and production. It seems that ever since Ritchie left, the band has never really allowed Steve Morse to show his true skills too much. His solos tend to be a little on the short side (I really loved his playing on Sometimes I Feel Like Screaming), and his guitar is very low in the mix. It is certainly lower than Airey's organ, or Gillan's vocals. And that's the other thing - while I like Gillan's vocals on Weirdistan and Apres Vous, I don't particularly care for his singing on the rest of the songs. Why does this sound like Ian Gillan's Band? Why is his vocal so high in the mix? That has never been a defining characteristic of Deep Purple. David Coverdale made a similar mistake in the Restless Heart/Into The Light albums, when his ego of a rock god started creeping up, but he learned his lesson - in the recent albums, his vocals are mostly on par with the rest of the band. With Deep Purple, it's like the rest of the band quiets down when a verse starts so the audience can admire Gillan's \\"amazing\\" lyrics.<br /><br />I also don't particularly care for the jazzy-jams on the record. I miss the songs with the more driving rhythms (Any Fool Knows That, Perfect Strangers, Knocking At Your Backdoor). Yes, this is a different Deep Purple. Yes, Ritchie will never go back. But why does it take them 8 years to record something that can only be described as slightly above mediocre. Sorry guys - you need to reign in Gillan's ego a little bit and let Morse play a little more.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This situation and the events are generally believable.  The author does not know much about radio or diving.  A part of sci-fi is an understanding of technology that is largely missing here.  Still, it is a good story.
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|Adam Grant is a once in a generation talent. He clearly and concisely creates a model for human behavior that is both compelling and interesting. This book is a joy to read. I highly recommend it.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|I don't know why this was so badly reviewed while in theaters... to the point that I decided to wait until it was free to watch... I was pleasantly surprised by how enjoyable the movie was.  I put it on as \\"background noise\\" - think Lifetime movie - and it ended up grabbing my full attention.  The characters were the most enjoyable part.  Definitely worth watching.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|super show with an excellent cast, great and historically accurate storyline. I would strongly reccommend this entire series which I have only recently discovered, but will continue watching.
B00007E7K0|5.0|Great to have for a back up.  I have a feeling I will be losing or misplacing mine regularly.<br />Need to order more.
B003B02PEU|4.0|As always, John Grisham's work is terrific. He is my favorite author, and this book was as good as the others.
B00AQL8VU4|3.0|The search is quirky at best. I often find myself looking at my web browser on my tablet instead of using the app.
0385349831|3.0|I have followed and read works by Paulo Coelho for many years, and I have always loved his philosophy, spiritual writing, and fictional writing. However, I am disappointed in this particular book.<br /><br />This is a novel, and similar to some of his other works, it reads like it is real. This is not what I am concerned about. I love the set up of the book - a wise man from the year 1099 speaks with a group of people and his words come down to us now and still ring true. This is wonderful - we need these good words.<br /><br />However, if you have ever read Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet, you will recognize the work. Coelho's work is set up the same but with a different reason for the main character to be talking to a group. Just like Gibran's work, each chapter is on a particular topic covering love, marriage, children, giving, work, joy/sorrow and more. Likewise, Coelho's work is set up in similar chapters addressing similar topics (love, work, defeat, solitude, family and more). It disappoints me that a writer as great as Coehlo would write something so very, very similar to Gibran's work. If you have never read Gibran's book, you should read Coelho's. But if you have read Gibran, then don't read Coelho because you can't improve on perfection.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This is my first and probably only flashlight app. It's simple. I love the size, especially vs my iPhone and the color wheel offers a gazillion colors.<br />Plus it's free.
B004GGQMTW|5.0|You will watch this one over and over. Brilliant performances and exciting action overlying a sad truth. The ending is SO unexpected----but perfect
B00B22IJXK|1.0|So I guess it really isn't all that bad, but for my dollar there are much better free editors out there.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This is a \\"page turner\\" which I truly enjoyed reading. I had avoided this book thinking it would be trite , but it wasn't and it got me through a real rough cold!
B000XUBC5E|4.0|Entertaining. Good character development. Writer following a tried and true pattern without many surprises.Light reading with plot predictable for the reader.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book really ties everything up. After reading the epilogue Icried for two reasons. One because Of it being the end of the  hunger games. Two because they had children!!!!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Game of Thrones is a classic fantasy epic set in an alternate England in Arthurian times.  Think &#34;The Lord of the Rings&#34; meets &#34;War and Peace.&#34;
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|The graphics are wonderful and the animal selection is impressive. Love gameloft as a company because of these real time games. I jump between three or four for hours :)  thanks! 5stars+
B009S33I68|4.0|I waited a long time to hear Joe Galloway describe a cry of pain, too long.  That is why this rating is a &#34;4&#34; and not a &#34;5&#34;.  The movie is better than the book as a result.  I cheered the Major's wife taking those telegrams from the drivers of the Yellow Cabs; I cried when I learned that she passed away several months ago.  The ability to drown you with name rank and serial number wrapped around the most intense description of open warfare is Galloway's gift<br /><br />I thought of faces past, remembering what I cannot forget.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I am a huge LOA nut, I love Abraham, have been on 2 cruises with them. And even though I understand what LOA is, and believe it to the core of my being, I still struggle with manifesting. When I bought this book, I expected it to be like all the rest, nothing special. boy was I wrong! Pam is an incredible writer! She is funny, she is informed, and for the first time ever, I find myself wanting to write to the author of a book to express my gratitude for what they have written.<br />So, if you are still looking for ways to master this LOA thing, or even if you just want a new perspective, and a few good laughs, buy this fabulous book! For 2 bucks how can you go wrong? Now that I've read it, I can tell you it is worth so much more than that. I would have paid 10x that, or more!<br />Thank you Pam!
B004KKX814|5.0|Great toy. Kid loved it. Fast easy payment and shipping. Will buy again. Bought others just like this and they are all great. Thank you
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Good read! Kept me interested the whole time! Interesting story line, and great characters that stayed in my head all day waiting until I could get home to continue reading.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I like the product, but my only problem so far is that when I go to change the ringtone, I can find no way to listen to the ringtones before choosing them - maybe I'm just missing something, in which case, please inform me how to listen to the ringtones prior to choosing one for the alarm.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Despite Ewan MacGregor's perfectly couiffed hair in one scene, and a train wreck in the next, it was heartbreaking and heartwarming.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout video. I really saw changes in my endurance and body quickly and Jillian Michaels is really motivational without being too tough. It's also great that there are 3 different levels in just one DVD.
B009IA9OLE|1.0|Really dumb, hard to figure out, even on simple levels. Deleted it the same day. Do not buy very disappointing.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I was so disappointed in the ending, as much as I like Downton Abbey, I feel it has to much sorrow.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is good to have when you need to look up the weather.  The graphics are very good and clear.
B0086700CM|1.0|Difficult to use with no point that I can determine.  Used it a few times hoping to get the hang of it but not worth the effort.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|This app is good for searching or locating items in the dark in small and  enclosed areas.  Could be a little brighter.
0891419063|5.0|If you really want to understand what happen during these dark days that the \\"Greatest generation\\" was forged in, this is it. I have read 50 works from the real 300 to my own life in Desert Storm and Iraq 05-6 this one is the one to read, It is unlike anything you have ever been told or seen, told by the guy who walked the ground
B0017XD3OY|3.0|I hadn't watched this movie before. Of course Will Smith is awesome. I didn't enjoy the story line all that much. Not sorry I have it and may watch it again but it isn't one of my top choices at all.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Macklemore and Ryan Lewis are much more than most people know from the song Thrift Shop. They are great artists and this whole album proves that. I definitely recommend it.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|this watch fits me perfectly,<br /><br />its small face is made with quality, well everything here is made with quality<br /><br />people say it stops after awhile, well yes it does but its mechanical so spin it up a bit and it will work again, just not right away<br />so theres nothing wrong with this, people get scared when it didn't jump back into life when they pick it back up.  it doesn't work that way. you need to take it and thrash it around for about 30 seconds...then good as new<br /><br />one concern i have is that I can take the straps off<br /><br />I would like to clean the straps after the sweat has made it stinky but theres no pin hole i can access to remove the straps<br />now i probably have to clean the straps with the watch on it,<br /><br />is this watch water proof?  I'm not sure but I'd be pissed if i get water in to trying to clean the straps I should have been able to take off in the first place
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is fun because I like Lucy and it is challenging.  And I like the big huge fat Popo
B006PHD0RW|4.0|It's sorta like tetris! but it also takes into account the laws of physics! Lots of time wasted on this one.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|I loved this book. It reminded me of two books. Seth Godin's &#34;Linchpin&#34; which I liked, but I am not an employee type of guy. And Tim Ferriss' &#34;The Four Hour Work Week&#34; Which was also very good but left me feeling a little overwhelmed Chris gives you a simple, solid framework for lunching a business on a shoestring with example after quality example.
B000FC2L1Y|4.0|I am now reading the 5th of the series.  I am enjoying all of them, but like the first one  Outlander the best.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|No issues, works like a charm! I'm very satisfied with how this app runs. The user interface is easy enough to figure out.
B008LA7RM0|5.0|I have fond memories of this album as a kid but it strikes me in a completely different manner now.  I guess I can better appreciate the harmonic intricacies the Beach Boys are famous for.  Love it.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Too addictive and with the free option from Amazon it makes it more sweet. My 8 year old loves it.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I read this book on my ipad and highlighted so many passages such as:<br /><br />&#34;There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;It said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;When something evolves, everything around that thing evolves as well.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Don't give in to your fears...If you do, you won't be able to talk to your heart.&#34;<br /><br />This book is perfect if you're ready to put your life in perspective.  To follow your heart and not a the money trail.  Sometimes they can lead to the same place, but not if you're intention is to chase money.
B002LAM7PI|5.0|Scary for small kids but as long as they're old enough to understand it's not real it's a really fun movie!!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Finished reading last night around midnight.  Wanted to grab my torch and go for a run.  I read this after a recommendation from a friend.  Motivational indeed.  I only wish I had read it two months earlier as at 59 I am ruinning my first marathon this Sunday.  This was a great read for the first timer and set the stage mentally for an enjoyable experinece in Pittsburgh.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|We are huge fans of Quentin Tarantino and were not disappointed in the least bit.  This dialogue and amazing actors in this movie add to the already phenomenal script and directing.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|It was a good ending that we have all longed for, for so long, but unfortunately as compelling as it may be, and I definitely read through it in no time, you keep getting the feeling that it could have been so much better if Jordan himself got the chance to write it. The language was just not as intricate, and at times simplistic, some of the characters came off different than they were (just ever so slightly) and as much as Sanderson tries to capture the different point of views method of writing, it just isn't really it. The Genius just isn't there...

B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was amazing. The descriptions were so detailed you felt like you were there. A great piece of history and the story behind it.
0307476073|5.0|The author was vividly descriptive, bringing me onto the trail with her in her to small boots wearing the overly heavy back pack.  Each character she met was fully developed and brought to life.  I felt as if I grew along with her as she struggled along, coping with  weather, snakes, bulls and scary people overcoming each obstacle and meeting each challenge.

B003KGBISY|5.0|There are few directors who have had close to the lasting legacy that Japanese Akira Kurosawa has had.  There have been many excellent film directors who have had a great influence on other directors, TV, Films and pop culture like George A. Romero, Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick and Quentin Tarantion, but none has had the impact that Kurosawa has had on people, the media and pop culture and even these outstanding and influential directors were influenced by Kurosawa and his films and perhaps Kurosawa's greatest masterpiece and influential film is the Seven Samurai.<br /><br />The 1954 film is considered one of the most influential and best films on all time that has a lasting impact that has stood the test of time as well leaving an indelible mark on the entertainment world, but the film more than a excellently written story full of Samurai, action and drama as it deals with heavier topics than that as the Seven Samurai takes place in 1587 during the \\"Warring States Period\\".  Since before the Ōnin War (1467-1477) the Ashikaga Shogunate was in decline as Japan had erupted into a continuous civil war as lords fought for power.  By then 1587 Japan was in total chaos which caused the rise of ruthless warlords, bandits, wondering Ronin (Samurai warriors without masters) rape, pillaging, death and class conflict which Kurosawa showcases in the Seven Samurai.  The great script co-written by Kurosawa starts out in a small farming village in the mountains.  The citizens of the village learn of a band of bandits plan to raid their village when their harvest is complete later in the year and take all the harvest and food they had worked so hard on during the year.  Some of the villagers want to search for and hire some Ronin samurai, but others don't want outsiders like the samurai in the village and would rather appease the bandits, and even if they agreed to hire some samurai how could they pay them. The village was just some poor mountain farming village with nothing of real value to the likes of samurai.  The village elder Gisaku (Kokuten Kodo) makes a decision to hire some Ronin Samurai, but only to \\"find hungry samurai.\\" as the elder puts it.  A small group of villagers goes in search of some hungry samurai, but get turned away again and again at every village and town they travel to until they meet the samurai Kambei Shimada (Takashi Shimura) a veteran and battle hardened samurai.  It takes the villagers some time, but they manage to convince Shimada to help them and Shimada and the villagers go about recruiting other samurai for the mission.  Shimada brings together a rag tag team of five other samurai along with the wannabe Kikuchiyo (Toshiro Mifune).<br /><br />The samurai team and villagers travel back to their village, but are not hailed as heroes and saviors and instead looked upon with distrust and suspicion.  The villagers are wary of the samurai who they believe will eat what little foot they have left, sleep with their daughters and even take what they want like they bandits will who the villagers have hired the samurai to protect them from.  The situation quickly worsens when the samurai learn that the villagers have robbed and killed other wondering Ronin, but it is Kikuchiyo who understands the villagers plight and puts his comrades in place explaining that the villagers have suffered so many hardships because of the noble and warrior classes that the villagers have been forced to do what they have to survive.  Shimada and his fellow samurai come to a truce and begin to prepare for the coming raid of the bandits and through this begin to understand and even respect each other.  When the bandits come the samurai and villagers are ready as they battle each other for two days and nights until the samurai and villagers manage to defeat the bandits, but at a high price for the samurai, for only three have survived in Kambei Shimada, Katsushirō Okamoto (Isao Kimura) and Shichirōji (Daisuke Katō).  With their missioncomplete the three remaining samurai begin to leave the village with little or nothing to show for it and losing their friends and comrades, but Shimada and the three stop and look down at the village and the villagers who have gone back to their farming ways as if nothing has happened and then at the graves of their fallen comrades and says \\"Again we are defeated.  The winners are those farmers. Not us.\\"<br /><br />It is a fitting end to the Seven Samurai.  The story is beautifully written and put to film, but admittedly when I first saw the Seven Samurai on AMC at the age of fourteen I didn't understand or know exactly what was going on.  In school history classes didn't teach much about Japanese history outside of World War II, so all I had to go on was what I saw in films and anime.  Still that didn't keep me from falling in love with the film.  Who doesn't love samurai and a film about them along with action and killing?  That along with the story made this one of my favorite films of all time and eventually made the Seven Samurai the greatest film of all time or at least in my opinion.  With age came better knowledge and understanding of the film and the themes in it.  Kurosawa's story does an exceptional job of showing off the tumultuous time period in Japanese history and the class conflict that came to life because of it.  The lower class and poor felt betrayed, used and abandoned by the nobles and upper class of Japan as they used them for soldiers, taking their crops and taxing them with getting little or nothing in return yet Kurosawa's story also wonderfully display's their misconceptions on both the villagers and samurai's sides as well as showing both are human also.  The lasting legacy from the Seven Samurai story in that it is the first film and one of the first stories about bringing together a group of men or women for a mission, and films and filmmakers have been using that concept since in the likes of The Dirty Dozen, Ocean's Eleven, The Guns of Navarone, A Bugs Life, Ronin and countless others.  I guess I should point out a flaw with the story, which is extremely hard to find, but if there was one thing I could find is that the film is long at a running time of over three hours and methodically paced and I could see how some people might not like this style of filmmaking.  I guess that is a flaw for some, but it isn't for me as the length and pace of the film didn't bother me at all.<br /><br />While the story was excellent, it would not have been so good without the remarkable acting by the Japanese cast.  Takashi Shimura was outstanding as Kambei Shimada the wise leader as did Daisuke Katō who played Shichirōji another veteran samurai and Shimada's friend and lieutenant.  Katō easily showcased his wonderful acting ability especially at the end of the film when he figured out he the war torn and battle hardened samurai had survived while all his younger comrades had perished.  You could just tell from his display of emotion that he would have preferred to die in their place and to be honest I think he wanted to and maybe expected to die.  Keiko Tsushima does a splendid acting job as Shino the daughter of a villager who falls in love with Katsushirō (Isao Kimura).  Perhaps the backbone of the cast is Toshiro Mifune who played Kikuchiyo.  Kikuchiyo is a would be samurai from a common birth who dreams of coming a samurai.  Kikuchiyo is a lively and temperamental man who while wanting to become a samurai he also has come from the lower class and understands their plight.  Mifune brilliantly brings his character to life and is perhaps the best all-around character in the film and that is lofty praise since all the characters are well written and all the actors and actresses to a tremendous job in their roles.<br /><br />With his direction of the Seven Samurai, Akira Kurosawa demonstrates the epitome of filmmaking.  In the Seven Samurai Kurosawa shows growth is his directorial leadership, writing and organization from his earlier films such as Ikiru, The Quiet Duel and Rashomon.  Akira Kurosawa helped write a unique and original story demonstrated his craft and leadership as he brought the story, actors, music and cinematography together perfectly to create an artistic masterpiece.  With the Seven Samurai, Kurosawa truly put his stamp on filmmaking for generations to come.<br /><br />What more can be said about the Seven Samurai besides near that it is near perfection in filmmaking, but the Seven Samurai is more than that as it showcased a tumultuous Japan and the class conflict it brought with it along with an excellent and original story with compelling characters, beautiful cinematography and wonderfully choreographed action.  People were captivated by the samurai of Japan before the Seven Samurai, but with the Kurosawa's Seven Samurai the samurai and their way of life were brought to the eyes of the world and the growing film audience in the United States and around the world.  That is just one of many things that came out of the film along with the other points I talked about earlier, like the influence of the story as well as directing and filmmaking.  I know the Seven Samurai is one the most beloved films of all time, but for me it is the greatest film of all time, and if the Kurosawa had never made the film I don't think we would have films like Star Wars, The Dirty Dozen, The Wild Bunch and The 13th Warrior, or at very least they would be very different from the films we have today.  I without a doubt highly recommend the Seven Samurai, and is a must if you are a true fan of movies and the filmmaking process.of Navarone, A Bugs Life, Ronin and countless others.

B004N868DS|5.0|I look at my razer vespula, and I look back at the Roccat mousepad and wow so much difference in appearance. The razer vespula looks like a child's toy in comparison to the Alumic. It has a such a solid structure, like a rock, and both sides work well. it's nice and big which is plus for me. 40 bucks is steep for a mousepad, but I assure you that disappointment will never come to pass. I'm using my razer taipan on it and it seems to be doing great. When I used to remove the wrist pad from my vespula, the green rubbers that were attached to the ends of the mousepad were so terrible. No grip on them whatsoever. Every time I'd lift my hand up to adjust my mouse position, it would stick to my wrist and move out of place. Such flimsy construction. The Alumic, however, like I said before is like a rock. it does not move because of its nice weight, big size, and its aluminum structure. The rubber tips work like a charm. I just received the Alumic today though, so more time must be given, but overall great piece of hardware as of right now. Also, some people have complained about the wrist pad being to firm. I find it rather comfortable and providing great elevation for my wrist. Roccat makes great products. I advise you to take a chance with them!

B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a most masterful historically based production of a time when life was lived at a far slower pace than we do now.  Technology was in it's infancy and these characters are artfully cast and beautifully developed.  The dynamic between the aristocracy and the house staff and all their individual and collective lives is nothing short of brilliant. It makes you realize how starved we are are for rich productions that show us something other than the slick and shallow, not to mention reality TV.  Violet would be mortified.<br />Well Done!

B00B19DMUE|3.0|I saw the true story of the dubik box on SyFy's Paranormal Witness.  The true story was chilling enough.  They overdramatized it.  I guess they think they need to do this to make money at the box office.  I wish they had stuck to the true story of the college kids that bought the box on ebay and the experiences they had.

1451627297|4.0|11/22/63 is the best Stephen King novel that I have read in years.  I have been down on the master of horror in recent years.  His latest work has made me think that he has lost a little off his fastball.  Although this still isn't vintage King, it's still damn good.<br /> 11/22/63 is a time travel novel, which entirely leaves out any scientific explanation of how the time travel takes place.  There is just a random wormhole located in the back of a restaurant in Maine.  Going into the wormhole takes the traveler back to the same exact spot in 1958.  The owner of the restaurant had been going there to get cheap food supplies for his restaurant, but he had a bigger mission planned, one he passed down to the novel's protagonist, Jake Epping, a school teacher from Maine -- and that is to stop Lee Harvey Oswald from assassinating JFK.<br /> At over 750 pages, there is much more to the novel than just stopping the assassination.  In the process Jake also tries to save a man before his father kills his family and badly injures him.  He also settles into a town in Texas and works as a teacher, growing close to the people in the community and finding a love interest.  Despite the length of this novel, there is no point where it feels like it's dragging, a testimony to King's writing skill.  The novel has tension in the right spots, and King clearly did his research on the assassination of Kennedy.  I also enjoyed seeing how he represents the past.  It's almost like a living entity that is unwilling to change.  The one drawback is that this novel is heavy handed with King's political beliefs.  I don't read fiction to have the writer indulge me with his political agenda, something I frequently resented in this novel.  Otherwise I found it thoroughly enjoyable and worth reading.<br />Carl Alves - author of Blood Street

B00AOG6P86|4.0|I now own three recently issued Klemperer boxes: Beethoven Symphonies, Romantic Symphonies, and Concertos.  I own as single discs the content of Klemperer's Brahms box, and I have his \\"Flying Dutchman\\" and \\"Fidelio.\\"  So . . . I like Otto Klemperer.  This Mozart Operas box is a tremendous bargain, like the others I've mentioned, but these recordings ought not to be the only ones you own of these operas (\\"Marriage of Figaro,\\" \\"Don Giovanni,\\" \\"Cosi Fan Tutte, \\" and \\"Magic Flute\\").  They are idiosyncratic, problematic, and yet very compelling, but for purposes of comparison, you would do well to have on hand Guilini's \\"Marriage\\" and \\"Don Giovanni,\\" Abbado's or Haitink's \\"Flute,\\" and Solti's or Davis's \\"Cosi.\\"  In this box, the least controversial performance is of the \\"Flute\\" -- a very good cast, good sound, and no spoken dialogue.  It's considered a \\"classic of the gramophone,\\" so I'll say no more about it here.<br /><br />The other operas are paced much more deliberately than one usually hears, so their success depends on the quality of the cast and their ability to bring their roles dramatically to life under Klemperer's direction.  The Klemperer sound is well to the fore: massive sound, solid, steady rhythms, lovely woodwind playing, and real care for phrasing, even at the slower tempos.  Does it work? Or rather, where does it work and where doesn't it?  First, a caveat: one feature of the sound is that the musical numbers are recorded in a different aural space than the recitatives.  That doesn't make the sound bad, but it's a distraction for a while.  Comments on individual operas follow:<br /><br />\\"Marriage of Figaro\\":  Geraint Evans is Figaro, and he's very good, singing with character (he's a bitter, angry Figaro) and well-supported tone.  Teresa Berganza is Cherubino, as good as any on record.  Margaret Price and Kiri Te Kanawa (!) have tiny roles -- they were very young in 1970.  But Elisabeth Soederstrom and Reri Grist are disappointing as the Countess and Susanna.  Their voices are edgily caught by the microphones, and Grist's perky soubrette voice doesn't seem right for the part.  Where was Lucia Popp?  The Count is Gabriel Bacquier -- not really in command of all of the music here.  So it's a mixed bag, and when the singing is less than stellar, it can be drag.  When Evans and Berganza take center stage, they make it work.<br /><br />\\"Don Giovanni\\":  Claire Watson is a tentative Donna Anna, and Nicolai Gedda struggles with the florid run in \\"Il mio tesoro\\" (taken uncomfortably slowly), but Christa Ludwig is a committed Elvira, Walter Berry a very positive Leporello, Franz Crass a fine Commendatore, Popp a lively Zerlina, and above all, there's the wonderful bass sound of Ghiaurov as the Don.  The final scene in Guilini's version (from \\"Gia la mensa\\" on) is one of the great ones, but listen to Klemperer's.  It's slower, but the drama is never in doubt, with everyone singing and acting their heads off.  I don't prefer that final scene to Guilini's, but it's totally successful on its own terms.<br /><br />\\"Cosi fan Tutte\\": I was surprised -- the closest thing to a total success, apart from the \\"Flute.\\"  But look at the cast -- Margaret Price and Yvonne Minton as the sisters, Alva and Evans as their young men, and Hans Sotin as perhaps the most vocally resplendent Alfonso on record -- and Popp as Despina.  None of these singers has any trouble being expressive at Klemperer's tempi, and the result is compelling.  The pace gives an undertone of sobriety to the whole thing (no sparkle here), but arguably this opera shouldn't sparkle.  It's a very dark comedy indeed.  Karl Bohm's EMI version perhaps comes closest, but this is very fine.  Price was a very great artist, and Yvonne Minton tended to be overshadowed in the public mind by Janet Baker (Davis's great Dorabella), but she was a great singer in her own right.  The ensembles are just beautifully lucid, with Sotin's bass sitting under everything like the Rock of Gibraltar.<br /><br />Is the box worth the price? Absolutely.ltar.<br /><br />Is the box worth the price? Absolutely.
1451627289|5.0|Jake Epping, a High School English teacher, regularly eats at Al Templeton's diner, always wondering how Al manages to stay in business with such low prices. One day at the end of the school year Al asks Jake to come over so he can talk with him. In the 24 hours since Jake last saw him, Al has become seriously ill and visibly older. Al shows Jake a time portal that can transport him back in to September 9, 1958 and explains that it doesn't matter how long you spend in the past you always return back to the present day having only missed two minutes, but aging doesn't freeze in the past! Each subsequent trip back to 1958 is a total reset, erasing any changes previously made.<br /><br />Jake learns that Al has been going back to the past trying to stop the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1962 and change history. Now that Al is sick, he asks Jake to finish what he started. Jake hesitantly travels back to 1958 stays for an hour and goes back to 2011 seeing that Al and everything else is exactly as he left it.<br /><br />A couple of years earlier Jake set an assignment for his evening GED class, an essay titled \\"The Day That Changed My Life.\\" One student's essay stuck with him, Harry Dunning's story of how his alcoholic father killed his mother, two older brothers, and younger sister while Harry escaped with serious injuries. The attack took place on Halloween night in 1958, so Jake decides to use this to find out if he can indeed change history using the time portal.<br /><br />Jake becomes George Amberson in 1958 and the rest of the book takes you through his attempts to stop the assassination. While there he makes a life for himself, gets a job teaching, makes an impact on students lives, and falls in love.<br /><br />But George finds that the future doesn't want to be changed and is constantly faced with challenges he has to overcome in order to succeed.<br /><br />11/22/63 is one of the greatest, most captivating books I have ever read. It has become my favorite of King's works, and it is definitely one that I will reread. When I do, I just know that I will notice heaps of things that I missed the first time round. The research that went in to this piece is evident throughout and the work involved is detailed in King's afterword.y favorite of King's works, and it is definitely one that I will reread.

B0070DOHQS|5.0|I just LOVE how it has both major protocols covered in one application! Now I can use the same app to connect with my Windows, Linux AND Mac OSX boxes, transparently and seamlessly. Bravo! This is the best remote desktop app I have ever seen on Android! FIVE well deserved stars!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|What a wonderful story with a surprise ending. I especially liked the way the author used the Irish dialect. . . Such as a \\"wee cup of tea.\\"  The characters were well described and very realistic. This book is going to stick in my mind for a long time.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is an excellent period piece drama. The actors are of the highest caliber, it's well written, the sets are beautiful, and the costumes are amazing. I have become a Downton Abbey Addict!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This is basically a love story - a vampire and a witch fall in love!  Lots of information about the different species - especially if you are a believer of such things!<br /><br />A bit of a slow start but well worth getting thru the first few chapters.
B005I0DD42|5.0|Even if The Isle of Wight album did not include a nearly complete performance of Tommy, the level of ensemble musicianship throughout is staggering.  There's humor, virtuosity, pathos, and balls-to-the-wall rocking.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Great book. Almost as good as Vince Flynn.  Would be a great series.  Really good character development.  A lot like Jack Reacher.
B00B9LNLTQ|4.0|The album features some strong tracks, but other refill tracks don't pack the punch from previous The Strokes records. Still pretty good to give a full listen.
B005EVVESM|5.0|I love this CD and listen to it often.  The music is great.  I have recommended this to my friends and family.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|I've read this book five times now, and its just as good as the first time I read it. One of the best books ever written!
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I had not seen the movie in theaters and just thought it sounded like it would be a good movie.  I really enjoyed it more than I expected and have recommended it to several other people.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great ensemble cast and interesting short and long term story lines. Hard to single out performances, but Kalinda and Eli Gold are standouts . The writers have laid the groundwork for more complexity in Season 2.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|I'm amazed at how much meat there is to a game with only 16 cards. Everyone I've shown it to has loved it. Highly recommend.
1416583432|5.0|I could not stop reading it.  I read it twice. I told some of my dog loving friends about it and even bought a copy for my daughter -- a birthday present.  We humans think we know everything about dogs and I think we need to think outside the box and consider the possibilities about how they think and how we can use that information to improve our bonds with our canine companions.  This book helps you evaluate new paradigms and to consider new possibilities. To know is to understand.  I personally thought it was very well done.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Very funny move. Plot was much different than I expected. Classic Tarantino schtick. Really loved the scene with the hood issues.
B0094M4R3Q|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  I watched it because I plan to see the broadway musical. Since I don't have young children I was not familiar with the book.
B00371XIJE|4.0|This is one of those movies that you almost didn't want to see it, but glad you did. It puts life in a little bit better perspective.
B004J4WLPU|5.0|A great book.  I loved the way Lupton revealed the deeper layers of her characters as the book progressed.  She showed motivations rather than telling them.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Meeting Lavinia, the main character, was eye opening.  I knew little about white slaves, aside from indentured servitude, which this essentially is, initially.  What was disappointing? She never wakes up to the harsh realities of her shifting positions.  Moreover, to have married a man she knew was deeply affected in childhood by abuse, was foolish.<br />The characters are well developed and I truly felt there were better ways to shape the story line, but I am not an author.  Ms. Grissom further explains how the voices of ghosts told this story to her.  Our book club essentially tore the whole story apart, chunk by chunk, and boiled it down the bitter facts.  Ms. Grissom's narrative flows easily, and I can hear the characters voices in my head.  So for that I say job well done.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I love this book. It was very good and it drew you in. It made you want to read more and never put it down. I definitely recommend thus book!!
B0073XW096|5.0|I received my order quickly and the book was in good condition.  I would buy again!  This is a classic story and one we needed another copy of.
B007RCJNDE|3.0|After the marathon that was this series and the death of its author i did not have high hops for the last 3 books. But then first 2 were good, they got the series back on track and increased the tempo but i felt that at the end of A Memory of Light that ultimately Jordan's never knew how the story was to end. I read this book to get closure, but i will doubt i will ever pick it up again.
B00C3UUZVE|4.0|The grandchildren really love playing this game.  They love clicking on the mailbox and having the squirrel peak out and make noise.  They enjoy planting and watering the garden.
B007JM3HPM|5.0|Tremendous book, well written, researched and structured. It gives a fascinating insight into the minds and personalities of some of the most powerful men in the world. Bravo!
0307454568|5.0|I am reading the final chapter right now! Loved all three books, story is building and I can't put it down...got go...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Unlike, many of the independent books I’ve read lately, there is nothing amateurish about this volume; the writing is excellent, and I didn’t notice any typos or editing errors.<br />The story quickly sucked me in and left me wanting more.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book so much! Would definitely recommend! Love the fact that it had me cracking up at some parts and crying my eyes out on others! Definitely a must read! Think I just found a new favorite author!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|If you really, (I mean REALLY), like puzzles that are quirky and challenging, then THE ROOM is the tab game for you! Do not expect the typical &quot;hidden object&quot; to find an item among a plethora of object piles. It's not easy, but when you start putting together all the scattered clues, symbols, objects, &amp; even mechanical structures, it's an awesome rush. However, if you are the type of person looking for instant gratification, then go on back to the bang, bang, blow everything up games.
B00B1R8TCM|5.0|The whole album is great. Haven't heard a bad song yet. Instant blues classic. If you love the blues this is great but.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I play this game all the way through at various difficulty levels and just keep enjoying it. Keep up the good work.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Lovely book. A real look into the sad world of foster youth. Well written. Kept my interest. Highly recommended. Great read!
B001AEF6BI|5.0|Came in great condition. Had no problems (ie no skipping or scratches on the disk). Was exactly what I wanted.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Great classic for all ages; Had not read before. Was inspired by my granddaughters band concert that featured music from the movie. Also, my doctor had mentioned it.
B003TTH4IU|5.0|This is a smart, funny and all around entertaining show. Love all the characters and their different quirks. Mc Steamy especially!
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|For the long-awaited last book of the series, it's a little boring.  Obviously, still need to read it since I've been a fan of the series for so long.
B00BDAP66E|3.0|The app is still laggy and slow with a deficiency of many other feature and tends to have a bad efficiency in other things but its still great to have.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Worked as described.  I have a problem getting the downloaded song to appear in Windows Media.  This is somewhat annoying.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun! It is sorta like temple run but with trains and you go to a different place each time which makes it even more fun! If you want a game that is free and a time waster and fun get this game!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|By far the best app I have purchased. Plague Inc. is a very unique game and is definently worth the extremely cheap $0.99. I would pay at least $10 for this game! My favorite plague is the Nuerax Worm which eventually allows you to enslave all humans. Worth every cent. Please make more plagues to buy. I will buy them.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This is the second life proof I have bought. The first was for me the second one(this one) is for a friend. I have never had any issues with it. IT is much more slimmer than the OB. I know OB has great warranty and product support but I have not had to use it yet on the LP.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I bought this app on a whim, but it has become one of my favorite apps. My daughter. And mother like it as well. I recommend this to any one.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great story with great acting job by Jennifer Lawrence.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Can't wait for the next one.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Can't wait til next season. Didn't have all the episodes thru cable and amazon was cheaper than iTunes. I just watched on my iPad thru the amazon app
B00BU8RNCE|5.0|Unbelievable courage by a family that truly loved each other.  Superb acting job by all actors.  Gotta see this movie.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|This is a good Baldacci book.  Enough action to keep one's interest.  For the price I found the book very enjoyable.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|Fantastic movie!  Deserved the academy awards!  I could watch it over and over again.  Loved it!  Good purchase for anyone.
B003QS9WIE|5.0|Seen it over and over, ill always find something new in this movie. I just wish they had subtitles for the movies
B00B10DZQE|4.0|Loved the movie.  But, had a sad ending!  Shame it was a true story and know that that young man lost his life.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|We don't generally like sci fi/futuristic movies, but this one was just a really good story, and well acted.  We recommend giving it a try even if, like us, you don't usually like off beat, fantastical stories.
B008VVT51U|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, but it is a little slow.  Gotta see it to appreciate it.  Give it a try
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed reading Gone Girl.  The story line was captivating and realistic but it was disturbing only because of how realistic the author portrayed the characters.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|I always have liked Anthony Hopkins films, and this one didn't disappoint. I liked how the film mimicked Hitchcock's TV show at the beginning and end.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I first read this as a teenager, and I still have the same reaction to it. I wish I had friends like that, and I wish I had friends who were that close. King's characters are ordinary human beings. His nightmares are not. It is a pleaser because we all fear the monster in the dark, and It is still a pleaser. Stephen King has earned his kudos and his stories still make you long for a life that is not yours own while simultaneously making you glad to live in the real world. Be sure to read this one with the lights on folks....
B008O69SZ0|5.0|This CD rocks!  I saw Ian in concert in New Jersey and I can say he's a hit!  Fabulous show!  The CD is terrific!  I fully recommend purchasing this CD!  If you like classic rock, you will love Ian!  Ian previously performed with Mott The Hoople and a new CD from Mott The Hoople is now out!  Great show and great CD!  Thanks Ian!
B00BD05PEW|4.0|This is a pretty well done figure. For $25 it's expensive, comparing you can get other dinosaurus from Papo at this size for $11-$13. It's almost the same size as Papo's Styracosaurus or Pachyrhinosaurus. This figure should be as large as Papo's Allosaurus.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|even those of us that don't think of how to build something in legos think it's fun.  seems easier for the boys that play with, or grew up playing with legos though!  Still a fun family game that we can all play.
086571701X|5.0|Very helpful for the novice. Book contained info on different setups, fish that do well, and different levels you need to monitor and how. Very well put together.
B003UYV08E|4.0|it has everything a sequel needs to entertain and continue the arc.  It falls short of the original, but then no sequel has surpassed the original since the Godfather part 2, so.....
B00BSBY38A|5.0|one of the most moving films I have ever seen.  a combination of animal rescue and survival.  a MUST SEE in my opinion, for all animal lovers and nature lovers alike.
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|Robert downey jr. continues to portray the iconic sleuth with a manic psychology that is believable and fun.  The chemistry between he a jude law is excellent.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I have read the first 5 books of A Game of Thrones and absolutely loved them.  The first four are wonderful, the 5th book the author kind of moves away from the story line, adds new characters, and it was my least favorite.  However, I am anxiously awaiting book 6 - waiting for my favorite characters to come to life again.  A Game of Thrones is in it's third season on HBO, and the excitement is building.  I have added the books to my Kindle and will be rereading each book.  Fantastic books!
B000GT6KEU|5.0|this is an awesome musical to watch. my girlfriend and i love to watch it at least once a week
B006MW3UZW|4.0|This is one of our most favorite shows.  We have found it amazing that English television puts together such terrific drama without the smut.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|excellent movie. i recommend it to all ages. it was entertaining and fun to watch. it also had a good story line
B005LAIIJY|5.0|This is a very good movie! My husband went to see it and then I went back to see it with some young people. Great movie!
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|to me this was a movie about a drunk. who wants to watch movies about drunks. do yourself a favor and skip this one
B001GCUNYO|4.0|We actually watched Taken 2 first it was so good I had to buy this one and totally enjoyed it as well.
B00BF11STU|4.0|this was a good movie it kept my interest threw the whole movie. i would recommend this movie to all adults over 16
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|This is a funny movie to watch with your partner. Sometimes we get in a middle age/mid relationship rut. This movie makes it funny. There is a lot of &#34;f&#34; bombs and adult situations so make sure it is a movie you do no watch with kids. lol!
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|this was a good movie. a little bit too bloody for young adults. the story line was good and keep my interest
B009CCBCU4|4.0|This was a good read, I would like to read more along the same line. I will be looking for more by this author.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|this was a good movie. the story line was good. but the movie seemed to drag on a little bit.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|After the first episode I was hooked I couldn't get enough game of thrones watched season one and two and caught up on three in a three day weekend! Great series!
0887307280|5.0|Great Book. Easy to understand and practical. It makes sense.  Teaches you how to do things better, and more consistently in your business.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Despicable me is good family fun.  My 5 year old boys loved it.  I would recommend.  Waiting for the second one to come out.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love it on my kindle it runs very good so far no gliches and it keeps me entertained for hours on end
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|It gives you no time to do anything<br /><br />It sucks you can't do any thing on it  it only gives you like five minutes
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I wrote a book with almost the same title with this book before I could not get a chance of reading this book. But time came for me to search the net for titles that are similar to mine and I have found this book by KDP team. The book is short, yet very helpful. I have learned how to work with my interior design more than before just after reading this book. I have learned how to build my table of contents that will work fine on all ebook readers not only on Kindle readers. I have even learned how to upload my book with multiple pictures in a very easy way.<br /><br />Thanks KDP team for writing such a guide. I have written most of the things on my book titled, \\"Publishing a Book on Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing\\", yet yours is short with everything a self-publisher needs to know. God bless KDP.<br /><br />John
B00AO7HQ06|4.0|Comprehensive collection of his work over a wide range of performances.  It shows how many directions he might have taken over the long run had he been able.
B00BJS7104|5.0|Django is a well written movie.  The actors were amazingingly great.  This movie takes you on an adventure and there is never a dull moment.  The movie is entertaining, thrilling, and extremely funny!!!
B000Q76K24|4.0|I just happened to see the first half of this movie on TV last week.  For some reason, it stayed with me & I ended up renting it on-line so I could see the ending.  Matt Damon does a very good job portraying a founder of the CIA during the period after WWII.  I grew up during that period & the movie really struck a true chord for me.  Damon's character has to make difficult decisions & through it all he keeps his feelings under wraps.  If you are of &#34;a certain age&#34; you will probably be able to relate to this movie.
B006LSZECO|5.0|My wife kept telling me that I would like this book but I did not believe her. I started it twice and thought it was going to be the literary equivalent of a &#34;chick flick&#34;. When I finally gave it a chance I could not put it down. It kept  me guessing and switching allegiance between characters. I know people like these characters and now I wonder what they are capable of ... Hopefully not anything like what happens in this book.<br />I am off to read more by Ms. Flynn
B004X4R3FE|5.0|The King's Speech is a glimpse into history and the very real challenge of having a speech impediment.  The acting is excellent and inspiring.  May all those who see this movie have a greater admiration for others with a disability and may those with a disability recognize that they are capable of more than they ever dreamed!
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This game is more than I expected.  The graphics are my style very bright and great looking characters.  I have never watched the anime but I have seen whole lot of others.  The shortcuts to skip scene or warp to another area is an awesome option and I hope all future RPGs have this in mind when they create another game. The story just builds and builds so you look forward to another day of upgrading your characters or just enjoying some fishing.  I honestly feel like there is so much to do in this game and so little time to do it.  I will try not to ruin anything for you all and I really recommend this game to fans of anime/RPGs!  Thank you for your time.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Very enlightening to see how many wifi radio signals are present at many locations, and which bands they are working on. Very handy to have on the tablet.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It was very unpredictable and well written. I couldn't stop reading to find out what would happen next. Big surprise half way through.
B00428CPUY|4.0|A worthy successor of the other Crossroads DVDs.  Great lineup of guitarist with quality sound.  Possibly the last recorded performances by several of the old guard blues legends.
B003O86FMW|3.0|As I said in my original review of the The Hunger Games, I liked the story and how it moves along. I said I enjoyed how Ms. Collins used the character's exposition to fill in the plot lines. I didn't like so much the writing. Now I like it even less. Her explanations, her using Katniss' words which are not her words but the writer's words, got to me this time around. All the voices in the story sound the same. The writing style is simplistic and old. There is nothing new in the way she tells her story. So, the story is interesting and fun, but the story telling is so very predictable. I give it three stars.
1616550414|5.0|This is just simply amazing. Young or old, this brings back some memories. Zelda fans will definitely be pleased with this purchase.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I loved this book. The story is written from the perspective of the child and that makes it both more interesting and heart braking. The author gives the boy a very realistic voice.
B000P6PVLC|5.0|I don't usually write reviews but the fact that this film continues to get one star reviews absolutely baffles me, this film provides the audience with such strong connections with each protagonist in each story of the film that it seems people found it hard to deal with. A film about the true nature of humankind and the factors that bind us across cultures, for those of you that enjoy a deep drama with an amazing soundtrack and amazing acting.
B005D4YONW|5.0|This is my second pair of Keen's sandals. The first pair has lasted over three years and still has life in them. Most comfortable footwork Ive ever owned. They are worth the money!
B009NG1Q96|2.0|I should start by saying I WANT to like this book. I really do. I'm a sucker for dystopian fiction, love me some costume dramas, and what the heck, enjoy romance novels of any kind, smutty or innocent. However, this read a bit like an un-edited fanfiction.<br /><br />I will say I liked that America developed a little more interest in her future rather than what husband she ends up with. I LOVED the interaction with her father, and finding out more of the history of the country. However, after the umpteenth time that she wavered between Maxon and Aspen, I found myself wishing for something with much more substance. I get it- romantic triangles are hot right now. But I kept thinking, where's the 3rd option? What happened to the girl who (spoilers) runs up on stage to try to save her best friend - why does that fire keep getting watered down into &#34;Should I be a housewife or princess?&#34;<br /><br />A lot of my disappointment comes from the sheer amount of potential in this book that didn't happen. You've cut down the number of characters - great! Let's give them some greater complexity and a description that doesn't sound like middle school cliches - except, oh wait, nope, Girl X is still a slutty bitch, and Girl Y is nice but a rival so we can't actually be friends. What, are we stuck in a Taylor Swift album? You're exploring some of the darker sides of the country- awesome! Except you're relying on overdone tropes, where the good king isn't so good and is maybe actually quite abusive, and the former hero of the country suddenly grows a mustache and begins twirling it maliciously like some 1950's cartoon villain.<br /><br />My overall feel of this series is it's a bit like a souffle - very pretty to look at, but as soon as you shake it up a bit, it collapses. I think they have a lot of potential, but suffer from a lack of mature, complex character development.
1451695187|5.0|I purchased this book as a gift for my girlfriend who is deeply religious. She said this is one of the most intriguing books she has ever read and I think in the 4 weeks she has had it, shes read it a solid 3 times.She goes on and on about it and has recommended it to every one of her facebook friends about 100 times.
B0095P29EG|5.0|I have seen &#34;Thor&#34; several times now and it just seems to get better and better! I wonder if there will be a sequel?
B00ATWS9XE|5.0|To me, the greatest war movie ever made. The Steelbook edition is a great addition to my film collection. Completely worth the money I spent.
B005FISBTO|5.0|This was the best season yet...can't wait for Number Seven to become available!  This is the most clever and intriguiging series ever....so well written and acted!
B00BZOFUI2|4.0|For starters, I have obviously been out of the DP loop for awhile. I was under the impression that Steve Morse was fairly new to the band. He has been around for a bit. While I know of him, I never really heard anything by him. With this release I have a new respect for him. The guy has obviously been chosen for DP for a reason. Which will lead me to checking out some of the earlier stuff done with him. I may see if there is a live concert available with him onboard on DVD. With that being said, I needed more guitar with this release. It is very heavy on the keyboards, which has already been stated. I guess, in tribute to Jon Lord. Don Airey is obviously the next best choice. This guy has got a great resume. Just a little over the top for my liking. Need more guitar riffs and flash.<br />I lost touch with DP after The House Of Blue Light. While that release only did fair in reviews, I liked it. Perfect Strangers would be hard to follow.<br />Everyone is on there game here, but it kind of runs half and half for me. My favorites are:<br />Hell to Pay: Catchy tune<br />Above and Beyond: Good<br />Blood from a Stone: A slower number but good<br />Apres Vous: Closest to classic DP<br />All the Time in the World: Slower tune, kind of has that Pink Floyd vibe<br />Vincent Price: Cool tune, felt it almost belongs on Black Sabbath Born Again<br /><br />I was hoping for something more along the classic vibe that hits a homerun such as Perfect Strangers, but this fell short. Still find it great to hear these guys doing their thing. This band has been through a lot, if not more than most bands and the fact they are still plugging away is great. Richie Blackmore to me, is not missed, buy hearing what Steve Morse has to offer up.
B001N3GUIE|4.0|This movie is by far the best of the 50's Sci-Fi era. There are so many firsts, Robby the Robot, the Ancient Alien Civilization, interwoven with Greek Mythology i.e. Dr. Edward Morbius', Walter Pidgeon, being the surviving member of the spaceship  Bellerophon. Hollywood has wanted to remake Forbidden Planet more than any other Science Fiction Film, but being such a cult classic the bar is set so high its doubtful that any remake could live up to the original.
B0070DOHQS|3.0|Overall a great app. Just a couple problems I saw in my short use. It seems like if you're computer is asleep or hibernating there is no way to access your desktop. It's an interesting app but this really limits its usefulness. Make it possible to awaken a sleeping computer and it'll be 4 stars.<br /><br />I also had trouble controlling. I only used it for a short time with Google earth but I had trouble doing anything useful. Not sure how this could be improved.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|awesome game for mystery solvers and hidden object finders I was hooked and played it all night with my son who also enjoyed it.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Simple and easy. It works well on Windows XP which is not the case with Icloud. Love my KindleFire HD too.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|Although much less grand than his historical fiction, Mr. Follett is a good story teller.  The story is fairly gripping and the characters mostly believable.  Anyone who likes suspense and a quick read will enjoy this book.

B0094BB4TW|3.0|got this Facebook for my Kindle Fire.  I also use it on my iPhone and my laptop.  Some of the changes Facebook has made I'm not crazy about, but it allows me to keep up with what my friends are doing.  I wish they would cut out all the advertisements.  I have to search through the advertisements to find my friends.

1439102813|5.0|5***** and a &#10084<br /><br />Alice Howland, Ph.D., professor of Psychology and Linguistics at Harvard University, wife and mother, begins to notice that she is forgetting things. No, not just where she put her keys, but words and thoughts and directions.  Still, when she's diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's Disease she is stunned.<br /><br />The brilliance of Genova's book is that she writes from Alice's perspective.  The reader experiences the slow decline as one daily function after another becomes challenging, difficult and even impossible to perform.  The last third of the book is particularly poignant.<br /><br />I had a very hard time with this book.  My mother is in the final stages of this terrible disease.  She is no longer mobile. She cannot speak.  She is just a physical shell of a person, the woman she was either locked away or perhaps completely lost to us and to herself.  She does not recognize any of her family or friends, but, like Alice, she still recognizes love.<br /><br />One final word about the audio version of this book.  Had I been rating this based on the audio performance I would have given it only 3-stars.  How I wish a professional voice-over artist had been hired to do the reading!  Genova clearly believes strongly in the work and the message, but she reads with the same inflection throughout.  So it is difficult to follow conversations at times because the listener cannot effectively tell which character is speaking.  This is especially true early in the book when Alice isn't so severely impaired, and her use of language matches the other speakers.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I love these series of books and can not wait for the next one to come out! Defiantly a must read
B005EPFA8I|5.0|I watched this with a friend who had heard about it from his college geology professor. It is quite interesting and I would definitely recommend it.<br /><br />It is about the discovery and research of the Chauvet Cave in France. Chauvet has some of the oldest prehistoric artwork known, and it has changed a lot of scientific thinking regarding how long ago mankind developed artistic ability.<br /><br />The artwork in Chauvet cave is very well preserved -- so well preserved that when it was found, many scientists said it must be a forgery for the art to look that fresh. Other scientists were able to prove the artwork's age by testing the thin layers of calcite that have deposited over the top of the artwork over the 30 000 years since the art was put on the cave walls. Carbon dating has also helped establish the dates of the artwork as well.<br /><br />The only quibbles I would have with it are: (1) the section at the end with the crocodiles didn't really fit anything else that came before and (2) while there was a lot of emphasis on how little time researchers could spend in the cave, there wasn't much discussion about why that was necessary. I had to do some further research on the internet to find out what has happened to other caves, particularly Lascaux, to find out why researchers in Chauvet are so limited in their time in the caves.<br /><br />Lastly, the part about the 3-D modeling of the caves was truly amazing from a technology perspective.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I saw the movie before reading The Hunger Games and was captivated by it. The book is so much more detailed than the movie and I found myself immersed in the characters that did not make the movie. This is a book that simply cannot be set aside. Excellent & fairly easy read.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This is the completion of the series.  It continues the plot with many twists and turns.  It has a little different flavor but with the same characters we know.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it I can play it all day I is so cool and fun be my friend love it:)
B00AQTY3XA|5.0|Unexpected amazing movie! I was expecting some cheesy surf movie...a complete surprise and well worth the purchase.  I put this movie in my top TEN.
B001RTP3YQ|4.0|I saw this on PBS. Some of it gets a little boring - others are spot on great. Over all, an enjoyable CD set.
B00BOX0K0M|5.0|I use this filter far more than my others. Works well for both snow and water shots, (surfing, snowboarding...) fixing any glare problems that I used to have to deal with. I haven't had the scratch issues other reviews have mentioned, but simple care seems to prevent that. A staple in any GoPro kit!
B00009P1O2|5.0|I have a number of Queen concert CDs and DVDs and I think this is probably the best one of the bunch. Filmed when they were at their best, in the mid-80s, the set list is great, creative, and comprehensive. An added bonus is the covers they play midway thought the show (&#34;Hello Mary Lou,&#34; &#34;Tutti Frutti,&#34; &#34;Gimme Some Lovin',&#34; etc.). In this DVD, Freddie shows just why he was the greatest front man to ever play in a rock and roll band. Brian's guitar sings, Roger rocks out, and John brings a cool bass line. It's really worth the money, and if you're going to get a Queen concert DVD, I certainly recommend this one.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Great bag for the money. Plenty of room that is also adjustable to fit different size equipment. With backpacks being banned at some events I hope this won't be a problem.
B008Y73940|5.0|While at times this movie is predictable, it still delivers with a good plot and great performance by McConaughey! If you like suspense movies this is a good one.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|If you really want to learn what is happening to our health in the US, watch this and Fork Over Knife.
B0095P33IW|4.0|I had this movie originally at a much lower priority than the other DC / Marvel character based movies but felt I needed to see it after I saw The Avenger's movie.  Other followers of the genre told me it wasn't that good.  After seeing it I beg to differ...I can only assume they reached their conclusion based upon comparison to the other more noteworthy titles like Iron Man and Thor.  While Captain America may not have the flash and pizzazz of the other two, it in it's own right tells a good story and the character development is even more solidified in this series than the others.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|For Christina McKenna's first novel she was right on.  The characters were well developed.  As the story progressed so did Jamie and Elizabeth.<br /><br />As a Catholic it was difficult for me to read about the orphanage.  I was ashamed and saddened by the treatment.  I was proud of the children especially Jamie.<br /><br />The story kept me reading into the night and I didn't expect the ending.  I really enjoy this read.
B006BDHAX0|3.0|Fun program until it decides to stop working.  Seems no rhyme or reason for when it happens; maybe a new update will fix the problem.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|The book was interesting from the start and hard to put down.  The novel is definitely made for mature readers.  I heard there is a movie adaptation coming out with Nicole Kidman.  I can't wait to see it ~~<br />If you like following narrative stories and solving mysteries this is the book for you.
B008Q07U5O|5.0|Writing, directing and acting all superb. A brilliant film noire, and one of Roman Polanski's great movies. John Huston is superb.
B00846WWVM|5.0|Ok so I have a lot of games that are very similar to this one. BUT none have the cute graphics and music this one has.  Plus it's fun saving the little critters :)  Never fear though it may look like nothing but a kids game on the surface, but each level gets progressively harder.
B000W93CHC|4.0|This is a very good read and I would recommend to anyone.It depicts life in its time very well and,of course,human nature.It shows how hard it was to do well even if one was highly talented,if one was not born into a high class family.<br />It interestingly gives an insight into building methods of those buildings that are left for us today to admire.<br />We get involved with the lives of those about whom the book is written which makes it hard to put down.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I loved this movie. It's really fun to see all the video game references. I've watched this movie several times now and I still catch new things. The bluray is awesome. One feature I really like is when you pause it and the host of web soup and the nerdist points out video game references and \\"hidden mickeys\\" throughout the movie.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|This was an action packed animated movie. It was done so well, that as it started it looked real and not animated. Lots of twists and turns. Good movie for the whole family. It had excellent audio and video quality...even on the kindle screen.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|If you want to get to certain levels you have to pay for them so if you let young children play they don't know they are clicking on a payment feature. Other than that it is a fun game for children and adults.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was one of The best books that I have read in awhile. Easy and fun to read. I think I even shed a few tears!
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|So well done and a great cast. The movie is a bit long, so be prepared. Highly entertaining--a bit hard to watch the content in some of the scenes. A must see.
B005ZUR724|5.0|amazing game with amazing graphics almost like a WoW in your pocket! people who say there is a phantom update for kindle just uninstall it then reinstall it and ham ur back in the game. overall great game and definitely wp<br />worth the money you have to pay for it. I'm even pretty sure they took out the subscriptions so you have to pay every month anymore! does take up a lot of your Kindle space about 1350 mbs

B000ID1J0E|3.0|This movie was kind of weird. This guy and his attorney were high throughout the whole movie. There were certain parts that were funny, and then there were parts that were rediculous.
B005DJREJS|5.0|This is a fresh, dare I say, fairly realistic view of teenagers in high school today.....one can only hope as a mother that it is quite exaggerated!
B0035LJY6C|5.0|I really love this movie through and through! It kept me lauphing from the start. If you are having a not -so-good day, just put this movie on! you are guaranteed to get a stomach ache (FROM LAUGHING)

0307387178|4.0|NARRATIVE ARC AND PARALLEL STRUCTURE– IN A NON-FICTION NOVEL<br /> When Jon Krakaur wrote an account of the untimely death of a young man who went into the wilds of Alaska with little more than his wits, he was faced with the daunting task of how he would write the story. In this creative non-fiction story, Krakaur used craft techniques that he could use in keeping a reader interested, particularly where most readers would know the ending before the story even began. Krakaur had already reported about Christopher Johnson McCandless’ fateful quest in Outside magazine. McCandless obviously examined the structure of any story, exposition, rising action, crisis, climax and denouncement, or resolution, and began to form how best to tell McCandless’ tragic story. He borrows the narrative arc technique from fiction, and uses parallel structure, interspersing several small stories, each with a different protagonist and antagonist, but with a common theme running through each, that ties the resolution together.<br />Krakaur’s story has a quasi-linear plot, with characters and setting, rising action, with conflicts and complications, and finally a resolution, where the ultimate question that had plagued the character from the start is resolved—except there are two main characters in this story, a story of layered structure, similar to Emily Bronte’s epic story, Wuthering Heights—McCandless, who, prior to his death finds that true happiness can only be found in sharing it, (Krakaur, 189) and Krakaur himself, who tells the story of his investigation and resolves the mystery of McCandless death that had been plaguing him for some time; poison sweet pea berries actually killed McCandless, not starvation from inexperience; and at the end, the restless look in his eyes was replaced with a look of serenity and peace. (Krakaur, 198-99).<br />From start to finish, the story is simply about this educated young man from a well-to-do Washington D.C. family who hitchhiked to Alaska in April of 1992, walked into the Alaskan forest with a small caliber hunting rifle, and minimal provisions, and died of what appeared to be starvation after surviving several months in the wild. The readers simply thought McCandless an imprudent, idealist who was ill prepared to meet the challenge. Krakaur wrote, “McCandless was ridiculously ill prepared [] he had no business heading into any wilderness … [there was] only one word for the guy: incompetent.” (Krakaur, 177).  In researching, and investigating this case for a novel, Krakaur found out differently.<br />Having been a similar wild youth, Krakaur wanted to show the reader “Why” some men hear the call of the wild, and do things that most others would be satisfied simply dreaming about. McCandless’ story was larger than life, and the perfect vehicle for Krakaur to propound his answer to the question. Although ostensibly about McCandless, this story is Krakaur’s memoir—his memory’s truth, stating: “I was haunted by the particulars of the boy’s starvation and by vague unsettling parallels in his life, and those of my own”(Krakaur, Author’s note, p.2).  He uses parallel structure to answer the resolution to an age old question, and the death of one young man—who found out too late, that “Happiness [is] only real when [it’s] shared”. (Krakaur, 189).<br />In using the stories of various other explorers, including his own, Krakaur proposes his theory, injecting it into the story as a resolution to the question that he poses in the beginning, why would someone want to walk deep into the bush and live off the land for a few months. (Krakaur, 4). Krakaur injects the question again through one of his characters, the boy’s mother, Billie: “I just don’t know why he had to take those kind of chances…” (Krakaur, 132). Thus, the reader is compelled to read on to find the answer, the resolution, that arrived after the death of the boy (climax of the story), and into the denouncement (resolution).<br />Krakaur begins his story in medias res (Krakaur, 3) and McCandless is dropped off by Gallion, an man with some experience in Alaska, and rising action builds almost immediately from the introduction of these characters where he remarks:<br /> Still, Gallien was concerned. Alex admitted that the only food in<br />his pack was a ten-pound bag of rice. His gear seemed exceedingly minimal<br />for the harsh conditions of the interior, which in April still lay buried under<br />the winter snowpack. Alex’s cheap leather hiking boots were neither waterproof nor well insulated. His rifle was onl .22 caliber, a bore too small to rely on if he<br />expected to kill large animals like moose and caribou, which he would have to<br />eat if he hoped to remain very long in the county. He had no ax, no bug dope,<br />no snowshoes, no compass. The only navigational aid in his possession was a<br /> tattered state road map he’d scrounged at a gas station. (Krakaur, 5).<br />This sets up the complications and conflict posed by man against nature, albeit not the main focus of the story. The action continues to rise throughout the author’s creative use of setting as he describes the land McCandless attempts to enter as ominous and remote. He writes: “A hundred miles out of Fairbanks the highway begins to climb into the foothills of the Alaska Range… the Stampede Trail … seldom traveled, [] isn’t even marked on most road maps of Alaska… in the middle of trackless wilderness north of Mt. McKinley.” (Krakaur, 5).<br />The story then jumps back to the preparations made by McCandless prior to his trek into the wild Alaska forest, breaking into the scenes of his troubled stay in the wild, and after describing the details of his short adult life, and death, it follows with Krakaur’s own memoir of not only his investigation (a layered technique) but the parallel story of his own youth, attempting to climb an impossible summit, and the stories of other persons who appeared to be equally imprudent.<br />Krakaur’s character begins to emerge in Chapter 8, where he examines the criticism he received from readers after the story he wrote about McCandless. “The prevailing Alaska wisdom held that McCandless was simply one more dreamy half-cocked greenhorn who went into the country expecting to find answers to all his problems and instead found only mosquitoes and a lonely death.” (Krakaur, 72). Krakaur then descends into a series of several parallel stories of other explorers to show the reader why this theory of foolhardy youth is not the case in McCandless’ death. “Dozens of marginal characters have marched off into the Alaska wilds over the years never to reappear. A few have lodged firmly in the state’s collective memory.” (Krakaur, 72). He then tells the stories of counterculture idealists, military leaders, wealthy academics, writers, and photographers, like Rossellini, John Mallon Waterman, Carl McCunn, and Everett Reuss, with varying stories, some similar, others in contrast to McCandless. Reuss wrote: “I shall always be a lone wanderer, of the wilderness. God knows how the trail lures me… the lone trail is the best…I’ll never stop wandering… And when it comes to die, I’ll find the loneliest, most desolate, spot there is.” (Krakaur: Reuss, 91).<br />But Krakaur recognizes that McCandless was no idealist, no crackpot, nor foolhardy wanderer who took chances with his life, nor failed to appreciate the risks. McCandless writes: “If this adventure proves fatal and you don’t ever hear from me again I want you to know you are a great man. I now walk into the wild.” (Krakaur, 133-34). Having read the other parallel stories that ended in disaster for most, the reader is now enticed to find out why. It was his own portion of the book that was his memoir, that Krakaur feeds the reader a resolution to the story behind the death of McCandless.<br />I was twenty three, younger than McCandless, when he walked<br />into the Alaska bush. My reasoning, if one can call it that, was<br />enflamed with the scattershot passions of youth and a literary diet<br />overly rich in the works of Nietzsche, Keroac, and John Menlove Edwards, the later a deeply troubled writer and psychiatrist who,<br />before putting an end to his life with a cyanide capsule in 1958,<br />had been one of the preeminent British rock climbers of the day.<br />Edwards regarded rock climbing as a “Psycho-neurotic tendency”;<br />he climbed not for sport, but to find refuge from the inner torment<br />that framed his existence. (Krakauer, 135).<br />Krakauer allows the reader to draw its own conclusion but only after he sets up these parallel stories to draw the comparison. He further exalts McCandless’ obsession to go into the wilderness as not simply a youthful whim, but much more. He presents the reader with his own Alaskan wilderness story, replete with inner thoughts, and an epiphany, that strongly suggests the resolution the reader should find in the denoument  of McCandless’ story.  Although the grueling story of Krakauer’s experience to cross treacherous terrain to climb an icy face of Devil’s Thumb, seemed much more dangerous an ordeal than that which McCandless put himself through, the author completes the narrative arc quite effectively by drawing a resolution in parallel story of his feat. Comparing the “skewed relationships” each had with their fathers, the “similar intensity, similar heedlessness, and similar agitation of the soul”, the reader is satisfied that McCandless died from a freakish accident, and was driven to the wilderness not by a death wish but by some deep seated desire to accomplish some impossible feat that would help fix his broken life. (Krakauer, 155). The reader is compelled to believe McCandless, if he survived, would feel the same way as Krakauer, “I suffered from hubris, perhaps, and an appealing innocence, certainly, but I wasn’t suicidal;” and as the parallel story implies, neither was McCandless. (Krakauer,<br /> 155). Thus, the narrative arc is complete, with the resolution.<br /><br />____________________<br /> Krakauer, Jon. Into The Wild. Random House. New York. 1996.<br />Bronte, Emily.

B0015HOFZI|5.0|I wanted to record all my old records onto my PC. This little \\"cheap\\" looking turn table did the job just fine. I read a lot of the reviews and many folks complained that it's made of plastic and looks \\"cheap\\". Well, it doesn'tcost much but that's the only thing \\"cheap\\" about it. And really, what isn't made of plastic these days? I recorded about 200 albums and it worked fine throughout. The software that came with it could be better, and their software support doesn't exist. I sent them an email in December 2012 and still have not received a reply (May  2013). That aside, I am very pleased with my Sony turntable.

B00992CF6W|4.0|This is by far the best game I have ever downloaded in my life but it definitely needs an update. Their should be pressure pads, switches, buckets and all kinds of stuff. They need to make this a little more like the original minecraft. The least they could do is put in cheats. (And yes everyone uses them) I could go on and on and on about the things that they should add.I would give it five stars if they added a better update and I know it just got updated but they need to do a better job in the updating business. Honestly it would.be good to just add cheats or mods or even cakes but until then, I'm not going to give this 5 stars.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This app is very addicting and fun.  You get to do a lot of fun stuff.  I only wish you didn't run out of energy
B0091XEW9M|5.0|I have watched this movie many times and it never gets old. I seem to find something new each time I watch the movie.
B005GY0Y8S|2.0|I would be upset if I had paid for this book... I wanted to quit reading it a dozen times, but I hate not finishing a book.  It did get more interesting and I read it all.  I could not figure out the who done-it until it was revealed, but there were so many unanswered questions that I had in the end that I felt like the story was not complete for me or maybe I just missed the answers .  I didn't like how the writer would change charcters or directions on the next paragraph, not even make it a new chapter, kept me confused alot.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is so awesome. I really like designing things like buildings and making them have fancy and decorative interiors. I also like crafting things, growing crops, mining ores, and building awesome fortresses. One of the things I recommend you try is to make a stairway down to a giant cavern that you have built, destroy all torches and other sources of light and cover it up (where ever you would put a door), and the next morning break the barrier and you've got a monster hunting area, complete with all types of monsters(if you made it large enough for that to happen),which when you are done , can be reused by covering up the opening  and waiting for the next morning, which will again be full with monsters.<br />  This app is so amazing, I would buy it for fifteen dollars and still give it the same high rating. Don't listen to the reviews that talk about how horrible minecraft is. There are only 400 one star ratings and over ten times as many five star ratings. I bet at least twenty one star reviews are by jealous competitors trying to make minecraft look bad. Just something to remember: minecraft is the one other competitors try to copy which gives it away that they even think minecraft is a great game. I mean, why else would they try to copy minecraft if they didn't like it. What I am basically trying to say is that almost everyone loves minecraft, even its own competitors.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|A lot of fun and challenging though I wish it came with more than four aircraft to fly and land
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|The acting is excellent in this movie it's the story line that sucks!  Basically it's a drunk driver who killed people because of his drinking and then gets legal help to get him out of it.  The girlfriend looked more like his daughter....sorry...I was just never able to get &#34;into&#34; this movie.

B0070DOHQS|5.0|I can't believe this app was free today! I'm an Ubuntu user and the vnc server was (relatively) simple to setup. Works fast and reliably! Can't wait to try it with Windows 8, too!
B00785P2QC|2.0|I purchased this game and got on. I hated the fact that if you wanted to  expand, buy new things, or unlock stuff you had to use invest points. You eventually get so low that you have to buy them. I do not want to spend money on that JUST to get invest points.
B000EGF0B4|5.0|I HAVE HEARD MANY DIFFERENT THINGS ABOUT THIS MOVIE SINCE IT FIRST CAME OUT. MOST OF THEM UNTRUE. IT IS A MOVIE THAT I WOULD CALL THOUGHT PROVOKING, AND FOUND IT TO BE A GOOD MOVIE.

B004KKX80A|5.0|Something new I haven't seen here in the stores. Pretty heavy, don't want to get hit with this one, sometimes they don't always go in the stadium as expected.

0385349947|4.0|\\"Lean In\\" is a superbly written book.  In my opinion, it is also highly controversial because the main premise of the book focuses on the general stereotypes that exist for women versus men.  By stereotypes I mean the following as quoted from the book all of which are true in general:<br /><br />- \\"Women lower their own expectations.\\" \\"....women face a battle from within.\\"<br /><br />- \\"Professional ambition is expected of men but is optional--or worse, sometimes even a negative--for women.\\"<br /><br />- \\"From the moment we are born boys and girls are treated different.\\"<br /><br />- \\"When a man is successful, he is liked by both men and women.  When a woman is successful, people of both genders like her less.\\"<br /><br />- \\"One miscalculation that some women make is to drop out early in their careers because their salary barely covers the cost of child care.\\"  The author believes staying in the workforce reaps more benefits later on even if you are in essence working for nothing by having all your money go to child care.<br /><br />- The author quoted a study that proved that \\"Exclusive maternal care was not related to better or worse outcomes for children.  There is, thus, no reason for mothers to feel as though they are harming their children if they decide to work.\\"<br /><br />- The author mentions how a Google search for \\"Facebook's male CEO\\" returns the message \\"No results found.\\"<br /><br />- Referring to women, Sheryl says \\"It's up to us to end the self-fulfilling belief that `women can't do this, women can't do that.\\"<br /><br />Sheryl also provides some valuable advice that is good for everyone, not just women, such as:<br /><br />- \\"We each have to chart our own unique course and define which goals fit our lives, values, and dreams.\\"<br /><br />- \\"Authentic communication is not always easy, but it is the basis for successful relationships at home and real effectiveness at work.\\"<br /><br />- \\"Emotion drives both men and women and influences every decision we make. Recognizing the role emotions play and being willing to discuss them makes us better managers, partners, and peers.\\"<br /><br />Like Sheryl, I also believe more women in leadership will change the workforce and increase pay and other equality. So why, then, if I think this book is so truthful and great did I give it four stars?  It's because:<br /><br />- The author pits men against women and in today's society we should be beyond that approach.  Yes, what she states is true in many cases; however, I shun stereotypes and prejudices when I can so that they do not become a self-fulfilling prophesy.  For example, many years ago I witnessed a woman walk into a packed meeting room who had an impressive and very intellectual and powerful presence.  I said to myself \\"This is someone I would love to know.\\" She appeared to be very sure of herself and exuded high self-esteem.  I found out she was a lawyer.  However, at every meeting, she told the audience how she was discriminated against because she was black.  Although, it may have been true, after the third meeting with her all I could see was that she was \\"black\\" and her powerful appearance and impressiveness were lost to me. I did not even notice she was black when I first met her. I no longer had a desire to know her because she could not see past the discrimination.  In my opinion if people treat you differently because you are a woman, or black, or Chinese then find someone who will respect you for who you are.  By making it a mission to point out the stereotypes, I believe it leads to a self-fulfilling prophesy that you will be discriminated against.<br /><br />- Sheryl also does not broach the subject that different opportunities exist for different people, thereby limiting how far someone can go depending on if they are very poor or lack any support system.<br /><br />- Sheryl also does not make the case that a woman's will to lead may be hindered by genetics or cultural differences.  Yes, we can strive to overcome them and we should strive to overcome them, but it is not only about men versus women.<br /><br />If Sheryl focused more on her story instead of perpetuating the underlying male and female stereotypes, I would have given this book five stars.<br /><br />Here is my advice to both women and men alike:<br /><br />- Cultivate an incredible passion for more than one area of your life and move forward with an urgency others do not comprehend.  Life is like dinner on a plate with entr&eacute;es and sides; if one only has an entr&eacute;e (let's say it is work) and that disappears, then there is nothing left to sustain you. It's important to have balance where possible (family, friends, pets, work, hobbies, volunteer activities, church, travel, etc.), so that when one area of life fails, the other area supports the weight.<br /><br />- Live nothing but an honorable life and adopt the motto \\"be good to yourself and others\\" and \\"remember you are making memories, so make them good ones.\\"<br /><br />- Have faith in yourself.  Believe \\"you can\\" and if ever you think \\"you can't,\\" say to yourself \\"I can\\" until you actually believe it.  In essence, be your own best cheerleader. You are what you believe.  If you think you can't, you won't; if you think you can you will.<br /><br />- Be an optimist; pessimism only brings you down.<br /><br />- Don't let others tell you what is best for you as you know they are looking at your situation from their own reality. Take their advice if you think it is good advice but only after you evaluate what effect that advice will have on you.<br /><br />- Do not let naysayers get you down.<br /><br />- Seize any opportunity that is in your best interest.<br /><br />- Whatever you do, DON'T QUIT! Success is failure in disguise and as mentioned in the \\"Don't Quit\\" poem \\"many a failure turns about, when he might have won had he stuck it out.\\"<br /><br />- Remember you can't change anyone but yourself, so accept what you cannot change but work to change yourself when needed and embrace that change.<br /><br />- Finally, realize that stereotypes do exist, but do not give in to them.  You can rise above that. About 15 years ago a male colleague asked me to jumpstart his car because I had the cables to do so and he really did not know how. Had I \\"leaned in\\" to the stereotypes I doubt he would have had the courage to ask me for help.<br /><br />After reading this book, I can honestly say I would not do anything differently.  I'll continue to jumpstart my own car but will also continue to tell my boyfriend he was born with the \\"barbecue gene,\\" not because he really was but because I do not to like inhaling the smoke from the grill.o overcome them and we should strive to overcome them, but it is not only about men versus women.<br /><br />If Sheryl focused more on her story instead of perpetuating the underlying male and female stereotypes, I would have given this book five stars.<br /><br />Here is my advice to both women and men alike:<br /><br />- Cultivate an incredible passion for more than one area of your life and move forward with an urgency others do not comprehend.

B00AQA94M4|1.0|This record does not reach the levels of previous avantasia releases, unfortunately. Guitar riffs are clearly less powerful and fast, orchestral composition is not as good as previous ones too, various songs in the album are sadly boring. Good songs are only two and as usual the best one is that on Michael Kiske in vocals, and talking about vocals .... Sammet voice sounds kind of forced to reach the tone in most songs.<br />After listen a couple of times the entire album, not a song is remarkable, no way to compare this with scarecrow even same formula is applied. I can recommend all avantasia albums except this one. I cannot recommend to buy.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Awesome.  Other than the Wheel of Time this is the best fantasy series of our time. Looking forward to the next book.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|Ok story, not what I expected. Gratuitous female nudity in the beginning turned me off. Denzel gave great performance as always!
B000W9DSVW|5.0|Filled with an all star cast, there's no way that these movies can't be good. After seeing Oceans 11, I was hooked. The quality is the same kind of quality you would come to expect from Blu Ray, flawless. I may have seen some errors like pixelated shades of black during dark parts of the movie, but I'm assuming it's only because I was using a cheaper kind of TV. But packaging and shipment was great, items arrived on time and were brand new and still in wrappers. These made an overall good experience in watching these movies.

0312427565|4.0|When World War Two was over, the American Air force started to work with jet planes. Planes the were faster, more agile, and had more altitude. The Cold War was heating up when in 1957. The Russian launched Sputnik 1 into space. This set the Americans on a small edge. The American government was afraid the Russians would put nuclear weapons in space and launch them at America. So the U.S. decided to start their own space program. Only America wanted to put people in space. The Mercury Project was established and was indented to train and put people in space. The Astronauts were selected based on their aviation history with rocked planes. Then the candidates would be brought to a facility to be tested on to see if they were capable enough to be shot into space(did they have to right stuff). The seven astronauts were selected and mission started. The American space program was slow and by the time one capsule was working the Russians had launched many more. The program was finally successful when Alan Shepard went into space and when John Glenn orbited earth. The book introduces struggles that NASA and America overcame to go to space.<br /><br />There were many things that I liked about this book. The way the author describes the setting makes you feel as if you were there in the early 1960's with them. I really enjoyed reading this book because it explain a lot of the behind the stage astronaut activity not many know about. I was very interesting to learn about the tests and struggles the pilots had to go through to became astronauts. One of the only things that I didn't like about the book was the fact that the \\"story\\" did not really carry out. The book only focused on a six year period from 1957-63. There is no doubt in my mind that these were very significant years in the space race, but the book didn't mention the moon landing I really did enjoy this book though. There were not really any themes or messages in this book because it was a non-fiction book.<br /><br/>If anyone is interested in space of history this would be a great book for them. Since this boo;k is about the space race it is focused on America's retaliation to Russia's launch of Sputnik 1. This book is about America building a space program and trying to bet Russia to space. If you ire into history this would also be a good book for you. This book is filled with historical information. The book takes place in 1957-1963. During the Cold War many historical space events occurred. The heat was on as Russia and America went heat to head in a battle for the stars. So if your into history or space, This would be a great book for you.

Delete a few songs and add a few into the mix from the bonus tracks which are killer as well. And if you can't come up with a 45-minute MASTERPIECE that excites you as much as Violator you need to hang it up.

B004JN1D2I|3.0|George R.R. Martin, who wrote this wordy saga is, indeed, a man of great mystery.  On the one hand he has an array of excellent writing skills but, on the other, we, as readers, are sometimes left with a very foul taste in our mouths from some of the misadventures he has led us into.  He, like all of us, has some very notable abilities while some of his efforts remain questionable.  Let me first start by defining his skills.  In a manner that is similar to Charles Dickens or Harper Lee, some of his scene descriptions can literally leave the reader breathless.  You find yourself immersed in his fictional world smelling that scents of the lilies, being lost in the overshadowing forests or marching through snowdrifts that strain and nearly break every muscle in your body.  His character developments are, likewise, very well done and fluctuate or grow with the ever changing storyline.  We shiver at the grotesqueness of the imp, recoil from the cut-throat killers, while marveling at the personal evolution of the maimed character who is simply called `the Kingslayer'.  Lastly, his storyline, while becoming bogged down on occasion, does keep the reader moving forward and wanting to turn the next page, even though there are many, many to turn.<br /><br />The rest of his writing style, as said earlier, does leave a series of unanswered questions that the readers with a high level of curiosity may want a reply to.  Some of these are as follows:<br /><br />Why does he continue to show that evil is the eternal victor over good?  I am certain that one of the author's goals was to go against the popular fairy tale bent that shows that good always overcomes evil and that everyone lives happily ever after.  But, the author, in this case, shows that integrity and honor are actually weaknesses that must be overcome in order to merely survive in the world before us.  In a manner of the roots of the ancient Christian dogma of `original sin', our faults of our sins, however, should be magnified to the point and not diminished.  In order to thrive in the disruptive world we live in one should not only not overcome our inner nature but to hone it to a sharpened point and, after doing so, use it to fulfill your selfish and narcissistic desires. We, and only we, are responsible for gaining all that we can in both power and wealth.  We should grasp it tightly such that it, too, is not ripped from our hands by someone else.<br /><br />Why are women viewed in the subordinate and destructive roles that he portrays them in?  The era in which this fictional tale takes place is around the time of the War of the Roses and, being so, women in this time period were viewed as being of second quality to the protectorate and dominant males.  But, that being said, there are no mature females in this storyline who do not have innate faults of their own that lead to their own demise irregardless of the the male influence around them.  Could it be that the author, himself, is plagued by a long-standing unsuccessful male/female relationships and this is his outlet to show the anger he harbors against them?  Or does he simply continue to view women with a Dark Ages perspective of inequality and misogynism?<br /><br />Why does the author incessantly flood the readers with countless names of characters who never fully enter the story line?  While each of us, in our own lives, have had countless numbers of persons pass in and out, the number of characters that the author gives us, at times, is staggering and unnecessary.  It may have been helpful to the readers if he had placed and asterix next to the ones who would reappear at a latter time and needed our immediate attention.  It is tiring to keep flipping back into this onerous text to refresh our memories about someone who we initially deemed as trivial.<br /><br />Why does this story  proceed at such a glacial pace and with never seeming to have a clearly defined horizon to head towards?  While this does give the author the opportunity to sell more and more books from his ever expanding series, I am wondering if this is also reflective of his own life.  Could it be that his life, like the series  itself, has little direction, have no on-going pleasures to enjoy or that he feels that life steers and directs him instead of he leading life to where he wishes it to go?<br /><br />Why are the only characters who are able to maintain a high level of morality and integrity depicted as being only children?  While it nearly too simplistic to say that only as adults did enough time pass in our lives to corrupt us to the core, this may, in fact, be too shallow of a reason.  It may actually be that the author only sees the ones who have no power, the children, the peons, etc..., as being the only ones who have any chance of having and holding onto virtuous principles.  Could this be said of our society also?  Are the truly corrupt persons the ones who have achieved social ranking while the only ones who have integrity are the ones at society's bottom rung and are satisfied to stay there?<br /><br />And finally, what does the intermittent magic that is shown in this series symbolically depict?  I project that this is the portion of life Martin shows that few, if any, of us have any control over.  This represents the things that `come out of no where' and destroy the paths that we have set before ourselves.  Do prayer, fasting or penance cease their existence in this author's viewpoint?  Hardly.<br /><br />My projection for book #6 (or 7 or 8 or 9, etc...) is that only the  most swarthy of the characters will be left standing.  All virtue, all goodness and certainly all purity will have vanished from the author's printed page.  But what will the moral and/or purpose of this series then be?  Absolutely nothing for this author is not a person who is guided by nor lives by a sense of morality.  Instead, he simply sees power, greed and lust as being the driving force behind humanity and that the end of society, as we have known it, is actually drawing near.<br /><br />Let us remember as critical readers that because something is labeled as being `popular' in no manner means that it is good, quality writing anymore than when something is labeled as being `old' means that it can be deemed an ancient classic.  These tags are generally placed there because of a mindless herd mentality of the reading public and/or the genius of the corporate marketing gurus.  The most insightful and revealing writings that we can experience are generally never given either the label of popular nor classical.  In order to be find these unique creations, however, one must look deep into the niches of the corner used-book store.  They are generally the ones with the less-read and have the newer bindings............r the opportunity to sell more and more books from his ever expanding series, I am wondering if this is also reflective of his own life.  Could it be that his life, like the series  itself, has little direction, have no on-going pleasures to enjoy or that he feels that life steers and directs him instead of he leading life to where he wishes it to go?<br /><br />Why are the only characters who are able to maintain a high level of morality and integrity depicted as being only children?  While it nearly too simplistic to say that only as adults did enough time pass in our lives to corrupt us to the core, this may, in fact, be too shallow of a reason.

Are the truly corrupt persons the ones who have achieved social ranking while the only ones who have integrity are the ones at society's bottom rung and are satisfied to stay there?<br /><br />And finally, what does the intermittent magic that is shown in this series symbolically depict?  I project that this is the portion of life Martin shows that few, if any, of us have any control over.  This represents the things that `come out of no where' and destroy the paths that we have set before ourselves.  Do prayer, fasting or penance cease their existence in this author's viewpoint?  Hardly.<br /><br />My projection for book #6 (or 7 or 8 or 9, etc...) is that only the  most swarthy of the characters will be left standing.  All virtue, all goodness and certainly all purity will have vanished from the author's printed page.  But what will the moral and/or purpose of this series then be?  Absolutely nothing for this author is not a person who is guided by nor lives by a sense of morality.  Instead, he simply sees power, greed and lust as being the driving force behind humanity and that the end of society, as we have known it, is actually drawing near.<br /><br />Let us remember as critical readers that because something is labeled as being `popular' in no manner means that it is good, quality writing anymore than when something is labeled as being `old' means that it can be deemed an ancient classic.  These tags are generally placed there because of a mindless herd mentality of the reading public and/or the genius of the corporate marketing gurus.  The most insightful and revealing writings that we can experience are generally never given either the label of popular nor classical.  In order to be find these unique creations, however, one must look deep into the niches of the corner used-book store.  They are generally the ones with the less-read and have the newer bindings............
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I love this case for my Kindle Fire. It is light weight which is exactly what I wanted. It holds the device snugly and the strap works great.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Just a great movie!!! Must watch for all ages. Full of laughter and fun for everyone. Everyone should add this movie to their collection even if you aren't a fan of animated films.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|All you have to do is sit down with the kids and watch this movie one time.  My 2 girls wore out 2 VHS versions of this movie and one DVD.  They knew every word by heart and loved it.  It would still hold their attention even today because the story is good vs evil and the heroes are so loveable.  I made them watch Legend with Tom Cruise to even it out, so dad wouldn't go nutty from watching Willow too much.  This movie is a 10 out of 10 for kids.  Might seem silly to adults but kids dig this stuff.  For Boys I might get this and Titan AE.  I shoved an 5 year old that was helping his dad work on my water heater.  DAD, DAD, DAD, I want to help!  I put Star Wars in and he didn't even pay attention.  I put in Titan AE and he was 5 inches from the screen staring up at it the whole time but I am betting Willow would be just as good for the little sprout.  Get it, you cant go wrong!
073934353X|5.0|I had seen the movie many times and enjoyed it always.<br />Then a friend loaned me the book and it was so much more than the movie; more substance and information.<br />It told me more about the rest of the people and their lives and how they lived, like Big George and his family.<br />So I ordered the book on CD from Amazon, but it left out these extra details.<br />So the paper back book was the best by far.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|not bad as this type of game goes.  easy to use. n semi addictive.  some repetitive stuff if u don't want to buy pearls. etc.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I discovered Lindsey on YouTube with her video for Crystallize. I haven't been able to stop listening since. I love her blend of violin with drum beats or dubstep. I really love her original work on this album, though her covers of Lord of the Rooms and Zelda are really good as well. All in all an enjoyable album.

B00AIUUXHC|5.0|To be honest, I don't often like games that are free to play but give you many opportunities to pay real money for things in-game. It's reasonable for a developer to want to earn money off its games, but often such games more or less force you to pay for things to fully play or enjoy the games. In the worst cases, this leaves a game a soulless shell of itself for those that don't pay into it, and makes it feel less LIKE a game and more just a way for the developer to extort money from people.<br /><br />Fortunately, Hungry Shark Evolution is one of the few to do this type of game model CORRECTLY. :3<br /><br />Sure, you can pay money to buy things in this game, to give yourself a quicker edge, and if you want to support this game's team. But you don't HAVE to. Everything in this game (from what I can tell) can be purchased using the money you earn in-game, as well as with real money. It takes a bit longer doing it the 'free' way, sure, but that's quite okay when you have a game this fun. :)<br /><br />This game has some repetition to it, but the gameplay and sense of progression keeps it well away from being boring or tedious. Your shark gains exp and levels up, getting stronger, and you can further upgrade your attributes as well. Level up a shark fully and you unlock the next - which starts out weaker than your previous, powered-up shark, but also has the potential to be even better than your previous shark. Round this out with additional items and upgrades that you can use, and you have a very solid model of progression and reward.<br /><br />The gameplay itself is simple yet addictive. Directing your shark towards things for it to eat on contact is very simple, and aside from a handy boost function it's all that you need to worry about as far as controls go, so it's easy to pick up and play. But the game itself is very hard to master. There's plenty of challenge throughout the vast ocean environment, plenty to see, do, and devour! You can do combos, find and complete missions, find treasure, and way more. Even better, the environment and its fauna seems to be subtly different for each shark, which keeps things fresh as well as always providing challenges and surprises.<br /><br />This review's gone on long enough, though. To summarize? This is a fantastic, fun game. This is the first time I've played a game of this sort and actually wanted to purchase things with real money. Not because of necessity (there isn't any :3), but because I want to support the developers of this well-designed game.plete missions, find treasure, and way more.

B004JZBGWI|5.0|This app was the most used on my Kindle Fire HD. It was neat and organized, allowing me to arrange notes in any way I chose.<br /><br />Then it faltered. It started having problems such as slow type response time, the scroll feature freezing, to freezing altogether. Mind you, I uninstalled and reinstalled several times before I eventually gave up and got the Notebooks app, instead. It works good, but it lacks the scroll feature that ColorNote had.<br /><br />Not sure what caused it to fall apart, but it is a shame. It was a really good app.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/6/2017<br /><br />Since many updates have passed, I feel compelled to update the review. I don't use this so much on my Kindle anymore, but it has taken a permanent residence in 3 phones I've owned since then. I have yet to have an issue with this app on either of the 3 phones, and it currently has been used for things such as groceries, notes, quick thoughts, etc. It is a popular app that I use quite often, and become a staple on my phone.
B008JFUO36|5.0|I can't figure why Katy Perry is Smurfette. She's a brunette. Doesn't make any sense. Smurfette is blonde.  Duh!  Anyway, Oblivion is a really cool movie!  It's like 50 First Dates with lasers!  Thanks, filmmakers!
0765325950|5.0|Amazing series, amazing book. I was devastated when I heard Jordan passed away, and I would never be able to read his work again. I was skeptical about reading the last 3 from Sanderson's hand, because I had read part of a series from a different author before (and it was horrible, couldn't read it), but I am absolutely astounded at how well he did these last 3 in the series and I can't even tell another author finished it (yes, Jordan DID have notes for the final book ready, and Sanderson worked with Jordans son). Must read.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|I love musicals and this puts a twist on it with the mash ups and comedy! You'll definitely be singing along, dancing in your seat and laughing if you watch Pitch Perfect!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Really? What was all the that?<br />It took me forever to read it. It was like a teen age girl fantasy.
B001TM14VC|5.0|The movie was the hit of it's day (in the 1980's).<br /><br />It is still as relevent and appropriate today, as it<br />was then.
B007RCJNDE|5.0|After many year we had finally reached the end of this series. It was very good and I could not hazard a guesss at the outcome.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Just an excellent read.  It's hard to put down.  I'm a big fan of the TV show, and the book is a great way for me to catch all the little details.
B0040HJNKC|4.0|I really like all but 3 tracks on this album. 74 Years Young, Thank Me Someday, and Living Proof are my favorites off it.
B003719G40|5.0|I will recommend this book for anyone who wants to have good relationship. I also called this book an anti-divorce. Great Job.
B008Y1YFOE|4.0|I really like a couple of songs, but the majority just doesn't do enough for me. Where Did the Angels Go is what made me buy it, plus the fact that I own other Papa Roach cds that I really like.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|This book I us awesome, had to watch the series on blu-ray couldn't get enough of the gladiator and all its many twist
1433288435|5.0|Great story about the human condition.  Reading performance was incredible added a great deal to the story. I highly recommend this audiobook.  The voice talent was phenomenal.
B008SOS63S|5.0|This CD quickly became one of my all time favorites. The sound quality is fantastic, especially considering it was a live performance. Joe is just an incredible musician and his band is equally as good.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|This story kept you wanting to know more and kept you fighting for the characters. It will make you think about what would really happen if the flares actually occurred.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best and has great tunes<br />I thought that it was really really fun<br /><br />Loved I f2f so much lollipop<br />Lol
B000FCKIFU|5.0|A very good book and I plan on downloading each book of the series. Then read each one. I just enjoy reading David Baldacci very much.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Could not be easier to install and works great on my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and Amazon Kindle HD 9 and all as a free program. I have run it with both my desktop and laptop.
B00A7KKPDK|3.0|Knowing and loving Ellen Degeneres, I was somewhat disappointed with this novel. While it does contain her lighthearted, goofy voice, the book was a slow read. I was under the impression she was writing it purely for money so sacrificed the quality because of guaranteed sales. This book sounds like something she wrote when she was waiting to get a filling at a dentist's office - just something to kill time. However, because she's adorable and good-hearted, and many of her \\"lessons\\" to us are admirable, I gave it a few stars.
B009EE1GC4|4.0|No car chases here. But there are a few moments that will touch you, especially if you or a loved one is trying to navigate retirement or late life decisions.
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|Adam Grant backs up usable information for self analysis/awareness with broad based research.  Rare in business related books.  I have reviewed it twice in blogs on my website. drlindalmoore.com<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for someone who really wants to understand self and others.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Easy to connect.  Lightning fast - even over 3G.  Works wonderfully on both protocols.<br /><br />Those of you getting it as a FAOTD are lucky!  Awesome app.
B000NY12LO|5.0|Oh another Jodi book to add to my list of loved books. This book was disturbing yet it kept me wanting more to get down to the details and how and why something so tragic could happen. I loved how Jodi gives multiple characters point of views. It leaves me to be able to see all sides of this story! Highly suggest!
B007EECSFA|3.0|The story felt disjointed as the author told us the main character's story in the past and present. I also didn't like that the daughter investigating her mother's past made assumptions about what had happened in the past--all to advance the plot. The book made for an interesting book club discussion, though. The ending &#34;redeemed&#34; the book and made me like it more.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is very interesting I highly recommend this game this game is great for kids you should but it and it's free wow
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a great!! I play it, and my family loves it. Kids up to adults would enjoy the fun. There is awesome challenges and you can connect with your friends through social media to get some clean and fun competition going. This is a really good game!
B0070DOHQS|1.0|All I get is gibberish on my Nexus 7 so can't even try it to review it.  Other desktopshave worked without issues.  I did try to uninstall and then reinstalled just in case of a bad download. But alas same problem.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was amazing. The characters may have been a bit to perfect but I actually liked it that way. It made it seem more glamorous and fantasy like. I almost cried when I got to the end because I didn't want it to be over. Can't wait to read the next book.
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|Decent action movie that was better than just &#34;it's okay&#34;. More like a 7.5/10. I'm probably not a great critic - a movie usually has to be pretty bad for me not to be entertained. So I tend to rate somewhat higher than most. Essentially, it's okay if I want to see the end - even if I know how it will end.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I gave it five star because pixar always does an amazing job when it comes to the visual. Many people didn't like the movie I've heard and at points it did feel a little off because  of the story line but it was not boring it still had pixar great effort but like I said the visual in blu ray was just amazing it felt real just how the ocean in finding memo looked so real same with brave. Pixar never fails when it comes to making films, brave keeps you laughing and entertain.
B002CSC5EC|5.0|I saw this when it was released & multiple times since. I love concert films & this one is the ultimate. Want to know what it was like in the 60's & the under-30 crowd? Watch this film.
B004V546IW|5.0|wish I had gotten this book as hard cover instead of e-reader as there were pictures etc that I would have liked to had in hard copy. Good book though. Was great reading interview words from the entire group.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Characters are wonderful. Cinematography is wonderful .Love the special effects. Have watched it several times. Highly recommend for an enchanting story.
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|I think this is a great CD! Wish it had a book included as per usual with bon jovi CDs but there was a poster page whicih was nice. Their new CD/sound is just great. I love more and more everytime I listen to it. Bon Jovi continues to ROCK!
0739350463|3.0|I hope it was just a fluke, but<br />My disks all had numerous skips toward the end.<br />Other story disks I've bought did not do this.<br />The narrator is excellent & I'd buy more with him reading. Nothing is abridged or left out.<br />Enjoyed listening to the first half of each disk but then got very frustrated when the skipping started.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|This is a great product.  The only downfall is the wire is too long.  Easily tangles.  Otherwise great sound and quality.
B0065UF2ZM|4.0|This is the first book I have read by Michael Connelly and I will be reading more!<br />I would recommend this book and author to anyone who enjoys a good murder/mystery featuring good characters.
B006CHML4I|3.0|I like this watch a lot but it is not completely automatic.  It will not stay running when it off my wrist overnight, so then I have to set it every morning to get it going again.  Maybe it should have included a winding box with it when purchased.................This an update.  I am still looking for a winding box to fix the rundown problem.............
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Addictive game. Wish I would have came up the idea of Angry Birds. Wish they would update to add more levels.
B004I744AS|5.0|I now have a daily routine of:<br />1- learning a new word<br />2- article of the day<br />3- quote of the day<br />4- this day in history<br />5- today's birthday<br />6- in the news<br />7- weather<br />8- spelling bee<br />9- match up (this is a good one, match the 5 words in the list with its synonym)
B002ZG974M|5.0|Hello all,<br />I would recommend this movie to all, and people like me,<br />who are students in a 'Child Development Course.'<br /> And the Babies are so Adorable! Fun to watch!<br />Thank you,<br /><br />Don McKinley [ 69 year old College Student ]
B0063GORYU|4.0|I am constantly playing this game and would frequently replay the same deal until getting the solution.  The format is wonderful.
B000V8A95C|4.0|I downloaded this a long time ago and... it somehow got lost, or deleted.  While it's not something I listen to every day, it is something I like to have in my collection.
B005DKLPQ0|5.0|Even though it's not technically the &#34;complete&#34; Smiths, you'd be hard pressed to find a more thorough and beautifully packaged collection by this seminal band.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Loved the movie. I bought 2 -- one for me and one for my daughter. We both loved the movie! There was a lot of singing, but it isn't a &#34;musical&#34;. Very good.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Maybe a younger group would like this better. I didn't dislike the movie just not my type. Not sure I would watch another sequel.
034580404X|5.0|My best friend retired from the organization we work for after 30 years of service. She's an avid reader...so as part of her Retirement Gift from me....I had this set sent to her home. I put a note in her retirement gift package I gave her at the office party that said &#34;The BEST is yet to come...expect arrival at your home within 10 days.&#34; She had NO IDEA what she was getting -- could've been a stripper for all she knew! She absolutely LOVED the books and read all 3 within 4 days!! Then read them again!
B005FVNIW6|1.0|Maybe the most overrated novelist ever. Characters are insular and uninspired, there are much better alternative authors to pick from.
1557048630|5.0|This was a really great read. The art work was well done. I think this would make a great book for readers of any age.
B007RCJNDE|3.0|The first 5 books in the series were amazing, and then Robert Jordan just made it too complex. Because of the complexity the story hardly moved forward in the next 5 novels. Brandon Sanderson did a great job of cleaning up the loose ends though.
B00BF11STU|3.0|My gentleman friend said it was very interesting.  I had a very long week so could not make it to the end of the movie.  He said it was OK
0425252868|5.0|Terrific book of real life people. Very inspring and proves that not all Germans were Nazi lovers. Excellent reading and well written.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|I have read most of the Jack Reacher books and really enjoy them.  I was not sure how Tom would do in this part.  But he did well.  they kept all the one liners from the book.  My gentlemen friend had never read any of the books and he really enjoyed it too!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This was a beautiful movie.  It held my kid's attention, as well as my own.  I highly recommend it as a family film.
B0094M4R3Q|3.0|My grandson is 6 and it was too much for him yet.  Only let him watch about 20 minutes then turned it off.
B000JCQCW4|2.0|just too weird for my taste and the situations too exaggerated. i.e., the boy in the ER with a horrible infection of the arm being sent to prison and never treated pushed their point in to much of an exaggerated way. would never happen like that.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Oh boy oh boy oh boy. Man this book was great, for all ages and genders. This has been one if not the favorite series I've picked up
B00BF123WG|3.0|Sorry but she just isn't a good film director. She makes gritty, realistic stories into silver screen experiences; but you don't walk away from her movies feeling the joy of cinema. You simply feel emotionally exhausted.
B00CAJP0ZO|3.0|Same tone for several songs. You can do better will.  I liked the duets. Good music I can use for running
B000IHL51S|3.0|The story content would feed the imagination of young people with its emphasis on superhuman efforts by one individual, gifted in so many different ways.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|This is where fantasy becomes so real----you actually have fun watching it! Normally, I love the books but am disappointed by the movie. Not in this case!
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Maroon 5 is either a love 'em or hate 'em band.  If you don't like Adam Levine's voice, go for something else.  This is my current go to album for anything that requires motivation to get through.  &#34;Lucky Strike&#34; is my last lap song.  It is absolutely impossible to not kick it in to high gear when that track play.  There is no track that I skip but several that I repeat.
B003O86FMW|4.0|i'm not a huge fan of the series but i'll continue reading just to finish what i started. i did like the &#34;wtf is happening&#34; ending.
B008602KQI|4.0|So I didn't read the books (yet) but watched the movie when I was sick in bed. I guess having not read the books I really had a hard time getting over the whole concepts of the kids killing kids as part of the game. I think recent news worthy events have created that mentality that is still so fresh in our minds. I will see the next movie in the series (and hope to finally read the books). I do love Jennifer Lawrence....she really is a class act and so true to herself.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|the book was ok. i liked the characters well enough to continue with the series. not my favorite but i'm glad i read it.
B0050AV5MW|4.0|Takes some time to get into this story, characters are many & varied and take time to know & learn. Very uncompromising writing but eloquent and descriptive. MARTIN has built a very credible and detailed world.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|Really wasn't as good as I expected . But I'll voice it a three star. But you should try it yourself.
0670024813|4.0|When we look at the full timescale of humankind on earth, civilizations as we know them are relatively new inventions, so when we look at traditional hunter-gatherer societies, we're looking at \\"the world until yesterday,\\" according to Jared Diamond. As in his previous books, Guns, Germs and Steel and Collapse, Diamond is thinking about a broad range of societies scattered throughout the globe, but unlike those books, the societies under the lens are the smallest ones we know- many of them are made up of small bands of 20 people or so. When we learn about these people, which Diamond acknowledges is always a tricky proposition, we can look back to before agriculture, cities, and iPhones had reprogrammed us in their image. Diamond has spent a good deal of time with the people of Papua New Guinea, and his personal experiences make up a great deal of his storytelling, giving the book a personal touch not evident in his earlier book. What we have is a fascinating window into a world that is at once completely alien to a Western city dweller and also fully human, with the opportunity to see what has been lost along the way, and what we should be glad to have left behind.<br /><br />Diamond looks specifically at things such as conflict resolution and warfare, the raising of children and care for the elderly, health, attitudes toward risk, language and bilingualism, and religion. In each area, he shows a wide range of traditional approaches, such as the massive variation between societies where the elderly are revered leaders and those where they are killed or left to die once they become a dangerous burden on the group. His approach is even-handed, and he avoids both romanticizing traditional life, which is often harsh and dangerous, and trumpeting westernized progress, which has brought its own set of health problems and anxieties. Instead, his goal is to look at what we can learn, or in a sense rediscover, from these societies, such as the idea of bringing more mediation-type meetings into the legal system, or seeing how traditional diets protect against a host of western health problems, such as diabetes and heart disease. On the flip side, he points out how modern societies, with the government having a relative monopoly on violence, tend to have lower homicide rates due to there being fewer revenge killings. You win some, you lose some.<br /><br />The book can be a bit fact-stuffed at times, eschewing narrative for lists of definitions, and some will wish he talked more about the ever-problematic and often violent intersections between traditional and modern societies, but for those interested in what the world was like until not to long ago, and how it still is for many small groups of people today, it provides an often fascinating view with plenty for us to learn.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|This game is very cool and awesome. You can compete with your friends in challenging tournaments and, just like all Angry Birds games, is very entertaining.
159514188X|5.0|This is the first audio book I've listened to outside of school assignments, so please bear with me; it has colored my perception of the book more than I thought it would.<br /><br />Jay Asher has crafted a compelling story here, I'll give him that. I did NOT want to stop listening once I started. Though he sometimes went overboard with in-depth descriptive details that pulled me out of the story, most of it was very readable.<br /><br />Clay. Oh, Clay. Clay is a fantastic character. As he listened to Hannah's tapes, he responded in a very real way, often matching my own reactions as a reader--anger, annoyance, frustration, disbelief, helplessness. More and more as time went on, I found I was more invested in his journey than in Hannah's because I could identify with him. I liked him. Some of the credit for this goes to Jay Asher's writing and some of it to the voice actor. He was phenomenal. I can't imagine a more perfect reading. Clay's one-liners also provide brief, welcome reprieves of humor as he responds to the earlier stories on the tapes. Seriously, I laughed out loud more than once, which isn't something I was expecting in a book about suicide.<br /><br />Hannah is a much more divisive character, as a quick read through some of these reviews will tell you. Let me say I don't doubt the emotional journey--or roller coaster--that she went on at all. Though her reactions seem overdone to me as an adult, I remember everything seeming like a big deal in high school, so it makes sense. I do question her decision to make those tapes. It is well established that she put a lot of thought into those tapes, taking the time to visit all these places, create maps, work out a contingency plan if people failed to pass them along. As a very introspective girl who is desperate for love, it seems like she also would have thought about the effect those tapes would have on their recipients. ***SPOILERS*** For example, letting Jessica find out about her rape through a tape is bad enough. Having a handful of other people hear it first, and threatening the release of that information if the tapes don't get passed on? Cruel. ***END SPOILERS*** I know she's hoping they'll reflect on their actions and learn from them, but that doesn't give her carte blanche. With all of the thinking Hannah was doing about people and feelings and connections, you can't tell me she didn't know that her tapes might make people feel just as isolated, humiliated, and desperate as she did. This made it a difficult journey for me as a reader, because I wanted to commiserate with Hannah and couldn't. Maybe that was the point. I felt the same way about the voice actress as I did about the character. At times, I thought she nailed Hannah's sarcasm, pain, and vulnerability. At other times, she seemed a little too dramatic and a little too vindictive.<br /><br />What I decided in the end is, though Asher is telling Hannah's story, the book is really about Clay's journey, and Clay is an incredibly likable, relatable character. All in all, I enjoyed the book (as much as you can enjoy a book about suicide, that is). Due to the nature of the material, I'm inclined to think this is the quintessential audio book. If you're thinking about reading this book, I highly recommend you consider doing so in audio format.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very addicting game! I love it! It is so much fun. I highly recommend this game! It never ends and is easy to level up!

0307594009|5.0|The Diary of Anne Frank is a book about a 13 year old girl named Anne Frank who lived during the Holocaust. The book starts on Anne Frank's thirtenth birthday. In the book Anne Frank says that her favorite present was her diary.<br /> When Anne finds her diary on her birthday, she starts writing in it right away. Anne said that one day she would turn her diary into a book one day and call it, \\" The Dairy of Anne Fank \\". Anne Frank and her family were a Jewish family, so during the Holocaust it wasn't safe for them to stay in the house where the Nazis could easily find them and prison them in a concentration camp. The Holocaust is about a team of Naizs who are German and are against Jewish people and are wanting to prison them in a concentraion camp. A concentration camp is a prison for Jews. Before the Nazis could get to their home the Frank family moved to a Annex ( hiding place ) in Anne's fathers office. The Diary of Anne Frank is a biography made by Anne Frank and published by Frank ( Anne Frank's father).<br /> The book teaches you that even after you learn about the Holocaust, it isn't as easy as it sounds to be a Jew duing that time. When you think of yourself as Anne Frank in the book you find it really hard t believe. It is a amazing book o read. The rest is for you o read. Ages 15 and lower I would recommend a parent's permission before reading this book. Enjoy The Diary of Anne Frank!
0425252868|4.0|Makes one wonder why men have to be as wolves to other men. To read of the death toll at Gettysburg is heart-rending.
1400032717|4.0|In \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time\\", Christopher, a fifteen year old autistic mathematical genius finds his neighbor's dog suddenly dead in her front yard. (Does the title give it away?) Christopher looks up to his hero, Sherlock Holmes, and decides he will not only find out who murdered him, but to write a book about it as well. After a thorough questioning of his UK neighborhood, he starts uncovering things about his family's past. This leads him to find out dark secrets revolving his father and dead mother's relationship, and portrays how Christopher acts with the whole ordeal.<br />This book really shows us how a person with autism thinks and how they live, think and feel. While a little slow, the book shines in the fact of how close we get to Christopher with the author's fantastic use of character development. Another godsend is the author's attitude towards chasing dreams. Christopher always dreamt of being an astronaut or scientist despite his autism. He decides towards the end of the book that he shouldn't let that hold him back and plans on to peruse his incredible dream. This really hits home when reflecting on one's own life. We shouldn't let big or small inconveniences hold us back from achieving what we strive for, no matter what tries and stop you. Overall, this was a very good book. If you have the time and if you are looking for a pick-me-up mystery with a twist, I highly recommend \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time.\\" \\"Prime numbers are what is left when you have taken all the patterns away. I think prime numbers are like life. They are very logical but you could never work out the rules, even if you spent all your time thinking about them.\\"~Christopher
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I like the premise and enjoyed the characters but some some sections seems over done and therefore it lost momentum.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfer the different levels and the coin magnet is awesome and characters . You have to play the most popular game . Subway surfer.
B008D30K7E|5.0|The funniest book i have read in years, uplifting too. I would recommend it, as indeed it was recommend to me, great stuff!
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|Served as an excellent compliment to the movie.  I wonder what band will write the music for Kosinski's next.<br /><br />It draws on a handful of themes and mixes them enough so everything keeps feeling fresh.  While it's a bit derivative of other composers, it's still good.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Omg this was an amazing book<br />It had drama action journey it was soon cool I can't hardly wait for house of Hades

B0064MPXFA|5.0|Good story line, one of the best soap operas I've ever seen.  Smart, absorbing, and well worth watching. I love it.
B0070DOHQS|1.0|This is an outstanding VNC/RDP client.  I use it for VNC to a number of Linux systems.  It has an embedded ssh client for tunneling the connections, which works perfectly.  The only thing it is missing is public key login; as it is, the app remembers your ssh passwords, which is a security concern if the phone is lost.<br /><br />The VNC interface is one of the best I've seen, but with all of these apps, everyone will have a different opinion.  I suggest trying it out with the free version first (limited to just one host), and if you like it, buying the full version.<br /><br />One feature to be sure to take advantage of is the widgit.  Install the widgit on your screen (or in a folder), select an account, and you then just tap the widgit to connect to the account.<br /><br />Unfortunately the latest update 7.0(103) breaks the app.  Connections that were fine before now fail saying there's a host lookup failure.  Other apps connect to the same hosts without errors.
B002BKIERI|5.0|Great chanting and singing, such a beautiful voice! Powerful and uplifting.<br />I first heard this in my Kundalini yoga class.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey lives up to the hype.  The third season has some terrific episodes and overall the glimpse into the English class system is fascinating.  The acting is superb as advertised.

B000HEWEDK|5.0|This was great. I saw similarities in a Star Trek show. That was interesting too. But it was great seeing Leslie Nielsen playing a serious role.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I can't get this on my cable contract unless I pay extra so it's cheaper to buy the series and be able to w2atch when I want and as often as I want.  GREAT SERIES.  If you don't own it, buy it!!!!!!
B0070DOHQS|5.0|This app worked as described in the summary.  It was easily installed and worked the first time tried. Awesome App....worth the price.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|There were scary parts in this movie but the ending felt like there wasn't anything left to do so they just threw something together and called it good,
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I could not get into this game.  There was too much going on.  I probably need to take my time with it.
B006QPVH6O|1.0|alien rocks...really? If I didn't need to have a total of 18 words to submit this...it would only be the first part of this review.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Even though it is quite a bloodthirsty read, it does open your eyes to what was really going on in these tough and unforgiving places.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much I'm 16 years old man it's the only game I want to play!!! Everyone needs this game!!!!
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Very much the same-ish, but good on those days with your feet up and nothing much to do. I do enjoy them all.
B00947N6D8|5.0|This is a cute movie but the nightmare's are a little to scary for kids 5 & under. I loved the movie though
B004OR199G|4.0|Great humor with understanding how to change to Vegan eating.  Love her website too.  For anyone that wants to transition wonderful author. And I don't like to read books.
B004FP1WX0|3.0|Live Journalism is intriguing and filming something that many people in society participate in catches attention.  The film was someone allowing others to step into his personal space and capturing true reactions.
B0070DOHQS|3.0|I was getting this app to replace Splashtop because Splashtop no longer worked with my keyboard. The issue that I found is that if you use VNC, you cannot stream audio. The only way to stream audio is through RDP, and many computers don't come with RDP. Only the Professional and Ultimate editions of Windows comes with RDP, which means that you cannot stream audio if you do not have Windows Pro or Ultimate. I'm not sure what method Splashtop uses, but I can stream audio from all devices with Splashtop, which makes Splashtop all the better. Now I'm stuck between two: I can either hear audio but not use the keyboard with Splashtop, or use the keyboard but not hear audio with Jump.<br /><br />Apart from Audio, the FPS I get is on-par with Splashtop, both over Wi-Fi and data network. This is good because while Splashtop is open, Jump is encrypted. That probably means that if I did not use an encrypted connection, it would be a lot faster than Splashtop.<br /><br />But overall, the RDP-limited audio is a deal-breaker for me.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|At the moment I just have the free version and I think it gives you a lot for free. it keeps you going.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I tried the free app and liked it so much I decided to purchase the premium version. I LOVE it. There are so many sounds to mix together to make a custom mix  and each sounds volume can be individually adjusted. I love the bionomic tones too. I use this for sleeping and for studying. I use the timer at night, which is also able to be set for a custom length of time. The only change I would make is the timer. I wish I could set it to turn back on before I wake up.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I will keep this  book forever! The story, though fiction is based on true facts is the most delightful book I have ever read! This is a story of great redemption, sadness, lots of smiles, laughter, and truth of being human!! I wish everyone would read The Misremembered Man. I don't believe I have ever laughed aloud while reading a book!  Great author!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|You must start from season 1 and you need to pay attention. From someone used to speaking American English it was sometimes difficult to get their cadence and tone but after I did wow the dialogue is great. The characters superb. Would definitely recommend.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|Great season. Great series leaves you hanging Disappointing they didn't finish the series. Almost makes you want to find out where it would have gone
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|It's a Quentin Tarantino movie (and I'm a big fan of his), so of course it was a good flick. It wasn't his best movie, but I recommend it for any Tarantino fan.<br /><br />It doesn't possess the &#34;jumping around&#34; like Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs -- it's a little more mainstream. But it has that &#34;serious&#34; humor about it -- there are scenes where you think to yourself &#34;this is funny, but I don't know if I should laugh.&#34;<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of Jamie Foxx or Leonardo Dicaprio, but I really liked both in this movie -- especially Dicaprio.
1741797802|5.0|My wife and I are traveling to India in March 2014.  As neither have been there before, a comprehensive reference guide was paramount prior to leaving to ensure we best understood the country, customs, sights etc.  The LP India provided all of the information we sought - and more.  The commentary is well written, informative and the maps easy to read.  Any concerns we had have been allayed with this great resource. The contributors to the book did a splendid job, thoroughly recommended.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Draws you in right away. This book is a very unique story and I highly recommend that everyone should read it.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Good, clear graphics.  A fun way to pass the time in any &#34;waiting&#34; situation.  Especially like the &#34;pick up where left off&#34; option rather than losing the game and having to restart.  Recommend highly.

B00AF6MF9I|3.0|annoying. the game is good. but the game keeps saying no Internet access. for updates. always says allies or ennemie bases not accsessable.
B009CF7GRY|5.0|I really like this! It takes me back to my teen years and I really liked the music in it!  I liked it better then the one that was made 10 years ago. This version was a lot better!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Cute game, fun to play, fairly easy to advance and expand. A keeper!<br />My Mom plays too, how do I add her as friend if we don't have Facebook and don't want it?
B006CQLGXG|5.0|This is totally epic and I teased my brother saying that it sucked but I really loved it so poop
B00B4804KS|3.0|stick to the 2-D version. My Sony TV showed up all kinds of crosstalk and ghosting and it wasn't a pleasure to watch. I understand it's not the fault of the disc but of the TV/glasses.  I paid enough for that Sony last year that I wouldn't have thought to have this problem, but it's pretty prevalent throughout, as it is on Hugo.  If your set is like that, keep just enjoying the blu-ray 2D version.  What a disappointment!  I'm sure it looks fantastic on a decent set!
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|This is a WWll movie with a great twist.. The movie is taken from the point of view of a German U-boat crew. The fact. It was originally shot in German with English subtitles makes viewing more enjoyable. You get the sounds and smells of life on board (most of the crews' food was fresh and it got ripe along with the seamen. If you are claustrophpbic, youi might get squeamish, but it's a small price for a great viewing experience!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Great ending to an up and down series.  I can't put it down.  Makes me want to go back and re read the series.  Can;t say enough good things about it.

B00BIVN82M|5.0|If your looking at this than you must have heard one of Michael Buble's songs.  That's all you need to hear to be hooked.  I was when I first heard him.  I can only describe his voice and songs as audio sex.  It's like my ears have had an orgasm:) YES!! You should buy Michael Buble's \\"To Be Loved\\" album.  It does not disappoint.  The song \\"Close Your Eyes\\" is my personal favorite.  It was hard to choose, they're all so great! Helpful hint: Michael Buble's music is always a wonderful background sound when having sex or making love.  Very inspiring!
B00A72989U|5.0|What a great performer! Makes one wish they could sing half as powerfully as does Alicia Keys! The album is as enjoyable as the hit.

B008Y5OWSO|3.0|I had never seen the movie, but everything I had heard and read made it sound like the archetype for a stinker.  One of the worst movies of all time.  Then I saw it on a movie channel and wanted to own it.  It's way off historically, pitting poor emigrants against rich cattle barons (it didn't happen that way) but the movie is so well-filmed that I could overlook the historical inaccuracies.
0374531269|5.0|In March of 1991 a group of men who call themselves the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) began to attack villages in eastern Sierra Leone. Their goal is to get rid of the corrupt APC government. The fighting continued until January 2002 but between the time many children are thrown into the war becoming soldiers. Ishmael Bean, the author of the devastating but eye opening memoir, was a soldier for three years until UNICEF removed him. This heart wrenching horrific story shows the will to survive, that revenge isn't always the answer, and the tough road to redemption. This memoir opens the eyes of the reader by letting them know what is happening around the world and makes them realize how lucky they are to have their life. Several times though out the book Ishmael shows the reader that revenge leads to more trouble, how far one is willing to go to survive, and how one must learn to forgive their self. These three themes are captivating messages that are told in such a way that it makes the reader think of everything in their life and to make the best of it. This book make the reader realize how important family is and to keep them close because they won't be around forever. Also be thankful for everything that they have and to appreciate all the opportunities they're given. \\"One of the unsettling things about my journey, mentally, physically, and emotionally was I wasn't sure when or where it was going to end. I didn't know what I was going to do with my life. To survive each passing day was my goal in life. I was never disappointed since I always expected the worst to happen. I thought about where my family was and whether they were alive.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love the Walking Dead!!  Can't wait til season 4 comes out, hope it's great just like the other seasons have been.
1416585710|4.0|Oftentimes when a writer attempts to make the leap from one genre to another, they stumble or even crash and burn.  Sometimes the novelty of the book will attract readers, but all too often said book ends up lackluster or even bad.  And even if said book is actually pretty good, there will always be people who compare it to the author's previous works.  J.K. Rowling's recent foray into non-fantasy adult literature, \\"The Casual Vacancy,\\" is a prime example of such a book, as is James Patterson's various attempts at non-thriller romance with \\"Sundays at Tiffany's\\" and \\"Sam's Letters to Jennifer.\\"  Some still love these books despite them being atypical for the writers, but one's mileage may vary.<br /><br />When I picked up Stephen King's \\"Lisey's Story,\\" I had only two other King books under my belt (\\"Rose Madder\\" and \\"The Long Walk\\"), but I knew enough about his writing to know that this would be one of those atypical books -- not a straight horror book, but a love story.  But fans of King need not fear that the master of modern horror has turned into a Nicholas Sparks clone.  Despite being a bit \\"lighter and softer\\" than his usual fare, this book is still phenomenally well-written.<br /><br />The titular Lisey is Lisey Landon, widow of acclaimed author Scott Landon, who has quietly stood by his side and provided nearly invisible support throughout his career.  Their marriage was a strange one -- Scott struggled with a peculiar madness all his life, and it was only the love and support of Lisey, as well has his occasional trips to a private \\"alternate reality\\" he called Boo'ya Moon, that enabled him to keep it at bay.  Now, as she goes through his papers and cleans out his study, she finds she has more to grapple with than simply settling her late husband's estate -- the encroaching insanity of her own sister, and a deadly stalker who's transferred his obsession from Scott to Lisey in the wake of the author's death.  If Lisey is to save her sister -- and herself -- she must trust in the clues Scott has planted in his papers and her memory, and make the journey to Boo'ya Moon... and trust that the dangers of Boo'ya Moon won't be worse than her flesh-and-blood adversary.<br /><br />As always, King has a masterful way with words, and his writing is crisp and descriptive without being overly flowery.  He presents his characters in their unvarnished, warts-and-all glory, and as a consequence they feel like real people instead of simply caricatures or stereotypes.  The world of Boo'ya Moon, with its accompanying beauty and menace, feels brilliantly realized, a dreamscape that's familiar to anyone who has dreamed themselves, with its own rules and dangers.  And for those fearing the relationship part of this book will overwhelm everything else, don't fear -- there's still plenty of thrills and bumps in the night for the horror reader.  Maybe the stalker and the Long Boy (a creature of Boo'ya Moon) aren't quite as iconic as IT or Randall Flagg, but they represent the dark fears of both the real world and the dream world, and are all the more terrifying for it.<br /><br />The characters in this book seem especially close to his heart, and it's not a big stretch of the imagination to think that perhaps Lisey and Scott are symbolic of King and his wife, making this book a personal project and a sort of thank-you letter to his wife.  Sometimes I question whether it's appropriate for an author to pour his heart out into a published work like this, but here it makes for a heartfelt and gripping story.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book as a \\"stepping stone\\" for those who want to get into King's works but don't want to start with something super-horrifying.  It's not as chilling or bloody as his other classics, but it's a well-done book with just the right amount of menace and chills, and with a heartfelt story that's probably the closest Stephen King will ever come to writing a romance novel.  Well done, Mr. King.she must trust in the clues Scott has planted in his papers and her memory, and make the journey to Boo'ya Moon... and trust that the dangers of Boo'ya Moon won't be worse than her flesh-and-blood adversary.<br /><br />As always, King has a masterful way with words, and his writing is crisp and descriptive without being overly flowery.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Can't imagine what she went through....god bless her and her girls....take care .... Need more protection from people like these animals.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|What more can I say that has not been said already. I had never seen this movie but heard so much about it for a couple years, so I was curious. really glad I watched it, it was really good. I was a little disappointed in the end, I was expecting a little different emotion... it left me guessing and I hate that. I like to know &#34;WHAT HAPPENED&#34;....
B00APUYWYA|5.0|i absoooolutely love this movie. I always get the songs stuck in my head. the humor is  pretty funny too
B007W1BLN0|4.0|This movie was a message to so many people, on so many levels. It kept my attention thru out.  It was  a little disappointing in the end, that someone so open to the world, and so smart and intelligent and loving could be so freckin stupid. So I was bummed. but it was a good movie.
B00BG08FKK|4.0|I am living life to the soundtrack of Les Mis because my children will not turn it off.  It's a great collection of amazing music.
B007N85POS|4.0|I was hesitant to get this app at first. I'm happy I did get it. The graphics are great and, other than different images, it is exactly like the original version of the game. My daughter loves it.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I grew up with the original Star Trek and was a critic of every derivative, having to adjust to each new storyline and character set, but they grew on me. I've seen them all multiple times and will continue to do so. I approached this movie no differently... I was hooked in the opening scene by the outrageously aggressive and irrational bad guys, the quick and clear thinking Star Fleet officers and what I think is a wonderful new twist on an old theme involving black holes, time travel, revenge, and alternative timelines. The introduction and portrayal of key characters from the original series is awesome. the mix of drama, action, and comedy is masterful and some of my favorite movie moments are in this first of what i hope will be many movies cefining this prequel. How many installments we will get and where the writers will take is an open question, but I'm ready roll with it.

B0015DROBO|4.0|Definitely an entertaining novel. Somewhat graphic in parts, but a good read nonetheless. Eager to read the rest of the trilogy.

B008QTVNUI|5.0|From the 1st episode I was hooked; had to download the rest of the season right away! Still trying to figure out who are the good guys and the bad guys.  Can't wait for Season 2!
B007SPPANM|5.0|This film is great. It was very well made. Excellent Cast and a legendary<br />director. The Titanic in which the actors appeared looks very realistic<br />as the same way as the original Titanic once looked.
B000I8G5GW|5.0|Had some trouble to cancel the order when it showed that I needed two copies, when I only needed on copy.<br />Was difficult to make the correct correction.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I have been using Fabio's apps for years now. With FolderOrganizer, he simply got everything right. I can't run an Android phone without this app. I love being able to organize my apps into categories (which many apps and luanchers can do), but the real benefit is being able to create shortcuts and widgets to access those apps in various ways. Combined with other customization apps such as UCCW, Nova Launcher, Desktop Visualizer, etc. you can really create some cool looking screens with tremendous functionality. I'd buy this app again in a heartbeat!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|The series was well photographed and the acting was excellent.  But the directors, resorted to emphasizing long bloody battle scenes, with lots of disembowling, throat sliting, and beheading to appeal to the 'Lord of the Rings' audience.  The thoughtful lessons of the Bible that applied to human beings thousands of years ago, still apply to our generation today and I thought those lessons were not focused on enough.  When the meaning and lessons were referenced it was very brief, but well done.<br /><br />I do appreciate the producers undertaking this Biblical series in today's culture, but it didn't need to be 'dumbed down' to appeal to the masses.  The world is hungary for Truth, Hope and The Way  and an opportunity was missed to bring it to them.
B004S3MB2U|4.0|Actually improves on a basic app. I'd buy it for $0.99 or less. Fortunately I got it as a FOATD.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|A beautiful little game with wonderful graphics and sounds. Just challenging enough to keep you entertained and annoyed in a good way.
B004UHSB5A|5.0|Plain and simple, I love Dominoes. Nothing intricate here, just a simple game of Dominoes. I play it all the time. If I had paid for it, I would have definitely made a return on my investment by now. It was FAOTD so there you go.

B0061S0A64|4.0|It's fun. It wastes time when you want to. It was free. Simple. What else do you need? I'd probably pay $0.99 for it.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|First of all my three year old downloaded this onto my kindle without me knowing.  Interestingly enough it's one of my wife's favorite games in real life.  This version is no better than any of the free apps you can get and certainly isn't worth $20.  Unfortunately, it's a $20 lesson I've had to learn.  Don't buy this app, it's not worth it.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Definitely one of my favorite games on Android. Nothing too involved or deeply designed, just a fun, easy to play concept.
B000FBJFSC|4.0|The hardscrabble, poor Irish family with the shiftless alcoholic father who can't hold a job and drinks away his paycheck; the long-suffering mother (\\"she was a saint!\\"); the legions of children, some who die young, the rest who struggle by, barefoot, cold and hungry; the protagonist who tries to rise above his lot in life and make his dreams come true in America. It's such a worn out stereotype that it borders on a SNL skit or Family Guy cutaway scene.<br /><br />But this was Frank McCourt's childhood universe, and he can't help it that he lived a stereotype. (Assuming he didn't take too great poetic liberties to stretch the truth, and by all accounts, he didn't.)<br /><br />Just like Tracy Jordan's movie \\"Hard to Watch\\" on 30 Rock, Angela's Ashes is hard to read. In part because of the misery and that fills the pages, but also simply because of the literary style and syntax. There are no quotation marks to denote characters talking and no indents to denote new paragraphs. As a result, the book reads like one long oral tale of woe told by an old man at the pub over several pints of Guinness. At times, McCourt almost rivals James Joyce in his stream of consciousness - though it is nowhere close to being Ulysses' Ashes. But stick with it. It's depressing, it's melancholy, it's frustrating, it's soul-baring, and very, very occasionally, it's uplifting. In short, it's Irish.
B0093QFA0M|4.0|The action scenes with Pickett's charge was awesome but yet sad in the outcome. Chamberline was the hero for the North.
B00006L3IE|5.0|This is a very nice and enjoyable c.d set of music of the Medieval era with many samples that take you back in time very well done .Nice to listen to when relaxing or working .
B00006FDCD|3.0|Either you'll love that they stuck to the pace and content of the book, or you'll be critical of how it's portrayed. It's long and drug out.  Tim Curry is the only actor who rose above the low-grade, cheesy acting.  Oh and of course, if you're scared of clowns, see it.  Don't get me wrong - I gave it an &#34;okay&#34; rating.  But this was mostly based on 1. I'm a fan of the book and 2.  Tim Curry.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|The whole album is awesome! Definitely worth the purchase....Went to see her in Atlanta and she is even better live
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I can't stop playing this game. It's simple, fun and very addictive.  Before you know it, an hour has passed and you are still trying to beat your last high score.
B00499LTLM|5.0|I absolutely love this show! I don't watch TV so I came across this show browsing Amazon Prime Video. I like British shows because they are very well done and the acting is usually great. I love the cast of this show and think Benedict Cumberpatch is great for playing Sherlock. The only complaint I have is that they put way too much makeup on Benedict. He looks pasty. He has a handsome face without all the plaster, I mean makeup on him. I have seen both seasons and am looking forward to the third later this year, at least that is what I read.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Loved the characters. Kept me guessing till the end.<br />  Enjoyed the plot of the story and development of the main character.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its mildly entertaining. my sister loves playing it too so its a win win for both of us. I highly recommend it for anyone with younger children.
B001XUPH9K|5.0|For an old Star Trek movie it was pretty great. With the newest Star Trek movie quickly approaching release, I needed a Star Trek fix, so this is what I watched. Entertaining!
B00003CXS4|5.0|I really love this movie and it's not because of Brad Pitt, although I think his character is great, I love all the character's in this movie, You have to like dark humour and even though I don't really like cussing, you kinda have to ignore that. The funny thing is with the different accents(which I love) it doesn't sound so bad. lol, don't ask why, I don't know. I think it has a great story line and is really interesting
B002SF9YNO|5.0|This is a quietly affecting film, full of surprises that will make the viewer smile. The young cellist winds up in a job he never would have considered, preparing bodies for cremation. Although deeply Japanese, the film encourages reflection on tolerance, generosity, and how every activity in life can be an art, if we make it so. I loved it.
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|Great movie. Very violent. Not for the faint of heart. Children forced to battle it out in this international film.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This  is a game for little to adults because u get to take care of dragons and breed them and see what u get it is a great game
B0064MPXFA|5.0|It is very easy watching material.  Fun after a long day.  Easy to pick up where you left off.  Like having no commercials.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I thought this book was amazing, just as the first one (Bared to You)...I patiently wait for the 3rd book to come out in June!
B009AMANBA|5.0|Anyone with even a modest knowledge of Abraham Lincoln will appreciate this movie.  Lincoln himself could not have been better portrayed, and the historians did their homework.  Unlike the movie Gettysburg, the producers kept \\"Hollywood\\" out of it and gave us a look at history as it truly was.
B00846REIS|5.0|I apparently am a late reader for these books, but I am thinking I am lucky to have started these books a little later. They are WONDERFUL!!! Love these books!!! Now the wait for June until the 3rd book comes out....
B008602KQI|3.0|Nothing special, but good to pass some time, if there is nothing to do. Plot is not original, mostly special effects.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|its really fun easy to learn but the first boss thing is almost impossible to beat and I bought 3cards and it says I cant use them (you cant use chaos card with order) when did I ever choose. besides that the game it amazing.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Like a lot of people, I was a bit hesitant when this album was announced. !0 years since his last album was released is a long time for a legendary rock star. Could David Bowie defy the doubters and his age? Could he release a new album and still sound as fresh and relevant as if he'd never been away? Well, yes he could and yes he did. Just about.<br />There is a weariness to the voice as you would expect for a man of 66 but the lyrics, music and production shine through. He still has a lot to say. Not every song hits you the right way immediately but after repeated plays, they grow on you.<br />He's back. If Bowie is not your thing, then it's not gonna sway you . If you have any kind of interest in this album or the man. Or even if you were wondering what all the fuss is about then give it a chance. it'll enhance your collection. You could download/ buy worse.<br />This is how you make a comeback album.
0743270754|5.0|I've read three other biographies of Lincoln and this more than all the rest pulled me into the heart of Lincoln. I sobbed through the last fifty pages as I realized what people full of hate did to our greatest president. As Doris Kearns Goodwin revealed this complex man's humanity, wisdom, genius and compassion with real life stories, I increasingly felt like Abraham Lincoln was my good friend. While an accurate and well-documented book of history, 'Team of Rivals' is also a page-turner. I couldn't put it down. If you hate the lies, acrimony and vilification so unfairly cast on President Obama and others, right and left, trying to honestly govern our divided country, you will see that they are faint echoes of the dark side that one-hundred-fifty years ago called Lincoln a buffoon, n****r lover and devil and ultimately killed him. What is it about us that keeps us from seeing the good in others until it's taken away?
B005GFPZYK|3.0|My Son is in the NAVY and he first started in the SEALS in Coronado, CA. He did not make it , it is very tough, But I am still proud of him.<br />Chris Kyle is a real American Hero and this Country should recognize that
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|This movie was awesome.  Action packed and a great storyline.  Lot's of gore.  This is definitely a must see movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great app. Love playing this game especially when I can win on the hard games nice that you can get hints on moves. Makes it better
B00005N6KG|4.0|I must have tried all kinds of headphones and not one would stay in my ear.  I've been using these for several years and for the price, the audio quality is great (i'm not an audiophile so i just want something that sounds good).  The wires require delicate treatment otherwise they are easy to break.  Each set lasts about 6-12 months and then I replace them.  For the price, it's a good deal!
B000ZELISO|5.0|This movie is intriguing and fun. I really enjoyed the crispness of the blu-ray as well as the bonus feature called Maximum Movie Mode, this mode has tidbits of information and behind the scenes footage, only available on certain blu-ray editions. I am so pleased, I plan on buying all of the Harry Potter blu-ray editions that come with Maximum Movie Mode.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This was an amazing book! Really touched and melted my heart! This book truly shows the amazing bond between dog and owner and how much love and cAre one shows for each other. It brought smiles, tears, and anger. The author did an great job! I recommend this book to all animal lovers and all who want to really feel a connection between dog and owner. Truly an amazing read
0385349831|3.0|Manuscript Found in Accra is a collection of lectures given to people by a commander as life lessons- answering questions about love, success, miracles, among others. I liked the book overall, but my disappointment comes from the fact that I was expecting to read a novel, which is the category in which it is listed. This is instead a book of philosophy, and will be enjoyed by readers who want to read about the philosophy of life in simple and easy to understand language. The Alchemist by Coelho is one of my favorite books, which has similar messages, but they are interesting because they are made clear, yet subtle by being wrapped inside a well-told story. Plot is what I found missing in this book. Nevertheless, it is written well, and has several quotable quotes:<br /><br />About success::\\"It is being able to go to bed each night with your soul at peace.\\"<br /><br />About miracles:\\"Therefore, Lord, give us this day our daily miracle. And forgive us if we are not always capable of recognizing it.<br /><br />About enemies: \\"Your enemies are not the adversaries who were put there to test your courage. They are the cowards who were put there to test your weakness.\\"<br /><br />About defeat: \\"Take pride in your scars...scars speak more loudly than the sword that caused them.\\"
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The author jumps from character to character in a way that draws the reader into the whole story. Just as you are entrenched with one story the chapter ends and the next starts with another story, reminding you how much you liked another, even more.  Artfully written and engaging.  It was hard to put this book down. The characters are masterfully created, even the ones you should hate often times find your favor.
B005723JSQ|4.0|I first discovered Kinsella's novels while on holiday in the UK... and I must say she has done it again! Number is a funny, entertaining page turner that you won't want to put down. I read it in two days and I couldn't stop giggling at everything Poppy said and did. A must read for Kinsella fans.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I would recommend this game to everyone I know. I love it and play all the time.  so anyone that loves fighting games I deff recommend this game
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Story line could have related to &#34;normal&#34; life, but this was over the top.  Sickened by the language used by all the actors.  The teen language and attitude was disheartening.  I'm amazed that writters and actors use an onslought of filthy language to convey the scene instead of acting.  This movie was a waste, even at $4.99.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Before I saw this film, I was not a fan of Star Trek. I had no interest in it whatsoever and when it came to science fiction adventures, I always chose Star Wars. After seeing this film, I am now a fan of Star Trek. Mr. JJ Abrams has taken a difficult task and achieved it tremendously. He has fashioned an excellent summer blockbuster out of an age old, fan driven franchise. He makes it easy for non-fans, like myself, to step into this world. The action, comedy, drama all hit home in this film with a perfect balance of each. The acting is superb and make these characters more than just a cardboard cut outs of the originals. If you have not seen this film yet, I highly recommend that you do because it's not just for Star Trek fans, it's for anyone who is looking a great time at the movies. Make way for part two!
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Good for the documentary side but if you are looking for action, this does not keep you on the edge.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't really read but I've found it hard to put down. It only took me three days to finish the book.<br /><br />I decided to read the book because the movie was awesome.  The book was extremely better
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Love the series and the BD disks are excellent.<br /><br />My only nitpick is how they laid out the special features.<br /><br />All over the place on different disks, so you have to swap disks out to see different features. Very annoying<br />They should have consolidated them to one disk as most do.<br /><br />Not enough to kick off a star, tho.
B007W1BLN0|4.0|I enjoyed it very much but I was down with the flu pretty bad and not in the<br />best of spirits. If you're feeling blue, I don't recommend it unless you want<br />a good cry.
0345803485|5.0|HOLY CRAP! This love story is beyond words good.  They are such a wonderful couple and Christian is too yummy for words. I love how she describes the way his pants hang off of his hips in that way.  Yeah, I can picture it. Their banter back in forth in their texts to each other is so wonderful.  I did hate sometimes how Anna never does what Christian tells her but she is so young after all.  The ONLY negative thing about this series is now everything I read will come up short.  It has set the bar too high.  I wish the author would have kept it going longer and not let Anna get pregnant so soon.  It could have stretched to four books as far as I was concerned. There wasn't anything I didn't like about it.  Except that it had to end.............
B00358ESI4|5.0|Up there with, what I consider, the best war movies/series of all time.<br />I believe that ALL high school students should be required to watch<br />this along with the following others, so that they can have a better<br />understanding of the realities of war itself:<br />Schindler's List<br />Saving Private Ryan<br />Band of Brothers<br />The Pacific
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Sharpened a few knives with it right away and they were nice and sharp in a few strokes.  Small and light weight so it's easy to pack with camping gear.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Cut the Rope Time Travel retains the simple gameplay but with new twists.  Instead of one Nom to feed you have two, which adds depth and creativity to the puzzles.  The game teaches you New puzzle elements as you go.  Five stars.
B000RLKXEK|5.0|The music is perfect for this...sometimes sensual, sometimes light, sometimes jovial.  Great mix.<br /><br />The destination is revealed early, but the journey is far more interesting.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Well written.  Light and easy to follow.  A tad too much left wing politics.<br /><br />Leaves you believing it is actually possible to influence the world with your mind.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|An amazing story about amazing and brave men of our country. I had heard parts of the story but to hear the details from Marcuss story about the mission was a look into lives that most people never get to hear about.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I've used all the major RDP apps; Splashtop, TeamViewer, PocketCloud, LogMeIn.  I use Splashtop most, because it's the fastest with live video streams.  TeamViewer probably is more powerful, but a bit harder to configure for video streaming. I like to use apps like this to access my security camera laptop, and view it on my tablet while at home or away.  So I was excited to give Jump a try.<br /><br />Jump is very easy to setup.  Just download the app, then go to their website and download the companion software onto the computer you want to control.  You can do a direct VPN or use your Google account for fast and easy setup.  I was up and running in under 5 min.<br /><br />The connection from my tablet to my laptop is very fast. Probably the fastest of all the RDP apps I've tried.  My security cams were all rendering seamlessly and the video was crisp, clear, and stutter free.  Oh, and I'm running a dozen security cams at once, so it's no small task to stream all that live video so cleanly.<br /><br />I still think TeamViewer is a more powerful RDP app, with file sharing, meetings and all it has to offer.  But the video streaming with Jump is so fast,  that it may well become my day to day, go-to RDP app. Really liking it thus far, and the setup couldn't be easier.  Love it. EXCELLENT FAOTD!! Happy! ;oD<br /><br />UPDATE:  I've been playing around with Jump like a kid in a candy store.  This app is fantastic.  There's a Free Remote Desktop companion program available at Jump's website.  With that, I'm now able to control 2 computers directly with it; laptop to laptop.  I have to say, the more I use it, the more impressed I am with Jump.<br /><br />Dedicated Windows Key - If you've used any of the RDP apps, you know how tricky it can be sometimes just to hit that darn Windows key on the computer you're trying to access.  Jump has a dedicated Windows key on the interface window itself, which makes it very easy.<br /><br />File Transfers - Still trying to figure that one out.  There's always a bit of a learning curve.  But at least I know it's possible.<br /><br />Local Network Direct Connection - the instructions say you can connect 2 computers on the same local network, via IP address, rather than using a Google account. This will come in handy for linking and controlling all my computers at home, without racking up any data fees.<br /><br />Love this app!<br />Go ahead JUMP on in!one out.

But at least I know it's possible.<br /><br />Local Network Direct Connection - the instructions say you can connect 2 computers on the same local network, via IP address, rather than using a Google account.

B003LQ3YXU|2.0|I understand this show has quite a following so I watched the first show, then a little of Season 2's opener.  Not my taste at all.
B00B7G3BUW|4.0|Really compelling move.  Don't need to see Part 1 to enjoy this one.  Check it out if you're a Batman fan.
B00899F0G8|5.0|This is the number one show for a reason. Questions will be answered but the ending is the best part.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|Guess Disney thinks we have Stupid pasted on our foreheads.  No way would I pay this much for a 3D movie only.  I have several TVs and will not be stuck to watching it on only my 3D TV.  I'll pass on this purchase until they do a combo set.  Or wait until Thanksgiving comes around and get it during Black Friday when its cheap and reasonable.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|I like this book because it helps u under stand the fundamentals of conversation and really this book helped me out a lot
B0063M22QO|3.0|I ordered Mahjong for my Kindle after getting it for my I Pad.  The version I have on my I Pad is different and more difficult.  I prefer that version and thought that was what I was getting when I downloaded for my Kindle.  I am disappointed in this version.
B000FC1192|4.0|It was a good book, not the  best.  I got a little board wile I was reading it. Four star.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|The movie is a classic and one  that I have long loved. The acting, costumes and dialogues are all respelndent.
B009NX4PVU|4.0|Great movie that raised awarenes about aids/hiv and the prejudice of alternative lifestyles. Sadly twenty years later that awareness is still being raise.  People are still uneducated about std's and haste crimes are being committed.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|it is so fun but why do you have to pay soooooooooo much $2.99 like really it should a least be $0.99 who agrees
B004UHL9EK|4.0|I've been using this app for several weeks now and it fits really well into my life.  I haven't uninstalled my alarm app yet but as I get more comfortable with all the options in this one, I am leaning that way.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|I enjoyed the book, but did not find myself greatly surprised with the ending.  I was disappointed with the final story arc for some of the main characters.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Best BS CD yet.  I would highly, highly recommend this.  He is so talented and entertaining.  Very, very good and well worth the money.
B009POCG0Y|5.0|Mcconaughey is a much better and broader ranged actor than I ever imagined.  After all the pretty boy roles he has played, I was very impressed with this.  They seem to have captured a part of the world that no one really wants to know is there.<br /><br />Good job
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved the game! Very intriguing.  Could not put it down!  Enjoyed not having to run from room to room like most mystery games require you to do.  Will definitely be watching and looking for others like this one!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fifty shades of gray is one of the best books.  I am so engaged with the characters and the authors writing of this type of book.  It is the first time I ever read this genre.
B007N6NGYG|4.0|Nice graphics and decent sound. The game play ramps up in difficulty a little too quick, but still enjoyable anyways.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put the book down! Very dramatic yet heartwarming. A good read for the young adults that enjoy reading.
B007ZSBQYE|3.0|I don't want to hammer the game too much. I like the concept, and the graphics are nice, but the controls are next to impossible to control on a hand held phone. Maybe it's me.
B008602KQI|4.0|I kept seeing young adults reading the book so I was curious to find out what was so riveting.  The movie is about the misuses of power and the courage and intelligence required to empower yourself in impossible situations.  It is about accepting and receiving help from unlikely places, friendship, love and loyalty.  Good life lessons for people of all ages. Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence is magnificent and Woody Harrelson shines.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|The only thing I l don't like about it, I should had written it.  My book &#34;Swordslinger,&#34; is about a 1300's Scot.  My next book is called &#34;Raven's Light:  Book One: The Ravens are coming.  Its like a Game of Thrones with wings.<br /><br />The man character plays the part perfect.  That &#34;light&#34; in his eyes and self confidence makes him believable for the part.  The writing really captures the feel of the world then I think.  It covers the politics, war tricks, passions and love interests, and wounds take awhile to heal.  The setting is gorgeous.  The theme song is perfect with the opening video.<br /><br />I think though, the tempting the brother to fight against Ragnar is a little overt done or exploited a little touch much by very adversary Ragnar has.  I'm a little confused about sharing the women....sometimes it seems okay and acceptable then being with another is a terrible thing in it.<br /><br />All the main characters live except Gabriel Byrne, the vying leader.  No main characters you care about have died that would really add a lot more tension to all the scenes.  Its kind of like Star Trek with the one time episode character beaming down gets killed but never Spock, Bones, etc.  In the series Revolution, it was surprising that one of the main character's brother dies after traveling over a thousand miles and risking of life a dozen times...but it added a little more realism to it.  Like for example, Hell On Wheels, the main character's love interest dies, total surprise for she was a major character but it really worked....shocking, emotional...let's viewers know anything could happen.  It's right there with Game of Thrones... (Ned dies first season, that was a big shocker.)  Game of Thrones, Vikings, Walking Dead... all doing great.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is excellently written show and have seen seasons 1-3 and can't wait for season 4. If you like British tv then get this series
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is a great game! Lots of fun, great graphics, good story, just way too short for $5!!!<br />I wish I could give it five stars because it's a great game!
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much. Revenge is sweet sometimes. The bounty hunter was a true friend.  I may watch it again soon.
B0026S93C0|1.0|This movie had no plot, no character development, and the two major characters were both certifiably insane.<br />I wouldn't watch this again if I was paid to.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this is a great game my grandson and i play and can talk, he really loves playing it and so do i
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I was having so much fun with this game! I even got to a level 30. but suddenly it stopped working. All it says when I open it is that its downloading anywhere between 65-170mb. I sit and I wait to see if it will actually work, then I either get a connection error or it crashes the game. I have been trying for almost 3 weeks to get it to work, but nothing is helping. not even uninstalling and installing again. so I finally deleted the game. regardless of how much fun it was before, I'm sick of it slowing down my kindle fire and just refusing to work. if it ever does work again though and I see the reviews getting better in the future, I may redownload this game.
B008OOYALE|4.0|This is a great game to play with grandkids hatching and watching the dragons grow really all ages ha ha
B00AGDVWDK|5.0|So glad I could finally find this movie for my library.  Have loved it for years.  One of my holiday favorites.
B000U0F7RG|2.0|I love the show, I don't like the cardboard sleve the CD slides into.  I think disc 1 already got scratched because of this cheap packaging.  saved money purchasing the series in this kit, but the cheap packaging made that a poor decision.
B004PYDBVM|4.0|Aquariums of Pyongyang was an excellent and engaging account of life in one of North Korea's concentration camps. I found myself fascinated by the depictions of the god like way in which children are taught to revere Kim Il-sung and his descendants. These innocent children grow up to become conflicted adults who are forced to watch every word they say and every thing they do or risk being swept off to concentration camps.  The book does an excellent job of depicting this internal conflict as it details the terrible plight of an average family who managed to survive the camps.<br /><br />The only shortcoming with the book must be a result of it's translation from Korean to French and then finally to English.  There are a few places where you'll have to read a sentence a second time to really grasp the meaning, but these errors are few and they do not detract from the compelling nature of the story overall.
159562015X|4.0|i thought the book was great. I have done other assessments. I was not surprised by my top. I was disappointed because you take the assessment and it give you your results for the top 5 (your personal guide) and then it tells you how to go about working on your strengths. They give you this online and it's in the book. So, this made it a quick read. Now if you have others taking the assessment or you can compare, etc otherwise it's a one time use book until you look up someone else's or you read up on yours again. I have bought the one for Leadership and will see how that comes out.
B009CRJLHU|3.0|Travis is a violent, man whore...who falls in love. Abby is a girl hardened by life experiences...who knows boys just like Travis...and isn't interested in being one of the many. There is so many reasons for it not to work out... but what if it could?<br /><br />This was a really good book...most of the time. I think most people will love this book...and I think if this and walking disaster were one book I would have loved it as well. This is not about two hurting people that find each other in chaos. This is about an unhealthy relationship at its worst. It was beautifully written but it was not something I liked. I found it disturbing on so many levels. If only because I have been there myself and have watched so many of my friends go through relationships just like this one... but lets just talk about the book itself.<br /><br />Characters:<br />I am a glutton for punishment... because I know so many men just like Travis... yet I fell in love with this character. I wanted to hold him when he was grabbing for what sanity he had left. I was angry with Abby much of this book... but I think I just thought like most women do when they see something that is bad for them... I thought yep... I need that. Abby was clawing for a way out the whole time in this book. always mad, always hurting. Yet always going back... she made me mad...probably because I saw a little bit of myself in her.<br /><br />Plot:<br />The plot was very interesting something I read through rather quickly. This wasn't a bad book... it just had me angry by the end. I wanted the ending to be better... I wanted to see them better themselves...not jump into something that might ultimately hurt the progress they were making.<br />(less)
B004P8A7J2|4.0|Sad stories of 4 lives intertwined with drugs and bad decisions.  I still remember Jennifer Connelly from Labyrinth in the 1980's.  She definitely is an adult especially in this movie.  Sounds tend to jump out at you during this movie so be sure you're not watching this at 10pm at night with the volume all the way up if you live in an apartment.
B002ZG98C8|5.0|Classic Robert Rodriguez filmography, with plenty of laugh out loud scenes.  A sure cult classic, almost as many great lines as &#34;The Big Lebowski&#34;<br /><br />Check in for the first 7 minutes for an unforgettable, etched in my mind scene with Mayra Leal as &#34;Chica&#34;............and where can I find more of her film work?
B001F12J0C|5.0|These are my favourite movies. I was pretty hesitant because of the price. I was afraid they were going to be pirated DVDs on scratched discs or something. Brand new, in the package and everything. Delivered on time, as well. I still love the books, but having the trilogy is great when I don't feel like reading. Plus, a Bourne Movie Marathon is now possible on rainy days.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My family and I enjoy playing the game and try I to beat each other's score. We are competitive and enjoy this game. Our scores have gotten better with the more we play.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This is a fun and relaxing game to play. Basically you plant and decorate your reef to attract other fish and make it look nice.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|The best season yet. There's quite a lot of magical moments. I certainly would recommend this season for Merlin lovers.
B005723JSQ|4.0|I like how she put a modern twist on the plot. I couldn't put this book down, around every page turn was a new funny moment.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Interesting storyline, not what I expected. Its really funny the things that happen and how it all works out for all the couples involved.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|For those of us you were in our early 20&#34;s in 1973, no one came even close to doing wfat this multifaceted magician managed to do.  And have filmed, given the limited technology at the time.<br />Pretty trippy, no unintended.<br />Enjoy!
1451648537|4.0|I liked the book and the way Isaacson explain different situations of Job's life to build this biography. This encourage me to buy two more books of him: Einstein's Bio and American Sketches.
B0051MKMNC|5.0|This movie was GREAT! I loved the story. Bradley Cooper & Robert De Niro were amazing in this film. It is for sure one of my favorite movies.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Everyone talked about this show so last summer I watched a few episodes on TV and was instantly hooked.  When I saw all the seasons were available on Prime, I started with season one and am going through watch each season and see why everything is the way it is on the show!  Love it!
B008220D5K|3.0|Really liked &#34;Knocked Up&#34; & could not wait to see this movie. It was funny but I was finding myself saying it was getting annoying.
B003L1ZWG2|4.0|seen this movie before and it keeps you on the edge of your seat not for the squeamish buy it you will like it
B004UFEJVW|5.0|This movie was such a beautiful story. Watch it all the time & love it. Pixar always makes wonderful movies & this is one of my favorites.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Great storytelling plenty of twist and character evolution. Kind of long and dragging too much in some chapters. But overal, story keeps the momentum.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Like most people, I was aware of the basic outline of this story.  But I had no appreciation for the details of the story of Steve Jobs and of Apple. And I can't help but wonder how a great company that was so dependent of its visionary leader can continue to blaze a path that amazes and excites people as Apple has for a long time. I guess time will tell.
B007KWD7BK|3.0|I like this cd but don't find myself going as overboard in it's praise as have some others.............If you are indeed a &#34;dopesmoker&#34; you will more than likely love this cd...................Unless you like techno in which case forget this cd..............
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Wow, what can I say? This was one of the most enjoyable books that I have read in a long time. Mostly written in a first person, Robinson Caruso kind of voice, it allows you to ride the roller coaster of events that the main character endures. To round things out, Mr. Weir occasionally flashes out to the Earth bound controllers and the still space bound surviving crew of the original mission. What follows is first the shocked discovery of the survival and then the frantic rush to rescue.  Spaced (LOL..see what I did there?) throughout this tale is convincing and logical science....something not always found in books that are nevertheless labeled Sci-Fi. That is not to say I can vouch for the accuracy (I can't), but that is really secondary.<br /><br />All in all, a very very good read and well worth the asking price.
B0091WUZJE|5.0|Just read a book about the making of this movie: The Searchers by Glenn Frankel and it was a real treat to see the movie.  After being to monument valley, it is amazing to see how this movie captured it's majestic beauty.

B00CL0J99K|5.0|I think this is the best &#34;Iron Man&#34; until now! I loved it and, even more important (and quite incredible in fact), my wife liked it even MORE! Below you will find more of my impressions. This review in principle is FREE OF SPOILERS.<br /><br />&#34;Iron Man 3&#34; is a merry, cheerful adventure, very fast paced, with excellent fighting scenes, but mostly relying on humor and excellent dialogs, full of typicall Tony Stark's jokes, half acid, half bitter but always pretty funny. The story is mostly about Tony's past coming back to kick him in the butt with the maximum speed and strength, forcing him to visit places even more exotic than the wormhole in &#34;Avengers&#34;, like deep ocean and rural Tennessee - and no more will be said. There are some darker moments, but general mood of this film is light - this is an amusement ride, not the voyage to the heart of the darkness.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr offers here to his public a spotless, brilliant performance, even better than in previous parts and &#34;Avengers&#34; - and honestly, I think here he is even better (funnier) than in his &#34;Sherlock Holmes&#34; franchise.<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow is a very, very beautiful woman - but in this film she is much more than that. She is HOT, she is smoking hot, she is burning hot, she is lava hot, she literally bursts in flames so hot she is, in fact she is so hot that by moments she outshines the principal hero...))) No, for real, it is not an exaggeration - I will even hasard an opinion that in this film she reaches the degree of hotness never before attained by any other Hollywood actress...)))<br /><br />Guy Pearce does well in this film. The character of Tony Stark's loyal bodyguard named Happy plays an important role. There are also some more hot bad guys and girls involved.<br /><br />Dora the Explorer makes a short but remarkable appearance in her debut on the big screen - but nothing more will be said. And no, this is not a joke!<br /><br />But it is Ben Kingsley, who plays the &#34;Mandarin&#34; who completely steals the show once we arrive to his evil den, which is a place of vile infamy, maleficent plots, decadent delights and rotten corruption so infamous on so many levels that it defies imagination! Believe me, in whole history of cinematographic villains, you have never seen a place so abominably unique as the horrifying hostile heretic hideous hidden hideout of &#34;Mandarin&#34;! And the lord and master of this place matches it in infect depravation!<br /><br />Very exceptionally for a Hollywood super blockbuster, this film is not offensive to French or Muslims. No, really. I am serious.<br /><br />As I already stated above, this film is so good, that my wife, who usually is not at all into comic books and/or superheroes almost died laughing and she actually thanked me for taking her to see it (and that doesn't happen often!). Therefore I recommend it without hesitation for a viewing with your wife or girlfriend - this should be a very pleasant common experience.<br /><br />I will say nothing more here. Go see it in the cinema as long as it still plays - and me, I think I will definitely buy the DVD as soon as it is available! Enjoy!n Kingsley, who plays the &#34;Mandarin&#34; who completely steals the show once we arrive to his evil den, which is a place of vile infamy, maleficent plots, decadent delights and rotten corruption so infamous on so many levels that it defies imagination!

1932907009|5.0|I had been tinkering with an original screenplay off and on for 13 years! I could never finish it. Finally I hired a coach who told me to get this book. It was immensely helpful (and entertaining). A must-read for any budding screenwriter.
B008JFUO36|5.0|I liked this film. It is not an immortal master-piece, but it is well made. Below, some more of my impressions, with limited SPOILERS.<br /><br />Year of Grace 2079. After a devastating war against alien invaders, Moon was broken in pieces and Earth was left a barren, poisoned desolation. The aliens were in principle defeated but what was left of humanity had to move to Titan, which is now being slowly terraformed. The ruined Earth was abandoned to two categories of inhabitants - the Scavs, a handful of alien survivors, stranded castaways barely managing to survive miserably one day at a time and the two lonely humans, Victoria (Andrew Riseborough) and Jack (Tom Cruise) who supervise the last stage of evacuation of the planet, which includes pumping and carrying away what remains of uncontaminated water on Earth by robotic installations and automated cargo ships.<br /><br />Jack does the most dangerous job by flying daily repair and maintenance missions, mostly fixing combat drones, which protect the installations from the desperate and aggressive Scavs. From their flying house, a safe refuge out of reach of Scavs, Victoria watches over him, warns him of dangers and if necessary musters drones to help him. It is a harsh and quite sad life, but they have one another for comfort - and also their task will soon be over.<br /><br />But Jack is not well. He doesn't sleep well since some time and every morning wakes up more and more tired, exhausted by strange dreams which repeat themselves - dreams in which he meets a strange Woman (Olga Kurylenko), a woman he can not remember ever knowing, but who nevertheless seems surprisingly familiar... And then, one day after he wakes up for another day of work on the surface, the film really begins...<br /><br />This is a good film, although it borrows heavily from many of older and better Sci-Fi movies (I will not name them, to avoid spoilers - but you will recognise them). Although Philip K. Dick didn't have anything to do with the scenario, he would probably recognise his influence in it - and I think he would have liked this film, for quite a lot of reasons... There is a good mixture of slow scenes setting the mood and of action. There is a mystery in this film, and the FULL disclosure is not given until almost the end - and it is done very, very well indeed. And the ending, always the most vulnerable spot for all Sci-Fi super-productions, is well done - and it is both moving and in the same time asking questions, on which we have to think a little before answering...<br /><br />Tom Cruise, who notwithstanding some excentricities, is a great actor, gives here a GREAT performance, both when talking and when shooting. Olga Kurylenko and Morgan Freeman (who appears late in the film in a way which you will have to discover by yourself) are also very good. But personally, I was MOST impressed by the character of Victoria and the way Andrea Riseborough played her. It is not an easy role and it is definitely not easy to outstage a looker like Olga Kurylenko - but in my personal opinion Ms Riseborough totally did it!<br /><br />Another personal favorite in this film are combat drones - they are really cool, both in their visual aspect (shape and especially this SPEED!) and in the sounds they produce. Those are really some bad@ss military robots, infinitely more dangerous and cooler than most of such things in recent Sci-Fi. And just to be clear - do not expect any cute Transformers-like machines... Those things were made to fly far, find quickly and terminate with extreme prejudice, not to sell action-figures...)))<br /><br />There are of course plot holes - but well, come on, without plot holes all heroes would always die and bad guys would always win. And who would like that?<br /><br />Bottom line, I liked this film and I am very happy that finally I was given the opportunity to watch a GOOD big budget SciFi film. Try to catch it in the cinema as long as it is still playing - me, I think I will buy the DVD when it is available, because it is worth another watching one day. Enjoy!ll buy the DVD when it is available, because it is worth another watching one day. Enjoy!
1596434252|5.0|I bought this book for my girl friends nephew. When we were looking at it we were really surpirsed at how interesting it was. I ended up buying one for her to display. It really is display worthy! Buy one and put it on the shelf; everyone will ask you about it.
1455526959|5.0|Those are the words that Harry lives by. the circumstances of his mother's death have haunted him throughout this amazing series. I hunted down the first Bosch book, [[ASIN:0446613444 The Black Ice]] so that i could follow the character's development, and it was well worth it.this entry into the Bosch saga is Connelley at top form, in my view. Harry is working on a program called TARP, for retiring LAPD detectives, and is on the Open/Unsolved Unit. We see a crime that took place during the Rodney King riots so long ago, and Harry is determined to close the case. I don't always give five stars to Connelley, but this one deserves it. If you have followed Harry down the long road of his career, don't miss this chapter in the saga!
B001XUIBNO|5.0|One of the movies that constantly come up in terms of scriptwriting, camera work, direction, acting, etc. As close as you can get to perfection in most categories (makeup, lighting, costumes, sound.) The story is so solid, the filmmaking so deft, that even though it's coming up on its 40th birthday this film is still can hold its audience.
B007REV4T8|2.0|Have loved Bond movies all my life...  Cannot get in to this one at all.  Have tried watching it six or seven times...way to boring.
B006T5C5PS|5.0|very helpful and informative. easy to read straight to the point. lots of great tips. some cool recipes too. it came in very handy
B006FK7SZ4|3.0|wasn't what I expected it to be. there was touch going on with the website it self. Should not use
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Well, EL James has done it again. I couldn't put it down! I won't give away any plot details, all I can say is this: on to book three!!! Laters ;-)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series is just awesome. I purchased on Amazon because I got addicted to it via Netflix and didn't want to wait for season 3 to come out there. It was worth the money to purchase episodes. It is also cheaper to buy here then Apple TV.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|It is great and grabs you from the beginning; Can't wait  until the next Pendergast novel. You never know what will happen

1742200508|5.0|I used to travel a lot for work, and rarely knew a week in advance where in the world I might end up. So I seldom had time to look at a travel guide to try to find a few sights to see. How I wish I had owned this beautiful, information-packed guide to England back then! My daughter is about to go, so I got this guide for her, but have enjoyed reading it. I found a lot of things that I missed on my trips, to say the least! This guide has really helpful information, not just great sections by region of where to go and what to see, but many maps of the area spotting the streets and sights. The pictures are beautiful, but I particularly love the sections such as the brief history of the country, about the people, and what to do in an emergency. I love the top 20 experiences and am sad to see how many I have missed. The guide also comes with a pull-out city map of London. You are sure to have an amazing trip with this very comprehensive guide!
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|Great action movie.  Really enjoyed watching this.  Recommend it for those that like shoot them up stories with some fist fights.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have read this book 5 times now and it is still exciting.  I have read similar books but none compare.<br /><br />I like the fact that Christian is so protective of Anna.  I don't like the fact that he whipped her.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I don't usually read books like this, but once I started, I couldn't put it down. It's well written, fast paced and inventive. I'm a psychotherapist and I still couldn't figure out what all the characters' angles were until the end. It was a great vacation book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and I like to play it. I also like getting coins and new characters. You should try it .
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|What a fun book.  Doing the experiments was exciting.  Guess what?  They work.  You will be glad when you buy this book.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|This is a great book, and you should read it. If you read Enders game, read this review.<br />--<br />  After reading \\"Enders Game\\" I was ready for MORE ENDER. Complete addict. And was weary of even looking at another book, because...I didn't want to be disappointed.<br /><br />  Once you get into the story,  you get attached to the new characters, as well as get a decent 'Ender-fix.'<br /><br />  Keep in mind it is heavier than \\"Enders Game.\\" But it is an excellent read. .
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I started this book and finished this book in one day. I read ( more like absorbed) this book in less than 24 hours!! I'm extremely pleased to see such talent coming from so close to home!
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|the first two were riveting, if you want to know the inner workings of the entire swedish gov't and police force, then surely tune in, Surrounded by that technical information is the actual story .
B0044WSF5M|4.0|Great fun movie with great music of the 50's, brings back lots of memories from my youth, you must watch it.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Sorry to see the the story end but what an ending it is. Robert Jordan is an great story teller.
B00003CY5J|5.0|The plot and the actors in the movie were great. I enjoyed watching the movie and the views of Montreal.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|we love watching this awsome tv series. it has everything we love about sci-fi movies. the action continues for season 2.
0762777931|3.0|I love Kris Carr.  Great book... Unless you have 5 kids a tiny budget and live in the middle of west Texas.  I just felt discouraged and pretty sure if I got sick I would be up a creek without a paddle.  This life style is a full time job.
B007REW8DO|5.0|Okay, my wife is a bona-fide Twihard, cd's, books, magazines, the movies! In her room, you her Twilight music or the movie's going thru out the day, One tune caught my ear by Christina Perri, &#34;A Thousand Years&#34;!  I saw the last installment of the Twilight Saga in Imax and liked it,<br /><br />Christina's music is fresh, enjoyable and I like it.  Not going to mince words.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Maybe that was the author's goal and if it was she succeeded. I absolutely hated both of the main characters and didn't even really like any of the supporting characters. The story itself was riveting and surprising - I definitely wasn't expecting any of the things that happened. Every prediction that I had was way off. But I just wanted to like someone - I wanted someone to root for. I guess I was rooting for both of them to fail. Page turner for sure, but I was left feeling sort of hollow at the finish.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This game is adorable. You get to help Nemo build a reef and meet other fish along the way. As an owner of an aquarium business, I am pleasently surprised at how accurate the designers are. All the coral names are correct and what particular fish like what is accurate. Its great for anyone wanting to learn about reef systems and play a cute app at the same time.<br /><br />Now what I don't like is how much things cost and the time delays on certain things is kind of ridiculous. Unless you use pearls, the typical hard to come by currency, you can wait up to 6-10 hours on feeding a coral that has 3 feeds until finished. That's a bit much. Also, sand dollars, the regular currency you buy items with, is a bit scarce in the beginning. I find myself having to collect from the few corals that give money a lot, which means having to stay in game while they get ready to harvest.<br /><br />The negatives are the reason I can only give this app 4 stars instead of 5. It was free, so its not like I wasted money. As a free app, I say get it. Its clean, adorable and fun. Oh, when you touch the fish in the reef, it makes them swim away from your finger. Its pretty funny. Children will love this game too since it has nemo and all his friends. They will learn as they go. Enjoy!!!
B00B19GKI0|5.0|Great movie! Classic Kurt Russel flick about a futuristic New York Being a prison, a must see if you love the classic 80 flicks!

0596805527|5.0|Provides a thorough account of the language, neighboring technology and has a great reference section.  For someone who is an experienced developer in several programming languages and environments, but completely unfamiliar with JavaScript, it was the ideal book.  It does not skimp on details, and that is a good thing.
B001GWK2MC|1.0|I bought this product for my children, ages 2 1/2 and 1. They used it maybe 3 times. We deflated it, to put it away for company coming. When we got it back out and went to inflate it, it ripped along one of the seams...about 10 inches, so much bigger than the \\"patch\\" that was provided. Since it had been longer than 30 days, it was not covered by the warranty. I do not recommend anyone purchasing this.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|This novel was very well written as it slowly brings you into the story of a retarded boy name Charlie and is adventures through life as he is taking in for some experiments... What experiments they were conducting is up to you to find out - read this novel! I simply loved it - it was so great that I stopped playing video games, reading other novels and experimenting with electronics to read this!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I never thought I could read an author other than Vince Flynn who could keep me guessing right up to the end of the book. Baldacci has done that with this book. I loved every word of it.
B000ZP6MMU|4.0|Very good fit (I wear 11 1/2....this is 11....don't size up!) Comfortable insole with the right arch support....don't have to have heal strap to keep it on as it fits fairly snugly. Doesnt have any vent holes which makes it rather sweaty for extended work (also keeps your feet relatively clean.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|Captures a part of ancient history not often seen. The ending is rather violent for my taste, but illustrative of the period.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this I think is better than pandora, you get news, Music, sports  all in one plate , best radio app
B000AAF1U4|5.0|A fun movie for children and families about how changing your negative attitude to positive can change how your life goes.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|A classic fantasy story that I have very much enjoyed and wanted for my DVD library. This was well made and tastefully done for all but very young children.
B006MW3UZW|3.0|I would have watched more episodes but only few were free to view. Not ussually interested in british movies much.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I use it on all three of my computers, my cell, and, now, on my Kindle. It's kept all of them safe, even though one of my laptops and my cell recently were attacked. Avast caught and alerted me before I was aware there was a problem. The best thing you can do is protect your stuff, because you're also protecting everyone who shares your network. If you don't want Avast for some reason, get SOMETHiNG.

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|If you love the movie your gonna love this  especially the background music you should get this app i mean it
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|This bottle cutter took a few minutes to assemble...<br />It is very easy and fun to use.<br />My first bottle came out perfect!! But the next few ones would leave a little extra on the rim.. or would crack... etc.<br />I guess I just need to practice. I think it's very important to score evenly so you don't get the &#34;veins&#34; that crack in different directions while you're pouring the cold water. I used the method where you use very hot water and ice cold water.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Wondeful TV show. Very professional, good combination of actors. Good stories.<br />But all the above together would not have made it a top show without the<br />Superb performance by Julianna Margulies!!!
B005C8ENI0|4.0|The plot was unique, but it was an interesting movie.  McConaughey did a good job with his role and plays the part well.  Overall a very good movie.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|My kids love this game. We have Temple Run 1 as well. Temple run 2 is a bit harder but now my husband is addicted to it as well. Good clean fun for kids. No guns and blood. Yeah!!!
B009NXV2RK|5.0|Couldn't put it down.....fiction but events in the story are so believable. Will make a great movie when it comes out!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Game is fun if you are sitting at the Dr waiting for  a appointment an even the kiddos can play
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the booooooooooooooooooooooooooooom I love it the big fat dude doens't need to be in there but it is fine
B00CH87HF4|4.0|this game fun but why do you have to buy potions with real money. also while playing an archer I found it hard to see far in front of my charactor. not sure if its just me but I was having problems with that. however it a fun game and it was perfect for me and my friends
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I bought this game for children to play and found that I had fun with it too!  I would recommend this game.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I gave this book a five because I could not put it down.  So many twist and turns.  So much mystery.  I wanted Jacob to be innocent and stupidly still felt he could be.  Is it true you can have a bad gene that makes you do horrible things???
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I like the in depth descriptions of the characters and surroundings--from Rose to her home decor. I would<br />(and already have) recommend this book, especially those who have a love for Ireland.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Usually, I hate reading. But when I saw the hunger game movie I fell in love. I was so excited for catching fire to come out. I wanted to know what happens so I bought the book and read it. It is simply fantastic. Suzanne Collins is an amazing writer
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great book very intriguing long winded at times but the story is worth some monotony<br />Look forward to next novel
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Makes you think while you are flowing.  You believe that this game is a piece of cake but once you get started, you find out that you have to fix the batter and then bake the cake!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Can't wait for Season 3.  Thomas & O'Brien will get what is coming<br />to them, I hope soon!!  Looking forwaard to some happy times for<br />all involved.
B005HSL626|4.0|It's a fun game and it keeps you at it to beat your previous score and it's even better if you are playing others.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Good story and kept my interest throughout the movie with great visuals and good action.  This movie makes you appreciate the animal trainer as I don't know how they could have trained this tiger to perform as he did.  I would recommend for the whole family.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I think this app is great and I highly recommend it for texting note : have to have enternet that stinks but its great TRY IT!

B0063M22QO|4.0|I really enjoy it an enjoyable game to play.  it is very challenging and rewarding to beat your own scores.  try I.
B004W1GCNC|3.0|All I can think of when I watch this show is that they're trying too hard to be like Downton Abbey. The story was slightly intriguing, but not enough that I'm going to keep watching.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Another I couldn't put it down read and this is the second time I've read it. It is so captivating because you find yourself always fighting for then to make it and I feel myself being crushed right along with them for every heartbreak! The only thing I don't love is sometimes the phrases get really repetitive through the books. Maybe the third will be different
0307948110|2.0|I was looking forward to reading this book. I wanted to like it. So, what went wrong? Maybe it was that I just finished [[ASIN:067002578X Syndrome E: A Novel]] which was fantastic. No, it was more than that. First, the protagonist isn't even remotely likeable. He's pretty much a douche - a brilliant douche - but a douche nonetheless.<br /><br />Brilliant, secretive physics whiz kid develops an artificial intelligence system which has an uncanny ability to predict financial markets. On top of that, the system has the ability to \\"learn.\\" Have you figured out the \\"big surprise\\" plot twist yet? C'mon, everyone knows it.

B003JTHXOK|4.0|Good book, but just very slow until the final few chapters. An easy and mindless read for some romantic fun.
B00BU8RNCE|5.0|Very intense movie with suberb acting. I just loved it and had to own it. Best reality movie I have seen in a long time.
B007RCJNDE|4.0|A somewhat satisfying ending since it was just as predicted. But somewhere along the line this story lost its magic. I just didn't care when key characters met with hardship and even death. It was more surreal than real. Forced.
B00785P2QC|4.0|good game to take up ur kids spare time kind of entertaining to watch them create a city and have fun at the same time
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Loved this story, easy reading with many emotional moments. Heartwarming and full of love, some suspense. Story told from a dog's point of view.
B0001MIQHQ|1.0|Be careful on this one. I apparently wasn't. It's for Region 2 in PAL format.  Be sure you read the whole description before ordering.
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|Wow. I originally saw this in the movie theatre, but I had to purchase it. Suspenseful and thought provoking. Anyone who enjoyed &#34;Ghost in the Darkness&#34; will probably love this movie. High action,  edge of your seat, and it has a twist at the end. Im a big fan of Liam Neeson anyway. I was impressed by the movie.
0553346687|5.0|Funny, funny ass book. Cool stories about a guy that's led an interesting life. I love these kinds of books. When I retire I want to be able to write a book like this
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Since I am typing this on an iPad I will keep it short.<br />I read this book for my neighborhood book club and I was dreading it because I had seen many interviews with Sheryl that I thought it would be a waste of time, ( I am a working mom too!)<br /><br />But I really appreciate Sheryl's intent to further the feminist movement. All of her stories are charming and on point.<br /><br />So why not 5 stars? I am a tough grader and 5 stars are reserved for books that cause me to change. This book was inspiring but did not move me into action.<br /><br />I think Sheryl missed the opportunity to really explore how many women do lead differently, which is a good thing. In other words, we should be leading more because we provide a moral compass that most of corporate America has forgotten.<br /><br />Even Sheryl, being a women is focused on not only doing her job well, but helping other women claim their power. I heard on NPR how female execs in the coffee industry are trying to help other female coffee farmers gain financial stability.<br /><br />That message encourages women to pursue their passion to lead and nurture, which is in our biology. But a message to lean in because we should, made me felt a little lazy, and uninspired.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|This was a great story.  Scott's life is relatable, yet extraordinary simultaneously.  Every chapter does leave you wanting more detail or information.
B00A83075M|3.0|The movie is a five star production, with engaging characters and a well-constructed plot, but the DVD has some flaws such as a couple of skips and some sudden appearance of subtitles that interfere with viewing.  Before you buy this DVD, you should check and see if those problems were resolved.
B0085W09ME|5.0|Like this app. Was able to find the flights I was looking for and was able to the book the flights without any problems, Will use again.
B0042816YK|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters and I watch it everytime it comes on television. I use it as a reference guide when I need to remind myself I'm on the right path.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|I like the character development and how it never seems to go as I think it will, which is so rare in today's predictable Hollywood scene.
B004RKXN44|4.0|Nalini Singh is very good. The Psy Changeling series is very engaging, you just want to read the next one.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Fun to play. Easy to start. Free. The only thing that's annoying is that they set the price of certain dinosaurs and buildings so high that you pretty much have to purchase in game bucks to afford them.  But if you have enough patience, you can play without buying anything.
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|Sometimes it gets mired down in detail but is very informative.  It is a part of history that I am interested in and sets the background for other books of the era that I have read.
B00BSBXA98|2.0|The download was so blurry on my Sony tv that I thought at first it was 3 D.  We only watched a couple minutes because it was so poor.  Don't know what is wrong with this amazon download but I generally have no problems with amazon stream.  I can't rate the movie only the provider and it was very poor in deed.
B003M70O5O|4.0|I like this show.  Season Two was better than season one.  I would recommend it to anyone, especially if you can watch for free!
B004FEFS5E|5.0|really explained the light meter in my camera. I'm sure I will be going back to reference the information when needed.
0345529057|5.0|I bought the box set after I became entrenched in the HBO series.  The reading is not overly difficult and provides a better glimpse into the universe than the show.  There are many nuances and minor differences between the show and book universe however, in general the show stays very true to the book.  The biggest exception is probably with the timelines of events.  If you like the show, and you like to read, this series is a can't miss.
B009MYAQK4|5.0|In this book, Paulo Coelho provides the recipe for living your life with courage, presence, purpose, clarity and love. These lessons are taught through a fictional story, but carry the impact and wisdom of your fondest memory of a cherished conversation with a parent, grand parent or other wise elder that shared a lifetime of wisdom and sage advice with you out of nothing more than their purest and deepest love for you.<br /><br />As a parent of two teenage children, I recommend this book to parents as it will teach you lessons you will surely want to pass on to your children. I also recommend this book to those struggling to find peace and courage in their mind, heart and spirit as it will provide you with a refreshing breath of encouragement and remind you all of things that are good and right in the world.<br /><br />I give this book my highest recommendation, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.<br /><br />Rick Petry<br />Founder of the Institute For Urgent Action<br />[...]
B009UZBLSG|5.0|I purchased this to use with my Google Nexus 4.  It worked well and output the display of my phone correctly to my Pioneer AVIC head unit in my car.  Note that slimport technology is different from MHL which is what most android phones use.  Make sure to check with protocol your phone or tablet uses before purchasing one of these connectors.  If you are sure you need a slimport, you won't go wrong with this adapter.
B004CRR9G0|4.0|I am not a huge anime fan but I do love anything that Miyazaki produces. The imagination infused is impressive.
B0072HXVRS|5.0|Schleich creates the most exquistly detailed toys for children.  My daughter loves all of the new Bayala figures.  The beautiful and mysterious Asian entity can only be seen on moonlit nights in the white forests of the Dragon Mountains.  Sometimes, on very rare occasions, it shows itself to the elven children.  Just how it gets to the elves' meadows unseen will likely remain a mystery for ever.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|This is something that I will watch many, many times over the years. I have cut back on my DVD purchases but a few are must-haves. It's been quite a few years since I read The Hobbit so I will not attempt to compare it to the book. I remember how  I loved reading it and this production did not let me down.
B003G8Y4QO|4.0|This is the season that really makes the show great!  I know the earlier seasons can be hard to watch with the cheesy effects & all, but this season does a good job with effects & plot.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play and kill zombies COOL<br />I love this app worth the money I'm ten and I play it all the time. PLEASE GET IT FOR ENTERTAINMENT PLEASE GET IT.
B003R50FRI|4.0|Insight into Indian city life in the slums and criminal gangs was really engaging. Ending was disappointing but expected. Overall a good read.
B0090SI3ZW|4.0|The crew is unbelievable, Batista's part is scary, Crowe is a jack of all trades, Lucy has an amazing presence, and everybody else make it worthwhile...excepto for RZA, he makes slow speeches, and he looks slow on screen
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Fantastic.  Won't say much about the plot so I don't spoil the series.  Must watch...10 is the best Doctor ever.
0545128285|5.0|This book looks really nice, pillowed cover and beautiful paper. The additional commentary on each chapter from Dumbledore is so amazing. Rowling really knows how to write in different voices seamlessly.
1939416019|1.0|Characters have no depth.Book moves too fast, one minute his tending sheep next his adopted by the king who he hardly speaks more than 10 words to yet considers him the father he never had. There is no build up to any event, no background to any of the main characters. Its like Morgan Rice was in hurry a to finish the book. This book is more for 10 to 15 year olds
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Love this movie. The actors are amazing, the story line is timeless. To try and put a stage production in a film is difficult and of course some things have to be changed, but overall this was a fabulous production.
B00AU15HPC|4.0|Justin has always had the gentle voice of the Moodies, the lyrics that balance joy with sadness. Having followed this sound since 1967, it was rewarding to hear that Justin still has a wonderful voice, a song to sing, and, a truth that needs to be heard. Thank you for taking the time to provide a counter-balance to the discordant sounds that surround so much of our daily life now.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|This game is okay and provides distraction while waiting around in a line, for a Dr. apt, etc... But that is really all I expect from a freebie game
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|It was a gripping story, along with stellar acting.  Some scenes may be tough to watch, but I think it's still worth watching.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|bought this for my nephew to go with his budding pocket knife collection I was impressed with the performance and quality of the little sharpener it packs some punch for a little pocket sized unit you could put on a key chain - the only thing that keeps me from giving 5 stars is I have no idea how it is holding up - I would consider getting one myself if the need arises
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is really a tool for the study of God's word. The audio portion is what my wife really likes!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Another well imagined world with compelling characters and a gripping story.  Looking forward to more in this series.  I highly recommend this book.
B005JR3Y5W|3.0|The isn't that bad. It's still on the air so it has to mean something. But not worth buying the show
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Jennifer Lawrence is beautiful all around. She may be getting clumsly because of all the stardom, but good movie. I watched it over 10 times
0743486285|5.0|The book is an incredible journey, detailing Nikki Sixx's decent into his own personal hell. The journal style and additional commentary make for an easy read. Finished it in about a day since I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend for any Crüe fan, or anyone who is struggling with their own addictions (or even if you just know someone who's struggling).  The book will give you a look at the demented mindset of an addict. Great book.
B0095P31L6|5.0|Johnny Depp....what movie isn't he good in. Great movie, but not for kids in my opinion. Many adult jokes within the movie.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|Would not recommend it to anybody.  Real weird is all I can say.<br /><br />The preview i read said that the subject, through math, had discovered the secret or origin of life.  When did that happen in the movie?  After one of his headaches where he starts hitting himself in the head???<br /><br />Sorry, I didn't like it at all.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Play this every evening to unwind.  Really enjoy this twist on the game concept which is similar to bejeweled.  Much more enjoyable.  Thanks!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|It is addicting!! Can't stop playing. Very good for keeping the brain sharp and alert. Definitely a great app to have.
0375851569|5.0|This is a wonderful easy gift for the little boy or girl in your life. I love giving this as a birthday gift.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I have read many military/history books in my life, and I can truly say this is the best one. The story of Adam Brown is so incredibly inspiring, it's truly difficult to put into words. If only our nation had more men like him and his brothers in arms......
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I play this every day I'm hooked on it its better then the first one.my whole family plays this .
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|Dark dark dark but compelling. This series may be reaching it's end point. Eventually there will be no credible way to save him.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|i like it! A new twist to bingo i just love playing it, a nice way to pass my time.
B009K0P10K|5.0|It keeps you guessing what will happen next. Good acting and a great series I think. Give it a try & I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B002UZCJ8Y|5.0|didn't get yet but saw the movie was very good sort a like the matrix only you know that the strong one is the one you want to use they know at home they are real don't remember much about the end
B000006045|5.0|Massive Attack is by and far my favorite band, and I enjoy all types of music, not just of the trip-hop genre. I only came across them 2 yrs ago and have been addicted to them ever since. My favorite album is Mezzanine but I can honestly say that I love each and every song they ever produced.  Personal favorites are \\"Angel\\", \\"Inertia Creeps,\\" \\"Mezzanine\\", \\"Dissolved Girl\\", \\"Black Milk\\", \\"Heat Miser,\\" \\"Safe From Harm\\", \\"Daydreaming\\", \\"Blue Lines\\",\\"Live with Me,\\" \\"Special Cases,\\", and the list just keeps going on and on from there. I've been listening to their Collected Album for the past year in my car and I'm still not sick of it. Their music is simply undescribable and incredibly original. Robert \\"3D\\" Del Naja's voice is sensational, incredibly sexy and can't be compared to anyone else. Check out the track \\"Inertia Creeps\\" on the Mezzanine album and you'll get a sense of what I'm talking about. Also their collaborations with various lead vocalists are simply awesome and smart, and there are many out there. While some of their songs may be considered \\"darker\\" than others, I have to say that all of their music puts me in a great mood, pumps me up and also helps me relax. Their most recent album Heligoland is definitely much different then their prior albums (but then again all MA albums are different; why I love them so much), and it took a little while getting used to. But after listening to it for a bit I became addicted to that album as well. The only album I don't have is Blue Lines, which I just purchased, al though I'm familiar with all the tracks on the album. Bottom-line is Massive Attack is amazing and in my opinion so highly under-rated here in the states. You will never find another band out there quite like Massive Attack. Their sound is so unique and versatile and can't be compared to other bands that share the trip-hop genre, such as Portishead, Morcheeba, Tricky, etc,. Don't get me wrong I'm a fan of these groups as well but their music is no where near as powerful and intense as Massive Attack (in my opinion). I recommmend any and all of MA's  albums to anyone who enjoys refreshing, original music, and music that can't be categorized as falling into one particular genre, but rather an incredible blend of trip hop, alternative hip hop, experimental rock, down-tempo hip-hop, soul, reggae, even classical music.<br /><br />Ok so if you're not familiar with MA's music you are seriously missing out, so I highly recommend that you expose yourself to them already; I guarantee you will not be dissapointed. I suggest you start out with their Collected Album as the compilation will give you an overall sense of their sound; if not that album you can't go wrong with Mezzanine, it's their best!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love the game, I suck at it, but I found the game to be a great way to take up time. I first got it for my 7 year old brother on my phone and started playing to help him pass missions and collect coins, fell in love and then got it for the kindle.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|This game is crack! The ranged attacks could use.some work. Other than that amazing game. Try it its free people
B0074VA2T2|4.0|I put this on my tablet before going to visit the grandkids.  They enjoyed playing this game.  Good for pre-k kids.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was able to read this in 3 days!  I couldn't put it down.  Going to start the next one NOW!  :)
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|Sin City overtones with cartoon excess. Maybe too much violence, but what else is new today. Sean Penn is over the top.
B00BD2DRHW|3.0|Chose the rating based on on the fact I still have to learn more of the game. It allows you to see how strong or weak a bridge is before  selecting a vehicle.
B004ZMWUCU|1.0|Sad describes the horrible existence in this Irish orphanage. Difficult to read, but the story in the present time was sad because I wasted so much time reading it! The folksy voice used to tell the present time story was made even more ridiculous as it clashed against the grey depraved world of the past.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Love this book, which I read after watching NOVA's broadcast of BBC's Michael Mosley program on fasting and the latest medical research in this area. By trying this diet, I have gained more energy and improved my overall weight and vital signs have improved in a relatively short and painless period of time! Highly recommend this approach to dieting as it is healthy, healing and holistic.
B00BZODDYU|5.0|It has been a while since I have seen a good scary movie. It  had me glued to the TV the entire time. I was not disappointed .
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have use Evernote for school, work, personal and job searches. It works great on Windows XP, Win 7, Web, Android, IPhone and Ubuntu (using the web version) . Still finding new uses for it.
0062082353|1.0|sorry I spent any of my life minutes reading such a poorly done piece of literature. I began to skip over his wife's input and his input was so poor I began browsing half way through. from reading other snipers accounts my belief is that desert sniping is substantially less challenging than jungle sniping. why do we need a JINSA in our country? don't we have an American INSA? that picture of him accepting that award was a turnoff. I would not reccomend this book to anyone.
B005BX3NAA|5.0|I've always beeb a Guns n Roses fan and this CD just reinforced that . It's got all their best hits and I listen to it constantly.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|A wonderful take on a sensitive subject. Great acting. Well thought out characters and very good story.highly recommend this film.
B003XT603Q|4.0|It was my first Murakami book and I'm willing to read others. Beautiful characters, intriguing story, very poetic. I love all the walking around, made me feel like going out for long walks as well.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think this game is great for any horse lover or just wants to have a fun app to play.get the app
B00A5FPQBI|4.0|Like the action and real live representation of people.  But, sometime difficult to understand and captions move a little too quickly.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I had a hard time getting into this book. The back and forth between the main characters was, to put it bluntly, boring. I put the book down several times to start another. Then, once I got through the first part the story was riveting, and worth the wait.  My advice to readers is to slog through the beginning, have patience, it will pay off in the end.
B00005N6KG|4.0|Other headphones only connected together by a wire that are suppose to fit and remain in my ear constantly fell out. Finally realized that my ear canal was a bit small. Saw one of these on a jogger at the gym and decided to try.  They fit great, don't move while jogging or exercising, sound is great, and should have bought this a while back.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is a wonderful ending to the Hunger Games series.  The plot thickens with every page you turn.  Suzanne Collins proved with this series (and this final book), that she has a wonderful imagination that will cature it's readers.
B004KKX80A|5.0|Its an awesome Bey but pretty wild when spinning but you can alter that by changing the position of 2nd fusion wheel.
B0048WQDIE|2.0|From the first page of the story, the events occuring are difficult to comprehend.  There are several time jumps and there are a plethora of characters.  One of the good things about the book is that there is quite a bit of satire in the story that can be entertaining.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Great Product For Gamer<br />But Bass Quality Rate 4/5<br /><br />Non Problem For Games And Movies And Customizable Voice Control...<br />Software Support is Great And User Friendly...
1423140605|5.0|My son has read all the books so far in this series. He loves this type of book. He's always reading.
0316056898|5.0|It's near impossible to laugh at Tina Fey but oh so easy to laugh along with her. She's funny. She's sly. Her humor is intelligent and witty, and in her own clunky way, she's ultra-hip. This collection of short pieces is largely autobiographical, but autobiography as a comedy routine. (\\"I never went to summer camp,\\" she writes, \\"as I was neither underprivileged nor Jewish nor extremely Christian nor obese.\\")<br />She's a great storyteller but her best lines are typically delivered as throwaways, seemingly casual (but carefully planted) asides.  \\"Gay people don't actually try to convert people. That's Jehovah's Witnesses you`re thinking of.\\"  \\"Being chubby for a while ... is a natural phase of life and nothing to be ashamed of. Like puberty or slowly turning into a Republican.\\"  \\"You have to remember that actors are human beings. Which is hard sometimes because they look so much better than human beings.\\"<br /><br />Even serious observations are delivered flippantly, like this one, on why she enjoyed working in the Second City company: \\"The rules of improvisation appealed to me not only as a way of creating comedy, but as a worldview. Studying improvisation literally changed my life. It set me on a career path toward Saturday Night Live. It changed the way I looked at the world, and it's where I met my husband. What has your cult done for you lately?\\"<br /><br />She is at her most serious in discussing what it's like trying to make it as a woman in a world resoundingly tilted toward males:  \\"This is what I tell young women who ask me for career advice. People are going to try to trick you. To make you feel that you are in competition with one another. `You're up for a promotion. If they go with a woman, it'll be between you and Barbara.' Don't be fooled. You're not in competition other women. You're in competition with everyone.\\"<br /><br />She observes (correctly) that different rules apply to male comics and female comics just as they do to male politicians and female politicians.  \\"There was an assumption that I was personally attacking Sarah Palin by impersonating her on TV. No one ever said it was \\"mean\\" when Chevy Chase played Gerald Ford falling down all the time. No one ever accused Dana Carvey or Darrell Hammond or Dan Ackroyd of \\"going too far\\" in their political impressions. You see what I `m getting at here. I am not mean and Mrs. Palin is not fragile. To imply otherwise is a disservice to us both.\\"<br /><br />Many Republicans probably disapprove of Ms. Fey because she doesn't hide her liberalism but her treatment of Sen. McCain (whom she liked) and Gov. Palin (she had a more ambivalent reaction toward her but found positive qualities in her too) in this book is generally respectful and it doesn't seem skewed. \\"I am not mean and Mrs. Palin is not fragile. To imply otherwise is a disservice to us both.\\" These sentences are the key to her treatment of Sarah Palin during Governor Palin's run for the vice presidency in 2008.<br /><br />Is it okay to call Ms. Fey a mensch? Etymologically, the word is related to \\"man,\\" but the dictionary definition of the term is \\"a person of high integrity.\\" That seems to fit her. I know I can get away with calling her \\"my soul Bro.\\"<br />The long and the short of it is that I admire her immensely. She makes me laugh. She's a talent!ale politicians.  \\"There was an assumption that I was personally attacking Sarah Palin by impersonating her on TV.

B000JMKTLO|4.0|This was good, but not as good as Gone Girl.  Her characters are all so flawed, her books are almost scary!
159448385X|5.0|This book is amazing. I recommend this book to everyone. It has everything i desire in a book. Please Read
B004TI5N38|5.0|I love David Baldacci and this was one of his best.  I especially enjoyed this new character and can't wait to read more.
B00136NUG6|5.0|If you grew up in the 70s and 80s and loved this type of music this is a great  buy.  Brings back alot of teenage memories.  I love this group.
B006O5YIMQ|1.0|Everything about this movie was trite, predictable and overwrought.  I strongly caution you not to waste your time or money on it.
B0064MGU98|5.0|After dealing with her husbands scandal I love how she dealt with it and came into her own as this show has progressed. Great character development and I love all the twist and turns. Great show.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game! It's challenging and creative,and, I'm afraid addictive. It's not fast action, more a thinking woman's challenge.
B00BI73CVI|1.0|I could not get past the poor singing, for a musical I expected more. At times the lyrics were so butchered b the poor singing that they were indiscernable.
B00BF11STU|4.0|interesting movie<br />gives you insight as to how things look, the different cultures, the commitment of our military, and other government agencies, etc
B008VBYN80|5.0|You will get addicted trust me. This game is good for passing time or n you just need to play
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Great game very fast for us old people but getting the hang of it and the scores are going up and up
1401322786|5.0|I bought this book simple because I love Mitch and all his previous books. I was most definitely not disappointed! The Time Keeper is extraordinary. You don't run across a book like this every day. Yes, it's a little different but u have give it a chance. And once you do, it's a life lesson to learn and appreciate. Thank you Mitch!!!
0807014273|5.0|This book IS THE ONE - Frankl combines his experience in a concentration camp with his skill as a psychotherapist to discuss<br />the ultimate test of finding meaning in life. It is essential reading. A colleague had spoken of it so often that I had to buy it...and I couldn't put it down. Moving, surprising and illuminating, it changed my perception of overcoming existential obstacles. Read it!
B000HF6ZR0|5.0|if you haven't read the book, you probably won't like the movie. that being said, it's a fairly accurate visualization of the book. both, in my opinion are great. but in my defense, my tastes are askew from that of the movie critics 90% of the time.<br /><br />i would suggest a rental if nothing more.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|A cautionary tale for anyone who ever sucked it up and did what they were &#34;supposed&#34; to do when everything inside screamed otherwise. A truly life saving lesson of living YOUR authentic life, and surrounding yourself with love and loved ones (by biology or choice).
044024613X|3.0|I knew what was going to happen in the beginning.  I think the parents were playing dumb and  didn't want to admit the truth to themselves.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great show...Enjoy each episode, leaves you wanting more...Also enjoy that it is based in Chicago since it is my hometown.
B002Q7JYPC|3.0|I think their work is not as good as it used to be.  I love the Eagles, just disappointed. Diane
B0083Z614S|5.0|Easy read and reminds you of your childhood. It kept you going. I will look for more books by Frances Burnett.
034580404X|2.0|I thought is was romance, not filth. I am disappointed about that. There was so much talk about it but non of it about the actual content.  So be warned future buyers,  it is not a romance novel.  It is porn for women.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|very beautiful graphics.  fun for all ages and easy . good time killer. good job designers! recommend for moms of toddlers
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Hard to remember all the characters but definitely worth reading.  Just finished this book and a good way thru book 3.
B003GK2216|5.0|I like Ken Follett's style of writing. many of his books entwines reality with fiction and one an learn many before unknown historical facts. I also like the way he inter links different characters with one another.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is an awesome movie with great moral values! Not everyone is perfect and you see this in this movie. Take the steps to become closer to our loving and forgiving God!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The visuals are absolutely stunning. The story has an interesting twist at the end that make you wonder what is the real story.. Don't want to spoil it for you :) Just watch it.

B00CDT41RY|3.0|Typical Terantio film. Lots of violence. Story line and plot was ok. Slow moving at parts. J Fox was great... Ok movie..
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This book is as well written as enders game if not better I would highly recommend this book to anyone
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|The movies just dont have the excitment like the older ones.  They have taken away the &#34;special agent&#34; that is bond and made him just another agent.  What happened to magic part that &#34;bond, 007&#34; had in the past!
B00005Q4CS|2.0|Am a recent fan, after seeing The Wrestler and Black Swan, of Darren Aronofsky. As it turns out, those two movies, and I enjoyed them hugely, are like a different director filmed them.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I am a person who doesn't like arcade style games or war craft. This is an intelligent, relaxing, yet competitive good time game. Buy it and enjoy.
B001C46P2K|5.0|This is a mooshie romance story and of little interest, but sets the gold standard for costumes, set design, set decoration, and the best color rendition and camera work of any recent movie.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|A character to smart to be believed, one-dimensional characters, Improbable plot.  Just a poor piece of work and Gresham seems to gloat in pumping out this utter waste of my time.
B0000VD04M|3.0|I like movies about movies being made. And, I'd never seen Depp until Pirate and wanted to see him work earlier in his career. This movie is ok, but just. The behind the scenes aspect is worth the price, though.
B0034G4OYK|5.0|Great for both kids and adults. My son could watch it over and over. He laughed through the entire movie and is funny to adults as well.
0767805712|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. It came sooner than expected, it played with no problem. I've been trying to find this movie everywhere, so I was really happy when I received my package.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|One of the best books I ever read. Very thought provoking and great writing. Could not put the book down.....
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Good song, although I wish they had the full 6 minute+ version. Can't wait to hear more from them off their new album
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I was glued to my seat.  I cried. I laughed.  I feel sad. I was happy.  This movie hit all the emotions and the story line just kept me so captivated.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed all the episodes!  I had missed this when it was aired on television & was able to view the whole season 1,2 &3 on Prime video streaming on my Roku player. Needless to say when I started watching I just kept watching episode after episode!!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I read this book in one day. I could not put it down it had me from the first chapter to the last.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I consistently like Kate Morton's style.  I kept tryiing to guess how this book was going to end but, I didn't see it coming.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This novel is written with great respect for all its characters. The message is beautiful, but not preachy. It is also thoroughly entertaining and well written - you are cheering on the heroes at every stage.
B0089LOG02|4.0|A really good book which for me was about a little known subject in American history.  I liked the way it was written.  The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because I thought that the ending was incredibly rushed and somewhat implausible.
B0095P3ULC|4.0|Pretty good action in the latter half of the movie. A bit annoying that it was slow at the beginning
B000026OHN|5.0|Enlight my days, calm my nerves, and enjoy myself every time. Never to late, never to early, Bach is always welcome in my life.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Miss Rowlings attempt at an adult reading was very poor. I would not buy another one of her books. Bad choice
B005S9EJ14|5.0|End of life, time of refleccions, desicions, unfinish business, look back and wait for the best in a very short time.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Amateur writing. Misspellings are a distraction. Have read good novels for too many years to consider this of interest to me. Sorry!
B0070DOHQS|5.0|This app works perfectly and the price of much better than ones as much as 30 dollars. Highly recommend it. I use it on my Kindle Fire HD.
B00992CF6W|5.0|can you updat mc so we can have fishing rodes and enderman and a anchanting tabel please please I'm begging you so please do the updates me frends whont the updates I'm 14 please
B005EGXTL2|5.0|Emma M<br /><br />Great storyline, very vivid images so you get engrossed in what the characters are doing. A must read for anyone
B0086213XW|5.0|Polley leads us along a modern sophisticated 'meeting cute'- but a very unusual, true, difficult journey unfolds. This observes all characters in ways that prove unexpected, accurate, revelatory- resonant with our own ambiguities & ambivalence...best & worst parts. How remarkable in a US film ! great performnces.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Great movie, lots of action with some funny parts too. I really liked that they kept the language clean and you could let older kids watch with out much worry.
B00B23Z2IE|4.0|I have not listened to this on an audiophile system but it is great music  to travel with. Great soul recording. Highly recommended
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Enjoyed this DVD...music and actig were terrific...second version of this musical we have seen...Geo and DJ and clan<br /><br />Couple more words...all the actors were greattttttttttttttttttttttt....
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I enjoy the keyboard however it can be very wrong at times, even when I hover over the letters precisely. Other than that, the keyboard is pretty good.
