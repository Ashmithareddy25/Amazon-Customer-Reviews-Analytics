B002RI9UBS|5.0|I loved this book, quirky story line but the character depth was a delight. I felt so connected to Pi throughout his story that it was like losing a friend when the book finished. A wonderful read.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|I liked the moving descriptions of difficult life of lower class pepople.<br />I enjoed the beautiful scenes and seasonal changes of the country<br />landscaple.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Great plot line, fantastic acting, well done.  Really brought the viewer from the depths of despair to the rise and defeat of evil.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|It is Iron Man what else do you want?? LOL Great movie looks great on my new TV and is fun!
B00A3AU1U6|5.0|Lux is the newest release from Brian Eno. Eno is known primarily for his musical experiments and collaborations in ambient music, a melange of tonal soundscapes, tape loops and electronic remixing effects. Eno is a pioneer in ambient music, composing some of the best examples of this genre, such as Music for Airports, Discreet Music and Apollo.<br /><br />His recent output, however, has been spotty. The word \\"ambient\\" is derived from the French word for \\"furniture,\\" and like furniture should not be noticed or noticeable. Some of Eno's recent releases have been completely contrary to the spirit of ambient music. The music in Small Craft on a Milk Sea, for example, is \\"in-your-face,\\" loud and cacophonous.<br /><br />Lux, however, is a tour de force. The synthesizers provide a soft, sweeping musical background as spacious as those present in Apollo. The tone of the music is meditative. The mood is quiet and gentle. As in all good ambient music, the tonal structures and signatures cascade one after another, unobtrusively, unnoticeably, and take the listener on a musical journey without the listener even being aware of the music's effect.<br /><br />There are four pieces in this album, appropriately called, Lux 1, Lux 2, Lux 3, and, you guessed it, Lux 4,which total approximately one hour. The album plays as a single composition, and the listener is not even aware when one piece ends and the other begins. That is real ambient music. This is the best, most  authentic piece of ambient music composed in years and is one of Eno's best albums.<br /><br />Limited first editions contain a bonus of four prints, much like the first releases of Eno's Before and After Science, which contained a limited release set of lithographs. These prints appear be computer generated images produced by Eno himself.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Eno's music or ambient music in general you will not want to let this one go.

B004OC07GM|5.0|I am not sure where I heard about this book, maybe Bloomberg, but it refreshed my memory and reminded me of actions I should take in my business.

B001BKVWYG|5.0|I went to see the documentary about this Man & I knew I had to get his music. He is absolutely fantastic. I never even heard of him before the movie. If you haven't seen the documentary it is a must see. You will fall in love with this humble creative genius. A hidden diamond!

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have love John Grishham Books!! Never disappointed in them!! Racketeer was one more Great Book of year of reading every book he has wrote.
0316187216|4.0|I'm a big Abercrombie fan; I love his Circle of the World setting and how he ties all of his books together with recurring characters and references.  While this is technically a stand-alone novel, if a reader isn't familiar with--well, pretty much all of Abercrombie's past books but especially the First Law trilogy and Heroes--then they will miss a lot of good stuff in here.<br /><br />Abercrombie always manages to create great settings, write edge-of-your-seat suspense scenes, and introduce great, gritty, three-dimensional characters.  And while he has all of that here, it doesn't shape up compared to his best works.  I'm in the minority of his fanbase in that I really liked Best Served Cold, moreso than the Heroes.  I prefer both of those to this.<br /><br />One reason is the characters are nowhere near as entertaining as those in past works.  Shy is one of Abercrombie's more likable female protagonists, but her whole \\"I have a dark and secret past\\" storyline, which ultimately isn't that interesting, never did it for me, and she ended up being rather one dimensional in her desire to save her siblings while choosing to ignore what was happening to characters around her, especially her step-dad Lamb (who really is the star of the book.  The cowardly lawyer, Temple, is a stronger character and seems to actually go through some deep character development.  But the duo pale in comparison to Abercrombie's past protagonists.<br /><br />It's the gritty western-ish setting of the Far Country that's the real star of the show, here, as are the supporting characters.  The new supporting characters, like the protagonists, aren't as entertaining to read about as those in past books, though the famed scount Dab Sweet and his stoic ghost companion are welcome additions to the Circle of the World series.  It's the returning characters who steal the show here, some using their real names, some old ones.  Without spoiling anything, it's pretty obvious from the get-go who one of thecharacters are, though for another, only attentive readers will figure out her real identity.<br /><br />Moreso than any other characters, even the lackluster protagonists, this story is about Lamb and everyone's favorite amoral mercenary, Nicomo Cosca.  While there is an incredibly thrilling finale (pretty much as soon as part V begins until the end of the book) involving both these characters, the road getting there often took boring turns, and the payoff for one of the main characters was disappointing, seeming to just set the stage for future books.<br /><br />All in all, a gritty take by Abercrombie on the western.  A solid read, but not one of his best works, as the characterization was pointedly lacking compared to his past works.  I get the feeling Abercrombie is setting us up for another trilogy in his Circle of the World with these standalone novels.  I hope that's the case, and can't wait to see more of his regular cast of characters (perhaps a certain former slave with a chip on her shoulder will be making a reappearance soon?).  Unfortunately, Red Country does little to add anyone new to it, focusing on more familiar faces instead.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I really like playing because I can play one or two games while waiting in line or at a stop light. I love playing while watching TV. I used to go with my mom to play bingo on base where we lived.
B00A757EFW|2.0|Unless you plan on purchasing the full version, don't bother downloading. This version lets you play a level and then cuts out halfway through the 2nd.
B008CP93S0|3.0|This movie had some interesting moments....it's a comedy of sorts.....had a hard time with some of the characters but I don't think it was designed to win any academy awards.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It is great!!  It is everything I was looking for in a cable. Plus, I like to have extras in case others get damaged
B007ELN8Y8|4.0|This movie has many interesting and delightful qualities...those who love film will like it just for the history....it has some great scenes. Maybe slightly too long. Possibly could have used more editing.
B004W2UBYW|2.0|As an Apple fan, I always liked Steve Wozniak more than Steve Jobs. If you've ever read Revolution In The Valley by Andy Hertzfeld, you already know 90% of what's in this book.
B005KPDAN4|5.0|Now that House has concluded, I miss seeing this curmudgeon in new shows. I used a segment of the &#34;phantom arm&#34; episode for a lesson for my gifted in high school.
B003UBTX72|5.0|A fantastic book of a life well lived. Very well written and lots of behind-the-scenes moments. Wow. I had the hardcover version, but the Kindle version is so much easier to read.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|I am a big Liam Nesson fan. Think he is one of our finest living actors, but this movie left me deeply unsatisfied. Unrealistic, my wife didn't even finish watching it. Unsatisfying....though I won't give ending away in case you are really desperate for entertainment.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I purchased this specifically because I wanted to be able to stand up my Kindle next to my bed when I'm trying to fall asleep.  Super lazy of me, I know, but there's something to be said for watching Galapagos on Prime for free while dozing.  The case itself is really lightweight.  I know some people view this as cheap, but it's not -- It's pretty solid without adding to the bulk of the Kindle.  Beyond that, it looks great!  It's sleek and doesn't block the corners of my Fire.<br /><br />Overall, I think the current pricing (about $30) is a great deal.  I think it came out at $50 and I wasn't so keen on that, but I think this is well worth the current. :)
B007CGLRWA|3.0|This movie, again with a fine actor, hits a few nails on the head, but I just couldn't relate to the characters in it. It just &#34;didn't quite get there&#34; as a revealing &#34;teacher deals with education&#34; movie.
B005HSL626|4.0|this game is not bad at all its very very fun<br />just let the juice  squirt out<br />its awesome cutting up fruits you cant get mad at this game
B008IYR2BA|5.0|We don't have Showtime or HBO or wherever this shows first, so we always have to wait for the download. Love it! Always look forward to the new season.
B009ZE27US|1.0|you can test this you can put your finger nail on there and it says 45 31 and junk like that
B007VUA7VO|3.0|I liked the features of this app, but I wish there were more controls. I would like to have it load automatically.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Really good game lots of levels I would definately suggest this game to anyone who enjoys this genre worth the download
B000N2HBSO|5.0|If you went to see the movie Lincoln, you should take the time to read this book. It's remarkable read.
159413586X|5.0|I love the series so this was no exception. I hope she gains in popularity and I'm dying to see the film version.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|This has got to be the best TV/Cable drama I have ever seen. I am very pleased that I bought the blueray version with all the extras that come with it.
B005RUUUAI|4.0|Season 2 continues to hold ones interest in the series.  However, there are 2 or 3 episodes that seem to linger on.
B004DK5CW4|1.0|When I purchased this movie it said it was full screen. When i played it, it was wide screen, which I already have. A waste of my money. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!. I thought I would you would send me my money back or a best the full screen Secretariat I PAID FOR. I'M WAITING!!
B004WR125O|2.0|I love streaming music to my stereo.  Problem is it takes forever to configure, and its ability to pickup wireless is limited.  It was getting horrible signal at the back of my stereo, to put it in the front meant I would have to leave the panel down, which wasn't going to happen.  I bought a USB extension cable so I could bring the adapter to the top of my stereo cabinet to give it a little more help.  That being said, if you can run ethernet to the stereo, I would do it, much less finicky.  And I have kept up with all firmware upgrades to the system, it is just a bit of a half baked product.
B008Y73940|5.0|I've watched this movie many times. I'm not a huge fan of Mathew or Marissa, but this movie is really great.
B00005JMK0|5.0|this is my favorite 80s movie with virginia madsen it was awesome love story and way the soundtrack was on here will sell on dvd or bluray if u guys get this movie back on for sale
B005FISBTO|5.0|For a serious fan it's a must have!  would recomend it for anyone who has watched and enjoyed this series.  It is NOT for kids!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I just got my Kindle Fire but have played this game on my friends ipad, got such a kick out of it that she encouraged me to buy this one. I'm still learning about this game so make a lot of boo-boo's, like shooting the birds out the back & way over the target, but know I will enjoy it more as I learn more.
1469220660|5.0|This was a very good read. I must be honest and say I bought Bared to you about 2 or 3 months ago, but couldn't quite wrap around it. I think I heard too much about it being just like the Trilogy 50 Shades of Gray, but it wasn't. Bared To You and Reflected In You stands all by it's self. I loved the story of Eva and Gideon! Reflected in you kept me talking to myself out loud!! LOL! It held me from the beginning to the exciting end. I can't wait for the next book to see what happens with the lives of Eva and Gideon!Great Job Sylvia!!
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|this was one of the best movies i've seen in a very long time. my girlfriend and i got comfortable and cozy in our condo in chicago. we watched the movie - enjoyed it and agreed that we are comfortable and cozy in a beautiful condo partly because of  the men and women in our military;
1451613512|5.0|I am glad i bought this book. I'm still reading it but so far it is one of the best history books i have ever read. This is NOT a conspiracy book. It is 100% facts on topics of US history that are not discussed in schools. If you love American History then you must read this book.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use my kindle as an alarm clock so the weather app goes hand in hand with the alarm function.  Great screens giving all of the necessary information.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|Never downloaded this app and never will. This isn't  for me. I'm not an Angry Bird, person  and never will be.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|I love classical music, so this was right up my alley. Plus it was a great price. The music is beautiful, and I couldn't have asked for anything better.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Simply incredible! This book in many ways breaks the classic rules of fiction, and of SF books, but this without question is what makes it into a classic. The division of the book into 5 sections, the shifting of main characters, and the gradual unpacking of the mystery means you only truly get a grasp of the bigger picture halfway through the book. And then it gets interesting.... Definitely one of the best reads of 2012!
B002OR0RP0|5.0|I love that movie, it was perfect! The movie came out very clear and the sound was good and my son enjoyed it very much.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing!!This is totally the game I will play on Christmas eve when I'm too excited to go to sleep!!!
B006YC74E8|3.0|I haven't had time to use it yet.  But I will during the holiday.<br />I hope it is easy to use.
B008WOULPK|2.0|Grace's memoir is a little like movies that can't figure out what they want to be and the tone flip flops around, never sticking to one.<br /><br />Coddington clearly has had an amazing life and she shows us a slice of cultural history from the inside and if you are interested in the fashion/modeling world during the early days, you will enjoy the book. However, her personal life is woven in and out of her professional life in a very uneven fashion. She glosses over the most painful parts of her life, but then delves a tiny bit deeper into other parts so you think you're going to get a juicy memoir sometimes, but you never do.<br /><br />Her reporting of the early days is extensive and interesting, as we  move into the current day, she gets less detailed and less interesting. We don't anything about how she really felt about almost anything. It's very detached except when she's talking about how she drew her eyeliner and her cats. In fact, her most passionate and bizarre chapter is all about her cats and to what lengths she goes to in order to take care of them. We get more info on the cats than on her infertility or feelings about it.<br /><br />I did enjoy the parts about the early days of modern modeling, but overall it's just ok. I think the rating system is jacked for making three stars &#34;it's ok&#34; and one star &#34;i hated it&#34; so i'm giving it two stars because it's not that great and it left me with a little sour taste in my mouth. If she really didn't want her personal life in the book, then she should have and could have taken it out and focused on the professional side and made it a stronger book.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I have always loved Kelly Clarkson since she started on American Idol. She is a great singer. She can sing anything! I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this cd. It is one of the best CD's that I have bought in years. Even if you are not a huge fan of hers, you will be after listening to this cd. Keep it up Kelly. I love your music.
B0036OODFU|4.0|Kate Hudson before she got lame: Check, Cameron Crowe at his finest? Check: Nymphets? Check. Faux rock stars? Check. What more do you want? Oh, Frances McDormand who is always awesome.
1451696191|2.0|I can't believe people can relate to a 15-year-old who feels it's necessary to describe even the most mundane and common things (like swirlies), who cries every other page, and who has an unhealthy relationship with a dead Aunt. To top it off: you never know who he's writing these letters to, and if the person is as much a stranger as Charlie says he is, I hope he's been throwing them away unread. The only good character was Patrick. I really liked him and was rooting for him, not Charlie, the entire book.<br /><br />Save yourself the time and read Catcher in the Rye instead.
B009MO5960|1.0|I hate to say this but do yourself a big favor and avoid this movie at all costs.  I meant to see this in the theater since I'm a huge fan of the series, bought them all on DVD then blu-ray, but it only lasted a week or so in town before it was removed so I had to wait until the blu-ray release, so I've been anxiously waiting to finally watch it.  I should've rented it instead of pre-ordering.  Talk about one of the biggest disappointments in cinematic history, and a huge waste of my time and money.<br /><br />I watched this tonight with a friend of mine who's also a big fan of the series, and sadly we were laughing our way through this film at all the unintentionally funny scenes that were simply too cheesy or ludicrous even for this series.  It took about half an hour into it before it began making even a semblance of any sense, but even then there were still enough plot holes to fill the Titanic.<br /><br />I haven't played the games hardly at all, so I came into this series because it looked intriguing but I didn't have any pre-conceived notions of what they should be like or about, whereas most of the games' fans dislike the films because they're not close to the game story-line at all.  I came in with an open mind and I've been pleasantly surprised by all of these movies, up until this one.  I even researched the Internet Movie Database to try to figure out what the heck happened to take a popular, well-established franchise and then completely screw up the story, but I haven't really found any answers other than seeing that my voice isn't alone on this.<br /><br />There's really no character development to speak of, which there was plenty of in the previous films.  There are numerous old characters that come back for no apparent reason, it's explained but it serves little purpose other than tarnishing the memory of their original characters.  It seriously feels like Paul Anderson spent five minutes on writing this 'script' just to quickly cash in on its popularity, because it really doesn't hold a candle to the previous plot lines, characters, dialogue or intrigue.  The plot in 'Retribution' is so convoluted it makes 'Crime & Punishment' look succinct by comparison.<br /><br />About the only redeeming features of the film is the HD cinematography and many of the action sequences.  There are quite simply too many things that are deus ex machina, essentially factors thrown in at random with no discernible explanation for how they came to be.  Granted this series requires a major amount of suspending one's disbelief but it came to the point where it made James Bond movies look plausible.  There were (what looked like) Nazi zombies riding jeeps and zombies from the deep, homages perhaps to old B-movie slasher flicks of the 70s and 80s but completely out of context for this series.<br /><br />It's the first movie of this series where I didn't care one way or the other of how any of it would turn out, or what happened to any of them, because there was no reason to.  The movie moved aimlessly all over the map with no end in sight, and not all that entertaining, either.<br /><br />To make matters worse, the ending was beyond stupid.  Completely nonsensical, over-the-top B-movie ending, with no logical addition to the series.  In terms of cliff-hangers, this one 'jumped the shark', so to speak, in other words it's so completely out of sync with the overall story that it boggles the mind and almost begs to be put out of its misery.<br /><br />How this movie came to be without a serious re-write or questioning by studio-execs will forever remain a mystery (perhaps there is an answer out there, I'd really like to know), or it was simply just out to make a quick buck, of course, but even that doesn't really answer it because the others were huge money makers AND were quite well made, by the same writer/director/producer, no less.  Sadly this will be the last of this series that I will buy without seeing it first, and if there are any more, which Anderson has said there will be, I will definitely only rent it this time around, because this was an unfortunate waste of my time and money and I won't bother to see it again, it's that bad.  Huge, huge disappointment, all the way around, it's really hard to believe it was made by the same guy.  I kind of suspect he hired a ghost writer for this script and just put his name on it, because the difference in quality is night and day.<br /><br />On the bright side I'll take comfort in the fact that I can re-watch the first 4 films on blu-ray and I'll just pretend that this epic failure of a film wasn't made.y more, which Anderson has said there will be, I will definitely only rent it this time around, because this was an unfortunate waste of my time and money and I won't bother to see it again, it's that bad.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|I'm torn on whether this is my favorite or TDK. I love Bane as the villain. I love the holographic cardboard slip case that comes with this. The DVD is great for the kids to take on road trips. The Digital Copy is cool and easy to use on the go.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|My daughter loves all the music by Twilight.  All the movies, except the first, were pretty fantastic as well.  Enjoy!
B000KJT8IG|5.0|I finally broke down and purchased this movie because I am tired of it never being on HBO or any of the other premiums. It's always on demand for $5 but why not own it for a few bucks more? The bonus features are surprisingly nice.
B006GHA9VQ|4.0|T<br />This sequel to Phantom of the Opera. It was a darker story than Phantom but well done. The songs, however were'nt as memerable. But all in all a good musical.

1118156315|4.0|A good book to get you thinking of your own personal equity and brand in personal career management. A good book for the newly initiated in this train of thought. A good refresher for someone who is already there. Two books should be read in advance of this book to ensure you maximise your return on the time investment - &#34;Float You - How to Capitalize on Your Talent by Mconnell, Carmel;&#34; and &#34;Career Detection&#34; by Brian McIvor. The ipad application Business Model Generation is the tool you need to put this into practice!

B0058YPL66|5.0|I never watched it when it was on T.V. my mother said it was really good. I was not disappointed at all just buying it on dvd. The twist and turns kept me watching. I can't wait for season 2.

1932100660|5.0|This book is phenomenal! It just makes \\"sense\\". I read this a few months ago and just bought a few copies to give to relatives, because it is THAT good. One of them just called me to let me know they are reading it and are amazed at how informative this book is on one's health and eating habits.  I am a vegan and while this particular relative asked me if this book is what changed me to vegan, the answer is no; however, it did solidify for me, yet again, why vegan is the way to go. Even if you just check it out from the library...READ, READ, READ it. You will NOT be disappointed!
B008LZHA3G|4.0|There is no doubt that if Dylan wants to say something, he will have the best musicians, the best recording facilities, the best engineers, mixers, masters, etc. Tempest is no exception.<br /><br />There is also no doubt, at least in my mind, that if Dylan doesn't have something he wants to say, wants to tell us, he is not going to make a cd.<br /><br />Every story has a teller, every teller tells a story, and in Tempest Dylan the teller is clearly out in front of the mix - maybe more than ever - at least more than he's been in a long time.<br /><br />And Bob Dylan is nothing if he isn't a story teller. He has been telling stories since his first album. And his stories are always changing - that is why he is still relevant.<br /><br />For awhile now, Dylan has directed his stories to someone - his woman? his country? his God? his devils? his self? his Self? By now, only Dylan knows for sure - or does he?

B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|This is more then a game, its a tool for kids to learn the piano while having fun. Great in time for Christmas. This will keep the kids entertained for hours. The game ran smoothly with no glitches on my nexus 7. Lots of songs included and perfect difficulty levels for even those with no piano experience. I would highly teccomend this! Great job!
B004LWZWGK|3.0|My movie review in a nutshell: Overall a great movie with one of the most intriguing villains who terrorizes the 1% whom are saved by a (former?) one percenter.<br /><br />Now on to the Blu Ray which is hardly mentioned in all these reviews. It was viewed on a home theater PC with Radeon 6570 and total media theater dts-HD MA bitstream passthrough capable via Onkyo receiver to Plasma TV. Picture quality was amazing, even the night scenes with city scapes shone through, truly reference quality. One point that I found slightly distracting is the periodic change in aspect ratio. Movie starts with 1.78(full screen) then switches to 2.40 (black bars present) and this is repeated throughout the movie. I wish they'd stayed with 1.78 which apparently used an Imax camera as I found it to be more immersive. Sound is incredible, Banes voice and even Batman's gruff voice came through clearly and the explosions and the whirl of the Bat were unreal.<br /><br />Finally Ultraviolet is a ripoff. You're forced to sign up with them and after going through hoops you're finally allowed to download a standard definition movie that cannot be played by windows media player or windows media center but only with a rudimentary flixster program that can't even fast forward or advance to the next scene.<br />I'd like to ask the Movie studios why would I want a SD copy of a High definition movie? You've already forced me into buying an unwanted DVD with this combo. I want a high definiton copy that I can stream as I did with Inception. This is the last UV copy I'll be purchasing, if the digital copy cannot be played by media player or isn't high definition I will only purchase Blu rays even if I have to do without the special features (yes, another nice trick Hollywood).<br />My final rating is 4.5 stars for Movie, 5 stars for blu ray and 0 stars for Ultraviolet.

B009HSVHV2|5.0|I love to read the reviews from guys who sit in an office, eat crappy food, and are stressed out.  God forbid, they give a band credit for their longevity in general, let alone the ability to put out a timeless classic like Monster.  It's classic Kiss with a really cool edgey darkness feel...period.  Paul's voice is as perfect as ever and Gene sounds just as good.  Everyone's playing has blended very well over the past few years and the hard work shows.  Seriously, unless you've made millions on top of millions playing music, go back to eating your donuts and shut the $%^& up!! Long live KISS & ROCK N ROLL!
B008MZU8R0|4.0|I like Rush. I don't find this to be there best work. Maybe I'm too stuck in there early music . Still some good music on it.
B005NNVUBM|5.0|Break out your black light and enjoy. This album as a wide stroke. David Gilmour really starts gelling with the band on this LP. I Wish David Gilmour & Roger Waters would get back together a make a new album and tour.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|A very well shot concert. Led Zeppelin can still rock after all these years. Well worth the money. Great to also see behind the scenes rehearsal. 5star in my book
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Very well written. Lovely story and excellent production with a lot of attention to detail. Great Christmas story for everyone.
B001NTLYKC|5.0|Good music. You can tell there having a blast playing it. There are some really stand out classic pieces on this cd
1599290642|5.0|Spectrum 19 carries on the long tradition established by the earlier volumes in this annual series. The Spectrum series offers a wide range of science fiction and fantasy art from a wide variety of artists, styles, and formats. The collective imagination expressed within the covers is profound, disturbing, and delightful.
B000VHPX6I|5.0|I had this as an album and all ways liked it. I was in the mood for Skynyrd one day .I down loaded and found I really enjoyed the alternates cuts. Some are better than the ones that are on the original album.over all great
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Not a fan of all the new updates.. harder to delete posts.  It's not quite as user friendly as the last program was.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|Heartwarming stories. Touching. I laughed and cried. I had heard it was great, but never watched it till now. Hugh Grant was charming g as always.
B000FP2OPY|3.0|Love this show. Missed the beginning of the series so I'm looking forward to trying to catch up and see the bloopers.
B0086700CM|4.0|This review could be 5 stars, but there is one problem. The price of the characters is too high. I mean come on, who the hell is gonna get that money?! It takes weeks if you play a couple of hours a day, and that would be so much wasted time on a game. Just lower the prices, at least just by one 0. Should it really be that hard to unlock a new character?!?
B004LWZWGA|1.0|I kept wanting to give up and turn this movie off, but stupidly kept going, mostly just to finish what I started (and paid for). The action -- especially fight sequences -- are crudely choreographed and never build any intensity through rhythm or suspense. Partly, the failure is due to a bunch of over-long, blubbering Michael Cain scenes where a respectable old man comes off as a whiny 11-year-old. Similarly, lots of disjointed flashback sequences try to lend depth to the villain Bain, but even behind the mask his character rarely gets better than some unknown WWF contender. The one exception there might be the slightly uncomfortable speech he gives at Black Gate prison, where he's obviously channeling some of the rhetoric of Occupy Wall Street. Nobody in the film is buying his adoption of populist rhetoric for a suicide mission to blow up the entire city (with its populace) for no other reason than personal, not even ideological, revenge. The speech has a bit of force to it, on its own, but feels like painting Occupy as violent thugs by borrowing some of their talking points or style. Notably, you never see any sequence explaining how even one member of the Gotham mobs, let alone a major or minor character, gets convinced by it -- and neither should anyone in real life come away fooled that Bain's violence has any connection to Occupy. The film could have been a bit more interestingly disturbing, had Bain taken Occupy positions to heart and crafted a plan that has anything to do with working-class interests. Instead, he's a back-handed shill for whiney aristocrats to take down (Batman / Wane) or be victimized by (everyone else).
B007N9FKCY|4.0|This game is for all ages. I(49), son(31), granddaughter(9) all played this game and liked it. Awesome graphics and background  display
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|Love this movie. My kids love it as well. Bought this one for a friend's birthday, which I am sure he is going to LOVE! Wonderful movie for kids and adults. Such a sweet movie and even has a decent storyline and moral.
0525953728|5.0|I'm thankful to have guys like this write a book and tell the truth about what happens overseas. If you like military action books then you'll love this unforgettable book. I'm not giving out any hints about the book other then it's a must buy.
B006OITIQE|3.0|my girls loved this at first. but now they are tired of one direction. we are so over all this hype.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|This movie is loaded with action from the beginning to the end, and with little dialogue. There isn't the awe factor that was in the first Arnold S. movie, but it seems that the producer didn't go for anything novel. Still a good movie to watch.
0385535147|5.0|I have read every book this author has written and I believe that this book might be his best one ever.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Absolutely hilarious!! Ive already seen the movie like 4 times and im about to watch ot again! Definitely worth the purchase!!
B007GE2H3G|5.0|Long time Tintin fan, but haven't visited this wonderful world in many years.. Watching this was a testament to how Herges characters and landscapes hold up through the years. Five stars without hesitation. I can only hope for more of these to be made soon!<br />OH, AND BY THE WAY: Anybody notice the striking resemblance of Tintin to the real life Simon Pegg?!? I knew I recognized him from somewhere, and then looked up Simon Pegg to refresh my memory, I clicked on the Shaun of the Dead trailer, and BAM! TINTIN! Haha, I wonder if it's just me, of if they really did model Tintin after Simon. I'd love to hear others' opinions.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I thought there was too much emphasis on his personal life and medical condition. He went into great technical detail in  regard to the latter.<br /><br />I felt his description of heaven was sketchy, I really could not comprehend his description of heaven. I also felt that his experience was purely anecdotal and fell way short of proving there is a heaven.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|It's a good movie. Well worth the money spent. If you enjoy mysteries then either rent or buy this movie.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Though I was spell bound  by this book, I am concerned that it may give a wrong impression to young girls that they too can trust a perfect stranger in a bar with their life.  This is a fairy tale, in real life she could have ended up dead.
B00AHSINKO|4.0|Didn't know what to expect. Chose the movie based on the actors. It did not disappoint. I like movies. And, this was a somewhat dark comedy.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved reading from Enzo's viewpoint.  Written with humor, compassion and wisdom<br />in the life of his humans.  Loved that Enzo &#34;came back&#34;

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham did it again. Could hardly put the book down. Time to go back and start reading all of his work again.
B009A87ZQU|1.0|I recently rewatched this film to see if perhaps I overlooked what others have been saying is a great movie.  What could they possibly like about Casino Royale?<br /><br />Daniel Craig is a horrible choice as James Bond.  He has no charisma, charm or chemistry with the Bond girls.  There wasn't an exciting Pre-title sequence, zero gadgets and the Aston Martin gets flipped over in a chase?  What on earth were the screenwriters thinking?  Moreover, the poker game takes up a good chunk of this movie and it is long and boring.  The one other action scene involves a construction site where Craig is doing a series of jumps and climbs onto and off of cranes.  In all honesty, it felt like another movie all together.  Couldn't the writers think of something better?
B005IZLPMY|5.0|When the movie came out, I didn't expect much from a super hero without super powers like flight or gamma radiation. Marvel did a great job making this movie entertaining and well told. In the end, I wanted to see more. 5 stars.
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|Great movie!  Good for the kids, and parents too.  I previously had this movie and the disc got messed up, so I had to buy another one for sure!
B0053O89RY|5.0|This show is always funny and well put together every episode. Other similar shows feel like they are trying too hard to create humor and it feels fake. The comedy of Modern Family always feels real and in most cases surprising. The show has some of the best writers and actors and I give it 5 stars.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app, easy to use on the kindle fire. No issues so far! Much better then using my smart phone.

B003R4ZMNQ|4.0|One of my favorite TV series. I enjoyed watching the season again. I did not give it five stars because the deleted scenes do not work on all the disk.

B0096HIEE2|5.0|The men in this movie are hot hot hot!!! Although, there really wasn't much of a plot. Every woman needs to watch it!!
B00004TDTO|5.0|One of the best funnest movies. If you haven't seen it, please do. Now I have to write 7 more words: here they are.
0345803485|1.0|Where do I start? Remember all the sex that we didn't see in twilight? Well it was all here. That's it. Just sex. Let me just say, I have never hated a story much like I hate this one. I never thought someone could write something so disgusting, so repulsive, so ridiculous and pathetic that I would actually wish that I had never even heard of the story. If I could, I would give it negative five stars!<br /><br />Lets start with Ana. I hated her so much, I just wanted her to suffer a long, horrilbe, painful death! I have never seen a more pathetic heroine. Comparing her to Bella from Twilight would be a huge insult to Bella. At least I actually have some respect for Bella. She was with a man who loved her and respected her. Ana, on top of being deplorable and having little sefl-respect, is about as interesting as watching grass grow. Her subconscious and inner goddess have more personality than her. I have never read a story with such a dull and depressing female lead. She didn't even have an interesting background.<br /><br />This horrible man, Christain Grey, was the worst excuse for a male lead that I have ever seen. So many times I wished that Ana would just hit his stupid head with something really hard, but of course, she never did. She could barely say two words around him, she would just bite her lip and look down at her knotted fingers in her lap. She was so intimitaded by him, and thought he was too good for her, while I thought he was the worst excuse for a human life form.<br /><br />She shamelessly let him use her body for his own pleasure, yet he claimed that he was doing it all for her. Like he knew what was best for her or something. And instead of showing a single shred of pride and dignity and standing up for herself, she proved over and over again that she was pathetic enough to be his submissive.<br /><br />So this man claims to love this woman, yet he wants her to be his submissive? He wants to her to be his personal sex slave, and on top of thathe has all these rules on her. She can't look at him, she can't touch him, she can only wear clothes that he picks out for her...basically she can't breath unless he says so. I wanted so bad to just throw this freaking story at the wall, but I was reading it on my laptop and I didn't want to ruin it because of a rediculous story like this. The only reason I finished it was so that I could come on here and write a review warning people to stay away from it.<br /><br />I honestly don't see how anyone can like, let alone love, this book. I could feel myself seething the whole while reading it. If a story like this isn't offensive to women then I don't know what is. Not to mention this is supposed to be a \\"love\\" story, yet there was no love or romance what so ever. My favorite part was the ending. I won't ruin it here, but I liked it. And if you've already read it then you understand why.
B00005RHGK|5.0|I've just always liked this movie and the actors in it. Had to buy it for my own collection. Well done creepiness.
B008673ZAQ|1.0|I read fifty shades and i was completely disgusted with it, like an all new level. then i came across this book and i heard that it was like fifty shades, but better. so i gave it a try. i didn't love the first book, i didn't even like it. but it was okay, so i decided to give this book a try.<br /><br />i haven't even finished it yet, but i can say that this book is seriously a disappointment. in the first book, i compared Gideon and Eva to Christain and Ana, and i liked Gideon and Eva a whole lot more. i felt that in the first book Eva was stronger, the characters were more interesting, and their relationship was developing.<br /><br />I didn't see any of that in this book. Eva was totally pathetic. she talked of her independence, but i didn't see it. her \\"right to say no was her greatest power\\" or whatever, and yet she never used that power. she let gideon do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted, and she never once said no. she didn't prove to be a strong heroine to me. in fact, she was no better than Ana. he said that he's the one who decides when they have sex, and she just sat back and accepted it. she barely fought to prove herself, she just sat back and took all the abuse he gave her.<br /><br />As for Gideon, i hated his possessiveness, obsessiveness, and controllingness. He treated her like a child, not allowing her to go anywhere by herself. his chauffeur drove her to and from work. she wasn't allowed to go anywhere without him, and if she did she had to use his vehicles, and only go to places he owned. and yes, she tried to fight back against his control, but all she did was put up a meek argument that she never even won. does that sound like a strong, independent woman to you? not to mention he was always hiding things from her, like she's not mature enough to handle the truth about him or something, and on top of that he was asking others to tip toe around her because \\"he knows how she gets\\". he has like zero respect for her, and has shown to care little about her opinion since she didn't seem to have much of a say in anything.<br /><br />one of the things that annoyed me the most was that when they were alone, they had sex. when they were tired, they had sex. when they were hungry, they had sex. when they were mad, they had sex. if they were in the same room period, they had sex. it got really old and really pointless. their entire relationship was just based on sex, and yet they were trying to convince me that they were in love? i don't think so. they tried to use sex to deal with all of their problems, which of course only made them worse.<br /><br />usually when i like a book, i don't skip a single sylable while reading it. in this book, i found myself skipping pages and pages and pages because i just didn't care at all about it. i just wanted to get to the interesting parts. at this point i'm not sure if i'll read the third book, or if i'll even finish this one.<br /><br />it surprises me that female authors display women like this, and it's really disappointing when i read stories with heroines like this, ones that are childish, clingy, dependent, and not at all smart or mature. i expected more out of this author since i've read so many good reviews about her, but these characters and this whole story has ruined my opinion of her. if i was allowed to give this book zero stars, then i would.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|A great way to pass time. Very fun,the sounds the birds make when they hit the grown,is so funny. I thought it would be a childish game,but I was wrong,I love playing it.

0525953728|5.0|As &#34;this is my story&#34; books go, this one is better than most.  I've touted it to several others just in the week or so since I finished it.  This retired Seal who was on the OBL mission (Osama Bin Laden) tells of the training of the Navy Seals; their cameraderie; their commitment and discipline; their life out on the military frontier.  Not only does it describe the OBL mission in detail, but also the rescue mission in the sea off Somalia where the Seals sniped three pirates from the stern of a U.S. Naval ship freeing Captain Phillips.  (I understand this mission is the subject of a new Hollywood movie.)  The author has changed all names including his own and emphasizes that no secrets are divulged.  All tactics described are common knowledge among among the Afghan insurgents and the organized military, so he says.
030758836X|1.0|I thought it one of the worst books I've read. It is well written, but the character of the wife is so reprehensible, that if she would have been struck dead, I would have cheered. Sorry I wasted my time reading it. It left a really bad taste in my mouth. C.A.G.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Not much to say other than this app does what it's supposed to do and does it well. It's very useful for power users that use their Fire hours per day and need to know if enough of a charge is left to get through the day. I like the percentage measurements given as opposed to the stock battery icon and the usage graph gives a good idea of what type of usage has how much of an impact on battery life. Sure there may be some room for improvements but for the price this app delivers more than enough. This is certainly a worthy app for all Fire owners to have in their library.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book was so transparent that a reader knows exactly what happened from the very beginning of the book and seems like a cheap cop-out on the part of the author at the end.
B000RF7XYO|4.0|I was curious about that Elizabeth went through w/ her life as queen when she was so young. She was good person & sometime mean to her woman who served to her cuz she was jealous. Wow, it was true story. I love to watch true story.  Thanks.

1451683405|5.0|Amazing to read. Makes logical and insightful points about our illusion of free will. This book is not just for deterministic behaviorists as Sam Harris himself is highly entrenched in neuroscience and the cognitive aspect of things. Regardless of his reasoning for the &#34;illusion&#34; there is much to agree with (or question) on the nature/nurture continuum.  A delight for either side.Quick read as it is a short book  (about 70 pages). Great detailed resources for the things he postulates in the notes section at the back of the book. Great job at citing his sources instead of just assuming the reader will take him at his word.

B00A0SKFLG|5.0|A very tightly woven action flick. To fluff, no padding, pretty much non-stop action from start to finish. Comparisons to the Arnie version make the same mistake as with True Grit - neither are remakes but adaptations on the same original novel/short-story. Philip K Dick, who's amazing imagination sparked so many sic-fi movies, wrote this tale, this is a movie adaptation of it. THIS adaptation is closer to P.K.D's story than the previous version. It borrows from other movies but does so obviously in a respectful homage kind of way: we have Blade Runner (also Philip K. Dick), we have Fifth Element and we have I Robot - the overall feel gets it right with a more 1984 Orwellian feel. Oppression is the correct feel, and we get it here, but not in the Arnie over sanitized, over-acted version. And who said Colin Farrell is no Arnie? i hope not - good for his time but Arnie isn't like anyone except a pro-wrestler or bodybuilder - spies, commandoes, special forces guys - none of them look like over preened gym rats. Farrell does an excellent, low key job. Plus one of the core messages, about who we really are, that Mr. K Dick likes to weave in, isn't lost in this version. Not a classic but a good romp - I recommend you watch it...
B009E3EY38|5.0|27 years after the band disbanded, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and Robert Plant still have the chemistry between them. Surprisingly, the 3 surviving members along with Jason Bonham created some of the definitive versions of some of these songs. Worth multiple listens and multiple views
B003QTSMXE|5.0|There's not much to say that hasn't already been said - excellent movie! Strong message for adults who see - what is tongue-in-cheek set in the far future - happening now! They can speculate on that while enjoying an innocent love story, and of course enjoying the many amusing moments. Kids will enjoy the latter, and many will get the other message about Western society (children are always smarter than we give them credit for). Who wouldn't like this movie?
B0096DZKZC|3.0|this game went for .99&cent; when it used to be 6.99 i dont know if its on sale or if it just dropped
B0059XTUVI|3.0|Streep once again proves that she is a A list actor. She made lemons out of lemonade though because she worked with a really odd script. The flashbacks from her youth to her middle age to her old age with Alzheimers (presumably) was a weird choice. I didn't follow politics in the days when Thatcher was prime minister. I learned a lot about British conflicts from this movie and looked up more information. It was then that I became outraged at the portrayal of this fine, brave, lady. It left me wondering why the writers wanted to show her as iron, uncompromising, weak, wrong-headed and infirm when there was so much more to her than that. If you view it as entertainment, you will probably be satisfied. The cast does a great job. If you view it as a piece of history, please don't stop here at this lopsided portrayal. Use is as a jumping off point to learn more.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|I chose this movie because I like Jeremy Renner's work and since he was in this, I wanted to see it. I thought it was a big improvement over other Bourne movies, because it seemed more believable, although the wolf fight scene was a bit extreme, I still loved it. Also things in the movie seemed to flow better from one scene to the next. It was entertaining and kept my interest through the entire movie. I liked the chemistry between the characters and the sets in the Phillipines were great, especially the motorcycle chase scene. Loved it and look forward to next one.

0785163174|5.0|No need for a lot of words...fricking amazing should suffice.  My only beef is that the Avengers are always portrayed as more powerful and noble, annoying because they came across as winning most fights unless the X-men cheated which made the X-men look weaker than they are and the X-men were made to look like the bad guys here which was complete BS.  Just my opinion...GO X-MEN, LOL!!!

B009NET0H8|5.0|Never heard of her before I saw this book on Amazon.  It's on my Kindle app and the pix come through sharp.  Maier had an eye for the fascinating amidst the ordinary.  Much like a few of Arbus's photos.  Actually I don't think I had seen the term \\"street photography in print until I saw this on Amazon.  Only issue is that the print on the few pages of text up front is extremely small and hard, at best, to read.  Part of my reason for getting the book was that Geoff Dyer wrote a preface (and if you haven't read The Ongoing Moment& by Geoff Dyer, order it this second..[[ASIN:1400031680 The Ongoing Moment]] ).  I couldn't increase the font size in the Maier book and got a bit of a headache trying to read it.  Worth the pain, though.

0374533571|5.0|Without the possibility of a happy ending, what would life be? Pat Peoples, recently released from a mental institution, is look for the happy ending to the movie that is his life, a silver lining peaking out from the gray clouds hanging above him. He wants to re-assimilate himself into society, build a better relationship with his family, and prove to his wife Nikki that he is a changed man. But God clearly has something else planned when He throws Tiffany, an equally damaged and rough-around-the-edges type of person, into Pat's life.<br /><br />Endearing, sad, even bitingly funny, this book -- much like the David O. Russell film crafted from it -- is easy to swallow yet complex in the emotions it makes you feel. Do yourself a favor and give this one a chance; it just may be the silver lining you've been searching for.
B001DHXT20|5.0|Great Price. Arrived Promptly. purchased as Christmas Gift for a 3 Year, who Loves anything Hulk.<br />Would Highly Recommend this DVD.

B007XKEY6Q|2.0|It was okay....I think this is for someone younger. I really did not undertand this one but I will keep it.
0374214913|4.0|A fun, engaging novel about the intersection of technology with old world knowledge.  It's a fast read that raises some interesting questions about the human struggle with mortality.  The characters are likeable and there's a heart and humor to the book that takes it beyond the simple mystery plot.  I'd recommend this for the young adult to early adult reader (middle school through early 20s) as the characters are likely to resonate the most with a younger age group.  It's enjoyable for the older reader as well, but somehow feels as if you're revisiting a childhood adventure story.  I wonder if the technology in the book will seem obsolete even in the near future, but enjoyed how the author seemed to be using technology in the story to make the point that it can coexist and even enhance our traditional methods of learning and preserving knowledge.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love to play Angry birds....I am going to download more. I can't stop playing it.  Now if I could master all the levels.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I brought this on board with me on a recent flight from the US to Malaysia.  A full 24 hours just inside an aircraft.  This item was a life saver as it allowed me to keep my smartphone fully charged while I either watched movies, listened to music or played games.<br /><br />About the same size as a pack of playing cards and it holds as much juice as claimed.  It has two ports for charging; one at 1mW and one at 2mW.  The second port charges faster than my wall wort charger - NICE!
B0000033IS|5.0|It is very hard to try and find oldies but goodies.  Aretha has always been on of my favorite singer.
0345525558|4.0|This is an enjoyable fast read using flowers as an interesting hook on an old theme.  This is not a 4 star piece of classic literature with complex themes but it is a 4 star easy breezy feel good book when that is your mood.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|This is a treat for anybody who enjoys a &#34;heist&#34; job, complete with an international element, fine performances by a great cast, and some cool stunt driving.  Good cinematography, too.
B000002LBH|5.0|This is essentially a compilation album of The Smiths various single/flip side only releases that didn't appear on any of their formal albums, although a few of them did appear on Hatful of Hollow.  I love this CD, and if you love The Smiths, it is essential you must own it.
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|This was a cute movie for a rainy night.  Good for ages 10+ yet entertaining enough for adults to watch without getting bored.
B00004YW6I|5.0|PJ Harvey has two masterpieces, To Bring You My Love, and Stories From The City Stories from the Sea.  I first bought this CD back in 2000 when it came out, but I forgot I loaned it to somebody I use to work with long ago, but can no longer remember whom it was.  I now live in another state and finally got around to buying a copy off Amazon, upon listening to it, I  again found this CD to be a brilliant masterwork. PJ has done nothing even close to being really good since this CD.
B009GEAWOU|2.0|If you've watched this show continuously for a while as I have you'll clearly see that it's a major rehash. To the point that while before I didn't care if we ever met the damn mother... Now I beg for it! End it. Now!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|We all need to know more about the thinking of our greatest President.  His relationships with his cabinet are so beautifully described by Doris Kearns Goodwin.  The personal backgrounds and political careers of each of these men were so crucial to Lincoln's success as a President.  Yes they were rivals and he was our leader.  So much of this book points to our current struggles for equality in America... quoting:<br />Lincoln understood that the greatest challenge for a leader in a democratic society is to educate public opinion.  &#34;With public sentiment, nothing can fail; without it nothing can succeed,&#34; he said.  &#34;Consequently he who moulds public sentiment goes deeper than he who enacts statutes or pronounces decisions.&#34;
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Through the genre of historic fiction Winter of the World really personalizes the experience and drama of WWII. By using the  life experiences of the characters and families of the first book in the trilogy, the reader learns how WWII was the logical and tragic continuation of the horror and blunder of the Great War. You will learn how the Nazi horror came to be as a result of vengeful and shortsighted actions of the allied powers at the conclusion of WWI. The reader will see that contrasted with the brilliantly concieved and executed program called the Marshal Plan that the allies used to rebuild western Europe after WWII.<br /><br />It may be fiction but Follet weaves these characters into the real fabric of history to make it live for the lucky reader.<br /><br />I can't wait for the third book. Come on Ken, let's get it out there.
B004S5C91Q|5.0|I couldn't put this book down for the life of me. It had me hooked from the first page and it made me cry at the end. Highly recommend!
B0049IHX2C|5.0|THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR BOOK. MY DAUGHTER LOVED IT  SHE WILL BE READING MANY MORE THANK YOU AGAIN
030759565X|5.0|If you like her blog you will love her book.  Every recipe comes with a picture and the book stays open while you're cooking so you don't have to worry about keeping it flat while your hands are dirty.  My guests have raved about everything I've made so far.
B0076DELIG|5.0|His books are easy read and as always, leave you hanging until the end.  Harry Bosch is definitely the type of detective you want.  He always finds the thread that ties everything together.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|Game is like a paino version of rock band or guitar hero. Pretty addicting. Game is kind of hard on a phone though. Would best suited for a tab since the black keys are so little and when two keys are righ next to eachother it makes it nearly impossible to hit. 5 stars for the number of songs and entertainment this morning.
B008N1V11U|4.0|how much space does it take up gameloft? I need to know cause my brother wants to play this game with me but I need to know how much space it takes up so when I download it I need to know so I don't have to delete anything.
020530902X|5.0|This was a great item! Just as advertised! Will definitely do business again in the near future! Keep up the good work! Gr8 amazoner!
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I am still working my way through this book.  I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie.  So far no connection to any of the movie trailers I have seen.  Beginning of the book focusing on a Bishop is a very poor city.  I will keep working on the book but the movie will probably have to wait until its on DVD.  I will update later.
B005HY1P94|5.0|Of course, I like Lindsey Shaw, but special mention should be made for Meaghan Jette Martin.  The two have chemistry together and the series should not have ended so shortly.
0307592731|5.0|Strong writing, strong subject, unabashed honesty are all marks of this stunning read.<br />  I was slow in becoming involved in her story.  Her pre-journey chapters left me uncomfortable.  But, as I continued I became absorbed, walked alongside her. Her emotions were mine.  Her story could only be honest, it was so raw.<br />  As a reader, I felt her growth; I cheered her on.  I willed her to get through the pain, the dangers.  If she talked of sexual urges and carried condom(s), well-she was 26 years old!  She also did heroin, but on the trail, she rejected it.<br />  I cried as I read her acknowledgments, then closed the back cover and said, aloud, WOW! To know she found happiness and contentment meant a lot to me. I have a select list of friends who will thank me for recommending WILD.
B003CI90MQ|5.0|I simply love this book.  One of the rare books that actually give you tips you can use and understand.  I recommend this to ALL photographers.  This book is good for beginners and experts alike.  If you purchase this you will not regret it.  I now want ALL of the series of books.
B00005JKG7|5.0|I love the way The Fog is made.  It is not one of Carpenter's best films, The Thing is problaly that one, but it is a very professionally done film. Time out, most films are professionally done, I mean the way Carpenter uses music, story, and editing is exeptional in this film.  The Fog was not very popular film when it came out, but the public was expecting gore and killers from the man who made Halloween.  The Fog is just a ghost story,  It use stock characters, stock plot devices, and uses the most common of story lines[coming back from the dead for revenge].<br />That is why critics of the day hated this movie.  They said it was not original, just a rehash.<br /><br />I teach fillm studies at my high school and I use The Fog as example of technical film making at its best.  This where The Fog shines.  There are only two ways a movie can maniputlate the audience, sight and sound. Carpenter uses these two senses ways that make one scream and jump even though we know what will happen next.<br /><br />The openning is good example of setting up the audience.  The camp fire and the telling of a ghost story puts us in a comfortable space where we are willing to belive the following story.  Carpenter uses kids huddled around a campfire listening to an old man to begin to make us nervous.  We know the basics of the old man's story because we have heard it many times before, but.....we still find ourselves getting caught up in it.<br /><br />Carpenter uses old ladies, children. and beautiful women in danger to makes us squirm in our seats.  Carpenter never really shows the ghost and lets our imagination create far more scarier creatures.  If you are looking for blood and violence they are here but not shown.  No that is a movie trick that is far harder to do, lead you up to the blood and the gore and stop, letting your mind finish it.<br /><br />However for me, it is Carpenter's use of music that I find the most interesting.  Carpenter, for the most part, wrote his own music for his films.  Now remember I stated that sight and sound are the two ways to manipulate a person with film.  Carpenter here uses up to 3or 4 \\"music\\" sound tracks.  One track is the music which is usually only 4 or 5 note melody played over and over AND slightlly out of tune enough to bother the ear.  There will be another track of one continous sound low in the background to kee[ our ear out of balance. Then there will be a third or fourth track where there will be a loud repeating sound for a short time. Put all of these together and the viewer never gets comfortable.<br /><br />Finally there is the \\"gotta ya\\" scene.  In The Fog there is a scene in boat and another one at the doctor's office where the viewer says to himselves the body will come out and scare them.  You know it will happen and you wait for it and you say now, now, now  and it doesn't happen.  The you start to relax and bang gotta ya! The Fog,if one will watch for it is a technical fillm making, will be reward, or hell just watch and jump.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|A must read!! The book series is turning out to b  more of a beauty and the beast tale! Highly recommended!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am absolutely in love with pinterest! Whether I need ideas on outfits, the next meal for a dinner party, or a new way to use old stuff I can find it on pinterest!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book and the books after are awesome. I loved these books they are a pretty easy read but interesting. I don't however think they are appropriate for younger readers.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|This is a great, appropriate app to play and listen to all of your favorite Christmas songs! There are so many songs to choose from. Just look at the Product Info.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book and the books after are awesome. I loved these books they are a pretty easy read but interesting. I don't however think they are appropriate for younger readers.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This game us fun until the levels are more than challenging; they are impossible.  It goes beyond skill.  But it is fun.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book and the books after are awesome. I loved these books they are a pretty easy read but interesting. I don't however think they are appropriate for younger readers.
B00A757EFW|2.0|This game is too difficult to be relaxing.  A fast-paced game that is better with a joystick rather than a finger;  Kidas would be more entetained by it.  Just makes me frustrated.
B009MF56GC|4.0|The plot is a bit lame, the lines are a bit cheesy, but that is part of the fun of this movie.  All great actors just going at it with explosions and bullets flying.  Action flick fans eat this movie up and has a lot of replay value.
B00A757EFW|3.0|I haven't played this in years. Just need practice on moving pacman faster but still a fun game to play.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|h a p p y  w i t h  p u r c h a s e ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
B00A757EFW|3.0|LOVE Pac-Man!! I don't like the controls. Hard to get pac-man to go where you want him to. Other than that it would be a great game!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|This is one fantastic movie.  It has the viewer asking so many questions and waiting for the next movie to come out and explain the why.
B000002IQW|5.0|This cd is a must for all the hardrockers out there. Sabastian can really rip the words right out of the songs.
B004EPZ07U|5.0|Should have gotten better views on the Big Screen because it has much to offer to the viewer.  Should be included with the Avengers or the other group of protectors of the comic book characters
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I loved this book. I couldn't put it down from the very first page. Ready to read the next one.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|The movie was just great.  It showed the how and why of the Bourne series.  Gives the viewer so much to root for and knows that someday there will be another one coming
0385535147|5.0|As always, John Grisham keeps you guessing until the last few pages just what's going to happen next.  A thoroughly enjoyable read!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|love this game for whenever I need to relax and wait at Dr office or airport . really like the colorsans ease of use!  don't change it
0399160450|5.0|Tom Clancy has a knack for keeping you at the edge of your seat and turning the pages, becoming thoroughly absorbed by the story.
B009POHHRG|5.0|I'm not much on graphic novels, but I loved this one. It was recommended to me by my son, who is a bigger bat fan than I. The story and artwork are top notch.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|This game is really addicting!  It's a lot of fun.  I like music games.  And it was the free app today in perfect time for Christmas.<br />I have some experience with piano and on the best I could get on the beginning level was a B on a normal mode.  This is difficult to get a high grade.<br />But, you can still play it even if you don't get a good grade.  It still sounds like the song.  Or you can just listen to it.<br />There are different levels- I've been playing the beginning setting where it's slowed down.  You can also play apprentice where it's normal speed but it waits for you.  Or expert where the song doesn't stop.<br />This isn't a game to learn how to play piano.<br />It's like one of those arcade dance games where you have to push the note except you use your finger when the bar comes down.<br />Great game!
B002LC2DQ4|4.0|I like my Oympus camera, I really do, but one thing I DON'T like is the fact that it requires a proprietary memory card instead of a simple SD card like most other cameras.  Honestly, if I'd realized that, I'm not sure I would have gotten it.  My Canon point and shoot takes photos just as good - if not better - and uses a regular SD card.  But anyway, this is a review of them memory card, not the camera, right?  So, 'nuff kvetching and on with the review.<br /><br />I ordered this card from Amazon and it arrived quickly and well packaged as usual.  It comes in the typical cardboard/plastic flat retail  peg-hook package.  After cutting it open, I slipped the card in the camera and tried snapping a few pics.  The read/write speed was quick and although 2GB is not really an overwhelming amount of storage these days, it still allows you to snap quite a few images before having to download to clear space.  I'll probably order a couple more, just to have extras/backups.<br /><br />Unless I buy a new camera that uses standard SD cards instead.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|I appreciated this film so much. The editing, the footage, and the story was awesome. I like the MTV shows a lot but this film dealt deeper into some of the issues people deal with to make them act out.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|Moneyball dives into the change in the way baseball teams are built so much deeper than just \\"new statistics.\\" The depth of the story really helps you see the logic in what Billy Beane did in Oakland. Its not that the book is better than the move (even though it is), its just so much different and both are worth taking the tine to enjoy in their own way.
B001CISHU4|5.0|This album has some age on it by the time of this review, but it deserves credit for being one of the best overall albums metal albums and definitely the mark to beat in the viking metal sub-genre. Every song on this album is above average and you will rarely find yourself hitting skip to pass over a sub-par track.<br /><br />In short,<br />Twilight of the Thunder God - Great title track, awesome song, makes for great gym music. It is even historically accurate to Norse mythology. Not much else to say.<br />Free Will Sacrifice - Great start for a mediocre finish. \\"We will sacrifice them one by one, send them home to the gods\\" will join the ranks of Amon Amarth quotes to live by. Solid song that would have benefited from a better third verse.<br />Tattered Banners Bloody Flags - Possibly one of the best Amon Amarth songs ever and what should have been the title track. This song recounts the events leading up to Ragnarok in accurate detail, all the way up to the sound of the horn signaling the end.<br />The Hero -  A good song similar to Rune to My Memory. The account of a mercenary facing death for the benefit of strangers strikes a note.<br />Live for the Kill - Great use of Apocalyptica's talents in this song. It adds a lot of weight to the normal heavy beat when it suddenly interrupts eloquent cello playing<br />Embrace the Endless Ocean - Good song detailing the end of a warrior on the high seas. Not the most uplifting, but a great delivery none the less.<br /><br />In conclusion, I still listen to this CD on the day to work everyday if that says anything. It is a great list of songs to attest your love for metal or prepare you to concur the corporate world on a Tuesday in any case.
B00112C4EG|5.0|Very realistic!  My 3 year old grandson loves cows and he won't put them down.  The feel and quality of all the Schleich animals are great!  I would highly recommend them to anyone.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|I enjoyed this book more than any other Ken Follett.  Loved the mixture of history and fiction.  His characters give such an insight into how people coped in different countries during WW2.  Can't wait for the third book in the trilogy.  When are you coming to South Africa again - I saw you here after the first book?
B0068C9W44|5.0|Really good stuff. I love almost every song on this album. Excellent! My best buy of the year in music.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I was happy to buy this set which takes up a lot less room on my shelf that 6 old DVDs. The last time I watched Star Wars before getting this set was on VHS, so the picture is much improved. Being on blu-ray, it could pass for being filmed in this century.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|I watched this movie on TV as a kid and was dazzled by the special effects, the characters and the story.  The Blueray edition is spectacular---better than the original.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|MIB 3 is a little different from the others, it could have been better but I was not totally disappointed.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is awesome and challenging. it is the best game ever. so if your thinking of getting it, get it.
0316067598|5.0|Man, what can I say. This book is full of action and I purchased it at a very affordable price. In addition, it was in very nice condition.
B00A2IUHM6|4.0|I bought TED for my husband, but I found myself laughing out loud while we were watching it.  The movie is a tad too long and definitely not for kids. However, if you want to chill and chuckle, then this is the movie for you.
B0058YPL66|5.0|Love the modern twist to the century old fairy tales. Great entertainment!!!! Plan on ordering 2nd season as soon as available!!!
B004YXE438|5.0|These puzzles are beautiful. The levels of diffulty allow you to assemble the puzzles without stress.  I was happy to discover that the developer added more packages. However I wish there were more than 60 puzzles.
B006M6NV0M|5.0|The Expendables Extended Directors cut was awesome i brought this and expendables 2 and loved both movies.If you love the expendables 2 you will love the directors cut of the expendables 1much much better this time around.
B0055PMJMW|5.0|AUTHOR KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORKINGS OF THE LAPD AND ITS WORKINGS - SHOW THE DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE COIN - ALSO HIS BOOKS WITH FEMALE FBI AGENT AND THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HIS CHARACTERS ARE ACCEPTIONAL.... THE LINCOLN LAWYER SERIES IS ALSO GREAT - RECOMMEND EVERYONE SHOULD READ HIS BOOKS...
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|it is an awessome app but you might not want boys playing it.good for girls ages 3-13 from abby jkkj uuhg
B00008973A|5.0|I won't take away a star without good reason...  This item was sent directly to my niece as a gift.  She is unfortunately not in the habit of sending thank-you messages, so the fact that I haven't heard anything is a good sign (I hope).  I'm rating this at 5 stars on good faith and past experience...
B000003N7F|5.0|I was trying so hard to find this album without paying a fortune. Not only was this one affordable, but it was of such great quality. I will definitely be purchasing from this seller again!
B009A87ZQU|5.0|The Blu-ray looks and sounds fantastic, and the inclusion of DVD format as well for this price is a great deal.  The special features are great and I highly recommend this entry in the 'James Bond' franchise.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|the thing is it is very slow.it may be my device but its very slow.I cant even log into my other accounts.
0525953728|4.0|This book tells &#34;the story&#34; of how Bin Laden was killed.  I am impressed with the narration of the build up to the mission.  The Seals, Delta Force, the Green Berets, and all of our Special Forces deserve praise for their dedication and commitment to the cause of protecting America.
1400032717|4.0|I find the book convincing and psychologically reliable.  When I think about similar creations, \\"The Defence\\" comes into mind.  I also enjoyed the author's stylization.<br /><br />I don't think that Christopher is insensitive. He easily risks his life when he saves his rat; he feels sorrow when he finds the big dog.  He doesn't talk to his father, because he is mad at him, and rightfully so.  Lying to Christopher that his mom is dead was very cruel, and anyone would be mad.<br /><br />Christopher is right when he doesn't want to live with his father. The father either cannot or doesn't want to control his anger, he killed Wellington, he had a quarrel with Mrs Shears, and he knocks out his son (chapters 127 and 137).  From knocking out Christopher to, say, smashing his head against the wall, there is only one step.<br /><br />I liked the fact that the chapter numbers are really consecutive primes. I myself remember prime numbers up to 251.  But most of the other scientific facts are wrong.  For example:<br />- the Milky Way is 100,000 to 120,000 light-years in diameter, not \\"millions of light-years across\\".<br />- the sky is dark at night simply because the Universe is finite.<br />- if a star would move from us \\"nearly as fast as the speed of light\\", its light would reach us in exactly the same time as the light from a star which doesn't move from us at all.<br />- for the Sieve of Eratosthenes, you don't need to divide numbers by 4 or 6, only by prime numbers which you already found, thats its beauty.<br />- testing a 100-digit number for primality is not hard, and takes only a fraction of seconds (by Rabin-Miller primality test, for instance), not years, of computing time.  If CIA would pay $10,000 for each 100-digit prime number, it would be easy to become a millionaire.  However, factorization of a number which is a product of two big primes, is hard and may take many years of computer-time (or more), but it is another problem.<br />I could go on. Thats why I remove one point.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|It's Dean and Sam in their usual wisecracking and attention grabbing mission of saving the earth from the baddies.  I have watched every episode of Supernatural since the very beginning.  I am impressed with the full season price of only $10.  In short, if you like Supernatural then you will really enjoy this complete season with special features included.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|i loved this book it was awesome something besides a copy of everything else that is out there it was dreat
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Not bad at all!! IT is GREAT because because......... I don't know what to say because it is GREAT!!! I know one thing it is addicting! Also you should know it is just like temple run only more detailed I guess. I know I am a bad reviewer but HEY it is GREAT!!!!!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Very intense read and subject matter. I would call this a Mystery/Thriller. Kept me guessing til the last page. Wanted more of a prologue!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is the most fantastic book I have read in a while. It made me cry, and it made me smile. I absolutely loved it and didn't want it to end.
B004XVN1T4|5.0|One expects outstanding work from Ken Follett, and one is never disappointed. This is a thriller with  yet another twist, where the hero, little Nat Dickstein the Israeli wine merchant,  is deceptively weak and unimposing, but packs a surprisingly powerful punch. He is also not afraid to admit to inner fears and insecurities, thus making his triumph over many adversities all the more significant.<br />I will not go into the story line, others have done it better than I, but I will highly recommend this book to all geo-political thriller fans, as I always do any Ken Follett books to all thriller lovers.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's a little difficult but definitely a brain teaser. This game is really cool. My whole family is addicted to it!
1401937519|5.0|I bought this as a birthday gift. It gives descriptions of the non physical dimension that is hard to do... I really appreciate someone taking the time to do it!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I loved this book. It kept my attention. But having to write 12 more words to make this rating count is stupid what if I had only wanted to write one?
1401923127|5.0|Hope there are more books by Dr. Bruce Lipton . I have enjoyed this immensely. I can have hope in the human race based on his work.
1449410243|3.0|I don't know what I expected but this was not it.  It was just too, gee, I don't know? solid enough.  The title is catchy!  I think  I like I COULD PEE ON THIS more.  Yes, I do.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I've read almost all the Connelly books and have become a big fan of the author and Harry. The only problem I have with these books is not being able to put them down and staying up all night reading them.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I had this game on my ipod and I got it on the kindle and it bugs it dident bug on my ipod
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Waited until the DVD came out and then bought it.  It's a very good movie.  I love stuff with vikings in it. Kids think this movie is great too!
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|People should know that THIS IS WEBBER' VERSION, not Leroux' book.<br />For Andrew the story was ALWAYS about Christine and the Phantom.<br />Ben and Anna are the best Phantom and Christine I've seen for many years (Sierra and Ramin were great too but I prefer this couple).<br />Songs, sets, actors, love story....I loved everything.<br />Don't listen hard and annoying fans, they will hate without even see it.<br />Watch the movie and judge yourself.
B006M4RN3U|3.0|It's an OK album.  I bought it for the main song, Some Nights.  That song has really nice drum rhythm.  I don't really care for the other songs on the CD though.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I was not expecting this story line or this movie when I finally got it.  I am a MIB fan and this was the best of the series.  If you like MIB and want to see it in a different way, I highly recommend it.
B000002GJH|4.0|good sounding cd with some good music but would have liked it better if i had enjoyed more of the songs
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I play this with my dad, we compete on the levels a d see who gets it done faster. very fun!

0380730405|5.0|This novel is one of my lifetime favorites.  I havre read the book 3 times.  I purchased this copy because my local library did not have a copy any longer.
0064430227|5.0|A completely charming book.  The premise is very imaginative and, I expect, encourages imagination in children.  My 4-year-old grandson was rapt as a I read it to him.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|We enjoyed it. Anna Kendrick has an amazing voice. Could probably record. The movie itself was kind of corny, but we like to listen to good voices
B0070Y46UY|5.0|this is a great book! ever since Life of Pi were in the movie theaters i went to watch.u should see the movie.
1451638450|5.0|I've been a Bujold fan since the beginning. Damn how I've missed the madcap adventures of hers. Living inside Ivan's head for most of a book is grandly entertaining. The others involved in his adventure are probably less enthralled with his wit and competence than I am, but damn this was fun.<br /><br />This has pushed it's way into my top 5 fave favorite Bujold books.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I've been watching Walking Dead since it first aired and I've been hooked ever since! Season three has been nothing short of amazing and I look forward to see how the story progresses!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Incredible music. There are definitely some key songs that are missing and this is rather a limited selection. It won't take the place of the Complete Symphonic Recording or 10th or 25th Anniversary recordings, but it is definitely whetting my appetite for the movie. Anne Hathaway's I dreamed a dream is simply the best rendition of the song I have ever heard.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|I saw this in the theatre when it first came out and then rented it on Amazon for family night. I'm a fan of pretty much all of the comic book movies, but this was was extra good! Plenty of action, just enough humor and a good story line to hold my interest. Worth watching!
B0053O89XI|5.0|Awesome! I love this show and the fact that I can now  watch it any time I want.  My whole family enjoys it

B0058O84G0|5.0|I liked the way Follet actually cover all major historical events in details through the personal life of the characters in the book.<br />It is an amazing piece of literature.<br /><br />English is not my native language, however, I spent 3 weeks, 3 hours every night to complete readign it.<br />Nothing else was interesting for me in this time.<br />Highly recommended!

B0041KKYBA|5.0|My husband has purchased about 4 copies and has shared them with friends and relatives.  So I guess he thinks very highly of the DVD.
B0093STBP0|4.0|In French comedy \\"Comme un chef\\" Jean Reno plays Alexandre Lagarde, a veteran chef of a three-star restaurant, who is now in danger of losing a star in the next edition. The new owner of the restaurant, who thinks Alexandre's menus are too old-fashioned, wants to replace him with a younger chef specializing in \\"molecular food.\\" And Alexandre cannot come up with a new recipe for the next season.<br /><br />Help comes in an unexpected form when Alexandre encounters Jacky Bonnot (Michaël Youn), a wannabe cook whose ego gets in the way when he should be silent in the kitchen. Jacky is overjoyed to accept his hero Alexandre's offer and starts working for his restaurant, but is unable to confess that to his girlfriend Beatrice (Raphaelle Agogue), who is led to believe that Jacky has stopped chasing his dream of becoming a chef.<br /><br />This is a light-hearted comedy taking a few jabs at some movements in the industry. The film's story takes a turn for farce with Jean Reno disguised as a Japanese samurai (yes, you heard it right) in a jaw-droppingly silly sequence in a molecular restaurant. Spanish actor Santiago Segura also appears as an eccentric molecular food specialist.<br /><br />But the driving force of the uneven but delightful comedy (of which story reminds us of Pixar's \\"Ratatouille\\") is the portrait of characters played by Jean Reno and Michaël Youn, and their credible master-apprentice relationship. Unlike Linguini, a \\"garbage boy\\" Remy the gourmet mouse teams up with, Reno's Alexandre is already a TV celebrity who has his own TV show. Youn's Jacky, discontent with the way his favorite dish is cooked, offers some \\"advice\\" to his master.<br /><br />The result is predictable, and so is the film's storyline itself. And it works, thanks to the great chemistry between the stars. \\"Comme un chef\\" is a comedy as light as soufflé, and is funny and entertaining.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I decided to give this Novella a try since I enjoy Sanderson's other works and it was only $5.  I expected it to be good and it exceeded expectations.
B0091LRZZW|5.0|This was given as a gift to my sister for Christmas.  She saw the show on PBS and just  loved it.  She didn't know they have the DVD.  She sent me the CD which was very well done.  She really was wishing they had the DVD because she really loved the way it was presented showing him making the album.  She will be please when she gets this. Paul remade some old songs and added one he wrote.  They are beatifully done.  If you are a fan of Paul McCartney you will really enjoy this.

B009HELT3C|4.0|*** This review is not about the movie itself but about the method for downloading from Amazon.  The movie was great which is why I gave 4 stars! ***<br /><br />Does anyone else have a problem buying/downloading HD movies from a computer-to-TiVo versus buying/downloading directly from TiVo?<br /><br />I have purchased/downloaded numerous SD movies and HD TV shows - and have always been able to \\"DOWNLOAD to -DEVICES\\" from the available menu option.  However the last two times I bought HD movies, I did not get that menu option - I simply got the WATCH NOW option.  The canned response from Amazon Customer Service was, basically, do it from your TiVo or \\"open the Your Video Library on your TiVo\\" and download the video from there.  There is no such setting on the TiVo Premier.  But Customer Service was able to push the purchased HD movie to my TiVo for me - so it must be technically possible.<br /><br />Unless I'm missing something, my original complaint stands:  Amazon needs to add some OBVIOUS verbiage BEFORE a customer orders an HD movie that indicates they will NOT be able to download the movie from their computer.  Had I not contacted Customer Service, I would have been stiffed $3.99 and not been able to enjoy the movie.  Perhaps Amazon should add the ability to download HD movies like any other SD or HD show content to TiVo, or have TiVo add a direct link to \\"Your VIdeo Library\\" from the TiVo box.  Either would work to simplify this process.<br /><br />But has anyone else experienced this?  And am I missing some setting in TiVo or Amazon that would solve this?
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best story line . Best &#34;cliff hangers&#34;.More action. Tense , evocative.<br />Can't wait till the rest of the season three.....
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|My least favorite of all the Batman movies.  I like Bale, Oldman, Hathaway but this suffered from uneven plot, awful direction, poor character development and and gratuitous violence.

B00881VLCE|5.0|I've enjoyed this so far. The music is a bit redundant and annoying after a while. I wish each puzzle had a different song. That would help.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I like this game A LOT!!! The Graphics were awesome. Story was really good. Puzzles & HO games were cool... I really like the skip & hint buttons too. I'm NO expert, so I don't play on expert mode. I just get too impatient. This game kept me entertained for a long while.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|My girls even thought this was weird. We had to uninstall this app. I don't recommend this one at all.

1401937519|4.0|Bit drawn out but a good book.  The actual experience written about was quite short but very encouraging to fearful people.
B000FCKRDI|5.0|What can I say about this stellar book and overall series that hasn't already been covered quite eloquently by fellow fans? (Consider that a rhetorical question, because the answer is clearly \\"not much at all\\"!) Kleypas' Wallflowers and Hathaway series managed to single-handedly convert me from someone utterly indifferent to historical romances to an unabashed, lifelong addict. This third entry in the Wallflower series may be the very most resonant, memorable and eminently re-readable of the series. (I know, I know; 're-readable' isn't a legitimate word, but it should be!)<br /><br />What I Loved:<br /><br />1. As someone who places a tremendous value on writing style, Kleypas' never ceases to delight me. It's breezy and effortless, yet infused with a sneaky amount of depth and insight. Her books are intensely passionate and emotionally powerful without veering into the cringe-inducingly overwrought---an understandably difficult feat for many romance authors. Her prose is evocative and lush, but I'm especially enamored with her dialogue---it's razor sharp, endlessly quotable and gives my Kindle's \\"highlight\\" button quite a workout. She knows how to use dialogue to effectively illuminate her characters and move along the story, masterfully adhering to that \\"show, don't tell!\\" advice preached by writing instructors since the beginning of time.<br /><br />2. Kleypas' characters are so phenomenally vivid, compelling and distinctive that you'll find yourself thinking of them long after you've turned that final page. (Er, maybe that's just me...?!) The Devil in Winter's Evie Jenner is lovable and admirable, yet a distinctive and delightful departure from the generically perfect heroines we find in far too many other novels. Anyone who's suffered from a speech impediment or just a general shyness and social awkwardness might find themselves connecting particularly well with this heroine. Sebastian, meanwhile, is a deliciously, amusingly awful cad with a not-so-secret heart of gold. I was initially skeptical as to whether I could buy the previously villainous Sebastian as our leading man, but I needn't have worried. His transformation from the seemingly heartless and vain yet secretly self-doubting villain to a loving, bona fide hero is earned and immensely satisfying.<br /><br />3. As powerful and swoon-worthy as the central romance is, Kleypas knows that fully realized characters and storylines also allow for a focus on friendships and family relationships. I've come to cherish the Wallflowers' friendships as deeply as the series' romances. I also welcome the dashes of danger and suspense; while we all know the hero and heroine will eventually live happily ever after, this book never lacks for tension and excitement.<br /><br />4. These books are a perfect, seamless blend of mood-boosting wit and deep, heart-clenching poignancy. This is a balance that many authors strive for, but few achieve with this degree of success.<br /><br />What I Didn't Love:<br /><br />This is more about my personal preference than an objective criticism of the book or series, but as someone who tends to hail from the \\"less is more\\" school of thought on sex scenes, I feel like Kleypas' are a bit too frequent, lengthy and repetitive. I actually feel like their sizzle and passion might resonate with me more if there were fewer of them. Potential readers should rest assured, though, that the sex scenes stem from the rich story and characterizations rather than overshadowing them. And they sure don't lack for steaminess! [/understatement]<br /><br />I've read that Kleypas is focusing solely on contemporaries from now on, but I'm merrily swimming in denial and hoping that she returns to the historicals for which she has such a unique gift. My ever thinning wallet has forced me to buy far fewer books than I used to, but the Wallflowers and Hathaway books are among the most worthwhile purchases I've made. They're just as sublimely pleasurable and satisfying with subsequent readings---and, believe me, I've already tested that theory. :)ubsequent readings---and, believe me, I've already tested that theory. :)
B0086213XW|3.0|I enjoyed this movie. I'm not much of a critic but I thought it has an interesting conclusion even though the dilemma is not new.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|This episode was well thought out. It blended one of our favorite superheros with his human side and  did marvelous job of making us  guys become him and all the girls wanted to take care of the invalid billionaire bachelor. It was interesting how from the beginning of the show I wanted Bruce to be in love with with the vixen. The writers managed to keep that desire throughout the script even though the obvious better choice was the gorgeous rich girl. And then POW! The ending hits you in the gut as she drives her dagger deep into his side like my ex-girlfriend did to me and yours has done to you. We want to run to the vixens side beg forgiveness and hand in permanent lust till, ha! Let it never end.<br /><br />A must own movie, Will watch over and over. I even cried at one point!!
B000YT3KEA|5.0|This is a great starter book for pre-school age children who are too young to follow the full version of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe--or who might find the story too intense.  The illustrations are beautiful!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|This movie surprised me on how it seamlessly fit in with the alien series at the end. I bought the alien anthology just to watch them again.

1423140605|5.0|Once again, Riordan caught my full attention with a magnificent narrative style that leaves you wanting more. The way Jason, Percy, Anabeth, Piper, Frank, Leo and Hazel relate one to another and how their powers continue yo amaze me, wraps me even more in the story. It's going to be tough waiting for the following months until I can catch Anabeth and Percy in their search for the Doors of Death in the next book. Hurry up Rick!!!! October is so far away!!!
0143119680|5.0|Could not put it down. I have now read this book at least 12 times. I know its silly, but when I can't find a good book to read, I pick it up or book 2 and start reading it again. I can't wait for Book 3 to come out.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|The much anticipated film version of the musical LES MISERABLES presents a challange to the label getting the rights to release a CD \\"recorded directly from the soundtrack\\" (as they used to claim on early film soundtrack album covers. Laziness led to people calling them \\"soundtracks\\" and stupidity allowed that to grow to the point where the term is often (wrongly) applied to stage cast recordings.)<br /><br />The truth is that long before WICKED came along, LES MIZ has become the lifeblood of a group of obsessed fan-girls who saw the show multiple times, and memorized every recorded version to a point where they could name the particular recording within 3 bars if they had to. They invaded internet Broadway chat sites with endless and inane posts about who was the best Marius or Cossette and speculating years in advance who would take on these roles in the eventual film adaptation. Of course, nothing  that was announced was pleasing to these kids and they began deriding the film almost as soon as it went in front of the cameras.<br /><br />Going back a bit, when LES MISERABLES opened in London in 1985, the original London cast made an album, issued by First Night Records, of the key songs...not the entire show (which is through-sung, as in an opera.)  The London cast album was issued as a 2 LP set and later a 2 Cd edition which added some additional material left off the LP.  The album became a best-seller and the show was  sell-out smash hit in London. Plans were quickly made to bring the musical to Broadway and it was hoped the Broadway company would make a new cast album of the entire show. Geffen records released the Broadway cast album - again a 2 LP or CD set with essentially the same segments as heard on the London cast recording (but without a few sections that had been dropped from the show such as little Gavroche's charming introductory number \\"Little People.\\")<br /><br />As the show began opening in theatres all over the world, other cast albums were madein different languages, but none were truly complete until First Night released a 3 CD set billed as \\"The Complete Symphonic recording\\" with the cast selected from various international companies, backed by a symphony sized orchestra far larger than would ever be heard in a theatre. Concerts to celebrate the show's 10th and 25th anniversary also yielded full-length recordings, although the concerts did abridge some segments.<br /><br />Now comes the movie version, and once again the record company (Polydor) has decided that a single CD of highlights will suffice. The Cd runs 65 minutes 31 seconds (The movie runs 157 minutes as per IMDB.) Obviously much of opera's recitative is missing and what we have here are just some of the key songs sounding like..well, audio clips taken from a film print. Modern technology has allowed for recordings taken from the films to be remixed for home listening, avoiding that boxy Hollywood soundstage sound quality that afflicts many of the classic M-g-M and Warner Bros. soundtrack albums, but even so dialogue always sounds like it is being piped in from the next room.<br /><br />It is the performances that everyone will be interested in. The voices are full of character if not always the musical ability an opera requires. One would never think of casting Russell Crowe as Don Jose in Bizet's CARMEN, yet here he has been asked to sing a demanding score of similar operatic dimensions. He manages well enough but it does make you wonder if Hollywood has been unfairly slighted  for its long-standing process of dubbing weak (or non-singing) performers with stronger voices.<br /><br />The song \\"Bring Him Home\\" is still owned by Colm Wilkinson (who introduced it in the original London production) and Patti Lupone's original recording of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" is as definitive as we'll ever likely get.  These songs are on the new Cd in completely acceptable interpretations, as are other memorable moments: \\"Master of the House\\", \\"On My Own\\" and \\"One Day More.\\"  Hugh Jackman seems a bit forced (and a more than a bit wobbly) in segments where he has to use his head voice, but the dramatic intention comes through pure and strong.<br /><br />As to what is not included, fans can hope that eventually a 2 CD set will be issued (There has been no word from Universal Music on plans for such a set) or they will be forced to bootleg MP3 files off the eventual DVD release. For now, this CD serves as a souvenir of what promises to be one of the year's biggest films.

B007V65R54|5.0|What is the nature of our reality and what is most likely to happen next?  If you like thinking about the practicalities of the present and predicting the future, you may enjoy this book as much as I am so far (about half-way through on Kindle). The math is not fear-inducing.  It is a light read, akin to Freakonomics, teasing apart the human elements of how we feel about things as we add up the numbers and evaluate the huge quantities of information now available.  Political pundits, poker, baseball, weather... How are we getting in our own way? What is useful?  What is information and what is wisdom?  It's one of those books that makes me happy when I realize, &#34;Woohoo!  I get a chance to ready now!&#34;
B006LSZECO|5.0|If I had any writing talent, I would aspire to be Gillian Flynn.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND all of her books.
0547884591|4.0|I purchased this book out of interest in the meta-learning process that the author undertook to write the book.  I got much more than I expected, including some great tips on how to create fantastic meals in my kitchen at home.  I found myself reading it from front to back and then jumping around within to re-read specific interesting bits.  He covers more ground in this book than any \\"cook book\\" I have ever seen, and while some may see that as a weakness, I enjoyed it entirely.

B00A77II0U|4.0|Stray Souls is an adventure/hidden object game. It opens with a couple snuggling on the couch. A mystery package is delivered and suddenly the main character's husband vanishes into thin air.<br /><br />LIKES:<br />1. The story was well thought out and intriguing. What happened to Sam? Why do you have to return to his childhood home? (And what is with the creepy clown?!?)<br />2. The goals in each location were understandable. Besides HO scenes, player must locate needed items to solve puzzles and unlock new locations.<br />3. The graphics were well done.<br />4. The hints were plentiful.<br /><br />DISLIKES:<br />1. Was expecting a longer game. Alawar games are usually super long. While there is a lot to do and many places to explore this $2.99 game was not as long as the ones that cost $0.99.<br />2. When replaying the game hidden objects are located in the exact same spots. (This wouldn't be an issue if the game was longer. You wouldn't remember where everything was placed in each HO scene.)<br /><br />Overall this was money well spent. I am hoping for a sequel - weird doll included.

0345509617|5.0|Amazing book the behind the scenes photos are worth the purchase I have the making of Star Wars and this book is equally as good. Highly recommended! Can't wait for the making of Return of the Jedi. Just an amazing job by the author of putting together a great read!
B003L77G06|1.0|I hate this show - SORRY . It for doing nothing when there is nothing better to do . My daughter made me purchase this for her friend .
0385737955|4.0|It's been a while since I've been able to find a series that I can get into.  Obviously what began with Harry Potter is now a crazed search for the next enthralling series...and while not as well written as HP or as character driven as The Hunger Games, The Maze Runner is a very good read!  It took a good 30-70 pages to get fully into the story, but at about page 82-85, I decided I couldn't put it down.  In the matter of about a half day, I was finished reading the first book and am heading to the book store tonight to buy the second one.  If you're looking for another series to get into and have enough interest to not want to put it down, go ahead and dive in!  I think you'll find it interesting and a quick read, after you get over the \\"young language\\".
B009MFKO3M|5.0|The title of this review says it all. It is definitely a must-listen for all fans of psychedelic rock. A solid second album.
0486268659|4.0|It was a Great gift for my Co-workers. I placed it in x-mas bags with cookies & candy canes. Everyone loved it!
B000AMJC2K|5.0|I wanted to do a project where I converted a desktop computer into a \\"portable\\" unit. Small two story coffee table, 4 casters, & one of these arms and now I have a high power computer that can sit beside any of my chairs / couch. No more heavy (or hot) laptops.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|My favorite Christmas oriented comedy, period.<br />Some folks have a Christmas tradition of food. I have a tradition of watching this.
B001C08RHA|4.0|Wasn't sure if I would like this movie but Amazon had it on sale for under $2.00 so I figured I would give it a shot.  Amazon also included as a bonus a digital version of the movie so I really had nothing to lose.  I figured I would watch the digital version and if I didn't like it I could give the dvd as a gift.  I watched the movie last night and I was entertained and surprised.  Needles to say I will be keeping the hard copy.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|This music is perfect.  I too have always enjoyed music for my intimate moments.  Loved it.  Thank you so much. Denise
B00466HM28|5.0|Great product! Incredibly easy to set up. I had it fully functioning just a few minutes after taking it out of the box.
B006MVJ2L4|4.0|Not bad,,If you are a fan of Adam,,,you will love this CD<br /><br />I am suprised he didn't get more hits off of this cd,<br /><br />Jake
B000SEGUDE|2.0|I have never read a book that contained so many characters I just don't care about.  Really hyped up for the movie.  Haven't seen the movie yet and after this book I'm waiting for cable but it may be one of those rare times that its better then the book.
B008N1V11U|1.0|I paid 2 times It will not install do not get save ur money beget off getting for iphone please read
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|works just like the real one just don't get the money but good game to play and don'tcost you anything and can play for hours
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is one of the best series ever made for television.  I'm in love with all the characters, with their little idiosyncrasies and interpersonal relationships.  It's like a book you can't bear to put down!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It was such a good book. Why did it have to end so quickly? I can't wait for the next one now.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|I find that these triggers truly enhance my gaming experience and I recommend them for every gamer, for every genre. Do yourself a favor and get these.
B007MAETA8|2.0|This is John Mayer doing country -- and it just doesn't work.  I was disappointed, as I love all of John Mayer's other work.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I've enjoyed manipulating the pictures; then I create greeting cards. The application is easy to use.  Just upload and start creating!
B005EVVESM|5.0|Pleasantly surprised to find so many good songs on this. Only about two I didn't care for.  I would recommend.
B005CRQ2XA|1.0|I recently purchased a Kindle Touch for my daughter for Christmas and was going to purchase all the Diary of Wimpy Kid books (Her Favorite series) on only to discover I can't.  Huge disappointment. Amazon need to fix ASAP. Why would Amazon only make certain books available on certain Kindles?
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Wonderful. Historical drama with great acting, leaving you at the edge of your seat. Well worth waiting for. It is the best historical drama ever.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Bought this because i love zombies and i have been reading the graphic novels even before the TV series came out.<br /><br />The first part of the season takes too long to take off, because of the Sophia problem. But then it gets better.<br />The second season was just a set up for all the amazing things that are happening on season 3 ... but if you love the story and the characters this is a must buy.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Played on Kindle Fire with no problems. Could zoom in on most screens. Several different types of puzzles with varying degrees of difficulty, including some I've never seen before (finding hidden objects in the dark with only a 'flashlight'). Played once with the dialog and once without. Got this as a Faotd but worth paying for.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|AMAZING FANTASTIC SERIES THE ENDING WAS GREAT SAD BUT GREAT! I could read it over and over. Cannot wait for the movie.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I found the book very insightful.  It seemed to take the politics out and talk about the men.  A great look at our history as a nation.  I would recommend it to everyone.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I thought this was a great read. It was a fast read for me but I like Riordans writing style. I've also finished the 2nd book in the series and I'm currently on the 3rd.
B0060D123K|5.0|Jim Henson is pretty much the greatest, and this timeless classic is just as good as I remember it being. Definitely something great for the whole family. Bonus: Michael Caine is in it, and he is a fabulous actor. However, ten bucks is a little pricey for a digital version of an older movie.
B0059XTU1S|1.0|I am a long time, huge fan, of The Hobbit and LOTR books.  I was really looking forward to this movie, as I thought the LOTR movies were very well done, particulary The Fellowship of the Ring, but this movie was very dissappointing.  First of all, does The Hobbit really need to be made into 3 movies?  Really?  There were too many \\"filler\\" side line stories going on in this movie, which in my opinion, took away from the main story line.  Also, the fight scenes weren't very good (and there are alot of them), I found myself getting bored when the fight sequences came up.  The fighting was not exciting, or distinctive, rather it was repetitive and kind of all blurred together in the end.  There was too much fighting I think, and not enough story, if that makes sense.  They did change some things about the story too, and I didn't really care for the changes.  The gollum scenes and the eagles were cool though.  There needed to be more Bilbo time too, as I didn't feel like his character had a strong presence in the movie, and he is the main character - the dwarves have a stronger presence than Bilbo.  The movie dragged on over all, felt slow, I really think this should have been made into a single flick, and should have stayed closer to the books story line.  In summary, to me, this movie missed the target, and it does not succeed in capturing the heart of the story of The Hobbit.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I am unfortunately old enough to remember all the fuss of the original Alien coming out in 1979. Like a lot of people I was most intrigued by the origins of the space jockey so when I heard about Proeteus I couldn't wait.<br /> This film was obviously made with an eye to future sequels as there are so many unanswered questions and especially the ending, they may as well have put &#34; to be continued&#34; on the screen. But generally is a cut above the dross that Hollywood puts out.<br /> I give this only four stars as it does not include the making of documentary, which I found out after I bought it and after fruitlessly searching thru the menus, only appears on the 4disc package. Oh well guess I should have checked a bit more.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Super great game!! I love the sounds and graphics!! My 5 year old son loves this game too. Best Angry Birds yet !!
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Movie was too long and had tedious storyline and tended to drag in the the middle for about 30 minutes. Some of the characters accents into English very hard to discern what they were saying.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|I really like this game.  Thinking skills required but not so difficult that it is frustrating.  Like angry birds or bad piggies you can beat it or try for a three star win for an extra challenge.  Good clean fun.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|the game fits fine on my screen and I luv it!  I usually don't like games but I liv this game! :)
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|The movie was full of action and suspense. Very entertaining to watch and it did remind me of the old Total Recall!  Lots of good actors in this movie also.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|Dickens was a social force and a writer who had the ability to write a morality play and still delight with language to touch the heart and mind.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I pick four case cause its a good book but ant really I book I would read and read again. And then after I read this book I sat down and thought about the book a lot! So and also after I read it I would really would that book again and like it cause I mean don't get me wrong I like this book but you know I thank it really, want for me!!!!!! But it still was a very good book. And learn a bunch of stuff that I Didn't even know that I know now! And that is good cause now I can go to school and tell then some stuff too! Am kidey glad that I read this book cause it will make u smarter.............. but than. Is my summer
B009FXIICK|5.0|This is my new favorite matching game. It seems hard at first, but then your vision develops and it is like Tetris where you get in the &quot;zone&quot; and see the next three matches and the serotonin starts to flow.... funny little cartoons after the game and I love the happy music!
B009O2XY12|3.0|If the game is free, why do have to pay for refill? Do have to buy gems., I am confused.
B0085MNZ66|5.0|I like it.  DREAM-E had a cool interface.  You can customize the sounds and volume.  Helps me get to sleep in noisy locales.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Very unusual, but intriguing, concepts.  Not as spellbinding as all his earlier books.  Nevertheless, am looking forward to any new works.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I enjoyed playing this game with its mix of puzzles, games, and adventure story line. There is a pay wall (in game purchase) about halfway through the game, so to finish the game is not free.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Picked this up as a distraction, played for a while and then it asked me to buy more coins to continue playing....NOT
B009KHBDUU|3.0|Johnny Depp never lacks for character; there are several other solid performances, and much visual and storytelling cleverness.  There's just not quite enough meat in the story to be worthy of those other aspects in my opinion.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was absolutely the best of Colleen's work to date.  It was so well written and so involved.  It is definitely a must read.
0345534379|4.0|Really a fun volume for the kids, but it's so heavily abridged from the Guinness Books of a decade or so back that it's not great reference in any comprehensive sense.  Still, worth the money.
1451638450|4.0|Very interesting story that finally showed some of Ivan's real intelligence and character. Also some interesting in-laws. IMPSEC  finally gets a new headquarters
B0077ATSSQ|4.0|Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors & again, did a wonderful job recounting a tender story about our nation's 9/11 tragedy.
B006MW3V6U|3.0|I like this period piece and it seems better than the normal offerings for this type of show.<br />It is well acted and I love the history of the period/
B0059XTUVI|4.0|I bought this for my Mother, the Iron Lady of our family. I'm sure she'll enjoy the historical references & Streep's acting.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This has been one of my favorite movies since I was 8, and now my 8 yr old loves it too. I didn't quite remember all the colorful language from being a child, but I still love it.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This series is entertaining and different from other shows out there. It's a bit gory at times, but overall quite fun to watch.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Very descriptive and well written. A bit  gruesome, can,t imagine the movie for children, but I found the book interesting.  Leaves you wondering if any of his stories are due to hallucinating?
B004GJDQT8|4.0|My wife and I will frequently use this app for browsing along with amazon &#34;Price Check&#34; and we love it. the only issue that we are having is that on our ASUS Transformer tablet the app fails to install since it is being recognized as a PC and not an android based appliance. I also have the New Egg app installed on everything, including the ASUS tablet, and it works great; hence I know that it is not a matter that it cannot be done.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|I enjoyed the action and the storyline.  I thought the actors did a great job.  I hope with the open ending it means they'll make more.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This app is great. remember your first time of drawing your friends or family? this is that simple yet still fun. You draw your stick and start your story. creative use of other stick objects only adds to overall theme. draw clouds that rain, fire that burns obSTICKals out of your, keys unlock fences. This app is great for 5yr and up. Fun fun total fun.
B009E3EYMY|5.0|Best in concert ever.  I have other DVD of Led live and this is the best one. 5 stars or 6.....
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|I rarely review movies.<br /><br />I figure we should all see for ourselves.<br /><br />I just HAD to write about this one though.<br /><br />I love the actors but absolutely HATE this abomination.<br /><br />How can so many good actors make such a crap film?<br /><br />This is just sad.  So sad.  It just laid there like the proverbial milk dud in a punch bowl.<br /><br />Gag.  YMMV.  Member FDIC. Void where prohibited by law.
B009GE9Y44|2.0|Weak story (even for Resident Evil standards) and the animation was not up to current standards. Only bother with this if you are a huge RE fan and really, really need a new fix.
0307961443|5.0|I loved this book!  I had to read it after watching the video.  There is so much to learn from the book that is not made quite clear in the video.  Although, the video was amazing!  A very in-depth book that makes you think.  Without giving away the ending, I felt a certain closeness to the two main characters.
B00A0SMTXS|5.0|I was very skeptical as to why they would remake an Arnold movie that was decent, but not stellar. This is one case where the remake was far superior to the original. Much more true to the original story idea, and this is a movie that had to be effects driven, as both versions were, but the advances in the last 20 years really allowed this movie to shine.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Thank you G5, for another great game. I wish it was a little longer but we'll worth the price. Can't wait for the sequel!!
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|Stallone, Statham, Li, Arnold, Bruce....and CHUCK NORRIS? I'm glad I bought the first movie in this 'franchise', but even happier that I only rented this one.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have an i-phone and this app on my kindle fire looks just like the one on my iphone and functions exactly the same.
B009VB7QQA|1.0|ABE LINCOLN....VAMPIRES...DO I NEED TO SAY MORE? This movie had better production values than my 'worst movie of all time', but was juat as bad...(Leprechan #3)
B009CGYO0K|5.0|Do you like gritty/dark humor? Do you own a cat? Buy this book and laugh--laugh full heartily.  Don't do it on a full bladder though you might tinkle.  If you get this fire kindle it looks great on it but the print is a wee too small so if you have weak eyes you might want to get the print version
1419705849|5.0|I bought this book for a friend. It is  in new condition. No flaws what so ever and for a fraction of the price I pay in bookstores. Great value
B001QVFDA4|5.0|An occasionally gritty flick about the London underground with a moment of emotional clarity provided by the interaction between heterosexual and homosexual friends (Butler and Hardy) - what a film! &#34;If I could be half the human that Bob is at the price of being a 'puff' - I'd think about it...not for too long, but I'd have to pause.&#34;  I loved this film so much after the rental I chose to buy it. RocknRolla....consider yourself endorsed.
B0032O6S4I|4.0|My daughter loves playmobil!  This set will have hours of fun for her!  The only down side to this set it that there is no way for it to &#34;stay together&#34; anytime you move it - it is a complete put back together project.  It isn't one of the harder sets to put together and it is fun to make the pieces work in different ways - my daughter doesn't seem to mind -so I guess I shouldn't either.  fun set!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I love this product and I highly recommend this read for EVERYONE....especially liberals. It's a very revealing look at our nations special forces and how professional they are!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy to use. Quick loading, great for beginners. Great for times when you have a just a few minutes to play.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|I can't believe this movie was made...it was horrible!!!!...this will be the last  resident evil movie that I watch..<br />.the plot didn't make any sense
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I have read all of Tom Clancy's books and this is by far the best.  I have been slowing down my reading so I can savior each page.  If only half of the technology presented in the book is plausible the premise is very scary.  Must buy for Clancy fans!
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Great movie. The ending reviels that its not over. Im looking forward to the next Borne and maybe both Jeremy and Matt will be in it!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really enjoy this game but I do not like the adds that keep popping up. I know I got this for free and nothing is really free but really?
1400049628|5.0|An awesome book that is very detailed. The book makes it feel like zombies already exist and prepares you if they did. Very amusing to read and very well written. I would recommend this and any Max Brooks book.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Sustained excellence is a rare thing. NCIS has it. Each year has something and someone new to stir the pot. You still care about each of the characters that you have come to know and love. I hope their up for several more years.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|a amazing game very well though out with a great game play mechanic.  Well deserving of its rating and should be a five star game. I love order and chaos...  Entaro tassadar
B000I0QL82|5.0|The transfer is a little better than my older double disc set of Holiday Inn/Going My Way, but the extras add a lot. The interview with Fred Astaire's dad is truly interesting.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|Kept me entertained. This is a good movie it you really don't want to have to think and rant a couple laughs
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Many movies are predictable and that's okay.  Not every story you hear must have a surprise ending.  I guess I just expect better from Meryl Streep.
B0058VW36U|5.0|So i started to play it and lost track of where i was didn't realize i had an audience of 2 a 9 yr old and a 3 yr old i end it up giving up the Kindle at level 9 jajaja enjoy Kidos.<br />Cut the rope i think Cut mommy off
B009GEAPYW|4.0|VERY GOOD STORY LINE REPRISING ONE OF THE MOST MEMORABLE BATMAN SERIES EVER.<br /><br />My only nerd grip is the cgi is really corny
B009WO7NQO|5.0|who doesn't love hearing these birds fly I can't get this away from my kids they wont let me play but i hear them and i can't stop laughing it sounds like the movie i'll eventually play it late at night I think but yeah my child 9 loves it so it was worth the download.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app works better than any other Solitaire app I've used. Animation is great. Ease of moving cards around is great.
B005HSL626|3.0|Yeah I downloaded the free app but only because I have it on all my other devices. X-box, phone and my daughters Nabi it's addictive and fun we might get it but I think i might forget it's a great game for kids to have while there waiting for an appointment.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|i loved this game. great story telling clear ans easy yo maneuver.  hidden objects although not that easy to find ..it wasn't t that hard.  I am glad I brought the game.  the pirate games are great..looking forward to<br /> pirate adventures 3.
B004DK49DW|1.0|no me ha llegado mi pedido aún Tengo dos pedidos realizados con fecha de entrega del 12 y 18 de diciembre respectivamente Quiero saber dónde están mis solicitudes
B004UID2LC|5.0|I think this app is great because it give no problems no bugs  and its better than downloading on your computer
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I thought alot about whether to give this three stars or four.  I finally decided to give it four because despite the over long details with names and characters, I still find myself drawn to the book and enjoying it very much.  What keeps me reading it is I care about the characters and want to know what eventually happens with them.  They are colourful and entertaining, just don't take the book too seriously.  I do, however, find some of the situations too violent and have to skim through them.  All in all, though, I am really enjoying it.
B009A9BFBK|5.0|The length of both sides is perfect and the quality of the vinyl is wonderful. The songs themselves are very memorable.
0525952926|5.0|Winter of the World: This book was compelling reading and the author did a masterfull job of containing the story of the Fall of Giants.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|If you enjoyed the show and could watch it over and over, this is the series for you.<br />I gave as a gift to brother-in-law and he has all the previous seasons.<br />he is enjoying the series.
B0053O89IS|5.0|We love wayching bones and had missed the 7th season it was great, we cant wait for seson 8 to come out
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|As I began reading, I never thought the book would take the reader where it did. What came first, the photos or the text?
B0076DELIG|4.0|Another great book in mthe harry Bosch series. I can't wait until the next one comes out. Write faster Michael Connelly!
B009B8YZIK|5.0|Really thought would be low budget knockoff.  No way.  Make a Halo 5.  Spartan 117 rules! Great movie to tart
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|We rented this because we love Tommy lee and Meryl. The movie was boring and had no real point other than they hadn't had sex for several years. There was never a reason given only hinted at. I am sorry we wasted our money renting this.
B009PEPML4|5.0|This is a Godspeed album you can really rock out to. I think the key is that the themes are simpler and transition very smoothly; at times it sounds like the product of a jam session, maybe it is though I picture these folks as more the meticulous composer types. This is officially the record to get people started on Godspeed if they haven't heard it yet or roll their eyes at so-called pretentious instrumental music.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love it. I wish the computer version had some of the same filters.<br />Couldnt be happier I downloaded this to my Kindle.
B009GYSQV6|5.0|This is the darkest and most fem-angry CC record yet. It... it shouldn't turn me on but it does. The bridge on &#34;Plague&#34; is just too cool, like pumping steam geysers before going back into the theme full bore, and the last track is completely touching even though it could have so easily been cheesy synth ballad trash. With 3 splendid albums under their belt I officially consider CC a great band.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|I love the original Total Recall, but this one is worth renting. I like the more hi tech modern look to this story. I missed Arnold S. however Colin was very cool and more believable as a spy in this version of the movie. **Spoiler Alert** I was disappointed to see this version of the movie took out the reference to the planet Mars entirely and substituted it with biochemical warfare on Earth (???). The lack of low oxygen Mars mutants changes the feel of the entire story. I know the newer version of Total Recall wants to be different, but I missed the traitor Benny ( with his \\"five kids to feed\\"), the mutant's hero resistance leader, Kuato & the alien technology that can terraform a planet and produce oxygen) which leaves a lot to be desired in Colin's movie. There are a lot of action and fight scenes to keep you entertained. I like the robot Federal Police however, not sure why the robot cops seem off line all the time. There seemed to be a larger story behind these robots and they reminded me too much of IRobot (I was waiting for VIKI to come in and take control of the invasion to the colony).<br />All in all, please rent this movie. There is not as much cursing and blood like the original.
B0064W67IM|5.0|These stories are like awesome contemporary myths, plus one completely chilling horror story. Gaiman somehow creates real tension and drama even though it takes place in a world where pretty much anything can happen. Neat!
B0011TNVLY|5.0|Great movie for my two year old five year old and me! We all loved it n we got it on instant video so we can watch right away to get us in the spirit of the holidays
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Loved this book. Kept my interest and wasn't sure how it was going to end up, which seems to be unusual.  A lot of the books I've read recently are very predictable.  Good value.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|like the game but can be addictive and I can use up coins up fast<br />but other than that good game
B003SI84D6|5.0|TOMBSTONE  IS AN EXCELLENT MOVIE AND COMPLETE  ENTERTAINMENT,WELL MADE.OUTSTANDING EFFECTS WITH GREAT ACTORS. CURT RUSSELL IS ABSOLUTELY WELL SUITED FOR THE PART.
B009FZFONO|5.0|For a long time now I've been by large a zombie fan when it comes to horror movies.  Although there are several different types of zombies portrayed in a wide range of different movies, I love the idea of being continueously stalked by creatures that aren't of the alpha design.  Zombies are usually portrayed as slow albeit dumb individuals whose wants and needs are simply to devour your flesh.  While you may be able to escape fairly easily, you can never let your guard down for a moment.<br />  You may say i'm bias since I love the zombie franchise, but this title brings so much more to the genre.  Usually zombie flicks pay more attention to the blood and gore then the people who are trying to survive.  This is where &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; really shines!  They have incorporated such a diverse character build that every episode I'm left talking about how each person in the show has changed the way they think, act, their allegience and thier moods depicted.  My girlfriend isn't a zombie fan, but absolutely loves this show.  After each episode we end up talking for a half an hour just about the characters that make this series so unique.  Never have i enjoyed a series as much as &#34;The Walking Dead&#34;.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Tired of overproduced, corporate pop?  Where every singer is a shallow plastic-surgeried pin-up?<br /><br />Adele's work is what music should be.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Everything that should never be on TV is on TV in the biggest way possible. MUCH scarier than season 1 (no slouch) and brilliant re-use of brilliant actors. Buckle up and try not to eat beforehand..
B009AMABH6|5.0|\\"Cosmopolis\\" is great! This is how the story goes: 28-year-old financial wizard and billionaire Eric Packer traverses Manhattan in his stretch limo. His goal: a haircut at Anthony's, his father's old barber. But on this day his driver has to navigate a presidential visit, an attack by anarchists and a rapper's funeral. Stuck in traffic, he anxiously monitors the value of the yen on the limo's computer.<br /><br />The cast led by Robert Pattinson (as Eric Packer) is great. The directing & screenplay (based on the novel by Don DeLillo) by David Cronenberg is great.<br /><br />The music by Howard Shore & performed by Metric is great. The cinematography by Peter Suschitzky is great. The film editing by Ronald Sanders is great. The casting by Deirdre Bowen is great. The production design by Arvinder Grewal & set designs by Matt Middleton & Brad Milburn is great. The art direction by Joshu de Cartier is great. The costume design by Denise Cronenberg is great. The make-up design by Stephan Dupuis is great. The special effects coordinated by Warren Appleby is great. The visual effects coordinated by Michael DiCarlo & Naomi Foakes, supervised by Wojciech Zielinski is great. The stunts coordinated by John Stoneham Jr. & Layton Morrison is great.<br /><br />This is an interesting and entertaining film that makes you think. This is also a well-made and well-crafted film. This is also another interesting film by David Cronenberg, who is definitely one of the most interesting directors of his time, in terms of the different genres of movies that he has done in the past 35+ years. Robert Pattinson gives a subtly interesting performance as Eric Packer, a character that is very much different from his Twilight character, Edward, in terms of mindset. This is also one of the more interesting films of the year, a film that deserves repeat viewings, in order to, get into the mindset of the film itself.
B00AB0AXU6|2.0|I'll start by saying that I have watched all the previous movies in the franchise.  Like many of the reviewers here, I agree that that this was, by far, the worst of the lot.<br /><br />Action movies have a long and storied history of poor plots and little sense and the Resident Evil series is proudly no different.  Sadly, this has really gone to the extreme here.  I'm guessing that the director just figured if he had nonstop explosions, gunfire, and cleavage, nobody would notice the horrendous plot holes.  I'll admit, the cleavage was why I gave this movie the second star.  Yay cleavage!<br /><br />Otherwise, I might have missed it, but during the great escape sequence, they all have to get off the elevator, because the power has been shut off.  The elevator is their only way to escape, so they're summarily humped, unless they get it powered up again.  The good guys stand around trying to figure out how to get it fixed.  Cue the bad guys to show up and gunfire ensues.  Good guys go running everywhere, saving people and shooting back.  Suddenly the elevator has power again, for no apparent reason, allowing the remaining good guys to survive.  Lame.  No explanation, no hacking the mainframe, no hot wiring, no reconfiguring the deflector array to emit a phase tachyon pulse, no recalculating the flux capacitor to emit 1.21 gigawatts, nothing.  It just works again.<br /><br />Or the chick in the slinky red dress.  She has a gun strapped to her thigh in one scene, where the good guys are trapped in a house.  No other guns in sight, the dress definitely would have revealed any other weapons.  Suddenly a firefight breaks out and she now hands Milla her one gun and yet now has a pistol in either hand.  Sure, it always looks cool in a movie to be firing two guns, but magically appearing guns is a bit hard to believe.  I wont go into the inexhaustible supplies of ammunition, but these guys would have needed a truck to follow them around, keeping them constantly supplied withbullets.  Unless they were carrying all those extra bullets in their cleavage.  I hadnt thought of that.  Multipurpose.<br /><br />And then theres the final fight scene, out of the underwater soviet testing facility, up on the frozen-over lake above.  The good guys are making their escape in their sno cat, trekking scross the ice.  They are forced to stop and have yet another fight.  The only way to stop one of the bad people is to fire a bunch of bullets into the ice at her feet, breaking the ice and sending her into the freezing, nazi-zombie infested waters below.  I dont know, but I'm guessing a sno cat which can carry a group of people probably weighs a couple tons.  Firing some bullets into ice thick enough to support that kind of weight probably wouldnt do squat.  Not to mention, the unstoppable evil chick has a punch that crushes people's sternums and kills them in one blow.  She also gets hit in the face with a metal fire extinguisher, swung by a fairly large individual.  She doesnt even blink.  So why did her fight against two of the good guys go on for ten minutes?<br /><br />Sadly, this is yet another hollywood insult to people around the world.  If you add enough explosions nobody will notice the gaping plot holes and weak story.<br /><br />I wont delve into the horrible acting, you're watching a Resident Evil movie, dont expect Oscar moments.<br /><br />There are quite a few other ridiculous moments, such as the grapple gun which apparently has limitless cable.  The almost instantaneous results of the T virus, whereas it took quite awhile in the prior movies to effect results.  The completely ludicrous concept of building an entire mockup of new york, tokyo, berlin, and moscow, ostensibly for testing purposes.  We have an artifical intelligence that runs an antire corporation/evil empire that plans on eradicating humanity, but it cant run simulations without plywood sets and clones?  Jesus wept.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Nolan created a screenplay richer than the ones in any of the previous Batman movies. The depth of the allusions, the depth of the characters, and the social critique were all far superior to any of the other movies and went a long way to capturing the way the comic evolved over many years (the world of Gotham changed from a two dimensional environment into one that had a greater dimensionality and darkness). Batman was arguably the first DC comic that could rival Marvel's dimensionality of world and characters. Bane will be remembered as one of the great movie villains. Christian Bale was excellent. He clearly took this role very seriously. Enough said. Check it out.
B00A17AD36|4.0|Well i just got this album for 3.99 n got it cuz i heard Wicked Games and loved it. i had no idea i was gettin 30 songs forthat price either so even if only 10 or so songs were good id be happy with it, but he imo is a more gritty,raw and emotional version of Bruno Mars. Now mind you 30 songs is alot to digest at once so every listen through i peel apart more layers than the last time. i especially enjoyed 28, knowing, rolling stone, and lonely star. usually when a new artist comes out u assume that theyre entire album will sound as the lead single does and most of the time im dissappointed when that happens but this cd is similar to wicked games and thats a plus in my book. thanx for reading, Andrew

B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I found this film do be the best of the Batman series, the plot was undeniably very well written. In my opinion the casting was near perfect. The only complaint I have is my personal opinion of Christian Bale and that is solely because of the audio recording of the words exchanged with the set hand that went viral on the Internet....
B003IY48PS|5.0|Love this series of movies, Bruce Campbell as Ash was great. This is a movie and the other two movies in the trilogy is a must. Price was great and the seller was also.

888370536X|4.0|very portable, easy to store and to write quick ideas, rugged and tough to handle rigours of daily use.  if you compose, you need something to store your musical ideas whenever and wherever they come.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|i like this game, my son likes this game, what i don't like are the ads.  spend the 2 or 3 dollars and get the ad free version, its way to easy to accidentally click on the ad and possibly order something else.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|If you're into love stories, you'll love this book. Especially if you're in the young adult age. I loved it! I cried in some parts, I laughed, and cursed Travis out. It's just a story about young love.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|You need to be patient with this book, it's a good story line, with twists and turns at all points, never quite what you think you know it to be, but that's the fun of reading it.<br /><br />Not boring, bogs down now and then, but well worth reading, and you will never guess the gist of it and you will be well suprised as you turn the pages and understand the final ending.<br /><br />ENJOY
B001Q5395Q|3.0|this was ordered by my childs friend who went on the computer and clicked order.  apparently i was logged in and set up for one click ordering. learned that lesson the hard way.... we didn;t watch it.

B005EHQGTS|5.0|This works great.  I downloaded it onto my Kindle Fire HD so that I could remotely control my computer during class and be able to walk around the classroom.  It is wonderful!  I just carry my KFHD around with me and I can have the whiteboard reflect my actions.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|I was really looking forward to this movie, but it just wasn't that exciting.  The visuals are great, but the storyline just didn't do it for me.
B009MO57H6|5.0|One of the best horror films of 2012 and definitely underrated. Solid performance from Milla Jovovich and fantastic action and special effects. Highly recommended for any fan of this film franchise!
B003VANOFY|5.0|I purchased this for my son for Christmas. It was the only thing he wanted. He researches everything before buying so I know he will be satisfied.
0446554995|1.0|As a long time reader of the Pendergast series I was terribly disapointed by the latest book. The novel is very rambling and after 400 pages or so the plot becomes ,even for this series, far too bizarre for an intelligent reader.And WW 2 has been over for 70 years -do we really need Nazis for present day villains ? The introduction of the preposterous new -almost certain to reappear in future- central character means this is last Pendergast book I will buy.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I heard this book might give some spiritual uplifting, but i was disappointed.....really just a fantasy.  Maybe the movie for the cinematography!
0547884591|5.0|Superb book -- and it's a good cook book, too. First one ever that I can't put down. This will never be relegated to the book case.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Integration is great I love that you can actually stream music from the cloud unlike iTunes match.  Match uses a cache folder and stores music as it is playing.  I just wish amazon would provide a desktop option for this app so you did not have to use the browser.  If there was a user friendly desktop interface like iTunes they would have five stars.  Keep working on it amazon you have my business, I hope you continue to develope your  music products.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|This movie should really not be considered a comedy, the only times I actually laughed wasn't from something funny it was more of a \\"this is really uncomfortable for me to watch this with my parents\\" kind of laugh. It was awkward in many places and as much as I love Tommy Lee Jones and Maryl Streep I won't be watching this again. I kept waiting for Steve Carell to make a joke but it never happened, he was serious the entire movie and it was weird. I won't be recommending this to anyone unfortunately.
B008G59IKO|3.0|Not as good as Uno. Hope Tres is a little better. It was okay but I expected more. Neither were as good as 21st...
B00AG4NSY0|3.0|I hate to be a scrooge here but i will have to honestly say that i thought there would me more spirit, and soul.<br />There wasnt enough emotion or production going on.I kinda felt it was just thrown together for diehard fans.<br />I can't say it was a bad cd because i have found myself listening to it, and maybe i just need to release myself from that Bah Humbug state of mind. So please take this review with a grain of salt it is a pleasent enough cd to be played again and again
B007MU85D0|5.0|This group is so amazing! Such natural and raw talent, I am hooked! What a great first purchase for my Amazon Cloud!
B005NJU8PA|5.0|The 4 hour life is how my partner and I now live.  We don't view Tim's books as books, but text books for our life.  Each new books adds additional insight to how to get the most out of our time on earth.  On another note, there were some old scroll's found in a cave in a far away land.  In the scrolls, one passage labeled Anson 4 verse 15, states \\"if you do not buy these books, you life will almost surely be a complete failure\\".  The scrolls have spoken.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|\\"Same Time Next Year\\" is a movie about adultry and many will say it glorifies sin. But in reality there are many of us who find themselves in marriages that are comfortable and easy; marriages where there is still love but some undefinable thing is missing, something that makes all the difference in the world. For some it is communication, some passion, and for others they cannot figure out just what is lacking. This movie is about two people whose marriages lack something; not enough to destroy families by divorce, but enough they find themselves drawn to one another when that void is filled. Sin? Prehaps to some.I don't see this as a movie about sin and adultry, nor is it a love story exactly. To me it is a story about two people who love so deeply, they scarifice themselves in order not to hurt the spouses they do love but in different ways from the love they share. That they chose to have one weekend a year for themselves instead of a lifetime is the compromise they make in order to sustain their marriages and to not let their love destroy the love they have for their spouses. It's a fictional story but I wonder how many people have done the same? I mean, besides myself.
0446554995|5.0|I've been reading these authors, both together and individually, for quite some time and and this book lives up to my expectations. Still reading it.
B00003CX9E|1.0|BORING movie, probably because I am one generation too late to understand it.  It has been suplanted by &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird.&#34;
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have read three very incredible books this year. All three have been by the same author. Colleen Hoover has quickly become one of my favorite authors and does not disappoint with her latest endeavor. Hopeless is an incredibly moving book with twists and unexpected turns. A 'live' story that encompasses 2 lifetimes & demonstrates that true love can withstand anything. Damn this lady can write!
B00006EXDM|5.0|the songs were all the great hits i wanted to listen to and the quality was great. I recommend it to all stones fans
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is great, but it is also terrible because now whenever I meet a guy I secretly wish he was a little like my dream boy Christian...
B000K2Q5X4|1.0|I purchased this cd from the ratings it got, very blues/rock oriented, the best Whitesnake album they ever did, WROOONG, I have been a straight up blues, blues/rock, 80's metal, heavy metal fan for thirty some odd years and this cd is as far away from any kind of blues/rock as it gets. I usually can find two or three killer tunes on even the worst cd but I gotta tell ya, this cd is one of the worst  I have purchased in a long time, I might just throw it in the trash, theres not one decent song on the entire cd, It STINKS !!  It sounds like one of those contract albums they needed to make and threw together 13 really bad, uninspired songs to fufill their agreement. Buyer beware, this cd is awful !!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I want me some Christian for my own!!! This man is a hunky piece of YUMMM.  Highly recommended book :)
B004JN1CW4|5.0|I really liked this book but when Teresa died at the end I started to tear up but it could've went into more detail to get the reader really into the scene where Teresa died. That's what I think.
B00ARAN9JW|1.0|Movies & Video Games like this cause violence in America.  All Violence based 'R' rated movies need retroactively reclassed as NC-17, with no exceptions.  And the Video Game rating system must become LAW, with ALL GAMES containing Weapons & Killing rated NS-21.  No Sale unless 21 years or older.  Also, video game consoles themselves all need NS-21 ratings, since mostly they are murder & mass killing simulators.<br /> Avoid this movie & this video game, just endless killing & blood & pointless with no plot.<br />(one exception: Music 5/5 stars - EXCELLENT - I bought the sound track off of iTunes.<br /> The first song from the beginning of the movie 'Flying through the Air' is Awesome!<br />And the Last song, \\"Hexes\\", is DubStep Techno Beauty.<br /> A big thank you for great music!)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The story and characters are well crafted and written for beautifully. The book's honesty is something I appreciate and of course I'm not saying it's honest for everyone, it's honest for me.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all of Vince Flynn's books in the Mitch Rapp series.  This is one of Flynn's best works.The book moves through a  events that keep the reader engaged throughout the book.  The book ends with a number of unanswered character questions.  This leads me to believe that the story line could be picked up in future books.  It was very difficult to put down.  I finished the book in three days.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was absolutely exciting and amazingly romantic a beautifully written novel. This is one of the best books I've ever read

B0084B5TK8|4.0|A must read classic.  No romantic sparkling vampires, honest creatures of the night that just might keep you from sleep a few minutes more.
B0072PUC7W|2.0|I was looking for music for relaxing to put into trance. This puts you in a foot stomping, finger tapping, dancing trance. Music all sounds like leftover disco music. Not what I was looking for. Guess I'll check into Reiki music. I got no use for this type of music. This music put me into a foolish trance for buying it.
1439152802|3.0|This is the first Kate Morton book I've read. I can tell she's a good writer, but I think there's just too much unnecessary fluff stuff in this book that makes it boring at times. As other reviewers have said, there were times in the middle of the book that I wanted to skip ahead because it got tedious in places. It's a very interesting and clever book, though, with a lot of twists.
1449433251|5.0|My kid love this books. He will be very happy. I was looking for all books collection for long time.

B009A9BEHU|5.0|I've seen Coldplay live, and was bummed I missed this recent tour. This live album is a great addition to the library, and has a little something from all of the albums. Definetly a must for any true fan.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I would completely understand if someone gave this case a &#34;lower than 5 star rating&#34;. Protection wise, it's great, and that's the reason I bought it. That being said, I gave it a 5 star rating. But, if you're really wanting something that will work as a little kickstand, like it says it does, I wouldn't go with this product. It has a little groove for it, but unless you're really gentle with it, you'll probably keep knocking it over. If you're looking for a cheap case to protect your Kindle, buy this.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|A well written story bring into play magic, love and amusement.  The plot was well developed.  The ending was perfect - not contrived.  I found the book was difficult to put down.

B00APUQJLO|2.0|A few words to describe this film; drab, frustrating, bland. I am a big Cronenberg fan but this is by far his most disappointing work.<br /><br />The acting is awful (I'm looking at you Pattinson), the script has no depth or authenticity, and there is no resolution of this long drawn out story. The film is not even that pretty to look at which is atypical for Cronenberg. I just hope this was a single blip of an error in an otherwise long and successful filmography...
B00005214X|5.0|I love this record. I loved it when I stayed up past midnight to hear a preview of it (all 6 sides!) on one of the Album Oriented Rock (AOR) stations in the Seattle area back in 1970. Still have my vinyl copy, which I played the grooves off of decades ago. George Harrison had a single-mindedness and work ethic that are still astonishing. But of all the great moments on this record, and there are many, I want to draw your attention, just for a moment, to the last jam, \\"Out Of The Blue\\".<br /><br />Out Of The Blue is a full-throated blues-rock work out, couple a guitar players, couple a keyboard players, horns, and a mellow groove that's cool enough to enjoy without forcing lyrics or a middle-8 on it. The kind of thing musicians with a certain comfort level create without a lot of planning, and which sometimes lead to songs, or pieces of songs, or some happy memories. Everyone's doing their best to keep it going, with all sorts of ornamentation and little digressions between the players. And it gets lighter and lighter, quieter, simpler. Then it turns a corner into a minor key and gets even gentler, I don't know if they planned it or were talking as they played or it was really that Jungian thing, the collective unconscious. But then it turns another corner, speeds up and returns to a major key and just goes for it! And a 2 minute 'outro' wrapps it all up. Bliss.<br /><br />Maybe this was the best take of a song that never gelled. Maybe they were setting levels on the mics in the drum kit. I think its beautiful, but its far from universal. But what I want to suggest, as you go back and listen again, and enjoy it, I hope, imaging that they didn't work it all out in advance. Maybe jammed through something they liked and started tape, or were already going.... I like to think of the quiet bits as if they're feeling their way along, can't see anything, trying not to fall. Hoping something will turn up. And when it does,  they're on it in a flash, everyone made it to the other side OK. Whew!<br /><br />That's why it sounds so happy, and doesn't seem to branch off further, at the end. There isn't any more left. Its already all on the tape.<br /><br />There was a lot of excess already on record when this came out, and a lot of people were less than complimentary about the third, very informal, disc in this package. Between the Allman Brothers Live At The Filmore East, bootleg Santana records, any number of Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood projects, the electric sides of Crosby Stills Nash & Young's Four Way Street, Jimi Hendrix's post-Experience catalog, Live Dead, Ten Years After in the Woodstock movie, and lesser works... well, rock improv was pretty easy to come by, in person and on record, in 1970. And would continue to blossom, even now.<br /><br />And yet, \\"Out Of The Blue\\" moves. from part 1 to part 2, to part 3. I think they made it up as they were going, and its one of the very nicest recordings of that particular event happening.ther side OK.

B005LAIHZE|2.0|If you are intrigued after the reviews and watching the trailer, rent don't buy, the fact that it was a $1.50 I'm not upset, had I rented from blockbusters, I would have given it only 1 star.<br /><br />The plot is weak, acting marginal with ok action.<br /><br />Looking for entertainment, I would recommend any of the other 3 movies I've watched this week over this, Lawless, The Hunger Games or Trouble with the Curve
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|HAVE TO GET THIS APP!!! WAY BETTER THAN BTD4. TOTALLY WORTH $2.99. But amazon was a little behind apple when getting this app.

B0084IHVC0|4.0|Good plot and story but the animation could be better. I know it is an old movie. But I didn't see that much quality  difference from the DVD or even VHS. Thanks
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Iron man is one of my favorite characters from Marvel's heroes and the job that Robert Downey Jr has made personalizing Tony stark in these 2 movies has been really good. Lot of action and great graphics
B005LAII1C|1.0|Would rate this right down there with \\"Date Night\\". Very little funny about constantly seeing a teddy bear with a bong, and the Oriental newscaster striking his female co-anchor. Walhberg's character and acting were so good in \\"The Shooter\\", it's a shame to see him going in this direction. C'mon Hollywood, if you are going to put out this kind of garbage, at least let the consumer watch the first fifteen minutes of the movie before they put out any money for a copy.
B001NKI60W|3.0|Wasn't prepared for the musical aspect of this film, considering most of the actors can&#34;t sing. Story was a bit trite
B0097BO21G|5.0|I usually don't take the time to write reviews, but I just had to for this album from Celine.  This is the album I put on every year around Christmas time because it just puts me in a holiday mood.  Every song is great, some traditional and some new.  Celine's O Holy Night really soars!  I have never heard anyone else sing that song better.  And the last track is touching because she sings it with her family.  Anyone who has been to a Celine concert knows that she sounds exactly like her CDs when singing live.  She's the real deal.  This is a special talent with a special voice.  Buy and listen to this album.  You won't be disappointed.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|VERY GOOD MOVIE. LOVED THE ACTION. KEPT ME ON THE EDGE  OF MY SEAT. YOU WILL ENJOY THE MOVIE. I'VE WATCHED IT 3 TIMES.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|I have to say that after the first paragraph, I was hooked.  When you read it, you will know why - I hav never laughed out loud 10 seconds into any book.  Ever - before now.  It does get into some good, basic science, but it enhances the story unlike some authors who (seem to) do it just to make themselves look smart.<br /><br />If you like great science fiction with some great science mixed in, this is the book for you.  For 99 cents, you are silly not to try it.<br /><br />Go on!<br /><br />-Peter Cox
B0084IG8TM|5.0|GOOD MOVIE. IT WAS INTERSTING TO WATCH. THERE WAS TIMES IT MADE YOU MAD. AND THEN YOU START TO FEEL SORRY FOR THE ACTOR. REALLY A GOOD MOVIE.

B005NJU8PA|5.0|This book by Tim Ferris has transformed me, who never even cooked pasta before, to make Osso Bucco on his first attempt, and it succeeded brilliantly.<br /><br />Two important concepts in the book that really connected with me are simplicity, and secondly, what Tim calls the margin of safety.<br />Simplicity:<br />I got some cook books from friends before, but the material you need and the way to do it was just enormous and just put me off by glancing at it.<br />Tim really cuts down all the non-essentials (rigorously) following his own advice in the meta-learning chapter. One reason I never got to cook was that there was just so much information and how-to-do-it-just-right information out there. And most of it was way-over complicated. Tim has the magic to trim it down so that you can actually enjoy it. And his own criteria put me in a mind-set to enjoy it, with the key question: did I enjoy the evening and the meals\\".<br /><br />The margin of safety: His basic ten meals are set-up that they are not easy to screw up, (which is a lot harder than it looks to collect such meals). His easy steps made it possible for me to pull off the Osso Bucco and totally impress two friends, who I know have been cooking for over three years. The second time I made it (retesting if it was real or just some chance that I got it right), it once again came out deliciously!<br /><br />I am actually excited to try out new things in the kitchen now, with this initial dish giving some kind of confidence that cooking is for everybody and that everybody can learn it (and trust me, I did not think this was remotely possible). Apart from everything, it was the first real delicious meal I ate in a while. And I just could not believe that I actually had cooked it! As a side-effect, it created the kind of psychology that if I could cook a delicious meal, than almost any skill, given the right material and method is learnable.<br /><br />I also like how he gives so much fun and interesting methods,ideas, quotes and interesting cases. I also just leave the book on the table as my friends got immersed in it while I finished setting-up the table. In this case it provided the extra benefit of giving you some extra time to cook! Even if you miraculously still don't cook anything, all the information and stories and key insights into learning alone are just exciting and intriguing by themselves.<br /><br />Finally,My parents are coming over for the holidays, and I will now be able to cook a real meal for my mom, who had giving up on me cooking anything during her lifetime. So while for me, this Osso Bucco experience alone was worth the price of the book, there is so much more in there.<br /><br />If you'd given up on cooking, but really like good food, do yourself a favor and try this book, one meal from this book could change your entire view towards cooking!
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|Otherwise, you're just critiquing the sound/performance quality and comparing it to the Original London and Broadway Casts...! It sounds like the audio is ripped straight from the movie, i.e. with sound effects, singing while acting (which affects the quality of the singing). Anne Hathaway and Eddie Redmayne deliver. I feel a little underwhelmed by Hugh Jackman (especially in &#34;Take Him Home&#34;... sounds like he's straining to reach those big notes) and Russell Crowe's tenor-y voice is unexpected as the usually deep and resonant Javert. And it's important to note that it's highlights (including the new original track) and not the entire soundtrack. You won't hear Gavroche's comedic songs here. All in all, a little underwhelming but I'm sure I'll be listening to it voraciously after the film comes out.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|Great DVD, great price, fast shipping! I look forward to future seasons. Better than a banana sliver. Awesome sauce to the eleventh!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love playing Mahjong.  I also love the ease of ordering games and books for my Kindle from Amazon.  Thanks
B00A8KJK7G|4.0|Lovers of stop motion animation, and Burton's penchant for all things odd, will get immense joy from this feature-length adaptation of his first major short film decades ago.  I did not enjoy this as much as Jii Barta's Toys in the Attic which also hit theatres in the fall of 2012.  But I would still recomend it, and in fact, have purchased DVD copies of both of these impressive animated wonders!
B005K17RU0|5.0|works well with my kindle fire hd  i especially like the15 day outlook and the houly forecast.  best one i have found.
B004LSO6YI|4.0|Like most people who've reviewed, I really enjoyed this movie. The actors were wonderful and (most of) the writing and direction was superb. This isn't a \\"typical\\" LGBT movie, which is something I dreaded, particularly when it comes to the overused storyline of a gay woman falling for a straight woman.<br /><br />The script was surprisingly wise. There were so many lines I wanted to write down and save for later. An example was, \\"A miracle is when God gives you a choice, and you make the right one.\\" There were lines like that, and a number of truths about love and relationships that really resonated. I've recommended this movie to straight friends because I think those truths are universal.<br /><br />The one down side was that sometimes the \\"interview\\" portions of the movie were distracting, and seemed out of sync with the mood the film was setting at the moment. They felt superfluous to me.<br /><br />I supported this film with a small donation when the producers were raising funds via Kickstarter. I didn't know much about it, but I felt that good \\"by women, for women\\" films should be given a boost. I'm so glad I did that. It was a tiny, tiny contribution, but I feel proud to have played a part.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|You should expect an entertaining movie with Edward Norton and Jeremy Renner in it.  Both are good actors and carry their scenes.  Both quickly establish their characters and make them believable.  The movie takes off at a rapidly fast pace.  You must pay attention or you might lose some of the plot.  While it takes a wide divergence from the Matt Damon Bourne movies, it delivers a credible sequel that actually convinces you that Jason Bourne is wreaking havoc with the CIA while Aaron Cross is finding a way to save his life.  The action scenes are fast paced and numerous.  While Jason Bourne still seems more deadly to me, Aaron Cross can kill you silently and swiftly.  I would recommend this movie to all Jason Bourne fans.  If you like Jason Bourne, you will like Aaron Cross.
0345525558|3.0|The format is appealing: use flowers to communicate through their symbolic meanings.<br /><br />While the premise is intriguing, it didn't become great for me.<br /><br />I wanted to quit 2/3 of the way through because there were no characters I cared about reading about. I grew to hate the protagonist, because she was selfish and vicious, and in the end her redemption was not believable.<br /><br />This book is very much like some of Alice Hoffman's stories, in subject, characters and theme, but the magic is lacking. I don't mean actual magic, I mean writing magic where the author makes me care about the most unlikeably flawed characters through her skill
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book more than I expected to but about as much as I hoped to when I first heard about it. I loved the way the pictures were woven into the story, and it was great to learn at the end that these were what they appeared to be - vintage photocards. (I read it on my Kindle Fire and am sure the pictures would be even more fun in a print book.)<br /><br />The story moves along quickly and draws the reader in. This was an entertaining and exciting read. The story was thought provoking (exploring the nature of \\"the truth\\" and the way the imperfections of parents impact their children) and fantastical (introducing us to multiple time \\"loops\\" coexisting in the same physical space). I love coming-of-age stories, so I guess it is no surprise that I enjoyed it.<br /><br />I was worried that the ending would leave me disappointed, but it was ambiguous, which I much prefer to poorly tied up.<br /><br />There were a few times when the language was a bit awkward, which is why I gave the book four instead of five stars. I could never really decide if that was because the author was trying to write \\"more like a teenager\\" or if those spots were just not as well edited.
0307279189|3.0|I just finished this book, and would have given it more stars if it had been about the run and the characters only. I grew bored with the politics of shoe manufacturing, seemingly thrown in to make the book longer, or to create suspense about the last big race he was describing.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|Well-written and insightful. A great read for introverts and those who love/teach/work/live with them.  Susan effectively combines her personal story with research and interviews to create a compelling book.
B0032KLAKE|5.0|Loved the intensity.  The music is superb.  It's quite the &#34;coming out&#34; party for Edward Norton as an acting part.
B0067AC5KA|4.0|Overall, I'd give the series 4.5 stars. The books are somehow simultaneously slow moving, completely riveting, and action packed. The protagonists are workaholics who live by their own codes of ethics, with flaws, but with strong moral character (according to their own set of morals, that is) and integrity (same rules apply). The villains are heinous, but not unreasonably so (compared to actual serial killers, corrupt authorities, and gangsters). If you are able to stomach the violence (mostly sexual violence), suspend a bit of disbelief, and wait patiently for the comeuppance of men who hate women, then this is the series for you!<br /><br />The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a real page turner and establishes the major protagonists for the series.<br /><br />The Girl Who Played with Fire ends with a great cliffhanger and reveals that there is a larger conspiracy at work.<br /><br />The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest is more of a political thriller than the other two books.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|great book about how the infantry lived during ww II. and it was well written from a private's point of view.

B002RI91IU|1.0|This is a 'clever' trilogy - the same story is used three times, with slightly different 'clothing'.  As the 'plot' is desperately bleak and pointless, I do not recommend it.

B0099G6Q5E|5.0|Anyone who has seen the movie would enjoy this soundtrack!  there is such a mixture of music and great voices.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|The original \\"Dark Shadows\\" serial went off the air when I was eight so I have vague recall.  I remember my older sister going out for Halloween as Angelique one year.  As a Burton-Depp fan I was awaiting this version with baited breath.  A couple months before the film came out the devotees of the series went on the offensive imploring people not to see it because Burton et al made a \\"comedy\\".  My buddy, who was a long time fan and even liked the Ben Cross reboot, hated the film.  These dual forces persuaded me not to see it in a theatre and apparently others followed suit because it was a box office underperformer.  Finally seeing the film on home video I can state emphatically to the fanboys, \\"Are you mad?  Have you even seen the movie?\\"  \\"Dark Shadows\\" is terrific.  For those who say that Burton made a comedy for sure there are comedic elements but for the most part the narrative is played straight.  Johnny Depp continues to amaze with his mesmerizing account of reluctant vampire Barnabas Collins.  Clad in black with a pale visage Depp projects an austere courtliness even if his underlying motive is to drink your blood.  Eva Green is equally terrific as the devilish Angelique, a seductive witch who could tempt the purest of heart to the dark side.  The script is full of wit and memorably macabre throwaway lines.  The art direction is nothing short of stupendous.  Aside from Danny Elfman's usual sterling score Burton populates the soundtrack with some delicious vintage chestnuts.  I had chills running down my spine as a straightjacketed Alice Cooper sang \\"The Ballad of Dwight Fry\\" at a Collins family ball.  Afficienadoes of the original series may quibble with some of the liberties Burton has taken.  As one of the uninitiated I thought it was a gas.  If anything came out of this I bought \\"House of Dark Shadows\\" and \\"Night of Dark Shadows\\" because Burton's film piqued my interest in Dan Curtis' original creation.
0385536828|1.0|I finally gave myself permission to stop reading this awful novel, waiting far too long for the sparks from \\"Atonement\\" to ignite.  Had it given me even an ash I would have been happy.<br />I'm angry and ashamed for having fallen into another trap from a famous author who has lost himself in self-indulgence; or is it  pressure from a demanding publisher to get another one out quick?
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Hysterical. 20 something movie but my hubby and I loved it. I'm going to add it to my movie collection.

B004XDYJRU|4.0|The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 from me is that it lacks a way for the user to move the positions of favourites up or down the list . . . additionally, it would be good to have the ability to put stations into folders - - for instance by genre, language of broadcast, or country of origin. Having those attributes, this would be worthy of a 6!
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Loved it ! Story was smart and well written.  They did a good job of pulling from previous movies so the new character didn't seem out of place. Ed Norton's performance was flawless.
B009LK6JS2|2.0|It's too hard to control.  The jet always wants to fly upside down no matter which way I hold the Kindle.

B0073LWEXK|5.0|The graphics are very good.  It's easy to travel between scenes.  It's challenging to find all the clues and when you find them another scene opens for exploring.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I finally read this book after falling in love with the movie (I didn't know it was based off a book).  I loved it! Perfectly charming in the characters and storyline.  It has made its way into my list of books that I will read over and over again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read the first short book of this series for free. It ends with a nice hook, but also sets up a really intriguing post apocalyptic setting, so I immediately bought the rest of the series. I burned through them quicker than any book I have read in a long time. I connected to the character very quickly, and became fascinated with the environment that they lived in.<br />The whole idea for this story is probably the most creative one I have encountered for this genre. Some aspects are sci fi, but not to the point that anyone couldn't enjoy it. I have recommended this book to several people, and have purchased the two follow on books to the series myself. Considering the price, this book is definitely worth it. The writing is good, but not amazing. With that said, character development and imagery are fantastic, and coupled with such a unique concept makes for a very entertaining read.
B003ZMF26W|5.0|This was a present for a friend, he liked it, I did not tested it, but from the reviews it seems like a very decent mouse.

B00633W614|5.0|Jeffrey Archer is a wonderful storyteller. This book is part of a series, The Clifton Chronicles, and can be readf sequentially or as a stand-alone novel. As each book came  to an end I couldn't wait to get to the next one. His bad guys are really bad and his good guys are great.  Can't wait for the next one.

B004DLPXAO|4.0|Works great with my apple iPad. Having trouble with an android driven tablet however. Have not yet been able to download to a Polaroid tablet.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I'm halfway through this book, so I can't comment about the ending, but I am truly enjoying this read. (It's an early Christmas present to myself, and I must say that I've outdone myself this year!) The leading characters have the seriocomic believability of real people - very well developed. The dialog is witty without being inaccessible, and the plot twists happen just often enough to hold my interest. I already know that I will buy and read more of Gillian Flynn's work. And I'll certainly watch out for the temptation to act like a Cool Girl...
B006LSZECO|4.0|Couldn't put it down even at 4 a.m. after reading all night. Only reason I did not give it 5 stars was the anticlimatic ending.
B009HELT3C|4.0|This movie is good for an enjoyable evening's entertainment with the traditional bowl of pop corn. It continues the &#34;story line&#34; from the previous movies in the series.

B008FSCNTK|5.0|first of all, anyone who mentions the cover photo in the review of an album, positive or negative, needs to get a a life.<br /><br />second, what happened to civility ? what's with all the ugliness ? why can't you just say \\"i love Diana but this isn't my cup of tea\\" ? anyone who claims to be a fan of Diana and then trashes this album with nastiness should be ashamed of themselves. have you read anything about how personal this album is to her and her memories of growing up to this music. would you say these nasty things to her face if you met her or does the anonymity of the internet bring out your dark side ? i think if she read some of these reviews she'd be happy to consider you an ex-fan ....<br /><br />finally, as a long time fan and someone who has seen Diana live 4 times, this is another great addition to her discography. gorgeous music. give it a shot.

B00AHSIQWE|3.0|I thought it was okay. I was not impressed overall. I felt that Bane's character could have been better developed, as well as that of the Catwoman. Visually it was exciting, but other than that I would say it was &#34;so-so&#34;. Felt more like the boring knight than the dark knight
B0071T4BVC|2.0|I was excited for a new album from Paul -- didn't realize that \\"Kisses on the Bottom\\" was THAT \\"Kisses on the Bottom.\\" So as sad as I am that he is getting old, he is making himself seem SOO much older by wheeling out these old-timey hits from back when he was a baby -- way before my time. So while I can appreciate an old Louis Armstrong album and have cds with Fred Astaire singing some of his danceable tunes, I just don't want or need it from Sir Paul. I'll stick with the old-timey hits from back when I was a baby -- LOL, that would be the Beatles. ;) Love Paul, love old music; I just don't love this.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|SEEMS FAIRLY BASIC. I LIKE THE COLOR KEYS AND THE MEMORY ABILITY BETTER THAN MY OLD APP. IT WORKS GOOD.
B008AX1HD8|4.0|Jo Nesbo's compelling series of thrillers featuring the ascetic but troubled detective, Harry Hole, has added a new and hugely entertaining character to the genre. Like Henning Mankel's Walander, Hole is more anti-hero than superhero, and he's certainly both fallible and unquestionably human - which is probably one of the reasons why he endears himself to the reader so unequivocally. 'The Bat' was Nesbo's debut novel, but has only recently become available in English, despite the fact that Harry's Australian adventure is frequently referred to in subsequent Hole novels. Those already familiar with Harry's nail-biting, rivetting and often excruciating adventures will be pleased with this opportunity to finally learn what happened when the often-inebriated dectective is sent to Australia, ostensibly to assist with a murder investigation involving a Norwegian national. But as Harry Hole novels go, this one isn't nearly as taut or intricate as some Nesbo's later efforts, although it's still a well-told and gripping work. So, perhaps it shouldn't be the first-time Nesbo reader's first choice - opt for 'Red Breast' or 'The Devil's Star' instead. There is a definite chronography to the Hole novels, but not to the extent that reading them out of sequence will get in the way of enjoying what are truly clever, well crafted and beautifully observed tales.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|First series I ever read (lame I know), but it was good enough to keep me reading other books, so that says something.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|My nephew loves this gift.  He has a little difficulty (as a 6 year old) in folding the case to make the carrying case and various platforms to play the different star wars games or whatever kids do with star wars figures and legos! ha!  But for a kid that is mostly a gamer and  largely not impressed with most in-hand manipulatives, he even told me he loves the star wars legos.  He especially likes the little figures that come with it.  Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who loves star wars and legos.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I thought this was the best book of the three, not that either of the other 2 are bad, but I really did enjoy this one. Definitely worth the read.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It was free so I can't really complain about it hug good haha oh 20 wore my shift out so complex oh don't don't
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|GREAT MOVIE AND HAD WANTED IT FOR SOMETIME NOW.<br />FINALLY SAW IT WAS ON SALE AND GRABBED IT WHILE I COULD.<br />IT CAME FAST ALSO.
B001KPK6Q2|5.0|My 9 year old likes Taylor. She is so sweet and sets a relatively good image for my child. This album is kind of pop/country influenced. A nice album
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run!!! I was waiting for a while until this game came out on the kindle fire! It is super addictive and I love it!
B003YUC2FE|5.0|the toy story ultimate toy box collection is awesome and it looks really cool! i will enjoy watching these favorite movies of mine all the time.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|One of the best feature length animes. I really enjoy it. It came in perfect shape and timely during the Christmas season too!
B008220D0U|4.0|I enjoyed this action flick. My wife read the book and shared many of the same comments shared by other reviews. However, if you take it for what it is and don't care or haven't read the book, it is a good action flick that stands up. Good story that keeps you interested all the way to the end.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Definitely not for children, but for the immature child inside anyone over the age of 18!  If there are any negative reviews about this movie, you should have paid more attention before renting it.  It's not the movie's fault, it's yours.
B005O7Q6FM|5.0|The best cast on television.  Can't wait to see the next episode each week.  I make a point to watch each episode.  This is the only show I make a point to watch.
B000PVAFT0|3.0|The camera work was good (not great), capturing undersea life from an interesting perspective. Unfortunately, the transparent collectivist, \\"it takes a village\\" theme made this a propaganda piece. Yes, things work together in an ecosystem and there is a balance. Ironically, the agenda is undermined by the script itself. The \\"can't we all get along\\" premise is negated by the miracle that sea turtles can find a \\"living room\\" sized area of the ocean to have their shells cleaned by other species. Non-believers might relish this. For others, turn down the volume and enjoy an undersea screensaver.
B0043WHRWA|5.0|One of the best shows on television.  Humor and pathos blended expertly together with great writing and wonderful actors.  Great chemistry among all the cast.
B0098G7AWS|1.0|I only rented because I had the rifftrax and it was still unbearable. Acting: mediocre. Story: predictable. But the stream quality was good!
B00846REIS|3.0|I was really bored w/this novel.  The Grey novels are much - much better reading than this novel.  I found myself wishing it was over sooner - than later.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|If you buy this book, don't let the scientific jargon slow you down.  It's actually a very good read and if the attention to detail that the author provides bothers you, then skip over that stuff.  The storyline is still solid and it's a good read.  The only thing that I didn't like so much was the inappropriate use of the almighty &#34;F-Word&#34; throughout the book.  It wasn't overly used but I did think that in most instances the author could've NOT used this particular word and still gotten his point across.
B002XXLKHY|4.0|Great Christmas movie. The girlfriend had never seen it before and liked it too. Can't believe it's almost 10 years old
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|While I love Brave, the video quality was very poor - perhaps because of my internet connection, but disappointing none the less. At only 4 dollars, I suppose it was still worth the money.
B00APUQH0W|3.0|Its worth a rental.  My wife even stated it was just ok.  Glad we didn't go to the theater to see it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote to gather bits, segments, pages, images, notes, guides and ideas and then actually organize, access, and manipulate the data using either\all of my notebook PC, desktop PC, Galaxy smartphone, Kindle, and anyone I may choose. It's one of the few flexible and useful applications I've ever used. Plus: the price can't be beat.<br /><br />My computer programming and user experience began with punch-card computing on shared, super-expensive  monster IBM's and the origins of the PC - pre-PC microprocessor implementations to the present. (Wow! What a ride so far!) I'm eagerly anticipating the future of the Industry. Evernote will be my choice for simple gathering and organizing diverse data for any end use.
B00153ZC8Q|5.0|The movie that started it all. Can't get any better for the sci-fi  addict, and this is Schwarzenegger at his best.
B001706I5I|5.0|My kids loooooooveee this movie. I will definitely have to buy it next year. Jim Carry is soooo funny. we watched it twice during the 24 hr rental
1465001123|5.0|Taylor Swift fan gets a new calendar every year.  No fan would ever be disappointed in this beautiful annual calendar.
B007DIQC90|5.0|Gift for daughter in law. Hope it meets her need as she put it on her Christmas stocking list. Merry christmas
B008XG1X18|5.0|I don't know what I did before the days of Pinterest!!  There is so much information that people gather and post, all at our fingertips!
1451648537|5.0|\\"Here's to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes... the ones who see things differently -- they're not fond of rules... You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can't do is ignore them because they change things... they push the human race forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do.\\" -- Steve Jobs<br /><br />The quote above is one of my favorites from the book. There are many great lines that will be quoted for years.<br /><br />Steve Jobs had a strong need that somebody would write a biography about him. He thought that someone would write one after his death anyway, but then it would not be the truth. He didn't want to have any control over the content of the book, but he did care about how the cover was designed. Some speculate that he wouldn't have liked the overview of his life, that maybe he would have thought of himself as a failure.<br /><br />Although I don't like Jobs as person -- he was really arrogant with his closed-ones -- I like him as an artist. He liked to step against rules, he was determined to get what he wanted, he had amazing intuition and imagination, he cared for every detail on his products, and he believed he could change the world.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I love this app becouse it is really really really fun.it is just like reguler pac man and nothing has changed about it.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|The story line was great. I think Wilson handled his part with the perfect light touch. A different side of his acting ability. It was good entertainment.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Good story and mystery.  Interesting to try and find objects.  Haven't finished game yet, looking forward to solving the case.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|have enjoyed this series a lot. definitely a horror movie and scifi fan. this movie has all the elements i enjoy.
1419705849|5.0|my son loved this book and the series, i bought more, this is cheaper then the store prices.very nice and arrived on time. perfect for my son for christmas. very pleased with this product. i would purchase from them again
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|This is one actor that has definitely surprised me. The movie is tight and action filled. Law is a good foil for Downey's intensity. I am so happy Downey has been able to turn his life around totally.
B008QE9VJI|5.0|It's a fantastic vampire movie mixed with humor and basic vampire rules! Everything was just right: acting, actors, special effects, story. You should watch it, but don't expect a horror movie or twilight-like B.S.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|The acting of Gordon-Levitt gets better all the time. This was an interesting take on a murder investigation by high school student. The hard boiled detective angle was excellent. I really enjoyed this different vision of high school angst.
B008S4YZCO|4.0|love this game, just wish I knew how to update on my kindle. Hence the four stars. But very cute and addicting.
B0034G4P80|5.0|My husband has been watching this over and over. Good action and a story that flows well. The acting is surprisingly well done.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I'm surprised at the reviews below 4 stars. Obviously it's a matter of opinion, but if you like Batman Begins and The Dark Knight I think you'll love this move. The film is a masterpiece of cinematography, and in a similar way to Lord of the Rings depicts an epic story on an epic scale. I think it's hard for people to accept this movie as rivaling the second because it would almost be sacrilege to feel they were somehow diminishing Ledger's Joker by putting it on an equal plane. Bane as the main villain in Rises is as unforgettable a character as the Joker in his own right, evoking both hatred and a sense of compassion for him, and really paying homage to The Dark Knight by creating a truly worthy end to the series. Nothing will ever take away the perfect performance of Ledger as the Joker, but every character in all of these films was acted to perfection, and that includes this movie. The whole rebooted Christopher Nolan franchise took Batman to a new level, and finally did justice to the comic and the intended portrayal of the world of Batman. If nothing else rent it, but if you are a fan it should be added to the collection. And if you like video games, start with Arkham Asylum which continues in it's own right what the films started.<br /><br />UPDATE: In reading many of the bad reviews, I have come to realize that most of the them took 10 to 20 seconds to give this movie a terrible rating/review out of boredom a.k.a. attention deficit disorder. If you have an attention span and like the previous movies, you'll probably be able to sit through this too, and actually enjoy it. It has a plot, and requires some thinking and attention to detail. A few people may find this genuinely not their cup of tea, to which they should elaborate. The skewed overall rating on this film is not deserved.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|Radcliffe does a very nice job with this story. It was well written and enjoyable. I think it shows his potential.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|It is no misjudgement that \\"Casablanca\\" is the greatest film ever to come out of Hollywood. Humphrey Bogart's rivetting portrayal of nightclub owner Rick has stood the test of time, and is only complemented by Ingrid Bergman's outstanding performance as his beautiful ex-lover Ilsa Laslo. This classic film made amidst the shifting global currents of World War II tells a tale of love and sacrifice the likes of which has never been surpassed.<br /><br />Rick is a seemingly narcisistic nightclub owner running the premier club in Casablanca. He is enjoying a relatively carefree existance until Victor Laslo arrives in town. Laslo is a fugitive from the iron fist of the Third Reich who is seeking authorization for passage out of French Morocco. With Nazi supporters all around, Rick knows that providing aid to Laslo is an unwise venture. However, Rick's existance spirals downward when Laslo enters his Cafe with his wife, Ilsa (Rick's former fiancee who jilted him in Paris before the occupation).<br /><br />Time has shown no mercy to either Rick or Ilsa; they find that they still love each other despite the hate brought about by the years of volatile separtaion. Rick's choice is not an easy one. He can either escape with the woman he loves to Lisbon(leaving Laslo at the mercy of the Nazis), or sacrifice all that he has worked to achieve and help the fugitive couple escape to freedom.<br /><br />Don't deny yourself the opportunity to own the greatest drama to ever grace the silver screen. Once you see it you'll love it, and as the underlying themesong of the film says, you'll only love it more \\"As Time Goes By.\\"
B005FISBTO|5.0|My husband actually watched this season. He was not a Dexter fan initially but started watching and is now hooked. He even wants to watch the other 5 seasons. I think Hall is an excellent actor and has done a brilliant job with the character. This is the only TV series I have ever watched that far outstrips the book series. I also love the books!!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Awesome movie! The music was great, a lot of fun. The cast was hilarious, Anna Kendrick is going places. Definitely recommend it!
B006QVRVJK|4.0|The acting is excellent. This look at upper middle class families trying to impress even people they do not like is so real. I was pleased with this movie.
B004LROMWU|5.0|Got really wrapped up in this program.  Fiction yes, but could have more revelation to it than most would want to acknowledge.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|this book has to be one  of the best ever! it made me feel different emotions such as love, happiness, sadness, and hope. it made me cry, laugh, it gave me butterflies in my stomach and it made me fall inlove.<br /><br />i love Sky and im inlove with Holder!<br /><br />thank you Colleen for this work of art!!!
B003VANOFY|5.0|I bought this headset to game quietly while having good surround sound...This thing easily replaces a stereo.  If you're looking for a stereo or 5.1 surround for your computer setup, get this instead, you won't be let down!<br /><br />Not only is this the most comfortable headset I've ever owned, the sound quality is amazing.  I couldn't believe the bass I was hearing out of a headset, much less a wireless headset.<br /><br />The buttons and volume control are just a bonus to me, the software is a little strange but the set works fine.<br /><br />The mic is no less quality, everyone I talk to says there's no distortion, no background noise, and they can hear me just fine.  So as far as the mic is concerned I couldn't ask for anything more.<br /><br />I could go on all day about how great this headset is, logitech is my favorite keyboard, mouse, and now my favorite headset.  Logitech is a great company that puts out great products, and this is definitely one of them.<br /><br />The battery is another amazing feature of this set, it lasts for at least 8 hours solid!  And it charges off of any micro usb charger...like your phone charger.<br /><br />I highly recommend this headset to any gamer or anyone who works on their computer a lot that wants to listen to good sound comfortably.
1451696191|5.0|when i first read about the book i thought it would be good, but when i purchased it i was sure that i was amazing. one of the most touching books i've ever read, also one of the best movies i've seen this year.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|I bought this product wanting more fluid shots when I rotate my DSLR. I love this! It's simple, cheap, and definitely worth every penny! It was exactly what I needed to help improve panning shot.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a great way to pass time while enjoying the game. Love this game!!! I can play all day long!
B004ADH1RI|5.0|A really good, funny movie.  Love Chunk.  The other young actors did a fine job also.  A good adventure movie for the kids.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This book was great. If you read Gone Girl I definitely recommend this one. Totally different story but the wow moments are still there!
B005AERS74|4.0|This is an enjoyable download for the price, I am having difficulty with it in my iTunes but I think that is on iTune side, not Amazon.I would recommend this to a friends.
B003L77G8I|5.0|I really like Bones Sixth Season- So many new things are happening and it makes it very exciting. I always wonder what will happen next. I recommend it to all Bones lovers.<br />Marie
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|i was so thrilled to be able to watch the season finale on Amazon!! i thought for sure i was going to miss it. just like watching on TV.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|This is a great album where you get up beat and slow songs with that beautiful raspy soprano voice. I love every song and can't wait to hear more.
B0063IH60K|5.0|i play this game every day, while i am cooking supper or just to play. it is a lot of fun and i like the auto complete feature.
B005LAIH54|4.0|Great special effects and well done Greek Mythology depiction!! I would recommend it to anyone. Buy it- you won.t regret it!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I can't wait until season three comes out and I loved the first two seasons and glad I bought it.
B00AFWEPVI|2.0|i have not tried this product yet. i am so disappointed with you guys, i wished i would have purchased the nook or google.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Very entertaining and would watch again. We laughed and laughed  it was great would love to watch it again and again.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|I read a couple of David Baldacci's books and really enjoyed them - then I read the Camel Club and I had to read the series.  The way David writes I feel that I know all the members of the Camel Club personally - Warning once you start a David Baldacci book they are extremely hard to put down.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|It's like Fired Up! meets acapella. Anna Kendrick is fabulous, as always. Rebel Wilson is a riot. Must see movie!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It is so hard to find the words to write this review.Colleen has a way of taking out your heart and twirling it around in the air like pizza dough.Don't worry...she puts it back in and you will sigh with relief.This book was so soulfully written and the characters stole my heart.Colleen is such a talented writter....she pulls you into her character's lives and makes you want the kind of soulful love they have.Gosh....it is really hard to write this review as words have left me....its all feelings.Undiscribable feelings.
B005IQZB14|3.0|I wanted to read this book because I live in Mammoth and have hiked the John Muir and thought it would cover alot of the same area that I know.  However the author was unable to hike that portion due to the heavy snowfall the previous winter and that was a disappointment for me and for the author.  I didn't enjoy the sex and drugs and really hurried through that.  I guess I thought it would be more about the hiking and what she saw.  It took me awhile to realize this was really a passage in her life.  It was OK, a nice beach book, but as I say not what I was expecting.
1451695195|5.0|Interesting experience by a neurosurgeon. Different than other life after death experiences.  Encouraging, spiritually uplifting. Proof of heaven is worthy reading
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun game, easy to play. Graphics are good game is easy to move cards and fast. Only wish is add free would be better.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|My 9 year old daughter LOVES it! It is one of her favorite apps for her Kindle. She spends a lot of time creating pictures with this app.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Great book, very intense and deep. Would definitely like to see this book also be made into a movie. Intense.
0525953728|5.0|Excellent Book!! This book is enthralling. This is just what it says, it is a first hand account of the raid. It puts you with the crew in the helicopter going on the mission and nothing more. It isn't a technical manual on seal operations nor a deep history of the conflict. If you want those things you must go elsewhere. This book just tells a great story that is so exciting.<br /><br />This book is a story of one SEAL on the raid. About half of the book is dedicated to things before the raid. You get a good sense is that part of what a SEAL is. You get an idea of the training, the very intense mission tempo and stress these guys go through. The second half is an intimate story of the raid. At that point you won't be able to put the book down. You get a feel of how it went down. The author was on the helicopter that was forced down. His description of that crash is great. He then gives you a step by step account of going into the house, blowing doors down, exchanging gunfire, and everything else. It is so real you will almost want to hide as you read about blowing the doors.<br /><br />This book will enrich you. It is a roller coaster ride of a read. It will make the upcoming movie about the raid more exciting. After you read the book you will have a new appreciate for SEALs and in general for America's fighting mean and women.
B00A2H9LK6|1.0|Don't believe the hype or fan praise from people who love the games and are full of wishful thinking.  I am a fan of the games by the way...the CLASSIC GAMES (Silent Hill 1-3).  Even the games after are far better than this trash.  This film fails as an adaptation of the source material and as a film in general.  It is mediocrity at its finest.  Spending money on this is a waste.  The plot was dull and made no real sense.  Things just happen for no reason.  It is LOOSELY based on the 3rd games story but, of course, changes have been made.  The first movie was okay...merely okay.  There were cringe-worthy moments of dialogue but at least they tried to make a decent adaptation.  This movie feels like it's trying to ride the 3D gimmick for scares...and there just are none.  (Not like there were any in the first film).  Just a sad effort.  There is this one part where a doll/spider monster crawls around and it's just so ridiculously corny.  Then it just jumps all into the camera, obviously meant for a 3D scare...it is just laughable!  Silent hill deserves so much more than this.  It has always been about a more cerebral type of fear and these films just can't capture it.  I lost interest after the first 20 minutes.  SKIP IT, SKIP IT, SKIP IT.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It made me laugh at least 40+ times! I love  this book a lot! If you like comedies this is the book for you.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|If there is any utility that I have used on the Kindle Fire HD it would be this one. Allows access to all Apps, download folder, etc. Very useful for keeping track with what is installed.
B0079R8IYW|3.0|The case is attractive, protects the Kindle Fire, and does have 2 different angles to stand and read or type.<br /><br />What does not work well for me is the brace, it very difficult to slide in, it pops out, and it is not a good angle for me.  In addition, the rim around the screen is a bit too big and makes it difficult to access the pull-down menu without having to lift the edge of the cover.<br /><br />Elements that I would appreciate: ability to brace in the 'portrait' mode, ability to adjust for multiple angles in reading, a mechanism that could be used for hand-held in both 'portrait' and 'landscape' modes.
B004GFN11A|5.0|I write a regular blog and use this software for brief editing, and monitoring my blog, but mostly for reading other blogs.
B009HELT3C|4.0|Fun movie.  Josh Brolin does a good job, and will smith is good as always.  Ending really ties the series together.
B0076XIS4O|4.0|If you like M83, then do yourself a favor and pick this up. Just buy it and press play....you won't be disappointed.
B002DD67XG|5.0|James Taylor is one of my generation's troubadours.  I grew up on this music.  The older tunes take me back to my past, and I enjoyed the newer ones as well.
B00992CF6W|2.0|First it took a long time to download.  now my kindle is all jacked up and it wont play! When I tried to delete it so I could un jack stuff up it said the app wasn't on my kindle! WTH!
030726999X|5.0|So disappointed that Larsson died shortly after his masterpiece was completed.  The trilogy, including this book, is so engaging, so original for its genre that one longs for follow-up novels.  I've 'coped' by reading broadly in the Scandinavian crime novel genre, and though I've found some great reading, nothing really compares to these books.
B00456PKG4|4.0|Greta movie for some quality family time. It has great Disney story and lot of action we enjoy this very much.
B005FDW7AI|5.0|I am surprised this film isn't considered a classic.  It is as good as any number of children's books/films which are far more famous.  Don't deny yourself the treat of watching this.
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|Maybe part of the disappointment was due to the fact that a couple of people had Tim me it was the funniest movie they had ever seen. I love Mark but it just wasn't that funny, I had a couple of moments but I don't get it!!
B004SBULWE|5.0|I'm new in the Android tablet space and I didn't like the fact that Apps keep running.  My son suggested the App and it works fine.  I like the fact that it even kills itself freeing up more memory.  This should be included with Android's OS.
B0086700CM|4.0|it is fun and exciting and enjoyable .at first I did not know how to do it but after a wile I got the hang of it
0374214913|3.0|This is light, fun reading that essentially assumes everybody is really a whole lot like everybody else, and that everybody is talented or wise or intense in a way that can surely make for a positively-charged human community. No one is dull, everyone has quirks but no one is deeply psychotic or a sociopath -- even the quirkiest or meanest are well-intentioned. The puzzle and quest drive the action, and we learn a few very interesting facts along the way, and human decency does<br />triumph.
B005HSL626|5.0|i ordered as a download on my grandsons tablet, i am sure he will love it and best thing it was free
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|My kids all enjoyed this movie. It had some scary moments, but not so bad that I had to stop playing.
B0076DELIG|5.0|great read as always - Harry is a star in print - do not miss - love the style - read
B005LAII08|4.0|We really enjoyed this movie, but when it finished we felt it was lacking in something. Couldn't put our finger on what was missing, maybe some more substance to the story. The imagery was amazing though and the characters were funny and charming. I'd still recommended it even though my husband and I were a little dissappointed with the wrapping up of the story at the end. The kids loved it, although it was aimed probably above their ages - above 5 years.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Pretty easy to use and multfunctional.  I like being able to look at multiple locations and the 15 day forecast is helpful.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|I love Les Mis, and these are all great songs. The songs are not the full version(In My Life/ A Heart Full of Love starts with Marius, and leaves out all of Valjean's part), and I'm not sure if that is because they do this in the movie, or just for the soundtrack. ALSO how could A Little Fall of Rain, and Do You Hear the People Sing NOT be highlights!? Lovely Ladies is a staple, although not my favorite, but it's not on here so I will mention it. Who Am I is one of my favorites, and is also left off here!! I really hope there is a release of all the songs/score. I'm a little disappointed by this \\"highlights\\" soundtrack. I hope there is more to come, because some of the songs didn't need to be on here (The BISHOP!? why! we get it, it's a part of the score, but not a highlight), and Do You Hear the People Sing is THE Les Mis song!
B0053O89U6|5.0|There is a reason why the main actors on this show are always Emmy finalists for best comedy. Enough said.
B005CM9DX6|1.0|Having been a fan for many years it really annoys me that Micheal had the balls to call this Opeth.
B0046MVVOW|4.0|My wife loves Kesha, so I bought her this for her Christmas stocking. She loves it so much it plays in the car all the time. This combo cd has just about all of her big hits too
B008DL466C|3.0|After reading some of the creative reviews on Wiz's ONIFC, I must say I agree w/ some of them.  Not great, but to be fair Rolling Papers / Cabin Fever are tough acts to follow and our expectations could have been too high.  With that said, Wiz could have done better as well. However he is young and hopefully he retracts from the mainstream which appears to be the problem from my outside perspective.  Yes we know you have lots of dough and broads, but what's \\"new\\"?  I was interested to here whats up w/ that bald chick he was with at the awards? JK<br /><br />Music is an universal language like mathematics, but I believe Wiz may have missed the concept somewhat on this album a bit and needs to work on his communication skills.<br /><br />Young and will bounce back, hopefully.
B003Y5H574|4.0|I bought it for her for Christmas. It's not an unbearable movie for guys to watch either. There's some good parts to laugh at outside of all the romance. One of the more guy-friendly &#34;chick flicks&#34; out there.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is very very very very very good. I would like to change a few things (you don't half to add but I would like it if you did)<br />1. You need to play with ipods too.<br />2. You should add stuff like on the xbox 360 (minecarts red stone stickey pistonts pistontes all that stuff)<br />3.

B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I should have known better when my 19 year old daughter and her boyfriend rented this movie, and it lived up to my expectations...rude, crude, and socially unacceptable.  I Didn't care for it.  Colossal waste of time!!
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I thought it may not be of very good quality because of the low price but the pack is wonderful.<br />I can keep the camera body and 3 lenses in it easily, including a 100- 500 lens.<br />The compartments can be adjusted easily with the moveable velcro inserts so everything fits snug.<br />The straps are well padded and the chest and waist straps keeps it secure on your back.

B000HWZ4A2|5.0|The Movie is Romantic and Sexy  and has a moral message, Gary Cooper was a Superb Actor his natural good looks and quiet demeanor, made him oh so sexy and he did not have to take his clothes off.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Jeremy Renner's character Aaron Cross is a charismatic strong guy. His facial expressions are appealing and so real to the situation. He's my ideal of a real man. Smart, strong, cute as a button. I think he is just gorgeous. Lot's of exciting running, walking up buildings, sliding down buildings, car chases.  The music is thrilling!  Damon who?
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Luckily, I just went from a 6 core to 8 core AMD CPU and this still fits. That aside, I like this thing for it is quiet and keeps my CPU from dying on me. It only really makes noise when the computer starts and that is about it.<br /><br />With that said though it does have some pain in the ass qualities. For one, getting the thing on is hard because of that thing which presses against the CPU. Novices will definitely feel like they maybe breaking the motherboard trying to get those screws in if they try to put this on after mounting the motherboard to the case, also because of its size it may for some be an issue when it comes to the memory slots. Depending if your memory stick has a heat sink, if it is over the top then you may have some frustration with this.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's worth the money and does what it should. It also works with most smart fan applications for better utilization.

B000LTAY1U|3.0|Fantastic time watch, the quality of the piece is blatantly obvious. However beware the face of this watch is pretty small. I have a pretty decent sized wrist and the watch just looked awkward on my wrist. Your milage may vary though! They nylon band is pretty comfortable but will stain and wear with time.

B00499K9E0|1.0|I watched the first episode because several people I know highly recommended the show, so I decided to give it a try. What a disappointment! In spite of some humor and a nice portrait of Dr Watson this show seem implausible at best and Sherlock depiction seems cartoony and unbelievably fake.  I won't be watching any more episodes.

B009SQRL4U|2.0|My four year old knows who Santa is, but has never watched a movie about Santa.  This was horrible.  Some funny parts, but it was mostly dumb humor.  The four Santas, with three of them being \\"meh\\" or aweful, just doesn't set the Christmas tone.  Wish that we hadn't bothered.

B007EECSFA|3.0|I finished so that says something, but I got tired of the repeativeness within the chapters.  The author tries to switch from one era to another and in doing so you find you are re reading past events thru another characters eye. I found that I was merely scanning 3/4 the way thru just to get it over with.  The ending was a good twist though, that did make it worthwhile
B000MPEIF6|4.0|This was the first Resident Evil  film that I had ever watched. Found it to be very interesting. Really I enjoyed it!

B006LSZECO|5.0|Brilliant writing...dizzying convolutions, yet utterly fascinating. Highly recommended for the sheer suspense. The storyline is  so \\"out there\\"  that my ability to be seriously distressed  quickly gave way to an obsessive need to simply know what happened next.
B0054SMID0|5.0|Great 21st century film noir, hard boiled private eye and world weary lawyer vs suave baby faced creep all rolled into one...just perfect

1416594795|4.0|Greatest show on earth is a good book. It gives you a lot of information about evolution. Mr. Dawkins is very persuasive in his arguments.<br /><br />At places I found the book too detailed and hard to follow. Also, at every now and then, Mr. Dawkins criticizes creationists or IDers. I think once he made his point, it is no longer necessary to keep doing it in every page. People who believe in ID are continuing to believe in it, no matter the evidence.<br /><br />I agree that this whole process of Natural Selection and Evolution is indeed the greatest show on earth
B003L77FYS|5.0|i saw this show for the first time a couple of months ago. it is so witty. the detective cases are interesting and sometimes, well most of the time, bizarre. it is fun trying to figure out who is the real murderer. the actors seem to have a good time with each other and the burgeoning romance is fun to watch, right from the first episode.
B000YHG72E|4.0|Really cute - goofy - fun movie. Was appropriate for our 9 year old and Will Ferrel is classic.  see!

B00A81NFAS|5.0|There may be spoilers.<br />There is plenty to admire in this David O. Russell film beginning with the performances.  Somehow Russell manages to skim the surface of traditional dark comedy but never truly allows the story to sink.  This is mostly because Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper are perfect romantic foils as Tiffany and Pat.<br /><br />Both are emotionally and psychologically damaged.  Pat Solitano (Cooper) is released from 6 months of hospitalization for criminally aggressive behavior.  After catching his wife (Brea Bee) in the shower with a fellow teacher, he nearly kills the guy.  Treatment rather than jail seemed like his only viable option.  After his mother (Jacki Weaver) gets him out, he refuses to take his meds, for all the usual reasons (they make me drowsy, incoherent, etc.)<br /><br />At a dinner at his best friend's house he meets Tiffany, his friend's sister-in-law.  She has her own issues including promiscuity following her husband death.  He was a police officer.  Evidently, many of her friends at work were more than willing to take advantage of Tiffany's emotional weakness.  While there is always awkwardness between the two, Pat and Tiffany make a pact to help each other.<br /><br />Pat still believes he has a future with his now estranged wife, restraining order notwithstanding.  Tiffany needs a dance partner at an upcoming contest.  Tiffany agrees to deliver a letter to the wife if Pat will be her partner.  An excellent screenplay by Matthew M. Quick provides some great lines and humorous zingers for both leads.  In one of his best roles in recent memory, Robert De Niro gives a wonderful (and Oscar-worthy) performance as Pat, Sr., himself full of Philadelphia Eagles hysteria, superstition and acute compulsive disorder.<br /><br />Perhaps what makes this movie different from a traditional romantic comedy is that the film is believable.  Things aren't always pretty.  While improvements in the character's lives are there, they come in small steps.  When the film ends everything isn't perfect.  For example, when the couple goes to the dance contest at the end of the film, the final dance move involves Tiffany running toward Pat, who is to lift her above his head.  They have had problems with this move in practice.  We expect the move to work as we have seen in hundreds of other movies.  Here, just like in practice, Tiffany's crotch lands right in Pat's face.  Both Lawrence and Cooper manage to keep in the same character throughout the film.  Even as they take baby steps, they aren't cured at the end.  This is a solid, smart, award-worth film.l steps.

B007SGLZP8|2.0|The novel wanders all over the map and seems to never end. Stretches the limits of reality beyond believable. Character flying this way and that. It got past the editors because his name and reputation. Don't waste your time unless you have a lot to toss away.
B003L77GGK|5.0|The discs themselves were great. They played perfectly. The price for the entire season was insanely reasonable, and it arrived much quicker than I expected it to; which I've come to expect with Amazon (I just love that!). In my humble opinion, Season Six had to be one of my least favorite seasons. Don't get me wrong, I adore Supernatural, and I'm a fan of pretty much every season, but Season Six had more moments of dislike from me than some of the others. The season is good, but Sam was such a jerk-face, and Dean was a whiny thing that needed to be slapped. I still loved Sam and Dean and Cas to little bits and pieces, though. Both of them needing to be slapped aside, of course.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|Over-all &#34;Wall-E&#34; is a charming movie. I'm not going to 'nickle & dime' my thoughts, but I will say -- that it seems to carry a message that shows what may happen to planet Earth if we don't Stop dumping crap in landfills without any consideration of Mother Earth.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|So, I was taking a break from reading on my Kindle and I started playing this (I had previously gotten it for my teen girl). Now...I'm still playing it. I don't know why. It was confusing at first so I just did what I was told. The game won't let you mess up. Good thing. After i got the hang of it I was fulfilling some inane need for life accomplishment by playing this and i have to say, its too cute and entertaining to describe. You either love it or hate it. I didn't get it at first, but now its on like donkey kong. GREAT app/game!!!
B0038P59A0|1.0|The film has nothing to do with Sherlock Holmes except the name of the characters. Not for a real Sherlock fan.
B009RH973I|5.0|Protects very well.  Design and feel is good.  The cover is rigid and works well using as a stand.  I like the strap to also multipurpose.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I love this! The music on here is perfect and I've listened to this many, many times. I even got my husband hooked on it so now we listen to it in the car. The cast is amazing and I'm sad to say that I haven't see this show live but I know someday I'll get the chance!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I found I could not put this book down. I absolutely loved it and felt more often than not the same as the main character. Very beautifully written.I am sure this will haunt me for weeks to come. I cried and smiled and can't say enough good about this book. Definitely a rereader.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|At first I was surprised and a bit upset that it left out some songs but as I started listening to it I fell in love with it. I can't wait until I get to see the movie!
B007NVI1LY|5.0|The movie is a taste of what I imagine its like if you do DMT (hallucinogen drug).<br /><br />A very gut real movie, that shows action and consequence, and how the desire<br />to survive shapes the guys life in Tokyo.<br /><br />The movie contains many strong themes such as Oedipus complex, childhood-trauma, drug abuse,<br />etc.  The relationship between the brother and sister was largely shaped by 'an event'<br />early in their lives. (not spoiling it for ya)<br /><br />If you like psychological mind-benders, look no more.
0385535147|2.0|I was very disappointed with the end of this book.  I thought the book was fairly engaging throughout the first half, but then the story dragged on and came to an abrupt, illogical ending.  Towards the end, it seemed like the author just tried to wrap everything up.  Some of the actions taken by the characters did not make sense after reading the ending. If this was not written by John Grisham, I feel that the reviews would be far less favorable.  Not a bad book, but I would rate it as very average.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Great as usual, keeps you at your seats edge. need more writers like Lee Child, This would be a good movie also.

B009GED3HS|3.0|The non-hd version of this video has pretty poor video quality. I couldnt watch it full screen on my 15 inch screen because it was too fuzzy.<br /><br />The show itself was hilarious as usual
B00846TTDG|5.0|The average person probably has no idea of just how great our military is. This will open their eyes!<br />Watched it 3X now.
B00A0SLTCU|2.0|Probably wouldn't recommend.  I place the blame about 60% on director and 40% on the writers.  The first 1/2 of the movie is a senseless sequence of chase scenes and you don't even have to watch them because the pounding drums will start and irritate you until you have a 30 second break before the next chase scene.  Then the writers cut some of the layers in the identity crisis Quad/Houser is facing in such a way that it makes you believe they have no understanding of the PK Dick Story.  And finally, the city Quad/Houser wanders through is simply taken from Blade Runner.  They didn't even change the endless rain or the oriental voice making announcements for the city.  Poorly remade movie trying to seduce you with action when then content was the story.

B004MYF4SS|2.0|I guess the four star reviewers are those that enjoy getting beaten over the head with details of the weather and landscape and how strong the wind is blowing and on and on...  This book is not subtle on describing the atmosphere. I thought this would be an interesting mystery, instead it was a sad, depressing story of unlikeable characters that should have been classified more as an Oprah Book Club read than a mystery or suspense novel.  I bought this on Kindle and was able to tap my way through the book in no time, skipping the scenery and trying to get to the actual story.  There is a sequel to this book and then there will be a third.  I have no interest in knowing what happens to the mundane and depressed characters so I will skip them.  Re classify this book as sad family drama and see who buys it.  I wish publishers would stop hyping books incorrectly.
B000T433CO|5.0|This is a really cute movie and a perennial holiday favorite here at our house. The slow to bloom romance between the Winslet and Black characters is worth watching, as well.
B006H5120E|5.0|Its been a few years since I last saw this movie.  I have the DVD version and for the most part I like the movie but its not something I would watch on a frequent basis as I'm more of an action movie fan so am partial to James Cameron's other films like Avatar, Aliens, etc. However, I recently got a large 3D TV and a 3D blu ray player and after reading the rave reviews of the new 3D Blu Ray version of Titanic I decided to take the plunge and purchase this.  All I can say is - BAM! - it was like watching this movie for the first time again.  The 3D version blows the standard version out of the stratosphere!  The high definition is a serious upgrade from standard definition but the 3D takes it to another world.  This is what 3D is all about. The detail and depth bring out parts of the movie that I never caught the first few times I saw the movie.  The 3D draws you in and immerses you into the environment.  The depth conveyed during the sinking of the ship really brings out the intensity and enormity of the scene. I thought Avatar 3D was good and I thought Hugo 3D was good but Titanic 3D is at the top of my list right now for most impressive 3D.  If you have a 3D tv and a 3D blu ray player with 3D glasses then do not hesitate to get this blu ray especially if you liked this movie.
B008YKRRI6|5.0|I was surprised at the very high quality of the remastering, although I already possess many different incarnations of these recordings. Although not every one is 1st choice, the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 6th are particularly successful. For me the Pastoral is worth this box alone. The 1955 7th is also impressive, not being hectic like other readings. The overtures are well done too, the Egmont stands out in particular. At this price it is worth every music lover's money.
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|I loved this movie. I think it's better than the first one. I love Robin Williams voice overs. He's a very funny man. This has a nice story that ends well. It's like Happy Feet one with the dancing and music. If you have Happy Feet one you should get this one too.
B008YKRRIQ|4.0|Although being a Klemperer fan, I cannot say that every work recorded here is exceptional. However, I selected the following which are justly famous and deserve to be in any music lover's collection : Schubert no. 5 and 8. Schumann no. 4, Mendelssohn no. 4 and Midsummer night's dream. The Weber overtures are well done, especially the Freischutz, which compared even better than the Karajan DG version. With excellent remastered sound, the set is well worth its modest asking price, if only for the above works.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|I am an adult who loves good animation with a great story and this movie was above and beyond my expectations!<br />Very touching and entertaining at the same time...Arthur is so loveable!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Pitch Perfect is so funny! Even if your not into musical movies this one is a blast! We laughed the whole movie.
B002SJIO5E|4.0|District 9 is one of those movies that I bought on DVD (though I soon upgraded to blu-ray) on a whim and wasn't burned by a bad movie.  This was one of those times that I wish I watched the movie in theaters, and that when the hype behind a hit movie is largely justified.<br /><br /> STORY<br /><br /> In 1982, a giant alien ship grinds to a halt above Johannesburg, South Africa.  The aliens are referred to negatively as \\"Prawns\\" for their scavenger-like personalities, and are treated like garbage by both the public and government.  The Prawns are forced in a giant slum called District 9, and Multi-National United (MNU) is really interested in getting their hands on the Prawn weapons and engineering them for human use (Prawn weapons won't work on human hands since they're only made to work with Prawns).  Wikus van de Merwe, an MNU manager, is putting up eviction notices for the Prawns into District 10, and comes into contact with Prawn fluid that'll turn him into a Prawn himself.  He's being hunted down by the MNU and has to make a reluctant alliance with a Prawn named Christopher Johnson if he wants any chance to come back to normal.<br /><br /> CHARACTERS<br /><br /> For the most part, I thought the characters were done really well.  Of course, the best character is Wikus (Sharlto Copley).  In the beginning, you see him as a mild-mannered jerk (if that makes any sense), and doesn't really care about the Prawns (though he doesn't want Prawns getting killed by MNU troops).  The neat part of Wikus is that his character becomes \\"more human\\" when his metamorphosis makes him less human, physically-speaking.<br /><br /> The only character that I would say is closer in line to being the more traditional \\"good guy\\" would be Christopher Johnson (Jason Cope).  Out of the other human and Prawn characters, he's really the only one who doesn't want to fight, but is forced into combat against the MNU near the end of the movie.<br /><br /> The antagonists, such as Colonel Koobus Venter (David James) and Obesandjo (Eugene Khumbanyiwa), are good in their roles.  Some may complain that Koobus and Obesandjo lack depth, since they're straight-up maniacs, but I think this works out in their favor since for the former, it would dilute the menacing feeling if he was written to have sympathetic moments.  Koobus's menacing vibe is enhanced with his superb tactical skills when in combat, and while he's not going to rival the Terminator in terms of supervillains, he's quite effective as the cold, murderous maniac.<br /><br /> However, I wish that some characters, like Wikus's wife, Tania (Vanessa Haywood), would have been developed a little more.<br /><br /> THEMES/COMMENTARY<br /><br /> District 9 is noted for having quite a few things to say about humanity.  As stated earlier, with Wikus, his physical transformation into a Prawn makes him more \\"human.\\" Also, this movie takes an interesting stand by showing the aliens in a more sympathetic light than the humans, thought I think the allegories relating to the Apartheid in South Africa are way too obvious.  However, I think Neill Blomkamp did a better job at handling the way the humans and Prawns were handled than James Cameron did the humans and Navi in Avatar, since there was some nuance in the characters in D9 to make them more believable.  I also applaud Blomkamp for pulling off his message without the use of making the Prawns look like eye candy (more on visuals later).<br /><br /> I also commend Blomkamp for not just portraying the big businesses (MNU) as evil to reflect the \\"evils of humanity,\\" but also shows it through the Nigerian warlords (headed by Obesandjo) taking advantage of and brutalizing the Prawns for their advanced weapons.<br /><br /> STORYTELLING<br /><br /> I thought the way D9 was told was pretty interesting, as it's not everyday that you see a sci-fi film with pretty strong action scenes told as a documentary in the beginning and end like one.  I thought Blomkamp handled the fusion of documentary-styled film and traditional film well, since I thought the transitions were smooth.<br /><br /> SOUNDTRACK<br /><br /> Clinton Shorter's music for this movie wasn't bad, though I wouldn't put in the same league of the soundtracks in movies like Blade Runner, The Terminator, or Total Recall.  However, I'll say that Shorter captured the mood of the gritty settings really well with tribal chanting and other musical elements very fitting to the geographical setting.<br /><br /> CINEMATOGRAPHY<br /><br /> Trent Opaloch's cinematography for District 9 is quite good.  The cinematography perfectly captures the gritty and violent atmosphere of the Prawns' lives, and I think the idea of it taking place in South Africa is a neat decision, since it's not everyday that you get a sci-fi movie taking place in this part of the world.<br /><br /> APPEARANCE<br /><br /> What really struck me in a positive way is the look of the Prawn technology, especially their weapons.  I love how they don't look like totally outlandish guns more akin to a fantasy story in space, but look more like our weapons with a strong \\"alien\\" visual aesthetic to them.  This also makes them look pretty nasty compared to other alien weapons in sci-fi (such as the Covenant weapons in the Halo games).<br /><br /> The MNU's personnel and equipment were made perfectly in this movie, since they're a potent military force that also reflects the fact that they're a private military entity. This is reflected in the fact that the personnel have a more \\"casual\\" look to them than official military personnel and that they don't have access to really powerful weapons like tanks and gunships.<br /><br /> The looks of the Nigerian warlords were done really well for the movie as well.  They're shown as more \\"rag-tag\\" through their  dilapidated vehicles and dwellings.<br /><br /> SPECIAL EFFECTS<br /><br /> The special effects done by Weta Workshop are marvelous.  The movie combines \\"traditional\\" special effects with CGI, and you hardly even notice that the effects are, well, effects.  The mutations on Wikus's body are very convincing (these were make-up effects), and the same can be said with how the Prawns look (the Prawns were made by CGI).  I think it's funny that despite the very convincing effects in the movie, the pricetag for them was drastically lower than what was needed to make everything in Avatar.<br /><br /> ACTION SCENES<br /><br /> Despite the fact that District 9 is often labeled as an \\"action\\" movie along with its sci-fi tag, there really isn't that much action that goes on.  However, the action that does take place is done very well.  The movie decides to build up to the action near the end, which I thought was a good thing since it gave them more power.<br /><br /> I thought the scene where Wikus and Christopher storm the MNU building was awesome, as it showed the two armed with Prawn weapons and dishing out some unique deaths to the MNU mercenaries in the building (such as the arc gun making its targets blow up in a shower of blood).<br /><br /> The final action scene near the end was pretty amazing.  The MNU and the Nigerian warlords are after Wikus, and donning a Prawn combat exosuit, dishes out some awesome damage against the enemies.  The exosuit even uses a magnetic force to collect all the incoming bullets and uses them as lethal projectiles against those trying to harm Wikus, and even fires a mini bomb into someone's head.  In one scene, he uses the suit's graviton device to pick up a pig and uses it as a projectile against an MNU mercenary. That scene was one of the most unintentionally funny things I've ever seen.  I wish this Prawn exosuit was real, because I'd like to have this thing for home security.<br /><br /> MATURE CONTENT<br /><br /> This is not a movie for the kids since there's a good deal of gore and bad language throughout.  There's scenes with both humans and Prawns getting dismembered, blown up, and shot at with plenty of bloodshed.  One of the hardest to watch was actually against a Prawn, since MNU scientists start conducting experiments on Wikus's abilities to interact with Prawn weapons, and Wikus is forced into killing a Prawn with one of the guns (which is highlighted by Wikus begging to shoot at the pig carcasses instead).<br /><br /> FINAL WORD<br /><br /> While I wouldn't say that this is quite in the same league of movies like 2001:  A Space Odyssey, Alien, or Total Recall, this was a really solid sci-fi movie.  In terms of sci-fi movies that came out in 2009, this runs rings around Avatar since it had much better character development and storytelling, not to mention better action scenes.

B006H4DBA4|3.0|Bestselling author of an entire list of novels including the Shopaholic books, has presented a fabulous festive treat in the form of `six geese a laying'. This character-driven tale focuses on childbirth and how six expectant mothers are stressing about their births, all sharing the same inner doubts whilst having personal challenges to overcome. The main character Ginny is someone whom you instantly connect with, through her very real emotions and thoughts on the events that soon unfold in this compelling read.<br /><br />Ginny is having her first baby. She is scared and so clings onto those that surround her for support and guidance. She also is very disapproving and critical of Dan, who really does love her if only she could give him the chance. Ginny's challenge to overcome is one that is quite simple - to trust and believe in herself that everything will be alright.<br />As the narrator of this story I certainly felt that it was very brave of the author to write in first person, and which makes the story feel more personal to the reader so that you can connect with it and with Ginny.<br /><br />Geraldine is abrasive and matter of fact about everything. She is not the kind of person whom you would mess with, nor would you question without a second thought. Then there is Georgia whose values and expectations are raised exceedingly high. Gina who is smug, over confident and unrealistic of what childbirth is really like. Grace who is a young mother of only twenty-two is scared and like a frightened Rabbit caught in the headlights, thus looking for reassurance that everything is going to be fine. Then there is Grace who being so career driven has not stopped to concider how having a child will affect her emotionally, and that handing it over to a nanny whilst she continues like before is something that may not come to pass, as she experiences what it is really like being a mother...<br /><br />All the characters are desperate to be `perfect' mothers and who up until now have not really thought deeply about how their outlook on this birth, may not be the right one.<br /><br />This exceptional Christmas story is certainly entertaining, as you immerse yourself in each characters individualistic trials and tribulations that transpire as they face up to reality. The message is simple (and which distinctly reminds me of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol- where Ebenezer Scrooge is visited by spirits who show him how things could be if he does not change). This occurred when a spirit showed the women images of themselves as they are now, being a tactic used for holding a mirror up to each person. The clear message within is touching, affecting and memorable with the story ending on such a lovely note as to bring a smile to your face and a tear to your eye. As a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella I was delighted at this seasonal discovery, and since I have read it in a single sitting I urge you to do the same; as it was quite beautiful!<br /><br />A good read, not a particularly great read, but something that I really enjoyed as a chick-lit alternative to a well-loved, distinctive classic.now have not really thought deeply about how their outlook on this birth, may not be the right one.<br /><br />This exceptional Christmas story is certainly entertaining, as you immerse yourself in each characters individualistic trials and tribulations that transpire as they face up to reality.

B009NPKTN6|1.0|See the show! I don't know what everyone raved about this, some of the music was great ( my generation), but frankly, I fell asleep. Tom Cruise is not one of my Fav's!
B004UXUUJE|5.0|I got the movie after reading the book. I really enjoyed the movie and it highlighted the key points in the book.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Bought the first and second season of the walking dead for my boyfriends birthday. We are both OBSESSED with the show. It was a good price and came very quickly. Very pleased. :]
1583334386|5.0|Love it!  Still reading it and applying each chapter as I go. It explains what we all struggle with, lack of motivation and self-control, in a easy to understand and entertaining way.  It is inspiring once you understand the mechanics of drive and will power and even the physiological history of it.  It all makes perfect sense and you are more inspired to make the right choices when your addictive, impulsive brain is telling you otherwise.
B0002HZSMQ|4.0|This is a small dinosaur, just a few inches long and a few inches high.  I have no doubt that my 3 y/o nephew will be delighted to find it among Santa's gifts.<br /><br />I don't think it's quite as realistic as the more expensive Schleich line, but since the little boy in question could give a special ops team lessons in destruction I think we'll stick with cheap for now. :)
B008RA3MGO|5.0|I have been listening to this CD on repeat since I bought it. I like the way that Carly mixes vocals and electronic sounds. &#34;Call Me Maybe&#34; is my least favorite song on the album-- everything else is so much better. Definitely recommended for pop lovers.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great graphics and storyline! LOVE the bonus content! Interesting enough to keep you hooked. I was completely enthralled and the house didn't get cleaned! LOL
B004X4R49Y|5.0|Truly a classic, performances are excellent all around, and the subject matter strikes to the heart of the human experience.  Everyone can relate to this film.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I loved the final twilight books- very suspenseful with lots of twists and turns. Loved Bella's character in this book-She had many more layers
B002H09I0Y|5.0|This movie will completely paralyze you with doubts about which characters are a part of the scheme or which ones are simply ensnared in it.  It will have you constantly guessing, and seldom wil you be correct.  Wonderful roller coaster ride with fantastic acting.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Having read every Jack Reacher novel ever written and shamefacedly admitting that Reacher is one of my iconic representative of safety for the world, I enjoyed this story as I always do enjoy them. It was formulaic - if you've read Reacher novels you can predict the elements of it - with a splash of small surprises that I won't spoil the experience by revealing here.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|A really great movie for kids and adults! It's become one of my favorite stop motion animation films. I loved the story and the overall message of the movie.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The story is intriguing, the writing is compelling, but the beauty of the scenes placed in my mind by the descriptions of the surroundings and the magic were a wonderful surprise.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a great story. Colleen does it again. I read her other books and loved them as well and can't wait to read what comes next for her. Loved the storyline and the characters!! Sad it's over cause I need  more Holder and Sky!!
B004ZBFRTY|5.0|I already loved this movie so I wanted to purchase it on blu-ray.  The 10th anniversary edition has an extended viewing option and has additional information while viewing the movie - writing will show on the screen from Grandma Death's book and explain some of the scenes that were a little bit confusing.  Highly recommend!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put this down. Good, easy read. I wish there would have been more to the ending. I highly recommend Safe Haven.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|just finished reading this and it is a MUST read book.  I look forward to the new movie coming out based on book 2.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|Absolutely great movie.  My 3 year old loved it.  Seriously.  Talk about tons of killing, explosions, and guns.  One of the best action movies ever.  Arnold and Willis both make great cameos and tear up a little fuel efficient car...awesome!!! Definitely recommend this movie to everyone.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|We enjoyed this movie- great storyline? Would suggest to all age groups!  Fantastic Christmas movie to get you ready for the glorious season.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|A fun movie.  It's fun to see Simon Pegg and Nick Frost in different roles than their previous work.  The supporting actors are all great too.  Good plot, with well thought out dialogue.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Really Funny, didn't expect a stuffed animal to make me laugh. One of the best fight scenes of all times
B0081J9OWC|5.0|A good listen all the way through.  Makes me smile from the heart out.  Man On Fire is a great listen.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Didn't want the story to end. But when it did I was sad. Can't wait for the next one to come out
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Very funny! Really captured the Christmas season in a funny way. It is on my list of must watch Christmas movies. My kids saw it for the first time and loved it. Truly a classic.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Just what I expected Yeah Rod - nice duets and the CD came quickly and that is all the words I have!
B00ARAN9JW|1.0|A waste of time because the producer/director just put together a movie to keep this Franchise going. The  scenes in the movie didn't make any sense.

B00AMBLDEE|4.0|This was a good movie. It had a lot of action and the chase scene was good. I believe producers of franchise need to end the franchise while the going is good.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Great app! Easy and reliable. Always current and accurate. Glad I found it, it was just what I was looking for.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|The only way to watch the classic.  It'd be great to see the original film converted to 1080p some day, but until then, this is the single best way to watch the classic feature how it was originally cut.
B008A1TIOK|2.0|Max Richter burst onto the \\"post-classical\\" scene with two excellent CDs: Memory House (2002) and the achingly beautiful The Blue Notebooks (2004). Since then, his CDs have been of inconsistent quality, though always providing some reward. With The Four Seasons, Richter has found new inspiration.<br /><br />Perhaps he was inspired by the thrill of being hired by the legendary Deutsche Grammaphone record label. Or perhaps the inspriration came solely from Vivaldi. Whatever the case may be, Richter seems to have found a new way for himself, as well as a new way for Vivaldi. Unfortunately, this new way, though interesting, lacks the depth and panache of Richter's best work, let alone that of the Vivaldi original.<br /><br />Richter here uses two basic approaches.<br /><br />The first approach is to echo segments of The Four Seasons in a clearly recognizable way. When Richter adopts this approach the results sometimes sound like Vivaldi that has been crassly recycled into minimalism.<br /><br />The second approach is to take a small germ from The Four Seasons and use it faintly and subtly... to go off on a tangent... to get lost. It's this second approach that is the most effective.<br /><br />When he uses the second approach, the results can be wonderful. Unfortunately, this is infrequent.<br /><br />Richer's forte has always been the way he expresses sentiments of delicate longing and sorrowful beauty. This forte is challenged by the task of re-working the bright chirpiness of the Vivaldi original. The further Richter strays from Vivaldi's chirpiness, however, the more sincere and powerful his music becomes.<br /><br />In straying from Vivaldi, Richter shows us that new is sometimes better than recycled.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this is the best game ever on like a I pad or kindle fire.it is so fun.the first time I played or downloaded it I got addicted to it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so addicting. My kids even love it. We can't stop playing. My son told me to load the app and I thought it was hoping to be a kids game but I really like it.

B00APUQH0W|4.0|Trouble With the Curb is a good movie. I enjoy it; can relate if you have an old grumpy father or grandfather who loves baseball.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Simply the best mini-series I have watched in ages - if you are a fan of Masterpiece Theater, classic English literature, or English history, then this series is for you. The acting is superb, the character development is rich, and overall, this series will leave you yearning for more! We cannot wait until Season 3 begins here in the US. You won't be sorry about this purchase!
B00AE6SS5O|4.0|wish there was a way to skip some of the conversations but its fun and funny and entertaining game.  not good for children who can't read.
B009LXEBD4|4.0|these cds were of good quality and made good gifts for my nieces and friends there is a lot of fake cds out there
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|This game has a great concept, but unless you're willing to pay money, it is intentionally very slow. You actually have to wait until something you buy with in-game currency is delivered (about a minute or two real time!)... unless you pay real money.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Finally, there is a facebook app that has a functionality and feel worthy of facebook. So many mobile facebook apps do not have all the features or they are located inconveniently. Not in this app. It is truly useful.

B000002A46|3.0|Mariah is a pop singer, with a powerful voice. This is a collection for the popular music listener, as by now several of the tracks are standard for seasonal radio. With the strong vice as her one trick at this early point in her career, Mariah tends to overdo it, especially on `Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)' and  `Santa Claus is Coming to Town' . She does dial it back a bit for the solemn  `Jesus Born on This day', but the whole thing still sounds  a bit too much like she is leading a church choir.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app has great functionality and works as well on the android device as it does on your pc. What a great app.

B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Wow! When I first noticed the price for this product I was very skeptical. Paying about 15 dollars for all versions of this product is truly a steal.<br /><br />The movie itself is amazing! The scenes- oh what beautiful scenes. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I would recommend it.
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|One of my all time favorites. Put it on your must see list.great story for all ages. I watch it over and over
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Even though there are already many positive reviews of this book on Amazon, I need to add one more!  I really enjoyed reading Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore, it was one of the few \\"can't put down\\" books I've read this year.<br /><br />There are so many things that I enjoyed in this book, starting with the dichotomy of an independent bookstore in San Francisco and Google.  The characters seem like people you know, or want to know.  The introduction of fantasy elements is smooth, and they intertwine themselves into the story in a natural and believable way.  When one of the characters says he needs a rogue, a wizard, and a warrior, you find yourself nodding, of course you do!<br /><br />The mixture of young, highly technical people, and older people working together is a lot of fun, and written in such as way that both groups are shown to have valuable insight and humor.<br /><br />I'm really glad I waited to read this book until just before Christmas, Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore was so engaging and such a happy story, it gladdened my heart a touch.
B0055PMURG|5.0|Inspiring and aweaome! I want to show my student this movie! It shows that with faith and determination you can do great things!
0812984412|1.0|I wish I would have read all the negative reviews first before wasting my time on this.  I kept plodding through, waiting for a payoff that never came.  I thought maybe it was just me that found it difficult to get through, but I see now that I am not alone.<br /><br />One - \\"One star\\" reviewer already did a good job laying out the general outline of the story with details.  I'll just add that the author seems to like to kill off his character's friends, family and communities.  There is very little redeeming features portrayed in humanity or his characters.  So, if you have a bleak, pessimistic view of human beings and the world, you might enjoy the \\"bleak reality\\" of these stories.<br /><br />It doesn't fit my view of the world or humanity or our future.  In addition, I like stories that show the best in us, not the worst.
1589949811|4.0|First impressions (pre-play) were high quality art and lots of pieces to lose! 3 types of tokens, several card sets and even some assembly - makes for a complicated game. After taking a few phases/rounds I realized I would need to read the manual again.<br />And again... and again lol. READ the manual, or you will find this game impossible to learn (correctly). It does leave lots of room for house rules but I recommend playing by the book ASAP, or expansions will just get more complicated when and because you are cheating!<br /><br />The Core sets scenarios leave a little to be desired, but since there are SO many expansions and extras I think that won't be true later on. The cards included are easily used in a decent deck, even a hybrid deck very quickly once you learn the game and how it plays out. Only 30 cards for each sphere honestly is a little short, especially since many of them are filler cards or take other cards that don't come in the set to be valuable, making only about 20 cards worth having. The scenario cards are much better than the player cards, which is why you need to learn to play, because random awesomeness is still better than surgical stupidity.<br /><br />We got pounded the first game, mostly because we played like crap and to be expected didn't know what we were doing. Second game we polished strat and read the manual... again and then again, then took some junk out of the deck and then by the 4th/5th game it was actually easy for the first scenario. Once I got the hang of it I could solo it with a hybrid deck by the 6th/7th game so you will need some patience. You will get smashed the first few times.<br /><br />In the end I would love to have this game be adaptable as PvP instead of just cooperative, so you could play it both ways if you wanted.<br />Anyone with some imagination could pull it off, and I plan to when I get bored with encounters BUT having a standard rule set for such play would have been icing on the cake, so everyone wouldhave to agree on what changes to make in playing PvP with a co-op-LCG game.<br /><br />Overall, add a couple small bags/pouches for the tokens, couple more bags for the separate player decks  maybe even each scenario and I'd be perfectly satisfied even paying 10$ more. I hope to see a deluxe set soon too, with better quality pieces, maybe with some plastic, even tin/aluminum stamped tokens. That would be superb. A deck box wouldn't be bad either...

0385536828|5.0|What determines the shape and fate of societies? It's ideas and stories, and their ability to persuade us that in order to stay true to our beliefs, we must take action to upend -- or to preserve -- the social and political structures that surround us. That, at least, was the motivation of Cold War operatives on both sides who sought to win the war of ideas in the 20th century. In her book \\"Who Paid the Piper? The CIA and the Cultural Cold War\\", Frances Stonor Saunders documented the workings of the CIA-funded Congress for Cultural Freedom to support anti-communist intellectuals.<br /><br />In \\"Sweet Tooth\\", Ian McEwan takes this grand battle for hearts and minds to a human scale, by inventing the eponymous and decidedly less ambitious program by the United Kingdom's internal counter-intelligence agency, MI5, to bankroll writers of both fiction and non-fiction. Amidst the domestic and international turmoil of Great Britain in the early 1970s, the protagonist and narrator, Serena Frume, finds herself entangled in more ways than one.<br /><br />When Serena, a low-ranking desk worker at MI5, is asked to bring a young writer named T. H. Haley into the program, she relishes the opportunity to psychoanalyze Haley through his short stories. We get excerpts and summaries of those stories, enough to leave us hungry for more, but the story progresses quickly as Serena and her subject predictably fall in love. Just as we fear that this little world will unravel completely, McEwan sheds a whole new light on \\"Sweet Tooth\\", and brings the story to a fulminant close.<br /><br />This is not a conventional spy novel, and it lacks the scale and ambition of \\"The Innocent\\", the sheer emotional force of \\"Atonement\\", or the darkly cynical satire of \\"Solar\\". But it tells a compelling story about freedom, integrity, trust and corruption, drawing inspiration from the sordid historical realities of the Cold War. It feels in some ways like a reflection on McEwan's own life and times. The degree to which this becomes apparent gives the novel a light touch of narcissism, which is just sufficiently tempered by irony to not become a serious flaw. \\"Sweet Tooth\\" is perhaps not \\"utterly brilliant\\" (as Serena Frume characterizes Haley's stories, perhaps to win him over), but it's a challenging, enjoyable story worthy of McEwan's caliber.

B0094BB4TW|1.0|Apparently this app has been messed up for several months, the newsfeed only sows a few posts and the rest are grayed out with no pictures or clickability.  Please fix this.  I've never had these problems with my mac apps.  Get with the program.
B000WLIQP8|5.0|I enjoyed every song on the album. 'course it's a lot better than &#34;Nat King Cole sings Diana Krall&#34;. The ease of acquisition only makes this item from Amazon more enjoyable.
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|This reboot is visually stunning, the action  is terrific and the acting quite good.<br /><br />Unfortunately it is totally devoid of the reality twisting that makes PKD so fascinating.<br />While the plot-line is fairly close to the original movie in most respects, it has one big flaw<br />in that there is no question of the reality of the action.<br /><br />Gone are all the hints from the first film that what we are watching is a paranoid fantasy.<br />For that reason, the one scene where it is brought up falls pretty flat and uninteresting<br />and plays out clearly as an attempt to trick him rather then the actual appeal to sanity<br />it was in the original movie.<br /><br />As a result, this makes a perfectly good action film... but its not a PKD story in any meaningful way.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Awesome , the actors showed what real action and production should be . Big movies take note it not the budget but the story and execution that matters.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|This is one of those shows that has everything done perfectly... Characters, actors, story, set and film location... All of it! Just perfection. Can't wait for season 3!!!
B000085RPU|1.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE but the disk isn't even recognized by any system i put it in. This DVD will not play.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|This CD is a must have for any Rod Stewart collection.  His way with music is such a delight and I just love to listen to this CD.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|Although it is fairly well written, the device makes it a disappointment. All of the characters are pathetic including those in the stories within the story. Expect profound disappointment in all of them.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This CD is a tremendous example of what Susan Boyle can do with her voice.  Very inspirational to listen to this CD.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|At first song 1, Been away  too long, caught my ear. Hummm not bad. Then Blood on the vally floor, yeah! Bones of birds took it over the top and By crooked steps sealed my fate. Now I'm completely addicted. Every song is a treasure and I will buy another when I wear this one out. Plus the cover art is beautiful!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is fun but be warned read instructions for each game otherwise you'll be lost.Nonetheless it's an excellent game.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this is a great app for both the kindle fire and my iPhone 4.  I find the graphics to be quite nice!
B009S8PEHY|3.0|This CD was OK. I loved his oldie-remake albums, so I thought this would be along the same lines.<br />It's worth a listen, and I've kept in it the shuffle mix, so it's not bad.<br />Check it out. It's cheap enough for even just curiosity.

B0050R0XPA|2.0|It was mailed in a timely fashion but otherwise was not a good experience. The pieces were bagged haphazardly together...no organizational logic at all to begin with. Still, the most frustrating part was that there were almost a dozen pieces missing! We had to try to find pieces from old Lego sets to even complete the Winter Village Post Office! After hours of working on the village, it didn't seem worth taking apart to return/ taking the risk that it was even still available etc. For the cost of this item, this was truly disappointing to say the least!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Shocking expose of a totalitarian state.  How can a people be so brainwashed!  The world stands by while the North Korean people suffer such inhuman treatment.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great perspective, and easy to read.  I found myself invested in the relationship between Enzo and all the characters in the story. Normally not my kind of book, and I was very pleasantly surprised.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This is a good free game.  But if you build things early the game does not recognize it for progress.
B008NB0SQO|3.0|When I saw that Disney was releasing \\" A Muppet Christmas Carol\\" on Blu-Ray this year I was quite ecstatic for many reasons. This movie has been a part of my family's tradition to watch since I was five and it has always been a favorite of mine, as is any Jim Henson film. I was looking forward to seeing this film in a higher quality and having a digital copy to keep so that my child could watch this when we travel. Lastly I had hoped that Disney included the song, \\" When Love is Gone\\" which resulted in a heated discussion at the discovery of its disappearance on the previous DVD.<br /><br />Although I enjoy the new Blu ray of this film, I would take away all the bells and whistles of this Blu-Ray if it meant that the film would stay in its true originality. Disney has taken away the true meaning of this film and most all, disgraced the real message of this production ; that love, and the Christmas Spirit can always be restored. How dare they commit this travesty under the guise that the song upset children. I watched this film when I was five years old. It made me sad, but did not scar me from ever watching the film again. After all, I have continued to watch this film for 20 years now and still love the song to this day. I am more scared by the disregard of Disney in REMOVING the song; for it tells me that Disney would defile a Jim Henson film for such little reason.<br /><br />I hope this message, like many of the other reviews, brings this issue to light again:<br />You may glamorize a movie as much as you like, but when you take away a critical part of the story, you remove the true meaning of the film; especially a film as well crafted as 'A Muppet Christmas Carol.'
B004I744AS|5.0|Of several available dictionaries I've installed and used on my Kindle Fire, 'Dictionary' by Farlex is the best app of its kind, in my humble opinion. It has &quot;Word of the Day&quot;, &quot;Today in History&quot;, and other fresh new tid bits of knowledge posted daily - along with a complete and extended dictionary that is well put together. A must-try if you're looking for a well made dictionary app for your Kindle Fire.

B009VB97EY|3.0|It was pretty much what I expected.  Decent plot; nice backsides.  Channing has moves that will make you want to hit Rewind again and again.
B00AIBZJLG|4.0|I had seen the trailer for this movie a couple of times in the theater in recent weeks and couldn't wait to see this movie. Other than the trailer, I had no previous knowledge about what I could expect (I have never been to any Cirque du Soleil show before).<br /><br />\\"Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away 3D\\" (91 min.) brings a very simple story line (girl meet boy (the Aerialist) at a circus, boy disappears into a bottomless pit, girl chases after boy and eventually she finds him) to various scenes from a smorgasbord of Cirque du Soleil shows. There is of course no dialogue, so the visuals and the music are key in any such movie. First as to the music, I thought it was rather bland and uneven, but then midway into the movie we get a huge chunk of Beatles songs (Blackbird; Octopus's Garden; Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds; For the Benefit of Mr. Kite; Get Back; and later also While My Guitar Gently Weeps as the credits start), and immediately the movie perks up for me. As to the performances, they are outstanding and at times jaw-dropping (I particularly liked the trampoline performances set to the Viva Elvis music, but also the extended closing aerial ballet piece between the 2 protagonists is outstanding).<br /><br />Several comments: first, it wasn't until the credits started rolling that I realized this movie is in essence a \\"greatest hits\\"/\\"best of\\" Cirque du Soleil as it is made clear that all these scenes come from existing shows. Second, despite this being executive produced by James \\"Avatar\\" Cameron, I didn't feel like the 3D played all that an important role in enjoying the movie. Third, even though the running time is listed at 91 min., the end-credits are just about the longest I have ever seen and run close to 10 min. if you can believe that. Bottom line: although I enjoyed the movie and the visuals are at time stunning, it was not the \\"over the top\\" experience that I had expected after having seen the trailer some weeks ago. That said, I still have seeing Cirque du Soleil's \\"The Beatles Love\\" show on my bucket list!ue du Soleil's \\"The Beatles Love\\" show on my bucket list!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I've only read half of the book and it is amazing. Hard to imagine that children are born into this type of life while we here in America take this precious  freedom of ours so lightly .
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Love the versatility of it, the only wish I had for Dropbox is the ability to download multiple boxes.  I use one for school and one for work, this would make tasks even easier.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|What an entertaining film! I love pre-quels and this one has a nice twist if re-writing the story line. I wish the villain's (Eric Bana) character would have been more...villainous. Five stars is reserved for only the greatests but this film is well deserving of four stars because of plot, conflict, character development, acting, and cinematography. Anyone who give it less may be, \\"out of their Vulcan mind!\\"

B007WOFXB8|1.0|I can't believe I got sucked in again by Rhino Records, and I can't believe that Billy Gibbons, Dusty Hill, Frank Beard and Bill Ham don't care that there still aren't CDs available for ZZ Top's First Album, Rio Grande Mud, Tejas and El Loco which sound anywhere near as good as the original vinyl LPs.  Anyone who listens to the original albums and compares them to the remastered, remixed, re-recorded discs on the ZZ Top six-pack, must realize that the best and purest-sounding ZZ Top music has been lost.  That is why the problem has been corrected for the expanded Tres Hombres and Fandango CDs.  I bought those two corrected discs, then shelled out again for this box set even though I already bought Tres Hombres and Fandango, thinking that Original Album Series meant that the Rio Grande Mud would be the original album mix.  But, NO!  There's nothing new here, just the same old tinny-sounding late-80's remixed debacles.  Rhino even had the audacity to include the older versions of Tres Hombres and Fandango, instead of the already-released corrected versions.  Rhino just re-packaged the same old garbage in fancier sleeves, without caring about the inferior quality of the music, because they just care about minimizing costs and maximizing profits.  For those of us who were around in the early 1970's and loved ZZ Top even before La Grange, because they were a great blues band in their early days, it's totally unbelievable that the only way to enjoy that great music is to haul out the old albums and crank up the turntable.  If you don't believe what I'm saying, take a look at how much you'd have to pay on Amazon for even a used copy of the [[ASIN:B00006OYL5 Chrome Smoke & BBQ: The ZZ Top Box]] (which contained songs in the original mixes).<br />Bottom line, don't buy this Original Album Series boxset, unless you've never heard the original albums.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|bought it for my 16 year old niece and she absolutely loves the dvd set and the series , price was perfect also.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I loved this book. I'm now reading it for the second time. When I read it the first time, I was looking for similarities to her other books but half way through the book I realized just how amazing it was on it's own. It's definitely an adult book and is NOT a feel good story but the reader slowly begins to care about the flawed characters. I was disappointed when I reached the ending because I wanted to hear more about them. I'm now reading the book again slowly and just enjoying the language, scenery and characters. Read it! ...Just pretend that some other author wrote it.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This is a fun game to play at any age. It is free so the price is always right. Love it
B000ATQYT2|1.0|There are several important scenes, on the digital download, taken out by some bloody witch or demon. No \\"the love is gone\\" song or a scene with the ghost of Christmas present etc. I can't get over all the missed scenes that I love and grew up on. Seriously, how dare someone try to remove parts from this incredible movie. I'm incredibly disappointed by a movie that should define my Christmas mood. Find somewhere else to find the whole movie

034580404X|3.0|I expected greater literary depth and writing skils. However, the trilogy is entertaining and a fast read. Sexy and racey.
B001CZVVUU|1.0|I am always amazed at the nonchalance with which directors, producers, and singers approach French opera...Very few seem to get that there is a distinct style at work, which requires distinct artistic choices...Massenet is not a French version of Puccini!<br /><br />If you are new to French opera and if you don't speak any French and if you don't mind directors taking artistic liberties that subvert the composer's intentions, then this dvd is for you. If what attracts you to this recording is Villazon, you are better off purchasing his other recording of Manon in the company of the French-native Natalie Dessay. I think it was a strategic mistake for Anna Netrebko to attack the French repertoire in general (her French is worse than her Italian, and her Italian is atrocious...you get the idea) and this opera in particular (given that it is difficult to improve on the recent award-winning CD recording of this opera by Angela Gheorghiu and Roberto Alagna; all other productions are dwarfed by the astonishing Gheorghiu-Alagna one; but unfortunately we have only their cd; there's no dvd!).
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|Liam Neeson is always watchable and the cinematography is terrific. Not much of a storyline, however and the ending is predictable.
B009GZKO2O|1.0|If you have seen hundreds of La Boheme and now want to experiment with a modernistic production where the director takes too many artistic liberties of questionable intelligence then buy this DVD. But if you know the details of the score and the libretto and you have already educated your taste by listening to glorious productions of this opera (Pavarotti & Cotrubas; Alagna & Gheorghiu, etc), then I think you will find this DVD an ill-advised investment of time and money.<br /><br />To my mind, a production should be recorded only if it adds something memorable, while also respecting the composer's intentions. I am struggling to find things worth remembering about this production. In theory, Anna's voice type should be suited for Mimi, but her dramatic and vocal characterisation of Mimi is unremarkable and somewhat bland. Her pronunciation and phrasing are particularly frustrating. Piotr is a fair choice for Rodolfo, but again, what is memorable about his Rodolfo?<br /><br />I fear that we enter a new age where recording is getting so cheap and ubiquitous that the market will be cluttered with productions that do not really merit the eternal life afforded by technology...
B006O3MU96|3.0|Saw some negative reviews but decided to try it anyway since I didn't have the original BUT on install , saw that it wanted unrealistic access to my phone resources - that plus the negatives was enough for me to say no.<br /><br />Ok so i have been schooled on phonecall access... going to install the app and do a proper review.<br /><br />Thx Razer!
B00579EL18|3.0|I bought this CD to hear in the same opera one of the greatest tenor voices of all times - Corelli - and one of the greatest baritone voices of all times - Herlea. Their famous father-son duet is sensational and is worth the price of the whole CD. Rysanek has an enormous voice and I think that's the reason why she got such thunderous applause - I for one do not find her voice beautiful at all: it seems hoarse, damaged, and she often goes off pitch. This became especially evident after I juxtaposed her rendition of Tu che le vanita with Angela Gheorghiu's astonishingly beautiful rendition from her disc Verdi Heroines!<br /><br />But it's rare to get the perfect cast on the same CD - having Herlea and Corelli on this one is fortunate indeed. If what attracts you to this opera is Elisabetha, then this CD is probably not your best investment.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I liked the development of the characters and the twisting of the plot. A good study of human nature and our common faults and qualities.
B002Q9MZHE|1.0|La Boheme is one of the most popular operas, making the top 5 together with La Traviata, Tosca, Le Nozze di Figaro, and Carmen. So it's no surprise that the music industry has produced a steady stream of recordings to capitalise on this sweet romantic story.<br /><br />The film with Netrebko and Villazon is frustrating for both technical and artistic reasons. Mimi requires a full lyric soprano voice and Netrebko has it. But her rendition is unpolished and slovenly, with scant attention paid to the requisite Italianate style, with questionable choices of phrasing, and with recurring mistakes of enunciation. I am not a big fan of Villazon, not so much because of his voice as because of his tendency to over-act...his Rodolfo is too playful, to the point of becoming a caricature of Rodolfo.
B0040ZA2D6|4.0|I got this BTR cd for my bro. I can't wait for him to open it tomorrow to see his face! (tomorrow is Christmas)It came in the mail 2 days after I ordered it and also came in mint condition.
030726999X|3.0|\\"Millennium Trilogy\\" immediately concludes with \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" after the prior novel.  Lisbeth Salander must cope with her injuries and the resulting legal ramifications of her actions, therefore the plot follows a courtroom procedural theme.  Ronald Niedermann rarely appears although he is a murderer and cop killer.<br /><br />Several times the poor editing, the choice to not follow a chronological order, distracts the continuum of the story.  One section may occur at 10pm followed by a separate incident at 9pm.  Ultimately I couldn't get too excited about any character except Salander.  The moments with Lisbeth Salander create the strongest draw.  I'll more than likely watch the Swedish movies having finished the series.<br /><br />Thank you.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Five stars for Elf! We rented it because our DVD player is on the fritz and Elf is a holiday tradition for the entire family. Full of quotable lines, warm fuzzies, unforgettable characters and a gentle romance, there's something here for everybody.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|The selections that Ms Boyle chose for this album are obviously some of her favorites which we would expect. However, her musical interpretations of the songs are fresh and new in every way. In my opinion, she enables the listener to understand the story of the songs with clarity and feel the deep emotions created by the songs. Thank you Susan for this wonderful gift.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I really love The Walking Dead.  I can't wait for Season 4 to begin but I really wish this season was longer.  I don't like cliff hangers, especially when you have to wait months for the next season to begin.  I don't like that Lorie died but I can't wait to see what happens with the the baby.  Also, I can't wait to see how Daryl and Merle get out of their situation and if they are going to turn on each other and stay loyal to the people that have been with this whole time or team up and go out on their own.  Like I said, I can't wait to see what season 4 has to bring to the different survivors.

B0095VP8D4|5.0|I bought this processor to go with my 2nd pc build, the one for me this time and I have to say so far I am very impressed.  I coupled this with a Gigabyte GA-F2A85XM-D3H motherboard, 16GB Corsair Vengeance memory, 650W PSU and all is humming along.  I've personally overclocked the cpu side to 4200 Mhz and the gpu side to 1000 Mhz and everything is running smoothly. As you will read all over the internet, getting good temp readings on this APU with the stock heat sink is about impossible and buying a heat sink will be the next purchase for me.  I think I can comfortably get this up to 4500 Mhz with a good heat sink and I've seen some reports up to 4900 but don't think I will push it that high.<br /><br />I, of course, chose the AMD APU for of budget reasons, when you compare the price of this at 120 here on Amazon with the Intel processors at 220+ and add on the price of the motherboards its kinda hard to justify the extra cost for the performance increases you might see with the Intel products.  I am not a huge computer gamer, most of my gaming is done on Xbox but the games I have tried have looked very good with the settings on high with no performance issues (Empire Total War, Company of Heroes Tales of Valor and Lego Lord of the Rings).<br /><br />As I said this is only my 2nd computer build and it makes me very happy and very proud to see components I picked and prodded over for months come together and work.  It's highly gratifying and I have to say if you are even thinking about it, go for it!  You will be like me, sitting at it for hours just doing simple things to see it work.  Both of my builds have used AMD processors and they seem to make things very easy, which is good for us beginners.<br /><br />So, in short I highly recommend this processor and highly recommend you building your own, its fairly easy and very gratifying!
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|This is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen. Just plain stupid and not at all funny, just trash.<br /><br />Besides that. I was charged for it twice on my second day of my 30 day free trial and payment for Prime. The first itme I tried to view it, there was no sound. The second time, I could not believe such a movie was highly rated by so many.

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This was a great book that I finished in a day and a half. It was well written and made you think about life. The only thing I didn't like about it was that I thought it moved too fast. I felt like I didn't get a chance to become as attached to the characters as I would've liked. Other than that the book was fantastic and I would recommend it.
B001KQZ7I8|3.0|My priest recommended this book in a grieving session I was attending.  I read most of it, but never finished because it was too technical in the latter part of the book for me.  The priest thought it was a terrific book, so it would depend on your view.
B007REV4YI|5.0|All the accusations of the Bond franchise ripping off the Jason Bourne series are overblown.  If anything, this latest installment in Bond's new evolution takes the high art of murder to a beautiful new level.  The theme throughout is light and shadow, and the director makes excellent use of both to illustrate how death isn't dealt only in the shadows.<br /><br />The other theme is old dogs in a world full of Internet-savvy young pups.  Whether it's M (Judi Dench) or Bond (Daniel Craig) himself, they recognize themselves as relics of a bygone era in which satellites and video cameras do most of the spy work for them.  And yet that's what makes Bond so important in this modern age -- he goes \\"off the grid,\\" where the real terror lurks.<br /><br />Javier Bardem plays an embodiment of that terror, Raoul Silva, a brutally warped villain who has an understandable (if unreasonable) motive to kill M. Just as Bond has an unspoken duty to Queen and Country, the new world tests that loyalty by robbing first Bond -- then M, then the entire organization -- of its identity.  When politicians drag their doings into the light of day, the franchise feels invigorated because it's finally facing up to the ludicrous issues of the past.  Bond can no longer casually sip a martini without being reminded that he's drinking taxpayer's money.<br /><br />And that's a good thing.  \\"Skyfall\\" works so well because it's not just another installment in the franchise, it's a milestone.  Things are changing for Bond, in a good way, and it gives me hope that we can expect more out of this old dog in a new world.
B007SGM084|1.0|I am definitely not a prued(?).  Anyway, i started skipping some of the dialogue because it was too repiticious for me and not enough substance.  I have a friend that really enjoyed the books, but also skipped most of the sexy parts because they became boring also.

1452110581|5.0|Oh, to see ourselves as others see us - especially our cats.  This book of brilliant little poems by Francesco Marciuliano, who somehow has been able of get inside feline heads just to put us all in our place, is one of the most side-splittingly funny and discerning collections of cat thoughts and psychology on the market. Others have tried but few have the syntax and insight (and obvious copious exposure) to feline behavior that Marciuliano distills here.<br /><br />If you don't have cats, this is a primer for considering inviting one into your world (are you sure you want to give up your home and peace of mind to this extent?): if you are a cat owner, now those glances and stares and moments of being completely ignored will find definition.<br /><br />On any level this is an immensely entertaining book.  It quite simply alters the food chain concept  (or misconception) that humans are at the top.  Grady Harp, December 12
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time. Although some parts are weird... the movie overall is very well written and keeps you guessing the whole time. I was entertained begining to end ! Cant wait for number 2
B00APUQRPC|4.0|This is for die-hard Eastwood fans.  Eastwood continues to age gracefully and reprises his by-now familiar role of irascible senior facing the frailties of old age with something less than grace.  Both Justin Timberlake and Amy Adams turn in charming performances as a secondary romance develops.  The plot is a little predictable and dialog nothing to rave about but its an enjoyable flick and moves right along.
0446547573|5.0|My wife started reading it the afternoon it got here and I didn't hear a word out of her until she was done with it.  She does like to read and we are going to be getting more for her collection.  She reads books over and over again.  I only read them once unless it is a tool catalog.  LOL.  The book arrive in better condition than advertised it looked like it had never been opened let alone read.  It was packaged very well and I would buy from this seller anytime.
0679731725|5.0|I never thought a book about a butler would thought provoking. Read it becuase of reviews and awards and was not disappointed. Examines personal vs. professional relationships, democracy vs. oligarchy, even goes into some pre-WWII diplomatic dealings. Strong recommend - short and satisfying.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Enjoyable overall. Went into too much technical detail about brain 'mechanics'. I was more interested in the 'Hereafter' experience and in the 'revelations' he had in heaven. Rehashed a lot of NDE material I have read before.
B004JC16LC|3.0|As already mentioned in other reviews: the sources from which the recordings have been sourced vary considerably. I was bitterly disappointed with the quality of the CDS: many were scratched on the read side of the cd and the product came from the distributor of this box set and were listed as 'brand new'. The situation was never resolved and Am. does not care about customer care and service. Look towards other labels and read the reviews in the related customer feedback section about the quality of manufacturing; about the quality of the recordings. I have given this three stars because it is Wilhelm Furtwängler and for no other reason.
B00APUQRPC|1.0|At first glance you think great, Clint and baseball, but it seemed like the movie was just flung at the audience and every character and situation was a hyperbole of a cliche.  Clint isn't just a curmudgeon, he's downright rude.  Justin Timberlake isn't just simply wise, cute, and lovable, he was syrupy.  Save your money - get a Dirty Harry movie.
B0015KO52S|5.0|Great tunes and vibe! Super cool cover art! Check out The Dead Weather's - Sea of Cowards & Horehound as well. And The Raconteurs - Broken Boy Soldiers. And The Kills - Blood Pressures :)
B004WR125O|1.0|Would not easily work with computer and other devices, Would not easily work with computer and other devices. Filling out this form is also a negative.
B001AP11KW|5.0|Great tunes and vibe! Check out The Dead Weather's - Sea of Cowards & Horehound as well. And The Raconteurs - Consolers of the Lonely, and The Kills - Blood Pressures :)
B009JBZH54|5.0|The perfect amount of action drama and storyline.  Nolan's take of batman is perfect and it is shown in these three movies.
B000V5TV22|5.0|This device was purchased to work on my netbook running Windows 7 Starter and Polar View navigation software.  It is a plug and play device and works very well.  It does take some time for the software to recognize the device but that might be the GPS s/w seeking satellites and calculating current position.  It's bulletproof and I would recommend it if it is compatible with the navigation software you are using.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|It was good, but way too long. The movie could have been wrapped up in two hours and it did not get interesting until the final hour
B002OQT928|5.0|Of all the Ice Age movies, my grandchildren seem to like this one the best.  They especially like Buck and his adventures.
B007VYDFMS|5.0|Amazing documentary depicting the legend's life from start to finish. I had goosebumps at multiple occasions while watching this piece. What a SOUL!
B0057LUI0O|5.0|My 3 year old granddaughter loves this one.  She loves to dance, so she especially loves the wonderful music as well as the story.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I wasn't sure about whether I would like this kind of book. Reading and also role playing as a detective, but I must say I truly. enjoyed it very much so much I read it as often as I could even while watching my favorite Tv show.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This is a great movie! It might stay 5 till midnight for most of the movie, but as you watch it the time just zooms by. Again, this is a great movie (one of my favorites, not to mention my grandson's). But don't take my word for it...watch it for yourself.
B00969PR18|2.0|I like it. But can't use it like I want to cause only works with a wifi or connection. I need a map that works offline
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Bought this twice now for my son.  The clear one yellows over time, so we got smoke this time.  The clear one was still fine when we replaced it--just yellowed.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Walking Dead 3 has been most enjoyable, the zombies make up and effects are excellent and the story line is quite captivating - The Chemistry of the Actors works well and it's always exciting to see what's going to happen next -
B008LV8TSU|4.0|I read it because I watched the movie. I found out that, though the real story differs quite a bit from the movie version, they were both equally awesome.
B008M0NDOK|5.0|Buy this if you love FPS games....and fast delivery....but it needs to be compatibility with more games like modern combat 4
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is AMAZING it is just like temple run you should get this game it is awesome.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Warning:  block out an entire week of your life to be glued to the TV before watching the first episode.  You will be hooked on this show in no time and will find yourself not able to stop watching to see what happens next.  I dare you to watch just a few episodes and not continue.  Great show all around.  Fantastic story, filmography, dialog, and acting.
B007OWRBJK|2.0|This memoir talked about some of the stories that we have all heard but not all. While I know this was Pete talking about Pete, but it was though he was the only one in the band and that he never heard of Keith Moon or John Entwhistle. With how much time you have to spend together as a band, I expected to hear more talk about the other members of the band and how they helped shape who Pete became.
B00973902K|5.0|It's just one of those songs that stick in your head for hours at a time! A good work-out  song for me!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I don't have a lot to say about the book, other than it's original, mesmerizing, suspenseful, entertaining and I'm hooked on the adventures of the central character, Mr. Reacher. I suspect I'll read them all. Hoping for am amazon gift card from Santa so I can load more of Lee Child's books on my Kindle Fire!!!
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|Nice app to play for fun. You can choose your level. May not learn to play but still fun to play.
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|I can't find fade into you. Is it just me missing the bonus track or is it really not included (even though the sticker on the front states it is)? I ordered two CDs (one for self, one as a gift for this song...disappointed its not included).
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I gave it this rating because I love this soundtrack. my favorite track has to be Suddenly. You don't find many soundtracks that are done live and that made this one even more amazing as you can truly feel the emotion brought across in the songs.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The final book was just okay for me. A few twists and turns, but pretty bland. I think the author struggled with a close to the book, but found one that worked.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Great movie with funny parts and great singing.  A movie the whole family enjoyed.  We watched it over and over.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Remember the movie, There's Something About Mary? That was the first comedy that was, not just pretty funny, but funny enough to make me gasp for air. I would have told you at that time that no other movie will EVER be made that makes me laugh that hard.... that is, I would have. TED is now my personal \\"funniest movie ever made\\" by a long shot. Admittedly, I am a huge fan of Family Guy and Seth MacFarlane's work in general, so it's difficult to start into this movie without bias. You won't find any sugar coating in this movie. It is 100% Classic MacFarlane, only made for theaters and Blu-Ray. One could only imagine the limits MacFarlane would achieve outside of TV (Family Guy), without fear of FCC fines. Well, the unfiltered MacFarlane will not disappoint fans at all. The MacFarlane Hater crowd will only grow as well. In fact, all negative reviews for this movie probably stem from this crowd. I am happy I dont even know anyone that shallow.<br /><br />If you have children, send them to Grandma's house. This is not even one of those, \\"we'll just send them to bed and watch it then\\" movies. You dont want your children anywhere near this movie. Hell, the bear spends the first half of the movie pulling hits off the bong and the second half dry-humping everyone/everything. It is truly funny.
0345803507|5.0|Little hestant after reading some of the reviews here.  Bought it any way.  What a great book.  Friends and neighbors borrowed it.  Once you start on the first book, I couldn't put  it down.  Read all three in 3 weeks.
030759565X|5.0|A cookbook with pictures!!! I love it. I love Deb's blog and her recipes. The book is absolutely gorgeous, the photography is great. There are a lot of vegetarian recipes, which I love, but the book is split up into sections: appetizers, desserts, vegetarian, etc. It is great cookbook!
0345803493|5.0|After reading 50 Shades of Gray, I had t o get the next two.  Read all three in 3 weejks.  Couldn't put the book down.  Those who didnt like it must5 be prudes.  Everyone bowered the 3 books and took me 6 months to get them all back.  We all enjoyed the books
030758836X|5.0|It's a book that everyone will love. You must read it! I finished it in less than  days...I simply could not put it down. Very well written.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This was another good book by Vince Flynn.....keeps you on your toes with the twists and turns<br /><br />Good book, well written.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|I love the Musical and the soundtrack but I was very disappointed that it didn't include some of my favorite songs such as: A Little Fall of Rain, Do You Hear the People Sing?, and Lovely Ladies. I feel later down the road the full CD will come out with all the songs so it may be smarter to wait until then.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Love this movie.  JT and the red head crack me up.  Defenitly would recomend for any couple to watch together.
B008YJFF2M|5.0|Love it!  Been wanting a few songs from the movies, and this had it!  Hard to find some of the old tracks, so asked this for Christmas, and got it for myself!  :)
B0070Y46UY|4.0|While the book took its time to to get into the nitty gritty of Yann Martel's wonderful storytelling it was well worth it..enjoyed the bizarrely surreal, yet completely believable adventure of Pi and Richard Parker..think jungle book crossed with Tom Hanks' castaway..
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Love it!  Her voice is strong and real! No gimmicks. No lip synching. Adele can sing! I have not been 21 for a long time, but I enjoy her too.
B007SGM084|5.0|i read all three books in a little under 2 weeks. the first one wasnt that great but it was still really good. i couldnt put them down. the second and third book sets up the plot alot better. and i would have liked to get christians thoughts more threwout the book and not just at the end of the 3rd one. these books are explicit and go into alot of details. if you do not like to read things about sex then this is not the books for you. besides that much i would definatly recomend these books to anyone.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Loved this movie! Made a great Christmas gift!<br />Rebel Wilson is absolutely hilarious!! I hope she makes more movies soon!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Great movie really cute and shipping and receiving was a breeze. Thanks so much and I will make another purchase in the future.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Digging this backpack. I've had it about a month now. Only a few things I don't like about it, but considering the price, those are easy to live with. This has a lot of storage space, especially compared to the shoulder bag it is replacing. Its really more space than the typical amateur photographer like me can use. I only have a few lenses and this has space for my camera plus about 8 to 10 lenses. (But its given me an excuse to think about some other lenses.) I've been carrying an extremely compact tripod around for a couple of years and the straps on the side are too large for it. I'm sure they would be fine for a typical compact tripod or standard tripod. The only other complaint is all the buckles and straps. They would probably be good if you were out hiking and wanted to really secure the backpack, but I'm carrying mine more around town. I wish the extra buckles could be more easily tucked out of the way.<br /><br />All in all though, a great product.
B00ARAO1LC|1.0|This was a stupid movie it was very disgusting movie ,one of the worst  movies i have ever seen , it depicts people that live in trailers are morons
