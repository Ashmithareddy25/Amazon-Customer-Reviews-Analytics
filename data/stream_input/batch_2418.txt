B004XQO90O|4.0|Duncan Jones's second movie is another assured and thoughtful SF thriller. Although not as philosophically weighty as Moon this is still an interesting piece, as long as you can suspend disbelief and forget all logic. It's moderately clever and always entertaining. Jones never allows things to spill over into the usual Hollywood blockbuster overkill, and the performances are also suitably controlled and utterly convincing. This is a 90 minute thrill ride with a surprisingly affecting emotional subtext, and it's made all the better by the subtlety and restraint shown by all involved.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I think that this is a good game to keep your kids occupied ion car rides and when you are makeing some sort of meal or craft and you don't shan't them to bother you!!!

B00364K6YW|5.0|This version of Pride and Prejudice is the best I've seen.  There is much more character developement in this version than others I've seen.  I sent a copy to a friend as well.  I hightly recommend this!
1936608898|5.0|I do recommend reading the book, then do the whole 30 with the help of their daily news letter. It cost an additional $15, but definitely worth the encouragement and extra knowledge.
B008M0NDOK|4.0|It feels great in my hands the stand was a little unstable with my iPad but for my iPad mini it was perfect the main problem is there are only 8 compatible apps and only gameloft games work with it unfortunate but hopefully they add more to the compatible list
B002G1YPH0|2.0|I bought this cooler because everything I had read told me that it was going to be quiet. Intel stock cooling that comes with their i5 products is already quiet, but I figured I could benefit from some additional quietness since I do voice work near my computer.<br /><br />However, this fan has proven to be extraordinarily loud. Intel stock cooling was barely audible but I can hear this cooler from 20 feet away.<br /><br />It handles heat well, but do NOT buy it for its silence. The constant whining hum will annoy you to no end. As for mine, it's back to Cooler Master with it!

B00AREIAI8|3.0|Fun game. Kind of wish there were more to do while waiting for energy. It would also be nice to have more mini games, but still a good app!
B008220C56|4.0|Setting Anna Karenina in a revolving door of set changes inside a dusty old theater was actually a rather brilliant idea. It opened up a lot of the heart of the story by either brutally confining the characters to the bondage of the stage of society or quite literally opening up the back door to let certain people escape to their own freedoms, however brief they may be. Metaphors aside, watching the filming and orchestration of this style of storytelling was absolutely a dazzling treat! Although I did find Anna a rather unlikable character, I most certainly understood her. So to that end, I managed to escape disliking the movie. Her motives were wild and impetuous; she rarely acted like anything other than a spoiled child. Yet I think that may have been a point of the plot, to let the audience see how love, passion, and greed for both of these emotions spoils people like fruit left out too long. I must point out the brilliance of casting Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Count Vronsky! The entire first hour of the movie completely captivated me as I watched the delicate dance between Keira Knightley and himself. I almost felt as if I was being overwhelmingly wooed by the man. Olivia Williams, who portrayed Vronsky's domineering mother, was also delightful! She is one of those British actresses who is absolutely sumptuous to watch on-screen. All in all I very much enjoyed this adaptation of Anna Karenina. Another superb period piece from Kiera Knightley!
1423140591|1.0|This book has entirely the same plot line as the first book in his other series. The character names were just switched.Not recommended if you read the other earlier series.
B008220D7S|3.0|So this is 40, huh? Well, how delightful does it look as portrayed by two such charming actors as Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann. Their chemistry is striking and the humor between them is fantastic to watch. The movie, on the other hand, definitely had its fair share of faults. The first of these is the exorbitant run-time! The beginning was great and I definitely enjoyed the last forty minutes or so, but the middle was extremely clunky and it definitely lost me more than a few times. Judd Apatow desperately needed to trim some of the fat from this comedy. At times I felt strong echoes of another movie, 'Crazy Stupid Love' and I felt that movie had a much more deft hand when it came to getting the point across about two middle aged people who begin to get too comfortable with one another. The plot needed to breathe a few times. Someone was trying way too hard to put this story in the mold of something else and it wasn't fitting properly. That being said, This Is 40 is a charming little film. The two girls who play their daughters are hysterical! I got more than enough laughs from the two of them! Megan Fox is certainly a scene-stealer as well, but I would delightfully watch her in anything. This movie almost wins my 'rewatchability' rating, but I really couldn't stand another two and half hours of it.
B002S9DRA6|5.0|Platinum Collection is a 3 CD compilation album that was released in 2009 and is a mix of new age and ambient. The first CD contains all the hits, the second CD remixes and the last CD contains 11 unreleased tracks. Truly a must have for fans of Enigma and for fans of new age and ambient music. Highly recommended. 5/5.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Peter Jackson has done it again! He brought the fantasy world of Middle Earth to the big screen in a vibrant, and exciting way that stays true to Tolkien's story, while bringing in the elements of what else was going on in Middle Earth at the time. The breath-taking scenery of the New Zealand landscape IS Middle Earth, and Martin Freeman is perfect as the younger Bilbo.
0375851569|4.0|Purchased this set for my niece who loves Cat In the Hat.  I'm a big fan of Dr. Seuss.  The only reason I didn't rate this a 5 is because one of the books had the cover glued on slightly crooked.

B007HC3LHS|5.0|I read this book a while back. I think it was free at the time. I see now that the price is almost $8.00. I felt compelled to write a review because it is totally worth it! This book is amazing. The story is unique and well written. You get sucked in and it's impossible to put it down. I felt every emotion that the mc felt. I wanted to know what exactly happened to her. The author does an excellent job of moving from present to past and back again. It was never confusing or boring.
B00BEZTMWW|1.0|While i knew the film was long and probably was going to be a slow development, the big issue was that the 3D version was really blurry on my LG 3D TV. It actually gave us a headache trying to watch it and so we switched to the blue ray version

6305433909|4.0|This is a movie that makes a great escape and warms the heart. While not as complex a plot as the original Sister Act, it is nevertheless inspiring, and a good message that remains timeless despite the moving being released in 1993. - Author Claudia Newcorn

B00004Z4SD|5.0|Great story of the strength of the human spirit. The story shared in the Bar scene is moving. Makes me wondered why we work so hard at hiding our own life's pains, even when doing so is so destructive, sometime leading to our own demise. I would definitely recommend this film, especially for the emotionally literate.
B009AMANBA|5.0|What a great movie about a great president. There was so much tragedy in Lincoln's life, both personally and politically, but he managed to pull himself and this country together with wit, wisdom and strength. I think this movie did a fine job of showing all of his strengths, and his weaknesses. If you're a history buff and/or and admirer of Abraham Lincoln, this movie is for you.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I would reccommend this to anyone that wants a safe video game for their kid or grandkids. The only problem is both of my local grandkids fight over it.
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|The special effects and imagery are incredible in this movie, as would be expected.  If you are a fan of the book, there are some differences, but it is a great adaptation in my opinion.  This will be a movie we watch every couple of months.

B009AMANBA|3.0|I thought that this movie was a great hiistory lesson. I also thought Daniel Day Lewis, delivered a brilliant and true-to-life Abraham Lincoln. .<br /><br />When I bought this movie, I expected to see more of Lincolns adroit and political astuteness, which would had included more than just the 13th Amendment - although I recognize that the passage of this amendment has to have been the defining moment of his presidency<br />I issued a rating of three stars because thought the entertainment value of this movie was very low in spite of the historical accuracy and brilliant charactrizations by all of the actors in the film.  Even with the great body of work, delivered by the cast, I found myself nodding off several times during the run of the film.

B0062NAVXA|5.0|What an amazing movie. It was a blessing that I saw that movie. Really opened my eyes. Thank you for this movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have tried to explain my feelings 5 times now only to come up short. I have one sentence then am unable to follow up with anything else. I have never connected with a story the way I have with this one (mainly because I don't read much. I am truly thankful to Suzanne Collins for writing this for the world.
B006HGXGWU|2.0|Take Shelter is about a small town Ohio man who strongly believes something bad is going to happen to him.  He spends all his time hallucinating the most horrific events will occur at any given moment such as tornadoes heading for his home, birds circling in the sky indicating impending doom, loud crashes of thunder and lightning that only he can hear but not his workmates, strangers standing in the rain outside his home preparing to break in, furniture unexplainably lifting from his living room floor, etc.  The problem is... I just named all the good moments.  Besides this, the rest of the movie is extremely tedious to watch due to being incredibly boring.<br /><br />Even his wife is a typical midtown-type lady who really serves no purpose as far as storyline development goes- she's only there so we can have more characters besides a hallucinating freak of a husband/father.  I seriously don't even think those who suffer from worrying constantly about potential serious danger would find Take Shelter interesting either- it does nothing to help people who suffer from these conditions.  It's too bland to really accomplish anything for *any* type of movie watcher.  I also seriously question whether Ohio's lands are as flat as portrayed in this movie, allowing tornadoes to be more frequent.  Maybe portions of the western half of the state.<br /><br />The man spends all his time either building his meaningless shelter in the back yard (without his wifes consent, heh) or talking to psychiatrists/taking medication for his lack of sleep/hallucinations.  I seriously can't remember a movie that felt so uninspiring and worthless to watch.  Over two *hours* of this stuff, too.  I feel like a total fool for watching it.  I feel foolish for believing the movie description was suspenseful and focused on tornadoes or a heavy atmosphere pertaining to storm activity- not really.  Oh and was the ending supposed to justify the 2 hours of boredom we had to persevere?  Give me a break.  Astoryline that practically defines uninteresting- that's what Take Shelter is about.

0553801473|3.0|'A Dance with Dragons' is the fifth novel in George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series. I haven't included any spoilers about 'Dance' in this review, but it is impossible to discuss the book without revealing events from the first four. So if you haven't read [[ASIN:0553386794 A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1)]] (1996) and its sequels, go ahead and get yourself caught up. I'll wait.<br /><br />Okay, now that we're all on the same page (literally), you're probably a little unsatisfied by [[ASIN:0553582038 A Feast for Crows (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 4)]] (2005). After all, as Martin writes in the afterword, \\"Wait a minute, wait a minute! Where's Dany and the dragons? Where's Tyrion? We hardly saw Jon Snow. That can't be all of it...\\" Fortunately, that is correct. The story Martin set out to tell in 'Feast' was too big to fit in just one book, so he divided it into two. 'Dance' tells the rest of the story, although like all of the other books in the series, it ends with more loose ends than knots.<br /><br />In 'Dance,' the game of thrones is far from over, and it has become clear that the game is not worth winning (though losing is much worse). Only one of the original claimants in the \\"War of Five Kings\\" still lives, but new contenders keep popping up. The fight for control of Westeros has become a world war, with new fronts opening up north of the Wall and across the Narrow Sea.<br /><br />Martin's great strength is his ability to flesh out all of his characters by regularly shifting point of view. Cersei Lannister, in particular, begins the saga as a calculating ice queen, but is startlingly human in 'Feast' and 'Dance.' Like the real world, Westeros contains no heroes or villains, just people whose mistakes cause unintended suffering.<br /><br />This review originally appeared in Pop Mythology.<br /><br />Matt Hlinak<br />Author of [[ASIN:0615700217 DoG]]
B000GYI32M|5.0|The show is awesome, and I'd been trying to get the full series just by picking around at stores like Plato's Closet, but I gave up and bought it new. Fast shipping and came packaged fine.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think this book is very funny and the first time I had read this book the more I loved it.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Firstly, WOW. It started out slow for me, but delivered its lesson. What a philosophical protagonist! I love Enzo! This complete story teaches its reader to never give up, and to never lose sight of what the heart truly wants. It shows that loyalty, and someone who never stops believing in us can bring us to the successes we desire, and the dreams for which we are destined. I love this book, I love the story, and I totally recommend it for readers who love dogs, who love philosophical teachings, and especially for those who never stop believing/who need that gentle shove that puts you back on track.<br />Thank you Enzo, and Thank you Garth Stein.
B00022M518|5.0|I stumbled onto \\"Warm Jets\\" this past weekend via Youtube. To think it took me only 39 years to \\"discover\\" this sonic jewel! Oh well, better late than never, no? I just ordered this remastered CD version and am excitedly awaiting it's arrival. I'm floored, absolutley floored. Who knew that such a strange concoction even existed? I was out of the loop. Every track kills me in a good way; a purification of sorts.<br />My sense of hearing is forever changed.<br /><br />Regarding the extreme six string shredding on \\"Baby's On Fire\\": I've read where both Fripp & Rudolph admit to the off the wall soloing on this track. Some guitar heads claim to hear the styles of both players at work here. My own limited ear cannot tell. I'm guessing that Eno's wacked out treatments make it that much harder to say who's playing what. Regardless; enjoy!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Fitting end to a great series, I have loved this series since it first started many years ago. Many thanks to Mrs. Jordan in getting Mr. Sanderson to assist in finishing putting Mr Jordan's final thoughts into word's and finishing an incredible journey for those of us who love this world and this adventure. Loved this book.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|I have always liked Bos Scaggs, but never bought one of his albums. This is an excellent album from a legendary blues man. This is a great addition to my music collection.
B008G59IKO|2.0|The second in a trilogy of albums, following the groundbreaking albums of American idiot and 21st Century Breakdown. Uno was passable, but Dos is an almost total misfire and pretty much dispelled the hopes of greatness from the new trilogy. American Idiot defined the previous decade and to my mind is the definitive rock response to our new state of perpetual war, at least for that decade. In that context, Dos is a sad offering, full of sound and fury but signifying nothing. It sure as hell doesn't say anything about the current times, or anything else really. The immaturity thematically is actually embarrassing. These guys are now in their forties, and they churned out a song titled f** time. \\"I'm a beggar, but I don't want a dime, oh baby baby it's f*** time.\\" Are you kidding me? Awful.<br /><br />There are a few good tracks, (Stop When the Red Lights Flash, Stray Heart, Amy) but as a cohesive album, this falls far short of the mark. Maybe next time around they'll be ready to try something new musically and have something to say beyond pretending to be juvenile delinquents again. If anyone want that sort of stuff from them, we could just play Dookie or Kerplunk again.<br /><br />To end on a positive note, I will say that the third in the trilogy is the strongest of the three in my opinion, with catchier songs and the only lyrically mature songs of the three.

B007BVOEPI|5.0|This is well written and well executed series that had me hooked from the second episode. The episodes move so fast that character development falls just a little bit short, however, oh the plots, the twists, the drama! One of the best series of television!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|You think its easy at first, but it gets harder and harder as you go along.  I loved it playing it for the first time.
B009MYARIK|2.0|Kinsella's strength has always been to take one strong female character and tell the story in that person's voice. This format, tossing the narrative back and forth between two very different sisters, just didn't work for her. Both sisters end up as two dimensional characters, neither one believable or particularly likeable. The male characters fare no better -- many adjectives, little depth. I started this yesterday morning and found myself beginning to skim about halfway through. It was just so formulaic that I wanted it to be over already. I expect all but the most diehard fans will feel somewhat let down.<br /><br />I myself will be waiting for another book with a shopaholic, an undomestic goddess, or any other character who has a charming adventure, but feels like a real woman. Sorry Sophie, not this time.

038533348X|3.0|Kurt Vonnegut has written a number of books that capture the imagination; Cat's Cradle is not one of them.  The story is about a man who sets out to write a book on the events of the day the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and in particular the life of the \\"father\\" of the bomb, Dr. Felix Hoenikker. Along the way he meets a variety of people. The first 100 pages or so are not very interesting. The story gathers interest when the storyteller arrives on the island of San Lorenzo where he meets the three children of the now deceased doctor and discovers a religion called \\"Bokonon\\" which is named after a person by that name. Things get interesting when the storyteller is chosen as the new king of the island, thus allowing him to marry the king's beautiful daughter,Mona. There are some humorous parts here such as when the storyteller tells Mona that she must be faithful to him after there marriage but she replies that her religion (Bokononism) says she must love everyone.  The story comes to a climax when another invention of the doctor, ice-nine which freezes everything it touches gets loose and destroys everyone and everything. Ice-nine of course represents nuclear annihilation or in more modern terms environmental destruction.  The book is also a heavy-handed satire on religion.  But the ending makes no sense and we are left with no hope.<br /><br />The title refers to the child's game by that name in which one uses one's hands to make a make-believe cat's cradle. But as one of the characters says, it is just fake:  \\"There is no cat; There is no cradle.\\" Vonnegut seems to be saying that major institutions are fake in the same way.  If you have not read any of Vonnegut's works I suggest that you start with a different one. If you have read some of his other books you may well enjoy this one.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|game is larger than my screen on my android. Would like for the game to fit the screen, so that i can play.
B00BMEF6IO|5.0|You really can't expect more from a band that never disappoints. BMTH grows and expands their sound and power with each album, and this is no exception. Dynamic, ethereal, and truly amazing... Plus they'll still rip your face off. This group is really maturing and coming into their own sound without abandoning their roots. Every song is worth the 5 star rating.<br /><br />PS: purchasing the special edition with the extra tracks is worth it. I would've regretted not having those additional songs, they're some of my favorite.
B00650SSDU|5.0|Very fun movie, although I still don't find JT to be terribly manly...a little too metrosexual for me!  Loved the light story.

B004ZIHYXO|5.0|Having grown up in Miami, hip hop, rap and bass have always been part of my listening library. South Florida has produced many great writers and artists in these musis genres - Pitbull is up there with the best of them. Great Miami and Latino style. Lyics and rhymes and beat are excellent. Great for working out or just bobbing your head and rapping along.
1594830835|4.0|I listened to this book on audio.  But I listened to the 2nd book in the series before this, so I HAD to go back and get the first one.  I totally enjoyed the characters Baldacci has created in his Camel Club group.  They are unlikely friends, and even unlikelier to save the world, but that is what they keep doing.<br /><br />This particular book is great fun.  It builds and builds to an event you know is coming, but when it finally happens it is not at all what you expect it to be.  Villians are not black and white villians and the world issues this book points out are very real.  The bad guy you expect all along is not as bad as you think and some of the good guys almost destroy everything.  Very much like real life, we all have shades of grey inside us as do Baldacci's characters.  If you like a thriller, this is a great book for you.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I have a problem with the time. It makes me nerves. I have to learn to disregard it. Otherwise I like it!
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|Not all that romantic, not all that surprising, rather contrived.  It kept my interest long enough to finish, but I've read better.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I always thought that Cut the rope original was awesome. But I was wrong cut the rope time travel is even better. I personally like the portals. This game is awesome you should try it.
B007SGM084|5.0|The hype is totally real!!!  Read these books, you won't be sorry... my man had the hottest sex of his life when I was reading these!!! :-)
B00884GR0W|5.0|Too bad it's not free anymore because of the update,but I got it early for free (smilely face). Bad freaking butt,man(in the good way)but I think the graphics are a bit TOO good. When I ventured fearlessly in a cave,I nearly came out screaming my  butt off in real life. I have arachnaphobia,so when I ran into THE MOST REALISTIC LOOKING FREAKING GIANT SPIDER I NEARLY HAD A HEART ATTACK. Actually TWO of them. And it gets even WORSE. They made a boss called Aragog,or as I like to call,The ButtWhoop of buttwhoops (spiders). But I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE it otherwise. You can also use something called fly speed,which makes it  a lot easier to get to floating<br />Islands. GET IT BEFORE PRICES GO UP AGAIN.
0375831002|5.0|I was very unsure about this book. My wife and a few friends had always raved about this book but I wasn't sure it was for me. Eventually curiosity got the better of me and I gave it a shot. I am glad I did, I couldn't say this was one of my favorite books but it deserves the five stars I gave it. The biggest reason this book earned five stars for me was for the simple fact that I don't like Historical fiction.<br /><br />This book was different, the characters are so well written most of the background stuff melted away and I cared about the characters. It didn't matter if this was set in Nazi Germany, or if the story was tweaked to fit into today's settings. The characters were what kept me going because I wanted to know what happened next.<br /><br />For most of the book I enjoyed it but was not impressed until the very end. The story centers on a girl who has been adopted and lives in Nazi Germany during World War 2. She is learning to read and the books she finds are changing the way she looks at the world. As she grows in her ability and we the reader get to see her in her daily life, I began to feel for her, and wish her life would get just a little bit better. The people that come into her life are well developed and full of life in the literary sense. One of the things that peaked my interest early on was the narrator. As the book opens we get to meet the main characters and of course one of them is out narrator. This is none other than Death himself. It was thrilling to see the lives of these characters through Death's eyes.<br /><br />There is not much I really have to say about this book other than I did really enjoy it and I am so glad I read it. I highly recommend this book to anyone just looking for a good story.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love anything &amp; everything that has to do with Jurassic park. I grew up on watching all the movies. This game is WAY better than Framville
B003XYE7R2|5.0|This is one of my favorite Sherlock Holmes stories. It is full of suspense, intrigue, and action. I have enjoyed every one of Conan Doyle's Holmes stories, but like anything else I have my favorites.<br /><br />For its time I can completely agree that this had to be one of the most terrifying books written. In today's environment where we all seem to be desensitized to a classic ghost story one might not enjoy this if they are expecting to have to sleep with the light on. Still, it has a great deal of thrills that had me on the edge of my seat. In this book Sherlock is called upon to investigate the strange death of Sir Charles Baskerville. The death is blamed on a family curse claiming a giant hell hound is the attacker. Busy with another case Sherlock sends Watson on ahead of him to begin gathering information. I really liked this aspect of the story. It was nice to see Watson shine for a bit instead of being complimented and then criticized by Holmes for every decision he makes.<br /><br />This is certainly a classic and one I know I will read over and over again. Some parts of the story were a bit predictable, but it was still very enjoyable. I highly recommend this to any reader; I feel it should be one everyone reads at some point in their lives. For those who are fans of classic novels, or mystery, I would wonder why you haven't read this already.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Brest book ever!!!<br />Ammmaaaazing I loved it so much just can't wait for house of Hades<br />I loved it so much
B004WR125O|5.0|As advertised.  Does the job fine and boosts the usefulness of your reciever.  I recommend if you need this capability.
1439181780|5.0|Very Helpful information, I would refer this book to my family and friends if they want to purchase a very helpful book for the their life.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|My wife and I have both had NDE's . . . Not to this level.  This book by Dr. Alexander helps put Life into prospective.  I wonder what happens to people who are evil?
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder is the best book I have read it would make you laugh cry and change your life forever if you saw a disable person before you read this book you would make a face but after you read it you would be kind and not make a face that's why I t think that this is the best book I have read and its going to be ours
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is a wonderful jigsaw puzzle app. I have purchased many of the puzzle packs that go along with the game. Simple to use, with no serious issues.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Anthony has written a compelling amd interest epic saga. The hero has light elements of an antihero and the world building is rather interesting. The strength of brotherhood is a powerful theme.
B004H6G0TI|4.0|This is a fun game. You fly your plane by using the joystick type control at the bottom left of the screen and try shooting using the fire button on the bottom right of the screen. Simple controls. You shoot the planes down that show up and the level progresses in difficulty. There are stars that fall from the sky and they have rewards or not. Sometimes it will freeze your enemies or sometimes it makes you fly slowly. Each star has either a benefit or a curse that only lasts a little while. Fun game.
B0050KEVO6|4.0|Some combinations are easy and others are hard. Some are just so obvious that I have over looked them. Now that my wife is playing, and catching up, we'll be comparing notes to find what elements she hits and ones I have but she doesn't.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is a really enjoyable game. The object is to try to get your jetpack wearing fellow to the farthest distance. There are missions to complete along the way. There are vehicles that you are able to find during levels that are fun to use as well. T
B005H8DEMG|4.0|Good movie. I watched this for a class. When I got back to reading and studying for the test it was difficult for me to get back into thinking of a male Prospero rather than a female Prospera. Mirren was very convincing. The effects in the movie were spectacular.
B008D28HYS|5.0|This is a challenging game. I enjoy making the pictures with the clues that are given. It progresses in difficulty, starting from easy to very hard. I like the color version of this game over the black & white version. I feel it gives it more dimension, sometimes making the game more difficult as well. Great game for logic solvers.
B003O5MO2A|5.0|This album is definitely a piece of indescribable thunder. There is so much happening between the musical interaction of the band members that one gets the feeling they are all 'soloing'. But, as they say, 'the whole' is greater than 'the sum of the parts'! Exciting! Live music has always been the real 'test' of a band's dynamic for me, and Blue Oyster Cult prove on this disc that they were the 'real thing'! Although it may sound 'straight-forward', 'On Your Hands or On Your Knees', is a strange live album that in no way disappoints! An album for those who only admire 'real musicians'! Nothing fake here!
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|This is a simple version of a jigsaw puzzle that is very entertaining. The levels progress with difficulty, ending with the challenge. The challenge consists of a timed marathon of the puzzles you just completed. This is a simple but fun puzzle game.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|This film was quite different from what I expected.  And I liked it even more than I thought I would.  The people were interesting and their problems and solutions were as well.  I felt they did a great job of covering the topic and made it very rewarding to watch.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I did not think I would enjoy this game, however, I have truly enjoyed the challenges that the game has. You find shells which give you missions to complete, your shark grows as you play the levels by eating things. Eventually, you get the chance to purchase (with coins you earn!!!) a different species of shark and the challenge starts again. You have the option to purchase more coins or gems, but I have found that this is one of the rare games that you can earn the coins and gems fairly easily. This is a wonderful game and am so glad I gave it a chance!
B0053TMP24|4.0|Another excellent story by Riordan. I truly enjoyed the main character pairing in this one, just as I did in its predecessor, but Son of Neptune rises above The Lost Hero simply because of the backstories Riordan has crafted for Frank and Hazel. Brilliantly done.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have enjoyed this version of facebook with no issues. I am able to do everything I would do on my computer with this app except changing my cover photo. I can share, like, and comment. Recommend.
0062238868|5.0|I bought this book after learning about Kyle's story. A totally terrific read and one that really got to me since I knew of his untimely death. This man defended so much and dedicated his life to the USA knowing full well the ramifications to himself and family. One of the great patriot books.
B000W965QW|5.0|I have enjoyed a few other Hornby novels but figured this one may feel dated, especially since I had seen the film 12 years ago, and even then it was a dated story. But we booked a vacation (er, holiday) in London and I wanted to get in the right frame of mind. Now I wish the film was set there and not Chicago, another great town but not where it should have been in my opinion.<br /><br />In the end I loved that it took place in another era. The flashbacks to life with vinyl albums, mix tapes and answering machines. That's how I grew up and it was fun to remember daily life. I especially enjoyed the concept that making a tape for someone is meaningful and each song (as well as the order of each) matters. And listening to an old favorite album back to back can definitely be cathartic and/or therapeutic.<br /><br />Hornby, as usual, does not preach ideals or clobber you with an agenda, just hilarious everyday observations about people and relationships. I especially loved the description of the slow real seduction, which includes small talk, misunderstandings and that awkward moment where you know you will be sleeping together, so each takes a turn in the bathroom...<br /><br />The book does get deeper at times, dealing with insecurity, breakups, death and marriage. But it never gets bogged down and always keeps true to its lighthearted and humorous self.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|One of Dan Brown really great books. I loved the action and it was really hard to put down. A great sequel to Da Vinci Code and Demons and Angels.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|this is a fun game. it is pretty easy but you have to stay on your toes. I like the flame round the best because you can get a lot of points.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|I don't like this app because it does not work with Adobe. I downloaded this app to be able to watch videos but instead doesn't work at all.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I don't use it for anything more than an alarm clock but it's great! I love that I can set multiple alarms and that the alarm starts quietly and then builds.
B004UHL9EK|1.0|I could not figure out how to just set an alarm one day as a reminder.  It appears to only apply to 5 days repeat setting, which I do not need.
1616550414|5.0|I bought this for my girlfriend two months ago and she loved it, of course she is a zelda fan, but this book is full of drawings and some tips about the origin of the characters... Must buy
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Can't stop playing this game! I play this game every chance I get. I downloaded this game on my phone as well. I try to get everyone to try it out.
0307949486|4.0|A really good story of mystery and intrigue, but excruciatingly long-winded. I enjoy back story, getting to know where the characters came from, what motivates them, and such, but I don't need to know every time they have to pee, or what ingredients they put on their sandwich for lunch. Even so, this is a carefully crafted story with plenty of detail (plenty) on how things play out. The characters are likeable, even Salander, who one would likely take an instant disliking to upon meeting her on the street. I'm sure I'll read the follow-ons, 'The Girl Who Played with Fire' and 'The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,' but I'll have to read a few things of less epic proportions first.
0307476464|4.0|I felt this was a great book but more than a little too long, the first part particularly didn't need so much attention to detail. Call me a wimp but a 900 page sci-fi novel seems more than excessive. If you sold it as a 3 part trilogy no one would have bothered with part 2 after reading part 1. Is his goal to be the James Michener of Sc-fi?<br /><br />Enough with the length. It was a great story with very interesting characterization. If anyone is looking for suggestions on editing, there was just way too much graphic sex descriptions that at times got a little deviant. They contributed absolutely zero to the story. The only necessary sex scene, although again too graphic was the<br />***SPOILER*****<br /><br />impregnation of the female character<br /><br />I know someone is going to accuse me of being an idiot for complaining about page count. What I will say is that even though he's a promising writer I will not commit to the time to get through any more of his stuff.
B000SL1P9G|2.0|The description of the movie did not say it was in Italian. We are keeping it for the entertainment factor!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I bought this book about a year ago and I have enjoyed reading it several times over. There are a few spelling errors and such, but it was free. FIVE STARS!
B000JQUZCI|2.0|I have been curious to read this book for years.<br />It is written in a old fashioned style and quite moralistic.<br />The style of writing is interesting and I could see it would have created a stir in its time, but times have moved on.<br />I found that I was only reading the book to say I had read it.
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|This soundtrack is magical. Moody with thoughtful electronic tones and keyboarding, its just sweet. A great soundtrack for anyone into scifi.
B00CAJP0ZO|5.0|Anyone who likes a philanthropist (did I spell that right?) should listen to this album. Will.I.Am is a gifted musician. This album is fun, uplifting, a little silly (especially Geekin' and Freshy), and inspiring. I listen to it on my daily work out and it gets me pumped and focused.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The movie is great, however, I haven't watched the extras yet. I recommend the movie for its quality and plot.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was a very quick read because I couldn't put it down. Abby and Travis had a magnetic attraction that yes was a bit roller coaster and unpredictable but they are young....and hello! Today's youth is so drama! Same as many adults.... Maybe we all get addicted to the adrenaline of the drama. So do not listen to the bad reviews unless you consider yourself VERY conservative and immune to a good love story! Buy it and enjoy!
B004TI5N38|3.0|I liked the story line (though the conclusion seemed a little rushed), and I liked the characters but my gosh, the author (Connely) had a crush on the Army!  It got so I was rolling my eyes every time the \\"A\\" word was written - which was like every other paragrah.  If you can get past that, the story is good and engaging.<br />*spoilers*<br />I did wish there was some closure on the brother though...maybe for a follow up book?
B005MLOOJA|5.0|If you enjoy snappy dialogue, entertaining plots, and decent actors this is the show for you. The guest stars are just as good as the series regulars which makes every show new and enjoyable.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I just finished and can't wait to start the next one! Catching fire had me hooked from the start and such a great ending. :)
0071771263|5.0|I am still preparing for the exam and this book is being very helpful, I hope I score good and get a scholarship.<br />Thank you guys.
B003WE9TU8|4.0|I never thought I would find myself reading a book about zombies but this book is so much more.<br />It's personal and in your face raw human emotions and I really love the contrasting cultures even if it was a little stereotypical. And the zombies were really more of a side story, it could have been any natural disaster and really can still be. It would take so little to tip us all into chaos and the way we live today, we are so incredibly ill-equipped to handle any kind of survival situation.<br />So, thank you Max Brooks for a great journey, I've really enjoyed the ride!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I wasn't expecting a lot, as I am more interested in ground based combat narratives, but this is one of the best books ever. I wish I had a quarter of the bravery, chivalry, and heroism these men possessed.
B0060FXBNM|1.0|Boo! The description page is so confusing. Some reviews says it has extra features others say it doesn't. It does give extra feature listings for the first movie. It's very vague. If you're looking for extra features I don't think this is for you.
0375869026|5.0|I'm reading Wonder aloud to my fifth grade class. They LOVE it.  It's so good for class discussions of kindness, empathy, bullying, and how to relate to someone who's different in some way.  It's the perfect story to think about before they go off to middle school.  I hope it helps them all be kinder, as well as the confidence to stand up to bullying to themselves and others.
B000ME5B30|5.0|Factual, well presented, and very good to share with friends who aren't generally open to this type of film. A must have!!
B00C2VIA52|4.0|I have played The RPG of this game, and have played Magic the Gathering online. And saw this game and thought I would try it, and I love it. It's a combo of both games. If you like either games I highly suggest at least trying it. You will spend at least 2hours straight on it once you get it before you realize how long you have been playing. Another good thing about it is during the tutorial if you want to skip the talking you can just hit the double arrows at the top right. Makes it easier to keep the game play going. The downfall is you can't delete profiles once you have made them. And also it don't tell you what characters have what powers...Ex (Humans, Elf, Orcs, Undead). Other than that it's a great fun strategy card game. I actually rate it a 4.5. If you need a friend look me up on there ( Demionik) or add me on Facebook either by my name (Paul Kingery) or by my email (Pkingery@gmail.com) Good luck!
1439190275|5.0|This is Alice.  I ordered the book & it's a great reference when on the diet & you have questions.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|In short, I loved this book. Won't go on and on about the details of the story other than to say I immediately downloaded William Landay's other books and have high expectations.<br /><br />I had heard this book had a surprise ending and I'm always a bit skeptical when I hear this prior to reading as it tends to make me focus on figuring out what the plot twist will be and when it will happen. The good news, the story didn't disappoint because there were several and each one had caught me off guard.<br /><br />Enjoy the book.
B00013BN4S|5.0|Love Emmylou.  Have since the 60's - so happy to strart a new collection of her music on CD's.  Great price for a new CD.
B000FC2PKG|5.0|This is the 3rd dd warren book I have read. Yes all outta order but I loved them all so much I am now working on reading them in order. Lisa Gardner is brilliant! Everyone of her books has had me glued from the beginning.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|It holds your interest without trying to bury you in industry jargon.  For such an educated person to speak at such a comforting level it to make advanced theory possible to the novice.
B00127RAJY|5.0|When you can't get yourself to a gym, this DVD is a great workout. Don't forget to get a mat and weights, though, if you don't already have them.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|awesome game. best game I ever played in my life the dogs are so cute they they remind me of my dog. I love this app so much I think the kreaters did a really good job
B0013N4AT0|5.0|I love opeth! i think this may actually be my favorite album! it is great and i dont know why i did not have this awesomeness a lot sooner!
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|Ok, to tell you the truth,this game stinks! Minecraft is way better and is so worth the money! Maybe if<br /> you didn't only get 5 minutes to play, it would be decent...but its not like that...so its horrible. DONT GET IT!!!!!!!
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|&#34;Lincoln&#34; really should have born a different title such as &#34;Ending Slavery&#34; or somesuch, because what this film is really about is Abraham Lincoln's courageous decision to push for the ratification of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, which of course outlaws slavery. This was undoubtedly one of Lincoln's great achievements and is the worthy subject of a fine film such as this one. Just understand that this film is about only a very narrow period of time in Lincoln's life, or even his presidency, and in fact takes place after victory in the Civil War is in sight.<br /><br />This film does an excellent job reminding the viewer that the decision to outlaw slavery by amending the Constitution was by no means an easy, or even popular, position for President Lincoln to take. In fact it required him to use every bit of his political capital and involved the risk of a resounding defeat to a President that had already suffered many defeats. In this period slavery had been a terrible fact of American life for a very long time and many of Lincoln's Civil War allies were adamant that the war was about preserving the Union, not about abolishing slavery. But as Lincoln had done many times before, he led the country in to doing what it had to do. This film makes this point very well.<br /><br />The acting in this film is uniformly good and this film is up to the usually high standards that Steven Spielberg usually attains in his films. Perhaps another film another time can deal with the broader subject of Lincoln's entire life and Presidency. In an understated way this film succeeds in reminding all of us that Lincoln was in fact a giant of his time and is well-deserving of his reputation as ranking with Washington as our greatest of presidents. RJB.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is really fun because there are two different modes. In Creative, you get to build anything. In Survival, you get to fight monsters and kill animals. Minecraft is also fun because you can join friends and play together. The only down side is that it when I go to sleep,  even though I'm not scared,  I always have nightmares. I HIGHLY reccomend this app to everyone. Just remember, it MIGHT give you nightmares.
B002GYS1FO|3.0|Not my genre of music, but my wife thinks it's great and that makes it great in my mind also!
B009IQG5LK|5.0|Loved it. Really saw a difference in blue ray compared to the original. One of my husband's favorite movies.He was glad to see it came on blue ray.
B008PWUWLC|3.0|Its attractive and hardy, but it doesn't stay standing...the case sags until it falls flat, which gets annoying after a while.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I am always open to supporting new artists. Especially ones as talented as little Ms Stirling here. I highly recommend that EVERYONE add this to their music collection immediately.
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|Since I haven't seen it, I can't really give an honest review at this time. I hope to watch it soon.
B008UZ7MUI|5.0|Movies were great, super fast shipping from Amazon & the price could not be beat. The 3D effects in part II were better by far than part I-more action I think helped a great deal.
B003ASLJMW|5.0|Love Clint Eastwood in everything I've seen him in.  Always good action and adventure.  Would recomend to anyone who likes Clint Eastwood and action and adventure
B009FZHYKU|5.0|AWESOME, CAN NOT WAIT FOR THE NEXT SEASON. USED AMAZON TO CATCH UP ON THE SERIES. THANKS EVER SO MUCH
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|Did not see this at the movies and could not wait to get it.  I have all the books and now the complete set of movies.  Very happy.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|Despite not being the first published, this book is a great introduction into the world of the drow and the mind of Drizzt. Perfect for people who love fantasy books and the forgotten realms. Salvatore perfectly crafts a world, race, and mindset. Great read.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Actually bought this as a gift for a friend who sings the whole show himself.  After seeing it at the movies, he was very happy to own a copy.
B009AMANH4|5.0|This movie is a bit long but keeps your attention, Daniel Day Lewis gives<br />a brilliant performance and I cant think of a better actress then Sally Field<br />as his wife. it kept my attention to the very end.
1932100385|5.0|This book will change the way you feel about food. It is a must read for anyone with children and who has cancer in the family. I will never look at nutrition the same way. Thank you Dr. Campbell for your years of  hard work!
B0060MYK7G|5.0|The Borgias is truly one of the greatest television shows I have watched and the second season cemented that.<br /><br />Stylistically, it is absolutely breathtaking in every manner.  The details paid to the costumes and sets are exquisitely rendered.  It feels as if every frame has been hand painted.  From the very first episode of the very first season, the audience is treated to a cinematic experience.<br /><br />Jeremy Irons, of course, brings the drama with his bombastic portrayal of the calculating, power-driven Rodrigo Borgia.  Francois Arnaud steals the show with his often sinister manipulations as the strategic Cesare Borgia.  Cesare is the trusted son who finds himself confined by the walls of the Vatican in his unwanted cardinal robes.  He is to be his father's eyes and ears at every turn, but Cesare may not be the best individual to handle interpersonal relationships (a violent streak, that one... not to mention his companion, Michelotto, a deadly assassin). The envy he holds for his bumbling older brother Juan's (the phenomenal David Oakes) position as leader of the papal army serves as a constant source of conflict.  It is a position Cesare will do anything to gain.  Juan is Rodrigo's favored child and is fully aware of this.  He is spoiled and pampered, this season finds him at a serious loss when he reaches one excruciating low after another and struggles to find his feet.  Holliday Grainger brings innocence, sensuality, and charm to the infamous figure of Lucrezia Borgia.  Lucrezia must constantly adapt to her familial position as a mere bargaining tool in her father's political games.  She escapes one abusive marriage to an affluent husband during the first season through an annulment only to find her newly found freedom threatened by a second political marriage.<br /><br />The Borgias is a show that focuses on an ambitious family and their struggle to essentially rule Italy.  It is thrilling and thought-provoking.  Some of the pacing and story threads can feel a bit rushed or even prodding at times, but the singular effect at the end of the season is that of completion.  I am currently watching the third season as it airs and it appears to be as equally magnificent at the second.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies.  The cast is amazing and the music is beautiful.  The actors really put out their best work.
B000SGGUWS|4.0|This is my guilty pleasure I love the tv show decided to start reading the books!  I have to say it is almost as chilling as watching the show.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I have played  numerous games that are hidden object and full of mini games...i am always bummed that there are too few mini games...this just one big mini game that will have you thinking for a few hours. Lots of fun and worth a couple of bucks. Two thumbs up!!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Book had a lot of interesting plots to it. Caught on 3/4 through story who the \\"culprit\\"might be but only because of Anne coming back  into the picture.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Lincoln makes me thankful that our country had such a wonderful person to lead us through a difficult time.  Abe Lincoln was a remarkable man.  I never fully appreciated him before watching the film.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|i bought this game and the next day i was hooked its great for wasting time and its not like other games that have in app purchases forcing you to buy to progress instead it just takes time to get stuff done great game buy it

B004SYP5WC|2.0|This app is very basic in that it produces a notification reminding you a bill is due.  I input several bills and got reminders on schedule for all of them.  However, I attempted to delete a couple reminders, one a mistake and one a paid-off student loan, and for some reason kept getting reminders for both every month.  It appeared that each time I deleted the unwanted reminder it only removed a single occurance and continued to generate new reminders each month.  Maybe I missed something, but there isn't much to this app, so I don't think so.  Not worth the frustration.

B00BRPH4EC|5.0|The last couple HIM albums (Venus Doom and Screamworks: Love in Theory and Practice) seemed to have a different style than the other HIM albums to me (more so with Venus Doom).  I am happy to say that after listening to the Tears On Tape, they have seemed to go back to their deeper, darker way of writing songs.  You can still hear the influence that Venus Doom and Screamworks have on this new album (some upbeat, catchier tempos and choruses) but you can also hear some parts that remind you of their old songs.  Overall I am not disappointed one bit with this album, and will be added to the complete collection of HIM albums I already have.<br /><br />To me the best way to listen to a HIM album, especially a new one, is to put on a nice pair of headphones so you can feel the bass, turn the lights down low, close your eyes, let Ville's baritone voice suck you in and make your own music video in your mind.<br /><br />EDIT:  Well after listening to this album over and over at my desk while working, I can say this seems to be a mix of styles from all their albums.<br /><br />Can definitely hear the Venus Doom sound right off the bat in \\"All Lips Go Blue\\". Razorblade Romance can be heard in \\"Tears On Tape\\".  Screamworks can be heard in \\"Into The Night\\", \\"Hearts At War\\" & \\"Dawn & Quartered\\".  Dark Light can be heard in \\"No Love\\". Greatest Love Songs Vol. 666 can be heard in \\"W.L.S.T.D.\\".<br /><br />Probably could go on about which albums sound like the songs come from but this is just what I thought of after a couple plays.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I got these headphones to replace an $17 pair i got with a giftcard! these things are amazing!

I love this headset and it was a great purchase!

The acting is superb in &#34;Sense & Sensibility&#34; and I appreciate that I can UNDERSTAND what they're saying through their British accents (I always use the available subtitles).

The graphics are great and its creepy fun.. it's another good one from G5..<br /><br />Note... it took about 9 hours before it fully down loaded. Patience is required.

B00CF0VGUG|4.0|For all of their fame and notoriety, The Stooges only released 3 proper studio albums before 2007.  These albums, THE STOOGES (1969), FUN HOUSE (1970), and RAW POWER (1973), are essential listening for any fans of punk rock.  Iggy Pop and the the rest of the band parted ways after RAW POWER, the band's masterpiece, and later reformed in 2007 with the lukewarm THE WEIRDNESS.  With this last album aside, it would be hard for anyone to meet the reputation of the Stooges -- the band and its notorious leader are known as much for their antics as they are for their music.  And while this outing it largely a reunion, the death of Ron Asheton (original lead guitar player on THE STOOGES and FUN HOUSE) has left a hole in the group -- his death in 2009 is unfortunate, and his presence is missed here.  Luckily, THE WEIRDNESS feels like a warm-up for READY TO DIE.  READY TO DIE is a solid album that doesn't quite live up to the pedigree that the band created for themselves in the 1970's, but it's as good as a fan can really hope for at this point.<br /><br />The first curious point here is the change in the band name -- the name READY TO DIE is released with -- is Iggy and the Stooges.  The only other time that this name was used a studio released was on 1973's RAW POWER (other releases are just \\"The Stooges\\").  In 1973, RAW POWER was written primarily by Iggy Pop and (guitarist) James Williamson, and this pattern is repeated here with Williamson handling production duties.  In ways, this is intended as a sequel to RAW POWER with an attempt to capture the same spirit that characterizes the band's reputation.  Call it age, call it maturity, call it experience, for any number of reasons, the frenetic energy that the Stooges once put to record seems to have vanished.  Sure some of these songs on READY TO DIE are fast(ish) or uptempo, but the vitality that made RAW POWER a masterpiece is largely gone and drained from the remaining members of the band.  Plenty of older recordings of the studio sound like the band is nearly about to derail into noise, but READY TO DIE sounds firmly on track -- never does the energy threaten to overwhelm the music.<br /><br />Much of Iggy's contribution here sounds like a creepy uncle rather than the out-of-control frontman we are familiar with.  There's less singing/thrashing about here than there is muttering and crooning, like some of Lou Reed's more recent work.  Most times on READY TO DIE, I'd say that it works fine.  There's no bursting-at-the-seams intensity like on \\"Search & Destroy\\", but he's able to deliver a serviceable performance for most of this album.  \\"DD's\\" gets a bit silly with Iggy's ode to large breasts.  The song comes across as weird and awkward rather than fun or sexy.<br /><br />But don't get me around, this album is mostly really good.  The intro track \\"Burn\\" features some of the frenetic guitarwork that James Williamson has made his wheelhouse.  \\"Sex and Money\\" is conceptually awful, but the band sells it with the right amount of sleaze and saxophone.  \\"Job\\" has an irresistible melody.  \\"Unfriendly World\\" is a slow, acoustic song that sounds part Stooges song and part demented lullaby.  If you buy the deluxe edition, the last track, \\"Dying Breed\\" leaves the album on a middling note -- it's far from the best song on the album, and it doesn't beg to be repeated (contrast that with if the album ended on one of the more upbeat tracks like \\"Burn.\\")  Or, if you buy the standard edition (and skip out on this extra track), the ballad to Ron Asheton, \\"The Departed\\" provides a completely sober, somber, serious note to end on.<br /><br />The album makes a detour towards its end: \\"Beat That Guy\\" and \\"The Departed\\" are more steady and downtempo than most of the band's output.  \\"Beat That Guy\\" is a sold track, though it doesn't sound much like a Stooges track with its acoustic guitar and wispy female backing vocals.  With that said, I liked the song just fine -- sure it's not what I would expect, butit's a good song nonetheless.  The next track, and penultimate song on the album \\"The Departed\\", begins with a tribute to Ron Asheton's classic \\"I Wanna Be Your Dog\\" guitar riff.  The rest of the song (a ballad) serves as a tribute to the band's fallen comrade.<br /><br />When THE WEIRDNESS was released, I was disappointed.  Part of this disappointment was due to it being a middling album, but mostly, I was upset that the band seemed to be going out on a low note.  Now, with READY TO DIE, if the band never releases another album, that will be just all right with me.  Sure, it's not essential, and it's not going to blow the doors off the barn, but it is a good effort that rekindles some of the same chemistry these members had way back when.  The energy, the rage, and the danger are all missing, but there's enough here to satisfy long-time fans.  If you're unfamiliar with the band, I would recommend checking out their earlier catalog before starting here as this is not the best place to begin listening.<br /><br />Notable tracks for sample/download: \\"Burn,\\" \\"Job,\\" and \\"Ready to Die.\\"it's a good song nonetheless.

B009LXEBD4|5.0|Great collection of Kelly's songs. The only one I considered a miss was the one with Vince Gill. Otherwise, a good album to have for a long drive.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|As well done as any WW2 aviation war movie I have ever seen and I have seen them all. Story line was accurate and photoshooting was absolutely right on on all air combat scenes. great acting by all, A real keeper for war movie libraries.<br />I have watched it 3 times already.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Very accurate on predictive text. My only complaint is there isn't an easy way to use words that aren't in the dictionary without adding them. I think that is a poor limitation to the program but I am glad it fixes the problems I had with the stock keyboard.
B00AZNEW5G|3.0|I found the first half of this movie to be confusing as to who was who and what part they had in the real life event. I also thought the movie could have explained why the Navy took this individual to sea to dispose of the body! for an action type important subject I don't think it was completely accurate in portraying the subject matter.
B00BF2RV22|5.0|Owned the laserdisc since '92, knew it was recorded in Sony HDTV.<br />So glad its available in all its glory.  Grammy winning performance.

B000002KAT|1.0|This album is difficult to listen to. I find it interesting that so many reviewers gave it five stars. Van Morrison has very much a whining \\"quality\\" to his singing that jars the nerves. His whining lyrics are effective on songs like \\"Brown Eyed Girl\\" but that is a different album. Astral Weeks is from start to finish a nerve-racking demonstration of annoying singing. It is no wonder that this album did not produce any hit songs (the album liner notes witness to this). I actually bought this CD album sometime in the early '90s and used to listen to it frequently as this was during a period of several months when I was out of work. (Therefore please don't tell me that I need to give it many listens before I can learn to appreciate it.) During that down-time it helped me to not think about my unemployment. I don't mean that the music was soothing -- it was anything but -- yet it gave me something else to worry about. I had been told by someone at the time of my unemployment that in order to not be tempted to feel sorry for myself I should visit a hospital's cancer ward and witness the suffering of patients with crippling, disabling illnesses. Believe me, listening to Astral Weeks was very much that kind of experience. Those days are long gone and now I am prospering. Astral Weeks is unhappy, miserable music and so it has to go.  I mean no offense to people who actually like this album, but in a few minutes I am going to shred it in an industrial strength shredder. Good bye, Astral Weeks.

B0066WJLU6|5.0|I really like this app. The light is very bright and comes in handy. When using it with the large screen it will work real well. I am happy with this app.
B009AMANH4|5.0|I loved this movie!  Daniel Day Lewis' performance was among the top 10 of all time.  I felt I was actually watching Lincoln, not just a film.  This should be a permanent  part of everyone's home video collection, to take out and enjoy periodically.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I normally don't give 5 stars...especially to 99 cent books. In this case I am making an exception for Andy Weir's &#34;The Martian&#34;. Great story line, great humor and a great main chracter. While being slightly unbelievable in just a few places, this kept my attention and intrest from page one, or I should say from 1% since my old Kindle doesn't have page numbers. I highly recommend this book and hope Mr. Wier writes many more! I will certainly buy his next book if there is one. A surprisingly good story.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great show, I am very excited for the next season to be released on Amazon Prime!  I have trouble with the streaming from time to time, but that has nothing to do with the show.

B00CAJP0ZO|1.0|I love 2NE1 but that song Gettin' Dumb is a dumb song for real... It sucks bad... Stop ruining 2NE1 and when their English language album comes out it better not be horrible or you will have the a whole lot of Blackjacks and YG Stans coming after you... This whole was a miss period.
B00BEOYPKW|5.0|To be honest, I was somewhat underwhelmed by Kurt Viles' last album, \\"Smoke Ring For My Halo\\".  There were a couple of songs that completely wowed me (\\"In My Time\\" and the title track) but I didn't care as much for the rest of it.  To my way of thinking, that album sounded like a talented guy finding his way musically who maybe wasn't there yet.  But based on what I saw as Vile's potential from those songs I liked so much, I decided to give his newest one \\"Wakin On A Pretty Daze\\" a try.<br /><br />I'm pretty much wowed by this one from start to finish.  It is without a doubt the best thing I have heard this year so far, and one of the more amazing records I've heard in a long time!<br /><br />This time Vile uses a full band sound throughout, and the lengthy tracks allow the songs to stretch out a bit.  And they stretch out into some pretty far-reaching places.<br /><br />The moods range from a dreamy meditation on love and responsibility (\\"Too Hard\\") to an uptempo driver brimming with confidence (\\"Was All Talk) to beautifully-constructed pop (\\"Snowflakes Are Dancing\\" and \\"Never Run Away\\") to steady, muscular psychedelia (\\"Girl Called Alex\\" and \\"Air Bud\\").  There are other goodies mixed in, like the lovely and languid nine-minutes-plus opening track \\"Wakin On A Pretty Day\\" and the capstone of the album, the lush ten-minute \\"Goldtone\\".<br /><br />Vile is ably assisted by his band, The Violators, over the course of the album.  He and his two compadres create some beautiful sounds, and there are lap steel contributions by guest contributor Farmer Dave Scher in \\"Girl Called Alex\\", \\"Too Hard\\" and \\"Pure Pain\\" that elevate those songs from \\"good\\" to \\"great\\".<br /><br />While there is lots of talk about Kurt Vile as a songwriter (and he is very good at that), attention should be paid to his skills as an arranger and musician.  There aren't many people around lately who do all those things all at once as well as does, and \\"Wakin On A Pretty Daze\\" showcases his considerable talent in astounding fashion.  Some people may find his ultra-relaxed vocal style to be an acquired taste, but once you listen to the way he uses it as an instrument in these songs, I believe you will be sold on it.  This album is a total package, and for me it's pure satisfaction.<br /><br />Check out the dreamy passages in \\"Pure Pain\\"...  most of the last several minutes of \\"Was All Talk\\"... the high atmospherics of \\"Snowflakes Are Dancing\\"... the instrumental entirety of \\"Too Hard\\"...  the four-and-a-half-minute mark in \\"Air Bud\\" when the music busts back in and then for the minute or so after that...  There really is so much ear candy on this record that it's hard to describe it adequately.<br /><br />\\"Sometimes when I get in my zone you'd think I was stoned but I never, as they say, touch the stuff.  I might be adrift, but I'm still alert, concentrate my hurt into a gold tone...  golden tones.\\"<br /><br />Those are the words of a young musician who is searching for the lost chord.  And it in some places on this record, I believe Kurt Vile finds it.  Listen to his work, and you will see what I mean.

B005OCHOZS|5.0|This book is one of the best I've read on running and life in general. This book is more than a book about running. It is a tale of hardship, sorrow, discovery, love, inner peace, triumph, defeat, joy, and reality. This book contains emotions and experiences of many wonderful people, most belonging to Scott Jurek. I left this book feeling inspired.<br /><br />If you choose to read this book, truly invest your time, you will not regret it. There are many gems of knowledge within this book that I have found and used in my life, my running, my diet. I hope you too will find what I found within this book. Enjoy. Peace.
0060574216|3.0|This is not an easy read mostly because you feel outraged with the personality of the author. He clearly is a shovinistic insensitive person, and I have a feeling he composed this book and his practice solely to keep his wife from divorcing him. I mean, if all men valued things more than people in their lives, where would we be? And yet, this is what he shamelessly states. But just ignore the ugly things he shares about himself, for exapmle how insensitive he was when his post birth wife rolling in pain irritated him by her complains. Still, surprisingly, he has some interesting stuff to tell you. Apart from the \\"revealing\\" fact that each person needs space and that criticism kills love, which is kind of obvious, he has some good stuff to offer. Some of the observations he does are really good, and helped me understand my partner. So keep reading, even while rolling your eyes.

No User input on puzzle picture requests. Elegant actress pictures?<br />  4. Puzzle tray does not contrast pieces for easy viewing.<br />  5. Did not find puzzle piece rotation during assembly of puzzle.<br />  6. Magic Puzzles should list HD support for basic game on app store sales icon.<br />  7. All add-ons should state add-on and requires magic puzzles basic or HD.<br /><br />FINALLY: I found this to be a very nice app for down times during appointments, camping, or travel e.t.c. I will recommend this app to everyone who asks. The app could be a lot better with some small changes. Thanks for reading this. &quot;Mist&quot;

B000FQIRXQ|5.0|I bought this for my 88 year old mom who is a major Dickens fan. She loved it. When i sat down to watch it with her I was not expecting to be so entertained but i ended up not wanting to turn it off. Daniel Radcliffe is perfectly cast and carries his weight early in the story. It is a moving tale which reinforces many valuable moral lessons on such topics as friendship love family. A friend borrowed it to show her 8 year old daughter who is a huge Harry potter fan. She is a somewhat spoiled only child. After the movie she went and kissed her mom. It seemed to open her eyes to how fortunate she is for having two parents that love her. That's the kind of powerful impact it has on the viewer  David Copperfield is such a pure and decent child who shows such remarkable resilience in the face of real life's cruelty. He has bright spots on his journey through various characters that he meets even though each one of them struggles with their own flaws. It all comes together so beautifully at the end. Maggie Smith's performance is another reason to buy this version. Actually all the characters were well cast and believable. Needless to say I highly recommend this version. It's also a great value for the money.

B000FCK65W|4.0|I had never read this book before, even though I had heard about it for years.<br />It's a lovely story of a young, poor girl growing up in Brooklyn at the turn of the last century.  It is not a fast moving book, yet the characterizations are wonderful.  Should be on the high school literature must read shelves.  Ms. Smith does a wonderful job of describing the time era and how children managed in the streets of New York.
1594484805|4.0|Daniel H. Pink makes the case that we need to upgrade our `operating system' from, as he calls it, Motivation 2.0 (our current default setting) to Motivation 3.0 to remain in step with our changing behavior and society.  Incidentally, back in the cave dwelling days of our ancestors, it was Motivation 1.0  He expounds on how we are `programmed' under each of these systems and the reasons we need to change.<br /><br />Pink includes the research of noted behavioral scientists in their respective domains of:  intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, reward systems and productivity/state of `flow'.<br /><br />I, personally, came away with a new attitude towards \\"if/then\\" rewards.  That is, \\"if you do this, then you get....\\"  Pink elaborates how this type of reward does not necessarily work in all situations, especially in the work environment we live in today; where there is less routine, assembly line tasks and more reliance on conceptual thinking to solve complex problems.
B003WO4UIE|5.0|This is a very good CD. I love Bryan Adams and so does my mom. Good listening, Thanks a bunch
B00B97SNJI|2.0|My biggest problem with &#34;Stories Don't End&#34; is that this album is just not that interesting. It's smooth folk rock, very much in the LA wheelhouse of '70s icons such as the Eagles and Jackson Browne (they thank JB in the credits so this is not a revelation), and it sounds overly bright.<br /><br />For some reason, I expected heading to Asheville to record would infuse some of the rough around the edges vibe of the vibrant folk and Americana scene there, but none of that sticks to the teflon coating that makes it hard to hold on and dig in.<br /><br />The lyrics, for me, are another big problem. Actually, a really big problem with such stuff as  &#34;Well, I may be white, but I don't like my people much. . .&#34; or &#34;All my mornings start with the alarm clock. . . .&#34; Sorry, but I cannot find much common ground here.<br /><br />This is a pleasant album, it has a few keepers, but what drove me to give it two stars over three was the reprise of Just Beneath the Surface. Once was enough for this song.<br /><br />Nothing against this band, but I could not find a way to make myself like this record. If you do, that's cool. But the fact is, stories do indeed end. So do reviews.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|What can you say a bout Whitney!  She was just the greatest. I love her music and alway will. Thanks!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|One of the great holiday literary works of all time.  A refreshing dose of Dickens always puts things in perspective...
B00AB55BS0|4.0|Sometimes scenes are too dark so that you can't see characters. Other than that beautiful scenery fjords and forests. Spectactular filming.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I fell into Firefly by accident and the only true way to be able to see the whole thing (regrettably short as its run was) is to buy the collection.  Worth the money.
B008EEB4TA|5.0|This album is fun and different. I love her voice and style. I'm going to buy her first album now!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Worth the buy for any fan of Firefly, wrapping up a lot of questions.  Of course there were a few things that Joss Whedon regretted doing in this show because of how the fanbase grew in later times, but those are spoilers and not going to be mentioned...!
B004SBQALA|5.0|.I love the movie very much and hope to see in the near future another movie with the remaining numbers of the charaters that we have not saw yet. It was action flick, and very exciting to me and a few others, please make another movie of this, I would be there in a hearbeat.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|After a few levels there isn't much building you can do to the fact that you can't build anything cuz you don't have any energy buildings.you might have tons of money but what's the use if you don't have the energy to build.so after awhile it gets old and you get tired of just collecting coins ,what's the point?you can't build without energy anyway the wind energy only gives you so much then you're stuck.
B0072GPPNC|5.0|Was a very touching story about a boy and his horse, and I truly enjoy it, I really did not the problems the horse went thru, but it was a emotional story.
B00BQHA06A|5.0|I've been listening to the album all day and can't get enough of it, the sound grabs you and the songs are well put together. I felt that each song was powerful in itself and no fillers. If you like HIM, I think you'll love the album. In my opinion, don't compare the albums saying such and such was better or whatever, if you love the band you'll love it too because they are sharing their hearts with us and changes through the years show that they're not scared to get out of the box without losing themselves. I've loved all of HIM's albums and they definitely seemed proud of it from interviews and I agree that they should be. My iPod is going to be stuck on repeat for a while haha. Rock on! <3
1616550414|5.0|Hyrule Historia is a wonderful book for any fan of the Zelda franchise. The hard cover, page thickness, and print quality are exceptionally well done. The golden foil Gate of Time emblem on the cover is beautiful to look at just by itself.<br /><br />Content-wise, the first part focuses primarily on the then-newest Zelda game, Skyward Sword, though later sections are devoted to artwork and materials from the other games. The timeline section in the center is a highlight: it shows a breakdown of the story in each game and how it fits into the overall timeline. Dark Horse Comics should be commended in their attention to detail for the translation. Even all of the handwritten notes on the original concept drawings are translated into English. Even the Skyward Sword prequel manga included at the end is well translated.<br /><br />My only complaint is that there could have been more space devoted to showing more development materials from A Link to the Past and Link's Awakening, although this is a fairly minor issue.<br /><br />Overall, Hyrule Historia a wonderful book celebrating the franchise for an outstanding price.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Mr. Child never let's us down with the antics of Mr. Reacher! This was a fast paced thriller with lots of twists and bumps along the way. Thanks for the ride. bryanne
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|This is a great movie.  No special effects, violence or other effects.  Just a warm story.  Helen Hunt is magnificent and her body is that of a 25 year old.  You should see this movie if you are looking for a sophisticated, intelligent and warm movie.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love listening to their music. It's relaxing and interesting at the same time. I also love going to uTube to watch their music videos.
B00280LYIC|4.0|Overall good book for a preteen!  Many predictable events,however. I enjoyed reading this and getting to know the characters in it. Definitely will purchase the next books.
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|As described<br />Nice and bright<br />Hard to change batteries<br />But. Not a show stopper<br />I would recommend and buy again
B004132HZS|5.0|Three words....BEST SHOW EVER!!!!!!I saw the first episode one day upon recommendation and was instantly hooked.  I went out and got the DVD.  I love Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman as Sherlock and Holmes and think they  have awesome chemistry.  Every new character they introduce is amazing.  The modernization of the characters and storylines works flawlessly.  The writing is effortless.
0061743526|5.0|I read To Kill a Mockingbird as a book assignment for my English III class. We broke the book down in chapters and would have an assignment of the chapters to read every class period. We read some in class and what we didn't finish in class was homework. After reading the book I can honestly say it is one of my favorite books. I absolutely loved it and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. It's easy to read and if you really think about it you understand it easily.<br /> At the very beginning of the book it started pretty slow. It was still interesting but it was more of a slow read. Then around chapters 4-6 I just wanted to keep reading. The rest of the book I couldn't put the book down. I wanted to keep reading ahead.<br /> When you start reading you imagine Maycomb to be a town where nothing can go wrong. It's just a small town that everyone loves everyone in. You soon realize its nothing like that. It's just like every town. It has people who don't like one another and you always seem to have that family in every town where they may not be as clean or educated like others and Maycomb is a prime example of how that happens in even the towns that are portrayed as a place where nothing can go wrong.<br /> The book was not only a book that gives you many life lessons to go off of but it also have a little mystery in it. The mystery of Boo was always lingering while you were reading. Where's Boo? Will we ever meet him? Are the rumors true about him? Those questions are always running through your head, even in chapters where Boo isn't mentioned.<br /> To Kill a Mockingbird gives you a good understanding of how racism was a big factor back in the day. Even if whites knew a black was a good person or well educated they would treat them as low as the dirt they walk on. Atticus shows that even though he is peerless he still has peers. He treats everyone as an equal, no matter what race or religion. He doesn't judge anyone. He makes sure he really knows a person before he treats them any differently and even then he will still treat you as an equal and as anyone else.<br /> One thing this novel taught me was that you can't judge someone until you know what they have been through. You have to step into their shoes and walk around in them before you really know what a person goes through and what makes them who they are. I think when everyone reads this they will understand that.<br /> When you read To Kill a Mockingbird you become attached to all of the characters. Everything that happens to them hits you deep. You become almost apart of them. You fear the things they fear and you want the things they want.
B00992CF6W|5.0|everyday my son. come home and play minecraftsnd start suit home and house for the faint to eggs. the game
B0072NWKEC|5.0|Excellent for both the story and the historical context in both Prague and Berlin. I liked this the best of the four other Bernie books
B007SGM084|5.0|I was finally convinced to read the trilogy and loved every minute of it. I could not put it down. I can not wait to read what E L James writes next...
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I don't know what it is about this film, but my fiancee and I can watch it over and over again. It's a very visually interesting film, with very cool framing and lots of lens flare. The storyline, cast, and actions sequences are all very well done and will keep you on the edge of your seat and invested in the characters.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicolas Sparks is such an excellant writer! I love reading his books! This is just one of many that I have read and a lot of them have been made into movies which I enjoy watching also but nothing is better than a good book!!!
B002SJIO5E|5.0|I went into this film not knowing what to expect and was pleasantly surprised at the storyline. The story seems to transform into something unexpected and unravels into a truly interesting journey of the main character. Highly recommend!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I love a good mystery and this classifies as one worth reading. lots of good suspense! Worth reading if one enjoys mystery books!
B003UESJHY|5.0|Fantastic performances in a well-crafted film. The boxing sequences had me on the edge of my seat! My fiancee and I really enjoyed it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book was absolutely breathe takeing. I thoroughly enjoyed the majestic detailing of each chapter and it felt like I was actually in the book. I recommend this book for any teen twenty age and adult ( yes I am a teen, I'm 14) .
B00275EGX8|5.0|Great film if you go into it not expecting your typical action-filled war movie. My fiancee and I love Kathryn Bigalow's films for their subtly and precise storytelling. It's not a story about a war but one person's experience with it.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|I just got this game a week ago and its great I love it and its adorable but I got on yesterday and it kept exiting then it just totally erased my entire game so I restarted and now its deleteing stuff again
0345529057|5.0|Got these for my dad for Christmas and he's been glued to them ever since. They're huge books with teeny tiny print so it took him a while to finish each of them. Now he wants to watch the HBO Game of Thrones -- so more present ideas for me!<br /><br />This set doesn't contain the last book, but I will just purchase that separately :]
B007FXLZ9K|1.0|This is nothing but D class Skinimax porn masquerading as edgy arthouse erotica.  It's not \\"thought provoking\\", it's mindless junk.  Fassbender is way too talented an actor to appear in something this lousy.  You won't care about anything in this film other than the soundtrack which was excellent.  I stopped watching the film halfway through but left it on for the music which was great.  Other than that I could never recommend this film to anyone.  I try to avoid 1 star reviews but this was easily one of the worst films I have ever seen.  Waste of time.
0767836286|4.0|We had this movie years ago on vhs... so we started looking for it on dvd. Great movie with terrorist plot
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Pros:  Fun game. Easy to pass a few minutes of free time.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Although it shows your time and score when you set a new record, it does not show it every time.<br />* It takes three seperate screens to exit the game.<br /><br />The cons can be annoying, but still a fun game.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This cord replaced the cord that came with my kindle. This one works a lot better than the original. I would recommend this to everybody.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|Feedly is an Elegant and efficient app. Its a perfect replace for google reader. Works really well on my kindle fire.
0143039431|5.0|Thanks to the quick response in getting it to me.<br /><br />What a depressing book that is so beautifully written.  Good with Ken Burns' Dustbowl series on PBS
B00004WNE4|5.0|While I have been 'familiar' with the Zombies since the original hits of the mid '60's, which I heard on AM radio during their respective initial releases, I was not yet listening to and/or purchasing albums in those days, just 45s. After being awakened to this album during some live performances of the Zombies while I was aboard the Moody Blues Cruise, I subsequently purchased this album, both on vinyl LP (here), as well as on CD elsewhere.<br /><br />While listening to this I realized that it was released about the same time as the Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour, and with that as a timeframe reference in mind, I realized how great this album really is, both then and now. (I mention this comparison to Magical Mystery Tour for the convenience of those that may be unfamiliar with the Zombies.) In my opinion, the single hit released from this album, &#34;Time of the Season,&#34; is one of the lesser of the songs on this album, with several others even better. I can't imagine anyone not liking this album, unless they they didn't like this style of music as a whole. I recommend it.<br /><br />As far as this vinyl release, the pressing is clean, flat, and quiet, with decent quality mastering. Not Mobile Fidelity® quality, in my opinion, but not bad either, and a good deal for the money.
B007W1BLN0|1.0|I found this movie to be way predictable meaningless and quite boring how concubines that one would find an abandoned school bus in the middle of the wilderness... Waste of time at best !!!?
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|This album is amazing. Really happy to get this deluxe edition with the bonus tracks and video footage.<br /><br />RIP Layne Staley
B00AIJP9BS|2.0|Its more intriguing in concept than in application.  The theme is fun and idea of portable foosball feels like it could be just the thing to pass the time but I just ended up passing on it altogether.  Still some might enjoy the vibrant colors and animation as well as the simple gameplay and solid mechanical response.  Its just not for me
B00AF6B22E|4.0|Denzel has played so many types of roles, that somehow, this one was difficult to watch. Not that it wasn't one of Denzel's performances, (in fact, one of his best); it shows how we as society take for granted, trusting our pilots for safe passage to our destination.<br /><br />I now understand how stress from so many difficult factors, can, and perhaps overcome those, that we take for granted. Many good stars could have played this role, but Denzel makes it easy to understand, hard to accept, and why he is a master of capturing all these, showing that he's one of the best.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I have a busy brain, especially when I'm stressed and REALLY need to sleep.  This app is excellent for helping quiet the mind.  Particularly, I enjoy the ocean and rainfall options since those are two of my favorite sleep sounds.  A wide variety of other static sounds ensure that you should find exactly what you need to help you focus or relax.  A built-in digital clock keeps the lights low at night and you can even adjust the length of time you want the app to run AND you can even set an alarm clock within the app so you don't need something separate to help you rouse you from successful relaxation.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game! I find my self playing it all the time.I can't get enough of it .I would definitely recommend this games to who ever is a horse lover like me :)
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Jewel matching is nothing new but game boards featuring barriers, locks, frozen tiles, and more unique obstacles certainly up the ante and keep things interesting.  That's what you'll find with this game.  While the variety is definitely a welcomed change the progressive difficulty starts to become quite frustrating in the later levels.  Still the storyline adds a little something extra, as do the earned bonuses in each level that change the gameplay depending on how long you bank the bonus (to cash in for bigger aids, etc).
B000I8G5NA|4.0|This was a funny movie worth the time that I spent watching, some of the gags could have been done better
B000660UN0|5.0|This CD is a MUST HAVE for any Eric Clapton fan! I love it! Great interpretation of Robert J's work!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Twisted driven Intriguing I have read all three books and find a need for more .Don't stop your skill and detail is riveting and very focused. Keep it up.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Fantastic show, music CD and Documentary DVD ... the show is a MUST SEE if you are ever in Las Vegas!!
B0067R0APK|5.0|I really like this app, it is well thought-out and logical.  The paid version removes all of the adds (cheap), and I like that.  I also like the way that multiple locations are configured; this one is a keeper.
B009MYARIK|3.0|Like many people here I am one of Kinsella's fans. I have read all of her books and many of the ones she had written with her real name too (Madeleine Wickham). I have to say that it pains me to write a review with less than 4 stars because her books are always entertaining but I really need to be honest about this one.<br />When you start reading a Kinsella book you know that the story is going to be crazy and most of the characters are over the top \\"insane\\" but at least most of them are likable. Well, when the book started I wanted to strangle Lottie. She tells everybody (literally) that her boyfriend is going to propose and the guy hasn't even open his mouth yet. Needless to say I couldn't relate nor even like any of the characters because they are so extremely ridiculous!<br />One good thing...the story (as stupid as it is, let's be honest here!) keeps you entertained and you can finish the book. It didn't take me long even though is kind of long.<br />My advice is do not waste your hard earned money and borrow it from the library or just wait and buy the paperback edition. I really hope Sophie Kinsella comes back in her next book. This one, definitely not a good one!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I heard  a lot of good reviews about The Good Wife. I've never seen the show. I was curious, now I am a fan after watching the premier episode.  The Good Wife  is an intelligent show.  My Kindle is just awesome !
B001CDL6YS|1.0|Hello all,<br /><br />This review has nothing to do with the actual music. The music sounds great, period. I am writing this to let everyone know that the double LP version of this has a misprint. Side \\"D\\", which should play \\"In the Presence of Enemies Part II\\", replays the second to last song \\"The Ministry of Lost Souls\\". After I discovered this error I went looking to see if this was just a one time deal and I found a forum from way back in 2009 where people were talking about the same problem. If what they said is true on the forum, there was two \\"waves\\" of pressings for this album. One from Germany and one from the USA. The ones that were printed in the USA were the ones with the problem (Road Runner Records). I emailed Road Runner Records to ask about what I could do about this issue, and I am just waiting to hear back from them. When I do, I will post their response, grant it they are the ones that can actually do anything about it.<br /><br />-Chris
B007R21JJK|5.0|First, I do not live in the U.S., so the motherboard takes longer than 30 days to be in my hands. When I finally received the product, I started to set up my new pc, after installing the i7 3770K and 16GB of corsair vengance, press the power button and it turned out that the card panel showed the error 15 and then 51. It didn't even reached the bios, so I thought it was an installation error and remove the whole pc and started all over again, getting the same result. I've been looking for solutions online and found that this motherboard has already thrown the same error to several people and the final solution with Gigabyte tech support is to change it because the card is defective. The Amazon return policies indicate that devolution or refund applies within the next 30 days after purchase, so I can not return the product and it either works well! I am very disappointed with this brand (Gigabyte), I read a lot before buying it because it had the best value for money. Now I lost my money and I have a damaged motherboard.  I do not recommend this brand because it is NOT guarantee that their products work well.  01/06/2013 I communicate through email directly to the GIGABYTE tech support, I identified a number of steps to correct the fault, none of them worked. The last option was offered, before changing the factory default, was to update the BIOS to the latest version available for exact model GA-Z77X-UD3H. Follow the instructions and then sent me the update, everything worked fine, I'm very happy that the motherboard recognize the RAM. I will be commenting on how it goes after installing the operating system and applications. I hope the motherboard is stable and present no further complications.  30/12/2016 Hello everyone, after more two years the motherboard is completely normal, without problems. Time showed the quality of product

0486278077|2.0|When I got this book it said there were a few marks and bent pages. Not so much. There's dark blue highlights on every single page marking huge paragraphs. Normally I am not so bothered by highlights but these are so dark that it is distracting.
B0067Q04AM|5.0|I love this album, full of great features, including Lalah Hathaway, Erykah Badu, Bilal, & Musiq Soulchild, to name a few. The music is incredible & the songs are infused with new & old school R&B with a touch of Jazz & Hip Hop . He also did a cool remake of &#34;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#34;. He now has a new fan!!

B00846REIS|5.0|I wrote a review for Reflected in You, and it holds true for this book as well. I am most eager to download the last book in this &#34;Better than Fifties&#34; trilogy. I do hate though, that you post the final book when it is not yet released. I,v been waiting for 2 1/2 months since I finished the first 2 editions......sigh!
076115678X|5.0|As a curly hair girl I would have loved to have this information years ago. Since I bought and began trying some of the suggestions my hair actually looks and feels healthier. This book is worth buying...I bought my family/friends some for Christmas gifts because I wanted to share the information. They are glad I did :-). I could not believe the transformation of my hair in a few short weeks.

B00BHMETKC|3.0|A good film although perhaps not quite worthy of the title Picture of the Year.  The performances are fine  but the story-telling technique and direction of this historical event feel uninspired.  And since the audience is already aware that the people are actually rescued, a more imaginative approach to the storytelling itself  might have made it more engaging .  A good example would be Alan J. Pakula's Oscar winning film \\"All the Presidents Men,\\" wherein an historical event became a fascinating, engaging piece of cinema.  As it stands, \\"Argo\\" is an entertaining first attempt from an unexperienced director that's just a notch above most thriller/action/ style films.
0446554995|5.0|This is more like the early works by these guys. Love the Pendergast  character, although he is a little less interesting.
B009AMANBA|3.0|Because I am hearing impaired ( Deaf as a Post) I require either closed caption or Sub-titles. This had both, but the announcer in the background had neither. I have no idea as to what he was saying. It was interesting that politics then were very much as they are today.Politicians only care about what the country can do for them and not what they can do for their country (Pres J.F. Kennidy)
B005M2A4D4|5.0|Love how Steven Moffat can get Doctor Who out of a sticky wicket! Recommend watching in order to prevent spoilers.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|The beginning is just a tad slow, then WHAM!  I thought it was amazing.  The acting is great, and the effects leave you with goose bumps.  Make sure you order up a box of Kleenex, especially if you have kids, it'll rip your heart out. Not 1 hint of foul language of any kind in this film, however, there are 2 scenes of brief upper torso nudity.  Also, some of the wounds might be a little gruesome for the super young ones.  If your married, you'll hug your spouse a little tighter after this one, and if you have kids, it'll make you want to keep them close to you....  Loved it!

B005S9EKCW|5.0|I was skeptical going in to this movie because it was a musical, but it moved me way beyond anything I expected.  A great story of redemption.  The acting by all characters were outstanding.
B000002J3W|5.0|I think this incredible album is not so recognized, because when it was recorded, the world was totally Grunge, and everything that´s not from that wave was out of sigh...While i really like the first 2 SKID ROW´s great albums, this is their MASTERPIECE!!!!! All the songs are simply GREAT!!!! Skid Row incorporated something from Alice in Chains and Pantera and the band become a HEAVY METAL machine with Sebastian Bach screaming like there´s no tomorrow!!!! well, i really like SUBHUMAN RACE and ALL the songs rocks(even the radio ballad BREAKIN DOWN is cool).....MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|My wife and I are really big fans of the movie &#34;Knocked Up&#34;, so we were very excited to watch t&#34;Tis is 40&#34;. We found the movie overall very funny, but there were quite a number of scenes that were almost too awkward to be funny. This might just be our particular sense of humor, but we wanted to warn future viewers that it can get pretty awkward. Overall, I would still recommend this movie!
B000002INR|5.0|Well, the 3 SKID ROW albums with Sebastian Bach vocals are simply GREAT!!!!! Their debut is a fun HEAVY ROCK album where ALL the songs ROCKS(even the radio ballad I REMEMBER YOU is nice)...I really like this HEAVY ROCK debut from Skid Row!!!!!!!YEAH!!!!!!!
0143122916|4.0|I was a bit underwhelmed by this book.  Not that the story isn't compelling, but that the journey is yet not finished. Something is held back, not quite in view. Too many people will read this book for the descriptions of abuse and confinement, not for the story of government interruption of citizens' lives for the sake of power. This left me with too many questions about what is being done, who is not doing what needs doing.  And no one seemed to want to comfort or educate the victim....he is left to fend in a new world on his own, confusing and traumatic. Whole lives wasted. Glad I read it, but it feels unfinished.
B0050LJIRK|3.0|I agree with other reviews....actually, the instrumental of Limp Bizkit is very good....ok, it´s the very similar NU METAL NO SOLOS style, but the guitar, bass and drums are pretty decent.....Some Fred vocals are decent, but.....most of what he raps is soooooooo lame....SHARK ATTACK, BRINGIN BACK and SHOTGUN are good tunes, but the whole album is a WAY too long trip with some of the most stupid lyrics you can find in the planet Earth......
B002Q7JYPC|4.0|I bought this album to hear some songs you can't find on any other album. Most of the other songs are like fillers.
B000092Q4U|5.0|LAMB OF GOD is just a GREAT GREAT HEAVY THRASH METAL!!!! I like most all their stuff, and i think AS THE PALACE BURNS is where this gifted band start to create some remarkable METAL!!!! NEW AMERICAN GOSPEL is GREAT, but you can ´t really understand what Randy Blythe is saying and all the stuff is WAY RAW....On AS THE PALACES BURNS, Randy´s vocals and the band improved A LOT!!!! This is a collection of incredibly HEAVY songs to destroy everything, even your brain!!!!!!! LAMB OF GOD is GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0307887448|5.0|*Note: I didn't technically read this book; I listened to the audiobook read by Will Wheaton (the fact that he voiced it only makes it more nerdy and therefore enhances the story).<br /><br />There are, presently, over 1,700 reviews of this book. So, you have plenty of information to guide you in your decision to purchase or pass-over this book. That said, I will not offer much in this review.<br /><br />I NEVER review books on this website. Not for any particular reason; I just don't do it. However, I enjoyed this book so much that I just wanted my opinion and rating etched in time via Amazon.<br /><br />This is a wonderful read, particularly if you like nerdy things, sci-fi, or grew up in the '80s and can appreciate a lot of '80s references. A LOT of them. Simply put, this book is engaging, gripping, descriptive, and fun. I HIGHLY recommend this book. I recommend it to everyone with whom I discuss reading. It is that good.
B000002JSP|5.0|LED ZEPPELIN create masterpiece after masterpiece in their magic solid career, and In Through the Out door is the grand Finale for such a phenomenal band!!!! Fool in the Rain, Hot Dog, Carouselambra and In the Evening are some pearls from this album!!!! Well done, Zeppelin!!!! The best band EVER!!!(sorry, Beatles and Queen, but this is true!!!)
B005LAIIHG|5.0|When I saw this movie in the theatre I knew that I had to buy it for my home.  GREAT movie!
B0002S94OS|5.0|There´s not much stuff i like on music in the last decade.....I really miss better lyrics, inspired well crafted musicians, a solid singer.....well, i got that with LAMB OF GOD!!!! I grow up listening to PANTERA, SLAYER, SEPULTURA and ALICE IN CHAINS, great METAL bands that will pass through the test of time.... and LAMB OF GOD, in my opinion, is that kind of band!!!! I got All their albums since NEW AMERICAN GOSPEL(really raw one), and there´s only great songs with a hallucinated great singer and a gifted band with huge skills to play METAL!!!!LAMB OF GOD is GREAT!!!! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED if you like a HEAVY fusion between PANTERA and SLAYER...yes, it´s that great!!!!! WELL DONE!!!!
0385349831|4.0|The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho ranks in my top ten favorite reads of all time.  I have read it multiple times aloud to my classes and have recommended it to countless people.  It is a timeless story that I revisit again and again (which is saying something because I usually don't like to reread).  So when TLC book tours announced the tour for Manuscript in Accra, I knew I had to read it.<br /><br />The Manuscript in Accra begins on July 14, 1099.  In the holy city of Jerusalem, people of the three main faiths gather to hear a man speak.  The three monotheistic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam share the holy city.  The Crusaders lie just outside the city gates and the people face an unknown future in a time of war.<br /><br />The Copt or Greek speaker, gathers in the Holy city to share his wisdom with the masses.  After the copt's initial speech, he offers to answer questions from the crowd.  He answers questions based on anxiety, love, loyalty, sex, death, war, beauty and much more.  Each chapter is full of quotable wisdom and inspiration.<br /><br />\\"No matter how you are feeling get up every morning and prepare to let your light shine forth.<br />Those with eyes to see will see your light and be enchanted by it.\\" Pg. 106<br /><br />This book is meant to be read slowly and savored.  Read a chapter a day, use a highlighter, and reflect on your life and on how the passages will enhance it.  The Manuscript in Accra has something in it for everyone.  It is really not a story at all but a guide or a book of wisdom you can use to apply to your life.  It is in question and answer format and is religious in nature.<br /><br />\\"Do one thing:  Live the life you always wanted to live.  Avoid criticizing others and concentrate on fulfilling your dreams.  This may not seem very important to you, but God, who sees all, knows the example you give is helping Him to improve the world.  And each day, He will bestow more blessings upon it.\\" pg. 42<br /><br />I will definitely have to reread this.  It is enlightening and it is perfect for the times your heart cries out for a book that will bring you peace, or a new idea,  or a different way of thinking about something.ely have to reread this.

B003F3NDOE|5.0|This series really grows on a person.  It is funny, clean and entertaining.  Some on-going drama and storyline keep you guessing!
0061478784|5.0|In Howl's Moving Castle, Dianna Wynn Jones has created a world that makes more sense than the one I live in. I've read it four times in the past year.<br />Sophie Hatter lives in the small but prosperous town of Market Chipping, and life isn't bad there, just a bit dull. Her sisters have been apprenticed out by their mother and Sophie is kept on at the family hat shop dressing the hats in the way only she can - she has a knack with a needle and thread. Bored and listless, she longs to strike out on her own, but it takes a strange curse by the Witch of the Waste to set her on her way. Lots happens after that and mysteries are revealed, and though the plot is interesting and fun it is the telling that keeps me coming back. I love Howl. I love Sophie. I love Calcifer the fire demon. I've even managed to get Billy Crystal's voice out of my head when I read Calficer's dialogue (Crystal did the voice in the movie). The dialogue is always purposeful and the action is always moving forward, but I think, and I'm sure I'm not alone, that the best parts are between Howl and Sophie. They have a teasing, bickering relationship and it is fun to observe.<br /><br />There is a Studio Ghibli film based on this book. I saw the movie first and fell in love with it and then I read this book and fell in love all over again, but they are very, very different. IF you've seen the movie it won't help your enjoyment of this book if you expect it to be the same. Like all of the Ghibli films this one has a strong female character and bad guys that aren't really bad through and through. Sophie is every bit as strong as in the book, but the bad guys are bad guys,and they're happy to prove it. In the movie Howl is kind of a somber character who is troubled by the war. He's a cad in the book and he knows it, never mind a coward and a womanizer. He's pretty delicious, really, and his flaws are so well developed.<br /><br />It's a fantastic book and I recommend it highly to anyone who enjoys: fantasy, light romance, comedy, sweet stories that you wish would never end.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love this app. I can play this game for hours. I will tell everyone about this game. Keep up the good work. I WANT MORE.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The writing is good, the concept is great, and while it could be considered science fiction/fantasy, the underlying truths are universal.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My son and daughter love this game.  It's fast pace with quick action.  To see there face light up and there heart race, this is the game!
B007VTVGAQ|2.0|Lyrically this album is very clever (but what else would you expect from such a talented peotry-set-to-music songwriter).  However, this album is very difficult to enjoy.  There are a few songs that tease around the edges of enjoyability, but they don't deliver.  The 4 star average, gushing 5 star reviews, and Grammy nominations are a mystery to me.  Maybe the poetry of the lyrics really speaks to a certain niche of people?  And they are willing to overlook the difficult accompaniment?  I assume that the only people buying this album are Fiona Apple fans; four albums in people should know if they like her music or not.
B0073TZ1AA|5.0|This is so cool! Thank you Betsy True for your instructions.  Listening to it reading the Table of Contents of a book I am writing!  The voice sounds fine to me.
B00BIRRDZ4|5.0|It seemed pretty easy to target the easy-listening, seventies SoCal songcraft penned by Taylor Goldsmith as a sentimental homage to Jackson Browne, Loco, and others from the Asylum Records roster from 30 years ago. But on Dawes' third release, it seems that stories don't end ... there is an understated lyrical power coming from very obtuse angles (as well as from the right angle) that leave me feeling off balance, yet centered in his messages of homesickness, lost love, and hopeful expectation for the next generation. The production is a little more polished, which may serve to distract the listener moreso than on \\"Nothing Is Wrong\\" and \\"North Hills,\\" but it is apparent that the longer they are together, the more cohesive the band has become. Each song is its own mini-masterpiece, quietly nudging the audience toward a feeling of unease. I know I read criticisms of the lead single \\"From A Window Seat\\" being a co-opted from Steely Dan, Dire Straits, and the Grateful Dead, but it really doesn't matter because these blended perceptions are all right and they're all wrong. \\"It's like trying to make out every word, when they should simply hum along.\\" Truly a great album in these days of manufactured musical personae, Dawes is perfectly flawed, just as they are.
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|This is a good CD to join in worship to our God! I listen at home and while driving to connect with my Father and His son, Jesus!

B008673ZAQ|5.0|A very fast read. Loved it and can`t wait for the next in the series.  Would recommend it to a friend.
B007R7PPJK|4.0|I have been using Scythe fans for many years and I this is the first heatsink I try, I was specifically looking for a solution that didn't require to remove the motherboard and this one fits the bill. I'm a bit worried about the mounting mechanism, it has two clips and each one with a flimsy spring, but it seems to hold fine. Time will tell.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|If you love guns milatary you will love this app.Fighting the kra is the best. Get this app fun game.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|Got this for a compilation server and works as expected, because compiling is an integer unit heavy process, the 8 integer cores are used properly in this solution. It is very fast. But do yourself a favor, get another heatsink when you bought this CPU! The included one is noisy as an airplane engine (The guys at the office called my workstation the same name as the local airport!) and doesn't cool properly (Got a couple of forced shutdowns!).

B00BGIBVP8|2.0|This movie had some funny parts, but I'm not sure it had a point.  It is two hours long and drops the f bomb every other word.  I was very disappointed.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|Every additional year that goes away makes this an even better and withstanding classic, incredible how it holds over the time.
B007Q476KU|5.0|This was a great movie.  It had all the elements of feeling, tenderness, fear, love, hate, anxiety, fulfillment...the list goes on.  Great Movie!!!!!
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Got it for Shadow of the Colossus but I liked ICO the most. Maybe because it was like a very long Zelda dungeon and I love the Zelda series. Shadow of the Colossus was a bit repetitive, but the three or so colossi I defeated were very exciting.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|it's chess, what more can I say. The only thing I don't like is the fact that the other player (computer) is so quick with a reply. I'm used to the game on my computer and it isn't that quick. It throws me off, a little, but I'm getting used to it.
B009AP2G26|1.0|Last year at this time, season 4 was promoted to be Finn and Rachel and Kurt and Santana in NYC together.<br />Instead, we got Finn stuck in Lima, Rachel shacking up with a male prostitute. If the writers hadn't decided to stall Finchel all season  we could have gotten what they promised. As it is I have no intention of purchasing season 4 on DVD and have only purchased  on Amazon the Finchel episodes: The Break Up, Glease, Swan Song, I Do and Sweet Dreams.I'm so sick of the mentality that you have to save things for the last episode of the season. Well real life intruded in this case and all of the stalling backfired big time. Hopefully, we will finally get Finchel & Kurt & Santana in NYC together as it was supposed to be.

0143119680|1.0|This entire novel seems like a joke played by Deborah Harkness.  The more you read, the funnier the joke gets.  Believe me, Harkness is laughing at us while vacationing at some nice resort, enjoying the check from her publishers. Kudos to her public relations team.  I bought this book from an actual book store so I payed the suggested retail price.  I am an avid reader and I was led to believe that this was a \\"well researched novel with vampires and witches but for the intelligent reader.\\"  It is just that....for an intelligent seventh grader.  If you are young enough to have never spoken to an adult man or had a romantic relationship then you will be delighted!  You can enjoy 600 pages of a wishy-washy \\"heroine\\" that manages to excel at academia and physical pursuits alike but somehow becomes helpless and weepy once a 1500-year-old vampire enters her life (she literally almost drowns in her own tears).  He's handsome, intelligent and wealthy but brooding, boring, chauvinistic.  Also, they fall in love after three weeks and then get married in some bizarre vampire ceremony. Oh, you thought I was joking?  I'm afraid not.  That is actually the \\"plot\\" of this meandering drivel of a novel.  Trees were sacrificed to make thousands of copies of this book and thousands of unsuspecting book lovers spent their time trying to find the plot with no success.  If you are reading this and you are over the age of twelve, do not purchase this book. If you have already purchased this book, gotten halfway through it and are feeling guilty about abandoning it, do not worry.  You have permission to put it aside.  I know you hate to do this as a book lover but truly, if you got even halfway through, you are to be applauded.  I heard some of the hype about this novel and thought that perhaps I was being too harsh until I read some of the more honest reviews and realized I was not alone.  I am going to read some Junot Diaz in order to detox from this abomination.
B00884GR0W|5.0|Can't beat the price, and my kids love the action and worlds they build.  Lot of fun for a great price!

B000I9U75G|1.0|This movie was terrible, and shamed the entire Godzilla franchise.  Stick to the originals, this movie was shameful, and lacking originality at all turns.

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Same as the full version on line. My two year old enjoys touching the screen but doesn't have much luck - maybe they need a kids version?
B0089LOG02|4.0|So touching. I could hardly put the book down.  I did not even know about this part of history.  Great read.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I loved this film Joss Whedon is the man. He's truly a Comicbook Fan and it shows! The Character development is beyond Awesome. Nothing wrong with this film at all everyone is relevant in this movie. Do I really have to say A Must Own!....
B007TK77QE|3.0|The ending was a bit abrupt and predictable. There was many things aboutthe book I liked but it just didn't quite come together for me.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|I liked The Redbreast because it was exciting, having a lot of suspense and also it was partly In Norway where I have bewen.
0894803123|5.0|recipes so easy, it is hard to believe how simple and yummy  - this book inspirated me to take a chance a create my own flavors! Not so fast - I will keep my day job and let the experts (Ben & Jerry) keep making what we all love - but I really did think that in honor of Twilight my Red Velvet Garlic \\"Bella me kiss\\" would be a instant hit!!
B004D5H2M2|4.0|Very nice collection - includes much of Stratosphere, which is my personal favorite of theirs, along with other great stuff.<br />First time I put it on - my 5 year old son got out the drum machine and played along. Another generation of TD fans are born... Very cool.
6305428042|5.0|great movie, i love it, so funny movie. i was young want this i was waited so long i got, i am happy thank.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|At 1,200 pages in the print edition, I doubt I would have gotten through this had it not been on my Kindle.  That said, the drawback with the Kindle is the difficulty in flipping back to previous chapters to re-read passages on the characters in a current chapter.<br /><br />This book is clearly pivotal in moving forward the relationships of everyone and the on-going war.  No spoiler, but more than in the first two books, there were many, many unexpected turns in the plot.  I'm watching on HBO and can't wait to see the two wedding scenes...nothing like anything in seasons one and two, for sure.<br /><br />If you felt bogged down by the first two books, perservere...it's well worth the effort!
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Though I loved this book, it was my least favorite of the five in this series. It was closing up the series and I didn't want it to end. Now onto her highlander series...
B005I0DUMC|4.0|Good story line, and excellent group of actors. Action mixed with a plot that is driven by headlines. A movie I wanted in my collection.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|So suit for my fujinon camera.<br />It designed for easy to bring anywhere.<br />And thing ilike the most is the design<br /><br />:-)
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|HOW A BAND FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY CAN DO HOMAGE TO THE  AMERICAN WEST AND ACTUALLY PUT TOGETHER LYRICS THAT FIT WITH THE INDIVIDUALS IS PRETTY AMAZING. THEY DUG OUT SOME OBSCURE CHARACTERS (LOLA MONTEZ FOR ONE) AND WROTE SOME REALLY GREAT SONGS. OF COURSE OTHERS LIKE DOC HOLLIDAY ARE WELL KNOWN. THESE GUYS DO COUNTRY LYRICS WITH WHAT I WOULD DESCRIBE AS METAL BLUES MUSIC<br />NO CATEGORY FOR THIS BAND REALLY. VOCALS ARE POWERFULL AND SOME OF THE INSTRUMENT CHOICES ARE ODD BUT IT WORKS WELL. I IMAGINE THEY MUST BE AMAZING LIVE.<br />BUY THIS AND LISTEN FIVE TIMES, YOU WILL BE HOOKED
0547848412|1.0|I ordered this book because I needed it for a class and it arrived in 2 days. Everything was going well. The book started out slow, but it got better, a lot better. I loved it, but I don't know what to do now. The book goes from page 256 to page 289. It's missing 33 pages and 289 - 336 repeats itself.. Anyways from what I read, the story was good.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|LOVE CLUTCH. THE TITLE IS GREAT, AND ANY SONG ABOUT AN OLDS 88 FROM WHEN WE USED TO BUILD REAL CARS WITH LOTS OF SPEED AND NO BRAKES IS A WINNER IN MY BOOK. I THINK THIS IS EVERY BIT AS GOOD AS THE LAST ONE.
B00AQCMK32|4.0|one of my favorite apps. worth the 2.50. only bad thing is it gets too easy near the end. that aside,  4 stars.
055357342X|3.0|Of the first 3 books, this is undoubtedly the best. The first book sets the table for the entire series. The second book is merely a bridge. In the third book, much of the conflict created in the first 2 books is resolved even while new conflicts arise or are exasperated. At the end of this book, I felt like I was finally done with the first book.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|too many good things going for this game to list here. nec virus is my favorite. definitely worth the buck and then some.
B008DBF5Z8|4.0|For the money, a good deal compared to the more expensive and larger Elmo. I would give it 5 stars if it had a larger vertical veiwing area, but no regrets.
B00A0L7PE8|3.0|This is The Purple One's only newly released music-- as regards physical product-- since the giveaway CD. That album had some excellent tunes on it. This is a maxi-disc, which has one good tune, progressively beaten into submission. It's a cool song, which could've appeared on anything since the late 1980s. But the mixes are pretty useless.<br /><br />There's a strong case for Prince's maxi-singles to be fully considered alongside his album releases. This would especially be true for the turn of the 1990s, when tracks like 'Horny Pony' and 'Call The Law' were not otherwise available. The multi-mix CDs got tired really quick.<br /><br />Full marks for the 'keep us guessing' factor. Not full marks for the music.
0300169787|4.0|It was everything I thought it would be. If you are a fan of Alexander McQueen then this is the book for you.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I chose this rating because this is no doubt the best book I've ever read I couldn't put the book down
B005HSL626|3.0|this game is generally fun, but after a very short time I got bored with it. It's probably because the free version doesn't have as much to it as the version you pay for
B00C391Y3I|5.0|I got to see this tour on it's final night in Biloxi, Mississippi. It was hands down one of the concerts I have ever been to. The band was extremely tight and ripped through some of their all time hits and classics. This DVD should be something that is a must have for all Priest fans.
B003IEJZUG|4.0|First, let me make it clear that this is not your usual castaway story that features a plane crash, a black stallion, or even an island really. It is utterly original. I loved it all through. The only reason I gave it four stars is because i believe that five star ratings should be used sparingly. As noted in this review's title, it is inspiring, as well as completely emotionally diverse. Sometines you'll be sad, other times so horrifed that you wont be sure if you can take another word. Happiness and grief and even guilt will force to put the book down for a few hours and find somthing usefull to do with yourself. I reccomend this book to anyone who is in for the whole ride, because skipping distastfull scenes or images is not an option. This book turns ypu into Pi Patel and it does it well. Every word is vital to the &#34;getting&#34; of the entire story. If you do not want to &#34;experience&#34; gruesome cannibalism or deep emotional pain from losing your family or the awesome joy of finding land after 220 days at lonely sea or wierd botanical discoveries, don't buy this book, its a waste of money and time. But if such an adventure is to your liking and you can retain your sanity on a lifeboat with a Bengal Tiger, then if i were you i would press that buy button immediately. If you are the latter, then get your starving indian boy on baby and dont do anything else but read this book.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|I enjoy  all of the Boz's music. This cd is easy to allow to play over and over again. He does his own versions of classic songs to perfection.
B00821OX98|5.0|This series has a great story line and plenty of interesting characters. I hope they do make a season 3.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I wasn't sure about this game but for free how can you go wrong. But surprisingly I found it fun and can't wait till my coins rebuild.
B008US4PBY|5.0|Used it to connect Xbox 360 and PS3 controllers to my Xbox or PS3 and works like a charm. Certainly worth the price!
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|I keep this DVD to watch with my fourth graders. They enjoy it and I enjoy watching it again. Great for character study and inferencing.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The interweaving of story lines is exceptionally well done, coupled with a researched, intricate background and gripping plot. Expertly thought through and constructed.
B007H7XJD4|1.0|Having already wasted 1 hour and 51 minutes watching this ridiculously bad film, I'll make this short: The acting is pathetic, violence is over the top and often without reason, and the fight scenes are not very interesting. Save your time and money, watch anything but this.
B00BTYP6QE|1.0|i really hated it sorry to say but i mean just different backeounds and junk but 99&cent; total waste!!! just stay with the othef one
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was fantastic! I read it for my bookclub but enjoyed it so much that I wish there was a sequal to it!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I actually got HBO because of this series - read the hardcover books years ago and the folks at HBO are doing justice to them in a big way.  Now if he'll just survive to finish the series! I see many DVD sets ahead.  One major problem with my set, disc with third episode has 'skips'.  As some of the replay on HBO have same problem, I'm not sure how to 'fix' this with Amazon??
6305252521|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, which is impressive because I don't even like Jim Carrey that much. It really makes you think about your life and if you are being watched. It almost is a life changing movie... But don't worry, a change for good.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This by far is the best Book I have ever read<br />Read the sample before you buy this book though cause it will get you even more sucked in
031603973X|5.0|This is not only a fun complex pop up book, but also the actual book, A Christmas Carol,  decided in the original 3parts that it was written in. Depending on the quality of the one you are looking to purchase.  It is great for Christmas,  and for all family's.
6301643410|5.0|This is my favorite Michael Douglas movie. It does get a bit violent at times, but the action is non-stop, the acting is great, and the primarily Japanese locations makes it very interesting. Definitely worth tasking the time to watch.......
055357342X|5.0|I have found most of the books are like this.  Alot of setup for the end of the book but, once things start happening it is absolutely enthralling.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Love that you have to go out to get the animals from the wild instead of just buying them like in other zoo games. Lots of fun to sit and relax to at night :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best game I have played. Seems so realistic. If you like horses you will love this game.. I will say this again best game ever you will LOVE this game
B00BEZTMQ8|2.0|I did not like the book either. I loved all three Lord of the Ring movies. Do not plan to view other two Hobbit movies when they are released.
B006GHA9VQ|5.0|If you like Andrew Lloyd Weber then you will love this second phantom! Totally amazing! Love never dies is unreal you will enjoy
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|The fact that the story is real makes this film amazing, the acting is flawless and the story is touching and beautiful and inspiring.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|The best hand held game I have ever played. The graphics are very good and I like enjoy playing online with friends
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Tap game puzzle with a story to discover as you play.  Quick tutorial at the beginning to help you along.  Nothing too complicated to frustrate for hours.  Very enjoyable.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|I've heard a lot about this series from friends but I just don't have time to devote to reading these long books. So I thought I'd check out the show. I absolutely love it. Don't tell my wife, but I think I'm in love with daenerys. I really like that the story isn't predictable and my wife enjoys the fantasy aspect of it. I tell everyone to watch this show! I'm the kind of person who has to own my favorite things-if I can afford it of course- so I had to buy all the seasons out so far. I can't wait for the next one.
B0082SU98U|5.0|Pollyanna reminds me of a friend of mine who is a little burst of light. I loved this book. I highly recommend it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a great opportunity for the horse lovers to have a little fun!<br />I love this game so I rate it......5 stars out of 5 yah! BROFIST!!!!!
145210655X|5.0|Bought it for my bloke for the xmas after we had our son. He loved it. I love it and I don't even get all the jokes!
157421327X|1.0|This book, along with the instructions on toothpick boxes, is the final, Platonic Solid nail in the coffin of civilization.  This is the crap you doodle during meetings and while making shopping lists.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|I have already seen all the movies in ths sequel and own the first four in this series so it is normal to purchase the fifth.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|The characters and the setting felt real-- as if Haynes had lived in the places she described, known people like her characters, and known relationships similar to the relationships between her characters. I felt I was being told a story by a keen observer rather than by someone who creates characters out of parts of herself, which can also work, but which doesn't allow the same kind of access to experience unlike my own. Maybe because of this approach, the whacko boyfriend remained more of an enigma than he would have in a story by someone who created her characters from the inside out. But the unknowable otherness of this man suited the story. The only strains on the story's credibility were when the author sacrificed believable storytelling to trumped-up pacing--for example by trying to convince us that the protagonist felt things were okay so an ensuing disturbance would have more shock value.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|this game is fun but sometimes it just will not start.other wise it is  really fun to play. when you get it going it is very fan.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Really fun . I love making different hair styles and washing and blow drying their hair. Me and my friends love making really funny hair styles,putting bows on them and putting hats, glasses, and earrings  on them.<br />  It's fun to straighten and curl their hair. I love how their eyes follow you. I also love to color their hair<br /><br />Fun  Fun  Fun
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Have you ever read a book that changes you in some way? This one (actually the series) did it for me.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|This doll is the perfect size for my 2yr old.  She carries it with her everywhere and its the only doll I could find that didn't look creepy.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I love these little apps. So much can be done with them. I use it on my kindle fire as a backup to my cell phone.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I was slightly displeased by the price of the book, but after reading it... I realize why it costed so much. It was very indepth with alot of twists and turns. I couldn't put it down.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|A game that is great for the kindle, and is a good distraction from life. The graphics are adequate enough.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|Great Quality Simple design effective case. elastic band hold the case closed and it protects the Kindle from the abuse of my 2 year old
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Parts of this book were hard to read but were necessary to the backstory & current motivation of the characters. The payoff is worth it in the end. It will help you look at people on the fringes just a bit differently. Heartwarming story.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|Don't do much with it, but it works for what I need...the amount I spend watching it is miniminal OK
B0073TZ1AA|3.0|I followed the advice in C. Medlin's review here and installed IVONA with the Kendra voice.  Much more listenable.  I'm not on a KF so didn't have a problem installing it,  nor do I need to play anything other than standard PDF files.  I could see how that could be a deal breaker for other users.  One point off for limiting where I can navigate to select the file to read.  A common/convenient default is fine,  but don't keep me from accessing other storage locations.  Another point off for no clear option to exit/quit the app.  It's good that it can play in the background, but when I'm done I want to be sure it's shut off.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|Through out the years I have had many sound systems.<br />This compilation is as if I had never heard most of the songs.<br />Wow.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Like my last review; it's a controller not a game. It is however, precisely what I ordered. Works very well; nothing wrong with it at all.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I like all the book i read from DeMille but this one did not catch me. Story is developing very slowly...
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Everything went smoothly.  My Kids like the movie a lot . We bought it to play in the car on road trips.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Just downloading this game for something to. It is ok. Wish it had a little more time. Haven't really figured out the whole concept of the lives. But we shall see. All in all a good game.
B002P79KAC|5.0|At the recommendation of some friends I checked out Big Bang Theory season 1 and found it to be funny but not amazing.  Season 2 really takes the show to a new level though.  The characters have been established, the in-jokes have been set, and now the writers really start cranking out some great episodes.  I highly recommend giving this series a shot.  The first season is funny on it's own, but it really gets better the more episodes you watch.  Great show all around.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Interesting characters, complex relationships, great plots, fascinating legal facts and maneuvers,<br />good perspective on defense attorneys and their methods, gripping story line.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Not too much to say about Elf.  If you haven't seen it before I highly recommend giving it a watch.  Will Ferrell steps outside his usual roles and really hits a home run.  This movie is a good watch for the whole family, not as raunchy as his normal parts, and there are great moments for people of all ages.  My wife rates this as one of her top 10 movies, and I definitely enjoy it every time I watch.  Highly recommended.
B000E1NWJQ|5.0|My b-in-law reqested this on this wish list and he said he has thoroughly enjoyed it.  Includes some great pieces!
B000FCKGPC|3.0|The Song of Ice and Fire series is incredible, and well-worth a read.  This particular installment, book 4, is an unfortunate step back from book 3.  There is a great deal of detail in this book, lots of little tidbits that help develop characters and situations in subtle ways, but a lot really feels unnecessary.  I can't help but feel like book 4 and 5 could have been combined into a single volume with half the details, and the main ideas would still have come across just fine.<br /><br />Still, this series is great, and if you've made it this far it's well worth continuing.
1451695187|5.0|One of the best books I've read.  Really made you aware that there really is an after life. I recommend it to everyone.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The Ice and Fire series is an amazing read, and I recommend it for just about anyone.  This book, A Storm of Swords, is by far the best written of the series (as of right now anyways).  It contains a perfect mixture of action, intrigue, and drama.  All your favorite characters will have their stories advanced significantly, and there are some very intense &#34;WOW!&#34; moments.  The entire series is amazing, but this book really takes things to a new level.  If you've made it through books one and two, you will absolutely enjoy book three.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is an amazing series. Our family is absolutely loving it and can't wait for Season 3 & 4. Interesting to see historical changes from the other side of the pond.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|This show is definitely my favorite on television right now.  The murder mysteries themselves aren't top-of-the-line, but the humor and chemistry between the characters is what makes Castle great.  If you haven't seen the series, check out the first few episodes.  If you're a series fan, season 5 is another great installment, worth picking up.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have truly enjoyed this book/series.  It is so well written, the first person present tense really creates a sense of urgency within the story.  I love Katniss' complexity and her strength.  I will continue to read and re-read this series.
B003QSMCKO|4.0|Mulan is a Disney classic, great for the whole family and still a fun watch when you're an adult.  It's cheesy and corny and everything you'd expect from a kids movie, but still a great time.  If you haven't seen it yet this is definitely one to add to your list.
0307389839|3.0|I chose to read this book as I was looking for running inspiration, and remembered that some years ago a doctor friend of mine had recommended this book to me. Admittedly, I'm not familiar with Haruki Murakami, but through listening to this book I learned what an accomplished and celebrated novelist and translator he is both here in the US and in Japan. Along with being a successful novelist, he is an avid marathon runner and triathlon competitor. He seemed to fit the bill for the running inspiration I was looking for, and was hopeful this book would put into words what it is about running that just makes runners tick. Running is part of who I am and that's hard to explain to other people. Unfortunately, this book didn't deliver on that front. Murakami was miserable for most of his runs, couldn't come to grips with getting older and never patted himself on the back at the end of a race (despite completing 20+ marathons!). I'm all for humility, but not to the point of refusing to celebrate your own accomplishments (like running from Athens to Marathon all by yourself) and realizing that even if you don't meet goal times, you still got out there and gave it your all both mentally and physically which is more than most people in this world can say. I think most of his negative disposition stemmed from his Type A personality. Type As can be extremely hard on themselves and Murakami is proof positive of that. Anyway, it was an interesting albeit different personal experience with the sport of running. Although it didn't inspire me in a running sense (I enjoy running so much more than he seems to), I am interested in reading some of his novels. I feel like I know who is now and am intrigued to see how that plays out in his fictional works.
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|Great film about unlikely friendships, resiliency, love and character, and the real heart of people. Only downside was the subtitles.
B008PZ69T8|4.0|This story not only gives you the titilation you are looking for, but gives you characters you can get involved with. We can only hope that at some time E. L. James picks up her pen again and writes from the man's point of view.
B00B7G3NFU|1.0|We generally like character study films, but this was not really about the people but more about fulfilling a sexual fantasy. Can't recommend at all.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Character driven is what I like and you certainly get involved with these characters. Each one is well rounded and the dialogue is snappy.
B00ALYY6ZA|3.0|After reading this book, I decided this diet was not for me!  Just didn't understand why this was a healthy way to diet!
B009AMANBA|5.0|except for Sally Field  a i on in or ire at ah as i a no on it to as
B008AK8FHM|2.0|This was such a hard book to get into...., I gave up after the 1st ninety pages, too many explanations and big words that I had no idea what was being said!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|If you've ever thought about writing and publishing your own book Kindle makes it easy for anyone with opposable thumbs. This book is simple and laid out well, and will really inspire you to see that with a little gumption, focus and belief in yourself you can get your book on Kindle. The hardest thing about Kindle is just learning how to format it properly and how to upload it once you are done. But once you get it the first time, then the subsequent books you'll publish are easy. You are going to publish more than one won't you?
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book keeps you reading through out its entirety but sometimes I disliked either character.  I guess your supposed to feel that way. You never quite know what or who to believe but then that makes the story. It seemed more outrageous as the pages went by but it is a book one can't put down as you've got to know the ending. It's entertaining and that is worth something.
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|I purchased the Bluray of this movie, due to the fact that my uncle had borrowed my DVD several years ago and somehow lost it. I honestly believe that he actually did not lose it, he just liked the movie so much that he decided he would keep it. I knew I could not live without having it back in my collection, so since he happens to be my favorite uncle, I let the issue fall, and ordered myself the Bluray.<br /><br />I am very pleased as the movie's beautiful imagery is so much more breathtaking in Bluray, and now I will have it longer into my life as my husband and I are slowly transitioning all of our players to Bluray anyway.<br /><br />A basic synopsis for anyone who is not looking for a hard core review of the movie is this:<br />The story follows a man who has waken up at the wrong time, only to find out that the world he lives in isn't what it seems. It is actually being run 'behind the scenes' so to speak, by a race of unknowns who have different abilities. He teams up with some others who no longer wish to live in this highly controlled world, and attempts to overthrow the 'leaders'. He discovers many things throughout the course of the story, and I will not go into those as I do not want to spoil it for anyone who has not seen it.<br /><br />I love this movie and have since the first time I saw it. It is probably not appropriate for children, as the rating will explain, and I will not let my 5 year old son see it until he is in high school for certain. Not only for the adult themes, but also for the fact that it is a very interesting mind-twist world that he may not be able to wrap his head around yet.<br /><br />If you like fantasy and things that mess with your mind, this is definitely the movie for you!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Love all the travels and backdrops of each state.<br />Great work Quentin! Yes I liked the entire cast.<br />Yo Djangooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
1932907009|5.0|I'm about to embark on a screenwriting script.  Not only did Save the Cat reveal what I was doing right but what I was doing wrong and what to do to correct it.  Save the Cat is EASY to read and understand and reveals clear cut pointers to make a script a winner by applying the same techniques used by the big screenwriters.  Soon I was looking at every movie and able to identify many aspects of it.  Simply great!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Extremely well written. Totally worth it! Looking forward to Day Two! I highly recommend to all fantasy enthusiasts. A great read.
B00881PTRC|3.0|I mean I expected a little more in the graphics..but ok I guess for the type of game, pretty cool tho..
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I liked this book and I read it in 2 days. I thought it was a little predictable, but I still liked it. It wasn't as good as Gone Girl, but that book was awesome, so I guess you really can't compare them.
B007PKSN6Q|4.0|This is the music from when my wife and first met and got married.  Brings back some great memories from the 80s.
1400069289|4.0|This is an interesting book, but not exactly what I expected.  Recommend it, but not highly.  First 3 chapters on habits and how to change, the rest about habits shaped different corporations and other entities.
B0073TZ1AA|3.0|First off this is a great idea for an app, unfortunately the voice is quite annoying. But I still intend to keep this program to read over my short story's. So I can tell if there are many mistakes and because anything longer would be defined as torture under the Geneva convention.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Reads the pdfs I have perfectly.<br />Well written almost flawless execution.<br />Can change the voice through IVONA TTS if your not using a kindle fire.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Super annoying voice.<br />Has no tutorial.<br />Has some reading issues like it reads frames as \\"vertical bar\\".<br />Interface is poorly written<br /><br />Honestly if it where not for that annoying voice tearing away what sanity I have left at 1 am this would be an amazing app. But its best use might be proof reading something you have written as the annoying voice makes you pay attention. So for now it gets 2 stars if they choose to upgrade the voice I will revisit this and upgrade my review.*update 4/30* if your on something other then a kindle fire you can upgrade the voice through IVONA TTS(which you can download off the google play store). For someone off the kindle fire I would give this program a 4 star. But as I am still on a kindle and it still driving me batty, ill only upgrade my overall review to 3 star as I understand some people are not on a kindle.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|This is a prime example of how science fiction movies should be done. I had the LOWEST expectations watching this movie, but I am not only surprised, but pleased to say this movie is Well Done. J J Abrams is a very sharp, detailed director and I am eagerly interested to see what he does with the upcoming Star Wars Episode 7 movie. Chris Pine definitely was the right choice to play James T Kirk. Zachary Quinto really wowed me as well with his performance as Spock. Eric Bana did well enough for me to enjoy his performance as Nero; the only gripe I have with him (and this movie) is I feel his character was underused. I especially enjoyed Karl Urban as Bones. Zoe Saldana was very convincing as well as beautiful in her role as Uhura. The story line is very thrilling and entertaining. To describe the movie itself: brave, daring, bold, adventurous, funny, enjoyable. I also liked the sound quality this movie has; something that often is overlooked in my reviews. I was completely astonished at how much I actually like this movie. To end this review on a positively high note, On May 17, 2013 A movie called Star Trek: Into Darkness will be released. And I Myself will be buying movie tickets to see this particular film. As for Star Trek, My final closing remarks will be: Finally, another Great science fiction movie.<br /><br />4 stars
0385361661|4.0|This book could be a bit absurd at times, but it was so much fun! It was a little bit slow to start for me and I wanted to smack Lottie a few times in the very beginning for acting so stupidly.  She is a pretty typical Kinsella character and this book felt comfortable to me, giving me exactly what I expect from a Kinsella book. It wasn't one of my favorites but I still enjoyed it very much. (The only Sophie Kinsella books that I did not enjoy are the Shopaholic books.) I alternated between listening to this on audio and reading it in print and both ways were equally enjoyable.  One thing that I found particularly enjoyable about the audio production was that it was read by two different narrators-- one for the Lottie chapters and one for the Fliss chapters. The story is really about both sisters and I really liked that about this book. This is typical chick lit, romantic comedy fare and was a pleasure to read.
1568363931|5.0|I haven't even come close to making all of the bentos in this book, but the ones that I have have been a huge hit with my husband, who is a picky eater in the sense that he gets bored easily. He likes a lot of variety. This books has delivered that. I love how the recipes are organized by time. I'm still getting the hang of it, but as an introduction to bento, this was perfect for me.
B00942G4UA|5.0|very good and informative and sad about the poor animals also it may make me become a vegetarian and not eat meat anymore
B00846REIS|5.0|Thank God, I was laying beside the pool when I read this hot novel.  Sylvia Day has got it going with the H & H in this book.  I was really looking for something to get me over my 'I am done with my 50 Shades Blues.'  This book did it.  I am not taking away from Sylvia's just desserts - she is an awesome writer every bit the caliber of E.L. James.  I will read anything she writes!
B007PVHANM|5.0|I watch this movie and brought back old memories, I felt like I was in Jamaica visit the Marley family. If someone want to know about Bob Marley's life then I should highly recommend to watch this movie because it covers every part of his life.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was hooked from the first page. Inspiring! I thought the writing was very clever and will definitely read other books by Suzanne Collins.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|not a lot of excitment,  but i love playing this game in real life.  Granddaughter thinks she's really doing something and enjoys the noise the game makes.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|What has been done to children by cruel and evil people needs to be woven not only into fiction but also into our hearts so that it can be erased for all time.  The characters were believable and sympathetic.  They were well developed as was the plot.  I loved the humor of the situations juxtaposed with the drama of Jamie's very understandable depression after his adoptive uncle dies and he finds himself alone again.  Lydia is experiencing the same detachment and need for belonging.  A very good read.  I loved this book.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|I loved this movie. I was lucky enough to find it in a theater playing  first. I prefer watching it in its original language than English however as it just sounds awkward for some reason in English. That being said the action in this movie is non-stop. I loved how much fighting and martial arts was used here. Its a good movie without many special affects. I would recommend this to all my friends.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|Bought this movie before it went back into the Disney vault. Goes great with our Disney 3D collection. I would recommend.
B0081KTHEQ|1.0|Too bad I never got to watch it.  Amazon instant video sucks!  I have a high speed internet connection and could not get this video to play worth a dime.  I also didn't fully understand that I couldn't completely download this movie to my computer and since I don't own a Kindle Fire, I can't download it there either.  So I'm stuck trying to stream a movie from my 'video library' that will not stream.  Worthless service.  I am completely disappointed in this particular Amazon service.  Usually Amazon is great, but in this case they stink.  If I could give zero stars i would have...  Will never use this again.  I should've stuck to my iTunes...
B0072X2O66|5.0|anything mike portnoy his involved with i just have to have it. his new band is assume. his drumming is suberb as always. and his sound his the best. glad i picked this one up also. thanks again
B0070UFMOW|5.0|I love this DAC.  At first I was using it solo, which I still do when I'm not at home, but I recently paired this with an E9k(the desktop amp/dock)  The sounds quality with these too is amazing.  I have a pair of Sennheiser HD650s which I used to plug in to a Pioneer receiver.  They sound so much better with the DAC/Amp.  I would highly recommend both of these products.
B00B8PRDHE|5.0|been a huge fan of ringo and his all-star bands. this one is the best one yet. with the lineup he has on this tour it really is one of his best yet. thanks again
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game It is my favorite game I recommend u buy it I know it's stupid it costs so much but it's awesome
B007B5EDEG|5.0|Best series I've ever read! Don't be put off by the amount of characters or pages, this author is amazing. Something here for everyone and I can't wait for the other books in the series to be published. Many people love the TV series but the books just offer so much more. So detailed and interesting, plenty of twists and turns and no waffling.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Yes temple run is pretty cool but if you are going for a more colorful game of<br />doges this is perfect for you or your child.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|I really love this movie, amazing cast with great performances especially Lawrence, se completely owns the movie. Cooper was a revelation.
B006VFLIYK|2.0|Not the best I have read by this author. I got lost in the shuffle of the whole plot. I am disappointed with this book, but I will definitely read more of his works when I can research a bit.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You should get the game,I meen,it does not have all the blocks but it's good gameplay.The mobs are. zombies,skeletons,creepers,spiders,but BEWARE, I saw HEROBRINE so be careful oh and its hard to get a full set of armour.and that's what I think about the game
B0000696I0|5.0|This film is basically the genesis of Nash's career. Before he had a legendary run as Diesel, before he changed the world in the nWo, before TNA. Man, this film is iconic simply because you got Nash as Super Shredder. Dude crushes the Turtles but comes up short at the end. Vanilla Ice is pretty killer. Splinter is a bit of a dick.<br /><br />It's the sort've flick where you'll pull for the bad guy (no pun intended Hall fans) if you knew it was Big Sexy underneath the mask. WOLFPAC!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|You can't even look up a word. You have to go through every page to find what your looking for.
1401322425|5.0|Between the delicious recipes, beautiful photos, and focus on gardening I have read and used recipes from this book over and over since I purchased it in 2009.  Thank you Jamie Oliver for taking us into your garden and kitchen and in the process inspiring me.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I needed something to help me check my child's work on the go.  Very helpful tool since I didn't have any paper on hand.
B006O6F932|5.0|My girls are obsessed with monster high and this school house  is a blessing in disguise. They enjoy playing with the monster high dolls longer now
B005ES1FBQ|4.0|Nice crocs, like the color, but a little too large. Should use a size 8 1/2, however not available. Keeping the shoes anyhow,<br />maybe my foot will grow!
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Really like the complete series of these...Andy whitfield was taken to soon and in his passing this series is going to be timeless!
B00C10N3EW|5.0|Honestly I was skeptical about a live acoustic album let alone a double album. Joe is such a good electric guitar player I wasn't sure it would keep my interest. I was pleasantly surprised to be wrong. He brings feeling, emotion, and power to this performance. Would have never thought acoustic performance could be so \\"heavy\\" but man Joe (and the backing players) really bring it. I highly recommend this to any fan of his or anyone that likes blues.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Love this series of Sparticus. Not recomended for kids to watch at all with all the nudity and violence but this series hit the wow factor for me !
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|After 40 years of yoyo dieting and not even trying for the last eight... I have hope again.  Have lost 12 pounds in 4 weeks.  But am doing much more than the book recommends.  Amazingly... once I fasted... I got control over my apetite.  Now I am eating healthier and doing more exercise.  This book was the &#34;jump-start&#34; I needed.

B00957T6X6|5.0|This has been the most thrilling 5-book bundle I have ever read.  Can't wait for book 6 to come out.  I hate that some of my favorite characters didn't survive the story.<br /><br />Please hurry with the next book..
B00AIBZM40|4.0|this review ia made on the blu ray disc of the movie, as follows-<br />movie - 4 / 5<br />video - 4 / 5<br />audio - 4.5 / 5<br /><br />had lots going from the start, but it sort of fizzled out towards the end.<br />very dark, mostly colorless movie, couple of scary parts in between.<br />should have been a lot more scary but wasn't.<br />own it if you must, but a rental at best.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|great time killer. love the challenge. beautiful graphics but potentially expensive with extras but you can earn the extras with time.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I hate reading sequels, I'm usually disappointed in the additional drama & relationship problems that need to be worked through. This story starts a little slow, definitely some growing pains for Gideon & Eva. Eva seems to lose herself as she gets closer to Gideon, we don't always see her feisty side that we love. She seems to be more needy & emotional. Gideon has moments when he is a total sweetheart & then his mood switches & he is a total jerk. Eva's stepbrother is still an issue & Eva is also dealing with Cary after a terrible accident. Gideon spends more time with his ex-fiance & it strains his relationship with Eva to the breaking point. But if you hang on, be patient because the story really comes together about 3/4 of the way through the book. Gideon's mood swings & extra-curricular activities are explained & we fall in love with this couple all over again. More importantly they fall more in love & hopefully overcome their pasts to become an even stronger couple!
B000FBJFSC|2.0|Started book.  Print is in 2 different fonts.  Some paragraphs are repeated and some are missing.  I never had this experience before, it's very distracting.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I can't believe I bought this book knowing that our main characters are seniors in high school. But seriously, this book is phenomenal! Sky & Holder each have issues from their past that have nothing to do with their young age & you see them work through these demons & surprises from their past which pull them closer together, making them form the sweetest bond imaginable. I love how Sky has been numb with other boys and doesn't quite know why until Holder comes into her life. The twists & turns in this story are mind blowing, heart breaking, incredibly romantic & sweet. I can't recommend this book enough - it is beyond amazing and I seldom do this...but I'm going to read it again, it is that good! Even knowing what the surprises are in the story, I want to experience it all over again.
B008PWUYVA|3.0|The case is nice, but the velcro fastener tore loose from the cover , so it won't fasten closed. Otherwise, it is good.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Fell in love with the entire series! Love MacKayla & Jericho & can't wait to read more books by Karen Marie Moning. Best paranormal series in the world!
B0011UGLK6|5.0|Recommended by my mom, a collection of short stories of various Bengali Indians and their travels between India and America. The characters are very human, compelling. In just a few stories Lahiri paints a broad picture of how many different kinds of experience this people has in America, how many different ways of adjusting and becoming (or not) part of the american culture there are for bengalis.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|What an emotional journey to take with James and Lydia! Well written and catching book about the ups and downs of life in relation to our childhood. Loved it!
159413586X|5.0|I couldn't put the book down....as well as the first two.  The storyline is so different and unexpected that it held my attention from start to finish.  I would definitely recommend this to others.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is not the best city building game out there but it is close.  It moves along at a quick pace.  Very addictive.
0385341008|4.0|This story gave quite an insight into the lives of those who lived through the war.  It made me appreciate the freedoms that I sometimes take for granted.  I would definitely recommend this to others.
0307944689|4.0|Easy to read book, I am still reading it. Just the book is not enough to get ready for the test. I would recommend to go to a website to find a TOEFL test to practice for free. This book comes with a CD with MP3 format listening assignments, no more than that.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|A fun little game. Keeps you on your toes when going on safaries and try to catch the animals. Just a fun game  to keep occupied proxies zoo
1452115567|5.0|Maddie and Theron are true inspirations. The bond that they share is priceless. Theron has achieved what so many want to achieve and that is that ability to do what you love! Lovely photographs: creative and heartfelt. A must buy!!
B00BR9S8C0|4.0|Classic differences between men and women that everyone should understand. Will save you and your significant other a lot of arguements!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I would tell my friends to play this game because I like it so much I even play it on my kindle so I can play it more then just on Facebook
B004AYCWY4|3.0|I enjoyed immensely Richard Dawkins' previous books: 'The God Delusion' and 'The Selfish Gene'. His mixture of hard science and instructive reasoning has clarified not only scientific questions, but philosophical ones as well, putting paid to proponents of intelligent design.<br /><br />With 'The Greatest Show on Earth', I fear Dawkins has descended into pulp writing. Having run out of genuinely new and intelligent topics, backed by research and science, this semi-philosophical foray doesn't answer the questions posed by the book's title. There are elements within the book that are instructive, but Dawkins has used it as a personal pulpit to browbeat his opponents.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game. Cant wait to collect free coins everyday. Best bingo app out there!!! Would recommend to all bingo lover's!
B002BWP49M|4.0|This series was one that possibly a portion of the world waited for each part to come out. And then watched over and over. This household waited and watched, then waited for the next one. It was habit forming, watching and waiting. Each leading to a grand finish. It was all worth waiting for to see the conclusion of this series. Once you've watch one you will be hooked, to see what happens next. Save yourself the wait and purchase not only this part but all of the series. You won't be disappointed. Buy today. Get you some popcorn and drink of your choice, place the movie into the player and enjoy!!!
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|I have found that the book is better for me in most cases. However, sometimes it's good to see the movie first. That way one isn't always finding what is not congruent with the book. The Hunger Games movie was good. Maybe I am just too logical about things. Maybe I just like more detailed explanations of a background. Okay so everyone revolted against &#34;The Capital&#34;. Then they were all punished by participating in &#34;The Hunger Games&#34;. How does the rest of the world fit in this? How can the elite and sophisticated just sit back on their technology and despotism and not only allow such barbarism to happen but glorify it. I can see the author's point she is trying to get across. In the United States, we do live in a very top-down society in which &#34;The Capital&#34; or the top 1% has most of the wealth and power. Maybe &#34;The Capital&#34; is supposed to be capitalism. If one can look past a lack of historical background and the exaggeration of modern society, it is a good movie. I agree with the message. I don't understand why 1% must keep it all to themselves while there are children starving on the streets.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I liked the book because, I was hooked from the beginning and wanted to know what happened next or what was coming next.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|I got this for free but it was still disappointing. I do not believe it said anything in the seller's description about only being able to play a couple of games before paying for it.
B000JQU4TW|5.0|What exquisite prose that Oscar Wilde employs to narrate a metaphysical tale of crime, greed and conscience. To weave such a deep and though-provoking narrative into a wildly entertaining tale bereft with amazing dialogue and such rich characters is amazing.<br /><br />This is a book that will enrich anyone who wishes tone entertained or have their curiosity and intellect piqued!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Phenomenal show - great storyline, intelligent dialogue, wonderful acting, and something for everyone. I love the action and the &#34;game&#34; that the main characters play. My girlfriend enjoys the character development and the love interests.
B00000F0D1|5.0|Love Kathy Bates' performance. I had always heard about this movie<br />and now I can honestly say I've seen it and LOVE IT !!
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I chose this rating because this book speaks the truth. Practically all successful people have utilized The Secret. They might call it something else, but the teachings are the same. The only thing I disliked about the book is not knowing the teachers of this book. Would've been nice to hear teachings and stories from more well known/mainstream successful individuals
B0006Z2KIY|5.0|Words can't convey how much I loved this movie.<br />I don't want to spoil the movie for those who haven't watched it.<br />All I will say is WATCH IT.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Lovely read . Great classic. I love this author. Highly recommended book. Can't wait to read more by this author
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It's been a long time since any book has kept my attention until the hunger games. I read all 3 books. I truly dreaded the end because I enjoyed them so much.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Nice, slick fast app... at first was going crazy couldnt get the app going, but after playing with my phone so much I GOT IT
140191716X|5.0|Whenever I pick up this book, I'm transported to another world.  (There's another version of this book, which I also have, but this is the better version of the two.)  There's something about the color and artwork that make you forget about your troubles.  The words are phenomenal as well - great, practical advice.
B00BYKIKJS|4.0|I thought it was a good movie. I love the relationship between the two main characters!! Must see movie for sure!
B0086449YA|5.0|I love all of Mark Knopfler's music but this might be his best. Awesome variety and quality of music. I just wonder why it took so long to be available in the U.S.?
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|I'm disappointed not with the game itself as with the adds and also my controls don't work very well at all..other than that it's a pretty game... need improvement...
B0066W1AZK|5.0|im so happy i let my three year old play it and he is doing algebra. I bought a kindle for everyone I know so we could all play this game
B0063M22QO|4.0|Far more variety, levels, and challenges than any of the free Mahjong Solitaire games I tried; I've deleted all of those! Have only had this one about a week, so hesitant to score five outta five (stars, that is!); will see how i feel about it in a few months!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|As with the later episodes of Season 2, each episode seems to end with a cliff hanger. The endings are also teasers for the nest episode, effectively acheiving continuity for the series. Too many of the cast are dying much to my sorrow; but, in an apocalyptic world, can I realistically expect anything less. This is horror at its best and is very artfully done.
B00B1MSKJO|5.0|Everything is very good quality and the vinyl sounds great. Much better than the pressings by Plain Records from 2008.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|That was probably the best book I ever read. I loved Sal through the book. I can't wait to read more Rebecca Stead books.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Loving it!  Takes me back to my grade school days.  Now comes the real dilemma....do I tell my children I listen its on my kindle or keep it to myself?
B009AMANBA|4.0|All the accolades for Daniel Day-Lewis in his portrayal of Lincoln are well-deserved.  He really is as good as you've heard.  He completely transforms himself into Abraham Lincoln and captures the many sides of a complicated man and President.<br /><br />The film itself is quite engrossing - especially when you consider it is essentially a 2-and-a-half hour movie about Congressional vote wrangling (and one where the viewer already knows the final outcome).  Credit goes to screenwriter Kushner, who has managed to capture the import of the vote and the subtle ways in which Lincoln could cajole and arm-twist using his resolve, his humor, and his natural charisma.  After watching this you will really feel as if you know Lincoln the man better than you ever did through a history book, and that is high praise for any biographical film.<br /><br />My only quibble is with the ending.  The film ends just after Lincoln has been assassinated - I doubt that qualifies as a spoiler - and I wish there was a little more time devoted to this.  It is passed over so quickly that Lincoln's death has little emotional impact in the film... Instead there is a brief flashback of Lincoln delivering a speech, and then the movie fades to black. My suspicion is that Spielberg was trying to focus on his tremendous accomplishment in abolishing slavery, which would far outlive his mortal life and in a sense lessen the tragedy of his death.  I just felt that this great man's death deserved a little more import in the film, and it made the ending somewhat unsatisfying.<br /><br />At any rate it is an excellent film and definitely worth watching for Day-Lewis's amazing performance.
1781164266|5.0|i saw this book at Frank n Son in City of Industry, Ca......and fell in love with it! Love the art work. a must have for all fans of the game series.
B007G51UV0|5.0|PROS: Everything works! (That is definitely a pro considering how many DOA's I've read about)  WiFi works flawlessly (I only installed the driver- not the 'GO' feature) as does all the USB connections.  I see a previous reviewer mentioned the issues with the WiFi, perhaps it has to do with the \\"WiFi GO!\\" software... I didn't need that service so I just installed the driver and it works perfectly and is FAST.<br /><br />CONS: UEFI boot issues!  I flashed the newest bios upon receiving the motherboard and the system installed WinXP (for dual boot) flawlessly... but when I went to install 64-bit Win7- it would only take me to a \\"Boot Manager\\" screen and would not allow me to proceed. No matter what boot settings I changed in the bios (I even tried four other sata drives with the same result); this includes setting the secure boot to Other OS, selecting compatibility mode, etc... NOTHING.  I finally flashed to a bios that was over a year old (before everything switch to a priority for Windows 8) and was able to install Win7 without a hitch.  After installation I flashed back to the newest bios and the system works great.  Just a major PAIN for those who still want to install 64-bit Win7 on MBR drives.<br /><br />Overall I am very happy with this motherboard.  I always hold my breath when I put together a completely new system- so many components, so many places where things can go wrong.  Thankfully I was one of the lucky ones who had all the components (so far) work perfectly; other than the issues installing Win7 as noted.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This is a freaken awesome collectionof formats. A must have for your 3D blu-ray library. plus the movie is fun to watch if you have to entertain friends or family.
B0002UOK04|5.0|Wintersun is one of my favorite metal bands - this cd has lot of good songs, but my favorite is Sleeping Stars, this is such a great song I can't hear it enough - it's the most unforgettable melody and the way the voice and the instruments blend together is amazing . Their other cd Time 1 is also I think a little better all in all, but all the songs on here are all really good
B00A85EMVK|3.0|its great that it was released in 3D, but it just wasn't all that great. worth the 20$ i paid.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|the variety of main charecters and minions is outstanding I love the gameplay I cant waight to see if there is going to be a third one
B008518MOW|5.0|Owned the frist 2 movies..........had to pick this one up as well. good freature! great sound quality. over all, good movie!
B00936A0RU|3.0|Found this movie to be too tvish. Not much of a storyline even though it's supposed to be based on a true story.
B009MO5G90|5.0|Once again, Huge fan of the RE game series, had to get this one aswell. Come on people!!!!!, its Resident Evil!!!!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Been using the desktop and web and mobile app for a while. Excited it works on my mobile devices too.
B002ZG98UK|5.0|i'm a huge fan of the games. so why not buy the movies. this movie wasn't the greatest RE movie to date but, still love the series.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|As with many typical, classic British programs, impressive and engaging cast and production!  I can't wait until Season 4!!  I hate to see it end.
B00A8LYYI0|5.0|after years of speculation, whether or not the movie was gonna be made.........it finally was. Saw it in threaters and it was a decent movie. Part one was way more exciting to watch. Worth the cost for a 3D blu-ray combo pack.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Can be a little monotonous but is still fun to play. Sometimes it does take a little longer to earn coins but as you progress through the game it does move along.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|I am a photographer, and this is a story about a photographer. And I did not realize that it is based on a true story. But most of all it is a true love story. Very well done, and touches our hearts. Again and again .......
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Someone else on here said that this reminded them of the PC Game Mist and I agree.  The only thing I would have liked better is if it had been longer.  It took me about a total of 4 hours to beat it without using any of the hints.  Still a super fun game though!  Definitely worth $2!
B00CATSONE|4.0|This is an interesting story about Tesla.  Also touches on his interactions with other notable figures from his era.  It seems to me the purpose of this work is to promote another of the author's books.  Still if you are fascinated by Tesla it is worth reading.
B006LEHOL2|5.0|Brilliant album, love all of it. Had just seen her live and I had to buy this. She has a terrific voice.

B0041KKYBA|4.0|revealing, thought provoking...should be required reading in seminaries and business schools in my opinion, or for those of us who like to use the occasional  term; 'compassionate conservative'
1601251556|5.0|We actually were using (before I bought this) the box of tiles that you can buy. We started getting bored of them and as a DM I was getting annoyed because if I wanted to particular tile set I'd have to go shell out 30-50 bucks. So we went old school and I invested in this mat and some washable markers. Everyone prefers this, over that anytime we play. I think you would too, so I would recommend this to anyone whose into table top gaming.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|I like action thriller (the ones that keeps you in the edge of your seat) as well as sci-fi and adventure movies
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My seven year old daughter started to play this game lest year on our ipad and loved it! But I put it on my personal kindle and started to play it myself. it is a really nice game to play... not too much thinking involved but there is some hand eye coordination in the game that is fun as well.
B00CEF014E|3.0|As a new writer, Damian Stevenson puts together a fast paced and frightening scenario. \\"Solstice\\" seems to pull from a number of common narratives we have all seen or read over time.  It is short so can be read quickly  and easily. I found some oddities through out it. When you heroine is running for her very life, she seems to keep her cat and carrier with her through it all. Doubt I could have managed that. Plus here is a woman who has just come out of a stint in re-hab and yet she has the power of Arnold  Swartzaneger and the athletic ability of a college wrestler. It is though, a thrill a minute and I believe that this \\"young\\" writer has some good potential. As its short and easy to read, you might want to give it a try!
B008OOYALE|4.0|Fun and addicting game. Just takes patience. I love the creativity that is in the game. Allot of different dragons to have and discover.
B00CAJP0ZO|1.0|To paraphrase Robert Ebert's (RIP) review of the movie Battlefield Earth, listening to will.i.am's album is \\"like taking a bus trip with someone who has needed a bath for a long time. It's not merely bad; it's unpleasant in a hostile way.\\"
0887307280|5.0|If you are a business owner or considering going into business for yourself, you must read this book! Makes you recognize you need to work &#34;on&#34; your not always &#34;in&#34; your business. It's all about systems, standards, and accountability.
B003AVPV1O|5.0|I was need this cable to run one camera dvr's to two 2 output monitors and this works very well.
0821221841|5.0|This is a great book to begin to understand photography as a whole. The technical aspects and scientific principles presented serve to create an understanding of light and perspective at an elemental level and thus negates the fact that it was written well before the digital age. In fact, I feel I came away from the book having a more well rounded thinking about photography because I learned how things used to be done. I'm looking forward to reading book 2 in the series.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I thought I would know the ending but it was a told shock. I did not know if I was going to read the third book but with that ending I have too...

B0060MYK7G|5.0|This show has me obsessed.  Made it through all episodes in just a couple weeks.  You find yourself rooting for the Borgia's even through all their corruption.  May not be historically accurate, but the story line is too good to pass up!
B00BD07SGU|5.0|Since the addition of vocalist Tomi Joutsen in 2005, Amorphis has gotten kind of a knack for consistency.  Though The Beginning of Times felt as if the band was faltering a little bit, there was no real cause for alarm as it's biggest fault just seemed to be overstaying its welcome.  Despite their questionable lead off choice for single (\\"Hopeless Days\\" - works in the album context but certainly not representative of it as a whole), Circle sees Amorphis setting the bar atop the previous high mark (of the Joutsen era) of Skyforger.<br /><br />Admittedly, my first few spins of Circle left me a bit disappointed but the album has grown on my like wildfire since then.  One of the first things you'll notice is the heavier bottom-end.  Whether this was the band's doing or producer Peter Tagtgren's, I'm not sure but it suits the band well.  The middle tracks (\\"Hopeless Days\\" and \\"Nightbird's Song\\") as well as the bonus \\"Dead Man's Dream\\" sees the usually more progressive band momentarily take a step back towards the aggression of their early days.  The \\"Nightbird's Song\\" in particular was a album highlight for myself, and I'd love to see them experiment with their aggressive side in juxtaposition to their quieter moments (the flute solo) in the next record.  The other thing I noticed upon subsequent listens is the slightly more accessible, and almost dancy-folk vibe in a few of the songs.  I'm certainly not complaining about this one either, because \\"Mission\\" has got to be one of the most addictive songs in their extensive catalog.  \\"Narrow Path\\" comes in pretty close behind it as well, with it's opening riff along with the ending of closer \\"A New Day\\".  Of course, there are a few future classic Amorphis tracks to be found here as well.  Opener \\"Shades of Grey\\", \\"The Wanderer\\"  and \\"Into The Abyss\\" are quintessential songs that any fan of the band will be enamored with.  All of which feature powerful, emotive choruses from Joutsen and infectious, unmistakably-Amorphis riffsfrom Esa Holopainen and Tomi Koivusaari.<br /><br />If you have liked any of the Joutsen-era Amorphis releases, it's a no-brainer that you will enjoy Circle.  Personally, I'd say it's their best of said era, but that will depend on your tolerance for the ever so subtle changes they have brought in this time around.  Don't dismiss it in a few listens as more of the same, this one is definitely like a fine wine and will improve with age!
B008JIFJ4W|1.0|Could barely finish this the first time i listened. Major let down as these songs mostly aren't good. I saw them live last month and these songs any better.

B000PC6Z48|5.0|A classic western. They don't make them like this anymore. This is how the west really was, tough and gritty.
B00811U0FK|5.0|As the previous reviewer stated, it's a figure of Nami as she appears fighting on Enies Lobby / against Califa. For the price it's pretty amazing, imo. It's very well sculpted, the pose she's in is nice and dynamic enough that she fits in fine just chilling next to her nakama holding or assembling the regular clima tact, and still looks ready to fight when the lightning effects are on. The paint job is nigh-perfect on the one I received, and she stands well with the clear plastic attachment provided and on her stand. Over all I'm very satisfied with it, and definitely am happy that I decided to go ahead and just grab the whole crew from the cheaper figuarts line rather than just one or two of the more expensive (they're amazing though, ofc, still) Megahouse P.O.P. line. The only complaint I have is that the winking face included looks dumb, I don't know if it's because of the face itself, or that it doesn't jive with the pose, but it just looks weird. I think you can see it in the pictures on the site though, so judge for yourselves - the figure is still well worth it without the extra face, in my opinion. I would definitely reccomend it One Piece or Nami fans, perhaps over the other Nami figuarts has on offer. Had the Toei and Funimation stickers and stuff too, and the box was perfect as well. Good Stuff!<br /><br />~Ruffian1~<br />(picked these up on my sisters acct. lol, not that it matters)

B0033TJATW|5.0|I love this product, there was no problems when I recieved it, and I will buy more very soon, thanks.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|Let me start by stating that I purchased this book by pure chance, you can even call it a mistake.  I'm not even sure what happened.  Normally I'm very careful about researching the books I'm planning to buy, reading the summaries and reviews.  Somehow this particular novel slipped through my careful screening process.  It's just so not my style.  This is a YA romance novel.  What I'm into is a hard core sci-fi operas, or end of the world (preferably involving zombies) kind of books.  So clearly this particular read is not really my thing.  However once I realized my mistake, I decided to still give it a shot. Take a break from my normal gory routine.  And about 15% into the book I was hooked.<br /><br />This novel is the story of love, death, and an amazing friendship.  It had some really amazing tender and happy moment.  And then there were heartbreaking moments where I surprisingly actually shed a tear.  I won't even cry when hordes of zombies kill off a planet.  But I full blown loose it because two lovers can't seem to find a way to be together.  This kind of reaction surprised me.  This was the point where I realized, that this novel might not be my thing, but the sweet captivating writing by Colleen Hoover made it all worth it for me.<br /><br />The only reason why I removed a star is because of somewhat still not fully matured writing.  I came to this conclusion even before I knew this was Colleen Hoover's first published novel.  I'm sure with time her writing will become better and more developed.  But this particular novel was not quite there yet.  Perhaps it was done on purpose for a specific target audience and I'm just very picky.  However for me writing doesn't deserve 5 stars.<br />Other than that however I believe this is a very entertaining and sweet romance novel.  And even if you are not into that kind of thing, trust me you are going to love it! Highly recommend!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I could not put this book down.  The writing style coupled with Shin's experiences make this book worth a read.
B005DOKL3E|5.0|I love the cover I can slip the kindle fire inside while charging to protect it, I can easily carry it in my purse.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I love this game it has great story and its has epic PvP and its just a great full worth the price
B0067TQQI8|5.0|This thing is awesome. I'm at a conference in a ballroom on the lower level of a hotel where there is almost no cell signal. My Z10 constantly searching for a signal combined with a lot of camera, twitter and Facebook usage is sacking the battery dry. So I've charged my phone from almost dead to filly charged twice and this battery pack is still 3/4 charged.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
B005K17RU0|2.0|used to depend on this app. then they changed the appearance to a weird narrow format.  might be okay on a phone but seeing 1.5 screens on kindle is stupid. need to revisit their mobile optimization.
0143122843|2.0|I could not empathize with the main character of the novel, nor could I really understand what the point of the story was.  On the surface, it is a murder mystery about finding a group of Czech underground members who are trying to assassinate Nazis and liberate Czechoslovakia.  But underneath that: What is the theme?  I have no clue.  It comes together as a rather \\"plug and chug\\" mystery novel where the main character suffers no self-doubt or emotion.<br /><br />There was too much Germans bad, Jews good, Nazis bad, Jews good.  The Nazis all came off as wooden, one-dimensional bad guys with no humanity.  And of course, to contrast that, anyone who was against the Nazis was an angel sent from heaven.<br /><br />I felt like I was listening to talk radio: one side is perfect in every way, and everything about the other side is evil.  Even Nazi food was portrayed as bad. Yes, the Nazi food was evil.  And Jewish food was holy.  Boring.<br /><br />I will admit that I only made it about 3/4 through the book and finally gave up and threw it away.
B000YJ85BI|5.0|Fun, never predictable, fast paced what every Sci-Fi novel should be.<br />The last in a great trilogy, I only hope there will be another.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I can't wait to read the next book so I can know what happens to all the characters.  George R.R. Martin kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next.  I was wondering when he would write about the other characters.  I'm never sure who is a main character.  He kills off some of the main characters and I'm never sure what's going to happen next.  I can't stop reading the books.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book put my faith back in reading again.  Too long have I stumbled through drivel and gratuitous sexual content.  This book is a wonderful read. I belly laughed out loud, cringed in parts and was, for once, completely surprised by the ending. I could see a movie the entire read, and can't wait for Christina McKenna's next work.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun way to pass time and keeps you coming back! The graphics are detailed and levels are more difficult than most seek and find games. The new quests keep the game interesting.
B00A6F9YFQ|5.0|These guys just cannot stop doing all things well.  And in their 50s they are still putting on a grand show in concert.  THank you.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Many times in the book I flipflopped between believing in his innocence and his guilt. This book is riveting and keeps you guessing to the end
B009715NUK|5.0|That is the best song yet.  rather touching i might add.  Pet Shop boys are the best no matter what .  Neil and Chris keep it coming.
B00633W614|4.0|In Jeffrey Archer's novel \\" The Sins of the Father\\" I was intrigued by a storyline that combined an historical background with a mystery based on old lies and deceit. It is a continuation of the saga of Harry Clifton who joins the Navy to escape a family secret and an ill-fated love affair. After his ship is sunk by a German U-boat he assumes an identity that will bring a harsh judgement and incarceration. This is a story of family fortunes and power, of betrayal and bitter-hatred, and of unconditional love and deliverance.<br />I loved the characters- Harry, Giles and Emma- each one memorable with a unique personality and courageous nature. Harry's a man willing to sacrifice his own happiness to ensure Emma's. He's intelligent, warm, and trusting which makes him vulnerable to those that would exploit his talent. Emma is spirited and determined; a woman deeply in love who sometimes acts before she thinks. Giles is loyal and brave but proud which leads him to make life-changing decisions that will bring him recognition but the loss of a friend. I enjoyed the twists and turns in these three lives which are intrinsically intertwined although torn apart by the chaos that's WWII. Even the ending left me wanting to know more and I intend to read the next book in the Clifton Chronicles. Jeffrey Archer is a writer who sees to the very soul of each of his characters, a formidable storyteller and this series well worth reading.
B003XSSR4W|5.0|Badfinger was the shadow of the beatles throughout the 70s.  This cd is their gift to the world and well worth it.  George Harrison was THE best guitarist and plays on the cd.  what a treat.
B008J05EL8|1.0|I got this so I could use MS Office products on my Kindle Fire, but I can't make it work, so it's useless to me.
B001GWK2MC|5.0|This is a great investment. My 2 yr old and 4 yr old love this toy. It's their bouncy house and their magical castle. Hours of fun
B007G51UV0|3.0|Pros: Nice board overall with lots of features. Ample room for future upgrades.<br /><br />Cons: Had to disable Wifi drivers per Aus support. I could not connect to modem or router with Wifi drivers installed.<br />I found the support site to be confusing and the Asus driver update page is a mess.<br />I installed updated drivers from the site and had to go to Intel site for one Lan driver update. This particular Lan driver<br />did not exist on the Intel site so Asus support suggested getting the driver that most closely matched. Big mistake.<br />Had to disable those drivers and re install original before I could get Network capabilities. Botoom line....my &#34;Wifi Go&#34; feature is<br />useless.
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|I deleted this.  At every turn there were glitches that would prevent you from properly playing.  The combat system is a little weird.  Little angle wings apparently show your units health.  Didn't figure that out until it was too late.<br /><br />After spending a good amount of time trying to build my base, i'd leave the game for a while waiting for it to generate, when I came back, stuff I was trying to build disappeared.  That's frustrating.
B0087EVHVW|4.0|Product is very fast and stable so far. Paired with Asus P-Z77 Pro motherboard, 16 memory, and<br />Corsair SSD.<br />Very qjuick compared to my old quad core processor.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Love the game it's fun and you can accomplish stuff with out spending real money<br />...my daughter and I play together
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|It's nice to watch a well-acted movie with a plot that hasn't been done to death.  The characters were fascinating and the scenery was visually stunning.  I truly enjoyed this movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Okay, so I'm not sure who enjoyed this book better, me, or my boyfriend!  But seriously, not only were the\\"romantic\\" scenes capturing, but the story line kept me turning pages as well!! As a single mom of three, and a full time CAN, I somehow managed to read this book in a day and a half,!!! Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to buy the other two books! Enjoy!!!!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I read this book  quickly,  great read for summer. Completely different than movie.  same thread but thats it. all details different.  I would definitely say read this book  even if you saw movie.
B00AQM8H9I|4.0|I got this as the free app of the day, but might pay a dollar for it. I actually quite like it and I think it's cute. Fun game. Not extremely difficult but there's a little strategy to it.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|It is the most fun app in the world. Its so beautiful.  I wish there were a thousand stars. I would have rated all a thousand stars.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Rented the movie from Amazon. Watched it with a lady friend of mine, and frankly, was embarrassed by the language. I know, I should have guessed it, but there was definitely more than a little profanity, only a little of it necessary to tell the story in my judgement.<br />  The story was based (very loosely, I would guess) on an historical event, although they must have used half a tankerload of white wash in giving Washington's side of the action.  Seems that covering incompetency with bull wasn't confined to Benghazi or limited to the current administration, I did see some parallels.<br /><br />  I would suggest renting it, keeping the kiddies away from the screen when you watch it, unless you want the little cherubs to go around saying &#34;ARGO **bleep** yourself&#34; for the next couple of weeks.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|game is alright ive played better seems at times for things to long to be created but battles are kind of cool
B006WQLH7G|3.0|I installed the Avast! on my Viewsonic G-Tablet. The G-tab does a nice job, but it was one of the earliest tablets available, and since the factory people completely ignore the fact they sold it, updates and refreshes just don't happen. So the tablet is running pretty much as it did when I unpacked it, except I added a 32 gig SD card to the 16 gig OS.<br />  I used Avast! on several of my laptops back in the day when I used Windows ( since have moved mostly to either Mac or Linux for laptops.)<br />  I downloaded and installed it. The product did a rapid scan, but after it was done, it seemed to slow things on the tablet down to a crawl. The processor is a dual-core Tegra. It handled AVG's anti-virus without any trouble, but clearly found something that slowed it .
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|I thought this movie was really good and would look forward to a sequel but it doesn't seem like one will happen anytime soon.
B004NEY9EW|3.0|Not a Bond fan. Haven't been for some time, since, I think the Welshman turned the keys to the Aston Martin DB5 over to Roger Moore.<br />  Having said that, Quantum of Solace had enough action to keep me interested, but many of the references and plot twists required a familiarity with the movie that came before it,  (as I was informed by the young lady with whom I watched this flick.)<br />  As a sequel, I guess it was necessary, but as a stand-alone, I wish I'd seen a bit of the earlier story first.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This Batman Trilogy was fantastic and my favorite by far was the Dark Knight Rises. There are a lot of great extra features and behind the scenes bonuses on these discs as well.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I rented the 'Life of Pi' on the suggestion of a lady friend of mine and her mother. Even though I didn't avail myself of the HD option, the video was breathtaking! Loved the pictures of the animals and scenery.<br />  The plot was not terribly difficult to follow. Boy and Tiger on a boat.<br />  Despite a simple plot, it managed to hold my interest throughout the movie. I even got a copy of it. I will watch it again.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Cute movie that anyone can watch. As an avid videogame player I thought this movie took on a unique perspective that other cartoon movies haven't really offered.
B000GWE44U|4.0|I remember seeing the movie when it first came out thirty years ago, and the opening shots of the car driving through the mountains still impress me. The Blu-ray transfer is pristine. I loved the camera movement, the music, the atmosphere but two things bugged me: I never sensed that Jack Torrance was ever completely sane, and that Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall was a couple, much less parents. No knock on them, but I thought they were miscast.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Predictable but an enjoyable enough, light breezy read. I enjoyed the two main characters and were definitely rooting for them.
B008IZYWXU|5.0|I blame this CD for the the music I constantly hear in my mind!! I play this over and over, and I never get sick of it!!<br /><br />I drive a bus on a remote mining site and have this playing all the time. Sometimes I forget to turn the CD down when passengers hop on, yet every comment I get is totally favourable. Many are stunned when I say it is Freddie Mercury from Queen. Even some die-hard heavy metal rock fans ask me to turn it up!!<br /><br />I gave the set to a friend recently for his 60th birthday, and his initial reaction was to turn up his nose. Different story now! When ever I pop in to see him, there is only 1 CD playing and it is this one!! He puts it on loud speaker when he goes out to mow the lawn on his ride on lawn mower, so that would have to be pretty loud! Silly thing is, he has converted his neighbours!!<br /><br />FANTASTIC CD set - love it......
B00AWBYA2G|5.0|This is a must-see for any lover of the Beatles and their music.  My boyfriend and I almost passed out from pleasure.
B0058SN2C2|4.0|I love these shoes very comfy and light. Upon arrival the one shoe was torn at one of the little half circle things at the toe....I had to super glue it....opposed to any return hassels...however holding up well....great shoe love them...will be ordering another pair!
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I enjoyed the anecdotes and stories. The theme applies to all women who have attempted to balance work and family. If readers look past Sheryl's status and focus on the fact that a huge disparity in pay and opportunities still exist in the USA due to society's perception of the role of women, which has resulted in many women being forced to lean back, we can start to move forward.
B000P0J0G0|5.0|Got it for my father.  This is one of the bits of comedy genius out there that everyone needs to experience.
B000063Y8F|5.0|The other brands would break and were disposable.  This is fantastic.  Five years strong and going!  Would definitely recommend it to those serious about crushing garlic.
B000K15VSA|5.0|His favorite movie, done up in a beautiful Voight-Kampff case... he should write this review because I will get all the good things wrong.  He loves it to death and can't stop going over the pieces, even years after I bought it for him.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Eagles. Farewell I Tour, Live From Melbourne.<br /><br />This two DVD album of thirty songs, plus the bonus feature of Eagles interviews, was recorded over the course of 14, 15, and 17 November 2004, at the Rod Laver Arena, in Melbourne, Australia.  The video and sound quality are top notch. The song selection includes the Eagles hits \\"Peaceful Easy Feeling\\", \\"Lyin' Eyes\\", \\"Tequila Sunrise\\", \\"Love Will Keep Us Alive\\", \\"Take It To The Limit\\", \\"You Belong To The City\\", \\"Heartache Tonight\\", \\"Life In The Fast Lane\\", \\"Hotel California\\", \\"All She Wants To Do Is Dance\\", \\"Take It Easy\\", and \\"Desperado\\".  The song \\"Rocky Mountain Way\\" contains some special mouth sounds possibly made by one of the band members inhaling from a tube a type of gas that changes one's voice.  Interesting.  This is one of those albums that you wish would go on forever. Watching it on a corner of my PC while doing other things, is much more interesting than listening to an audio-only CD.  Buy it.  The picture and sound quality will be infinitely better than any Eagles songs that you could watch on YouTube.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I always look forward to the latest John Grisham novel, a worrisome insight into the litigious USA and the world of mass torts.
B009AMANBA|3.0|Well, it was different.  I expected to be blown away with all that fine<br />talent.  Sally Field and Daniel Day Lewis are fantastic.  They were fantastic<br />in this movie.  I guess my impression of Lincoln as a person has always<br />been different.  Probably a good idea to watch it and see how you feel<br />about this portrait of one of our greatest leaders.
B00005JM02|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!! i'M A TOYS R US KID, and I will always be one, The DVD was in great condition
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Bought this for my husband and he is absolutely enjoying himself watching all these episodes.  Some he hadnt seen before.  What a treat!  Great transaction!
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|Disney is clearly not thinking about their customers.  This is the first 3d title they are releasing I will NOT be buying due to 3d and 2d versions being separate.<br />This is corporate greed, plain and simple.<br />Hopefully Disney will correct this error and follow their previous high value combo packs with BOTH versions<br />In the same package
B008OOYALE|4.0|I have been playing for about a month now and cannot stop. I make sure to play every few hours so I can see what I've hatched and grown. I love breeding different types and wondering an  waiting to see what kind of dragon they produce. The only downside to this app is there are numerous dragons and items that require an obscene amount of play gold to purchase. It is obvious that they want you to purchase the gold with real money and I would like I've done on other apps but it is not worth it. For $20, you would only be able to purchase 1 or 2 dragons.
B003YL4L0W|4.0|Of course, the kindle download went fine as usual.  Thanks you very much for such prompt service..  Yours truly, PAMELA SCHRACK
0394806220|5.0|This was one of my son's favorite books when he was a child.  Now his son (my grandson) who just turned one, can enjoy it too!
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Perfect!  Easy listening.  Would definitely recommend to friends.  Not something I would have originally chosen, but husband saw on a TV special and had to have... Great Purchase!
B009LMTDL0|3.0|Not all women are lucky enough to attend superior schools and have intern positions on Capitol Hill.  Her advise was helpful but sounded snobbish at times.<br /><br />Example;<br />Oh my!  while traveling on the corporate jet with children, blah, blah, blah.<br />Answer:<br />Never take your children on a corporate jet while on business!
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|Thought-provoking and just really entertaining. I love Jim Carrey, and I think this film is one of his best ever performances as an actor. He is the usual silly Jim Carrey, but within a context that is serious and quite tragic. That gap makes the plot a very interesting one, and I could easily watch the film more than once.
B00BAB6CNC|5.0|StoneSour has continually put out one awesome CD after another and they did not disapoint me this time,just another example of a group that knows how to rock.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|This is the epitome of \\"game as art.\\" The gameplay mechanics are about as simple as it gets, the visuals are unbelievable, and the soundtrack is fitting, moving, and amazing. It's an amazing game that you'll want to play more than once.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was just so much more than I was expecting it to be. It was pretty good from the start, but once it hit about the halfway point... It just blew me away. Everything was unraveling and there was connection after connection and revelations and surprises and holy crap I'm still trying to process it all. Go read this book if you haven't - there is a reason it has so many good reviews.. It's amazing and intense and has something for everyone.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A great continuation of the first book and a glimpse of the next one. I was fascinated by the thinking involved in this imaginary world.
1476719071|3.0|So I liked this book but the violence was concerning... Borderline abusive/obsessive. But that being said he never actually hurt her or anything so it sort of just became what their relationship was like... Hence beautiful disaster.. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and hope it would never escalate further. I did like the story though, and I liked learning more about Abby and her past and how it made her who she is now. I kind of have mixed feelings on the story, and there were some definite faults, but overall it kept me entertained.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read it over twice to be sure I didn't miss anything. Very pleasurable way of spending a weekend..I hope she writes more soon
0071766588|5.0|The book, and especially CD-rom, were excellent for helping me prepare for the TOEFL. It gave me a very realistic picture of what is expected and how to achieve best scores on the test. It is important to have practiced prior to entering the test.
B00992CF6W|4.0|When is the next up date? I would love to know. I heard that there is going to be rail road tracks and minecarts

B00ATU5JRA|1.0|Crappy. Did not work as advertised. They should pay me for my time to download it and then remove it. nuff said.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|Star Trek: The Next Generation was my favorite television series from the time it aired. And season three had some of the best episodes such as: The Most Toys, Deja Q, Yesterday's Enterprise, and The Best of Both Worlds, Part 1 to name just a few. By now, the crew has formed a noticeable camaraderie. This is science fiction at its finest with unique characters, exceptional stories, and great special effects for its time. I loved experiencing these adventures again, restored on blu ray. I received this season for review, but enjoyed so much that I had to go out and buy the previous seasons on blu ray as well. My favorite new addition was the featurette \\"Inside The Writer's Room\\" moderated by Seth MacFarlane.

B002LC2DQ4|5.0|So far it works as advertized. no other card provides pananrama features for the olympus camera. I am completely satisfied
B007U1FEJE|5.0|Hope some of you or your friends read these.  Don't want to get into the politics of two versions of the band touring (Mike, Bruce as BB; Brian, Al, separate tour); which none of your fans want.  It's getting late... you guys need to put any differences aside and get back to the studio to lay down as many great harmony tracks as you can.  Was pleasantly shocked how well the voices blended for the That's Why album; beautiful.  Although we miss Carl, the harmonies sound true, kind of mature, beautiful.  While everyone is still in solid voice (and great harmonies), there has to be tons of tracks you can lay down (from all contributors).  If not for you, for your millions of fans. It will last forever... Tim
B005FPT51K|1.0|This is the second ibaby M3 monitor we've purchased that does not work... THe first had internal problems (according to their tech-support).  We wanted to give the monitor a second chance, however, we are having the same issues the 2nd time around.  The set up SEEMS simple but never works... disappointed
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Hachi was a wonderful movie.  It was funny, happy and very sad, but any dog lover would fall in love with  the story and that wonderful Akita.<br />What was a little odd, was how and why the puppy was shipped to America, I wish that would have been explained in a bit more detail.<br />All in all, I loved it, laughed and cried.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|Good graphics. The multiplayer is great. The maps are big and there are a number of them. Gameloft are really  Good at these games. Top notch.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I've enjoyed every Mitch Rapp novel since the beginning and this one doesn't disappoint, as always the next is always better than the previous one.
B007I1QUYE|4.0|amazing
B0073TZ1AA|2.0|I was testing it out and had it read a bunch of different pdf files. It worked fine for a bit then all of a sudden it stopped reading the files out loud. Just nothing happened. I had to force stop it to get it to work again since it didn't seem to exit at all. It seems like it was running at all times until you restart the device or force stop it.<br /><br />I also am not sure why it needs permission to create or delete accounts on your device. I question the permissions it requires. Also it has you agree to a Eula on launch of the app. I didn't see anything obviously wrong with the Eula, just unusual for a app.<br /><br />I also did not see where others said they were selling new voices
B005FDXT32|5.0|classic
B004R6JG7G|5.0|Finally get to watch this in blu ray! I saw in theatres lately and nothing compares to this! Can see every sweat!
B0042RUMJG|5.0|This is a really good concert. If you want to enjoy your surround sound this is a great show. I believe Bose uses it in their showroom.
0062059963|5.0|I am so in love with both of Cass's books. They are by far some of the most phenomenal books I have read in a long long time and I CAN NOT wait until 2014. I have mentioned these books to all my friends and they all LOVE it too. We await the next book with anticipation.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|Hated it, kept watching hoping it would get better or have a descent end- it just got worse and ended as bad as it could get.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|I was really enjoying this when I got to level 29 and now it keeps taking me back to the tutorial and won't let me use my weapons.
B002AT4K9Q|5.0|Another update for my collection and I am glad that I was able to get this on Blu ray thanks.
1932100660|4.0|The book could have been shorter.  It was real interesting but seemed to repeat a lot of the same information but did have a lot of good information.  It went along very well with the 30-Day Diabetes Miracle book and cookbook I ordered.  I would recommend it to anyone diabetic.  I think we might be on to something that is working better than anything we have tried for my husband who is diabetic.  Hopefully will keep him off the insulin shots.  Seller was very fast about getting book to me and I would recommend them as well..
B00B69UQEO|5.0|I love most of the songs on there.  A few of them are a bit slow but you can figure out what they are.  Not a disappointment at all.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was a nice story, very short but nice to read for a weekend to relax from more serious reading.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I felt such sympathy for the amnesiac, it must be horrible to wake up every day and not know who you are.  Every time she remembered something from her past I was eager to keep reading so I could find out what happened.  I would suggest this book to anyone who enjoys any type of mystery.  Now that it's over I wish there were more!
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I really liked this book.it is a unique retelling of the Cinderella story with lots of twists and turns. It is well written and fun to read.definitely worth a try.
B008HTQ28K|5.0|Great book, masterfully told. Better than watching tv, and far more entertaining. Off to look for and download my next Grisham.
B00B0YL0E0|5.0|Like some of my fellow reviewers, I must admit that I was kind of late on the scene when it comes to Pretty Maids. I had heard a little bit of \\"Spooked\\" a few years back, but never really gave the band the credit, or the time they deserved. I stumbled upon \\"Pandemonium\\" shortly after it's release date, and was totally blown away. In my mind, the band had come leaps and bounds thinking back to what I remembered they sounded like. So with this in mind, I got rather excited with the news of an impending new release in 2013. Like many others, I found it hard to think that the band could meet the heights they had reached with \\"Pandemonium\\". It featured cuts that still remain permanently emblazoned on my mind, INVU, was definitely at the forefront of such epic tunes. In \\"Motherland\\" however, we see a further maturity in song writing, on issues the band tackle and in overall production. Melodies, hooks and heaviness are still very prominent, with a beautiful blend of all three. These guys can do a power ballad better than anybody and carry it off with ease. Just listen to \\"Infinity\\" and Bullet for You\\". The crowning glory however comes in the form of the title track. Not much to be said there, other than pure genius. Listening to this release, you still get a sense of hope that melodic rock and metal are very much alive and well, in a disposable world where music is such a throwaway, these guys shine a light and act as a beacon for those of us still hanging on to that sound which captured us in the early 90's. I won't go into \\"Motherland\\" track by track, it's a wholistic experience. I will however do some back catalogue searching myself, and give these guys the attention they now so desperately deserve.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|This book was like no other book I have read.  The sexual content was a little overdone but I enjoyed the book and watching the characters relationship grow.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Well we know why you are here.  You either saw the movie and love it, or you want to see it the way it was meant to be seen for the first time.<br /><br />This BD set does not disappoint.  The digital copy is already saved on my laptop, and I am watching the movie as we speak.  It is so amazing to have a 1080p HD TV that is actually being used to it's full potential.  The scenery is amazing, and just blows the mind.<br /><br />This movie does not feel like it had to be 3D, either.  It has moments where you know it was meant for 3D, but for the most part, it is just a pleasure to see the amazing scenery throughout this masterpiece. Not a movie relying on things just jumping out to scare you every few minutes, rather to enhance the Movies visuals.  Well played, Ridley Scott!<br /><br />If you like the movie (or are just a fan of Ridley Scott,) buy this set.  It is MORE than fairly priced, and the deleted scenes plus hours of extras, help to fill in the few gaps the movie seemed to have!  Buy this set!!
B008KEQMDC|5.0|I bought this movie after renting it twice. As soon as I got it, I watched it twice in two days! I love the pregnancy humor, and being in my third trimester with my 3rd child, I need a good laugh about the things that can really seem stressful during pregnancy and delivery. I wouldn't recommend this movie for children or teens because of the language and sexual humor. But I tell every parent, especially those expecting a baby, to see it. :D
B00422LESO|5.0|I just stayed up till 3am reading the rest of the story!!<br /><br />It's hard for me to explain why or how, rather, that I'm able to identify so well with this story. So I won't go into that. But I will mention that right now, I'm the exact age of the MC. That's new for me as I'm always reading YA. It was fun to relate in the here and now.<br /><br />I love the story of Pride and Prejudice. Honestly, my first introduction was the 2005 version. A dear friend brought over the BBC mini series and I fell even harder!! I've been an Austen fan for a long time. I've seen the films and loved them. I have a real liking for these stories. So this book was right up my ally! &lt;3<br /><br />I loved the wittiness of the MC. The story itself. The romance, misunderstandings, realizations of all kinds, the twists and turns. It was so great!!<br /><br />I had \\"feels\\"...I love it when a book has me all full of feels!! =)<br /><br />I don't want to spoil it. So I'm not saying much. Just know that I loved it. I cannot imagine Austen fans not enjoying it. So if you are one...pick it up! To me, it was original and fun. =)<br /><br />Happy reading!
0060837020|3.0|I would have giving the book 5 star because it was a really good read and i have read it several times. but i am judging it based off of the amazon used books trade. the book was in perfect condition but right on the cover was 3 pairs of breath right nose strips. i don't know who would okay that book for sale before taking those off, none the less ship it out like that. I am very disappointed in amazon for this and that is why they got 3 stars.
B0069JBKHI|5.0|Nice monitor with the possibility of panning in and out and changing angles of view from your iPhone. Lullaby is cute and good to fall asleep with. And you can speak with your child through the monitor while away.<br />The batteries should last longer though when not plugged in wall.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Great album, as soon as the offer was present, I quickly purchased this album at $9.99. Great buy, recommend it to any Fun. fans out there.
B008ODZUN2|1.0|Very slow and depressing.....I really can't say anything good or more about this movie. Don't waste your money on this movie.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|Sleepy inaccurate account. Great acting from daniel day-lewis and sally field but it lacked substance.  Not the \\"must see\\" film of the year
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I saw the movie and liked the characters portrayed by the actors.  The story line in the movie was true to Nicholas Sparks novel, a chick-flick and an enjoyable story set in a beautiful part of our country.  The book, like all of Sparks' work, was well written and believable.
0307389839|4.0|I have loved Murakami's writing ever since encountering Kafka on the Shore. His graceful prose, dreamlike reveries and descriptions of even ordinary objects and occurrences transfix me. But I was skeptical about a nonfiction memoir by Murakami; would I be disappointed by his musings about his real-life running and writing?<br /><br />Answer: No.<br /><br />As a writer and a runner, I have to confess that I had hoped for more tactical lessons in both topics. But Murakami is just as enthralling when writing about the exhaustion and exhilaration of long-distance running as he is when he spins a fantastical, hallucinatory yarn about a Japanese man in a Through-The-Looking-Glass search for his missing cat. And What I talk About When I talk About Running is not just about running; it's also a window to Murakami's creative soul. At heart, the book is about the writing process. For both runners and Murakami fans interested in how he works, this is a captivating read.
B000FBJFSC|2.0|I found this novel to be extremely depressing although it was probably realistic for the time period and location in Ireland.  I kept waiting for the redeeming light at the end of a dark and gloomy tunnel - it did not happen.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app it is sooooooooooooo much better than the first one but I don't like the sounds the peeps make the sound stupid
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this app, but it is missing one thing. It needs a concordance for those of us who would really like to study in depth.
B005OV1NME|5.0|This DVD is excellent in every regard. The orchestra and the singing are superb. The production, though slightly modernistic, was faithful to the text and enhanced the overall experience. This DVD deserves five stars.<br /><br />I am happy for the chance to review this version of La Forza. For a long time, it has had a \\"one-star\\" viewer rating --- based on only one reviewer! I fear many potential customers have been scared away from buying it. What was the negative reviewer's complaint?  The presence of cowboys and cowgirls in two scenes of the production. But these weren't American cowboys and cowgirls; they were Spanish. The opera is set in Spain. Spain has its own version of horsemen or \\"cowboys\\": caballeros. And their appearance in this opera does not violate the libretto or, in my opinion, the intentions of the composer.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I think its kid friendly but the one down fall is it wont let me invite friends it just Keeps saying wait 14 secends over and over but anyway other wise its ok oh and a other thing I'm giving it 3 stars cause its still a ok game aceppt it freezes sometimes but its ok I guess
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|well the app is good for picture taking but it suck because you cant record video ...so this should be a free app not $0.99 + tax.....so they should make a update with fix video recorder or give it free.
1439102430|5.0|i got my book today and havent put it down till now will more then likely stay up most to the night to finish it. when i get a book that can hold my interest like this i will read it several times more
B000K4WPCC|5.0|My husband has been talking about this movie since we met and and been dying for me to see it and i love it. very different then other movies similar to these..
B005C9YZIW|5.0|Outstanding! Amazing, Beautiful!, Must Have!!! No words cant describe it! YOU Must buy this!!! really love the image and stories!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|operates just like a hand-held. all the functions work as they should. very pleased with this app. now I don't have to hunt for a calculator.
B003PGNBNY|5.0|The disc and the case were in perfect condition! I really like watching and listening to the young stars sing.
0061906220|5.0|My niece wants it read over and over. She laughs every time. She has hundreds of books so this compliment is significant.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This season on DVD is excellent! It even has bonus features that are so interesting! Not a scratch on the discs, played perfectly.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|We found it to be a very good prequel to the Lord of the Rings series. We liked it and will watch it again and again.
B0073TZ1AA|4.0|When I first tried this app the voice was excruciating to listen to as many others have mentioned. However, in the description it says that it supports IVONA TTS. I decided to check out IVONA and see if that helped. I downloaded the free US and UK voices and they all sound pretty good.<br /><br />Unfortunately they are not available on the Amazon App store. If you have a device that can access the Google play store just search for \\"IVONA Text-to-Speech HQ\\", download it, then open it and install the voices of your choice - I tried the US english \\"Kendra\\" and UK \\"Amy\\" and they sound great and are free.<br /><br />After you download the IVONA Text-to-Speech HQ and the voices you want, exit all programs and go to your Android \\"Settings\\" → \\"Language & Input\\" → scroll down to \\"Speech\\" and tap \\"Text-to-speech output\\" → select \\"IVONA TTS\\" → then choose which voice you want it to use.<br /><br />This made a huge difference in the voice quality on my phone.<br /><br />Please note that this method will not work on the Kindle Fire - I even tried side-loading, but it would not work on my stock 1st generation Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Reads PDFs fairly accurately.<br />- Once you get a good TTS engine it sounds pretty good.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Text is cut off of the screen as it reads. If you are reading and listening at the same time this could be a problem.<br />- Individual words sometimes do not get separated correctly so that 2-3 words can be all together without any spaces between them.<br />- I tried to get it to read a PDF of a scientific journal article and it really had trouble figuring out the text: it would put only a few words or sentences on each page. It seems to do much better with just plain text.<br /><br />I think it is unfortunate that many developers do not keep up with releasing their apps to Amazon on the same schedule as the Play Store - the version here is 12.1 while the current version from the Play Store is 12.5. *Update*: I have been corrected on this - apparently the delay has to do with the review process and has nothing to do with the developers.rected on this - apparently the delay has to do with the review process and has nothing to do with the developers.
B000SJJCX4|5.0|I have been using this device for about 3 weeks and it works great.  Having the ability to tune up between songs and on breaks has given me alot more confidence that my instrument is ready to gol.
B004023FGA|5.0|My daughter loves personalizing her crocs with Jibbitz.....so these were great for her.  They run slimmer than the average Crocs clog and the back does not hinged up and down in the back.  So a wide foot will be a little tricky in this style.
0062119044|2.0|I did not enjoy this book. I thought the characters were unrealistic and the whole plot hard to believe. I gave it two stars since I actually read the book until the end. I thought maybe we would learn why the town turned against the mother. Early on you can basically deduce how the book is going to end. Mom basically thinks she has given birth to the antichrist but that doesn't stop them from giving him archery lessons instead of therapy. Dad is an utterly ridiculous caricature. Kevin convinced a child nursery school to scratch her skin off, took the wheels off of some kids bike,  but  hey, lets throw another baby in the mix and let him babysit!! Fantastic!!<br />This was one of those books where I feel like the author played a trick on us and is actually laughing at us for even reading her trash. Throw in a few insults to Americans and middle class parents, and Ms Lionel Shriver is laughing all the way to the bank.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Can't wait for the next chapter.  I finished this in a couple of hours but it was really engrossing and well made so for me it was worth the $2.
1475143389|5.0|There are a million fitness, exercise and weight loss books on the market. Not every program works for everyone, many are useless. We are all different, so you have to find what works for you. This book works for me and comes with one thing no other book of this type comes with. After I bought the book, I received an email a few weeks later from the author through amazon. He asked how is it going? Let me know if I can help. I have read the book twice and it is great for me. The book expanded my knowledge of fitness and today's science of fitness.<br /><br />The book was in line with many of my basic opinions about how to work out. I learned a significant amount about how to eat, when to eat and supplements. This book is so inexpensive, I highly recommend it to anyone. If you don't agree or don't connect with the concepts, give the book to a friend. I own 4-5 books on weight lifting and a few on fitness. This book is the most practical, simple and easy to follow.
B009VB97EY|3.0|Love Matthew McConaughey in this role!  Channing Tatum does a good job acting and dancing and is nice on the eyes.  The rest of the cast falls short, especially the actress who plays the sister of the newbie dancer.  Would recommend for easy entertainment.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|This is an action packed movie that starts strong and continues throughout the entire movie. A great movie set in Boston where it is a known town famous for its robberies. A stellar performance by all actors and actresses involved and is a must see!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|fun and slightly addictive game.  I would like more ways to earn pearls.  my daughter will love it if I ever give herbal turn.
B002ZG999U|5.0|A great movie set in the realm of mercenaries which is an action packed movie that is also filled with laughs.  A great cast of people who made this into a very enjoyable movie to watch.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Great for kids and adults alike. Wonderful on the Kindle Fire HD! The graphics are stunning and you'll find yourself learning things you didn't know.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I am big into military and I really love how Chris Kyle lays out this book in a way that is easy to understand!  This is an eye opener into the lives of those who sacrifice so much for the many awesome freedoms we share in America.  I would recommend this book to an adult age group since there are graphic details of death and war throughout the book.  Great read and enjoy!
B007ONSLLQ|4.0|The first 4 tracks alone make it worth purchasing this album.  Overall, the album is very good and tells a nice story (okay maybe not so nice at times).
B0004Z33G4|5.0|I have always been a huge fan of rambo and was happy to have this trilogy in my collection.  Stallone does a great job in portraying john rambo, and this is a must have for all you stallone fans out there!
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Depeche Mode does it again. Pure Bliss! It flows perfectly and reminds me of the Depeche Mode of the early 90s!
B009AMANBA|5.0|WOW! What an amazing performance by Daniel Day Lewis!  My understanding of Abe Lincoln's real character is accurately portrayed in this movie, and Sally Field does a superb job as well!  This is a must watch for history lovers and all who want to learn more about this great American president!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simple, direct, just what I need. Large numbers, bright display. All basic functions are there. And it is free! What more would you want?
B000GFLKEY|5.0|WOW What a performance by denzel as he delivers in this intense story of a very thought out bank robbery!  Denzel goes into the lives of the hostages to try and catch the bank robbers and does a great job!  A must see for all those who like denzel as an actor!
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|This was very informative. Had lots of references and research. Very helpful in what choices to make. Will be recommending to friends & family.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am a pinterest addict. I live this app, it is a must for everything and everyone. But should come with a &#34;caution: may cause addition&#34; sign, great app!
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|I love this movie from studio Ghibili. Its very cute and although a little different from the other recent films (spirited away and howl's moving castle) I like the simple charm of the film. My dvd arrived very fast and was in perfect condition. I like that the seller packaged this well but still kept the box small enough to fit into my mail box. Sometimes I get orders that are small but they're put into this big box and it ends up sitting outside until I get home. The dvd is exactly as it's described, My came with the special features disk and the movie is in perfect condition.
B004SBX112|5.0|great game,yes,I play this game while I watch my daughter 's softball practice.it keeps my mind occupied when there is nothing to do
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Hadn't read Grisham in a while and glad I started again with this one. At some point I though I had it figured out - but I was wrong.
B007N6EUHI|5.0|hi! please, can you tell me if the pc version there is a French translateur of the program thank you very much.
B0037NB6QE|5.0|Since I was unable to carry a pregnancy to the birth of a child, I related to carol. When she held her adopted infant baby boy, I relived the soaring of my heart when I first held my adopted son. I related to all the characters but Carol touched me. The impact of infertility and the endless tests on a marriage was described well. Alix was probably my favorite. And Jacquelyn's love for her grandchild parallels my love for my granddaughter Emma who is more my daughter than granddaughter as her mom has struggled with many problems. Emma is my lifeblood and my daughter in every way possible.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|The Hobbit is one of my favorite films! It's funny, enchanting, magical, action packed, and full of adventure! Love this movie and The Lord of the Rings Trilogy! Amazing!
B0089LOKHG|5.0|Combines elements of first two books into one thrilling finale that is captivating and very interesting. Good closure and interesting reading.
0060922583|5.0|I haven't finished reading it yet but I absolutely love it.  It is the most thought provoking book I've read in years.  This is why it is taking me so long to read.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|great compliment to first book. good for teens interested in romance and action. Exciting scenes and good lead for third book
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is a great game and I completed it in around 4 hours... buying others in the series definitely and I would recommend it 100%
1608871452|5.0|This book is a must have for any Supernatural fan. The pictures are gorgeous, the information is amazing, and it is just perfect. Absolutley love it and am SO glad I bought it.
B007SGM084|5.0|It took a long time for me to read the 3 books. Anger mixed with any sexual activity is rape to me. In the end, I respected a mutual relationship of exploration and enjoyment between the characters and admired the tenacity of both to be better people.
B00BQHA06A|5.0|I Have Been a Him fan since there beginning in 1997 with their Greatest Love Songs Vol 666 album. Why because its different to pretty much any metal or rock band in the world. There sound is unique just has there style and lyrics are. At first i admit that i thought that Ville Valo was gay because of the way he portrayed himself in some of the music videos such has rip of the wings of a butterfly and the video for join me but even if he was or aint i respected the man for his amazing voice and inspirational lyrics. Still to this day i havent found a band quite like them and in their own unique genre they are at the top of there game.<br /><br />To me Tears on Tape surpasses their last few albums such has Screamworks Love In Theory And Practice And Venus Doom. Venus doom was a great album it was different and yet i liked every song in the album. But when they released Screamworks i thought the band had lost their identity. Dont get me wrong its a good album just not what the band is known for and i expected more and ended up thinking that it meant that the band would go into exile which in a a way they did for two years before the release of tears on tape.<br /><br />Any way to get to the point this album is definitive and probably one of their best albums if not there best album yet. It shows that there experiences have made them better and by leaving Sire Records they have returned to their former glory with Razor & Tie records im sure they will keep better has the years go by because to me Him is not just a band its an Experience like no other Through music and lyrics they speak to the darkest and most humane sides of our soul. Saying all this i just hope they release a Bluray Or Dvd showing all of their videos from beginning to the last videos. This album is a definitive album that standout from the rest i own it and i own there other 7 studio albums has well and their live album digital doom and im never gonna say no to a Him album because to me they are one of the best bands out there in our generation.the best bands out there in our generation.
B000002ZR7|5.0|When I was researching some piano pieces on youtube with various pianists to find a good interpretation and role model for my piano student, I came casually along Tatjana Nikolajewa and fell in love with her piano playing style. When she plays J. S. Bach she seems to be looking directly up to Bach where he is sitting in heaven conducting the angels' choirs and getting the input from him how to play his pieces. I find these Goldberg variations magically seducing to listen and fall into a musical trance where nothing but exciting tones exist. I can understand that Mr. Goldberg would have been healed and taken to sleep easily by listening to this Russian Grandma and magic pianist. Thank you to Tatjana Nikolajewa.
B00BU2SIW4|2.0|Is Depeche Mode a blues band or a synth band?  They need to figure it out because although well written, this album is more blues than any type of good synthesizer music.  Bring back Black Celebration etc....  Love these guys but I just cant stand the direction they have gone the last four or so albums.  Please refer to OMD's new album for an example of what keeping it true to your roots is all about.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|The problems of Prometheus begin with Ridley Scott's unparalleled ride as one of the finest filmmakers on the planet. It's extremely rare when he makes a bad film. Not that Prometheus is a bad film...per se...but definitely a disappointment...okay, it was bad. Even A Good Year wasn't...well, all that bad. It had the frivolous charm of a thin Provence rosé. Amusing. Light. As it was meant to be and a divertissement for Ridley who no doubt needed a sillier romp after such darker, more intense and bloody films as Black Hawk Down, Kingdom of Heaven or Body of Lies. So, I, like many were looking for Scott's return to space (the final frontier), the future and figuring out how that metallic-looking, elongated, insect-looking, acid-salivating alien, Alien, got to be such an adorable, durable boffo star of the silver screen.<br /><br />Prometheus begins with a bald, rather sun-starved, eyebrow-ridged, hulky future prospect for the Cincinnati Bengals (they could use a lot of these guys) standing in the shadow of a disc shaped flying saucer hovering over a presumably primordial waterfall where bounced-around molecules in the churning waves below have not been able to cluster into the self-replicating RNA or DNA molecules, the necessary building blocks of life.<br /><br />Never mind that just before we closed in on this seminal moment, that the camera (or virtual CGI camera) passed over a hillside that looked suspiciously green - perhaps from some sort of plant with some sort of very ruggedized RNA strands or non-DNA but remarkably similar DNA-like agent that helped the green planty life replicate itself hither and thither over said hillside. Hmm.<br /><br />No, no...there is no DNA (or even RNA) at this stage in Earth's younger days. Forget the hillside. The brutish muscled-bound alien will open some sort of urn, drink its contents and disintegrate before our eyes so his \\"human-like\\" DNA will mingle and mate with heretofore random socially inept molecules, nucleotides and proteins that have been haplessly bumping into, but unable to get stuck on, one another. This alien future nose tackle will kindly give us our much needed sticky self-replicating molecule as his gift so that all life on Earth could begin -- and stunningly hundreds of millions of years later, the DNA for humans will match identically with the DNA of the aforementioned aliens. WHAT?!!<br /><br />Okay, the mathematical improbabilities and the complete dismissal of genetic evolutionary processes over hundreds of millions of years aside, it was awfully nice of the big fella. On behalf of my fellow humans, thanks ya big pasty-faced lug, ya!<br /><br />The obvious parallel to Arthur Clarke and Stanley Kubrik's 2001: A Space Odyssey is evident even though Clarke/Kubrik's unseen aliens in their story really only gave our early primate ancestors a telepathic evolutionary nudge to become more intelligent and hone their survivalist skills by thumping rivals and other critters over their noggins with large bones that instantly changed into orbiting satellites. And despite that radical jump cut, 2001 still plodded along unmercifully as though prehistory and the modern age had not been left on the editing room floor at all.<br /><br />Scott's Prometheus one-ups 2001 by going back even further than the Dawn of Man (or even the Dawn of Woman...chicken...egg...chicken...egg) to the Dawn of Life (sounds like a dishwashing soap, doesn't it?) to suggest that all life, even green leafy life on hillsides, are courtesy of big-boned, presumably non-primate derived ancestors reverently referred to in the film as \\"The Engineers\\".<br /><br />Prometheus attempts even more profundity, when Dr. (of some scientific discipline) Elizabeth Shaw asks in response to a rare on-board skeptic not fully on-board with this non-evolutionary theory being taken as gospel, \\"Yes but who made them?\\" The `them' of course being The Engineers. My mind was reeling. No, really. Of course, it could have been a reaction to my $100, 25-gallon drum of cherry-vanilla spiked Coke Zero and the large case of Milk Duds that reclined in the seats on either side of me in the empty theater. I think they may have enjoyed the film more than I did. They're gone now.<br /><br />Where was I? Oh, yes...in the film, newly discovered cave paintings along with Egyptian and Mayan hieroglyphics and an animation cell from The Flintstones  serve as the catalyst to this epic Riddlyian quest. Two scientists, and I use that term loosely, via a little metallic Rubik's cube project holograms to a witless Prometheus crew (that would be the crew of the starship Prometheus not necessarily the crew of the film) to explain why they've signed up for this fiasco.<br /><br />The holograms superimpose themselves on one another to startlingly reveal that all the ancient images are telling the cast and theatergoers the same thing -- that we could have gotten this same poppycock by watching Ancient Aliens on the History Channel and that we were all made by slender NBA super-sized aliens not the beefier NFL-looking brute seen earlier. One must assume that later in prehistory Engineers who have held their corporeal selves together palled around with our primitive ancestors but must have been dieting because of some proto-Bloombergian tyrant's edict about transfats, salts and sugars.<br /><br />Apparently this amazing discovery, not repeated episodes of Ancient Aliens or Stargate, was enough to convince a dying, wrinkly trillionaire Peter Weyland (who is not necessarily Richard Branson) to spend a trillion dollars or so (chump change in Obama's America, so a pittance really in the year 2089) for a two-year voyage (and that's pretty quick really) across the expanse of intergalactic space to meet The Engineers and to ask them about the secret of eternal life. (Was there even a science advisor on this film? If so, did he change his name on the credits?)<br /><br />Here's a nit, though. Why spend so much time making otherwise scrawny, sunken-cheeked Aussie actor Guy Pearce into a heavier, wrinkled nonagenarian Peter Weyland if we haven't seen his more youthful countenance earlier in the film? Why not just cast a heavier, wrinkled nonagenarian? Helen Thomas was available, wasn't she? I hear she's got quite the range. Casting Thomas might have better explained Charlize Theron's Meredith Vickers' frosty, sullen...let's face it, bitchy behavior a lot better than the revelation that for some elusive reason, she is the estranged daughter of that more likeable older guy...uh, Guy.<br /><br />Another nit...while I'm at it. I personally have a problem with certain movie references in other movies. It seems to me that some movies should almost exist in a universe of their own making. Scott's Blade Runner is such a movie. In Prometheus, Michael Fassbinder's David- superbly acted by the way, is referred to as a replicant, a term, popularized in Blade Runner. Essentially, Scott's not so subtle nod to his earlier work and himself, almost as if to say, \\"Remember me? I'm the bloke that made Blade Runner. I loved that word replicant so much, I decided to use it again in Prometheus. You noticed it, didn't you?\\"<br /><br />By the way, for all the pre-movie hype about Prometheus not necessarily being a prequel to Scott's amazingly directed and edited moody taught thriller, Alien; it is after all the swirling and silicon debris dust clouds settle...the, uh...prequel to Alien. Not that that's a bad thing, because as a prequel, Prometheus is a tad more coherent than anything more cosmologically complex it attempts to explain.<br /><br />Visual, action and character references to Alien also abound. The character of David not only is a prequel prototype of Ash, Ian Holm's unfeeling, smug and snarky robot (not replicant) who was just one consonant away being a real as_ but both are decapitated and continue to speak after decapitation...because they have really good agents.<br /><br />After Prometheus lands on the planet where The Engineers have beckoned them across space and time and space-time, in no time at all the crew is happily gallivanting like giddy schoolchildren into what appears as an abandoned dome-shaped building with curved arms much like Bernini's curved colonnade around Vatican square but that we all know is the alien spacecraft we saw a few decades ago in Alien. Please gasp here.<br /><br />I'll spare you the ponderous details over much of the preposterous narrative suffice to say that David, the soulless, seemingly amoral replicant finds some organic goo and a little black ladybug-like nub that he later not so amorally and deviously drops into Logan Marshall-Green's martini so the hyphenated actor would become infected and be used as a host for some sort of nasty, alien life form because that's what actors do to other actors so they can have larger roles. Happens all the time.<br /><br />Marshall-Green's Charlie Holloway who is a doctor of some scientific discipline and love interest of the aforementioned Dr. (of some scientific discipline) Elizabeth Shaw, proceeds to make love to Dr. Shaw instantly impregnating her with the alien life form which gestates faster than you can say, \\"That was some spicy meatball.\\" Once she is informed that she's with tentacle-tucked alien life form and amazingly the equivalent of three months along, Dr. Shaw assertively makes her way to an automated, self-contained Mr. Operation machine where she punches a few buttons and has the offending alien fetus extracted and later killed while she has her abdomen stapled up. She is a doctor, after all.<br /><br />See how convenient the future is? DIY births and abortions. Take your pick, even if you use a Mr. Operation for Men. I had the nagging feeling that there was some sort of underlying message about unwanted pregnancies and a woman's right to choose...not that tentacled alien life forms are what nature or the Creator may have intended no matter how adorable and clingy they might turn out to be.<br /><br />Convinced that the newborn squid-thingy is dead Dr. Shaw seals up the operating room to find out if anyone on board the Prometheus is up for a little backgammon but is not terribly surprised to find that the old geezer, Weyland has come along for this two-year star trek. But you know and I know and Sigourney Weaver (who's not in this film at all) knows that the icky-many-rubbery-legged-thingy left in the O.R. ain't dead because we've seen Alien and Fatal Attraction and the career of Pauly Shore--and we all know that Mr. Squid is going to get bigger and nastier and more tentaclier and jump out in a very predictable and anti-climactic sort of way.<br /><br />Meanwhile back inside the Alien craft structure, two doltish, goofball, comic relief scientists who can't seem to find their way out of the film fast enough, Fifield and Milburn find themselves in a worm-infested, muddy, soppy alien nursery suddenly being observed by a nasty, slithery, hissing cobra-like creature. Milburn, the biologist in the party, attempts to play with and fawningly coo to the alien cobra because he apparently mistakes the obviously threatening and hissing reptile for a golden retriever puppy. He and his Scottish geologist sidekick (who is perpetually angry - those Scots - at having signed up for such an awful assignment...one supposes the mission...not necessarily the film...but then again...) are gruesomely rewarded for Millburn's stupidity which, for the theater audience, comes as no surprise and actually a good deal of relief, since they were both more annoying than humorous and deserved to die a lot sooner. Three cheers for alien cobra creature!<br /><br />Much mayhem soon ensues and I'll skip a whole lot of the not-terribly suspenseful action and the tedious ending, suffice to say that Dr. Shaw's refrain of \\"We were SO wrong!\\" begged SO many comments and questions, like, \\"We were SO wrong about the science in this script!\\" Like how is it exactly that humans can evolve miraculously from alien DNA hundreds of millions of years ago, with all the random environmental factors that affected life on earth over time including pandemic viruses, being eaten as prey, oh and the occasional Earth-colliding asteroid that destroyed most of the life on the planet - AND STILL BE AN IDENTICAL DNA MATCH WITH OTHERWORLDLY ALIENS?!!! Let's take a closer look at that alien DNA and see if it includes the chromosomal fusion evident in humans that indicates that humans and chimpanzees and bonobos have a common genetically-linked primate ancestor. (If you feel like challenging me on that last point, please take it up with biologist Ken Miller, he's the expert on this.)<br /><br />I know, I know. It's a movie. It's only a movie. How could I have been SO wrong to expect something better from Ridley Scott? Perhaps little things have big beginnings to paraphrase the replicant and Lawrence of Arabia - now that was a film!<br /><br />But the special effects were cool.
1451624468|2.0|I gave this book 2 stars because there are some good explanations of cosmological theory throughout the book. HOWEVER, this guy is not just an Atheist, he is a God hater. And he keeps trying to make a point that people who do believe in God are just plain stupid.  I am not religious at all, and I respect peoples belief in theism, atheism or otherwise. But when someone keeps trying to say your an idiot because you don't believe what I do...well, you're just a hater. And it gets boring after a while in this book. Besides that, the author states that he doesn't want to live in a universe that has a god, but he wants to find all the answers of the universe...in short, he wants to be God, himself. Able to create (or sell) a universe whenever he chooses...YIKES!!  I wouldn't want to live there.  Besides this, he writes with an arrogance that science is always right because they have devised mathematics to prove things. Well, it is often the case that scientists alter or change their math because it doesn't do what they want it to. For instance, Einstein's cosmological constant. Also, he goes on and on about how he discovered things long before the people who were credited with a discovery. Or how people told him they would prove him wrong and he got the last laugh. Dude, you want a universe so that you can pull the wings and legs off it and make everyone bow to your superiority (or more like inferiority complex). Someday we may find that the universe is not quite flat, or that we can transfer information faster than the speed of light. There are as many explanations for the universe as there are digits in the number pi.  Don't be a hater.<br /><br />If you want the same kind of cosmological wrap-up, read Brian Greene, Sean Carroll, Paul Halpern, Ian Sample, Brian Cox... The list goes on. Same science without the negativity.
B00B4804KS|2.0|A few days ago I received my copy of the 3D version of Jurassic Park. The 3D effects on my 60 inch Samsung SmarTV were quite impressive. Then I popped in the Blu-ray disc and began to notice a good deal of grainy artifacts in the beginning of the film. I thought once the setting changed from the desert excavation of the velociraptor to the location footage in Kaua'i that the grain would be gone...uh no. Some of the interior shots in the Jurassic Park computer center, especially at the edges of the frame were filled with a great deal of dancing grain. These aren't the artifacts noticeable during motion shots that some LCD sets have trouble with, this was obviously just a very bad transfer to Blu-ray. And since I have an extensive collection of Blu-ray DVDs that don't have this issue, I think it's reasonable to assume that the issue isn't with my Samsung. Is anyone else seeing this issue?
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was one of the best games I have ever played.  Can't wait for another one<br />I have played many games on my fire but this is by far the best.

B00280LYIC|5.0|Our third grade class loved the book because it always left us hanging at the end of the chapter, so we wanted to keep reading.  It was interesting to learn about the Greek gods while reading an adventure story.  BEST BOOK EVER!

B000JMKQX0|5.0|It's entertaining and forces you to consider the often overlooked areas of apocalypse....such as zombies in the water etc.  If your a fan of zombies it's a great book...if not..it's still a great read.

B003TGMFG4|2.0|I bought this book after reading the sample kindle version. I thought the book was going to tell the story of what happened to Chris in Alaska. Unfortunately about 80% of the book is filler. I seemed to get lost in boredom, even skipping hunks of the book at times. Krakauer told whole chapter stories of his own adventures, and even more about other explorers that died. I only wanted to read about Chris! The book wonders off so much that at times I was even confused about where it was going or who I was reading about. Definitely not well written. Maybe it would have been best to keep as an article.

B0091THRCU|1.0|I put my iphone 5 in this case and could not get it out.  It took quite a few minutes of tugging, pulling, and swearing to finally free my phone from the case.  I will not even try to put the phone back in the case after how hard it was to pull it out.  The magnetic pull cord didn't even work either.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I have been playing for a couple of months and love the way you can breed all of the different Dragons and get new baby dragons.Sometimes it is a wonderful surprise when you have a rare Dragon from two you have already been breeding and get a new one instead of what you were expecting.

1475972350|3.0|If you've ever muttered about something being a waste of time, then this killer can relate. On a vendetta to punish people who've wasted his time, he leaves a gruesome collection in his wake.<br /> With very few clues to go on, Max Larson, head detective on the case, is dumbfounded. Bloody words at the crime scenes left Detective Larson know the motive. They simply wasted his time. Such a vague motive leaves no room for guesswork. Max needs to be on his game, but now he's been given a rookie as a partner. Anyone could be next. No rhyme or reason is apparent.<br /> Gory crime scene photos, mutilated witnesses, & a decade long bloodbath are all Max has to go on. Can the seasoned detective & his rookie partner figure out the mess before they are out of time?<br /> Todd M. Thiede has certainly created a unique plot here. The killer's reasoning & methods were clever. I did have some issue with the character dialogue. It seemed forced. More natural conversation would've made the characters much more relatable. Most folks don't speak in full sentences or not use any contractions.<br /> Also, there was a lack of climax. Starting out, there's an air of excitement of who this killer is & why he's killing. Then it is just handed to us in a neat tidy package. Perhaps I've seen or read too many thrillers. For me, it simply landed flat. Entirely readable, it's a 3-1/2 star novel for me.<br /> I received 1 eBook copy in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.
0470474874|3.0|Just hit your F1 key if you're a 'figure-it-out' kinda guy like me. I bought this thinking I'd have a very critical tool in my belt at work. The explanations are easy to go through if you like to scan an index, then search by page number. It refers to the CD-ROM a lot, as if I actually use my CD drive and refer to these as &#34;CD-ROMs&#34;.<br /><br />It (the book) is an antiquated model of basic information. Hit F1 in Excel 2010, and you have a basic reference (like this book) plus handfuls of articles showing more efficient or alternative methods. Windows still has ONE thing going for it, Excel. And they're doing it well. I'm keeping the book in case I lose internet in my office or run out of screen space for a help screen.<br /><br />-1 star for old publishing method, -1 for CD-ROM references. 3 stars for very relevant and basic information on such a practical program.
B0078ZTWP4|4.0|Works great very good light output even on low power. Only have used it in attic for work use but is perfect. Easy to setup and blinking green light makes it easy to find.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I read the other reviews before I purchased this set and they were critical of all four books being together but it did not bother me.  I read seamlessly from one to the next.  I have about 75 pages left of book 4 and have already purchased Book 5.  Great series!!!!!!!!!  You will not put it down once you start reading it!
B0011WKDS0|3.0|Book was pretty funny, strange, but funny.  Junior high son enjoyed it.  But beware that it contains some foul language.
B00AEFXN46|5.0|The Blu-ray was very good. Although I've seen this particular film a few times before and am familiar with the story, the Blu-ray lent it an aura that made it as enjoyable as the first time. Huston is my favorite director, bar none.
B0045HCJQW|3.0|Although I love Jimmy Stewart and Cary Grant both, this is not my favorite movie.  It is ok, but nothing special.

0345529057|5.0|I loved these books! My only wish would be that book 5 was included in the set. This is a great series - it was nice having all the books as a set.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|After just listening to the book from Audible, after having read it twice years ago, I had to respond to a bunch of nonsensical comments by other reviews.<br /><br />Light Spoilers<br /><br />Many reviews say \\"nothing happens\\" Which baffles my mind. The perpetually broke Kvothe (which was getting tiring actually) now has full funding to the university and a generous income from two different perpetual sources as well. He learned to fight from the deadliest warriors in the land. He can now call the wind, almost at will. He becomes a man in the arms of a goddess. Essentially, this boy with musical talent and a brilliant mind is now well on his way to becoming a fighter/magic-user/thief in the best tradition of D&D. So much happens in this book! Do we learn more about the Amir and ther Chandrian, no. Does that mean nothing happens? Hardly.<br /><br />As for the sex that some people bafflingly complain about, it's beyond tame. There are no descriptions of naughty bits or them being licked or stroked, just innuendo and kissing. And the amount he has? A lot with Felurian. A bar maid after he leaves the land of the fae. Random girls in the university town he lives in. It is implied by his friends that he sleeps with a lot of women but that all happens off camera.<br /><br />Denna, totally annoying and unbelievable. I agree on that part.<br /><br />I thought the book was brilliant but it had some flaws. Too many chapters where there is too much setting and background or worshipping of Denna. The Maer acting anything less than completely enamored of Kvothe makes no sense. He turns him from a crippled, dottering old man who can't keep food down to a healthy man married to the love of his life with a child on the way. And gets back a king's ransom in taxes from bandits that Kvothe returns to him. Kvothe even wooed his lady love FOR HIM. It makes no sense that he would treat Kvothe so badly until his generous reward at the end.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|If ten words could say it then Mr. Martin will add twenty more for good measure but his character development is outstanding.

B00846REIS|5.0|loved it! This is not a rip off of 50 Shades at all! I don't know how any reader could say this. I can't wait for book #3!
B00B1CGDTS|4.0|Not the travesty some have made it out to be, but somewhat disappointing. Olive Films have been doing a great job with their handling of Paramount-owned titles to blu-ray, especially old Republic films. When I saw this title announced and that it was from Olive Films, I naturally made the assumption that they had licensed the official Batjac version from Paramount. Wrong. This version has been restored from public domain sources by a German company. It's not horrible by any means, just not the version I expected. I don't think Olive meant to mislead anyone. They're otherwise doing some good work.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a really fun game. It's similar to temple run except your in a subway. I would recommend this. It keeps you entertained.
B00AUU2KI0|5.0|I have only read a few chapters and I really like it my daughter did not care for the beginning very much she told me it was slow but I think it builds up the story line and this will explain to you why things happen the way they do.<br /><br />Good book so far

B003O86FMW|5.0|Suzanne Collins is a great author who takes her time creating the hunger games the book that takes you to another world.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is seriously one of the best games ever. What you do is this;<br />You buy dragons and ease them and feed them but then there are runes of dragons for jewels. It looks bad at first but the makers are super smart. They made it so when you get a breeding cave you can easily get dragons that cost gems. Eventually you can even get a rainbow dragon from breeding. It is also fun to chose names for your dragon. At first they come with names but if you tap on their name tag you can change their names. I would highly recommend this game for everyone even if you don't like dragons.

B00004RFFS|5.0|I have been waiting a long time to get my hands on a copy of Interview with the Vampire: The Chronicles. I have to say that I am very happy with it, even though the movie is a little old, the producers made a good choice in making  such a fine movie.
B002VHI8J0|3.0|Cloud Atlas should come with a warning.<br /><br />Editors and those who like clean writing beware: This book contains a multitude of different styles of English. It may make your eyes bleed, your head ache and you wish to punch your inner editor in the head repeatedly until they lay dead.<br /><br />I struggled immensely with this book. I shouldn't have. It was a brilliant story.<br /><br />In it, the characters came to life and ran rampant around in my head, giving my dying inner editor plenty of room, in case they caught her illness. They couldn't of course. They were immunised against the horrendous-to-read disintegrated English that was used in mini story #6, or the Olde English used in mini story #1.<br /><br />If I take my inability to stomach some of the writing choices used by David Mitchell, this book would probably be about a 4.5 out of 5. But that would not be a true to me review. It would be accurate in terms of the writing, but not of the readers' experience.<br /><br />For some people, this book will not be an issue; if you can read and switch off your inner editor then you're set for an amusing ride through the time-bending world built in Cloud Atlas. If you can't, you, like me will probably struggle with it.<br /><br />It frustrated me more, that David felt the need to incorporate this type of writing. I think the characterisation could have been portrayed in different ways without pissing off some of the reading community. Perhaps it was a challenge to see if he could do it, I don't know. But it was a decision that changed a very good book to only an 'ok' one.<br /><br />The connection between the mini stories is wide and varied. I liked how each was linked, some more than others, but I thought it was rather ingenious. It showed how good a writer David Mitchell is, his ability to cover a wide variety of times and characters, no matter how different they may be.<br /><br />I personally highlighted a number of lines/quotes from this book, the writing was excellent. If you're studying writing and/or trying to work with characterisation, description, or generally dissecting writing, this is a great book for that. I have learnt a lot from David.<br /><br />If you like the look of the new movie, I think you'll get a lot from reading the book first. I haven't seen the movie yet (it's on my list to do now that I've finished the book) but I am unsure how well they could capture the richness that David creates and captures in his writing. Good luck Hollywood you're going to need it!!was excellent.

B003JTHXOK|4.0|Another great story by Nicholas sparks, book is always well written easy to follow , smooth transition. Brings emotions that makes you want to keep reading! This time was more suspenseful compared to his other books. I didn't know I was on the last chapter until it just ended suddenly and I was not ready for it. Can't wait to watch the movie!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|...sell your running shoes and go for a 8 hours run!<br />Loved it!<br />It is a very entertaining collection of weird but lovely characters you feel to know since years after finishing the book.
0451530926|4.0|I sometimes enjoy these types of stories.  I like the cleanness of the language (no taking the name of the Lord in vain) and the story is interesting because it follows the may character's life from early adulthood to death and so it also illustrates the learning and healing process he went through in his life.  Some of my friends don't like the book because it isn't a fairytale, but I think it teaches good life lessons and enjoyed its epic nature.

I started with the first show and was immediately hooked!  On top of that, I listened on the Kindle with super earphones that are stereo, and it was absolutely like being in a movie theater.  The photography, the scenery, the details and characters...  I bought Season 3, and can't wait for Season 4 next fall.  This is one not to miss!
B00028HBKM|5.0|I have not watched it yet, but have seen the movie in the theater and at home.  I know that it is an excellent movie and am sure the  copy I bought is fine.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Short:<br /><br />It's very similar to X-Files (yay!) with of course more modern scientific basis. The acting is top shelf, the story even more so. If you like science fiction, this is definitely worth watching.
B0073TZ1AA|4.0|this app could use some instructions and a whole lot of polishing, but as it is i find it to be pretty useful. i can stand the voice because i've been experimenting with TTS since its inception, so i'm used to it. it's just a bit tinny so i had to turn the volume down a tad.<br /><br />i think i have tried out all the features and gotten them to work. i read a couple different documents. i really like how it shows the sentence being read. this can be helpful for someone with ADD or any kind of reading problem. unfortunately it will not read documents in .docx format, which is very common now so they should fix this.<br /><br />the one thing i couldn't get to work was reading text embedded in a jpeg image. the app told me to change something in the settings (i can't remember what) to get that to work, but i couldn't find it in the settings. for that reason i discounted one star.<br /><br />i would have discounted another star for rough interface and lack of instructions, but i really think it's a four star app, at least as far as my own needs are concerned. well, it's four stars considering that i got it for free today as the FAOTD. on any other day, i'd say the price is a bit steep for something so rough. but if you have $6 to spend on better voices, and have some time to fiddle with the configurations, this could be a great app.<br /><br />i hope the developers continue to improve this app and update it based on all the reviews. that would be a very good thing.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Couldn't wait to watch next series. Now into series three. Do love all the English series. Follow as many as are available. This one will be one of my favorites next to Dutchess of Duke St. Brendan Coyle also on Downton  Abbey another series I follow.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Heard about this book on the radio. With such a good price, decided to give it a try.  Really enjoy the story and the writing. Look forward to more books from the author.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|What can I say... This DVD captures the Bee Gees live as they will never be again. A MUST SEE!!! I've seen it 5 time already and will definitely see it more. The audio quality through my DTS 5.1 system sounds great.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|After finishing the series I can't say I loved it. The first was probably the best in my opinion and I think that is because the possibilities were much more varied. After that it wasn't too hard to predict what was going to happen next. One thing that made no sense to me was the \\"visor\\" in the helmet. First off why would a verdant, alive landscape motivate people to do the cleaning? Secondly, it stops working after she walks over the hill? I don't get it. There were several things like this that don't allow me to give it more than three stars.

B00915G6WQ|5.0|all these seasons in and instead of my interest waning, i am instead front and center every time in the late summer enthralled by dexter.  season seven was no exception.  when the last scene unrolled and this season was concluded, i was engulfed by questions i'd never had about dexter before this.  i seem to be the only one here who had this response to this season.  but here goes:<br /><br />why have i been assuming that Harry, dexter's father, is exactly what he seems to be, a great cop looking out for his serial killer son (who indeed is probably his own as dexter's late mother was his informant)? why have i been assuming that Harry, his wife and daughter are pure as the driven snow and dexter is the only psychopath in the family? why?  because Harry tells me so every time his ghost is on screen. there is so much else going on this season that i don't know why this question started plaguing me now but it did.<br /><br />as for the season itself, one deft touch is to have miami's worst police detective, the Latina spitfire LaGuarda  hot on Dexter's trail as a serial killer. she's right but she stumbles all over trying to catch him.  i just loved this aspect.<br /><br />then we have a gay russian mobster hot on dexter's trail for killing his lover. as he becomes more and more unhinged over his lover's death, dexter becomes the least of his problems--remember these three words which do not exist in the russian vocabulary together as far as the other russian mobsters are concerned--\\"gay russian mobster\\".<br /><br />we also have a female serial killer with whom dexter falls in love.  deb goes berserko over this development.<br /><br />great season which you must watch!!!!!<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B001G70M6S|5.0|Great film for your old Land Series Polaroid camera! If you like the classic old style polaroid picture this is the right type of film.
B0041VT6HW|4.0|I really liked the comics when they were on the stands.  The movie stays true to the original story.  You have have a little trouble with the plot if you don'd know the story.
B005LAIIKI|3.0|When I think of the great Western films that I love -- The Outlaw Josey Wales, She Wore A Yellow Ribbon, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, The Wild Bunch, et al. -- and of all the great Quentin Tarantino movies that I'm passionate about -- pretty much all of them except Death Proof, and I still like that one -- it leaves me utterly slack-jawed that I'm not overly crazy about Django Unchained, Tarantino's latest and long-awaited offering starring Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Kerry Washington. All fanboy expectations put aside, I'm puzzled at how such an epic Western -- or \\"Southern\\" as Tarantino himself describes the movie -- can have so many moments of awe-inspiring, wide-eyed cinematic greatness and yet somehow come up a little short in the end.<br /><br />That's not to say Django Unchained isn't a good movie. Quite the opposite, especially given the range of terrific performances, absolutely exquisite cinematography, crackling moments of suspense and heart pumping action sequences balanced with side-splitting humor and quiet dramatic tension. The widescreen cinematic goods are delivered in abundance, with Tarantino's nigh inimitable panache. The plot and characters suffer in comparison; the larger-than-life widescreen bombasticity underscores an underlying story that feels at times, strangely unfocused and adrift.<br /><br />The Civil War-era tale begins with the freeing of Django (Jamie Foxx) from bondage by German immigrant, dentist, and bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz) Dr. King Schultz. Schultz is after a gang known as The Brittle Brothers, one with a huge bounty on their heads, but doesn't have a clue as to what they look like. Django does, as the brothers were overseers on his former plantation. Schultz and Django team up, realize they make a perfect pair, and become partners under the condition that Schultz help Django find and free his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from her enslavement. The couple was forcibly separated after a failed escape attempt, and the parallels between their condition and the Teutonic legend of Siegmund and Brunhilde motivates Schultz enough to help Django in his quest.<br /><br />The story is simple enough, but an effective one. The first act of the movie is easily the strongest one; the \\"origin story\\" of Django and Schultz, delving deep into classic Western cinema tropes which Tarantino uses to thrilling results. By the time the obligatory montage sequence occurs, during which we see the pair mowing down bad guys and crossing the exquisitely-shot wilderness on horseback, all set to the exhilarating tones of Jim Croce (!), these guys already feel like western southern legends. Add to this Tarantino's penchant for utilizing wonderful or rarely-seen TV/movie character actors, his masterful hand at delivering humor and suspense, and his offbeat but extremely satisfying soundtrack choices, and so far this movie feels like another gripping Tarantino epic. Yes, that was Tom Wopat (Luke from `The Dukes of Hazzard') as Marshall Gill Tatum during the Daughtrey standoff scene, and man was he great. Who'da thunk it?<br /><br />And then sadly... the movie comes off the rails by the time it remembers to address the \\"Finding Django's wife\\" plot. It shifts into a meatier dramatic mode, which is welcome, but by this time we've come to realize that Django, as a lead character, is less compelling than Schultz. By his nature he has to play Schultz's valet/slave/sidekick in order to ward off any undue suspicion, so Foxx's performance is undeniably and understandably restrained, but there's no sense of underlying fire, grit, or danger behind his eyes. We're not entirely sure what drives him at any given moment, and his transition to a driving, calculating, proactive character by the movie's last act comes off as unconvincing and capricious. Furthermore, the act that motivates Django's transformation (I'm tip-toeing around spoilers here) is so out-of-character, selfish, and quizzically idiotic that it not only makes absolutely no sense in the first place, it almost negates everything compelling that the first act of the movie established.<br /><br />That's not to say there isn't enough action, humor, violence, dialog, and satisfaction to redeem Django Unchained. Furthermore, the powerhouse performances by Leonardo DiCaprio as Calvin Candie (the plantation über-lord who has possession of Broomhilda) and especially Samuel Jackson as Stephen (a terrifyingly compelling \\"House Negro\\" whose Kaiser Soze-esque switch from a Stepin Fetchit caricature to icily cunning confidante/strategist is both hilariously entertaining and brilliantly rendered) keep the second half of the movie afloat as it starts to needlessly drift away from its far more interesting first half. A slam-bang action finale ends the film with style and kinetic satisfaction, but it's akin to starting your dinner with a perfectly aged and deliciously marbled ribeye grilled to perfection, and having that taken away after joyously eating half of it and replaced with a decent burger. It's good and tasty and satisfying, but damn, you really wanted that steak.
B0034G4OZE|5.0|What were your teen years like? Sleepovers, baseball and paper routes? For a startling many, the teen years are the exact opposite of that. But, when all that stress becomes too much to handle, what do you do?<br /><br />  Craig Gilner (played by Keir Gilchrist) is a sixteen year-old who's contemplated suicide many times. One night, he dreams of riding his bike to the Brooklyn Bridge. In the dream, before he can jump, his mother (played by Lauren Graham), father (played by Jim Gaffigan) and little sister appear on the bridge. After a brief conversation, Craig loses his balance and falls to the water below. He wakes up after that and heads to the nearest emergency room. The admitting nurse, who was on the phone at the time of Craig's arrival, hears him state that he intends to kill himself and simply hands him a clipboard with attached admitting forms. While sitting in the waiting area, a man in scrubs in a lab coat (played by Zach Galifianakis) strikes up a conversation and then leaves abruptly. When he is actually examined, his doctor (played by Aasif Mandvi) does not believe that Craig is a threat to himself but Craig is adamant and, as such, is admitted for evaluation. The part of the hospital usually reserved for mentally ill teens is undergoing renovations so Craig is placed with the adults. His roommate, a middle-aged Egyptian named Muqtada (played by Bernard White) rarely leaves his bed and has not left his room in weeks. The initial shock provokes feelings of \\"buyer's remorse\\" in Craig but the hospital staff is not permitted to release him without evaluating him, which will take several days. In that time he becomes acquainted with other patients such as fellow teen, Noelle (played by Emma Roberts) and the man he encountered in the waiting room, Bobby (Galifianakis) who regularly leaves the ward, without permission, dressed in scrubs to avoid being escorted back.<br /><br />  I love this movie. Gilchrist masterfully portrays, in my opinion, a young adult grappling with issues that are far beyond his comprehension who is trying desperately to conceal that at the same time. Graham as the caring, over-emotional mother is someone we feel great sympathy for. Zach Galifianakis, for the first time in his acting career, scales back on the eccentricities we usually see in him and, surprisingly enough, shows talent as an actor. It seems odd that the least eccentric character that he's ever portrayed would be a mental patient, but that doesn't make it any less true. To sum up, It's Kind of a Funny Story is a near-brilliant film and I would advise anyone who found my review intriguing in the slightest to see it at their earliest possible convenience.ppling with issues that are far beyond his comprehension who is trying desperately to conceal that at the same time.

0156027321|3.0|Loved the movie but couldn't get into this book.  Guess the movie spoiled it for me.  Read the book then see the movie!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I am a novice photographer and have very little equipment right now.  I may get a couple of more lenses which this plenty of room for storing more lenses  This is going to work for my needs.
B00018D3RI|5.0|It is one of my favorite series. They make great partners. I have enjoyed watching the series over the years.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|I usually listen to country but have an interest in Bruno Mars since a girl from my school danced with him on the Ellen show. Bruno Mars is a true Renaissance man, This CD has a great mix of upbeat tunes and slower jams. \\"Locked Out of Heaven\\" channels the Police and \\"Show Me\\" has a great island vibe, but each with Bruno Mars' unique touch. \\"Gorilla\\" is a very unique \\"love\\" song. The simplicity of \\"When I was Your Man\\" is what makes it so powerful and the other end of the spectrum is \\"Money Make Her Smile\\", a new-world, synthesizer fest. My favorites are the throwback-feeling \\"If I Knew\\" and \\"Treasure\\", a 70s funk jam, straight out of the roller rink.
0451232852|5.0|Ken Follett is my favorite author and he has yet again outdone himself. This is an awesome book that intermingles fiction and history  and is the epitome of a good read.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Jodi Picoult at her finest again!! Once i start one of her books i van never put them down and i never want it to end! This is a story about true love found at such an early age and how one will do anything for the other.  A must read!
0425252868|1.0|The book is like a report, the author just wrote the story which was told to him by veterans- it would have been great if it was a fictional book based on these stories. He simply wrote whatever he was told without filtering anything. He goes on writing short chapters giving unnecessary information like he spends a chapter on &#34;the bear&#34;.<br /><br />As a kid I heard the story of a soldier who defied his officers order to shoot a wounded enemy, and doing so was shot with the wounded enemy - this is chivalry not the encounter which the two pilots have in the book.<br /><br />And I hated when the book proclaims that the German air force had nothing to do with the holocaust, they were so innocent - they just watched the nazis kill the jews. The story portrays a German officer as a brave men for refusing to give SS his men, cause he  knew what SS wanted to do.<br /><br />Its just a sham to clear the names of German surviving officers of the crimes the committed. If they knew what nazis were doing to the jews and remained silent then they are equally accountable. In todays world no surviving nazis would openly declare that they were the ones who killed jews- they will just point fingers to someone else, like the main characters.<br /><br />I would recommend Ken Follet's century trilogy books if you are interested in knowing about the world wars.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|My daughter and I get the biggest kick out of this game. We never get tired of playing.  She always takes care of winning prizes for our upgrades.  We also like to make our army all women soldiers.  Thanks for the fun.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|I have seen this movie about 8 times.  I don't seem to get tired of it.  Carl Sagan you are missed.  Wish he was still with us.
0307476464|2.0|1Q84 is a hyper-inflated sci-fi mystery/thriller that pretends to be a magnum opus on account of its 900 pages and 3-volume format. In spite of this, it is a relatively fast read, written in the standard detective novel syntax and diction. It carries the reader through many extraneous episodes of questionable import and annoying, multiple reiterations of selected episodes in the protagonists' lives. With a treatment less pretentious and more masterful, I imagine a terser and more compelling work, rather than the indulgent gesture of writer and editor attempting to create a masterpiece of postmodern fiction.<br /><br />Not happy to master and play upon the particular virtues of the detective story genre, it attempts more grandiose effects with little success. The work is fraught with references to the literary pedigree it aspires to: Proust, The Brothers Karamazov, The Golden Bough, and of course George Orwell. None of this succeeds in anything other than tedium and annoyance.<br /><br />Oftentimes the writing is silly and even tedious. Banter between the female lead and her woman friend can be unbelievably awful for being artificial, infantile and just plain idiotic. The trivialized treatment of women throughout is trite when not insulting. The sex episodes are standard Playboy drivel.  Attempts at moralizing ludicrous.<br /><br />Of course, since I was reading a translation, I kept hoping that the larger narrative structures would come to the novel's rescue. Sadly, they didn't. The English version was translated by two translators to abbreviate the delay to publish for the English-reading world. I think I preferred the second translator (Part 3) to the first, but there was not such a difference between them to deflect the blame away from the Japanese author himself.<br /><br />The friend who suggested I read Murakami also suggested I start with one of his shorter works, Norwegian Wood, Kafka on the Shore, or The Wind-up Bird Chronicle. I can't speak for these, butI can warn the unsuspecting reader to steer clear of this hyper-inflated, humorless and silly magnum dopus.
0525952926|5.0|Mr. Follett knows how to write to keep the pages turning, also the first book The Fall of Giants is very good.  Both books are fiction, but they read as if they were non-fiction, very believable.
1400052181|3.0|I chose this rating for the second 1/2, as the first 1/2 increased my perception of living and the benefit of science.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I seriously read this book in two days couldn't put it down. Love it. I got so emotionally wrapped  up in it.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I like this game it gets really fun once you get the hang of it only bad thing is after you find everything if u want to keep going you have to buy the next one but they are probably worth it
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved this game! Sad now that it's over. Quirky and fun all the way through. Every new find was a triumph!!! Ready for the next one!!!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|One of the best, if not the best space book I have ever read -- I just love it so!<br /><br />This book is so well & believably written -- whether entirely accurate, I cannot say but I am happily fooled. The plot has realistic ups & downs, the story never lags, and the author's use of differing types of POVs was just brilliant.<br /><br />You'll have to like having things quantified in order to not be annoyed by this book -- fortunately I *heart* quantifications!  Its like this book was written with everything I loved in mind: humour, technical details cleverly explained in layman's terms, astronauts, lack of overly dramatic &#34;insightfulness&#34;...<br /><br />Speaking of, one reviewer complained about the main character being too cavalier in such a desperate situation.  One, if you know what you your doing and keep up the hope & optimism, the situation is not so desperate (though still dire.)  Two, I would hope our astronauts are all vetted and don't tend towards psychosis or depression. Three, he's an astronaut -- I pretty sure keeping level headed in a confined space surrounded by myriad paths to death for months on end is a basic requirement.<br /><br />Anyway, I utterly recommend this read if you are at all interested in space, astronauts and the space program.  It's great for those of us with middling intelligence and for those who could be astronauts themselves, try and see if you can solve the problems before the main character does -- Fun for all!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This is not my favorite Grisham book but I did enjoy it.  I expected there to be more content related to the courtroom.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|Evangelion is the first out of four movies for the remake of the Evangelion T.V. series. The animation is great but there was a moment in the anime that seemed a bit lazy, but wasn't enough to take off a star. The colors are bright and wonderful, and the sound effects and music are great.
B0091REZMW|4.0|really fun game would be nice if energy lasted a little longer there are probably tricks that I haven't been able to figure out yet
B006LSZECO|3.0|Slow start, then picked up with interesting twists and turns - however the ending left me questioning why I took the time to read the entire book.  Glad it was a quick read.
B00BZODDYU|5.0|Just a top notch, beautiful horror film!!  Everything about it rules, and no worries about how it wasn't directed by Guillermo del Toro...anybody who is a fan of his films will definitely appreciate it.  Excellent characters and story line, and I will be watching this one again and again.  Check it out, way better than most of the other horror films around these days :)
B0049P1N3K|5.0|I LOVE this book :) it has inspired me to make many positive changes in my life...thanks again Rhonda Byrne
B002HWRYJE|4.0|Has action. Shouldn't disappoint the &#34;trekkies&#34; I'm one of them and I really enjoyed it, even though when I went to watch it in the theaters I thought it was going to disappoint.
B000X2H8G4|2.0|i bought two of these as a christmas present. they do work but not only do they pick up the tv but everything else around them, ie: snoring.
0062082353|5.0|Highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys war/history books. Chris Kyle gives a great first hand account of many different facets of the war, including even the gruesome details. Truly a great read.

B00899DR40|5.0|I would recommend this album to everyone. I love this CD so much. This is one of the few albums I can listen from start to finish. You can definitely tell Usher produced this album and even added some vocals. Considering I loved 8701, I knew JB hooking up with Usher was going to lead to beautiful music. This album is just that, beautiful music!
B00170MYIS|5.0|been taking pictures to see the drainage on the battery, and it is doing well. good battery and being a Sony the quality is there.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|worked actually as ordered. i had lost everything to my kindle in moving. i bought something else that was mis-matched but worked.

B00AEJM6H2|4.0|This is a fun timing game. You only have so much time to get three jewels in a row. It's  alot of  fun. Then when the star comes up you have to get it to the bottom as fast as you can to get stars. Great game!
B00AB0Z88S|3.0|Enjoyable but a little slow and unbelievable in several parts.  Acting was very good, the tiger was definitely the star.
B0064T6LV8|1.0|Just terrible. I can't even begin to describe how frustrating and bad this game was. Half the time I launched the ball, I didn't even get to hit it with my paddles, it would bounce around for a minute, then fall directly in the middle or to the sides. What's the point in playing if you don't get to play? The second free table is awful too; have fun hitting the ball off the walls everywhere in front of your paddles and not being able to use the rest of the machine!
B007FEZQF8|3.0|This book is worthless on the Kindle Paperwhite. The text is too small to read, and the panel zoom feature is broken on large panels. This may be fine on a Kindle Fire, but I ended up using my PC and the Kindle web to read the book. Even then, the site doesn't let you zoom in to the panels on the page. Seems like the DRM has ruined this fine title. I want my money back! I ordered the Compendium One [Paperback] instead of trying to read them all on the Kindle.
1401924751|5.0|I love these cards. If you are ever not sure and need reassurance about what step to make next in your career life then check this deck out. I am always dealing with so many ideas and options that sometimes I loose track so I like having these cards on stand by for help and reminding. Love them! Thank You!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book is awesome, especially if you know a lot about 80's TV, movies, and video games. I starting reading this book on a ten-hour train ride and could not put it down for the entire duration. It seems to be a young adult book because the main characters are all high-school age, but it is a seriously awesome sci-fi/alternate history book for anybody.
B00AQMSJI2|2.0|Very. slow and long download to my kindle fire. Wants you to spend real money to do anything. No instructions on how to play. I made some things happen but only because I kept tapping on different places on the screen. Very good graphics and music.  Do not understand how to play after several attempts. Uninstalled.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Love planting and growing my own sea life. The graphics are beautiful and the game is relaxing and enjoyable. I love Nemo so I enjoy playing in his world. Great for a free app
B006YB9VJU|4.0|it has some trouble to choose some app from the menú to run them.<br />not because it can't but because not all the app are in the list<br /><br />but it has major uses

B008XG1X18|4.0|It's like a adult wishlist &amp; a great way to keep ideas at your fingertips. Stink when webpages expire. But I love it
B00009RGBS|5.0|A true classic with a rocking musical score, the actors are spot on the entire movie, and the dark storyline is absolutely enchanting.  It's to die for!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I really enjoy this game. My mom calls me a dork, but oh well :) I play this game every night before bed. Sometimes I'll be up till even 3am. I've fallen asleep in the middle of playing it and I'll wake up an hour later and start again where I had left off XD
B008P9M614|5.0|I've only recently started watching House.  I decided to purchase the complete set so I could watch all the episodes in order.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Loved this cd, It was on sale , music was great, Got it same week ordered.One of Rod best cds.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I listen to this albumn on repeat in my car.  I highly recommend it.  Im not a big rap music person, but every lyric in this albumn has meaning and makes a lasting impression on me.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I stumbled upon this wonderful book in Amazon's archives and purchased it on a whim. This classic tale of the air war with Germany is written with the rare combination of historic insight and a rare look inside the life of a German ace. This must read account brings us inside the secrets and daily grind of the last days the Luftwaffe as the war ended. This German pilot was a gentleman and an ace.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|The DVD 's were as exciting as the first time I saw them @ the theater.<br />The definition, sound, & color were outstanding.

0767812166|5.0|When movies were GREAT without all of the sex and violence.<br />Just a good old fashioned story.<br />Even my 15 year old daughter liked it .
B002UEW31I|4.0|This is not a movie for those who like their war sagas based on historical fact. Inglourious Basterds is set during WWII, but does not reenact any specific event from that war. There are the usual suspects: Hitler, Churchill, Goebbels, etc. But the most potent character is a Tarantino creation, SS Colonel Hans Landa. Played by Christoph Waltz, Landa is an unsettling mix of charm, sophistication (he speaks four languages in the film), and cold-hearted killer. Waltz's performance is an utter tour de force, and won him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.<br /><br />In the opening scene, Landa comes to interview a French dairy farmer regarding the whereabouts of Jewish families in the area. One family remains unaccounted for.  As their conversation unfolds, it becomes chillingly evident that Landa will not rest until he ascertains the location of the family he is looking for. He slowly and carefully unnerves the farmer--masterfully alternating between charm and thinly veiled threat, until he obtains the information he needs.<br /><br />As I stated, I.B. is a movie, a work of fiction. And it is a Tarantino movie. Meaning you can count on there being graphic violence, stunning dialogue, and unexpected plot twists. Landa's character figures prominently throughout, as does that of a young Jewish woman named Shoshanna Dreyfus. As for the film's title, The Basterds are an eight man group of guerrilla soldiers headed up by Lt. Aldo Raine, played by Brad Pitt. As Raine is part Apache, he tells his men that their strategy will be that of an Apache resistance. Use your imagination. Eventually Raine's and Landa's paths collide. The result is both entertaining and completely unexpected.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simple. Easy. Is almost as convenient as a real one and does just as it is intended to do. What's not to like? :) Thank you!
B00991TCOG|5.0|The only thing better than this CD is seeing Lindsey and her crew in person.  The mix of dubstep and her expert violin are moving and beautiful!
0374214913|4.0|Delightful storytelling - entertaining and thought-provoking. Local SF references added believability to the setting. I could imagine the characters at work and in their quest for understanding the mystery of the 24-Hour bookstore.
B002I9Z8B2|5.0|I don't think I've seen this movie look this good since it was originally in the theaters!!!<br />Seller shipped exactly what was described: The movie is in perfect condition,and I saved a lot of money!! Got it quickly too. Great job!!
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Some more of the same but still enjoyed the movie and I did not fall asleep before the end.  And I need one more word
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|It was like the original story. Alot of the same characters as the Twin Towers and the rest. Just curious if they intend to finish the movie in a second part or not.Would highly recommend this movie.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The storytelling in this book surpasses that of the show. With all the characters involved it is also much easier to follow the histories.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.  It was a shocking perspective on the era of slavery from all sides.  I highly recommend this novel.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|My great granddaughter (2 1/2 years old) loves all of the Dr. Panda apps. I have bought all of them for her and she pretty much plays them every day. They are very educational and fun to play so that they don't know they are learn

B000001E21|3.0|Having grew up with Def Leppard in the 80's,  I would say this is my least favorite album.  There are a few good songs.  Songs from the Sparkle Lounge was muuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuch better if you want their more current sound.
1476733953|5.0|If you are a fan of the post-apocalyptic genre you will love this book!  It's original, fast-paced and truly a great read.  The only disappointing part is the author has not other books!

B009LMTDL0|5.0|I choose this rating because I felt the author spoke not only to women but to the men. I enjoyed the focus of the phrase &#34;lean in&#34; and have used in with my husband, daughters and girl scout troop!
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Life of Pi was one of the best books I've read in a while, I loved it. Often a movie is disappointing when compared to the book but I think they did an excellent job of capturing the essence of the book. There were a few minor changes, which my wife quibbled about but all in all a wonderful job of capturing a magical story. The 3D was nicely done.<br /> The story itself is about an Indian boy who has a great interest in religion (Hindu, Christian, and Muslim) whose family owns a zoo in India. His family leaves India for Canada, taking the animals with (sold to zoos in Canada). The ship sinks in the Pacific and only Pi, a bengal tiger (Richard Parker), an orangatang (Orange Juice), a zebra with a broken leg and a hyena make it into the lifeboat.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|There are benefits to the stage production that you don't get on film, but there is an honesty and emotion in the movie that is lacking on stage. I wouldn't have picked Russel Crowe, Bonham or Cohen for the casting. The Thenardiers are such a delight in the stage production, I was sorely disappointed with the way they were portrayed in the film.
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|Seemed logical and intriguing.  It did seem rather far fetched though when Markie went for the Big guns.  And that the legal system let Markie off the hook for murder.  The government doesn't let people go because they're innocent, when they need a scapegoat, you go down for the count whether you did it or not.  And even if proven innocent, for their egos, the government sends you to the chair to silence you.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|If this movie was marketed as an Evil Dead 2 or Dead Alive, it would have been a hit. I went into this movie knowing it was a horror action comedy. After I saw it, its all I could talk about. I'm really excited for the unrated cut, seeing that the movie went over the top in theaters.
B00BQHA06A|5.0|Been a Fan for around 10-13 years, and i can say this is a good album, why? listen to it a couple of times and let it grow, you will find yourself coming back to it and singing along in no time.<br /><br />I'm giving it 5 stars because it looks like they really worked on it and you can really tell there's a lot of heart that was put into it.<br /><br />I would love to have one more Venus Doom (dark and mysterious)<br />but then again every HIM album is different , Love the artwork , Love the Lyrics, Love the album.<br /><br />Compare it to other \\"metal\\" \\"alternative\\" albums out there, there's nothing quite like this.<br /><br />fav tracks (so far): All Lips go blue,Love without tears ,W.L.S.T.D, Drawn and quartered .

B0024Y7H10|2.0|This show is just ok. If you ask me every terminator show/movie needs<br />\\"Arnold Schwarzenegger\\" Arnold acting style put terminator on the map it may be the good one liners Arnold had.<br />These TV actors just dont cut it sometimes. Like the Matrix talk is all quiet and you cant hear them sometimes. Special affects are good for a TV show but its full of Misandry messages. Just like terminator 3 a female terminator is a better model and can do anything.

1451695195|4.0|The book is interesting, however, I question all the details the author presents.  In times of crises I would think all the details of conversations and other events would be fuzzy for the patient experiencing an NDE and his/her family. Who was taking notes?
B000H30B2C|5.0|I was looking for this film in the extended cut, and thought I would read the 1 star ratings of this movie in case of bad quality discs, cases, etc... and instead came upon the elitist musings of some really weird people.<br /><br />Comparing this film to the 1933 original is like comparing a Model T to my 1999 SC300.  It is ridiculous at its core, and though all are entitled to their opinion, to lambaste this zoological CGI wonderland as some sort of cheap knock off is dull at best.  Take your mother to the grocery store first and give it a think before you write another movie review.<br /><br />One dude actually said the facial expressions of the 1976 Kong were better than Jackson's Kong. That may be one of the dumbest things I have ever read, and the author cannot be serious, save some sort of neurotic \\"opposite\\" disorder. I am a lifelong zoologist who is as big a stickler for CGI animal movement in movies that there is.  Realism is everything, and it gets better all the time.  At the TOP of the craft is Peter Jackson and WETA.<br /><br />Another douche crowed about how fake the animals looked, and referred to it as \\"two movies clumsily put together\\", or something to that effect.  This is drivel, obviously written by someone who knows ZERO about animal morphology or behavior.<br /><br />The animals in Jackson's Kong look fantastic, and to say otherwise is nothing short of a glaring testimony to one's lack of knowledge on the subject.  When one says they look fake, when they don't at all, it implies (to me anyway) that you wish us to believe you have some perception the rest of us lack. When in reality it is just the opposite.<br /><br />I could write for days about how stupid some of the reasons and rationalizations given for giving this film 1 star were, but I won't.  I just wanted to tip some of you off, so you could go read a couple of these reviews and wonder, as I did, what the heck these sniveling little movie snob weasels are thinking.  It is truly bizarre.<br /><br />This movie is not perfect by any stretch, however.  Some scenes are too long, and it takes too long for Kong to enter. Black failed in his attempt to utter the famous final line, and in my opinion, his character should have died a dramatic Kong death, like Grodin did in 1976.<br /><br />But I don't enjoy second guessing Peter Jackson, one of Gods gifts to cinema..<br /><br />This movie is not perfect by any stretch, however.

B00BI6SSMC|3.0|Let it not be said that I am a man unreceptive to change. I have enjoyed many a band over the years that has, in some way or another, decided to evolve from their less mainstream roots into something a little more pop-friendly (Pixies, The Decemberists, Guided by Voices, etc).<br /><br />However Sam Beam's push into said territory presents a completely different problem. The problem, per se, is not with the evolution, but rather with the end result. \\"Ghost on Ghost\\" is far and away the band's most pop-oriented album to date (which is saying a lot after \\"Kiss Each Other Clean\\"), but at the end of the day that's not what is wrong with this album: Sam just doesn't seem to be playing to his strengths.<br /><br />Gone completely are the simple melodies and sparse accompaniment of Beam's earliest work, now indistinguishably replaced by orchestral pomp and schmaltzy horn sections on nearly every track. Some songs, like \\"The Desert Babbler\\" and \\"New Mexico's No Breeze,\\" hide hints of Beam's gentle song craft with grating, saccharine indie-pop instrumentation and others still just seem to be trying too hard to sound like more conventional indie-folk songs from the likes of Belle and Sebastian (\\"Grace for Saints and Ramblers\\") and Sufjan Stevens.<br /><br />All that said, though, there's still a lot to like about this album. A few of the tracks still deliver that melancholic, Southern-Gothic narrative that we've all come to know and love from Mr. Beam (like \\"Low Light Buddy of Mine\\" and \\"Winter Prayers\\"), and on the other side of the coin, many of them are just pleasant little pop songs (\\"Joy\\" and \\"Grass Widows\\")<br /><br />So no, it's not a complete misfire, but I can't help but feel like Sam might be headed down a rocky path with no shoes.

0812993845|3.0|At the beginning of this year, a friend STRONGLY recommended the Shopaholic series and she is usually right so I read all the books over about a period of just a few weeks. I enjoyed them all and found them to be a wonderful, light-hearted diversion. When I discovered I could get this latest offering from the same author, I leapt at the chance and was eagerly looking forward to several hours of being highly entertained. I don't need to go into the plot since the book description provided is very good and complete. What I will talk about is my reaction to the book, and whether or not I would recommend it.<br /><br />During the opening pages, I was quite enthused. The set-up is very good and I was intrigued by having two protagonists this time out. It seemed that this could add a bit of freshness to the novel since Ms. Kinsella usually only focuses on one person. So far so good. However, somewhere around page 80 or so the book started going off the tracks. The Shopaholic books are fun and silly but there is an endearing quality to Becky that makes you cheer for her. She is clever plus lucky --- somehow it works. These characters, unfortunately, don't work. Both women were hard for me to warm up to and the situations so ludicrous that I couldn't find enjoyment and just go along for the ride. Even the men that populate this book (particularly the character of Ben) were difficult to care about. It wasn't until toward the end of the book that things picked up. It became entertaining and ended on a much higher note than the majority of the book.<br /><br />Good beginning, good ending, and close to horrible middle section (over half the book was difficult for me to get through and I would have liked to quit). Difficult to rate when it was so all-over-the place but will settle on 3-stars, but a very LOW 3-stars --- almost only 2. I think there is a bit of halo effect here that it is difficult to give an author that I have enjoyed previously only 2-stars but I really, really thought about it. Not sure I will be running out and reading the next one. If you are a fan and want to read this, I would recommend you get it from the library or wait until it comes out in paperback.thought about it.

B0051UP5NQ|1.0|almost completely useless....  Horrible user experience (human-computer interaction).  Minimally compatible with Microsoft file formats.  Needlessly requires significantly dangerous permissions to do things I don't want it to do.  The &#34;free&#34; version is apparently hard-wired into my KFHD 8.9 (at least I haven't found viable means to remove it).  I foolishly decided to try the &#34;pro&#34; version on assumption it would be more useful and usable.  My mistake.

0544139453|2.0|I found the protagonist/narrator completely unlikable and unsympathetic throughout the story and felt that his anti-Americanism resulted more from his thwarted sense of entitlement and bad choices than from any truly awful thing that happened to him during his 4 and a half years in America.  I haven't read anything by Moshin Hamid before and I don't know anything about him or his style, so I'm not sure if he wrote this character in earnest or if he deliberately provided us with an unreliable narrator and we're supposed to see that he's more responsible for his anti-Americanism than America is, but I'm leaning towards the latter. Changez must be an unreliable narrator, right? He couldn't possibly be that obtuse.<br /><br />First I'll address his bad choices. Changez took a completely soulless job with a vulture capitalism type firm because it was high paying and prestigious.  He ended up hating it and the brand of capitalism the firm practiced.  Honestly, what did he expect? He knew what the firm was about when he took the job, but rather than just accept that he wasn't a good match for the job and find another one, he blamed American capitalism for his discontent and used it to fuel his resentment.  Lots of people hate their jobs. He had other options. He could have found more satisfying, soulful work.<br /><br />The other bad choice he made was his devotion to a woman who was mentally ill. She made it abundantly clear early in the relationship that she was obsessed with her deceased former boyfriend and Changez himself quickly realized she was, in his own words, \\"broken.\\" Rather than cut his losses and move on, he continues to pursue her and develop deeper feelings for her despite her lack of response. He continues to pursue her even after she's committed to a mental hospital.  His heartbreak also fuels his anti-Americanism, presumably because arranged marriages, common in Pakistan, prevent that sort of heartbreak, or maybe because she wouldn't have had any agencyto deny him his heart's desire in his culture. But it wasn't American promiscuity or hook up culture or the way contemporary American relationships are conducted that caused his problems, it was his own naivety and lack of experience. Had he had more dating experience, something foreign to his culture, he would have recognized that Erica was a lost cause very early and moved on. Seriously, dude, all she talked about from the very beginning was her dead boyfriend. Clue in!<br /><br />He also complained about the way he was treated after 911. Yes, middle-easterners were treated with suspicion and at times outright hostility after 911. It was wrong to paint all middle easterners with the same broad brush and other them. But what he complains of is actually relatively mild. He received suspicious looks, customs delays and one truly aggressive, hostile encounter. Not pleasant and not fair, I agree, but here are some other people who are viewed with suspicion and hostility in America and discrimination: fat people, people of color, LGBT folks, old people, disabled people, and yes, occasionally, even white men.<br /><br />Also, simply put, Changez had a huge sense of entitlement. America owed him. New York City owed him. Erica owed him. He deserved a prestigious, high-paying and fulfilling job. He deserved Erica's love even though she clearly wasn't capable of giving it. He deserved to always be treated with nothing but deference and the highest respect at all times. His expectations were completely unrealistic and rather than come across as a sympathetic character whose disappointment we can empathize with, he just came across as a spoiled whiner. This is why I have to believe Hamid intended him to be an unreliable narrator because if he's not, he's completely tone deaf.<br /><br />Changez's other problem was that he was so solipsistic. He couldn't consider any perspective but his own and I think that's what made him feel so isolated and like such an outsider. Lots of people hate their jobs. Lots of people have their hearts broken. Lots of people hate the decisions that come out of Washington, D.C. Lots of people are picked on, discriminated against, disappointed and feel out of place even in their own families, but most of them have perspective. They're able to look inside and see if maybe they're the problem. They're able to find other people like them and relate to them and make a connection and stop feeling so alone and misunderstood. Not poor, privileged, Princeton-educated Changez. In the end he was just too much of an entitled little princeling to mature enough to see beyond himself and chose instead to stay a perpetual rage-filled adolescent.  Again, this is why I feel like Changez must have been written as an unreliable narrator. He simply couldn't be this clueless, right?<br /><br />Did I like the book? No, I was too annoyed by Changez and his whining and his persecution complex to enjoy the story and I found the narrative style contrived and off-putting. However, given the length of my comments, I clearly found the book though-provoking, and for that it was a worthwhile read.
B0083Z6AH6|3.0|I really liked this book. I liked it enough that this is me third or fourth reading. So, how could I give it only a three star rating? I found some of the descriptions and dialogs stilted. This may have been from Miss Austen 's naivety. The basic plot was well thought out along with appropriate twists and surprises. I'm a sucker for romance. I will probably reread this book in another year or two. I really liked it. It's a good example of a period work of literature.

B00BFBSV72|5.0|I love this game, it is awesome. But, I just have one small issue with it....there's a roster of other playable characters to play besides sonic, which is great, but they forgot shadow, which is a bit of a disappointment for me. It seems they replaced him with silver, which is fine I guess, but it's not the same. I hope they make other games similar to this one, but please Sega, include shadow in more games where he's available to play as well.<br />Other than that, it's an overall great game, and fun to play on breaks at work :)
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|It is a really fun game, but can not keep your progress accurately. For example I can have an x amount of coins and level 10 of a certain shark. Next time I get back on I have way less coin and have not even earned the shark that I was a level 10 on. Stopped playing it until this gets fixed. Too frustrating.

0062238868|5.0|This book, by Chris Kyle, is a riveting story about the Iraq War from the front lines - from an individual who was there getting shot at and seeing his buddies get wounded and killed. Yes, he killed a lot of the \\"savages\\", as he calls them but it was to save the lives of other Americans who were in harm's way. He is a true American Hero, Someone that we should all look up to. Chris Kyle was there in all the major actions of the Iraq War: the starting invasion, Fallujah, Ramadi, and the end in Sadr City. He saw it all and experienced what no man should have to experience and he did it for us - his fellow Americans and his fellow soldiers.<br />The stories are riveting. The firefights are told in such detail that you almost feel that you are there. When he related the story about the Marine who was gut shot and died in his arms, it made me think about how 18 year old kids sign their lives away to protect the country that they love. The stories about Ryan Job and Marc Lee being shot in combat was really sad and really powerful, how they gave all they had before they were taken out of combat makes me want to be a Navy SEAL.  I can see why he was remorseless in killing the \\"savages\\" - many times in the book, he wrote: \\"I dropped him.\\"<br />The impact on his family life too was eye-opening. At times, he let his wife, Taya; write her experiences and what she was feeling at different times. The one time that he called her and a firefight occurred and he thought that he hung up but he didn't, and she heard the whole thing on the phone... She is a true American Hero also for supporting him through four tours over there.<br />In the dedication, Chris Kyle writes: \\"I would like to dedicate this to the memory of my SEAL brothers Marc and Ryan, for their courageous service to our country and their undying friendship to me. I will bleed for their deaths the rest of my life.\\" Having never been in combat, I can't even fathom the experiences that he, his fellow SEALS, Marines and Army warriors went through over there. But, I can thank him and his wife for writing this book and at least giving us a glimpse of what it was like to live this. This book should be a classic on war and warriors - an excellent story about the heroism and tragedy of war.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this game, it's very relaxing....I've read some complaints about people having issues with having to buy stuff with real money to progress....Well, you actually don't have to buy anything if you just have some patience :)<br />Yes, some plants and items may take extra time to build or grow, and I say, if you're impatient, then don't play this, or get over it.<br />This game can be fun for all ages, with patience, and love for the characters, it can be fun, and you should have a good time. :)

I could not believe that a 21 year old, college graduate, who had never had sex before, would be turned on to such bizarre and brutal treatment.  I don't care how gorgeous the guy is!  Even my two daughters found it tasteless.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book to anyone.

B007X6SMD6|4.0|This guide is very short and very basic but they do try to point you to the correct guide. A necessary read if you need guidance on where to go for info.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I missed the 2nd book so I increasingly now<br />Please, let me start the next book.maybe I will rate the next one.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Thinking about how I would describe this movie only one word came to mind: raw. While I'm thankful I've never been in this situation, watching the film made me very much aware of just how intense everything that goes with such a horrible disaster could be for the survivors. The actor's hit their characters' emotions spot on in this story so much that I found myself saying a silent prayer for all the victims and survivors and it's already been almost nine years since the tragedy.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I was skeptical at the beginning and the price was much higher than most games available in the Kindle store. However I purchased this and was blown away this is a true Final Fantasy game with the same graphics you would find on the Nintendo DS version. Buy and you won't regret it.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Awesome season, can't wait to read the books.  The video quality could have been better, but the Wii is not know for HD streaming ability.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|THIS STORY OF SGT. YORK IS MORE THAN A MOVIE.  YOU CAN FEEL THE WAY IT WAS TOO LIVE PRE WWI. IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET, TRY IT YOU'LL LIKE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AJER3SE|4.0|True to his word the Terminator has been reborn with more faithful detail in this digital remaster of a classic movie.<br /><br />The digital remaster has produced a superior copy with less noise and blacker blacks.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|If you have ever played scribblenauts, then this is the app for you. If you haven't, then this is a good place to start. 5 worlds filled with ten levels each. That's a total of fifty different levels. Use the notepad to create items to get the starite (basically like the star in Mario). This one will keep you entertained for a long time, thanks to the playground, where you can spend endless amounts of time just doing whatever it is you want. Floating purple penguins, firebreathing winged cows, whatever you want. Great app for all ages.
B009K72G8I|5.0|After getting hooked into the past 4 seasons and ending with such a finale I was crushed to learn that after their acquisition by Disney this series (along with many other Star Wars projects) the series would be effectively canceled. Try not let that dissuade you as the stories are well worth it.
B00BD07SGU|5.0|This is an incredible release!! For me, this is such a big bounce back from 2011's \\"The Beginning of Times\\" and a very mystical, heavy record. I ordered a limited edition release with two awesome bonus tracks \\"Dead Man's Dream\\" and \\"New Song\\", along with a really cool DVD showing a rockumentary behind the scenes in the making of the new album, a music video for \\"Nightbird's Song\\", and a photo gallery from the album recording sessions. All in all, this could very well be one of my absolute favorite Amorphis albums! It is a very refreshing, exciting listen and these songs are among the best I've heard this band create (such as \\"Narrow Path\\", \\"Mission\\", and \\"Nightbird's Song\\") with some of my least favorites even becoming big and highly enjoyable growers (like \\"Hopeless Days\\" and \\"The Wanderer\\"). A superb and highly essential release from these prog/folk/melodic death metal legends.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I recently downloaded the Hunger Games Trilogy onto my Kindle and I love it! A very good deal when I got it.
0760703329|4.0|This is a very nice, leatherbound addition.  For a facsimile reproduction, it is easy to read and looks very nice.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this 2nd book even more than the 1st and can't wait to read the 3rd. I think I liked it more because there are so many changes between Christian and Ana and they still remain together. I just get swept away in all the romance and the kinky stuff too, it sounds like a life I wished I could lead.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Need to be able to remember how to slide when needed and do the other moves that I need to learn.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google is the best search engine ever inverted. Not as private as Bing or Yahoo but when you need to search far and wide it's the best. I use Google on all my device's.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE IT AND SO DOES MY BROTHER WE ARE BOTH 11 AND WE PLAY LIKE 24/7 ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT OMG CHECK OUT PINEAPPLE MAP ITS AWESOME THERE IS WATERFALLS ON THE HIGHEST MOUNTAINS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!AGAIN ITS AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I was very pleased with the last movie of the trilogy! It was everything I expected if not more! I wish it was over.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So addicting  and creative !!!! Nothing like the other games, it's original and a must play. It's such a thrill to gain new characters nd set records for yourself!
B0063M22QO|4.0|Same as above.  A little better than above.  Would be nice to be able to undo a mistaken choice and shuffle before you have too.
B008CIUS72|1.0|Forget it, doesn't work, can't play video with this. That's all I need it for and I just can't stream my uverse on Kindle. I give up.
1596177373|3.0|Unfortunately there are only pictures of characters on the face cards, ace, and jokers. Also, cards are really slick and kind of difficult to play with. So, not the greatest quality, but I like them.
B009YX02T8|5.0|Was awesome I waited so long it seemed to see it since I read the book before the movies ever came out! was great more than I expected!
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|Not really a Tom Cruise fan.<br />I thought this was well done movie. I can't think of any holes in the movie.<br />The dialog was pretty good. The cinematography was very good. I liked the look<br />of the movie.<br />Good action. Might go as far as saying a thriller.<br /> It is a very good movie, one of the better ones I have seen in a year.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Not so special.  I enjoy playing the game for using up time, but timer is short for all that has to get done.
B0073TZ1AA|5.0|It uses whatever TTS you have installed, in my case: Ivona (which I highly recommend I just hope they don't charge too much once it finally goes out of beta because I know for a fact that it helps handicapped people, who usually don't have a lot of money, enjoy books).<br /><br />This app works great with PDF files and its a program I been looking for for a long long time. It definitely fills a need and a desire to have books read to me sometimes. I'm glad to finally have something I could \\"read aloud\\" a book with that I have in PDF format. This app is awesome, it works great and it seems to be rock solid because I can't do anything to trip it up. I do wish they would explain the permissions better however, but I don't think its enough to deduct a star because I don't see anything which I consider to be too alarming.<br /><br />Since I cannot find any other fault with this app--I give it five stars.<br /><br />Oh and I noticed that some people are complaining that this app supposedly \\"limits where they can browse for files\\". Not quite. You see, if you understand your filesystem then you would know that you can browse anywhere that you are allowed to based on your user permissions simply by going to this path: /mnt then /sdcard and you would be at the root of your SD card (for example). if you have an external SD card as well then it might be called something like /mnt/sdcard2 or similar. I highly recommend that you look up about the Android file system (which is built on the Linux file system) online and learn about it a little bit. it will save you a lot of grief with not only this program but probably many others and then you would know how to easily navigate your own phone or tablet and find things. :)<br /><br />But please don't blame the author(s) of this program for your own inability to find your own files. It's not their fault.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|SPOILER!! I can see why Mr. Thomas Cruise chose to take on this film... I saw several parallels to his Scientology beliefs (Which is not a bad thing).  In thought this was a fairly original idea..Except for the part when Cruise flies up the bomb to the big ship..It felt like I was watching Will Smith In \\"Independence Day\\".  This is a clever movie in several ways, but the dialogue could have been greatly improved in some areas.  I also felt uncomfortable in every scene where Morgan Freeman was in..He was out of place and would have much rather watched a no name actor play the part.  It is a fun piece to watch and I am glad I paid a fortune to see it at the theatre.  Cruise looks as good as ever and does some decent acting.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|saw all the reviews and wanted to see what all the hype was. glad i did.  i was hooked from the opening paragraph to the last.
1606995359|5.0|Decades ago, Uncle Scrooge was always my favorite. This Christmas, Santa brought this compendium to one child. Did not anticipate that everyone including all the adults would want to read it. Had to establish a reading rota. Everyone received a big comic omnibus, but this was the one everyone wanted to read first.
0451205766|5.0|There are some books that are just pointless writing a review about and this is one. This is one of the greatest books ever. Mario Puzo has left us a literal legacy we will forever be grateful for. I don't think there is anything to say that has not been said before about this book. But what I will add, the movie was a masterpiece but to me it failed in only one area, it didn't build on Luca Brasi and it didn't tell a lot about how the Godfather became the man he was. If you haven't read this book, you need to buy the book the book, lock yourself in a room and read it. A Classic.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|I enjoyed Stargate Universe every bit as much as I did SG1 and Stargate Atlantis.  I believe the producers made a huge mistake in cancelling the show after only two seasons.  With the entire universe as its playground, SGU could have gone on forever.<br />Nevertheless, this fine series is now a permanent addition to my DVD library and I'm sure most SCI-FI buffs.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|My greatgrandson loved it,and so did I.It was worth the wait.Well be buying number 5 when it come out...soon bye
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I love this movie, especially time period movies.  Plus Richard Armitage is in this movie which makes it even more pleasant to watch.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This is a great deal for the performance you get. Its excellent for single threaded applications and competitive for multithread applications.
0451169514|3.0|Like all Stephen King's books the idea is irresistible. Kids who came together and defeated an evil clown, have o come back together years after to defeat the evil clown when it returns.  I liked the book a lot, my only problem with Stephen King's large novels, he tends to talk about stuff I feel are irrelevant to the story or are just not necessary to the story line. His short's stories, are amazing and to the point. It was a good book and I liked the way he correlated the characters as children and adults.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I like the book. It has interesting characters. It brings out  twists and turns of history that I was not familiar with. I read 'The Fall of Giants' that started in 1911 and led thru WWI. This one starts between Wars and continues with the same families and historical characters. I plan to read the third in the series.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|You are swept in right away by the characters and held there as you see your history lessons unfolding in their lives. Superbly written.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Really enjoyed the quality of this series and story line.  It is the best television American viewers have seen in a long time.  Hope that this series is around for a while and a few more seasons.  Beautiful scenery featuring the Highclere Castle and grounds.  This series transports the viewer to a different time.  Love Downton Abbey.
0440244412|5.0|I love Karen Marie Moning's booki and this was great.  I love the MacKayla Lane stories.  Just ordered the new one. Ordering through Amazon works great and I have always gotten my books when promised.
0143038095|4.0|The book is about Mothers and Daughters, mothers with history so rich and colorful in the heart of china and daughters whose life are so modern yet, intersecting the life of their mothers. It follows the mothers lives in China, their lives in San Francisco, whilst detailing the daughters lives in modern society and their perspectives of their mother. It was a very satisfying book.
B00CAJP0ZO|1.0|No sense to waste or mince words. This album sucks even more than the past work by Will.I.Am (and BEP). Utter mess of lyrics if you can call them that and a ridiculous amount of copying and theft from other songs or ideas. 0 Stars.
B00AA0TZTW|3.0|I like this CD.  It is hard not to like Jimi Hendrix.  I feel that many of the songs just seem the same.  For example, the first two songs both have the same lyrics to start.  The later tracks on the CD also just kind of sound the same.  If you are a die hard Hendrix fan it's worth checking out, but if you are just discovering Jimi avoid it until later.
B000JLQSW4|4.0|With a fair remaster. There is a lot of track, of course, that seem experimental, and for the time it was released, may have seemed more than it is now, goofy  monotonous synthesizers going nowhere. However! There are some quality rock tunes and slow tunes on this album that must never be forgotten. And, as I plan, one should attain every APP album: you will find great tunes amidst them all. Or, if you are lucky, as I was not, you may find an essential remastered album. But, ALWAYS go for the remastered versions.
B00002469S|5.0|I am very happy with the service provided by this vendor. The cd came right on time, the sound is great & I listen to it often. Very soothing & brings back a lot of od memories.<br /><br />Love it!<br />Thank You,<br />EA
0062012339|4.0|A true story of Motley Crue. First things first, this is an autobiography like no other. It takes you into the lives of this rock stars from each of the bandmates perspective, chronologically. What I loved about the book, was the truth of it, it was wasn't polished or censored. You literally read from each of the band members through their ups and downs, their good times and bad. The added pluses to the book was the unintended cameos, like Pamela Anderson, Sharon and Ozzy Osborne, Mel Gibson, Vanity 6 and Kiss. Don't think you've read everything, until you've read this book. It will shock you and also get you laughing aimlessly. A very good read.
B007AJFSJW|5.0|Paul Krugman's  book is enlightening and should be read by any person interested in putting this nation back to a full recovery. Our main job today is to put people back to work. As President Roosevelt has stated  &#34;Our great primary task is to put people to work, we should treat that task as we would treat the emergency of a war.&#34;  Yes, we have a serious national debt problem today, but austerity measures is not the answer, witness Europe today. This book gives the reader the correct answer.  Put people to work, they spend money, pay taxes and create demand for products that industry responds too.<br /><br />'
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I bought this years ago, but it's probably one of my favorite albums I have. Also the last album I will buy, but well worth the buy. Especially since I saw them in concert.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great movie. I loved the portrayal of every character. The movie stayed true to the book. Looking forward to the next installment.
0547884591|5.0|I just want to start off by saying; for anyone who is learning how to cook, I think this book is essential. I am an experienced cook, and really enjoy it, so the recipes were nothing new to me. What I did find to be very useful were the tools section, where Tim lists all of the Minimum Effective Dose kitchen tools for a chef to buy, and they are very inexpensive! Also, the memorization and language learning parts of the book were great! There was a couple of good \\"cheat day\\" recipes as well. Another fantastic job by Mr. Ferriss.
1594202842|4.0|Reading this book, I had the same nostalgic state as reading the bible. Amy Chua doesn't hide the truth the way it was, the book doesn't show life the way she sees it, but more like the way it is. It's incredible the arguments this novel has erupted on my dinner table, but I believe everyone should read this book first without prejudice and please don't stop midway, you need to read it to the end to fully appreciate the art of the tiger mum.
B003O86FMW|5.0|You wonder as a reader how a 2nd book could possibly engage you as much as the first.  Mission accomplished!  Can't wait for Mockingjay.
B004TI5N38|5.0|It was a great book.  One of those that you have to keep reading to find out what happens next!!  The best kind of book!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I personally don't think you can get much more addictive it looks boring if your watching someone else play it and then you try it and you can't stop.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|'Towers' is my favorite.  'Flower Power' earns the most coins in the shortest amount of time.  I also enjoy 'Squares'.
0316017930|5.0|This is a master at work, after reading the book, what goes through your head is why I hadn't figured this out myself. Malcolm Gladwell is so great at using the simpliest of language to define complex realities. His theory stretches geographic locations and time and still brings you to the defined reality. A truly beautiful read.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|This movie is one of my kids favorites!  They love watching this movie over and over.  I even loved watching and got great laughs, which the kids though was really funny watching me!
B003FL4O9E|1.0|Forgot how lame this movie was.  I also forgot they made several of those puffy NONanimated movies.  This one has a girl in it for 5 TMNT.  What the heck!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|loving it so far! Very addictive, can't put it down most of the time. recommend it for just any player.
B003L77G8I|4.0|This isn't my fave season, I'm more of the mindset that Brennan man-trapped Booth. The discs were in great shape, no pixelations or skipping. I would recommend for any Bones fan.
